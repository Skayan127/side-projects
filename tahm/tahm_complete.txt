- So, what do you think?
- Wow.

It's for you, right?

It's for both of us. Don't go away.

Don't worry. There's not enough blood
left in my legs to go anywhere.

Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

Listen, you lousy S.O.B.,
I will not be treated like this.

Either you call me,
or you are gonna be very, very sorry.

I love you, Monkey Man.

Charlie?

Who was that?

Damn telemarketers.

A telemarketer who calls you
Monkey Man?

I'm on some weird list.

Okay, it's a woman I went out with once
and she got a little clingy.

You are a bad, bad boy.

And yet, you're always the one
getting spanked.

Jeez.

Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

Charlie, it's Alan. Your brother.

No big deal, just wanted to touch base.

My wife threw me out,
and I'm kind of losing the will to live.

So, when you get a chance,
I'd really love to... I don't know...

Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.

So, where you gonna go, to a hotel? Wow.

Well, yeah, I guess you could stay here.

Okay. I'll see you when you get here.

We better hurry.

Is she staying over?
Because I may have parked behind her.

Twelve years,
and she just throws me out.

I mean, what was the point
of our wedding vows?

You know, "Till death do us part. "
Who died? Not me. Not her.

How did you get in my house?

Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock
only works if it's among other rocks.

Not sitting on your welcome mat.

Excuse me, but if you put the fake rock
in with a bunch of other rocks,

it's impossible to find when
you're drunk.

You know, I'm a good husband.
I'm faithful.

- Is she?
- Is she what?

Faithful.

Don't be ridiculous.
Judith doesn't even like sex.

I mean, all she kept saying was
she feels suffocated, you know?

She kept going on and on,
"I'm suffocating. "

What does that mean, you know?
Has a woman ever said that to you?

Well, yeah.

But not a woman who doesn't like sex.

And Jake. This could just destroy Jake.

- Jake?
- My son.

Teenagers are pretty sophisticated
these days.

He's 10.

- Charlie, I'm going to go.
- No.

You two need to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow.

I'm sorry to hear about you
and your wife.

Come on, you leaving isn't gonna
bring them back together again.

Look, okay,
this is just until things settle out.

A couple of days max.
She will come to her senses.

Yeah. That's what women do.

Look, you can have the guest room.
I'll grab some sheets.

That's okay. I brought my own.

You brought your own sheets?

I like my sheets.

- Okay, then, good night.
- No, wait.

I mean, we hardly ever talk
to each other.

What do you want to talk about, Alan?

I don't know.

I was named Chiropractor of the Year

by the San Fernando
Valley Chiropractic Association.

- Okay, then. Good night.
- No.

Charlie, what about you?

What's going on with you?

Well, Alan, there's not much to say.

I make a lot of money
for doing very little work.

I sleep with beautiful women
who don't ask about my feelings.

I drive a Jag, I live at the beach,

and sometimes in the middle of the day,
for no reason at all,

I like to make myself
a big pitcher of margaritas

and take a nap out on the sundeck.

- Okay, then. Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.

Good night, Monkey Man.

Boy, is your eye red.

You should see it from in here.

What are you doing here, Jake?

My mom brought me.

Will you take me swimming in the ocean?

Can we talk about it
after my head stops exploding?

Why is your head exploding?

Well, I drank a little too much wine
last night.

If it makes you feel bad,
why do you drink it?

Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.

You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
You said "ass. "

Tell you what,

here's $20.
That should cover me till lunch.

Now, what I think you need to do
is to make a list.

On one side, put what you don't like
about our marriage,

and on the other side, what you do.

Alan, sometimes when I think
about coming home to you,

I start crying in my car.

Okay, that would probably
go on the "don't" side.

Why would I lie?
The ocean is closed today.

For God's sake, do you think
you could put some pants on?

Look at me, Judy.
I could barely make it down the stairs.

Charlie, could you and Jake...

Yeah, come on, kid,
we'll have breakfast out on the deck.

I already had breakfast.

- Okay, we'll have lunch.
- It's not lunchtime.

That's his head exploding.

Judith, I can change.

Please, Alan.
You are the most rigid, inflexible,

obsessive, anal-retentive man
I've ever met.

Rigid and inflexible?

Don't you think that's a little
redundant?

My mom and dad are splitting up.

Yeah. It looks that way.

You're lucky.

When I was your age, I could only dream
about my parents splitting up.

- Your mom is my grandma.
- Yep.

Grandma says
you're a bitter disappointment.

Hey, sport,
your mom wants to say goodbye.

Listen, he doesn't know anything
about what's going on,

so let's just keep this to ourselves.

Our little secret.
Why is she saying goodbye to him?

She's gonna be spending the weekend
with her sister in Vegas.

So, we decided that
Jake would stay with me.

With you?

Well, with us.

I'm hungry.

Is this gonna be a problem?

I guess not.

Thanks. Listen, I've got to
call my office.

Would you mind making him lunch?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

What are you smiling about?

You don't have any food.

Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.

Who's smiling now, shorty?

- You drink milk?
- Just with cereal.

- Okay.
- Not that milk. That milk.

- What's the difference?
- That's Dairy Farm. We drink Dairy Barn

Fine. Happy?

Why would I be happy? It's just milk.

Cute. Keep it up,
you'll be on one of the cartons.

Okay, cereal.

We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs,
Frosted Flakes and Maple Loops.

I want Maple Loops.

It's got oats and corn and wheat
It's the sweetest breakfast treat

It's maple maple maple-licious

You know who wrote that song?

- Your uncle Charlie wrote that.
- No lie?

If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote
Stairway to Heaven,

not the Maple Loops song.

- You two are really good together.
- Thank you.

So, does your wife sing, too?

- No, I'm not married.
- What a shame.

Wow. You're even better than a dog.

Dr. Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.

My wife and I need to cancel our marriage
counseling appointment for this afternoon.

Yes, well, something came up.

Well, it's kind of personal. I mean...

Well, yeah,
I know the point of these things is...

I've got to go.

- Hello?
- Is Charlie home?

No. I'm Charlie's brother.
Can I help you?

Hi, Charlie's brother. I'm Rose.

I'm Charlie's housekeeper.

So, you're a housekeeper?

Housekeeper/actress/hand model.

I just do this to keep the wolf
from the door.

You know what I mean?

Sure. Come on in.

Yeah, I can smell him.

Smell who?

Your brother. He has a very musky scent.

Well, I'll just let you get to work.

Wait.

No. It's okay.

It's got oats and corn and wheat
It's the sweetest breakfast treat

It's maple maple ma...

Jake, buddy. Take a break.

What took you so long?

We stopped for ice cream
because I'm a babe magnet.

I got to take a squirt.

Why do you assume
he learned that from me?

Because I learned it from you.

- Hey, thanks for cleaning up.
- No, it wasn't me. Rose was here.

Rose? You let Rose into my house?

She said she was your maid.

Hell, she glued the damn cabinets
shut again.

Again?

You've got somebody who comes in
regularly to glue your cabinets?

You've met some of the whack jobs
I've gone out with.

- It's not that big a stretch.
- So, this is my fault?

Who let her in?

You're a deeply disturbed man,
you know? Move it. Come on.

I'm deeply disturbed?

Who came here in the middle
of the night with his own sheets?

At least, I care what I sleep on.
Or should I say, who I sleep on.

Hey, pal, of the two of us,

I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept
with a married woman recently.

And isn't that something to brag about?

Hi, Mom.

Do you have any idea how hurtful it is

to hear about your own son's divorce
on the street?

What divorce? What street?

How did you get in my house?

You stay out of this.

I'm here to help your brother
through a very difficult time.

How could you do this to me?

Do what?

Now when I want to see my grandson

I am going to have to make
an appointment with Judith,

who, let's face it,
was never very warm to me.

And what if there's another man there?
Shacking up with her?

Have we even stopped to consider that?

I think he's considering it now, Mom.

- Here's your iced tea, Grandma.
- Thank you, my little angel.

Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.

All right.
Here's what you're going to do.

You and Jake will come live with me.

After all, I'm just rattling around
in that big house all by myself.

That's very considerate, but as soon as
Judith and I work things out,

I'm going to be back at my own house.

Sweetheart, grow up.

Think about what I said.

You're my son, and I'll always have room
for you in my house

and in my heart.

I love you, too, Mom.

- I love you, too, Mom.
- Too little. Too late.

- So, Vegas was good?
- It was fine.

Alan, I really want to apologize
for putting you through this.

I was wrong to blame you
for my unhappiness.

No, no need to apologize.

What's important is that we're here
and we're working on our marriage.

You look great, by the way.

Must be all the extra oxygen
they pump into the casinos.

- Alan...
- And you were right.

I see now that the time apart
did us both a lot of good.

I know I've grown.

I'm not that suffocating guy
you threw out of the house

four and a half days ago,
let me tell you that.

Jake's doing fine.

You were concerned about him
being around my brother,

but Charlie's great with kids.

All right, last card, down and dirty.

King's bet.

- $1.
- I'm in.

In.

I'll see $1 and raise it $5.

You raised $5 on that?

- I call.
- I call.

Queens full of nines.

Kid,
don't you know what a full house is?

Yeah.
And I also know what a psych-out is.

I love this boy.

And I think we're gonna look back on
this as a new beginning for our marriage.

A rebirth. A renaissance, if you will.

Alan, I think I'm gay.

All right.

We'll make a list.

On one side, we'll put gay stuff...

I'll see you

and raise you $20.

- I think he's got you, pal.
- He's bluffing.

He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.

How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in?

Take him down.

Call you.

I hate this kid.

What the hell is going on here?

You said "hell. "

- Throw $1 in the pot.
- What?

Hey, we all had to.

Charlie, may I speak with you
privately, please?

- Whose deal is it?
- Jake, go to bed!

I'm out.

What is wrong with you? Are you insane?

Do you have any sense
of right and wrong?

Probably not. How was dinner?

How could you put Jake in a poker game
with grown men?

I obviously can't be trusted.

So, how was dinner?

I leave you alone with him
for a couple of hours...

I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.

Dinner was swell. We both had
the veal piccata and she's gay!

Wow.

Most chicks won't eat veal.

Why do I even try talking to you?

Come on, I'm just trying to get you
to lighten up a little.

I don't need to lighten up.
The world I live in is dark.

Dark and rainy.

And you're useless in it!

Really? I wasn't useless
when you needed a place to stay.

Obviously that was a mistake.

Are you sure?

Maybe we should make a list.

Uncle Charlie?

What's going on? Can't sleep?

No.

My dad says we're moving
to Grandma's tomorrow.

Yeah, that'd keep me up.

If it makes you feel any better,
you won $80 on that last hand.

$85.

$80. The house gets a cut.

I wish my dad was as cool as you.

Don't sell your dad short.

He loves you
more than anything in the world.

You know that, don't you?

I guess.

How come you don't have any kids?

I don't know.

Maybe because I love me
more than anything in the world.

- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

I don't want to go to Grandma's.
I'd rather stay here.

Yeah, well, your dad knows
what's best for you.

Okay. Good night, Uncle Charlie.
I love you.

Yeah. Okay.

You got to love a kid like that.

I even played him Stairway to Heaven

and he still liked
the Maple Loops song better.

Charlie,
I haven't seen you in two weeks.

You finally got the house
back to yourself.

Now, do you want to talk about
your nephew, or do you want to have sex?

Sex. Definitely sex.

- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

Do you ever think about having kids?

Whoa, we've got a good thing going.
Can't we just leave it at that?

What are you doing?
I thought we were gonna have sex.

How am I supposed to have sex while
your biological clock is going off?

Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

Hi, Monkey Man.

I was just thinking about you

and wondering why we hurt each other
so much.

Rose, it's me, Monkey Man.

- Charlie?
- Yeah, listen, let me ask you a question.

Is there something
inherently wrong with

asking a woman you're involved with
if she wants kids?

Charlie, we got a good thing going,
why do you want to mess it up?

Look at you.
All grown up and back living with Mom.

How good do you feel about yourself
right now?

On a scale of one to two.

I'm not back living with Mom.

I'm simply staying here
till Judith and I work things out.

So, one?

What do you want, Charlie?

I figured you've been here
a couple of weeks,

you got to have blood
in your stool by now.

So, I thought if you and Jake wanted
to come back to my place for a while,

- that'd be okay.
- Wait a minute.

Are you saying you want me
to come back and live with you?

Well, truthfully, no.

I want Jake to come back
and live with me,

but I figure you're a package deal.

Thanks, but we're doing just fine
here with Mom.

Come on. We can't let Jake be exposed
to her on any kind of ongoing basis.

There's no ongoing basis.
He's only here on weekends.

That's too much.

Piranhas can strip an entire cow
in an hour.

Alan, we've got to get him away from her.
I mean, look what happened to us.

And what happened to you?

Hi, Mom.

Charlie, you're a grown man.

Perhaps it's time to stop blaming
your mother for your own shortcomings.

Alan, the divan is not for sitting.

Charlie, get off the couch.

Uncle Charlie.

There's my good boy.

And what did I tell you
about yelling in the house?

Grandma, I'm suffocating.

Sound familiar?

You're right, this madness must end.

Here, I got you your own key.

I am not comfortable with this.
I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.

You're not waiting in the car.

Trust me, this is a great way
to meet women.

I don't want to meet women.
I'm still married.

Come on, your wife's out meeting chicks,
why shouldn't you?

It's got oats and corn and wheat
It's the sweetest breakfast treat

It's maple maple maple-licious

Your son is just adorable.

- Thank you.
- You and your

life partner must be so proud.

You're right. Go wait in the car.

.......... ********** ..........

Let's see, what else?

Okay. Here's one of the first things
your uncle Charlie wrote.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

What do you think?

Must have been before my time.

Okay, we're done here.

Don't put your juice box on the piano,
it leaves a ring.

How could a box leave a ring?

Got to run to the grocery store.

I'm gonna need somebody
to fold these clothes.

I don't know if the grocery store

is the first place I'd go for that,
but good luck.

Remember, you're being punished.
So, no TV, no computer, no GameBoy.

I need you to be my eyes and ears.

Okay, but you have to be
my liver and prostate.

Whoa, whose is this?

Charlie, you want to field that one?

No problem. Jake, sometimes when you
have a casual sexual relationship...

All right!

Jake, we take in strangers' laundry
because we're poor.

I'll be back in an hour.
Start folding. No TV.

What'd you get busted for?

I painted my room at Mom's house.

- What's wrong with that?
- I'm 10 years old.

- How about a little sock golf?
- What's that?

Okay, here's how it works.

The living room is a dogleg par four.

That means you have to get your sock
into the kitchen sink

- in four strokes or less.
- Okay.

We'll play for a quarter a hole.

Your handicap's obvious.

You're short, and you've never
heard of the Ninja Turtles.

All right, keep your knees bent.

Your arm straight and swing easy.

Oh, man, I'm being hustled.

- We can play for less if you want.
- Don't get cocky.

There's 17 more holes.

The 18th hole, all square.

The defending champion looks
to have an easy tap-in for a birdie

as the gallery waits breathlessly
for the rookie to respond.

Would you please stop talking?

Tempers flare as the pressure mounts.

- Yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

An eagle on the 18th.

This has never happened before
in the history of sock golf!

A little help here?

Fans are coming out of the gallery
with sacks of groceries

- for the young phenom.
- What's going on?

I won. I beat Uncle Charlie.

Excuse me, didn't I ask you
to fold the laundry?

Laundry? Are you barking mad?

The child just won the coveted
Palmolive Cup.

I won. You lose.

When I ask Jake to do something,

I need you to help me
make sure he does it.

I'm trying to teach him responsibility.

This sock is soaking wet.

Yeah, I chipped into the water hazard
on the ninth and the lid was open.

- So, this is toilet water?
- At least.

All right.
I put Jake to bed, I folded the laundry,

I put the groceries away...

The guilt thing doesn't work on me,
Alan.

Yeah, well, it's all I got.
I'll be back in a little while.

- Where you going?
- I have to bring the garbage cans back in.

Today wasn't garbage day.

- No, not here. At Judith's.
- At Judith's?

Alan, your wife threw you out.

Yeah, that doesn't mean
she doesn't need me.

Yeah, it kind of does.

Look, we're still married,
it's still my house,

and she still counts on me
to do a few chores.

It's good. It leaves the door open for,
you know, reconciliation.

I see.

So, how do you lift those garbage cans
without a spine?

They're on wheels.

What are you watching?

I'm watching a movie,

and you're not supposed
to be watching anything.

Oh, yeah.

- Is that guy a good guy or a bad guy?
- Good guy.

And you're not supposed
to be watching TV.

I know.

- Is that his girlfriend?
- Ex-girlfriend.

But he still loves her, right?

I'm not going to walk you
through the whole movie.

I think so.

- Go to bed, Jake.
- Okay.

Who's that guy?

That's the guy he was in jail with

and told him
where the money was hidden.

Right.

- You're being punished. No TV.
- I know.

What the hell is going on?

- Jake?
- Goodnight.

Hey, I'm watching that.

What part of "no TV"
didn't you understand?

I'm allowed to watch TV.

I mean Jake.

I said, "No TV." He said, "Okay. "
I said, "Go to bed. " He said, "Okay. "

- What'd you want from me?
- He's taking advantage of you

because he knows
you won't follow through.

He obviously knows me
better than you do.

If this is gonna work out
with Jake living here part-time,

you have to be an adult.
You have to impose discipline.

Yeah, fine, whatever.
Give me back the remote.

No. You're not listening to me.
You need to be firm.

Okay.

- Go to your room.
- Yes, like that.

I mean it. Give me the remote
and go to your room.

That's very funny.

I'm serious. Get out of here,
or I will kick your ass.

Oh, man.

Shoo.

Jake.
Jake!

It was on when I came in.

Yeah, right.

What did I tell you about leaving
juice boxes on my piano?

How do you know it's mine?

Come on, who else around here drinks
"Transylvania Goofy Juice"?

Good point.

And another thing. Were you on the deck
feeding the seagulls again?

Sorry, I forgot.

Okay. We need to talk.

Love you, Uncle Charlie.

Look, we don't feed the seagulls
because you can't get rid of them.

We don't leave
the doors and windows open,

because we get all kinds of bugs
and crap flying in the house.

- Okay.
- No. Don't just say "okay. "

This is not the grownup
telling the kid what to do.

This is just two guys agreeing
how to live together.

- Are we cool?
- Yeah. Cool.

- What's going on?
- Nothing.

- Was he watching TV?
- No.

Jake, I have to run a quick errand.

Why don't you wash and dress?
When I get back, we'll do something fun.

- Can we watch TV?
- Go.

Where are you off to?

The grocery store.

- You're going to Judith's, aren't you?
- No.

Then where are you going?

Judith's.

- Alan.
- I have to.

The timer on the sprinkler system
is broken,

and the flower beds are getting flooded,
and I love her and I want her back.

Buddy, I feel for you.

- Thank you.
- Unfortunately, the feeling is nausea.

Great. I'll see you later.

Alan, you've been making
the same mistake your whole life.

Being the good boy, fixing everything
so everybody would love you.

It didn't work with Mom.

It didn't work with either of the women
you went out with.

And it's not gonna work with your wife.

You know nothing about commitment
and responsibility to a relationship.

Granted. But I do know
when a woman's using me.

And by that I mean not in a fun way.

Well, you can rest easy,
because no one is using me.

And did you mean that I only dated
two women including Judith?

Because if you did,
I have two words for you.

Maxine Chernakoff.

- Did you fix it?
- Not quite.

It doesn't seem like
you're changing anything.

No? Well, sometimes change happens,
Judith, and you can't see it.

Okay. Fine.
When you're done fixing this,

would you come and take a look
at the garbage disposal?

- Sure.
- Thank you.

Wait, no.

What?

No, I won't come inside
and look at the garbage disposal.

Why not?

I know when I'm being used, Judith,
and not in a fun way.

What are you talking about?

Who are we kidding?
The marriage is over.

You're just afraid to move on,
so, you keep dragging me over here,

and I'm afraid to move on,
so I keep coming.

Goodbye, Judith. You're free.

I hope you find
whatever it is you're looking for.

- What you got there?
- Just a little bread.

Please tell me you're not feeding
the seagulls again.

Okay.

Man, did you let another one of those
big flappy bastards in the house?

You have to put $1 in the swear jar,
you said "bastards. "

Smart, poke the bear.

I'm telling you, Jake,
this is the last...

Yikes!

I'm really sorry, Uncle Charlie.

I don't want to talk to you right now.

Hello, do you have a department
of animal control or bird abatement?

I have a seagull problem.

Seagull.

Thank you, I'll hold.

I didn't know there'd be so many.

I told you, don't feed the damn things.
I told you, don't leave the windows open.

Yeah, hi, who's this?

Phyllis Siegal.

No, Phyllis, I wanted to talk to
somebody about seagulls.

I got a flock of seagulls in my house.

No, I don't know
whatever happened to them.

I'm really sorry.

We had an agreement, Jake,
and you broke it.

Look, I need somebody who can come over
with a net or something.

Sure, I'll hold.

Hello? Who's this?

Annette.

Look, I got a room
filled with seagulls and... No.

Hi, Phyllis.

Goodbye, Phyllis.

Good news.

Really? Come tell me in Jake's room.

What did he do?
He didn't paint anything, did he?

I want you to be surprised.

You will never guess what happened
while I was at Judith's.

Neither will you.

Oh, my God!

So, what's your good news?

Open the door!

Your kid got them in there,
you get them out.

Open the door!

That was not funny, Charlie.

Depends on what side of the door
you were on.

Look, I'm really sorry about the birds,

but I'm sure they'll leave
as soon as they get hungry.

That's what I thought about you.

You know what? Jake and I may be
out of here sooner than you think.

- What do you mean?
- At Judith's, there was kissing.

Mutual kissing. Unprompted,
but reciprocated by yours truly.

Wow.

And was it as boring as it sounds?

Charlie, she kissed me.

This wasn't the kiss of a woman who just
wanted her garbage disposal unclogged.

Well, you know her plumbing
better than I do.

You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna let her come to me.

You know, be detached,
play it cool. You know?

Yeah. That's your home-run swing.

Hey, Uncle Charlie,
you want to play some sock golf?

- No, thanks.
- Where are you going?

I'm going for a drive.

- Can I come?
- Nope.

I don't think
Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.

Don't be silly. He's just a little
upset about the 30, 40

screaming, crapping birds in his house.

Why don't you write him a note
and tell him how sorry you are?

Okay.

Don't worry, he'll come around.

Sooner or later, everybody comes around.

You just have to give them a little time
and a little space.

Hello, Judith?

- What's in the bucket?
- Chum.

- What?
- Bait.

I went down to the bait shop and
asked them what seagulls like to eat.

We're keeping them?

No. We're gonna throw the bait
out the window

to lure the birds out of the house.

That's pretty clever.

Yeah, it's a variation on something I do
with women and tennis bracelets.

Hey, Uncle Charlie, I made this for you.

Thanks.

I made it myself.

I see that.

- What are you doing?
- I'm getting rid of the birds.

- Can I help?
- Nope.

Jake, why don't you go out
and play on the deck, okay?

Okay.

What is wrong with you?

He worked really hard on that card.
You barely looked at it.

- What do you want from me?
- He's dying for you to forgive him.

Fine. I forgive him.

Now, are you gonna help me or not?
I got a serious problem here.

Really? Because you look like
you have it all together.

Okay, here's the deal.

We go in there and start throwing
this stuff out the windows.

When the last bird's out,

we close the window
and get on with our lives.

You're ready?

Sure.

You know, if they love this bait so much,
why would they even wait for...

It's almost like somebody tipped
them off.

- You got any other bright ideas?
- Yeah.

I'm gonna get a drywall guy in there
and seal off that room.

- Very funny.
- I'm not kidding.

That room is dead to me.

Either that or sell the house.

I'll put it on the market
as a two bedroom plus aviary.

Everybody loves an aviary.

What about Jake?

Are you gonna put him on the market
or just wall him off?

I tried with that kid, Alan.

He says one thing,
and then he goes and does another.

He's 10. He's got the attention span
of a hummingbird.

What am I supposed to do
when he ignores me?

You punish him. You take away
his computer, his TV, his toys.

You already took away
all the good stuff.

What am I supposed to take away?
His bronchial inhaler?

You know what I'm saying, Charlie.
You don't take away your love.

Hi. I tried calling
but I kept getting your machine,

- so I thought I'd bring this over.
- What is it?

It's my master file of handymen, plumbers,
electricians, maintenance schedules,

warranties, authorized repair centers,

et cetera.

Okay, well, you're on your own.
Got to run.

Alan, wait.

- Yes?
- About that kiss?

When you said we should move on,
I got scared, and...

Alan, I kissed you out of fear.

Hey, it still counts.

Alan, you were right.
We have to move on.

Okay.

Alan, wait.

Yes?

The garbage disposal's still making
that horrible noise.

I keep telling you not to
put bones in it.

- I didn't.
- The sink trap does not lie, Judith.

This is so cool, Uncle Charlie.

Yeah, I was kind of hard on you,
and I wanted to make it up.

So, you're not still mad
about the seagulls?

I'm still mad. I just figured out
a better way to deal with it.

Well, I think this is a very good way.

Me, too.

I'm buying you all this stuff,

but as punishment for letting seagulls
in my house,

you can't play with it for a month.

A month?

Pretty smart, huh?

It's not fair.

You know what this is?

The world's smallest violin.

What are you talking about?

They're gone, Charlie.

Are you sure? Check under the bed.

All clear.

Okay.

I wonder why they left.

Maybe because we stopped feeding them.

Whoa, check it out.

Wow.

- You know what this means, don't you?
- Yeah.

Breakfast.

.......... ********** ..........

If you've got bugs

If you've got ants

If you've got bugs and flies and
slugs and things that crawl

We're here!

- Mom, come see my room!
- I'll be right there, honey!

- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Hi, shorty!

Hello, Charlie.

Hi, Judith. What're you doing here?

If you must know, I'm here to help
Jake set up his room,

so he feels like nothing's changed.

Really? You don't think he'll notice
his dad's living here

and his mom's dating chicks?

Could you say that a little louder?
Jake might not have heard you.

Just for the record, I'm not
dating anyone,

and I threw your brother out 'cause
he was sucking the life out of me.

Could you say that a little louder?

Uncle Charlie hasn't met Porky yet!

I don't suppose that's a
Rubenesque 19-year-old girl.

Porky's his pet guinea pig.

You're bringing vermin into my house?

Uncle Charlie, check him out!
Isn't he awesome?

Yeah.

See those little black things?
That's his poop.

Awesome.

I don't want him in the water this
weekend. He might have an ear infection.

Oh, Mom.

No, it's okay, pal.
We can go to Disneyland.

We'll have a great weekend.

We can play miniature golf, go bowling,
bike riding, whatever you want.

Alan, relax, you're starting to
sound like a tampon commercial.

Jake, why don't you go put Porky
in your room?

Okay.

Alan, I'm very concerned.
He's just a child.

I don't know if he
can deal with this.

Give your son some credit.
He's an incredible kid.

I was talking about you.

- That's fair.
- Yeah.

Charlie? That strange lady
from down the beach is back.

Yeah, she's here to baby-sit.

Come again?

I thought we'd go out and have a drink.

You want me to leave my son with the
whack job who's been stalking you

since your one night stand?

You try and find a
baby-sitter on a Friday night.

It's okay, Alan.
Charlie and I talked and I understand

that we're just friends,
and that it is not okay for me

to sneak into his house
and lick all his silverware.

As reassuring as that sounds,
we can't go out tonight.

We're getting up early to
go to Disneyland.

We?

Yeah. I thought that maybe
you'd want to come with us.

Alan, I'm not thrilled about having one
small rodent in my house.

Why would I drive fifty miles
to see their kingdom?

I'll go!

Maybe some other time, Rose. It turns out
we're not gonna need a babysitter tonight.

No problem.
I'm gonna take this seat cushion, okay?

Knock yourself out.

Why does she want your seat cushion?

I don't know why she brought it,
I don't know why she's taking it.

Okay, then, I'll see you later.

Wait, you're still going out?

Yeah. Why?

I thought you wanted us
to spend some time together.

Here?

Okay.

What're you thinking? 10, 15 minutes?

- Go.
- Thanks.

Good morning, Uncle Charlie.

Morning, Porky.

Did you have sweet dreams?

Jake, rule number one.
Uncle Charlie does not like

to start his day with a
squealing creature in his face.

Sorry. Grandma's here.
She wants you to come down.

Okay, you're not listening.

Rule number one...

This is a list of the top divorce
attorneys in Los Angeles.

I've made appointments for you
with each of them.

I don't need to meet any attorneys.
I'm not getting a divorce.

I'm sure you don't think so.

The point is, if you consult with all

the good lawyers, it's a conflict of
interest for them to represent Judith.

She'll be stuck with some ambulance-
chasing clown from Van Nuys

who will fold like an origami swan.

I don't want this to be...

Mommy busted her hump on this, Alan.

Thank you?

Morning.

Is that all you have to say
for yourself?

You haven't returned any
of my calls this week.

It's all I can do to not imagine you
lying dead in a ditch somewhere.

Right back at ya, Mom.

What did you want to talk about?

Too late. I'm not speaking to you.

- All right.
- Would you like to know why?

No, I trust your judgment.

Because when your
brother's marriage ended,

yes, I know, Alan, blah, blah, blah,

and he chose to move in here, your
coldness towards your mother

became more than just the behavior
of an ungrateful son.

It's now an obstacle to my spending
quality time with my beloved grandchild.

Are you coming to Disneyland with us,
Grandma?

Darling, Grandma doesn't do Anaheim.

We'd better hit the road. Try to beat
the traffic. Thanks for dropping by, Mom.

Let's go, Jake.
I'll race you to the car.

- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- Bye.

Wait for me, I'm going!

Come on, boy. Heel. Stay. Now, stay.

Who's a good dog? Oh, yeah!

Hey, Jake, you want to take him?

Whatever. Come on, leash.

Get ready for bed.
I'll be right in to tuck you in.

Happiest place on earth,
my snow white ass.

I had a good time.

Oh, really?
Which part did you like best?

The equatorial heat, the endless
lines, or the large German woman that

threw up on me in the Teacup?

Maybe things could have gone smoother,
but tomorrow's gonna make up for it.

Alan, you could get us all laid
tomorrow, it's not gonna make up for it.

Hey, sleepy head. You're just in time.
Your pancakes are almost ready.

I'm not hungry.

Not hungry?
Come on, you've gotta fuel up that engine.

- We've got a big day planned.
- My ear hurts.

Oh, no.

Let me feel. Yeah, you're a little warm.

Probably another ear infection.

Okay, new plan.

We'll get you on the antibiotics,
we'll watch a little TV,

play some video games.
We'll have a great day.

I want to go home.

You are home.

I know, but the real one, with Mom.

Okay, I understand that.
You know, when a guy's feeling sick,

he needs his mom. Right, Charlie?

Well,

I may not be the one to ask.

Okay, I'll, call your mom and,
tell her we're on our way.

All right, it's just you and me now.
Are you really sick, or are you just

fakin' it to get out of another
fun-filled afternoon?

I'm really sick.

Just checking.
Because I was gonna fake it.

If your home is bug infested
filled with spiders, flies or gnats

All our sprays are safety tested
we kill vermin, not your cats

Hey. How's the jingle coming?

The lyrics are fine,
the music needs a little work.

How's Jake?

He'll be okay.
I stayed over at the house a little while.

We watched some movies,
I made us some soup and a couple of

sandwiches,
and Judith suggested I take mine to go.

Suggested?

She started my car and threw my
sandwich in the back seat.

That's rough.

Listen, I'm afraid I got some more
bad news for you.

No, gosh, I forgot to bring Porky back.

See, that's the thing.
Nothing's bringing Porky back.

What? Porky's dead?

"Buh-dee, buh-dee, buh-dee,
that's all folks! "

Oh, God.

It's okay.
We can get Jake another guinea pig.

Jake will be fine.
This is his fourth Porky in three years.

He goes through them faster than shoes.

No, this is about my life.

Everything is going to hell.

Okay, well, don't cry.
We can still be friends.

What?

I'm sorry. It's the only thing I know to
say when someone cries around here.

I am so sorry, Porky.

You just kept running around
in your little cage,

trying to make everybody
happy. And what do you get?

You get dead.

You do know the pig can't hear you,
right?

Don't you get it? I am the pig!

Okay. I'm just asking, because your
reaction doesn't seem very healthy to me.

And what do you think would be healthy,
Charlie?

I don't know. Why don't we toss Porky
in the ocean and go get bombed?

How could you?

Okay.

Toss him in the ocean. Very clever.

Who knew pelicans eat guinea pigs?

What's happening?

Sunday's Tequila Night at Pavlov's.

Every time the bell rings,
you gotta take a shot.

Why?

'Cause the bell rings.

Okay.

You gotta bark first.

Charlie,

when my son looked at me and told me
that he wanted to go "home",

that broke my heart.

I saw.

You know, my kid is sick,
and I can't even be with him.

You know, I'm a failure, Charlie.
I'm a failure as a father,

I'm a failure as a husband.

You didn't fail.
First of all, that little boy loves you.

Second of all, just because your wife
decides she doesn't like

sleeping with men, doesn't mean
you've failed as a husband.

Although, I wouldn't brag about it.

You're right. This is Judith's fault.

She's the one who breached our
marriage contract asunder.

And I let her make decisions that
should have been in my dominion.

Alan, people are gonna do whatever
they're gonna do in this world.

The only thing a man can control
is his own actions.

I don't remember where we left our car.

This isn't our car?

Where to?

Home.

- And that would be?
- Sherman Oaks.

We don't live in Sherman Oaks.

I do. I am a Sherman Oaksian and I am

going home for as to reclaim my home.

That's a very bad idea.
I'll tell you what's a good idea.

Chili cheese fries and a large root
beer. With chili cheese fries.

And girls.

No. I am going home to my wife

to impose my dominion over her.

Yeah. The lesbians love that.

Driver! Sherman Oaks!

1167, Bonnie Meadow Drive.

Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll be back for my things tomorrow.

Thank you, driver.
You've been most kind.

So, back to Malibu?

No. Let's give it a second.

Did you know they put
chocolate pudding in tubes now?

No, I did not.

They do. My nephew eats them.

They're surprisingly good.

You know, that's an interesting
sibling dynamic

you've got goin' with your
brother there.

You get that I'm loaded, right?

Drive!

So? How'd it go?

She chased me out of the house
with a golf club.

Taking up golf already.

What was it like, a six iron?

What difference does it make?

I just want to be able to
tell the story accurately.

It's not funny.

Then why are you laughing?

Because I don't know what else to do.

I wish I could ask Dad for advice.

You'd go to Dad for marriage counseling?

Alan, our father committed suicide
to get away from our mother.

What're you talking about? Dad didn't
commit suicide. He died of food poisoning.

I maintain that he knew the fish was
bad, but he kept eating it anyway.

Your mother sounds like
a real piece of work.

You have no idea, my friend.

My mother took my baby brother
and dipped him in sissy sauce

and turned him into the people-pleasing
control freak you see today.

That's right!
And she made him so scared of intimacy

that he has just this
endless stream of gorgeous girls

running in and out of his life.

Damn her.

You know, many psychologists agree,
until the core maternal relationship

is resolved, most men are doomed to
repeat dysfunctional childhood patterns.

Just drive the cab, Doctor Phil.

You know what, Charlie? He's not wrong.

At some point,
we have to stand up to her.

Look who's got beer muscles
all of a sudden.

No, I'm serious. Come on. Right now.

Let's confront her.
You with me? Come on!

Oh, my God.

I can't believe it!
You really are afraid of Mom!

I am not.

All these years,
I thought you were so cool.

But you're just a big clucking chicken!

Ouch.

Ouch?

Okay, that's it.
We have a new destination.

Beverly Hills.

You got an address?

Just go east on Sunset until
you reach the Gates of Hell.

She'll buzz us in.

I can't wait to see her face.

She's gonna freak.

You ready?

Ring the bell.

Who is it?

It's your sons!

Charlie and Alan.

Hi, Mom.

Dear God. Hold on. I'll be right there.

Okay, what exactly are we
gonna say to her?

Now you ask? This was your safari.

We're here to resolve the core
maternal thing.

Wait, I'll go ask the cabbie.

Nice try.

Somebody better be dead.

Porky's dead.

And you completely screwed up our lives.

I'm sorry?

- That's good enough for me.
- Yeah, I'm good.

Driver, drive!

Good morning, sunshine.

God. Close the drapes.

Hey, what's this?
"Release and indemnification form. "

What?

Were you on some kind of
television show last night?

I don't think so.

You and your brother signed it.

Let me see that.

Alan.

Alan, wake up.

We got a problem.

"Taxicab Confessions?"

If you've got bugs

If you've got ants

If you've got bugs and flies and
slugs and things that crawl

Ain't that Beethoven?

I don't even know how my wife
is gonna be a lesbian.

She hates oral sex.

Hates it!

.......... ********** ..........

Charlie? Honey, wake up.

- Good morning.
- You lied to me, Charlie.

You said it was
just going to be the two of us.

I didn't lie, Berta. Things change.

Goodbye, Charlie.

Don't leave me, Berta.

I love you.

- Can't we talk about this?
- Sorry. I do single men only.

I'm in, I'm out,
there are no complications.

But I am single.

Berta? I hate to bring this up again,
but you just...

You cannot put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator. It gets hard.

And, on a related subject,
the peanut-butter stains

on Jake's shirts
really require an enzyme presoak.

I hope you two will be
very happy together.

But who's going to take care of me?

Who's going to do the laundry,
the shopping,

- and the cleaning and all the other stuff?
- Ask the Scrubbing Bubble there.

Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving?

Why? It doesn't matter, Jake.

What matters is she's gone.

And we're all going to die.

She left before she made the coffee.

So? We'll make our own coffee.

How?

So, now we just wait?

Yes. It takes a couple of minutes.

Alan, this goes beyond coffee.

Berta's been with me forever.
She does everything.

She's like a wife that leaves
before you wake up,

and doesn't mind if you sleep around.

Is that the coffee?

It's my peanut butter. I made it soft.

I've been figuring out a way to repay you
for letting me and Jake stay here.

- Why don't I take over the housework?
- Berta did the shopping, too.

- I can do that.
- She did my laundry.

In her way, yes.

But I can handle that, too. And look,

I even made your coffee.

Thank you.

No.

Not as good as Berta's.

It's her coffee.
I just pressed the button.

Berta's tasted,
I don't know, Christmassy.

What does that mean, "Christmassy?"

It means "like Christmas. "

Now, you got to work with me, Charlie.

I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon,
powdered reindeer?

I don't know.
It's just that when you drank it,

it felt like Christmas morning,
and anything was possible.

Sweet'N Low? Half & Half? Mocha Mix?

Forget it. I'll just read my paper.

Where's my paper?

I don't know.
You might try looking by the front door.

No, it's usually right here,
on the table.

Okay, so before you got up, Berta started
the coffee and got you your paper?

I don't know the mechanics of it,
but, yeah.

I'll go get it.

He's not off to a very good start.

Want a glass of peanut butter?

- Alan?
- Yeah?

I can see you.

And I can see you, too.

No. I mean, Berta never cleaned
when I was in the room.

She was like invisible.

I'm sorry.
I'll try to be more transparent.

Appreciate it.

Oh, no.

I see you.

Give me a break.

Not you.
That girl that's been stalking me.

Rose?

There you are.

What are you doing
sneaking up on me like that?

Rose, honey,

we spent one night together,
and it was very nice, but...

What is your favorite part?

Gee, I'd have to say, finding out you
live just two doors down.

Sometimes, it's all I can do not to chew
through that house in the middle.

Yeah.

But see, I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

So, maybe you should find someone
who can give you the attention you want.

Need, deserve,

require.

Are you saying we should see
other people?

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

You have so much love to give,
and somewhere out there is a guy who

can take it.

- Well, there is this one guy...
- He sounds perfect.

His name is Andy.
He works at Jamba Juice.

He always gives me a free wheatgrass
shooter and chuckles when I gag.

Then ask him out.

That seems kind of forward,
don't you think?

No, come on,
women ask guys out all the time.

What they don't do
is handcuff themselves

to the refrigerator,
when he says it's time to go home.

That's where you and I
went off the track, isn't it?

I'm the past. Andy's the future.

Bye-bye now. Good luck,

Andy.

Alan?

- What did you do to my piano?
- Nothing. I just dusted.

Yes, well, I'm sitting here trying
to write a jingle about a chocolate bar

and my piano smells like lemons.

Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie.
But they don't make chocolate Pledge.

Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

The rest of the house can smell like
any fruit you want.

But my piano needs to smell...

- Piano-y.
- There you go.

Fine. I'll get an unscented polish.

That's not going to help me now, is it?

Nope.

You know what? You are a child.
You're a big, high-maintenance child.

I am not a child.

Where you going?

If I can't write my chocolate song,
I'm going to take a nap.

Charlie, you asleep?

I'm doing a load of whites.

Jeez!

- Charlie?
- What?

You kicked me in your sleep.

Who said I was asleep?

I can't do this anymore.
You are impossible.

Don't blame me. I tried to make it work.

Excuse me? Berta quit at 9:00.

It's now 2:30. When did you try?
Where was the trying?

You're the one who made Berta quit.

I didn't make her quit.

I simply raised the bar
of quality housework

and she insisted on limboing under it.

But since you obviously
can't live without her,

you big baby,
I will go apologize and get her back.

- Great.
- So, where does she live?

I don't know.

Okay. What's her last name?

Your entire life depends on this woman
and you know nothing about her.

Wait.

She took a bus.

I stand corrected.

After she works here in the morning,
she cleans some rock star's house.

Okay, what rock star? Where?

Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
4456 Malibu Canyon Road.

Thank you.

Now listen, Judith is coming by at 5:00 to
pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.

Now I should be back by then.

But you need to make sure
he's dressed and ready to go.

- No problem.
- No, it's a problem, Charlie.

I'm trying desperately
to reconcile with my wife,

so I don't want to tick her off.

So, you telling me, "It's no problem,"
does not reassure me.

Here. Take my sock.
I want to show you a trick.

I'll go get Berta.
You make sure Jake is ready.

- Hi.
- Hello.

There are security cameras out front,
so come up from the back,

and bring some dog treats,
in case the rottweilers are out.

Again, thank you.

I asked Andy out, and he said yes.

- Andy?
- That guy you told me to ask out.

I just don't know what to wear.

I love this one,
but it still smells like pepper spray.

Where are you going?

To roll around naked on your bed.

I'm just kidding.
I'm going to try on the dress, silly.

But...

- Is that lady your girlfriend?
- No, she's just...

It's complicated.

- What the hell happened to you?
- You know what else is complicated?

Fractions.

You got grease all over you.

It's in your hair, man.

Yes. My bike chain broke.
Can you fix it?

Kid, I'm a piano player.
What do you think?

Look, your mom's going to be here soon
to take you to dinner.

I know.

- So, how about a shower?
- No, thank you.

That wasn't a question.

Sorry, pal, but you need a shower.

But my bike's still broken.
I think you made it worse.

What are you talking about?
Now you got a unicycle.

Get in the shower.

- I'm so worried he's not going to like me.
- He's going to love you, Rose.

Just go out, have a great time,
and don't come on too strong.

Me, too strong? What do you mean?

Okay, speaking from my own experience,

there's nothing wrong with asking a guy
for a blood test,

but trying to take the blood yourself
is a little strong.

- I see.
- Where you going now?

You got me thinking
this dress comes on too strong.

So, I'm going to put on something
a little less...

And a little more...

Jake, why aren't you in the shower?

Oh, yeah.

Hi, Berta.
It's me, the Scrubbing Bubble.

I came to apologize.

Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

Come on, can't we put aside
our petty differences

and find a way to work together
out of a mutual love for Charlie?

Yeah, that's why I do this. For love.

The thing is, I'm going through
a really tough time right now.

My marriage is collapsing,
my business is slow.

My little boy is being dragged
back and forth

from his mother's house to Malibu.

My alcoholic husband ran off
with my daughter's parole officer,

and I clean rich peoples'
toilets for a living.

Okay, let's not make this a competition.

Jake, you've been in there for a while.
How's it going?

Good.

What are you doing?

Washing my bike chain. It's real dirty.

Forget about the chain.

You got to take a shower
before your mother gets here.

We're going to need a new chain.

Hello, Charlie's house. May I help you?

Hi, Alan, it's Rose. I got in.
How'd you do?

Here he is.

- It's your brother.
- Thank you.

How's it going? Did you talk to Berta?

Yes, I'm here with her now.

- Is Jake ready?
- Yes.

We're just applying the
finishing touches.

- What about Berta?
- The same. Finishing touches.

She's really a delight.

Just make sure Jake is ready
when Judith gets there.

Relax. Everything's under control.
I got to go.

- So, you like this dress better?
- Hang on, Rose.

The kid's running around the deck
in his underwear.

Sure. But when I do it,
you just ignore me.

- Jake, what are you doing?
- Air drying.

You still have grease in your hair.
Didn't you wash it?

You didn't say to wash my hair.

- Wash your hair.
- Okay.

You didn't tell him to rinse.

Good, that's good. Thank you.

Jake, rinse!

All right, so you won't come back.

Will you at least tell me how you made
the damn coffee Christmassy?

Christmassy?

Yeah, Charlie said
your coffee tastes Christmassy.

- Cinnamon.
- I said cinnamon.

Lower back? You do a lot of lifting?

Of course you do.
You're a maid, and I'm an ass.

- I'm a housekeeper.
- Of course.

- And you're an ass.
- Yes.

Why don't you sit down,
let me take a look at it?

- What?
- I'm a chiropractor.

Okay. But no funny business.

Not to worry.

Looks like you washed
your hair instead of mine.

I'm not in the mood, Jake.

These clothes look stupid.

You're 10. No one cares.

- You're choking me.
- Trust me.

You'll know when I'm choking you.

I think my socks are on the wrong feet.

Jake, dude, I'm right on the edge.

Don't push me.

I can't do this on someone else.

- Charlie?
- You look great, Rose.

I don't think I can go
through with this.

What? No. Sure you can.

- No, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.
- No, you're not. Now listen to me.

You're a wonderful woman. And this guy,
Andy, is going to love you.

Thanks, but you're saying that
just to get me out of your hair.

No, not just.

- Now go out and have a great time.
- But...

No goodbyes.
Just turn around and walk away.

Okay.

Goodbye.

Goodbye, Rose.

- What happened?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

Why did you take your clothes off?

Sometimes, I miss.

Okay. That's it. I give up.

You are a child, Jake.

Dress, don't dress. Wash, don't wash.

I don't care. You're on your own.

What?

God, that feels so good.

Berta, I can't find my...

Berta, if you're going to do a guy
in the laundry room,

put a scarf on the doorknob
or something.

I'm a big fan.

Is Jake ready?

Where's Jake?

I don't know.

You don't know?
My wife just pulled in behind me.

- You said you'd have him ready.
- It can't be done.

What do you mean, it can't be done?

I'm not strong enough.

His will is greater than mine.

I'm just going to get drunk
and stay out of his way.

Please tell me he's ready.
My parents are driving me nuts.

Well...

Hi, Mom.

Don't you look handsome?

- Uncle Charlie took my tie.
- You don't need a tie.

Grow up, Charlie.

Bye.

- I thought you said he beat you?
- He did.

Now he's just screwing with me.

What happened with Berta?

It wasn't easy, but I did it.

She won't do my laundry,
or get my groceries,

and I have to give her
a lower back adjustment twice a week.

And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.

- But she is coming back?
- Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.

Right on.

Are you crying?

It's been a very emotional day.

Here you go, buddy. Drink your vodka.

You look great, Rose, I swear.

He stood me up.

What? After we spent all day
getting ready?

- I don't know what I did wrong.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

- Then why did he stand me up?
- Because he's an idiot.

He doesn't get
what a truly rare person you are.

Thanks.

I wish Randy could see what you see.

Forget about him. Come on,
I'm going to take you to dinner.

- Really?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

I thought you said his name was Andy.

What did I say?

- You said Randy.
- No, I didn't.

Andy's a real guy. I didn't make him up.

I love your little tie.

.......... ********** ..........

Never mix tequila and scotch.

Morning, Uncle Charlie.

Jake, buddy.

Dad said you'd never get
up to go to soccer with me.

But I said, he promised.
So he was wrong.

What?

You know, most of the parents wear
shorts and lots of sunscreen,

but that's another way to go.

Alan, I can't go to a soccer game.
I just got home from Vegas.

You went out last night
to return a video.

I ran into a friend of mine who was
getting married at the Bellagio.

That explains the tuxedo.

No, I think this was
for something else entirely.

I'm sure I'll read about
it in the paper.

I am the Soccer Snack Buddy this week,
so I've gotta stop at the grocery store.

Why don't you ride to the game
with Jake when the van gets here?

I got a better idea.

Why don't I go upstairs, throw up
and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours?

Fine, but if you're not gonna come,

- you gotta tell Jake yourself.
- Fine. He'll understand.

- Jake?
- I got new cleats.

Nice. Listen, Jake, buddy.

Have you ever been to Vegas?

So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.

I've heard about you.

Everybody out. Watch your heads.
One at a time.

- Party time.
- Come on.

Here's the deal, Uncle Charlie.
I find you attractive.

I have three kids,
a bastard of an ex-husband,

I work 50 hours a week
at my own travel agency,

I'm at the peak of my sexuality,

I have a three-hour window Wednesdays
when the kids are at tae kwon do.

You in or out?

I'm sorry, I'm terminally hung over
and I just took a cleat in the groin.

E- mail me. Allaboardgloria @aol. com.

So, which one's yours?

Please don't make me talk.

This is Charlie Harper.
Alan Harper's brother.

- So, who's winning?
- No one.

We don't keep score. We think it's
healthier if the kids just play for fun.

You're yanking me, right?

Judith warned us that you were a pistol.

By the way, we were so sorry
to hear about her and Alan.

So tell us, is it true?

Did Judith leave your
brother for another woman?

- Why don't you ask Judith?
- We wouldn't want to pry.

Ladies, if you'll excuse me,

I have to go because,
hell, I don't need a reason.

Someone's a little full of himself.

Forget him. His brother's
the one who's in play.

How's Jake doing?

Jake's fine. He's 10.
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

Me, on the other hand,

I'm sitting in the hot sun, in
rented pants listening to myself blink.

I'll ask somebody else.

What?

Sorry. I couldn't help
overhearing, and you just look so

pathetic.

Really? The guy at the
tux shop said I looked dashing.

Of course, that was yesterday.

And I found his phone
number in my pocket.

- What was the occasion?
- Just returning a video.

- Charlie Harper.
- Kate McLaughlin.

Let me ask you something,
Kate McLaughlin.

What's your take on this
whole no-keeping-score thing?

I think it's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

Can I stay here next
to you where it's safe?

Sure.

So, which one's yours?

Number nine. But I'm not the father.

Aren't you a good sport?

Jake, for the last time,

nobody got "creamed. "
No one won, no one lost.

Yeah. Except for us. 12-2.

It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
It's whether or not you beat the spread.

Thank you, Charlie.
Jake, go take a shower.

Charlie, we are trying to teach
the kids not to keep score.

You should've thought of that
before you taught them to count.

By the way, what are you doing
with Jake tomorrow?

I don't know. Why?

I made a play date for him with
one of the kids from the game.

You're hitting on the mother,
aren't you?

Can't slip one past you, can I?

That's not what a play date is for.

What? The kid plays,
I have a date. Everybody wins.

- Everybody wins?
- Yes.

But I promise not to keep score.

Charlie, you cannot use my son
to pick up single mothers.

But I can.

Good night, Snack Buddy.

No going in the water,
no throwing rocks, and remember,

if you can't see us, we can't see you.

Is there anything you'd
like to add, Charlie?

- Why can't they throw rocks?
- Go.

Ernie loves the beach.
Thanks for inviting him.

Anything for the kids.
They're our future.

- So, where's Alan?
- I sent him to the movies.

He deserves a break, and I get
some quality uncle time with Jake.

I think that is really nice of you.

Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes.

I'm sorry, where was I?

You were saying
I was nice about something.

How long have you lived
in Sherman Oaks?

We moved in and...
Ernie, put that down, it's dead.

That kid'll pick up anything,
no matter what it looks like.

Been there.

We moved in just in time
for the earthquake...

Ernie, I am not gonna say it again.

Put the dead thing down.

Jake, you should probably
put your dead thing down, too.

- Kids.
- I know. They're just...

Ernie, put it down
or we're leaving right now.

I'm counting to three. One, two...

Ernie, for God's sake,
you're killing me here.

- Thank you.
- No problem.

- So, did you grow up in L.A.?
- No.

My dad was in the Army
so we moved around...

Hell, that thing's not dead.

I'd like to get to know you,
it's not gonna happen on a play date.

- Ask me out sometime?
- That's a really good...

Are you happy?
I told you to put it down, Ernie.

Get the sand off of it.
No. Don't touch it.

- What night's good for you?
- Jake, you're not helping.

- Don't wait up.
- Back to Vegas?

Even better. Sherman Oaks.

The gateway to Van Nuys.

Kate again?

You have no clue
what you're getting involved in

- with these divorced soccer moms.
- You're right.

I don't have a clue. I've never had
a clue. It's part of my charm.

At least keep in mind that all
these women talk to each other.

So anything you do
will get back to my wife,

and somehow become my fault.

That doesn't seem fair.

So, where are you going?

I'm helping Gloria with
the soccer league newsletter.

I'm thinking of calling it
"Just For Kicks. "

This is the same Gloria
who drives the kid van?

- Yeah. Why?
- Nothing. Have fun.

Talk about not having a clue.

And I designed a logo,

the "K" in "Kicks" is a little foot.

Sounds wonderful.

I can't thank you enough
for taking the time to do this.

Anything for the kids.

You're such a good father.

It's a shame that Judith
didn't appreciate you.

She just needed
a little time to sort things out.

But, yeah. It's a shame.

Look at you.

A successful chiropractor,
intelligent, dedicated.

You're embarrassing me.

I'm sorry.

Let's get back to your little logo.

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

It's my neck. I must have slept wrong.

Make an appointment with my office,
we'll see if we can fix that.

No, I'd feel funny.

We know each other.

Don't be silly. It's what I do.

Turn around. Go ahead.

- Are you getting enough calcium?
- I guess.

It's really important for
a woman your age.

Osteoporosis is a real problem.

Curvature of the spine.

Last thing you want
is to wind up with a hump.

I hope you didn't start without me.

- What are you talking about?
- Bill, you did this on purpose.

You showed up late
so you could snoop on me.

- You got to meet my girlfriend.
- What meet? She was our babysitter.

Will you get out of here, Bill?

Kate, I'm trying.
Ernie, would you put your shoes on?

- Bill.
- Charlie.

That your Jag?

- Yeah.
- It's nice.

I got the Navigator over there.

That's nice, too.

Let's go, Dad.

All right, then.
You try and make her happy.

Truthfully, I think
that my ex was intimidated

by my sexual...

I don't even know, how to say it.
Appetite.

So we're agreed we'll set aside
six inches for the editorial column?

I'm sorry. Yes, six inches.

I don't know how I got so off-topic.

I know exactly how you got off-topic.

I think the next piece of business
is to decide on the paper color.

I brought some samples. We've got

goldenrod, salmon, mustard...

You had me at goldenrod.

Everybody has you at goldenrod.

My brother, Alan, warned me
not to go out with you tonight.

That's funny.

Everybody warned me
not to go out with you.

It worked for Romeo and Juliet,

up until the poison and the stabbing.

Charlie, I have a confession.

I haven't been out with a man other
than my husband in 12 years.

That's not a problem.

A couple of things have changed,
I can bring you up to date.

Please do.

All right, well, nowadays,
women pay for dinner.

And of course, sex is a given.

I'll tell you one thing,
I am not paying for dinner.

Rats.

Look at the time.
Maybe we should get going.

Give Gloria a chance
for a little quiet time before

her many, many kids come home.

I don't need any quiet time.

Don't be silly.

Alan, would you mind driving me home?

I'm feeling a little tipsy.

A little tipsy?
How about a little obvious?

- I'm sorry?
- Could I talk to you for a minute?

- It is getting a little late.
- Sit down.

We'll be right back.

I think she's going through the change.

- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

He's in play. I'm playing.

I'm the one who told you he's in play.

Please. I told you two years ago
that marriage was toast.

So what?

He's in my house
on tae kwon do Wednesday,

and I don't have time to
mess around with you.

Why don't we just let him decide?

Let him decide?

He still thinks we're doing
a soccer newsletter.

- You don't even like him, do you?
- He's okay.

He's here and it's Wednesday.

I happen to think he's hot.

You wouldn't know
what to do with a hot guy.

Yeah? Well, watch me.

Great. You broke him.

The biggest surprise was how
much I loved having him around.

I mean, Jake's amazing.

Do you know I have, on occasion,
actually put his needs ahead of my own?

Like going to a soccer game
at 8:00 am on a Saturday?

Yes.

At 8:00 am, I can barely get out
of bed to go to the bathroom.

What you're saying
is having a child in your life

totally changes the way
you look at things.

Exactly.

Of course, you probably
know that already.

But I like that you know it.

- I had a really great time.
- Me, too.

- Can we do this again?
- I would love that.

Great.

What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

Please don't tell Alan's wife.

No, you didn't do anything wrong.

I really like you.

Okay. This is new for me.

It's just...

Charlie, I have a 10-year-old son.

I have two mortgages,
private school bills,

a full-time job, custody battles,
alimony battles,

child support battles,
car pools and drum lessons.

How can we possibly do this again?

You bought a 10-year-old a drum set?

Don't change the subject.
You know what I'm saying.

Do you really want to be
involved in this?

I hadn't really thought that far ahead.

Exactly.

All right. I guess I'll see you around.

Where are you going?

- Home.
- Why?

I said we couldn't do it again.
That doesn't mean we can't

do it tonight.

Boy, you really don't have a clue,
do you, Charlie?

No.

But it seems to be working for me.

Morning.

Regular or decaf?

- Regular.
- Thank God.

Aren't you even curious?

- You went to Gloria's last night.
- Yeah.

I can fill in the blanks.

We're getting killed.

We're here for fun, right?
Nobody wins or loses.

Come on. Somebody always loses.

Who are we kidding?

It's 8-1 out there, and
everybody here knows it.

And you know,
I'll tell you another thing.

We haven't won a game all season.

And I'll put that in the newsletter.

And as God as my witness,

there will be a newsletter!

Dad, you're kind of freaking
everybody out here.

Forget it, Jake. It's Sherman Oaks.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hi.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

How was your game?

The musician's softball
league is a joke.

Guys trying to catch stuff
that isn't there.

People throwing up on
an easy double play ball.

So why do you go?

There is an open bar,
and they let me pitch.

I've got to get dressed.

I was going to throw this toast out,
but it's yours if you want it.

When did I become the family dog?

- Jake, what's this, a phone message?
- Yeah. Some lady called for you.

Who? I can't read your writing.

"You're a big selfish jerk. "

Okay, I know who this is. Amy.

- Probably Amy.
- Yup, Amy.

- She wants you to call her back.
- Yeah, that'll happen.

- Why not?
- Because I never said I'd call her back.

Remember this, Jake,

never make promises to women
that you don't intend to keep.

- And you know how you do that?
- Always keep my promises?

That might work.

A better way is never make promises.

- What happens if Amy calls again?
- Okay, I'm glad you asked that.

When the phone rings
at Uncle Charlie's house,

we don't just willy-nilly pick up
the receiver and answer it. No.

What we do is we check the caller I.D.,

and only pick up if we want
to talk to that person.

- Like Mom?
- That depends.

Your mom, yes. My mom, no.

How come you don't want
to talk to your mom?

I'll tell you all about that
when you are old enough to drink.

What if I want to talk to your mom?

Okay, that kind of attitude is going
to break down the whole system.

- Dad, no! Don't pick up the phone!
- Why not?

It might be your mom. Or a woman.

It's Amy again. She just won't give up.

Charlie.

Look, I appreciate your need for privacy,
but I think you're sending a bad message

to my son about how to deal with women.

How so?

He thinks it's okay
to avoid somebody because

the conversation might be uncomfortable.

Charlie!

Okay, that's not funny.

Look, if I am teaching
the kid anything, it's honesty.

Really? Walk me through
the lesson, Charlie. Educate me.

Okay. I tell women upfront I'm not
looking for a long-term relationship.

If they don't believe me, or
they're determined to change my mind,

I have a right to avoid that
conversation.

And the phone company obviously
agrees with me,

otherwise they wouldn't have invented
caller I.D.

Uncle Charlie,

what if somebody you don't want to talk
to comes over instead of calls?

- Just tell them I'm not here.
- He's not here, Grandma!

Mom, you just surprised me.

- You should have called first.
- Charlie, I call constantly.

You screen like an Olympic drug tester.

I'm happy to see you, Mom.

I don't believe you, sweetheart.
But at least you care enough to lie.

I care enough to lie.
You just caught me off guard.

So, what are you doing here?

I'm showing a house up the beach, and I
thought, while I am in the neighborhood,

I would drop off a gift for my grandson.

You are writing him a check?

- What kind of gift is that?
- You told me he likes transformer toys.

This check transforms into
any toy he wants.

Thanks, Grandma!

Is that all? Don't I get a hug?

Your grandma loves you so much.

Grandma's got to go to work.

Nobody just gives her checks. Walk me.

In case you are at all interested,
I have been seeing a man. And

he just may be the one.

- Five time's the charm.
- Four.

- But, what about the guy...
- That was annulled.

Boy! Are we going to have a new daddy?

Bite me, Charlie.

I would like to have a dinner
at the house so you boys can meet him.

What night is good for you?

- What night do you want us?
- I asked you first.

Jake's here weekends, it's Thursday.
Check my calendar.

Don't really want to.

Tomorrow night, 7:00.

It's very important to me,
and I hope you can make it.

But I will certainly understand
if you are too busy for your mother.

You know what she is trying to do.

- Of course I know.
- But maybe one of us should go.

- Sure. You go, I look bad.
- What do you care?

- I don't care.
- Then don't go.

- I'm not going.
- I'm not going, either.

- I'm not staying.
- We'll eat, we'll go.

- No coffee, no dessert.
- We can't be rude.

Watch me. I refuse to let that woman...

- Hi, Mom.
- Better late than never.

- We're right on time.
- I was referring to the big picture.

Hi, Grandma.

And look, you brought Jake
to meet my new beau.

Come here, sweetheart. Now, tonight you
and I are going to play a game.

And the name of the game is,

"Don't call me Grandma. "

What kind of game is that?

It's a fun game, honey. It only has
one rule. You have to call me Evelyn.

- Okay.
- Try it.

- Evelyn.
- See? We're having fun already.

Look, you didn't bring wine. Good.
Too many people bring wine.

Tommy, darling, I would like you
to meet my sons.

This is Charlie.

- Charlie.
- Hi, Tommy. How are you?

- Alan.
- Hello.

- And this is Jake.
- Yes, I am, Evelyn.

Let's not beat it to death, okay?

Good to meet you, Jake.

There you are. Boys, this
is Tommy's daughter, Olivia.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi there, stranger.

Do you two know each other?

- I thought I knew him.
- Oh, no.

Okay. Who would like a drink?
I would like a drink.

Charlie, come help me make the drinks.
Alan, talk to Olivia. Alan was a cesarean.

It wasn't medically necessary.
She just had a function to go to.

Is there anyone in the 310 area code
that you have not mounted?

Come on, we went out a couple of times.
She assumed it was an exclusive thing,

and when she found out it wasn't,
she got a little upset.

Anyway, Tommy seems like a real nice
guy. I am very happy for you.

- Goodnight.
- Charles. You are not going anywhere.

This man is very important to me.
We are going to have a nice dinner.

You're going to be charming,
and Tommy will remain oblivious

to the fact that you defiled
his daughter.

She wasn't exactly filed when I met her.

You don't know how lucky you
are to have a mother like Evelyn.

She is the warmest, most affectionate,
giving woman I have ever known.

That's my mom.

Call her Evelyn. That's the game.

You play your game, I'll play mine.

- Here we are.
- There's my little karaoke cupcake.

Tommy, you are not telling that story.

We took one of
those little cruises to Alaska.

Glaciers and whales, I didn't quite
see the point of it all.

But during the evening there
was this karaoke competition.

And as you know,
I'm no stranger to the stage.

Yes Mom, I know.

Excuse me.

Anyway, you know how I
have always sung

These Boots Are Made for Walking,
with my little dance routine.

Yes, Mom. I have it on my wedding video.

- So, how've you been?
- You know...

No, I don't know, Charlie.

When people don't return your calls, it's
kind of hard to know how they have been.

Look, I know this
is an awkward coincidence.

It's no coincidence.

When my father told me who he was
dating, I made a point of being here.

You can't argue the awkward part, right?

So, I am zipping up my boots,
and I am about to go onstage

when this hausfrau from Tone-Deaf, Texas,
gets up and starts singing my song.

I think you can imagine
how unhappy I was.

Don't tell me to calm down.
You lied to me.

I did not lie to you. And you could
have told me this on the phone.

- You never answer your phone.
- Of course not.

Who wants to have this conversation?

So, I sidled up to the woman and

really very smoothly turned
it in to a duet,

when suddenly she starts pushing me.

- You said I was very special to you.
- You were.

- Yeah, me and three other women.
- I said you were special, not unique.

Drop dead, you bastard.

Excuse me!

In my defense...

Screw it!

Finish the story, Evelyn.
Did you push her back?

Stupid musician's league.

I don't know why I bother. Get this.
Tie score, we are down to our last out.

Our best hitter, Billy Kresky's up.

The bases are loaded, and so is Kresky.

His whole family is standing behind
the backstop, crying and pleading,

"Go back to rehab, Daddy, we love you! "

Needless to say, he choked.

Charlie, I think we have got
a bigger problem.

- Our mother is missing.
- Don't try to cheer me up.

I am serious. I called her home,
her car, her cell, nothing.

Did you check with the captain
of the flying monkeys?

Charlie!

She's probably just sulking because I
screwed up her dinner party last week.

That's what I thought, too. Except I called
her office and they haven't heard from her.

- Okay. That's weird.
- Yeah.

I think somebody needs to go over there
and make sure she's okay.

Good idea. You do that
and I'll stay here in case she calls.

Why don't you go
and I will stay here in case she calls?

No, I got to be honest,
I like my idea better.

- I'm not going there alone.
- I'm not going at all.

What do you want to bet she ran off
to Vegas to marry this Tommy guy?

If that's all this is, great.

The only down side would be
that you slept with our stepsister.

Hadn't thought of that. Kinda sexy.

- Kinda sick.
- I'm saying.

Look, there is no one here. Let's go.

No. I want to take a look.

- You have a key?
- I'm the good son.

Mom?

Okay, she's not here. Let's go.

Okay, she's here. Let's go.

Charlie.

Mom, are you all right? Why
haven't you been answering the phone?

I didn't want to burden anyone with
my grief over the late Tommy Pearson.

Tommy died?

He is dead to me.

- Okay, what happened?
- He dumped me.

Mom, I am sorry.

The thing between me and his daughter
happened years before you met the guy.

This has nothing to do with you,
Charlie.

God, you're a narcissist.

No, Tommy left me for some fresh-faced
45-year-old bimbo.

I am sorry, Mom.
I know he meant a lot to you.

Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

Thank you, Alan. Nice try, Charlie.

Now if you will both please leave,
I'd like to be alone.

We understand.

Charlie, wait!
We can't just leave her here.

Fine. Where do you want to leave her?

Mom, why don't you come back and stay
at Charlie's house for a few days?

- How is that?
- Time out.

Don't worry, Charlie. I have no desire
to impose on your life.

Appreciate it. All right then, chin up.

- You sure, Mom?
- Yes. Thank you, Alan.

Okay.

God!

So close.

How long is she going to sit out there?

I don't know.
I've never seen her this depressed.

Somebody's got to go out there
and show her a little love and support.

- Jake!
- Yeah.

Why don't you go out
and talk to Grandma?

- Why?
- Because she's a little lonely.

- She's your mom.
- Don't sass me. Go talk to Grandma.

- Hi, Evelyn.
- Please, sweetheart, call me Grandma.

- But what about the game?
- Games are for children, Jake.

Uncle Charlie got me a metal detector and
sometimes I find cool stuff on the beach.

That's nice.
But you know, that cool stuff

is stuff that other people lost
and will never get back.

Trinkets and treasures buried
beneath the lonely sands of time.

- Yeah, but finders, keepers, right?
- And losers, weepers.

- He's getting killed out there.
- It's all right, he's not crying yet.

Somebody needs to go out there
and back him up.

$10 says it's not me.

What's going on with you...

The kid's got a bladder
the size of a pea.

You were a bed wetter, if I recall.

You know what Jake would
really get a kick out of?

If you could sing
while Charlie played the piano.

No, Alan. I couldn't.

- Besides, Charlie always hated that.
- Are you kidding? It was his idea.

Pick it up, Charlie.
We are walking, not crawling.

"Are you ready, boots? Start walking. "

- Okay, now.
- One more time.

Mom, you okay?

Yeah, go back to bed, Charlie.

No, I'm up.

It's hard to sleep after a big show.

Thank you for that.

Brought back some nice memories.

You still got some chops, Mom.

You were rushing
the tempo towards the end there.

Sorry, I always get a little carried away
when you do the James Brown medley.

Charlie.

Your mother's a real sad case,
isn't she?

You'll get over him. There's other guys.

He never even called.
Never even said goodbye.

Maybe he was scared.

Of what?

I knew there were no promises,
no strings.

That doesn't mean there
can't be common courtesy.

To think I mean that little to him?

It will be okay, Mom.

You still got me and Alan.

Charlie, please. I know how difficult
things are between us.

Maybe it's my fault.

It's not all your fault.

I probably haven't been the best son.

I just want you
to know that in my way,

I want you to be happy and...

I love you.

I guess I'll go pack.

- Why?
- I'm going home.

- In the middle of the night?
- Charlie, you just said you loved me.

You could only screw it up from here.

Donkey Kong!

- Danke Schoen.
- Danke Schoen.

Danke Schoen. B flat. One, two, three.

.......... ********** ..........

I have my own room at Mom's house, too.

My dad doesn't.
His stuff's in the garage.

Do you know how to play Vampire Hunter?
'Cause I just got it.

No, sorry.

You got to chop off their heads.
Otherwise they'll keep coming at you.

Do you know where your uncle keeps
the paper towels?

I think there's some up there.

Hi. You must be Alan. I'm Cindy.

Hi.

- Hey, Jake, it's time to get dressed.
- Wait a minute.

Can you get me a bowl
from that top shelf?

Come on, let's go.

What happened to "Breakfast
is the most important meal of the day"?

Just go get dressed.

Charlie, there is a half-naked woman
in our kitchen.

Which half?

- Hey, Cindy.
- Hey, Charlie.

- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about yourself?

Pretty good. Thanks again.

- I'll see you soon.
- Anytime.

Bye.

"How you doing"? "Thanks again"?

Charlie, casual sex is one thing,
but this is just lazy.

What are you talking about?
I didn't have sex with her.

She just surfs out on the Point,
uses my shower and goes to work.

So you're not sleeping with her?

Jeez, Alan, I don't sleep with every
buff surfer chick that uses my shower.

What kind of guy do you think I am?

I think you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the face of the earth, but,

that's not my point. I don't want women
flashing their butt tattoos at my son.

- Cindy has a tattoo?
- Yes, a butterfly.

Right cheek or left?
No, wait, don't tell me.

I want to be surprised.

So you're not sleeping with her,
but you want to.

Yeah.

What kind of guy do you think I am?

When I moved in here,
I said it was vital that we create

a wholesome atmosphere for Jake.
And you said, "I understand. "

Alan, there's something
you should know about me.

When I say I understand,
it doesn't mean I agree.

It doesn't mean I understand.
It doesn't even mean I'm listening.

Then why do you say it?

It seems to make people happy,
and that's what I'm all about.

That's very altruistic, but I would prefer
 if you'd just be straight with me.

- Fine.
- All I'm asking is that you keep in mind

that we have an impressionable
10-year-old boy living here.

- I understand.
- Thank you.

- That sounds nice.
- Thanks.

So where are Jake and Alan today?

Jake's at school and Alan's at work.

It's just you and me.

Tell them I said hi.
Thanks again for the shower.

You bet. You look really nice.

Thank you. Bye.

Yeah, I got work to do.

Charlie, seeing you strike out
like that just makes me love you more.

Rose, you've got to get a hobby.

I've got a hobby.

- I thought we agreed we were just friends.
- We are.

We're friends who slept together once

and then one friend never called
the other friend,

but luckily,
the other friend forgave him.

Where are you going?

To make my friend
a grilled cheese sandwich.

Rose, I don't want
a grilled cheese sandwich.

Would you prefer a quesadilla?

That sounds nice.

But then you have to leave.

Hey, Judith. Alan's at work.

I know where Alan is.
I came to talk to you.

- Me? But you don't like me.
- I don't.

I like you.

Jake's fourth grade class
was given a simple assignment.

Draw something interesting
you see around the house.

One child drew a record player,
another drew a parrot.

My son drew this.

A woman's behind with
a butterfly tattoo.

On the right cheek.

I'll have to just act surprised.

I asked him where he saw this.
He said, "In Uncle Charlie's kitchen. "

You gotta admit,
it beats the hell out of a parrot.

Charlie, I am not in the mood.

- Hold that thought.
- I got it.

Hello.

Are you in for your mother?

Charlie's in a meeting right now.
But you can talk to me.

Heck,
I feel like we're practically related.

- Is that the girl in the picture?
- Rose?

No.
She doesn't have a tattoo on her butt.

I'm guessing.

Look, I don't care what you do
in your private time,

but when my son is here,
I expect you to clean up your act.

- I understand.
- I don't like coming over here

and being the bad guy,
but I have to protect my son.

I understand.

It's hard enough going through
this transition all by myself.

Alan at least has you, I have no one.

Except my parents,
and they're completely toxic.

I understand.

Do you?

I think I do.

Thank you. That means a lot to me.

I mean, I've always been
the good daughter or the good wife.

And you know what?

Outside of those relationships,
I don't know who I am.

Am I gay, am I straight?
Who the hell knows?

I'm scared about this, Charlie,
and I'm totally alone.

You know what?

I understand.

Thank you for listening.

Hey.

I'm so sorry to take up your time
with all of this.

Hey.

I understand.

- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

There's five minutes of my life
I'll never get back.

Don't fill up. Your mom's taking us
out for lunch.

Hey. Where have you been?

I just had lunch with my mother
and my stalker.

They spent the afternoon eating off
each other's plates

and discussing my fear of intimacy.

You do have that, you know.

Anyway, look, can we talk
about this picture Jake drew?

What's to talk about? He's a boy.
He saw a woman's ass. He liked it.

Thank your lucky stars it
wasn't the cable guy's ass, and move on.

Hey, Dad. Where's Cankun?

Cancún?

No, it's spelled Cankun.

It's in Mexico. Why?

We should go there for Christmas
instead of Aunt Betty's.

- What are you reading?
- Sports Illustrated.

But it's mostly ladies in bathing suits.

Jake. Come back here.

Are you happy?

I have my moments,
but they're becoming further apart.

- Jake, sit down.
- Am I in trouble?

No. It's perfectly natural for you
to be interested in women's bodies.

- Great. I'll be in my room.
- Wait.

Let's talk a minute here.

I don't mind you
looking at these pictures,

but it's important
that you know what they mean.

I'd like to know that, too, Alan.

Okay. First of all,
real women don't look like this.

These pictures have been retouched
and airbrushed

so that the women look like
they're perfect. But they're really not.

Excuse me, but I met that one,
and she was perfect.

What I'm trying to explain to Jake

is that this is not
what regular women look like.

Then why don't they use regular women?

Because the only way regular women
can sell magazines is door-to-door.

My point is that these women
are three-dimensional human beings.

They're not just sex objects.

Which explains why this one's
on all fours in the surf.

- Are you quite done?
- No. I think you're being very unfair.

These women worked very hard,
ate very little,

and spent a lot of money
to become sex objects.

Those breasts alone cost $10,000.

You can buy these?

Thank you, Charlie.

Some women choose

to make their breasts larger

with what's called surgical implants.

- Why?
- They think bigger is better.

I can see that.

What really matters, Jake,
is what's inside a person.

See, that's the lesson here.
Do you get what I'm saying?

- I think so.
- You're sure?

There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I mean...

Do you have any questions?

- Just one.
- Fire away.

Can I have my magazine back?

Congratulations, Alan.

You've managed to take the fun
out of boobs.

Hello. Hi, Judith.

Yeah, I'm so glad you called. I just...
What?

She wants to talk to you.

- Why does my wife want to talk to you?
- I don't know.

Hey, Judith. What's up?

I understand.

What do you understand?

Not a thing.

I understand.

What's she saying?

Hang on, Judith. That's my other line.

She's upset because her parents want
to take Jake to SeaWorld.

She feels like this is
crossing a boundary

since they've been
so unsupportive recently.

And she's not sure
if her anger is misplaced.

Since when are you her new best friend?

I don't know.
Something's gone horribly wrong.

Sorry, you were saying?

I understand.

You're the coolest. Love, Cindy.

Are you sure
your nephew's gonna like this?

Who says it's for my nephew?

- You're really cute.
- Good.

I'm sorry there's no waves.

Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna get
my exercise today.

It's a puzzler.

Why don't you open up another
bottle of wine

- and we'll figure something out.
- Okay.

I'm sorry to just drop by,
but I had to talk to somebody.

I just left Jake with my parents
so they could take him to San Diego,

and I got in this terrible argument
with my father.

He thinks it's my fault
that Alan and I are breaking up,

and he knows exactly
how to push my buttons.

The question is
why do I need his approval?

Why do I need approval from any man?

I understand.

Charlie, how could you
possibly understand?

I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you had company.

No, we were just hanging out. I'm Cindy.

- Hi. Judith.
- Hi.

I've spent the better part of my life
trying to win my father's approval.

- You, too?
- Yeah, I almost married a guy

- just 'cause my father liked him.
- I married a guy just like my father.

- Disaster, right?
- It's his brother.

I met him. He's pretty tightly wound.

- He is.
- Yeah.

- Do you want some wine?
- I want a lot of wine.

Yeah.

You know it's so funny
about relationships and men.

- You just wonder all the time.
- Always.

I do not understand.

Morning, neighbor.

- Charlie's not up yet, Rose.
- Oh, Alan,

don't you think I know that?

I brought a Frisbee for your son.
It's a Glow-in-the-Dark Pro model.

- There are teeth marks in it.
- They're not mine.

Actually, Jake's in San Diego
with his mom's parents.

Boy, that hardly seems fair.

Evelyn never gets any quality time
with him.

- Evelyn?
- Your mom.

I know her name.

But do you know how much
she loves you,

and would appreciate a call
once in a while?

Hi, Alan. Shower open?

- Yeah. Help yourself.
- Hi, Alan.

Judith? What are you doing here?

Cindy's teaching me to surf.
She says I'm a natural.

'Cause she's got
the upper body strength for it.

Nothing like yours.

You will.
You just gotta build up your lats.

Wow! They're so firm.

Come on. I'll show you some exercises
before we hit the shower.

So, when's Charlie getting up?

In about nine seconds.

Wake up!

What? I was having a great dream.

Your girlfriend and my wife.
Surfing. Showering. Rubber suits.

Okay. This might be better.

Charlie, you've got to do something.

- You're right.
- Yeah.

Charlie, what are you gonna do?

What do you think? I just woke up.

Come on. They could
be lathering each other up right now!

Alan,
you're not helping this go any faster.

I can't believe this is going on under
my own roof. Well, under your roof.

God knows what's going on under my roof.

- You know, there is good news here.
- Really? What's that?

Now we know why
I never got anywhere with Cindy.

Hello? Me?

Okay, listen.

What do we really know here?

Your wife has taken up surfing.

We're good so far, right?

She made a new friend. Still good?

Yeah, I guess.

Do we know for a fact
that they're showering together?

- No.
- Okay.

So what do we know for sure
about Cindy and Judith?

Cindy's not interested in you,
and Judith thinks she's gay.

There you go.

And I got to see penguins
and a manta ray.

And I got to pet a shark.
And the coolest thing was the whales.

They splashed everybody.

You could see right through
this one lady's shirt.

And I think maybe she had plants.

Implants.

Yeah. Implants.

I asked Grandma if she had them,
and Grandpa said, "I wish. "

And then she got mad at him
and then they bought me ice cream.

So you had a good trip?

Yeah. When I got home,
I went to the movies with Mom and Cindy.

Wait. You, Mom and Cindy?

There you go.

- She's gonna teach me to surf.
- Of course she is.

She's not gonna be happy
until the whole damn family surfs.

Why don't we give her
Aunt Betty's number?

Squeeze that fat ass into a wet suit.

Here, Jake. Take your pizza
and go watch TV in your room.

Dad said "fat ass. "

You've seen Aunt Betty.
It's not swearing if it's true. Now go.

She gets all bent out of shape
when Cindy

is prancing around here
with her butterfly butt sticking out.

But all of a sudden it's okay,
'cause the butt is on the other foot.

Alan, chill out, buddy.

No! This is the worst kind of hypocrisy
and it will not stand.

Forgive me, Alan,
but that self-righteous attitude

is a big part of what drove Judith away
in the first place.

What? Where did you get...
Where? Did she tell you that?

Hey,
girlfriends tell each other everything.

Don't look at me like that.

Listen, if she really is gay, then
there's nothing you can do about it.

Except maybe try and figure out why
a lesbian married you in the first place.

But if she's just experimenting

and you act all loving and supportive,

then maybe she comes back
to the home team.

Or maybe I could find it in my heart
to actually be loving and supportive.

Sure, if you want to reinvent the wheel.

Hey. You know, I would've been more
than happy to drop Jake to your house.

No problem. This worked out great.

I've been surfing all day with Cindy
and we just had a bite to eat.

Isn't that nice.
Listen, are you in a hurry?

Because there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

No, I guess not. What's up?

I just wanted to let you know that

I'm okay with this. More than okay.

I understand, love and respect you
for your courage

to explore things.

Thank you.
I'm really starting to enjoy it.

And I support that.

Yeah, I've only done it
on my knees so far,

but Cindy says I'm almost ready
to try it standing up.

You know what?
I don't need to hear the details.

The more important thing
is that I accept

you and Cindy as lovers.
And more power to you, sister.

You pompous, assuming bastard.

You think I'm sleeping with her?

No.

I just got out of a 12-year marriage
and you think I would jump

into bed with someone I just met?
Man or woman?

- No.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

- I am.
- Two women become friends,

and you jump to the conclusion
they're having sex!

Where do you get that kind
of sleazy thinking?

The jogger. The one on the left.

Real?

Good eye.

With the sports bra,
that could have gone either way.

Of course, if they do go either way,
they're usually fake.

Jake, honey, get your stuff,
we're going home.

- Okay. See you, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy. Hey, girlfriend.

Don't "girlfriend" me,
you shallow piece of crap.

Fake.

Real.

Jake!

Who does she think she's kidding
with those things?

Jake, I swear, if you don't stop it,
I'm taking you home.

I understand.

.......... ********** ..........

This is where I sit.

Right on. Good location.

What else?

That's the sink.

If you put your thumb over the hole,
you can squirt water

all the way over to the other side
of the room.

Cool.

I'm not allowed to use the sink anymore.

Got it.

- So, what's the deal with your teacher?
- Miss Tuttle? She's very strict.

That could work.

Did you see this drawing our son made?

It's a cry for his parents
to get back together.

Alan, it's Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

I know. Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

I can see you got your brother here.

Yeah, he wasn't thrilled about it,
but he can't say no to Jake.

And I kind of implied that Miss Tuttle
was a bit of a freak.

Excuse me?

You wanted me to get him here.
He's here. The rest is up to you.

So, come on. You gonna introduce me?

- What for?
- She's your teacher.

You're my nephew. I feel like...
Come on, just do it.

Don't you want to see my model
of a California mission?

- It's made of sugar cubes.
- Okay.

First your mission, then mine.

May I have everyone's attention? Hello.

I'm Judith Harper, the class mom.

I just want to thank you all for coming.
This is a great turnout.

Give yourselves a hand.

I understand you teachers
are sadly underpaid.

That's very true.

I'd like to do my part.
Can I buy you dinner?

So please feel free to put your name
on the sign-up sheets

if you're available
for carpools, coaching, fieldtrips.

Charlie Harper.

Jake's uncle, mentor, pal.

And finally,
and this is a biggie, folks.

It looks as if we're
gonna have to cancel

our annual music show
for our fourth graders.

Unless someone with music experience
volunteers to help us out.

Anyone? Anyone at all?

- Charlie?
- Yeah.

Thank you. Charlie Harper, everyone.

What?

Go ahead, say it.

You traitorous, rat bastard.

Good. You feel better?

You set me up. You lured me
into that classroom

with promises of donuts
and loose women.

I'm sorry. I honestly thought
there'd be donuts.

What about Miss Tuttle? The freak?

She's a married Christian missionary!

Okay, that I just lied about.

But it was for a good cause.
The kids really need you.

Yeah, but see, here's the problem.
I don't like kids.

- You like Jake.
- Jake's different. He's cool. He's our kid.

The rest of them.

- What other kids do you know?
- I see them.

Having tantrums in supermarkets,

screaming in movie theaters,
making everything sticky.

And the whole world gives them
a free ride just because they're cute.

Okay. Forget about the kids.
Do this for me and Judith.

Not really a big Judith fan, either.

Come on.
You'll write the music and lyrics.

Judith and I
will produce and direct. Together.

Hold on.

So you roped me into this
because you think

that the three of us collaborating
on a fourth-grade tribute

to the Industrial Revolution will somehow
lead to you getting back together

with your allegedly gay ex-wife?

It's easy to make anything
sound stupid, Charlie.

Look, we're still legally married.
Frankly, I don't buy the whole gay thing.

A gay woman would not fake orgasms
for 12 years just to protect my feelings.

Okay. Take off your seat belt.

- Why?
- Because when I slam on the brakes,

I want to watch you
go through the windshield.

Don't be silly. Do you know how fast
you'd have to be going to...

Hey, slow down.

Manpower, horsepower, coal and steam

Moving forward the American dream

Electric, atomic, solar, too

All this energy for me and you

- I want to like it.
- Yeah, want to like it.

- But?
- But I just don't think it's your best work.

It's not. Fire me, please.

Do you remember that show
that you and I did in college?

Stormy Weather? Sure.

- Now, those songs had a point of view.
- Yeah.

And you couldn't get them
out of your head.

Co-ed bathrooms, co-ed bathrooms

Wear your flip-flops
in the co-ed bathrooms

Stuff grows on the floor there

And whoops! There's another pubic hair

See? Maybe the easiest way to do this
is for us to write the actual song.

Yeah. Then Charlie could just toss in
the specific notes and stuff.

Yeah, Charlie, what do you think?

Okay,
then I guess it's just the two of us.

- Like the old days.
- Yeah. Except this time I'm not a virgin.

How come you're not
helping Mom and Dad with the show?

How can I put this?

Your uncle Charlie is a professional
musician, and your mom and dad...

Suck?

Good a word as any.

I think they're gonna get back together.

- You do?
- Yep.

Except if my Dad moves back
to Mom's house,

I probably wouldn't see you anymore.

Of course you'd see me. You'd still have
your room here, and I'd come visit.

- You never visited before.
- That's 'cause I didn't know you before.

That's 'cause you never visited.

Gin.

To tell you the truth, Jake,
I don't think this is gonna be an issue.

You don't think they're gonna
get back together?

- I didn't say that.
- Do you?

- Hey, what do I know?
- I think they are.

Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney

All aboard for Henry Ford

Henry Ford

And then...

Careful what you wish for, pal.

Charlie,
we're gonna be late for rehearsal.

- What are you doing?
- Making margaritas.

But we've got a rehearsal
at Jake's school.

Don't worry, I have a plan.

Charlie, you're taking liquor
to Jake's school?

You betcha.

I'm not gonna face all those pre-pubers
without a snootful.

They'll have limes
in the teacher's lounge, right?

No. There's no limes,
there's no swizzle sticks, there's...

- Oh, God.
- What?

It's from Judith's lawyers.

Really? Good news?

No, it's not good news.
Judith filed for divorce.

Man. I'm sorry.

What am I gonna do?

There's a lot of ways to respond
to something like this.

Anger, grief, denial.

What would you do?

I'd probably blow off rehearsal
and start chugging from the blender.

But I wouldn't recommend that
for an amateur.

I can't believe she blind-sided
me like this.

Being so nice and friendly to my face.

Meanwhile her lawyers were working
behind my face.

Let me tell you something, Charlie.

A woman who would do such a thing
cannot be trusted.

Yeah, well, maybe you can use
this divorce as a chance to

take a little break from each other.

No, that would be playing
right into her hands.

Alan, your kid's confused enough about
you and his mother. Don't make it worse.

How could I possibly make it any worse?

Let's find out.

Okay, everybody, what we're gonna do
is put the girls on one side

- and the boys on the other.
- Sure.

Start splitting them up early. That's
your answer for everything, isn't it?

Excuse me?

Would Mrs. Plaintiff please see
Mr. Respondent in the hallway?

Watch the kids, we'll be right back.

Wait!

Jake? Where's Jake?

Okay. Everybody take five.

That means sit down.

Stand up.

Hop up and down.

Right on.

But why file for divorce?
We were getting along so well.

We've been getting along
because I don't feel trapped,

suffocated and depressed anymore.

Sure, kick me out,
then work on improving yourself.

Okay. Everybody flap your arms
like a chicken.

Alan, check it out.
I got this amazing power.

Stop.

It's like having my own robot army.

No, wait, where are you going?

- Are we gonna do our songs?
- Hey, I'm just the piano player.

Lerner and Lowe are out in the hallway
working things out.

- Who?
- Lerner and Lowe?

My Fair Lady? Camelot?

Aren't there any gay kids here?

- They're fighting again, aren't they?
- Yeah, what can I tell you.

Your Mom lawyered up
and your Dad is freaking out.

Stay cool,
I'll try to get them back in here.

Hey, everybody, Jake's in charge.
So, whatever he says.

Okay, it's been fun.

But I'm officially resigning
as the Mayor of Booger Town.

Not now, Charlie.

You know, I have tried everything I can
to make you happy.

I don't want to rush you or anything,
but have you ever read Lord of the Flies?

But you know what? You know what?
I'm through.

Maybe your lawyers can make you happy.

Your brother's a horse's ass.

Hey, let's not lose sight of who
the real victim of this divorce is.

Me!

Okay, I think we should all calm down
just a little.

You're not our teacher.
Why should we listen to you?

Okay, let me put it another way.

Shut up and sit down!

Thanks.

Now, listen, rehearsal's over.
You can all go home.

What about our play?

You know how they say,
"The show must go on"?

They weren't talking about this show.

- Your uncle's so lame.
- Is not. He's cool.

- Yeah, right.
- He is.

He's almost famous.
He wrote the Maple Loops song.

- Did not.
- Did, too!

- Prove it.
- You see that Jaguar in the parking lot?

Maple Loops.

That doesn't prove anything.

Fine.

It's got oats and corns and wheat

It's the sweetest breakfast treat
It's maple-licious

- Everybody knows that?
- Of course. It's the Maple Loops song.

- Uncle Charlie, do Fudge Nuggets.
- Yeah! Fudge Nuggets!

From the magic chocolate mountain

In a secret chocolate mine

Come granny's big fudge nuggets

With a taste that's oh so fine

What do you know.
Maybe I don't hate kids.

Hi.

I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads up about the divorce papers.

I'm sorry if I overreacted.

Just the girls.

- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

Smell like a man

Stick, pump or can

With Dry Guy Deodorant

Only the girls get sweaty

We're getting there.

Okay, thank you, Charlie.

Yeah, we'll take it from here, okay?

Too late. You're out.

What about the songs we wrote?

Hey, kids, what do you think about
the songs they wrote?

They're bad.

These are my people.

What do your jingles have to do
with the Industrial Revolution?

Look, you wanted a show,
I'm giving you a show.

Now step back and let us work.

Plumber in a Jar.
Let's really sell it this time.

When your sink backs up
there's just one star

It's the one you trust
It's Plumber in a Jar

Plumber in a Jar

Hey, what you doing?

I'm trying to find some plausible
connection between my jingles

and the Industrial Revolution.

- What's up?
- I just talked to my dad.

He said that he and Mom
aren't getting back together again.

Yeah.

- How you doing with that?
- I'm not sure.

I like that I get to stay here
on weekends.

That's cool. I like that, too.

But you gotta be sad about your folks,
though, right?

No, I'm okay.

Jake,
it's okay to feel sad, I've been told.

- And this is a sad thing.
- My dad's not sad.

Of course he is.
He's just trying to protect you.

- From what?
- From being sad.

Yeah, I know it's a vicious circle.
But the liquor industry is built on it.

- What?
- It's not important.

All you need to know is that
we all feel sad sometimes and it's okay.

- Understand?
- Yeah.

Hey, buddy.

It's okay, Dad.

Before the Industrial Revolution,
we lived in an agrarian society.

Most people grew their own food and
ate what they grew. Breakfast involved...

...slaughtering animals...

...and milking cows.

It would be hundreds of years
before people could enjoy

a pre-packaged and nutritious breakfast.
And what's in that breakfast?

It's got oats and corns and wheat

It's the sweetest breakfast treat

It's maple-licious

As urbanization led to stress and
loneliness, industrial society looked

to an ancient agrarian product for
a delicious and refreshing solution.

The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer

You like what you see
and you like what you hear

Have a cold frosty mug and pull her near

The girls look prettier

The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer

We're not letting him
anywhere near the Christmas pageant.

Agreed.

Even with the advent of indoor plumbing,

the Industrial Revolution
still had some bugs in the system.

What was man to do?

Three, four...

If your home is bug infested

Filled with spiders, flies, and gnats

All our sprays are safety tested

We kill vermin, not your cats

.......... ********** ..........

- Charlie.
- Come on.

That tickles!

- Uncle Charlie?
- Not now, Jake.

I just heard the Fudge Nuggets song
you wrote on TV.

Great.

Great.

- Jake, I'm not alone in here.
- No way.

Way.

- Who's in there?
- A friend of mine.

- Is it a girl?
- Hold on.

Oh, yeah.

Is it Janet?

No.

It's my friend Wendy.
Say hi to Jake, Wendy.

Hi, Jake. You sing really well.

I have to go. This is embarrassing.

- I like that you didn't lie to him.
- I try to be honest.

It's a good quality. So, who's Janet?

You want a cup of coffee before you go?

No, you've got work to do.
I should probably get going.

Charlie, there's French toast left.

No, thanks. You met Wendy, right?

Sure. French toast, Wendy?

No, thank you.
I should really get going.

You know, I can sing
all of Uncle Charlie's jingles.

No kidding?
You're gonna have to show me sometime.

- That's wonderful.
- Wendy's gotta go, Jake.

Jake! Take five, buddy.

Copasetic. That means okay.

When he moved in here,
he was saying "swell. "

Charlie, I've gotta go to my office
for a couple of hours.

- Are you okay to watch Jake?
- No problem.

Swell.

Will you take me Rollerblading,
Uncle Charlie?

- I can't, buddy. I got work to do.
- What am I gonna do all day?

It's really nice outside.
Why don't you wash my car?

No, I wanna go Rollerblading.

I could take him.
I've got my blades right in the car.

- Really?
- If it's okay with your father.

- That sounds swell.
- I'll go get my blades.

And if you want, I can go pick up lunch
and bring it back and we can have a picnic.

Yeah. Swell.

Nice girl. Is it serious?

It is now, you dumb-ass.

Finish your jingle?

How can I work?

First, Wendy took Jake Rollerblading.
Then she took him to the movies.

Now she's in the kitchen,
making us all dinner.

That bitch.

Don't you get it?

She's using your kid
to turn a nice, casual relationship

into a relationship.

Okay, now I get
where you're coming from.

- Thank you.
- You're paranoid and you're nuts.

Perfect timing. Dinner's ready.

Did you see that?

She's wearing an apron.

In my house!

Do you know what that means?

I'm gonna stick with paranoid
and nuts, Bob.

Are you sure that you don't want me
to stay and do the dishes?

Positive. Alan would just re-wash
them anyways.

- I guess I should probably get going.
- Yeah, I guess.

Good, you're still here.
Jake wants to say good night.

Wow, he's such a sweetie.
Don't you just want to eat him up?

If that would stop him, yes.

I gotta tell you, Charlie.
I think that girl's a keeper.

- You think so?
- Yeah, she's smart,

she's pretty,
and I think she really likes you.

Be honest, Alan.
You married the first girl

who slipped you the tongue, didn't you?

- No.
- Trust me,

this woman has a plan.

And it's diabolical
in its Machiavellian scope.

I did not marry the first girl
who slipped me the tongue.

I'm telling you, she's got her foot
in the door and she will never leave.

Okay, I'm out of here.

Diabolical!

- Okay. So, I'll give you a call?
- Yeah. That'd be great. Okay.

It's pretty dark out.

Maybe you should go in the morning.

Yeah, I guess I could.

Are you seeing this?

Howdy, neighbor.

Charlie's busy right now, Rose.

I know. White Toyota hasn't
budged an inch two nights in a row.

I chalked her tires.

You do know there's a stairway
right over there?

Of course.

Did you know
there's a crawl space under the house

that comes right up into your bedroom?

- So, what are you doing?
- I'm playing computer Scrabble.

All by yourself? That's so sad.

I used to play with my wife every night,
and I guess I miss it.

You and I have a lot in common,
don't we?

How so?

We're both like two lonely socks that want
desperately to keep someone's feet warm.

But we don't match up
with any other socks.

So all we can hope for
is to be a dust mitten,

or a hand puppet.

That's very insightful.

And disturbing.

You're not thinking you and me, are you?

That's very flattering, but...

Wendy?

"Dear Charlie,
thanks for a wonderful night.

"Sweet. Special. See you soon. "

Freedom!

I'm free, I'm so free

All right, you had sex last night.
You don't have to turn into Mr. Bojangles.

It's better than that.
I had sex and I woke up alone.

If there were pancakes on my night table,
it would be the perfect morning.

What happened to Wendy's diabolical,
Machiavellian scheme to never leave?

I don't know.
I must have foiled it somehow.

Guess what? Grandma's here!

Let's see that little dance again.

When I was pregnant with Charlie,
we thought he was gonna be a girl.

The sonogram showed
no discernible penis whatsoever.

Now do you believe me?

First she sucks in Jake, then you,
now Mom.

She's like one of those pods
from outer space.

But, you know, with a cute ass.

She wouldn't even be here now if
you hadn't taken her upstairs last night.

That was not my fault.
You saw how she kissed me.

I had to take her upstairs.

And remember what I said.
Hook him on the milk, he'll buy the cow.

Charlie, where have you been
hiding this girl?

She's an absolute delight!

Yeah, she's swell.

- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning.

I read somewhere you had left.

I was on my way out the door,
and then I ran into your mom,

and then we started talking,
and, you know.

Yeah, I know.

So what brings you here, Mom?

- Do I need a reason?
- I'd like one.

I'm showing a house in Malibu.
I thought I'd swing by

and take my grandson out for pancakes.

Charlie wants his on his night table.

I'm ready. You coming, Dad?

Are you kidding?
I want to hear more about that sonogram.

Good. Are you and Wendy
joining us, Charlie?

Gee, Mom, I think Wendy has stuff to do.
Right, Wendy?

I can always make time for pancakes.

Wonderful. A family breakfast.

Go put on some pants, Charlie.

- But, Mom, I...
- Now.

You have to be firm with him.

By the way, your nose is adorable.

- Thank you.
- I'm guessing Dr. Shapiro?

No, it's mine.

Sometimes God does good work, too.

Jake, get your stuff together,
we gotta get you back to your mom's.

Already? But we're playing.

Yeah, I gotta get going, too, Jake.

Okay. I pulled your car around.

If you leave now, I think you'll
miss all the weekend traffic.

Don't you worry, Charlie, I'm leaving.

I'm not worried. I just moved your
car so Alan can get out.

I can get out.

Yes, Alan. Now you can.

Thank you for a great weekend.

No, thank you.

- Jake, bye.
- Bye.

- Alan, I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

I gotta tell you, Charlie,
I think she's really...

Okay. What?

I'm just saying,
I think she's really great.

Me, too. When's she coming back?

Let's see. Today's Sunday, so... Never.

Why not?

Buddy, she wants something different
in a relationship

than your uncle Charlie does.

- What does she want?
- Uncle Charlie.

- What do you want?
- Uncle Charlie.

And we both can't have me.

- I don't understand.
- It's very simple, buddy.

Uncle Charlie is nuts.

Yeah, nuts like a fox.

So then Wendy can't take me
Rollerblading anymore?

- Nope.
- No more movies?

Afraid not.

Boy, you suck.

Suck? How do I suck?

Like a fox.

There he is! Let the party begin!

Shaking Jake! Notorious J-A-K-E!

Jake, he won't stop until you say hello.

Jakety-Jake-Jake!

Hello.

How was school this week?
We missed you around here.

- It was just school.
- Yeah, I heard that. "Just school. "

Right on.

I don't believe it.
He's still mad about the Wendy thing.

Charlie, it's only been a week.

I'm still mad that you peed
in my Boy Scout canteen in 1978.

Not much of a jamboree for you, was it?

Okay, I'm sorry about the canteen.

Now will you please make your son
like me again?

How would I do that, Charlie?
And by the way, was that so hard?

Explain to him that Wendy
was working an angle,

making friends with him to get to me.

Do you really want me
to tell a 10-year-old boy

that somebody he cares about
was pretending to like him?

What kind of lesson is that?

He lives in LA.
He might as well learn now.

Just give him some time.
He'll get over it.

- Can I come in?
- It's your house.

- Well, it's your house, too.
- Then, no.

Okay.

You know what? It is my house.

Look, I'm sorry about the Wendy thing,
but there's nothing I can do about it.

And I want us to be buddies again.
I don't want you to hate me anymore.

- I don't hate you.
- Good.

I'm just very disappointed in you.

I get enough of that crap from
my mother.

So what's it gonna take?
Cash? Video games?

I don't want stuff.

I got plenty of stuff
when my mom and dad broke up.

Dude, this isn't the same thing.

What's the difference? You liked Wendy,
then you didn't like her,

and no one cares what I want.

Jake, buddy. Come here.

Come here.

Sit down.

It's not that I don't care
what you want.

It's just that you're a kid.
And what you want doesn't matter.

Wow, I do suck.

H- A-T.

Hat.

That's it? All this time for "hat"?

Let me see your tiles.

See. You had "hateful. "

See, it would have fit right here,
off the "A" in my "quotidian. "

Wow, how did you see that?

I have Scrabble eyes. It's a gift.

And sometimes a curse.

Alan, Jake won't play with me.

Well, I can't play with you either,
Charlie. I am "occupied. "

You played "pie" at your own peril,
my friend.

- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Rose.

Alan, come here.

Your move.

What?

- What are you doing with Rose?
- I'm teaching her to play Scrabble.

- Alan, you are so naive!
- "Naive," eight points.

What?

Sorry. I'm in my game head.

Alan, Rose is using you to get to me.

Do you hear the rampant egotism,

"rampant," 11 points, "egotism," 10,

coming out of your mouth?

- I'm just saying...
- Not everybody is trying to get to you.

The only thing that's going on here

is two lonely people
playing a game of Scrabble.

Please tell me you're not thinking
about you and Rose?

Me and Rose?

Let's see.

One Russian blonde.

One Scottish brunette.

And a full-bodied redhead
from Napa Valley.

Charlie's angels.

- Sorry. Oh, hi.
- Hi.

- What are you doing here?
- I'm grocery shopping.

Here? In my supermarket?

So this is just a coincidence?

Well, it's not entirely.
I eat food, and I live two blocks away.

Come on, Wendy. We both know that...

- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

Dave, this is Charlie. Charlie, Dave.

Dave, we need a Duraflame log.

Okay.

- Who's that? Your brother?
- No, he's...

Look, Charlie, I know
I probably should've given you a call,

but I thought that after last weekend,
it was pretty clear,

it wasn't gonna work out
between you and me.

What?

I was happy to entertain
your nephew for a while.

I mean, he's a great kid,
but who's got the energy?

And your mother,
she's been calling me all week.

She wants to go to a spinning class
with me. What is up with that?

I thought you two hit it off.

I'm from the Midwest.
I was being polite.

What did you think was going on?

That.

- So, no hard feelings?
- No, of course not.

So you and Dave, how serious is that?

Goodbye, Charlie.

You know,
you're breaking a little boy's heart.

You see, my relationships with women,
they come and go.

But you and me, we're family.

That's solid.
That's forever. You with me?

I think so.

Maybe I shouldn't be laying this on you,
because you're 10.

But I'm beginning to realize

I might not be the guy I thought
everybody thought I was.

Yeah, it's a mind blower, isn't it?

You see, the problem isn't with
who I go out with.

The problem is with me.

Your Uncle Charlie
has major trust issues with women.

And I think it might have something to
do with my relationship with my mom.

I understand.

Do you?

No, I'm just tired and
I don't care anymore.

So, we're cool?

- Yeah.
- Good.

- Good night.
- Good night.

- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah.

Does this mean you don't have
nuts like a fox?

Yeah.

That's what it means.

Don't look at my tiles, Alan.

Scrabble eyes, my sweet patootie.
He's a tile peeker.

Rose, listen.
I think I owe you an apology.

You mean for seducing me
with your roguish charms

and then dumping me
like a bag of old doorknobs?

That, and more recently...

I told Alan that you were being nice
to him just to get close to me.

And I've come to realize
that's my own paranoia about women

trying to manipulate me. And I'm sorry
that I projected that on you.

Come here, you big silly.

- I forgive you.
- Really?

Thank you.

Okay. I gotta go. Your brother
is out of control with that egg timer.

You think maybe I could play
with you guys?

It's fine with me.
Go ask Mr. That's-not-a-word.

Thanks.

And again, I'm sorry.

I'll be right there.

Phase 1, complete.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey, what are you doing?
- Picking out a shirt.

That one looks nice.

- You like it?
- Yeah.

Then, no.

Okay.

Listen, I was wondering,
do you have any plans for Thanksgiving?

- Alan, I don't think that far ahead.
- It's this Thursday.

No kidding.

Didn't we just get through
that whole pumpkin,

the costume thing with the kid?

- Halloween?
- Yeah.

Three weeks ago.

- No, I got no plans. Why?
- I was thinking,

Jake's gonna be with his mom
and her parents,

and I thought,
maybe you and I could do something.

Okay, want to go to Vegas?

I was thinking something
a little more traditional.

Reno?

- Charlie, it's a family holiday.
- Yeah, so, I'm your family.

Unless you want to spend
a perfectly good Thursday

with "Mom, The Impaler. "

- Think we can get into the Bellagio?
- Leave it to me.

That one's nice.

Here's what we'll do.

We'll fly to Vegas,
have a big steak dinner,

get you a lap dance
and a bucket of nickels.

- What are the nickels for?
- I'll explain it on the plane.

That sounds kind of fun.
Two single guys, rocking out in Vegas,

- the glitz, the glamour...
- Dude, don't gay it up.

You know, I like this shirt much better.

Stop screwing with me, Alan.

So, who's the lucky gal?

- Remember Lisa?
- Lisa-who-used-to-live-here, Lisa?

She lived here, she moved out,
she lived here, I moved out.

At one point, neither one of us
lived here. Yeah, that Lisa.

Wow.
So, she's gonna take you back again?

Hey, who said she's the one
who broke up with...

Yeah, I'm hoping.

- Good luck.
- Thanks.

I've completely lost confidence
in this shirt.

- Hey, Lees! Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

How many times did you change
your shirt before you left the house?

- I wanted to look pretty for you.
- You're such a girl.

Thanks, you, too.

- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

So, you want to just blow this place
and get a room?

- I can't.
- Why not?

I'm getting married.

Yeah. Ha, ha. Me, too.

- I'm not kidding.
- You can't do that, you love me.

That's not the point.

I'm tired of doing this dance of death
with you.

Hooking up, breaking up, making up.

That's not a dance of death.
That's the circle of life.

It may be your life, but it's not mine.
Not anymore.

- I'm moving on.
- To what?

To settling down, to having a family,

to not having my heart constantly broken
by a man who refuses to grow up.

And that would be me?

Yes, you, you big ass.

But the sex was awesome though, right?

Yes, it was.
But there's more to relationships...

- Is it awesome with your fiancé?
- None of your business.

It's not, is it?

God, why did I call you?

I'll tell you why.

Because in your heart, you know
you're about to make a huge mistake

and you want me to talk you out of it.

No, I was hoping you and I
could have some closure.

Then I refer you back to my suggestion
that we blow this place and get a room.

Same old Charlie.

What if I wasn't?
Would you still be marrying this clown?

Bo is not a clown.

- Bo?
- Bo.

I'm sorry, Bo-Bo is a clown.

Charlie, you'll never change.

Look at you, a grown man
who can't even commit to long pants.

Hey, I can commit to long pants.
I was just focused on the shirt today.

And for your information,
I've gone through changes

like you wouldn't believe
since the last time we were together.

- Like what?
- Well, I have a kid now.

God, Charlie,
what poor girl did you knock up?

No. It's my nephew.
He and my brother are living with me now.

- I'm like, Mr. Family Guy.
- Yeah, right, "Family Guy. "

How's it going with your mom?

What the hell's my mom
got to do with family?

Come on, Charlie, we both know

you'll never have a successful
relationship with any woman, let alone me,

until you resolve your issues
with your mother.

Well,

as a matter of fact, it just so happens

on that note, since you mentioned it,

- those issues are resolved.
- Really. How'd that happen?

You know,
communication, self-reflection,

personal growth, crap like that.

The important thing is,
I now have a much deeper appreciation

for what do you call them,
traditional values.

"Traditional values?"

This from a guy
who offered my sister a car

if she'd come to bed with us?

It was a joke, and I was drunk.

But still, it shows a yearning
for family.

- Okay, this is going nowhere.
- Lisa, wait. I'm sorry.

I don't want you to
not be in my life anymore.

I'd like us to be friends.

- I'd like that, too.
- Good.

- So when are you getting married?
- We haven't set a date.

We're gonna talk about it when Bo
gets back from New York on Monday.

- So, you're all alone for Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, why?

Change of plans.

What's so tough to understand?

We're gonna have
a big family dinner right here.

And whose big family
were you planning on inviting?

You know, you, me, Jake, Mom, turkey,
just like the good old days.

What good old days?

It's just an expression,
don't get hung up on it.

- Oh, and Lisa might come.
- Okay, what's going on?

- I need to show Lisa that I'm a family guy.
- But you're not.

That's not the point.

She's about to go off
and marry some jerk

just because he loves her
and wants to settle down.

I get it, you're Satan.

Alan, this is serious.
I could lose her forever.

Wow, and you care?

I love her, Alan.

She's the only one I ever thought
I might eventually wind up with.

"Eventually wind up with. "

I'm touched.

So you want to, what,
keep her warming up in your bullpen

until the bottom of the ninth
when you lose your arm?

Okay,
I don't know how we got onto sports,

but the thing is, I really care for Lisa

and she needs to believe
I'm capable of changing.

But the thing is, you're not.

You don't know that. I might be.

Who knows what would happen
if I actually tried.

You're really serious about this.

Alan, I've got a 200-pound turkey
melting in my lap.

- What do you think?
- Okay, how can I help?

Obviously, we can't have a family
Thanksgiving without a kid.

So you need to get Jake back
from your wife.

Simple as that?

Okay, so I go to Judith and I say,

"Forget the fact
that we agreed on a custody schedule,

"forget that your parents
are driving all the way from Sacramento

"to spend time with their grandson.
Charlie needs to use our son as a prop

"so he that can maintain
an on-again-off-again relationship

"with a woman with whom
he might eventually wind up. "

- You know what, I'll talk to her.
- Yeah.

No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

Okay,
maybe I didn't explain it correctly.

You explained it fine.
You're not taking Jake for Thanksgiving.

Not just Jake.
You can come, too, and your parents.

Think of it, the whole family,
just like the good old days.

What good old days?

Why is everybody so damn literal?

Judith, what is Thanksgiving about,
if not family?

Wouldn't it be good for Jake to spend
Thanksgiving with his whole family,

because that's what
Thanksgiving is about, family and stuff.

- I don't know.
- You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

I'll have someone there to do the cooking,
the serving, and the cleaning.

- Really? Who?
- My housekeeper, Berta.

She's a saint,
and she's really looking forward to this.

No way in hell.
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

- Come on.
- I don't work holidays, Charlie.

- Please.
- I've got a life, you know.

Pretty, please.

My brother is in
the Witness Protection Program,

and I've been invited to spend
Thanksgiving with him

at an undisclosed location.

- I'll give you $1,000.
- Done.

- Hi, you must be Jake.
- Yes, I am.

My wonderful Uncle Charlie
has opened his home

to me and my father
'cause we had nowhere else to go.

Hey, Merry Thanksgiving.

I like what you've done with the place.

You picked out everything here.

I know.
Just wanted to make sure you did.

Charlie, I've got to admit,
I never thought I'd see the day

when you'd be hosting
a family Thanksgiving.

Like I've been telling you,
I've changed.

So, with that in mind,

you wanna blow this place
and get a room?

- Charlie, stop it. Come on, introduce me.
- Fine.

Lisa, this is Judith,
my former sister-in-law,

- but still, you know, family.
- Hi.

- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

And these, of course,
are her wonderful parents,

- Sherman and Lorraine.
- Sheldon and Lenore.

Sheldon and Lenore.
It's great to see you, folks.

- So, Shelley, how you liking California?
- We live in California.

So you must really like it.

- Hi, Lisa. So nice to see you again.
- Hi, Alan, long time.

See, isn't this great?
This is why we all come together.

We break up, we make up,

but in the end, the love is the love
and the family is the family.

Ease up on the wine, Charlie.

No, he's right, and Alan,
Sheldon and I want you to know

that even though you and our daughter
are no longer married,

we will always think of you as our son.

What the hell's
that supposed to mean, Ma?

It means that, even though
you loused up your marriage,

we still love him.

Thanks a lot, Dad.
I appreciate the blame.

This is really Judith's family.
Let's go find mine.

- Hey, Berta. Look who's here.
- Hi, Berta.

Honey,
don't tell me you're back here again.

Don't you ever learn?

As a matter of fact, I think I have.

Good for you. You can do so much better.

And remember,
you may have two grandmothers,

but only one of them has enough money
to send you to medical school.

What if I don't want to go
to medical school?

Then you'd break
your grandmommy's heart

- just like your father did.
- Dad's a doctor.

No, sweetheart.
Your father's a chiropractor.

That's a masseuse without the hot oil.

- Go play with your friends.
- I'm the only kid here.

You might want to think about
why that is.

I want more money.

Hey, Mom.

You remember Lisa, right?
We used to live together.

No, I don't. I'm sorry. Hello, dear.

My son has had so many little roommates.

I just hope you've got better taste

than the one who picked out
his hideous furniture.

Hey, who's got unresolved issues
with her now?

Did it ever occur to you
that you might want to support me,

- your daughter?
- Why can't we support Alan, too?

- Because I'm divorcing him.
- Who told you to go and do that?

It's very sweet of you

to go to all this trouble,
but who are you kidding?

The plaid shirt,
the sweater vest, the kid actor.

No, that's really my nephew.

I love you, Charlie,
but you're not gonna change my mind.

- Live with me.
- Charlie.

- No, I'm serious. Move back in.
- Really? And then what?

And then, we'll see.

Wow, a commitment to "see. "

And what finger does that ring go on,
Charlie?

- You know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

You want me to waste
a couple of more years of my life

on a relationship
that's absolutely doomed to fail.

Not your life, our life.

Look, I appreciate your feelings for me,
but I have to tell you,

I really think your daughter deserves
a lot of respect.

It takes real courage to make changes
in your life and not worry

- about what everybody thinks.
- Thank you, Alan.

That's true.

The lesbians of my generation were
too scared to come out of the closet.

Does that mean what I think it means?

- You haven't told them?
- No.

I thought it would be more appropriate
coming from your mother.

I'm sorry, did I faux pas?

- Yes, just get her out of here.
- Mom...

What was I thinking?

Happy Thanksgiving.

Sorry I'm late, but I didn't
realize you're having a party.

- Hi, I'm Rose.
- Hi.

Don't worry. Charlie and I had sex once,
but now we're just friends.

Who's ready for mystery pie?

If you were living here,
these kinds of things

probably wouldn't happen.

Here it is.

Berta, nice looking bird,

thanks for blowing off your family
and cooking for ours.

Shove over.

Are we gonna go around the table
and say what we're thankful for?

Me, I got one.

I'm thankful for the food we eat,
and thankful for the friends we meet.

I'm thankful for my comfy seat.

I'm thankful for the birdie's feet.

White with foam, God bless America

- Pull up, Rose.
- Sorry.

- Jake, why don't you go?
- Okay.

I'm thankful for my mom and dad,
and my Uncle Charlie,

"who has shown in the few short months
that I've been here

"that he is capable of... "

Significant.

"... significant change and growth. "

- Too obvious?
- Little bit.

Okay, well, I'm thankful
that I can spend the holiday with

all the people I love,
and all the people who love me,

and Judith.

I'm thankful I'll be dead someday
and you'll all feel horrible

you weren't nicer to me.

And I'm thankful that our daughter

gave us at least one grandchild
before she...

I'm thankful I finally found a therapist

who has no compunction
about prescribing powerful sedatives.

I'm thankful I can sit here
and listen to you rich people whine

while my family's scrabbling for a corn
dog at the Pomona Fairgrounds.

- Charlie?
- No, you first.

I'm thankful for you,

and I hope you'll always be my friend.

Okay, well, I'm thankful for you, too.

And I'm thankful for everybody
coming together today

as unwitting participants
in my desperate charade.

Amen.

Okay, maybe I should carve the turkey.

I'll handle that for you, Son.

- No, you both sit down. I'll do it.
- No, Mom, I can do it.

No, don't be ridiculous.

- No, I insist. I would love to.
- I appreciate the hospitality.

Okay, everybody, stop!

Mom, give me the knife.

Charlie, don't be silly.
You don't know how to carve a turkey.

Maybe not,
but I'm the head of this household,

and the head of the household
is supposed to carve the turkey.

Why, because you saw it
on some TV show?

- I swear, you are just like your father.
- No, I am not just not like my father.

My father was afraid of you, and I'm not

anymore.

Okay, there was one unresolved issue.

Charlie, now you're being foolish.
Give me the knife and sit down.

Back off, lady.

Every Thanksgiving,
you took the knife away from Dad,

and when you did that,
you took away his manhood.

You're not gonna take it away from me.

There, see, it's carved.

It's carved with my manhood.

I don't think I'm very hungry anymore.

Lisa, marry me.

- Marry you? You want me to marry you?
- Yes,

you know, eventually.

You sure you don't want
some turkey for the road?

No, I'm fine.

So, are you gonna invite me
to your wedding?

Charlie.

Will you at least call me
when you get divorced?

You'll be first on my list.

- For what it's worth, I do love you.
- I know that.

- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

You look good in long pants.

Thanks.

Charlie,

we're still eating.

.......... ********** ..........

Okay, after I get the tickets,
you line up for the popcorn,

while I go nail down some good seats.

I want butter in the middle.
Don't just let them squirt it on the top.

And a large cherry slurpy.

Then you hold the seats
while I go to the men's room,

and then I'll do the same for you.

That way we can enjoy our drinks
during the movie without fear.

Got you.

- You're not gonna do any of that, are you?
- Nope.

So you want to go in there
with no coordination,

- no strategy, just winging it?
- That's what I'm thinking.

I have no faith in this at all.

Now for her,
I'd stand in line for a butter squirt.

Yeah, she is a hottie.

Hey, that's no hottie.
That's your ex-wife.

- Judith?
- Alan.

Sorry about the squirt thing.

Wow, look at you. New hair, clothes.

You look... Wow.

- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

It's a public service

when a gay chick goes lipstick
instead of lumberjack.

So, how was the movie? Where's Jake?

Home with the babysitter.
Alan, I'm kind of on a date.

Okay, is that her?

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm the ex.

Alan, that's not my date.

- Hey, Alan.
- Phil? What a coincidence.

Phil is Jake's soccer coach.
Phil, you remember Judith.

Well, yeah...

One-Mississippi...

- Alan?
- What?

...two-Mississippi.

Oh, God.

Okay, we're all caught up.

Wait, you're dating Phil?
How can you be dating Phil?

Alan, he asked me out.

What about the whole gay thing?
Did you even give that a chance?

Phil, we'd better go.

Hey, look, Alan, I hope this doesn't
affect our friendship.

- No. Call me, we'll hang out.
- Great. Hey, how's Tuesday?

Tuesday's good.
Judith, how's Tuesday for you?

Just walk away.

I know you built your sundeck
without a permit and I am calling it in.

Alan, chill.

That two-faced, wife-poaching,
soccer-coaching, rat-bastard!

Come on, let it go.

- I'll treat you to a cherry slurpy.
- I don't want a cherry slurpy.

Are you sure?
'Cause I think Phil's gonna get one.

What does she think she's doing?

She's straight, she's gay,
she's straight again.

Place your bets.
Where she lands, nobody knows.

Alan, it's no big deal.

Women get to experiment
with their sexuality.

It's only guys who have to make a choice
and stick to it.

- Where do you get this stuff?
- I make it up.

Anyway,
it doesn't matter what Judith is.

- It only matters what she's not.
- And what is she not?

She is not coming back to you, pal.

Thank you for your sensitivity.

All I'm saying is, is that Judith has
moved on with her life,

and maybe it's time for you
to do the same.

I know. It's just... I can't.

- Sure you can. I'll help you.
- How?

I don't know, by saying things like,
"Sure you can. I'll help you. "

Great, thanks.

Look,
this isn't just about you, you know?

All this wallowing in the past
is causing other people to suffer.

- You mean Jake.
- I mean me.

You are really starting to piss me off.

Okay, that's enough help for now.

I'm saying maybe it's time
to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

- You're right, I know you're right.
- Forget Judith.

There's a whole world out there
that you haven't pissed off yet.

There is no reason I couldn't
find happiness with someone else.

There you go.

This could be the beginning
of the rest of my life.

A bit of a bumper sticker,
but sure, why not?

In fact, for the first time since college,
I can go after any woman I want.

Heck, I could take a page from your book

- and date them two, three at a time.
- Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, right.

You know what?
I'm gonna start right now.

I am gonna die alone.

No.

You just don't know how to sell yourself.
Give me a minute.

- So?
- If it was up to them, you'd die alone.

- Great.
- Okay, here's the thing.

If you want to play in this league,
you have to make a few changes.

- Like what?
- Hang on.

- Pretty much everything.
- Everything?

Yep. The hair, the clothes,
the fuddy-duddy personality.

What do they know about my personality?

Okay, that part's mine.

Face it, Alan, you've
been an old fart since you were 14.

What is that supposed to mean?

It means, how many eighth-graders
carry a briefcase and a pocket watch?

That was the Esperanto Club look.

Unless you know where
all the hot Esperanto chicks hang out,

you're gonna need
to shake things up a little.

Really? And how to do I go about
"shaking things up"?

Hang on.

This may take a while. Don't wait up.

Hey, guess what?

Coach Phil made me first-string
on the soccer team.

- Is that so?
- Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I suck.

Maybe Coach Phil sees some potential.

- So, what else is new?
- Mom's got new clothes and new hair.

It's like she's a different person
or something.

- But she's still the same person, Jake.
- No, not really.

She walks around the house
singing all the time.

- She just sings for no reason?
- I guess.

I wonder if it's the same reason
I sing for no reason.

Does Coach Phil sing for no reason?

For God's sake, Charlie!

How come
you haven't changed anything yet, Dad?

- Why should I change?
- So you'd look cool like Mom.

- You don't think I look cool now?
- No.

You know what,
it doesn't matter if I look cool,

we judge a person by what's inside them,
not by what they wear.

Lucky for you.

Yeah, lucky.

- I'm done. Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

Help me, Charlie.
I want to sing for no reason.

Get your jacket. It's time to go.

I don't want to go.
I hate clothes shopping.

- You can't stay here alone.
- Why not?

You know why not.

But you don't have a turtle
to put in the microwave anymore.

- Get your jacket.
- Fine.

I'll put on my stupid jacket,
we'll get in the stupid car,

and we'll go stupid clothes shopping.

Hey, don't talk
to your stupid father like that.

- So, you ready for your big makeover?
- You know what? Actually, I am.

- I was up all night thinking about it.
- All night?

Maybe your money's better spent
on a hooker.

No, listen,

I was in the bathroom,
looking at myself in the mirror,

when I noticed, and I think I can be
completely objective about this,

that I have a very nice ass
for a guy my age.

And I think I should start dressing
in such a way as to play that card.

You know, for the ladies.

Go ahead, check it out.

Am I lying?

- Hi, Mom.
- Good, you remember me.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Hey, Mom, right?

Very cute. I was in the neighborhood,
I thought I'd stop by.

I'm sorry, Mom. We were just leaving.

It never fails, does it?

Whenever I would like to spend
some quality time with my grandson

there's always something
more important going on.

It's not fair, you know.

I'm not getting clothes,
so why do I have to go and be bored?

You don't,
you can stay here with Grandma.

- What?
- What?

- Have fun.
- Wait, no, I'll be good, I swear.

Payback's a bitch, buddy.

- This department looks nice.
- You're sure?

Because this is the top floor.
There's no more clothes above this floor.

- No, I have a good feeling about this floor.
- Great.

- How about this shirt?
- No, I don't think so.

Okay.

- How about this?
- No.

Good.

- This one?
- No.

- This?
- No.

Tell you what,
why don't you pick something?

- I thought you were gonna help me?
- Pick something.

Okay, flying solo.

This is something
I could see myself wearing.

- You like this?
- Yeah.

Let me see that.

Please, if she has one more facelift,
she'll be wearing her ass as a hat.

Jake, honey,

turn the TV down,
Grandmommy's on the telephone.

I'm sorry, what?

No, I'm just spending
a little quality time with my grandson.

He's an amazing boy.
We're very close, two peas in a pod.

What? Hold on.

Jake, how old are you?

- Ten.
- Seven.

I said, "Ten. "

If I'm 55, you're seven.

He's an adorable boy,
and he just loves me so much.

Jake, tell my friend, Cheryl,
how much you love Grandmommy.

Go on, darling.

I'm 10.

How's it going in there?

Whatever happened to zippers?
I miss zippers.

I don't know, Alan.
Maybe there were too many injuries.

Nobody ever got their balls
caught in a buttonhole.

- Come on out, let's see.
- I'm just not sure about this.

We're never gonna find the right
look for you unless we experiment.

Now, let's see.

I'm not happy with visible nipples.

Yeah, that's what is wrong with it.

That's it. We need a gay guy.

His name is Sponge Bob Square Pants,
and his friend's name is Patrick.

He's a starfish, and he lives
on the same street Sponge Bob,

and he's unbelievably dumb.
Squidward lives there, too.

Of course, he's a squid
and he hates Sponge Bob,

and he plays the clarinet.

Both Squidward and Sponge Bob
work at the Crusty Krab for Mr. Krab,

who's really cheap,
but Sponge Bob doesn't care

because he just likes being
a fry cook and making Krabby...

So, bottom line,

he's a sponge?

Yeah.

His pants are square 'cause he's square
and so is his underwear.

They're tighty-whities,
but they're square.

- Oh, dear God.
- He has a pet snail named Gary, that...

Okay, relax the shoulders, good.
The style suits you,

the pants hang beautifully. Oh, dear.

What?

You're not gonna
be wearing those shoes, are you?

- Say no.
- No.

Could you show us some shoes
that will go with this?

I'm sorry, I don't actually work here.
I came in for a belt.

Okay, we got an outfit.
Let's go find some shoes.

No, Charlie,
I'm done. I can't do this anymore.

Don't worry. I'm sure there'll
be a gay guy in the shoe department.

No, I've changed my mind.
I don't want new clothes.

What? You look great.
That guy said you looked stunning.

He said "fabulous,"
but that's not the point.

- This is not who I am.
- Yeah.

But who you are couldn't get laid
underwater with a tank full of oxygen.

- Forget it, let's just go home.
- Wait a second.

I spend all day schlepping
from store to store with you,

listening to you whine,
and now that we finally found

- something that works, you want to bail?
- I don't feel comfortable in this stuff.

- I knew it. I knew you'd chicken out.
- Chicken out?

I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

At least your wife
had the guts to try something new.

Don't go there, Charlie.

I mean, the soccer coach
was kind of a sideways move,

- but you gotta admire the effort.
- Fine.

I will buy the stupid clothes,
but I'm never ever

- going to do this with you again.
- Promise?

I just hope he's worth all the drama.

Hello. Mom, Jake?

In here.

Hello.

- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Alan.

- Rose, what are you doing here?
- Babysitting.

- Where's my mother?
- She left.

- Why?
- I don't know.

We were watching
Sponge Bob Square Pants,

and she stood up and said,
"Life was too short. "

Luckily,
I happened to be out on the deck,

not doing anything, just passing by,

and she asked me to baby-sit.

- Dad, you look cool.
- Really? You think?

Yeah, very sexy.

So where is Charlie?

He dropped me off.
We had a little disagreement.

Was it about those dorky shoes?

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Mind if I join you?
- Might as well.

You're gonna have to drive me home.

I just wanted to say that
I know you were just trying to help,

and I appreciate it.

Thanks.

I just got a little panicky.
Change is not easy for me, Charlie.

Really? I hadn't noticed.

And I'm not just talking about
the clothes.

The clothes are only the
tip of the iceberg.

Only the tip of the iceberg.

Leanne, I'm gonna need another shot.

- Continue.
- Yeah, it's like,

I was married a long time, Charlie.

It's who I was, it was my identity,

"Married Guy," "Husband Man,"
"Captain Dependable,"

and I had a uniform.

And, I don't know, I guess,
I just didn't want to take it off.

'Cause you'd lose your powers
of dependability?

- So, Charlie, who's your friend?
- My brother, Alan.

Hi, Alan. I'm Leanne.
It's nice to meet you.

I've actually met you a bunch of times.

No, I'd remember you.

I come in here with Charlie all the time,
I always order a rum and Diet Coke?

Right.

So, Alan, the usual?

No, today let's try something different.

- Charlie, what are you having?
- Tequila shooters with a beer back.

Great. I will have a rum and Diet Coke.

You've got it, hon.

Was she flirting with me?
I think she was flirting with me.

I think there was definitely a
connection.

Alan, you do understand
she works for tips?

- Rum and Diet Coke, please?
- Here.

- Did you see that?
- What do you expect?

You bought a sport jacket,
not a magic lamp.

Hello.

I didn't see you back there.

Oh, yeah.

I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

.......... ********** ..........

Well, Judith,
you can't have it both ways.

No, if you want to stay in that house,

and drive that car,
then I have to live here to save money.

No. I don't agree that
he's a bad influence on Jake.

Uncle Charlie,
I understand the point spread,

but I'm still confused about the vig.

Okay.

Vig is short for vigorish,
and it means the percentage you pay

- to a bookie to take your bet.
- So it's better to be a bookie.

My little boy is growing up.

Judith, hang on.

I have got to stop you here,
because right at this very minute,

I am watching Charlie
help Jake with math.

Well, go ahead and call your lawyers, but
I think I am well within my rights here.

Well, I don't know what Jake is telling
you about Charlie's dates,

but he is a kid,
and he blows things out of proportion.

Well, if by nude swimming you mean,

she had no bathing suit on whatsoever,

then that never happened.

I can see the clothes hamper
was a wise purchase.

- Berta?
- No, it's Liz Hurley, but I'm holding water.

I'm still sleeping here.
Could you come back in a little while?

I could,
or you could get your pampered ass

out of bed
and let me do my demeaning job

and get on with my hellish life.

Excuse me, Berta, but last time I checked,
you work for me.

So I'll get up when I'm good and ready.

Sorry I had to pull rank on you.

- Berta, for God's sake!
- Hey, do you want clean towels?

- But I'm trying to do something here.
- So do it.

Well, I can't do it now.

Is something wrong?

I mean, beyond the usual
demeaning-job hellish-life stuff?

Do you really want to know?

No, but I'm up and my bed's gone.

Okay. So I told you
about my daughter, right?

- You have a daughter?
- I have three.

Three? Wow.

You gotta start learning to say no,
little lady.

Hey, Berta. Morning.

Now, you know I hate to criticize,
but the coffee filters you've been buying

have chemicals in them.

And I love it!

Get out of my way.

- What's wrong with her?
- Apparently she has children.

And one of them showed up last night
and left her little girl,

who I have to drag with me everywhere

because I can't leave her alone
in the house.

- So you brought her here?
- Yeah.

Is that gonna be a problem?

- No.
- That's wonderful.

- Happy to have her.
- Yeah.

- So where is she?
- She's playing with Jake.

Good. A little playmate for Jake.

That'll give him something to do
for today.

I hope they're quiet
'cause I got a lot of work to do.

Nana, did you throw out
my cigarettes again?

- Dear God!
- Oh, hell!

Prudence, you're 16 years old.

You want to end up on a breathing
machine like your Uncle Chick?

- Mom lets me smoke.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

No reason I shouldn't trust
the judgment of a woman

who's off selling bootleg Metallica
t-shirts at a monster truck rally.

Mom sounds like a real go-getter.

So what am I supposed to do
here all day?

You're supposed to help me clean,
that's what. Here.

You can start with his toilet.

Hi.

- I'm Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

What kind of car do you drive?

- A Volvo station wagon.
- What do you got?

I got nothing. Not a damn thing.

Hey, Prudence, I set up my Xbox.
You ready to play?

- Sure.
- Get to work, Prudence!

Maybe later, handsome.
Stupid old woman.

Isn't she wonderful?

- Dear God.
- Oh, hell.

Well,
I'd better get started on that work

I have... to do.

Yeah, I gotta catch up on some
paperwork that

has to do with the office.

- Oh, yeah. Your job.
- Yeah.

Your chiropractor job.

Yeah and you'll be, what,
you'll be writing a jingle?

Yeah. Potato chips. You know, the...

The ones in the can.

Yeah.

I like those.

All right, then.

- I'm gonna go over to the piano now.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna go to the

kitchen and... Yeah.

Hey, you play piano?

Yes.

You're pretty good.

Thanks.

- Are you in a band?
- No.

I used to go out with a bass player.
He wrote this beautiful song for me,

called Dear Prudence.

Yeah, that sounds like something
a bass player would do.

You know, I've always wanted
to play the piano.

Do you think you could
teach me something?

Nope, nothing, not a damn thing.

So, do you have a girlfriend?

Me? Oh, yeah. Big-time girlfriend.

We're practically engaged.

Prudence, he's old enough
to be your father.

And knowing your mother, he might be.

- Just wash the damn windows.
- I'm not your father.

How do you stand her?
She's such a bitch.

Don't talk like that
about your grandmother.

Hey, you don't know her.
She's all sweet and nice with you.

Yeah.

She's a real gumdrop.

My point is, you've gotta respect her
because she loves you and

I've seen her pick up the stove
to vacuum under it.

Oh, hey, look!

There's Rose, my girlfriend.

Come on in, baby.

Okay.

Rose, this is Berta's 16-year-old
granddaughter, Prudence.

Prudence, this is my girlfriend, who I'm
free to take across state lines, Rose.

- Wow, look at that kiss!
- What?

Oh, thank God.

Berta, does Prudence have a boyfriend?

Oh, honey, don't get me started.

What does that mean?

It means if she gets a high-school
diploma before she gets a baby,

she'll be the first one in the family.

I'm thirsty. What's to drink?

The Cransylvania Goofy Juice is mine,
but you can have one.

Oh, thanks, handsome.

Is this beer for anybody?

- Prudence, you're 16.
- You know, Prudence,

the Goofy Juice has vitamin C
and calcium.

It's much better than beer
for a growing body.

Not that your body needs to grow.

I'm done.

You know, Prudence,
I'm the third fastest runner in my class.

- Cool!
- Spring break's over. Back to work.

Later, stud.

Boy, she smells good.

Yeah, if you like Camel Filters
and pheromones.

I gotta do some grocery shopping
for your brother.

I'll be back in a little while.

- What about Prudence?
- She'll be fine.

Just keep her out of the liquor cabinet.

Don't do anything stupid
or you'll go to jail.

- Why would you go to jail?
- Well, that's kind of complicated.

And why was Uncle Charlie kissing Rose?

- Well, that was the...
- And what are pherobones?

That one I know,
and it's pronounced pheromones...

Never mind.

Wow, you're really good at that.

Thanks. I took some cosmetology courses.

I figure I'll be a beautician,
or a supermodel.

Cool.

- You want another Goofy Juice?
- Aren't you the sweetest.

That's twice he's done that.

You gotta admit,
she did a nice job on those windows.

Jake, you need to get started
on that book report.

- But Prudence is thirsty.
- I'll take care of Prudence.

- Come on, get going.
- Man!

- Charlie, you want to...
- Not a chance in hell.

Remember when you used to say that
about us?

- Here.
- Thanks.

Where's my little pal?

- He has work to do. Kind of like you.
- Are you gonna tell on me?

No, it was just...

Just an observation.

Just calling them as I see them.

Glean from it what you will.

- What are you talking about?
- I'm not really sure anymore.

But I do want you to know that

I understand how angry
and powerless you feel.

Believe it or not,
I was a teenager once, too.

And I can remember what it's like
to rebel against parental authority.

Or in your case,
grandparental authority.

- Can you put some of this on my back?
- No.

If you don't, I'll burn.

If I do, I will.

- Judith. What a surprise.
- Hello, Charlie.

So,

- what's new?
- Where's Jake?

In his room, doing a book report.

Well, how can he do a book report
when he left the book at my house?

That little dickens.
Trying to pull the wool over our eyes.

- I'll take care of this right now. Bye.
- Charlie, I want to see Jake.

Sure. Hang on.

Jake? Your mother's here!

- What?
- Your mom's here. Talk to your mom.

- Here he is.
- Hi, Mom.

Hi, sweetie.
Are you having a fun weekend?

You know Berta,
Uncle Charlie's housekeeper...

Of course she knows her.
Who doesn't know Berta?

- She brought her granddaughter over.
- Yeah. Sweet little kid.

That's nice.
Have you been playing with her?

Oh, yeah. I mean, he has. Not me.

Hey, Judith. What's up?

Well, it turns out this little rascal
was pulling a fast one on us.

Doing a book report without the book.

Oh, Jake. All right, young man,
you get to work right now.

- Jake?
- Oh, yeah.

So, thanks for stopping by.

I guess I'll see you
when you come to pick him up.

- What's going on here?
- Nothing. What?

Oh, hi, Judith.

Did you hear the good news?
Charlie and I are back together.

Oh, really?

Yep. That's what's going on here.

Well, just show a little discretion
in front of my son, Charlie.

Absolutely.

- You got that, Rose? Discretion.
- Got it, Monkey Man.

I think I have a concussion.

Thanks for helping me
with my book report, Prudence.

Oh, no problem.
Fourth-grade stuff is easy for me.

Should be, you did it twice.

Let's go before we miss the bus.

- Later, handsome.
- Bye.

So, what are we doing tonight, sweetie?

Rose, I really appreciate your help,

but you don't have to pretend
to be my girlfriend anymore.

Oh, no.

Are you pretending to break up with me?

2:00 in the morning. This better be God.

Oh, God.

Hey.

Prudence, what the hell
are you doing here?

- I had a fight with my grandmother.
- So?

When I have a fight with my grandmother,
I don't come to your house.

I know, I'm sorry.
I just didn't know where else to go

and I thought you were cool.

Look, Prudence, this just can't happen.

I mean, you're very nice and pretty,
but in prison, so am I.

Bitching house, man.
You should rent it to MTV.

- Who the hell are you?
- What's going on?

Put down the toothbrush, Alan, we've got
bigger problems than gingivitis.

What's she doing here?
Who the hell is this?

This is Freddie. My fiancé.

- 'Sup.
- 'Sup?

I'll tell you what's 'sup. I'm 'sup.

And I should be seeping. Sleeping.

What's going on here?

Well, Freddie came over to announce
our engagement, and Nana threw him out.

Really? She didn't take a shine
to Bazooka Joe here?

You know,
I'm kind of more of an acquired taste.

So we just need a place to crash tonight

because tomorrow we're gonna go
to Vegas and get married.

- Oh, Prudence, that's a terrible idea.
- Yeah.

If you leave right now,
you can beat the traffic.

We can't go tonight.

He's gotta pick up his last paycheck
from the photomat.

Yeah, $218.

I'll give you $300 to leave right now.

- Charlie, we can't let them go.
- Why not?

Because they're stupid and they'll die.

- What's going on?
- Hey, handsome.

- Who's he?
- This is Freddie, my fiancé.

- You're marrying him?
- Freddie, this is Jake.

'Sup.

Charlie, I saw the lights come on,
is everything okay?

Yeah, Rose, everything's fine.

She's your girlfriend
but she doesn't sleep here?

Yeah, what's up with that, Charlie?

- I told you they'd be here.
- Come here, you little snot bubble.

What do you think you're doing
with my baby girl?

Mom, leave him alone! I love him.

Give me a break, Prudence.
You're 16 years old,

and your hormones are doing
all your thinking for you.

Hi, you must be Charlie.

Hi.

- That's it, we're outta here.
- But, Mom...

- Grandma!
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

- Can I at least give him my number?
- He's got your number, sweetheart.

I guess I'll take the couch.

Okay, I'm going!

Don't you ever come back!

Ready for bed, lamb chop?

It was worth a shot.

- Is Mom here yet?
- No.

- Sit down a minute, Jake, okay?
- Did I do something wrong?

No.

- We just want to talk.
- Okay. What do you want to talk about?

Well, you know how I've always told
you that you should always tell

your parents the truth, no matter what?

Well, forget it.

Charlie. Jake, it's just that...

We're just saying a lot of things
happened here this weekend,

and it's not really necessary
that your mother know about them.

So you want me to lie?

No, it's not really lying.

When a boy becomes a man,

and that's what you're becoming.

- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, a man.

He has to start protecting the women
in his life from certain things.

Like the truth.

Do you understand?

I think so.
You don't want Mom to know about

Prudence and her boyfriend
and everything.

Good man.

- Hi, Judith.
- Hello, Alan.

- Charlie.
- Judith.

- You ready to go, sweetheart?
- Yep.

How was your weekend?

Uncle Charlie says I don't
have to tell you.

.......... ********** ..........

Here, try this.

- What is it?
- Just try it.

Hey, that's good.

Of course it is.
It's chicken in frumunda sauce.

Frumunda sauce?

Yeah, from unda' the toilet.

Get it, Dad?

Yeah, I get it. I got it 30 years ago,
the first time he said it.

Yeah, but it's new to him.

Check this out. Hey, Jake?

What do you call the red mushy stuff
between the elephant's toes?

- What?
- Slow-moving natives.

I love this kid.
He's a comedy blank slate.

I'm glad you do, but you might not
want to share your chopsticks with him.

- I think he's coming down with something.
- Oh, no.

He thinks it's a head cold
but it's snot.

Wait a minute,
you don't know that one, either?

I have so much to teach you,
grasshopper.

Do you know how to make arm farts?

Charlie? Not at the dinner table.

I'll show you later.

Before I forget,
you got plans for tomorrow night?

- No.
- Make some.

- I'm gonna need the house to myself.
- Fine.

Don't you want to know why?

Jake, if you're done, you can go
to your room and start your homework.

This is about sex, right?

Kids today, huh?

Doesn't know frumunda sauce
but gets why I need the house.

I got a bunch of jokes
you're gonna love in a year or two.

- Cool!
- Go.

You think I'm just a kid but I'm snot.

Wait, that's not right.

Okay, have you ever had revenge sex?

Hang on. Jake, are you in your room?

Yeah!

Revenge sex.
Is that anything like pity sex?

Whole different animal.

Let me break it down for you.

There's this woman, Kathy,
who lives up the beach.

Beautiful woman, I've wanted her
for years. Only one problem.

She's married to kind of
a friend of mine.

Kind of a friend?

Well, I never really liked him,
but he had a hot wife.

So, the sanctity of marriage
does slow you down a bit.

- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

But then I catch a break.

He cheats on her with her best friend.

She throws him out. So now I'm thinking
she is gonna want justice.

Justice meaning revenge sex with you?

You see it, too, huh?

You're gonna exploit someone's anger and
grief for your own animal gratification.

Hey, I don't bitch about your hobbies.

She's coming over here on Sunday,
so I want you to be out of the way,

because we'll probably be moving
from room to room.

I'll catch a movie.
Just mop up when you're done.

You got it.

Don't take things off his plate.
He's coming down with something.

Relax. I never get sick.

Boy, is he sick.

Well, I can't say he didn't warn me.

How you feeling?

Horrible.

- Is that tea?
- Yeah.

I know I said I wanted you
out of the house for my date tonight,

but you're obviously indisposed,
so don't worry about it.

Thank you.

Just stay in your room so the coughing
and hacking doesn't kill the mood.

Anything else I can do
to enhance your evening?

Well, you know how to
work my camcorder?

I'm bored. What are we gonna do today?

I don't know. Why don't we make
some lunch and figure something out?

- Cool.
- Excuse me?

Hasn't anybody noticed
I'm sick and miserable here?

Yes, Alan, we noticed.

Which is why we're gonna make
like hockey players

and get the puck out of here.

Get it, Dad? Puck's not a bad word,
but it sounds like one.

Yeah, hilarious.

Hey, Uncle Charlie, let's make like
soccer players and get our big

leather balls out of here.

Good one.

You know, I caught this from you.
How come you're not sick?

I am. See?

He's just not being a baby about it.

- Hi.
- Perfect.

Rose, this isn't the best time.
Alan's pretty sick.

Oh, no!

Poor Alan.
Is Charlie taking good care of you?

Not really.

Would you like me to take care of you?

Not really.

Don't be silly. Move over.

Rose, what are you doing?

I'm transmitting healing energy
from my body to yours.

Looks like you're in good hands.
Come on, Jake.

I don't think that's gonna help him.

No, but it helps us.

Is he gonna be able to take me
back to Mom's later?

Don't worry. If he can't, I will.

Hey, how can you tell if an elephant's
been in your refrigerator?

- How?
- There's footprints in the cheesecake.

But we don't have a cheesecake.

That's the part you don't buy?

Do you feel the healing energy?

If I say yes, will you get off me?

- Hello?
- Mom?

For God's sake, Alan,
I sit on that couch.

Mom, I'm sick.

We're all sick, darling,
but we use discretion.

No, he has the flu, Evelyn.

You poor baby.
What can Mommy do for you?

It's okay. I'll manage.

Don't be ridiculous.
Now what do you need?

I don't know. I am kind of thirsty.

Well, then,
you should be drinking lots of fluids.

Okay.

Would you like a nice hot bowl
of my special chicken noodle soup?

That would be nice.

Rose, call Greenblatt's
and have them send over some soup.

As a matter of fact, I'm famished.
Order me...

Order me a turkey on rye
with maybe a little Swiss.

On second thought, delivery takes forever.
Would you care to join me for lunch?

Well, what about Alan?

We'll have something sent back for him.

Okay.

So, what's Charlie been up to?

Well, what do you know about
revenge sex?

Quite a bit, actually.

I'm still thirsty.

Hey. Looking good.

That's not very hygienic.
We wash dishes in that sink.

Well, somebody does.

Did the chicken soup Mom sent over
from Greenblatt's ever show up?

Nope.

Well, I'm glad you got some rest,
because I have got great news.

There is no great news.

There's no light at the
end of the tunnel.

There is no silver lining.

There is just this hell on earth.

And the slow wait
for the sweet release of death.

Okay. Let's call it good news.

The girl I'm going out with tonight
needs a date for her sister.

Are you insane?

No,
but I hear the sister's a bit of a freak.

Jake? Jake, go to your room.

If you want to talk about sex,
why don't you go to your room?

- Now!
- Fine.

First of all, I don't want to talk
about dating in front of my son

while his mother and I
are in the middle of a divorce.

Okay. That's very caring and sensitive.

Now let me tell you about
Revenge Sex's little sister, Casual.

Alright, even if I weren't deathly ill,
which I am,

I wouldn't go on a blind double date
with you.

- Why not?
- Summer of my junior year?

The Seals and Crofts concert?

You got the incredible cheerleader and
I got her sister, The Incredible Hulk?

She really took a shine to you.

Sure did. "Sarah like puny Alan. "

You weren't complaining
when you were on her shoulders

shouting Summer Breeze!

Forget it, Charlie, forget it.

Alan, trust me. I've seen the sister.
Her name is Desiree.

I don't care what her name is.

Desiree, Alan. That's like desire
with a "yay" at the end.

- She's an actress on some soap opera.
- Really, which one?

I don't know.
The Bold and the Bulimic, or something.

Are you guys done yet?

Yeah, we're done.

Now we're gonna get your father
back on his feet.

How?

Well,

would you like to go see a bunch
of naked boobs?

- Sure!
- Charlie!

This was a dirty trick, Uncle Charlie.

So we just sit here and be hot?

Yep.

This sucks.

That's good. Get it out now,
because most women hate that noise.

I'm not going on a date, Charlie.

You don't know that.

I didn't start this day thinking we'd
all be sitting bare-ass naked,

but here we are.

Hey, Dad, want to hear a funny joke?

Sure, why not?

Okay, there's a priest,
a minister, and a rabbit.

It's a rabbi, Jake.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

A priest, a minister, and a rabbi.

I forgot the rest.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

Wait.

You know why they call this
a European health spa?

Because you're a-peein'.

He's gonna kill at school tomorrow.

Charlie, I'm not going on a date.

Oh, come on, Alan.

If you don't do this, then I'm not
gonna get the revenge sex.

And I really want the revenge sex.
I really do.

I'm sorry.
It's not that I don't appreciate you,

pimping me out on my deathbed.

It's just that I'm not ready to date.

Not ready?

If you think you're protecting Jake
by living like a monk, you're wrong.

He needs to know that his father's moving
on with his life, that he's happy.

It's not about Jake.
I haven't been on a date since college.

There's nothing to worry about.
Just be yourself.

The one woman who knows me better
than anyone in the world threw me out.

So "be yourself"
is not exactly comforting advice.

Good point.

Okay, look at it this way.

It took your wife 12 years
to get sick of you.

All we gotta do here
is snow some broad for one night.

A priest, a minister, and a rabbi
walk into a barn.

It's a bar, Jake. Not a barn. A bar.

It is?

Now I get it. That's funny.

Okay, I dropped Jake off at his mom's,

and the girls should be here
in a little while for drinks.

Is this the sister?

Desiree Barrington from
The Young and the Restless?

Yeah.

You want me to go on a date
with Desiree Barrington?

Yeah.

I'm healed. It's a miracle.

Attaboy.

Are you okay?

Yeah. Why?

Well, you're coughing, you're sweating.

Charlie, you're burning up.

No, your hand is freezing.

I think you're coming down
with what I've got.

Don't be ridiculous. I never get sick.

Now, listen, I made reservations
at the Ivy.

I figure we'll take them out
for an early dinner and then...

And then what?

Hang on a second.

Anyway, we'll take them to the Ivy...

Here. This'll make you feel better.

Thanks.

Okay.

Why don't you go upstairs and change

because we really want to look our best
for our dates.

What are you talking about?
I'm not going on a date.

Yeah, you are.

Come on, Charlie. Desiree Barrington.

Nominated for two Daytime Emmys.

Named "Most Promising Ingénue"
by Soap Opera Digest.

She totally revitalized
Young and the Restless.

Occasionally I have lunch at my desk
and watch a little TV.

Tell Jake I loved him.

Please, Charlie.
I was gonna suck it up for you.

No, you weren't.

Okay, you got me.

Look, you helped me feel better,

and now I'll help you.

You want to help me, Alan?

Find a gun and shoot me in the eye.

No, I was thinking I could give you
a chiropractic adjustment.

You could also do my hair,
but what would be the point?

Chiropractics
is not just about back ailments.

It's a holistic approach
to wellness that includes

unblocking pathways
in the nervous system

so that the body can heal itself.

Excuse me? What is...

Alan. I never told you this before,

but I guess now is as
good a time as any.

I think what you do for a living
is a total crock.

What?

Don't take it personally.

But you chiropractor guys are just

masseuses without the happy endings,
right?

You think I'm some kind of phony?

That my profession is some kind of con?

Well, let's be honest.

You only became a chiropractor because
you couldn't get into medical school.

I got into medical school!

I just didn't want to spend four years
in Guadalajara.

So instead you spent, what,
two weeks at Back Snapper U?

It was two years.

And since we're being honest,

Let me tell you about what I think about
what you do, Mr. Jingle Writer.

You're not a musician, you're a salesman.
You know what you sell?

Crap!

Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?
Maple Loops?

Hey, Maple Loops is part of a
nutritious, balanced breakfast.

Yeah, if you eat it with a steak
and some broccoli.

And let me tell you another thing.
You had a shot at a real career.

You could've played in great bands.

You could've been a respected
studio musician.

Don't you think I wanted that?

I tried, Alan, and I failed.

The truth is, if I hadn't started
writing jingles, I'd be playing

faculty mixers
at the Guadalajara Medical School.

Since you're being honest,
I guess I can admit,

I didn't really get into Guadalajara.

I guess neither of us is doing exactly
what we dreamed about when we were kids.

I guess not.

But you know,
we could be doing a lot worse.

Yes, we could.

Excuse me.

You know what's nice, though?

This. Right now.

Taking care of each other,
like we did when we were kids.

Well, no one else was gonna
take care of us.

- We were on our own.
- Yeah.

Dad was gone and Mom was...

What are you doing? Hey!

How do you feel?

Actually, a little better.

Total crock, huh?
Lay down, I'll do your back.

- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- No, really, it'll help.

I mean it, Alan.
Keep your hands away from me.

Come on, don't be such a baby.

I'm not a baby.
I just don't like a man touching me.

I let you do it to me once,
that was enough.

And you liked it. Now come on,
just let me finish the job,

and you'll be ready
for when the women get here.

- No.
- Just relax. Come on.

Wait. Car doors.

They're here.

How do I look?

Good. Me?

Very nice.

Thank you.

Was that the doorbell?

Alan, relax. Chicks are always late.

I guess.

What about that?

- What about what?
- The doorbell.

Alan, relax. Chicks are always late.

I guess.

Now, that was the doorbell.

.......... ********** ..........

The kick is up, it's long enough.

The kick is no good.

Yes!

- Yeah!
- Who won?

Who cares? We covered the spread.

Charlie, call me an old-fashioned dad,

but I was hoping my son
wouldn't start betting on sports

until he was old enough
to have a drinking problem.

He didn't really make a bet.
I just gave him a taste of my action.

Nor do I want him tasting your action.

Dad, without action, there's no juice.

All of a sudden he's Frank Sinatra.

- I bet that's the pizza.
- What's the spread?

Pepperoni.

What's next, Charlie?
You gonna teach him how to shoot craps?

He already knows how to shoot craps.

I just wish I could teach him
not to bet the hard eight.

Mr. Harper, here you go, nice and hot.
I threw in some extra garlic puffs as well.

Thanks, pal.

Thank you, Mr. Harper.

If there's anything at all you ever need,
please call.

You know, pizza, dry-cleaning,
pot, women.

- How much did you tip him?
- I don't know, I gave him $50.

That's like a 300% tip.

If you say so. I was never good at math.

Yeah, but you can figure out
the point spread, the over-under

and the vigorish
on every football game in the country.

What can I tell you?
I've got a beautiful mind.

Morning, Berta. Need some help?

Yeah. Come to my house
and explain to my daughter

that we don't put up bail for cute guys
with Costa Rican passports.

- Morning.
- I got your groceries, Charlie.

You owe me $74.

- Why didn't you just use my credit card?
- I tried.

Funny story.

My platinum card.

Look what they did to my platinum card.

They decapitated my holographic eagle.

Yeah, that's sad. You owe me $74.

Relax, I'll write you a check.

Berta, I'm good for $74.

There's an assistant store manager
with bad skin and a pair of scissors

who begs to differ.

He obviously made a mistake.
Leave it to me, I'll straighten it out.

Alan, what do I do?

Call the bank that issued the card
and figure out what's going on.

Good idea.

How do I get the number?

It's usually on the back of the card.

Okay, this may take a while.

Are you sure?

Okay, thanks.

I don't believe it.

None of my bills have been paid
in four months.

My credit is shot.
All my cards are dead.

You don't have to worry
about paying me this week.

Thank you, Berta.

I'll just take this espresso maker
and be on my way.

Call me when things pick up.

Charlie, why haven't you been
paying your bills?

Alan, I don't pay my own bills.
I've got a guy.

Do you think you might want
to call your guy?

Don't talk down to me, Alan.
I'm not stupid.

That's the first call I made.

- And?
- And

his number is not in service
at this time.

Wonderful building.

What's wrong with it?

The phrase "reeks of urine"
comes to mind.

Here we are.

That's seldom a good sign.

- Hello, Stan?
- Who wants to know?

It's Charlie Harper.

Charlie! Good to see you. Come on in.

Just don't rip the tape, they check.

So what's going on?
What can I do you for?

Stan, I've got a problem.

Yeah, I know the feeling.

Sit down, talk to me. Come on.

All of my credit cards are dead.

And they tell me the bills
haven't been paid in four months.

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Excuse me,
maybe this is none of my business,

but how does something like that happen?

In layman's terms,
your brother ran out of money.

What? How did I run out of money?

I knew you'd ask that.

Let me demonstrate.

Think of this water as cash flow,

which, for you, would be
royalties from your jingles, right?

And this cup, your financial well-being.

This little hole

would be your expenses. You dig?

Now, Charlie, with most people,

when money comes in,

it drips out and pays their bills

with a healthy reserve for emergencies.

But with you, however...
This is what I love about you, Charlie.

You spend it as quick as you get it.

You see, you don't drip,

you hemorrhage.

Look at that.

But when the cash flow
starts to slow down,

there's no reserve.

Okay.

But what happened to my money?

Artists. Where would we be
without them?

What I don't understand is why
you didn't warn him this was happening.

Okay, mea culpa.

Look, I've been a little distracted lately.
Slight problem with the feds.

Are you embezzling from my brother?

Embezzle what? Hello!

I thought you were the smart one.

No, this is a totally unrelated,

import-export problem, all right?

I just cannot believe that one of
the piñatas showed up at a kids' party.

Oh, boy.

This has been a blast.
Don't get me wrong,

but I have a plane to catch right now.

I'll tell you what, just feel free
and browse through all your files.

Listen, Charlie, I'm running a little
short on cash, so maybe you...

Look who I'm asking!

It was great meeting you, sport. Ciao.

And you were worried.

The good news is
that a substantial amount of royalties

is gonna come in
in the next couple of months.

Great. Problem solved.
Let's go out to dinner.

- No, problem not solved.
- But I'm hungry.

Get used to it.

It's going to take a while to pay off
all the bills your accountant ignored,

so until then,
you're gonna have to cut back.

- But you said I got money coming.
- Shall I go get the paper cup?

Okay. What do we cut?

Let's look at your expenses.

First thing is,
we stop paying your accountant.

That's a little cold, isn't it?

He's great, I've known him for years.
He's going through a rough patch.

- Charlie, you're broke.
- You're right, screw him.

What's next?

You have a gardener.
Why do you have a gardener?

To tend my garden.

Garden? You mean the two potted palms
on the deck?

Water them yourself.

Okay, but I'm gonna have to buy a hose
and one of those watering things,

so isn't that kind of a push?

Gone. Now,
"Ultimate Premiere Satellite package"?

That's really cool.
I get every sporting event in the world.

If a kid in Madagascar throws a rock
at a tree, I can see it and bet on it.

It's gone.

Oh, man.
We can keep the cable, though, right?

You have satellite and cable?

Sometimes there's solar flares.

Okay, we can cut back to basic cable.

Basic cable?
That's what they get in prison.

- Hey, what you doing?
- Bad time, Rose.

Money problems?

- How did you know?
- I bought your espresso maker from Berta.

I got a great deal 'cause she didn't
want to carry it on the bus.

Wonderful.

Charlie, "miscellaneous cash expenses"?
What exactly is that?

I don't know. Go see a movie,
buy a hot dog, stuff like that.

It was $80,000 last year.

That. That's women and gambling.

Gone and gone.

Great. Why don't I just shoot myself?

You can't afford a gun.

You know,
I could lend you some money, Charlie.

That's very sweet, Rose,
but I don't really want to shoot myself.

The way I see it, you're either gonna
have to slash expenses,

or find the money to pay your bills
someplace else.

Okay.

- I'll borrow on the house.
- You've already got three mortgages.

- Is that a lot?
- Not if you have three houses.

Let me ask you a tough question.

What would you think about going
to Mom for a short-term loan?

Interesting idea.

I think I'd rather have a pack of hyenas
tear out and devour my intestines.

Yeah, I know. I can't afford hyenas.

Look, you know I'd help you if I could,

but all my money's going
to my former wife, my former house,

my former wife's current lawyers
and all their descendants.

So if you don't want to go to Mom,

you're gonna have to change your
lifestyle for a few months.

Fine. You win.

I win? What do I win?
How is this a win for me?

Whatever. I'll cut back, like you said.

Now come on, let's all go out
for a nice dinner. I'm buying.

Great. Then after we can stop by my
place for espresso.

Good idea. That's a money saver.

"Save 50 cents on one regular-sized
Hamburger Helper

"when you buy two of the following
10.5 ounce... "

Screw it.

- Hi.
- Hi.

How do you like that cabernet?

- It's very good.
- I'll have to try it sometime.

And excuse me for saying so, but you
really don't need the Lean Cuisine.

Thank you.

So, how do you like this

cheese?

That.

I do a little volunteer work making
sandwiches for a homeless shelter.

I don't know if you know this,
but a lot of those homeless fellas

like a little snort once in awhile.

Okay. Seek and ye shall find.

Twenty-four rolls of toilet paper
for $3.99.

I know what you're thinking,
it's single-ply,

but at this price, you can double up,
triple up, go wild!

Okay, have a nice day.

I can't do this anymore, Alan. I quit.

You can't quit poverty, Charlie.

I want the good stuff.

I want cheese that isn't air-dropped
into third-world countries.

I want ouchless toilet paper.

I want vodka that doesn't look like
Fred Flintstone would drink it.

I want my life back.

Fine, then swallow your pride, call Mom,
and ask her to lend you some money.

Yabba-dabba-doo.

Who's the favorite?

- Green Bay.
- Did you bet them?

No.

You took the Redskins?

- No action?
- None.

- Then why are we watching?
- Beats the hell out of me.

Anybody want a snack?

Pizza's here.

You ordered a pizza?

Charlie, you're supposed to be
cutting back on expenses.

Alan, it's a pizza, not a hooker.

Hey, Mr. Harper. Good to see you.

I threw in
some of those garlic puffs you like.

Grabbed a bottle of house red.
I don't think they'll miss it.

Thanks, buddy.
Here's for the pizza and...

Charlie.

Can I speak with you for a minute?

Hang on a sec.

- What are you planning on tipping him?
- I don't know.

Give him $2. That's 15%.

- I can't do that.
- You have to.

I can't. Did you see his face?

Go.

- There you go.
- Thank you, Mr. Harper.

These are ones.

Yeah.

I can break $100.

Yeah, I'm having
kind of a cash flow problem.

Yeah. Well, we had a good run.

Wait.

- Here.
- No, keep it.

You need it more than I do.

So, Deborah said that Julie had
an addiction to cosmetic procedures.

And I said, "Well, then she needs to go
to BOTOX detox. "

Everyone laughed and laughed,

but, of course, you couldn't tell
'cause none of their faces were moving.

That's pretty funny, Mom.

Listen...

Right. You wanted to tell me something.

Yeah. Maybe you should sit down.

What now? You got some girl pregnant?

You're gay? You're on drugs?

$10 says pregnant.

- Jake, go to your room.
- I'm giving odds.

Go.

Okay. Here's the thing.

Would you like a drink?

I suppose. A screwdriver might be nice.

I can't go through with this, Alan.

Sure you can. She'll make
a couple of snide comments

about your frivolous lifestyle, which
luckily, she doesn't know the half of.

You'll just suck it up, pay her back in
a couple of months and that'll be that.

With Mom, "that" is never "that. "
The guilt is always there.

To this day, she still reminds me
how much she had to sacrifice

just so I could get braces.

Like I deliberately had crooked teeth so
she'd be forced to drive a domestic car.

- All right, then just drop it.
- It's dropped.

- Don't ask her.
- I won't.

- Let it go.
- It's gone.

By the way,
they're about to repossess your Jaguar.

Mommy?

Very nice.

So, how much do you need?

I admit that my lifestyle
has been a little frivolous

and I probably should have been
paying closer attention to my expenses.

All right. How much do you need?

This is just a temporary thing,
couple of months.

- How much?
- You'll get it back.

This isn't like the braces
and the Mercury Capri.

Charlie, give me a number.

I really appreciate this, Mom.

No more need be said.

You'll pay it back when you can.

Thanks.

All right. Now that that's taken care of,
why don't I take my boys out to dinner?

There it is!

Everything's got a price.

- Charlie, what are you...
- No.

She can't just do something nice,
there's gotta be strings attached.

Nothing's given out of love.
Everything's got a hook in it!

You can keep your money, lady,
because I'm a free man,

and I can't be bought.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go hide my car.

They're gonna take my Jag away

Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?

I guess.

How come it's so dark in here?

Do you have any idea how much
electricity costs?

No.

I didn't, either,
but it turns out it's quite a racket.

Listen.

I know you're going through a tough time
and I really wanna help you out.

So, please take this.

This is a cashier's check.
Where did you get a cashier's check?

From my dad's bank, silly.

Your dad owns a bank?

Not all by himself.
Me and my brother and sister own 49%.

Really?

What about your mom?

She doesn't have a bank.

- I see.
- She's in oil.

- So you really have...
- Yep, more than God.

Didn't figure that when you dumped me,
did you?

Rose, it wouldn't have mattered.

I know. That's one of the things
I love about you.

You discard women
regardless of their financial status.

Thanks. But I can't take this.

You think I'm crazy, don't you?

My dad and brother said I was crazy,

but I think that was to form a power block
to squeeze me off the Board of Directors.

Shame on them.

I told them that you'd help me
if I needed it.

I mean, you're the first guy I've ever
met who hasn't cared about my money.

Who slept with me because he was drunk,
not because I was rich.

I only wanted to help you
because I thought that we were friends.

Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I am crazy.

No, Rose, it's fine. I am your friend.

And if it means that much to you,
I'll take the money.

Thank you, Charlie.
How can I ever repay you?

Don't worry about it.
And I will pay you back.

I know that.

Better I should owe you
than my manipulating, scheming mother.

That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

Hang on, I'll grab you a tissue.

Thank you.

.......... ********** ..........

There we go. Watch your step.

- I can't feel my face, Charlie.
- You just had two wisdom teeth pulled.

Watch the drool.

Look at that.

- That is a very sexy woman.
- I'm sorry, that arouses you?

- How you doing?
- Hey.

Charlie, walk away.

Relax. This could be interesting.

You got a nice swing.

Thanks.

Try stepping in to it.
You will get more power that way.

You mean like this?

Yeah. Dial one and the area code,
because that is long-distance.

Charlie, let's go,
this woman is clearly a lunatic.

Yeah, but look at the passion, the fire,

the ass.

Is this your car?

- Do I look crazy to you?
- Well, frankly...

- So whose car is it? Cheating boyfriend?
- No.

Psychiatrist.

Charlie, psychiatrist.

- What more do you need to hear?
- Hang on.

- So, you are beating up your shrink's car?
- He said I have anger issues.

The quack.

- Then he hit on me.
- The horny quack.

- Hold this for me.
- Good, I'm on deck.

Man, this is going to take forever.

Either one of you guys got an ice pick?

Don't cars like this
usually have an alarm system?

Thanks a lot.

- Let's get out of here, Charlie.
- Hey!

You are not just going
to leave me here, are you?

Yes.

- Alan.
- Charlie!

So, how come Mush Mouth gets shotgun?

Damn shrink. Anti-depressants,
tranquilizers, sleeping pills.

- You want any of these?
- No, thanks.

No, I'm good.

Are you sure,
because you seem a little edgy?

No, I'm a lot edgy.

Isn't throwing that stuff
on the road a little dangerous?

To who? Raccoons?
They can't get past the childproof cap.

I got to say,
I really appreciate this, guys.

- No problem.
- Big problem.

- Frankie.
- Charlie.

- Awan.
- Awan?

Not "Awan," Awan.

Is Awan a little slow?

Yeah.

But I make up for it by being
a little fast.

- I know your type.
- You do?

Yep.

Don't care for it particularly.

So, where can we drop you?

That's the thing.
I really don't have anywhere to stay.

Why? Did you escape from some place?

Great. Pot shots from Spittle Boy.

And if you must know,
I'm having family problems.

Charlie, you wouldn't happen to know of
a place I could crash tonight, would you?

Crap!

Here we are. Chez Charlie.

Great house!

Oh, wow. You are right on the beach.

I have got to go for a swim.

- She's taking her clothes off.
- Yeah.

Is this a great country or what?

- Hi, Dad. Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, guys.

Rose, what are you doing?

- We are playing Mummy on a Chair.
- I'm the mummy.

Judith, hi.

- Is Jake ready to go?
- Hang on. Jake, your mom's here.

Charlie, why don't you go out on the
deck and keep an eye out for

approaching squalls?

I'm on it.

It's squall season.

- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

- What is he doing?
- He's playing Mummy on a Chair.

Where is the chair?

I don't know the rules, Judith.

Hi, Rose. Thanks for babysitting.

- No problem. We had fun.
- Good.

- So who's the naked lady?
- Not really sure.

She was trashing a car with a baseball
bat when we left the dentist's office

and, you know,
one thing kind of led to another.

So you met cute, that's nice.

But you know, you may want to be
careful with a girl like that, Charlie.

One day it's baseball bats
and windshields,

the next day you wake up with
your testicles Superglued to your thigh.

- Point taken.
- I'm sorry about that, by the way.

Water under the bridge.

Hurry up, Jake. Your mother's waiting.

Remember, I'm bringing him back
tomorrow night so I can see my parents.

Why is there a woman's shoe
on your floor?

Apparently, Mummy on a Chair
is a very complex game.

- Bye, Dad.
- See you, pal.

Tell your brother he is a pig.

I will leave a note on the fridge.

- God, I needed that.
- Me, too.

It's like all my insanity and rage
have just been washed away.

That's good. Because, you know,
all your drugs are on the Coast Highway.

Where can I take a nice hot shower?

I said where, not with whom.

You guys are so cute.

Right back at you.

Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.

While you are at it,
why don't you try humping a bear trap?

Alan, open your eyes.
That is an intriguing and exciting woman.

A rare and magnificent jewel.

- She's hot and you are horny.
- I'm saying.

- I just love warm sake.
- Me, too.

Tora, tora, tora!

You know, Frankie,
there are many fine hotels in the area.

- I can't stay in a hotel.
- Why not?

That is a very good question.

So, where you from?

Guess.

- I wouldn't know where to begin.
- Okay.

Here I am yakking about myself.
What about you guys?

Alan, what do you do?

Good question. Guess.

How about that?

- Alan, don't be childish.
- She started it.

He is a chiropractor.

Really?

That's terrific. I have so much respect
for what you guys do.

- Seriously?
- Yeah.

Thank you. See that, Charlie?

My brother thinks
I'm just a glorified masseuse.

I never said glorified.

Charlie, you are so wrong.

Chiropractors are like
angels of healing.

These hands have amazing powers
to bring relief and even pleasure.

Hey, these aren't exactly hooks.

- Do you get regular chiropractic work?
- Are you kidding? Once a week.

In fact, I'm in desperate need
of an adjustment right now.

- Let me get my table, I will fix you up.
- Awesome.

Do you want me with clothes or without?

Are they looking for me?

You didn't say anything, did you?

I got to go. I love you.
I will see you soon. Come in.

Hi.

I was just going to go to bed and wanted
to see if you needed anything,

towels, sheets,

vodka?

No, I'm great, thanks. Alan got me
totally jelled out with that adjustment.

Man, you are so lucky
to have him right here in this house.

Yeah, I'm living a dream.

So, listen, if you need to talk to somebody
about, you know, anything, I'm here.

I see that.

Okay, then.

Yeah.

I think you are a really cool guy.

Yeah.

But I'm not going to have sex with you.

- Ever?
- Good night, Charlie.

Good night.

Okay. Round one to the hot, crazy chick.

Man, deep tissue massage, pancakes.

If you had a TV on your forehead and could
breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.

So nobody makes you pancakes
where you live?

Not your husband,

boyfriend,

girlfriend,

mother, father, grandma, cellmate?

Round two.

- Morning, Frankie.
- Morning, Charlie.

- Morning.
- Yeah.

So, Frankie. Boy, that is a pretty name.

- How did you sleep?
- Great. Except,

I had this wild erotic dream.

And I woke up all drenched in sweat.

- Could you pass the syrup?
- Sure. Yeah.

Thanks, sweetie. You are a doll.

You know, I can't thank you guys enough
for letting me stay here last night.

I just wish there was some way
I could repay you.

For a start, you could tell us
something about yourself.

Anything, really.

I wouldn't mind
hearing more about that dream.

All right. I guess I can trust you guys.

Charlie, Alan.

I know this may sound totally crazy

but I work for a secret
government agency,

and my current mission is...

I'm sorry. You should see your faces.
You guys are so easy.

All right, I'm going to go take a bath.

Who wants to scrub my back? Too late!

Sometimes I just crack me up.

So, what have you got going for today?

Nothing. I was just going
to hang around the house.

Yeah. Me, too.

- No work? No errands?
- Not a thing.

- Maybe you could see a movie.
- I've seen a movie.

Come on, Alan.

- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

Why don't you admit
that you are interested in Frankie?

I'm not.

- You are not?
- Honest to God.

Fine.

But hypothetically,
if I were interested in her,

would you care?

Of course I would.

You are my brother. I don't want
to see you get your feelings hurt.

You just assume that if we are both
interested in the same woman

you would come out on top?

- Aren't you going to say anything?
- What? There was no question there.

- God, you are such an arrogant jerk.
- See, your feelings are hurt.

My feelings are fine.

I think the real issue here is Frankie
likes me better and it's driving you crazy.

No.

What's driving me crazy is that you
fought tooth and nail to keep the lunatic

out of this house,
but now that she is here, you want her.

I never said I wanted her.

But you think that if you did want her,

you could have her
even if I wanted her, too.

- Aren't you going to say something?
- There was no question there.

Okay. Fine.

Take your best shot.
Let me just give you a little heads up.

- I am way out in front.
- Yeah? How do you figure?

Frankie and I have already discussed
having sex.

What are you doing?

I just thought Frankie
might like some fresh towels.

I already gave her fresh towels.

Really?

Well, aren't you Toweley Towellerson
all of a sudden.

- You know, Alan, it's not my fault.
- What's not your fault?

That I've always been more successful
with women than you.

Have been, Charlie. Have been.
We are not teenagers anymore.

Your bad-boy act just might be
wearing just a little thin.

- Or you just might be a little jealous.
- Jealous?

Don't... me.

When the occasion calls for...
I have every right to...

What? I thought we were
doing funny noises.

That was an elephant.

- Yeah, elephant.
- It was good. Yeah. Really good.

I'm ready to go.
Can one of you guys give me a ride?

- Absolutely.
- Sure.

- Great. Who's driving?
- I will.

- I got the Jag.
- I got the Volvo.

- Mine's faster.
- Mine's safer.

- Alan, stop competing with me.
- Why don't you stop competing with me?

- Why should I stop? I'm winning.
- Like hell you are.

- Like hell I am. Ask Frankie.
- Why don't you ask Frankie?

- I don't need to ask her.
- What are you afraid of?

I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard
I'll be an only child.

Yeah? Bring it on.

Hey! Stop it!

What is wrong with you two?
You are family. You are brothers.

Do you understand how precious that is?

Do you have a clue the pain you feel
when a family rips itself apart

and there is no one to replace them?

I mean, that's it, you know,
you are all alone in the world and...

It's just so horrible.

- It's okay.
- Yeah, look, we are not fighting.

Yeah. We love each other. See?

Yeah, and it doesn't matter who drives,
you know. We will both come.

Good. Let's go.

- Nice house.
- Yeah.

All right, I've just got to pick up
a few things and then,

I was hoping you could take me
to the train station.

- The train station? Where are you going?
- I don't know. I will figure something out.

If it helps any, you are welcome to stay
with us for a couple more days.

- I couldn't impose.
- It's no imposition.

- Yeah. We like having you.
- Are you sure?

It's settled. You are staying with us.

Man, how much do I love you guys.

I'll be right back.

- What a nice girl.
- Yeah.

Of course, we still don't know
a damn thing about her.

True. Although that is one big-ass house
she lives in.

Or is robbing.

That would make us
the duped getaway drivers.

Moron accessories to grand theft.

That's a major felony.

Yeah. Hard time.

I can't do hard time, Charlie.
I have allergies.

That's going to be your biggest problem.

Watch your head, sweetheart.

Hi.

I'm Joanie.

- Hi.
- Okay. We can go now.

Where are we going, Mommy?

We are going to go
to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.

It's a wonderful place where
those awful people will never find us.

You were right.

We should have taken the Volvo.

Stay tuned for scenes
from the next Two and a Half Men.

Next on Two and a Half Men.

Are you guys gay?

- Unfit, how?
- You know...

We got to get them out of here.

You can take your damn money

and stick it up
your "white bread, country club,

"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.

I just met your brother's latest stuff.

- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What? Is it yours?

No, but it's not his, either.

Hold on there, Pecos Bill.

No, I like girls.
Just not into eight-year-olds.

The bad news is
that wasn't my shrink's car.

It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

Come on. Don't you want to spoon?

Coffee?

I'm the extra guy.

I'm wrapped
tighter than an airport sandwich.

Here, I'm running late.

You're going to get laid tonight.

Why doesn't she just kick me
in the balls?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men.

That is a very sexy woman.

- So whose car is it?
- Psychiatrist.

Let's get out of here, Charlie.

You are not just going
to leave me here, are you?

Here we are. Chez Charlie.

- She's taking her clothes off.
- Is this a great country or what?

You guys are so cute.

Right back at you.

Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.

Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy.

But I'm not going to have sex with you.

Ever?

Deep tissue massage, pancakes.

If you had a TV on your forehead and could
breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.

You just assume that if we are both
interested in the same woman

- you would come out on top?
- Of course I would.

What are you afraid of?

I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard
I'll be an only child.

- Are you sure?
- It's settled. You are staying with us.

Of course, we still don't know
a damn thing about her.

I'm Joanie.

Hi.

We are going to go
to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.

It's a wonderful place where
those awful people will never find us.

So, Frankie,

why didn't you tell us you
had a daughter?

Okay, guys, here's the deal.

I didn't want you to know.

Okay. I feel better.

I'm sorry, it's a long story.

We got time. I'm not doing anything.
Alan, you doing anything?

No, I'm free.

I was staying with my grandma
and grandpa, who are really rich,

and they don't want my mom to have me,
so they said she's crazy.

That wasn't so long.

- Can we please talk about this later?
- Okay. What shall we talk about?

Are you guys gay?

Isn't she something?

Okay, here we are.

This is it, right? One kid, no pets?

As far as I know.

- Can I go look at the ocean?
- Sure, just stay on the deck.

Okay, who has the first question?

- Alan.
- Thank you.

- What the hell is going on?
- Good one.

Here it is. I married a really rich guy,
and his parents always hated me.

I don't know.
Maybe it was because when we met,

he was on the road
to becoming a U.S. Congressman

and I was just, you know, on the road.

Joanie, get off the railing.

Anyway, they were not happy
when we got married,

and they were even less happy
when we used part of his trust fund

to finance my recording career.

- You're a singer?
- Well, as it turns out, no. But...

Then two years ago, Brad died.

And ever since, his parents have been
trying to take Joanie away from me.

- So, the psychiatrist...
- Court ordered.

They're suing me for custody,
saying I'm an unfit parent.

- Unfit, how?
- You know...

I'm not a lawyer,

but taking a baseball bat
to the shrink's Beamer

might not have helped your case.

Yeah, they'll probably spin that one
in their favor.

But I was screwed anyway

because they were paying him
to make me look bad.

- That's horrible.
- So what are your plans now?

I don't know. I didn't think past
just getting her out of there.

You don't have to know.

You can stay here for a while
and figure it out. Right?

- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

That'd be great. I'll go tell Joanie.

Terrific. We're happy to have you.

Okay, we've got to get her out of here.

- Charlie, she needs us.
- She doesn't need us.

She needs a lawyer
and probably a new shrink.

Well, then we'll get her those.

At this point, I think I'd like
to stop using the word "we. "

You're going to bail on her?

Two days ago,
you couldn't wait to get her in bed.

That's because two days ago,
she was just a crazy stranger.

If I remember correctly,
you couldn't wait to get rid of her.

Yes, because she was a crazy stranger.

Now I've gotten to know her
and I want her to stay.

All right, Alan, but I'm warning you.
This girl's got a lot of baggage.

I don't know if you have enough
sky cabs to get her to the curb.

What?

So, Joanie, what grade are you in?

- Second.
- Really?

- I have a little boy who's in fourth.
- So?

I don't know. I thought it'd be germane
to the conversation.

Wow. Doesn't matter how old they are,
you still strike out.

You know, Joanie,
you are just as pretty as your mom.

So?

I bow to the master.

Hold on, let me finish.

All right,
I'm going to say this one more time

real slow so there's no confusion.

You can take your damn money

and stick it up
your "white bread, country club,

"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.

Hi.

- Really? I'm garbage.
- Is Alan here?

Really? Is that right?

Well, I got news for you, lady.
The term is white trash.

- Do you know her?
- Nope, that's a new one.

- Hi, Dad.
- Jake, Judith. What are you doing here?

Alan, I told you yesterday
I was going to visit my parents.

Dad's having another colonoscopy.

If I'm not there,
I'll have to watch the video.

Yeah, right. I'm sorry.
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

Yeah.
I just met your brother's latest stuff.

- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What? Is it yours?

No, but it's not his, either.

- But it could be.
- Says who?

Says your ex-wife.

Okay, I really don't need to hear this.
Jake, honey, have a good time.

Charlie, behave yourself.

What about me?

I am completely capable
of having my own stuff.

- Hi, I'm Joanie.
- Hey. I'm going to go play in my room.

- Can I come with you?
- Whatever.

If he can just keep that attitude
for another 30 years, he's gold.

I'm not afraid of your lawyers
or your shrinks.

Fine, bring them on,
because you know what?

We're going to run away and hide.

Now they're really unhappy with me.

- Is there anything we can do?
- Thanks, you've already done so much.

- I just hate to put you out like this.
- It is not a problem.

We have plenty of space.
You and Joanie can stay in my room

and I'll bunk with Charlie.

You'll bunk with Charlie?

- Hold on there, Pecos Bill.
- No, it'll be fun.

It'll be like when we were kids.

Okay.

But just remember, this time
Mom won't be around to hear you scream.

Why are those people here?

They're going through a tough time,
and we're helping them out.

That girl is really annoying.

- I think maybe she has a crush on you.
- Yeah, that's what's annoying.

- You don't really like girls yet?
- No, I like girls.

Just not into eight-year-olds.

Is Joanie okay?

Yeah. She fell asleep
as soon as her head hit the pillow.

- It was a long day for her.
- Yeah.

The good news is
I think my in-laws are going to back off.

The bad news is
that wasn't my shrink's car.

Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.

But at least you made this one
for the right reason.

You love your daughter.

I just wish I knew where to
go from here.

Because I know
I seem like I've got it all together,

- but this is a little...
- Scary?

Yeah. I understand.

When my marriage ended, I was terrified.

It's the unknown.

- Yeah.
- No, don't cry.

Everything will work out, you'll see.

- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

Come here.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

How much did you see?

Just enough to make sleep impossible.

Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.

All we did was kiss,
but, Charlie, what a kiss.

It was like our souls were merging.

- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.

I mean, Frankie is incredible.
Think about it.

First she loses her husband, then
she has to fight to keep her daughter,

and yet, still she has such incredible
spirit, such joie de vivre.

Okay,
would you like to hear my take on this?

Is it positive and life affirming?

Good night, Alan.

Okay, no. Tell me what you think.

All right.

I've known you all your life,
and if there's one thing I've noticed,

you are a stone sucker
for the damsel in distress.

- I am not.
- Come on, Alan.

Every woman
you've ever been involved with

has been damaged and needy.

Wait, what about... Okay, go on.

You devote all your time and energy
into fixing them up

instead of doing the humane thing,

which is to have sex with them
and run away.

Exactly how is that the humane thing?

My way, they have a good time,
you have a good time, nobody suffers.

Your way, you get married,
you take over their lives,

they start to hate you,
and you end up moving in with me.

You know what, Charlie?
I think you're jealous.

- Of who?
- Of me.

For the first time in our lives,
a woman picked me

over you, and you can't deal with it.

I can deal with it.
I don't get it, but I can deal with it.

I feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry that your heart

has become so hard and small
that you've lost the capacity

to connect with another human being
on any level any more meaningful

than the inebriated exchange
of bodily fluids.

Boy, leave it to you
to take a beautiful thing

like drunken sex and make it
sound dirty.

I don't know why
I even bother talking to you.

- Alan?
- What?

I thought we had a pact
to never go to bed mad.

Leave me alone.

Come on. Don't you want to spoon?

I swear to God,
you are going to lose that hand.

- That's not my hand.
- Mom!

- Do you know where Jake is?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.

- We're playing hide-and-seek.
- I don't know where he's hiding.

No, I was hiding,
and he was supposed to find me.

It's been over an hour.

- If I see him, I'll let him know.
- Thank you.

You're welcome.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Morning.

- Coffee?
- Thank you.

So, I thought maybe today, you, me,
and the kids might go do something fun.

- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.

I know. Why don't we go

to Will Rogers State Park
and have a picnic?

- That sounds nice.
- Great.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Oh, man.

I'm the extra guy.

Don't call yourself extra.

- Try superfluous.
- Alan.

- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!

Interesting.

- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.

Don't really like it.

- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.

Do not call me a great guy.

That's what you call
the schmuck loser friend

who has to dance with the

hot chick's ugly cousin.

- What?
- Nothing. Just having a really good day.

- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No. Couldn't find a date.

Jake,

Mom wants to know
if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.

- Tuna.
- Me, too.

God, she's annoying.

At least you're not a third nipple.

Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen

and help Joanie pick out some snacks
for the picnic basket?

You sure you don't want to come with us?

- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.

Listen, Frankie,
we need to talk about you and Alan.

Come on, stud.

- You're not jealous, are you?
- No. Dumbfounded, maybe.

Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted,
but not jealous.

I just want to make sure that you
understand how vulnerable he is.

You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?

Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie,

but I'm wrapped tighter
than an airport sandwich.

Okay, let me put it this way,
my brother is crazy about you.

Well, I'm crazy about him, too.

No, you don't understand.
Alan's a nester.

He's already imagining
the two of you walking through IKEA,

picking out flatware and throw pillows.

- Come on.
- He did it with me.

You really care about him, don't you?

Yes.

You're a great guy, Charlie.

Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.

Why doesn't she just kick me
in the balls?

- Want to play tag?
- No.

- Hide-and-seek?
- No.

- Want to chase me?
- No.

- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan. Thank you.

Hey, what makes it wonderful
is the company.

Do you always say exactly the right
thing?

I don't know.

I suppose I try to be sensitive
to the moment

and weigh my words
so that they're emotional...

No, not always.

Listen, Frankie, I was thinking.

We get along so well,
and our kids get along,

and since neither one of us
really has our own place...

Alan.

Absolutely not.

- But...
- No. My life is such a mess,

and I've got to straighten out
a bunch of things

before I can even think
about a relationship.

Yes, you've got a lot of baggage,
but it's nothing I can't get to the curb.

- What?
- It was something Charlie said.

I was hoping you'd know what it meant.

No. Alan,

I talked to my brother in Seattle today,

and he and his wife are going
to put me and Joanie up for a while.

- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.

'Cause, you know, I can enroll her
in school there and get a job

and start putting my life
back together again.

Yeah, no. That makes sense. Sure.

- I'm sorry.
- No. You're doing the right thing.

- Look on the bright side, Alan.
- What bright side?

You're going to get laid tonight.

Oh, boy. I think I'm going to cry again.

Okay, hon, the cab's waiting.
Say goodbye to Jake.

- Bye, Jake.
- Bye.

Oh, man!

- Charlie, what can I say?
- I know. I'm a great guy.

Oh, man!

You know, I would've been happy
to drive you to the airport.

No, it's better to say goodbye here,
because LAX is hectic and crazy,

and the underwire in my bra
always sets off the metal detectors.

You know,
this doesn't have to be goodbye forever.

Once we get all settled,
you can come visit us.

Sure.

Bye.

Here, I'm running late.

- It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?
- Yeah. I'm really going to miss Joanie.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey! There he is! High five!
- Down low. Too slow.

Come here, clown. Upside down.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Judith, how's it going?

Hey, Uncle Charlie, show Mom
how I mop the floor with my hair.

Well, it's not really mopping.
It's more like dusting.

- What if you drop him on his head?
- Then I guess I will have to mop.

- Wonderful. Where's Alan?
- He's in the kitchen.

Walk this way.

Master,

your sexually ambivalent
ex-wife is here.

- I'm not ambivalent, I'm exploring.
- Yes, mistress.

- Thanks for bringing Jake over.
- Well, I wanted to give you this anyway.

- What is it?
- It's the bill from my divorce lawyer.

- You haven't been paying them.
- Told you they'd notice.

I also need you
to look this over and sign it.

And what is this?

My lawyer recommended I take out
a bigger life-insurance policy on you

in case you should die and can't pay
the alimony and legal fees.

Why don't you have him frozen?

Then you can use him
to keep your drinks cold, too.

And who's supposed to pay for this
policy?

You are. And please,
try to be on time with the premiums.

Boy, my shallow, empty lifestyle
is looking pretty good right about now.

Okay, as long as we're on the subject
of lawyers and death,

my lawyer recommended that I redraft
my will. And you know what?

If I die after you die,
guess who gets custody of Jake?

- Charlie.
- Charlie?

- Me?
- What about my sister?

- I never liked your sister.
- Is this the sister I slept with?

Shut up, Charlie.

Alan, you can't be serious.
He's immature, he drinks too much,

he sleeps around,
he is completely irresponsible.

Yeah, you should've thought of that
before you threw me out.

Yeah.

All right. You're obviously angry
and trying to get even with me,

but I am not gonna take the bait.
I will see you on Sunday.

Bye-bye.

- Hey, man. Thanks.
- For what?

For trusting me to take care of Jake
when you croak.

I'm sorry.
You didn't think I was serious, did you?

I just said that to piss her off.

Right. Good one. Hey!

That's not fair!

Why don't I get to keep the kid
when you're dead?

If I'm dead. And Judith would have to die
before me for it to even be an issue.

It's a contingency plan
for a hypothetical worst-case scenario.

I know it's a long shot, but I had
the Marlins in the World Series.

Don't tell me they don't come in.

It never occurred to me that you'd
want to be a full-time parent.

This isn't about what I want.
This is about what you want,

- and you don't want me to have Jake.
- What?

Nothing.

Why'd you say my name?

Get over yourself,
no one said your name.

So what's wrong with me?

Charlie, you're a great uncle.
You're there for all the fun stuff.

I don't think you're up to the hard work
of being a full-time parent to Jake.

- What?
- Nothing.

Nothing.

So if not me,
then who are you giving him to?

I'm not giving him to anybody.
He's not a 5-pound ham.

You know what I mean.
Who gets him in that scenario thing?

- Cousin Jerry and his wife Faye.
- Jerry and Faye? Why Jerry and Faye?

They've got a good marriage, three kids,
lots of dogs, a big backyard,

and they live in a great
school district.

Yeah, but I'm your brother!

- Charlie, it's not...
- And I live right here.

You wouldn't have to ship him off
to Corn Hole, Kansas.

Coventry, Rhode Island.

Who am I thinking of that lives
in Kansas?

I don't know, Dorothy and Toto?

All right, Alan,
let me ask you something.

If I'm here, and Jake's in Rhode Island,

who's gonna teach him
all the things he needs to know?

Jerry and Faye
are both college professors.

I'm talking about the important stuff.
About life.

Face it. When the time comes,

are those two eggheads gonna step up
and get your kid laid?

- You're not helping your case, Charlie.
- Fine, you've made your decision.

Despite all I've been through
with your son,

my nephew,
obviously I have no say in the matter.

Where are you going?

Alan, quite frankly, I'm a little
hurt and a little disappointed,

so I'm gonna go make myself
a big glass of vodka

and sit and think about things.

Charlie, wait. Okay, how about this?

If Judith dies and then I die,
and then Jerry and Faye die,

Jake will come and live with you.

Yeah, like I'm gonna outlive
Jerry and Faye the way I drink.

- What do you say to Grandma?
- Can I at least open it first?

- Jake.
- No, he's right.

Wait and see if he likes it.

- Now you can thank me.
- Thank you.

I'm kidding.

No little boy wants a framed picture
of his grandmommy.

This is for your daddy.

- What do you say, Dad?
- Don't push me, Jake.

That's my new photo
for the Sunday real estate section.

I thought maybe you'd like
a color print of it for your office.

Gee, Mom, we've already got the one
of you swimming with dolphins.

So you didn't bring me anything?

Is that all grandmommy is good for,
to bring you gifts?

Of course I brought you something.
There.

Crayons? I'm 10.

Well, it's not just crayons, sweetheart.

It's also a dinosaur coloring book.

- But I'm 10.
- You want to trade?

No, I'm good.

- So, where's your brother?
- Why? What'd he get?

Nothing. I just want to make sure
he knows why.

He's in his room.
He's been sulking all weekend.

- Sulking? About what?
- Well, it's the silliest thing.

I just happened to mention

that in the unlikely event that
Judith should die, and I should die,

that custody of Jake would go to...

- Custody of Jake would go to who?
- Actually, it would be "whom. "

- Alan, who gets Jake?
- Now, see, that's grammatically correct.

- Alan.
- Jerry and Faye.

Jerry and Faye who?

- Your sister's son and his wife.
- Them?

You would bypass your own mother

in favor of two potato farmers
on Long Island?

They're agriculture professors
in Rhode Island.

Really?

Who am I thinking of
who lives on Long Island?

I have no idea.

- Well, regardless, I am deeply insulted.
- Come on, Mom.

This is only if Judith and I both die,
and we're not dying.

- At least, not before you.
- Now you're wishing me dead.

- No, Mom. No, it's...
- Give me back my picture.

No. Better you should look at it
and feel shame.

- Hey, want to play one-on-one?
- Sure.

Check it out.

One, nothing.

You know that Rhode Island
isn't really an island?

That's just a flat-out lie.

Two, nothing.

Hey, I've got to run some errands,
so I'll be back in about an hour.

You guys gonna be okay?

Gee, Alan,
you sure I can handle the responsibility?

What if he wants to go to college
or something?

Charlie, please don't start.
I'll see you later.

- Hey!
- Three, nothing.

- That was a time-out.
- You didn't call it.

- Fine. Three, nothing.
- You want a do-over?

No, I don't want a do-over.
Just bring it on.

Not so easy when I'm paying attention,
is it?

Not so hard, either.

- My head!
- Oh, God.

- You okay?
- No.

- All right, don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

Good. You're gonna be fine.

- We've just got to stop the bleeding.
- I'm bleeding?

- What?
- Nothing. Just a little trickle.

Here, take my shirt. Hold it up here.

I'm sorry.
Okay, let's get you up, nice and slow.

Attaboy. I'll grab my car keys
and we'll head to the hospital.

A hospital?
I don't want to go to a hospital!

Did I say "hospital"?
I meant Disneyland.

How's it going there, pal?
You still bleeding?

- I don't know.
- No, don't look.

You just hang in there,
we'll get you fixed up,

and you'll be back home
before you know it.

Just as soon as we find
the freaking hospital.

- You don't know where the hospital is?
- Of course I know where it is.

I'm kind of hungry.
Can we stop for a chili cheeseburger?

You're hungry?
How could you even think about food?

What do you think about
when you're hungry?

Fair enough.

We'll get you a chili cheeseburger
at the hospital.

- Will they have fries at the hospital?
- They have everything.

Some people go just for the food.

Man, we'd better call your dad.

Hello?

- Why do you have your father's phone?
- I don't know.

- That's great.
- Bye.

Yes! An ambulance.
Fifty-fifty shot he's going to a hospital.

Hang on!

I can't believe we beat the ambulance.

Yeah, well, those things are just
ice-cream trucks with blood bags.

Hi, we need to see a doctor.

- Just fill this out and have a seat.
- No, you don't understand.

He hit his head, he's bleeding.

- Did he lose consciousness?
- No.

I got a little woozy, though.

Follow my finger.

He's gonna be fine.

That's it? He's gonna be fine?

That's not a medical test,
that's how you hypnotize a chicken.

I'd like a chili cheeseburger and fries,
please.

You see, he's hallucinating. Can you
please just get him in to a doctor?

Well, you need to fill this out first.

Come on, this is gonna take forever.
Can't we do this later?

Over dinner?

Now you're hallucinating.

Come on, buddy.

All right. Let's see. Last name, Harper.

First name, Jake. Ob?

Jacob. I knew that. Middle name?

- You don't know?
- Of course I know.

I want to see if you know.
You fell on your head, dude.

David.

Jacob David. They went full Old Testament
on you, didn't they?

- Age, 10. Allergies?
- I don't know.

Is there anything you eat
that makes you sick?

I ate a worm once.

No allergies.
Have you had any of the following?

- Measles?
- I don't know.

- Mumps?
- I don't know.

- Chicken pox?
- Is that the one with the spots?

- Yeah.
- I don't know.

All right. We're just gonna vote
the straight "no" ticket.

Family history?

Your grandmother's always been
a pain in the ass.

Gonzales?

- Right here!
- I'm Gonzales.

No, you're not.

Right. He's Gonzales.

- Okay, you're gonna feel a little sting.
- Nobody said I had to get a shot!

It's just to numb your skin
so you won't feel the stitches.

What are you gonna give me
to not feel the shot?

It's all right, pal.
I'm right here with you.

Big deal.
I'm still gonna get a shot in my head.

Come on, just hold my hand,
look me in the eyes.

Go ahead, Doc.

- Hey, go easy on the kid!
- No, you're squishing my hand!

Sorry.
But you didn't feel the shot, did you?

- No.
- You're welcome.

Maybe you'd prefer to wait outside.

I'd prefer a morphine drip
and a sponge bath,

but the kid needs me.

- How many stitches am I gonna get?
- I don't know, three or four.

That's all? Scott Pressman got nine

when his sister hit him
with the Etch-A-Sketch.

Help us out here, Doc.

Okay, I'll go five,
but one is purely decorative.

Thank you.

- Is this gonna leave a scar?
- I'm afraid so.

- No.
- Yes!

Okay, let's get started.

Good, maybe that's your father.

Hello. Hey, Judith.

No, it's me, Charlie.

What am I doing with Alan's phone?
Why? Do you want custody of that, too?

Come on, that's funny.

I don't know. Maybe Alan and I
accidentally switched phones.

Why don't you try calling him on mine?
310-LICKME.

I didn't pick it,
but that's what it spells.

Okay. Goodbye.

Are you doing it?
'Cause I can't feel anything.

- Yeah, that's the idea.
- Can you see my brain?

Sure, it's a big brain.
You must be very smart.

- Phone's ringing.
- No, it's not.

The doctor's just stimulating
the phone-ring part of your brain.

- Right, Doc?
- Sure, why not?

I ordered a chili cheeseburger out there.
Will they know to bring it in?

Come on, Mom. Those are
two completely different scenarios.

Hey.

Cool hats.

So, you're saying that because
I didn't name you as Jake's guardian,

you're switching your medical
power of attorney from me to Charlie?

- What's going on?
- Hang on.

If Mom's ever in a coma, you're the one
who has to decide to pull the plug.

Pull.

All right, Mom, Charlie's onboard.
Yeah, got to go.

Hey, where have you guys been?

You know,
we went and got a couple of hamburgers,

bought some hats.

Ate the hamburgers, wearing the hats.

Okay.

- You're right, he bought it.
- Bought what?

Dude,
you can forget about a life of crime.

Oh, my God. What happened?

We were playing basketball,
and it got a little rough.

- He fouled me.
- You charged.

- Did not.
- Did, too!

Hold on.

- So you took him to the emergency room?
- Yes.

Where the cheeseburgers sucked,
by the way.

But he's okay?
There's no concussion or anything?

- No.
- We saw my brain.

No, we didn't. We didn't see any brains.

Hey, why didn't you call me?

There it is.
Why do you have my cell phone?

I don't know.

All right. You sure you're okay?

- Can I go watch TV?
- Sure.

I am really sorry, Alan.

- Don't worry about it. He's fine.
- Yeah, but I'm not.

You were right.

I obviously can't be trusted
to take care of Jake.

Believe me,
the second you're in the ground,

I'm sticking that kid on a plane
to Rhode Island.

Charlie, let me tell you something.

You can't keep Jake
from ever getting hurt.

I mean, he's a boy. That's...
Getting hurt is like his job.

Last summer, he actually fractured his
ass doing a cannonball into the bathtub.

All I care about
is that he has somebody who loves him

and who'll step up when it really counts.
And that's what you did today.

Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

Yeah. And if, God forbid,

something should ever happen
to Judith and me,

I would be very comfortable knowing
that you were looking after my son.

Dead, but comfortable.

Does this mean
you're putting me in the will?

- Yeah.
- Wow. Thanks, man.

That means a lot.

- Just do me a favor, all right?
- What's that?

Don't die.

- That's a very cute hat.
- Thank you.

It makes my hair sweat.

Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

I got five stitches.
There was blood everywhere.

- Why didn't anyone tell me?
- I just did.

- Can we stop for pizza?
- I can't believe this.

I'm going to have a little talk
with your father.

Hello?

.......... ********** ..........

- But I don't want to go to summer camp.
- Are you kidding?

You'll have a great time.
Look at this one.

It's a computer camp
with a theater program.

Ethernet by day, No, no,
Nanette by night.

I don't want to go to camp.

If the kid doesn't want to go,
don't make him go.

- Yeah.
- He's 10, he's old enough to work.

What?

When I was your age, I spent my summers
hosing tarantulas off bananas

in the back of my stepfather's truck.

- What's going on?
- I'm going to camp.

Okay. Morning, all. Beautiful day.

- You're in a good mood.
- Well, I suppose I am.

I got a little e-mail this morning
from an ex-girlfriend,

who says she needs to "see" me.

No kidding.
I wonder if she's "knocked up. "

Nobody's knocked up.
I haven't heard from her in five years.

So she's bringing you a 4-year-old.

Believe me, nobody's bringing anything.

- Remember Jill?
- Jill the slob?

Yeah, but do you remember
how hot she was?

Sure, she was a tight unit,
but she left dirty dishes everywhere.

Swear to God, this broad left
half eaten casseroles in the bathtub.

So?

With a body like that she could drink
out of the toilet if she wanted to.

Wait a minute.
Isn't she the one who dumped you?

Somebody dumped Charlie?

Broke his little black heart.
It was pathetic.

She didn't dump me.

She had personal problems and moved
to Europe to, you know, find herself.

- Berta?
- He wept.

I did not. I felt the appropriate
amount of sadness

for a good relationship
that had run its course.

I had to carry him to bed
three nights in a row.

I was perfectly happy
sleeping under the deck.

You bring her home, you clean up after.

Thank God you never get any.

- What can I get for you?
- White wine, please.

Maybe a Chablis.

You know, make it a beer. Light beer.

Just a beer.

Another one?

Might as well.
Looks like I'm getting stood up.

Chicks, huh?

Maybe she's got a good reason.

I tell you what,
if it were any other woman,

I'd have been out of here an hour ago.

- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

This girl?
This girl's something different.

How so?

Well, did you ever go out
with somebody who's not only

great in bed
but also like a really cool friend?

Yeah. Once.

In fact, now that I think about it,

the friendship was the best part
of our relationship.

No kidding?

Yeah. The sex was a little weird.

We would like wrestle to get on top.

She would actually get angry
if she wasn't up there.

Maybe she had a good reason.

Maybe.

Charlie, look at me.

- How do you know my name?
- It's me.

Me who?

No.

Yes.

Jill?

Bill.

No.

We're gonna need two shots of tequila.

- That's okay, I don't want to...
- They're not for you.

This girl you're waiting for
really must be something.

Just serve the hooch
and mind your own business.

- Listen, Charlie, I know...
- Hang on.

Okay, go.

I know this comes as a shock to you.

Please, if I had a nickel for every time

a girl dumped me
and disappeared for five years

and came back as a guy,
I'd have a nickel.

Keep them coming.

I think I owe you an explanation.

Who pays the nickel, by the way?

Is it you or just out of some
general fund?

Yeah?

Remember, when we broke up and I said,
"It's not you, it's me"?

Yes. And I believe you now.

I was so mixed up and unhappy
as a woman.

So? I know lots of mixed up,
unhappy women.

They go shopping and eat ice cream.
Did you even try that?

I tried everything, but the truth is,

I was always a man trapped
in a woman's body.

No, I'm not buying this.

If you were really a man back then,
you would've jumped at that

three-way with the cocktail waitress
in Carmel.

I begged you.

- You haven't changed.
- I wish I could say the same.

Charlie, how could I have explained it
to you back then?

I couldn't even explain it to myself.

Okay, now you've explained. Thank you.

Nice to see you again.

Good luck with the penis.

Wait.

A few minutes ago you said
I was a really cool friend.

Yeah.

Well, I'm back in LA and I'm kind of
starting a new life.

- And I could really use a friend.
- Oh, boy.

It's just...

You know, I'm completely alone,

and I'm really scared.

Jeez.

- It's gonna be okay, Jill.
- Bill.

Yeah, Bill, whatever. It's okay.

I'm still your friend.

Charlie, you're the best.

I wish I could've loved you the way
you deserve to be loved.

Thanks for the ride, Bill.
You're a good friend.

- You called me Bill.
- That's your name, lady.

Just like old times, huh?

Drag your drunk ass home,
take you upstairs,

get you undressed and...

Alan.

You never met my brother, Alan, did you?

No, I never met anyone
in your family, Charlie.

Yeah, different rules now.

Bill, this is my brother Alan.
Alan, this is my old friend, Bill.

- Nice to meet you, Bill.
- Same here.

I thought you were gonna hook up with
that girlfriend who wanted to "see" you.

Right.

Turns out she changed her "mind. "

Anyway,
I ran into my old friend, Bill, here.

So, stood up by Jill, ran into Bill.

That's funny.

You have a sick sense of humor, Alan.

The house is clean, I'm going home now.

I'll pick that up on Monday.

I'm sorry, that's mine.

Hi.

Okay, I'm out of here.

So, Bill, you from around here?

I was, but I moved away
for a couple years.

I'm planning on moving back
and buying a place.

Hello.

Evelyn Harper,
Evelyn Harper Real Estate.

- Yeah, Mom's here.
- No problem, I'm drunk.

I'm Bill Shraeder.
I'm a friend of Charlie's.

No need to apologize.

So, are you interested in renting
or buying?

- Buying.
- Excellent.

Price range?

- I'm flexible.
- I'll bet you are.

- But I was talking money.
- So was I.

Sexy and liquid. I like that in a man.

- Nice guy. Poker buddy?
- Used to.

And don't call me "buddy. "

There it is.

Thank you so much for showing me
the condos, Evelyn.

Thank you for dinner, Bill.

Thank you for dessert.

Shall we go to my place
for coffee and cigars?

- I don't smoke.
- You will when I'm done with you.

Oh, my God.

He's like half her age.

Yeah. That's the problem.

I'm trying, Charlie.
I'm trying to be open-minded.

But our mom with a guy who's younger
than us, it's just freaking me out.

Trust me, Alan.

Very soon you're gonna be looking back
on this moment with fond nostalgia.

- What do you mean?
- Look.

- Who's this?
- This is Jill.

The woman who dumped you?

Get over that. Nobody dumped me.

All right, I'm sorry.
Why are we looking at Jill?

- Just look at it.
- Okay.

She's cute.

Very tall.

Broad shoulders. Holy mother of God!

Welcome to the Matrix.

- So Jill is...
- Yep.

- And you and Jill used to...
- Every chance we got.

- And Mom is...
- At this very moment.

Holy mother of God!

What are you guys yelling about?

- Go to bed.
- Go to bed.

- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes.

I slept with a woman
who wanted to be a man.

Or,
I slept with a man in a woman's body.

Or, and this is my new favorite,
and the title of my autobiography,

my mom and I slept with the same dude.

Excuse me, could we just
table that for now and discuss

how this impacts on our mother?

Why? The damage has been done.

All that's left to do now is drink

until the part of the brain
that creates mental pictures is dead.

Charlie, stay with me.

Do you think I'm gay?

For God's sake, Charlie,
this is not about you.

I like musical theater.

Maybe all these years
I've been pathologically chasing women

because I've been overcompensating.

You know, I've often thought that.

What? I'm agreeing with you.
What do you want to hear?

I want you to tell me
that there is no chance

that either of us will ever have to call
a woman I slept with "Daddy. "

Jill the slob.

Gadzooks!

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Morning.
- Morning.

So, how was your weekend?

- Fine.
- Okay.

Nothing exciting happening
in your world, Charlie?

- Like what?
- I don't know.

Go to a fun party? See a great movie?

Run into an old flame with a new wick?

What are the odds?

One brother turns them gay,
and the other turns them guy.

If you don't mind, Berta,
I'd rather not talk about it.

Okay. I'll fix you something to eat.

How about a sausage link
and a couple eggs?

Hello? Anybody home?

Oh, no.

Charlie, I need to talk to you
about your friend, Bill.

- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

You know, I'd really rather
not discuss this in front of the help.

- Berta, could you give us some privacy?
- Hell, no.

- Sorry.
- Okay.

Bill and I shared something
very special this weekend.

I realize that might be awkward for you,

so I thought I'd come by to discuss it.

That's nice, Mom. Isn't that nice, Alan?

You're the expert, Charlie.
Is it too early to start drinking?

What's that supposed to mean?

Mom, how much do you know about Bill?

Charlie, I have no doubt
that you two shared

some sordid adventures together,
but that's the past.

The only thing that matters to me now is

that Bill is a handsome,
sensitive, wonderful man.

Excuse me?

Nothing. I'm just happy to be here.

Frankly, Mom,
I'm a little uncomfortable with this.

A little? I think I'm having a stroke.

I knew it. You hypocrites.

It's perfectly all right for you
to date younger women.

But when a mature woman
gets involved with a younger man,

somehow it's scandalous and immoral.

- No, Mom, it's not the age.
- Well, what then?

Because he's your friend?

I didn't object when you dated
that friend of mine.

- You what?
- One time.

I was 19 and she was a very doable 42.

And if you heard how she talked about
you, you wouldn't call her a friend.

I've heard enough.
I'm going to continue to see Bill,

and if you don't like it,
that's just too bad.

Wait, Mom, I thought you came here
so that we could discuss it.

Please, I came here to brag.
I just needed an opening line.

- Wow, she doesn't know.
- Someone's going to have to tell her.

- Charlie?
- What?

I'll clean your house free for a month
if you let me do it.

Come on, it is a little funny.

When we were dating
you never wanted me to meet your mom.

All right, maybe not so much funny
as ironic.

- Look, Jill. Bill.
- You're angry with me.

Not angry. Not thrilled.

Charlie,
I never planned for this to happen.

I mean, your mom and I just hit it off.

She beautiful, intelligent,
self-assured,

and she's just exploding
with this raw sexuality.

No, listen, fella,

I don't know what they told you
in orientation,

but, Rule Number 1, when a guy talks
like that about another guy's mom,

he's likely to get his ass kicked.

Come on, Charlie,
please don't get all macho on me.

You couldn't take me when I was a girl.

Don't change the subject.

We're talking about you and my mother.
Why haven't you told her?

- Told her what?
- That you're lactose intolerant.

What do you think?

- Stop yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling at you!

Yes, you are!

Okay, I'm sorry.

Look, you need to understand

that no matter how much I hate
my mother, I love my mother,

and I don't want to see her get hurt.

So, you got to tell her before
she finds out the hard way.

Or whatever way she finds out.

But what if she rejects me?

Welcome to the rodeo, Calamity Jane.

You want to be a real man?

Grab hold of those store-bought balls
and just tell the truth.

Yeah, you're right.

We still friends?

Yeah. Sure.

I'm glad.
They're made out of Teflon, you know.

Okay, Rule Number 2...

What'd I miss?

Nothing.
I don't think he's told her yet.

What are you doing here?
You finished cleaning hours ago.

I took a nap in the laundry room
so I'd be fresh for the big show.

Okay, I think he's going for it.

- Wow, that went surprisingly well.
- Damn.

Wait a minute, what's he doing?

There you go.

See you tomorrow.

Okay, we'll make a list.

The pros and cons of continuing
your relationship with Bill.

- Mom?
- Well, he certainly understands women.

Okay, that's a pro.

He used to be a woman.

I'll put con.

He slept with Charlie
when he was a woman.

Pro. No, wait, con. Definitely con.

- He knows what I like in bed.
- He knows what I like in bed.

We'll call that a wash.

- What's the score?
- It's about even.

He's gorgeous.

He can afford beach-front property

and he's got a trunk full of fabulous
shoes that fit me perfectly.

Don't wait up, Mommy's got a date.

.......... ********** ..........

Okay, how about this?
If you let me have Jake this Easter,

you can have him the Fourth of July
and Labor Day.

No. That doesn't work for me at all.

How about I give you
all the Jewish holidays?

When did we become Jewish, Alan?

It's still holidays.

Your brother's a schmuck.

What are they arguing about now?

It's actually kind of ironic.

They're arguing about who gets you
on what days.

That is ironic.

You know what "ironic" means?

No, but I trust you.

What's ironic is while they're arguing
about who gets you, I get you.

And you know what?
It's not such a big deal.

No offense, but let's face it,
you're 10.

I can't take you to Vegas,
we can't double-date.

And when was the last time
you picked up a check, you mooch?

I'm almost 11.

Okay, I think we've got it.

I get him Thanksgiving,
you get him Halloween.

You get him Christmas Eve,
I get him Christmas Day.

- I get him Yom Kippur.
- And I get Hanukkah.

Hey, guys, I just found out.

Jake's birthday is, like, in a week.

Shouldn't we make plans?

You're right, he's a schmuck.

What?

We know when his birthday is, Charlie.
We were there.

But only one of us got a needle
shoved in their spine.

You begged for that.

Anyway, you, me, and Mom are taking
Jake to a show at the Magic Castle.

You invited Mom?

You want to tell her she can't come
to her grandchild's birthday?

'Cause believe me, I tried.

Oh, man.

Look at the bright side.

Maybe we can bribe one of the
magicians to get her sawed in half.

Or better still,
thrown in a wood chipper.

Judith and her sister
are going to join us as well.

Which sister,
the brunette or the blonde?

The brunette. Why?

Just curious.
I never slept with the blonde.

And you're not gonna sleep
with the brunette again, either.

Relax, that was 12 years ago.

Well, thank you.

Let's just wait
till we get a look at her now.

Happy birthday!

A magic set? Awesome.

How lovely.
Perhaps he'll grow up to be a carny.

It includes 14 different illusions that
will amaze and astound your friends.

But, of course, your friends
may be smarter than mine.

- Cool!
- Have fun at the Magic Castle.

Aren't you coming with us?

I wish I could, but I gotta go
to some clown's wedding.

I'll try and come back for cake, okay?

- Thanks a lot, Rose.
- You're welcome. Bye, Evelyn.

Bye-bye. Thank you so much.

Poor soul.

I'm sure she meant well.

Now.

Open Grandmommy's present.

- Clothes?
- Happy birthday.

Thanks a lot, but clothes?

Not clothes, darling.

It's Calvin Klein.

No, it's clothes.

Believe me, sweetheart,
the girls are gonna love you in this.

What girls?

All right,
the other boys will be envious.

The other boys will beat me up.

Well, there's just no pleasing you,
is there?

Almost ready?
Judith and Liz will be here soon.

Liz. Thank you.

Boy, that would have been embarrassing.

Charlie, please don't make
a bad situation worse.

Judith and Liz have been
at each other's throats for years.

- Why's that?
- I don't know.

Maybe it's because Liz
was always more popular.

Maybe because Judith was smarter.

Maybe, and this is just a theory
on my part,

it had something to do with
the fact that

Liz did my brother in the coatroom
at our wedding reception.

Well, no secret why she was popular.

At our wedding reception, Charlie.

In the coatroom.

You were louder than the band.

Hey, you make it sound so sleazy.

I'm sorry. Class it up for me.

Okay, to begin with,
we were on a mink coat.

Goodbye.

And I was wearing a tuxedo.

It's an 11-year-old's birthday party.

You could've at least put on a bra.

Some of us don't need bras.

Some of us have had husbands
and children.

I've had husbands.

And please, would you behave yourself
with Charlie?

- What do you mean?
- I mean,

I don't want a repeat of what happened
in the coatroom at my wedding reception.

That was Charlie?

Hey, soul sisters. Come on in.

Hello, Alan.

Alan, you look fantastic.

I guess single life really
agrees with you.

You know,

doing okay.

Starting over, landed on my feet.

Like a cat.

Hey, Mom.

Hey, sweetie. Hi.

- Hey, Aunt Liz.
- There's my favorite nephew.

Happy birthday, sweetie.

It isn't clothes, is it?

This is a surprise.

Hello, Evelyn.

It's not a surprise. I told her.

You're looking very well.
Slimming down nicely.

Thanks. I recently dropped 160 pounds.

152.

I take Pilates.

Hey, everybody.

Uncle Charlie,
look what Aunt Liz got me.

Awesome.

I don't suppose you thought to buy him
a safety helmet.

You ride with Aunt Liz,
you take your chances. Right, Liz?

This guy? Are you sure?

- Alan?
- Yeah, Mom.

Now that we've seen the dove disappear
up the greasy man's sleeve,

how about we stop for a
little drinkie-poo?

Mom, it's still Jake's birthday.
We're going home for cake.

Okay.

But first a drinkie-poo.

Don't you think you had enough
to drink at the magic show?

Excuse me, but some of us
deal with our boredom and depression

the old-fashioned, non-prescription way.

- That's telling her, Evelyn.
- Now, see.

This one gets me.
Alan, you married the wrong sister.

Why don't you lie down back there,
take a little nap?

Okey-dokey.

How can you not remember the coatroom?

I remember the coatroom.

I just don't remember you.

How can you not remember me?

Do you remember everyone
you've had sex with?

Of course not.

But come on, we're practically family.

Okay, Dad, see this ring?

It's made of one unbroken piece
of stainless steel.

I can see that.

And this one is just the same. I swear.

- I believe you.
- Now watch.

One, two, three.

Hold on.

One, two, three.

Ironic.

Wait, don't look.

Alan, how are those
magic fingers of yours?

I'm sorry?

I have this kink in my back
and I was hoping you could give me

one of your fantastic adjustments
when we get home.

Sure, I suppose.

Thank you. I can't wait.

Wait a minute.
His magic fingers you remember?

Ta-da!

This is really weird.

Yeah. How could she not remember me?

- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

Judith's sister's hitting on me.

She's not hitting on you.
She's hitting on her sister's ex-husband.

But that's me.

Stop taking it personally.

You said it yourself. They've been going
at each other for years.

And let's examine the current situation.

Nothing Liz does with me
is gonna make Judith any madder.

I've already flown my mission.

The only play she has left
is to sleep with you.

Well, that's not gonna happen.

Well, certainly not with that attitude.

Now, come on, you can't say
you've never thought about it.

Liz? No.

Alan.

Look me in the eye.

Okay, I'm looking.

Tell me you've never thought
about being with Liz.

You know, you have very curly eyelashes.

- Answer the question.
- Come on, Charlie.

- It's my ex-wife's sister.
- Exactly.

Sisters are like
the Holy Grail of recreational sex.

Technically, it'd be twins,
but that's such a biological oddity,

it's hardly worth pursuing.

Dad, pick a card.

Okay.

Seven of diamonds?

No.

Eight of spades?

No.

- Ace of clubs?
- No.

Is it black or red?

We'll just have the cake,
and then we'll go.

You can go if you want.

I'll have Alan drive me home
after he adjusts me.

Why are you doing this?

Doing what?

Alan.

- You want him back, don't you?
- No, I don't want him back.

Then why do you care what I do with him?

If you're determined to do
something stupid today,

I'd actually prefer you do Charlie.

So would Charlie,
but we can't always get what we want.

Wow! That's a lot of candles.

He's still 11, right?

You want to deal with the candles?
Is that what you want?

- No, I'm fine.
- So, Alan.

When do you think you'll be
ready for me?

Maybe after the cake.

- Okay.
- Okay.

You just say the word, and we'll do it.

In high school, the word was "hello. "

Don't pretend you don't know
what she's doing.

Her back hurts, Judith.
She wants an adjustment.

She doesn't want an adjustment.

And why do you think her back hurts
in the first place?

So, she does need an adjustment.

I forbid you to have anything
to do with my sister.

Really? You forbid me?
I've got news for you.

We're not married anymore.
You don't get to forbid me.

- I'm warning you.
- What warning?

- What happened to forbidding?
- Just listen to me.

If you lay one magic little
finger on Liz,

- you and I will have a big problem.
- What are you gonna do? Divorce me?

Marry me again and then divorce me?

You want to see a trick?

- Sure.
- Yeah, sure, honey.

"Good evening, sir or madame.

"Have we ever met before?"

So, Liz.

The wedding reception, the coatroom.

Did I ever say thank you?

I don't really remember, Charlie.

Well, let me just say,
long overdue then,

thank you.

Okay.

And not just for the one time.

Over the years, I've actually used
the mental picture of that night as

lighter fluid when I'm,

you know, barbecuing alone.

Hey, come on, that's a compliment.

- Hey, Grandma?
- What?

Now, madame,
keep your eye on the magic ball.

Watch closely.

No, wait.

Okay, now I'll take the magic ball from
my left hand and put it into my right.

See? Now I'll throw the magic ball
back into the cup.

You think it's under the cup?

Do I think what's under the cup?

The magic ball.

Very good, dear.

Good Lord, how long have I been asleep?

Make a wish, buddy.

I've already made my wish.

- Don't you dare.
- Now we're daring?

Warning, forbidding, and daring?

I want to talk to you.

- Are you hearing this?
- I'm trying.

- What is your problem?
- You are my problem.

- Why are they fighting?
- They're not fighting. They're discussing.

I'm a child of divorce, Dad.
I know the difference.

- You're a selfish, hateful person.
- Maybe you should go to your room.

- It's my birthday.
- Ironic, huh?

Hi, everybody.

Sorry I'm late.

Actually, you're right on time.
Here's $50. Take Jake to the arcade,

and don't come back
till you're out of quarters.

Okay. Come on, Jake.

Cool. So, how was the wedding?

It was a circus.

Bye, honey. Have fun.

You were always a cheap slut
and you haven't changed.

I was the slut?
Miss Technically-I'm-Still-A-Virgin.

Girls, that's no way to talk.

Ever since we were kids, anytime I loved
something, you took it away from me.

But you will not take away
my ex-husband.

- You love me?
- What? No!

I'm trying to make a point here.

Judith, if I wanted Alan,
I could've had him a long time ago.

What the hell does that mean?

- You never told her?
- Told me what?

Well, I mean, it's no big deal.

Really.

It's just that

before I asked you out,

I asked Liz out.

You lied to me?

If I had said yes,
you never would have dated him.

So, I was your second choice?

No.

Chronologically, yes.

But in my heart, you were always first.

But in reality, you were second.

And you never told me this?

Well, you can kind of see why.

You know, this

wouldn't have happened if you
were twins.

Okay. Fine.

You always wanted Liz?
Go ahead, here's your chance.

Give her your little adjustment.

While you're having
a good time with my sister,

I'll have a good time with your brother.

Beg pardon?

Don't be coy with me. You know we've
always had sexual tension between us.

Really? I thought it was
just regular tension.

Come on, I've seen you looking
at my chest.

You looked at my wife's chest?

Hey, I'm a guy.

I will rock his world, Alan, I swear.

- You're bluffing.
- Am I? Watch me.

- Come on, Charlie.
- Alan?

- She's bluffing, Charlie.
- Are you sure?

Trust me, she hates you.

Trust me. That doesn't always stop them.

Come on, Alan,
I'll show you where it hurts.

Clear something up for me.

Chiropractic adjustment,
that's just a euphemism?

- Right.
- So, we're really gonna do this?

Wow, I thought we were bluffing.

- Okay, we were bluffing.
- Us, too.

My God, that clown has no legs!

Okay, you see the coin?

You're supposed to say,
"Have we ever met before?"

Just watch the trick, okay?
We'll work on the patter later.

You see the coin?

Now, I grab it with this hand

and I blow,

and it's gone.

Where do you think it is?

It's right here.

How the hell did you do that?

Ironic, huh?

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, Judith. There's the rock star.
Ready for a fun weekend?

Leave me alone.

Musicians.

Alan, that child is driving me insane.

Like father like son, huh?

Really, that bad?

He's been sullen and uncooperative for
days. I think he needs to see someone.

What, you mean like a shrink?

No, Alan, I mean like a blacksmith.

This is clearly a reaction
to our divorce.

He's not processing his emotions
in a healthy way,

and I think therapy
could help unblock him.

- Where did you get that?
- From my therapist.

Who's working wonders with you.

Excuse me?

Who's working wonders with you.

All he does is sit in his room and play
that damn thing. He's isolating, Alan.

That doesn't mean
he needs to see a therapist.

He's a normal 11-year-old kid
who happens to be a little grumpy.

And I'm a normal 35-year-old mother
who is running out of patience.

And by patience I mean Prozac.

Wait a minute.
You can't still be 35, because...

He's getting pretty good at that.

Yeah, well get used to it.

Charlie, what are you doing?

Smoke on the Water.

Okay.

It's not cute anymore.

Make him stop.

You're the one who bought him
the guitar, Charlie.

The bed is vibrating so much up there
I'm no longer necessary.

Well, I'm sorry my son's interrupted
your afternoon debauchery,

but I think he's upset about something.

- What's he upset about?
- I don't know.

I was just giving him a little space
before I talked to him.

You want me to talk to him?

Sure, and I'll finish for you upstairs.

This is a father's job.

Tell him I just need, like, 20 minutes.

Can I come in?

It really sounds like
you've got your mojo working.

But let's try to turn it down now, okay?

What'd you do that for?

Because I love you,
and I don't want that to change.

So how was your week?

Okay.

Anything I need to know?

- Anything bothering you?
- No.

You sure? 'Cause it seems like
something's bothering you.

Okay, you wanna know
what's bothering me?

Yeah.

People keep on asking me
what's bothering me.

- Okay. I won't ask.
- Good.

- You know, when I was your age...
- Oh, man!

Okay, forget that.

- Problems at school?
- No.

- Problems with Mom?
- No.

Because I understand there's some
things a guy doesn't want to

- talk with his mom about.
- Like what?

Well, you know, girl problems,
or somebody's picking on you.

Or you're the only guy in gym class
without hair on his testicles.

She sobered up on you, huh?

No, I'm just being a good host.
And, yeah, a little bit.

- Man.
- Did you figure out what his problem is?

No, but we determined mine
was late-onset puberty.

You were a Mexican hairless,
weren't you?

Did you check to see if he's
constipated?

His mother and I
are going through a divorce,

and there's a lot of emotions
he hasn't processed.

Maybe so, but there's also a lot of
string cheese he hasn't processed.

You know, Judith thinks
he needs to see a therapist.

Why,
'cause it's working so good for her?

Charlie, that's uncalled for.

Come on. The kid's problem is he's 11.

He can't drive, he can't drink,
and his mother picks out all his clothes.

Be thankful he's not in the garage
biting the heads off of chickens.

But this isn't like him.

Trust your first instinct.

Just give him a little space,
and probably by this time tomorrow...

I will have killed him.

Not bad. But why don't you try fretting
the "E" and the "A" string together?

I like my way.

Cool.

What did you do that for?

Look, I'm really happy you've taken up
an instrument,

and I'll be even happier
when you learn an actual song.

But right now, let's just take a little
pause for the cause.

What do you want?

Nothing.
I just thought we could hang out.

A couple of musicians taking five.

Just chilling.

Nothing's bothering me.

That's cool. I'm not trying to harsh
your mellow.

I know there are certain things a guy
doesn't want to talk to his parents about.

- Like what?
- I don't know.

Peer pressure. Bullies.

Skipping class to drive to Tijuana
with the school nurse.

I'm telling you, my youngest once ate
a whole can of Play-Doh.

Stopped her up for two weeks.

Berta, please.

Finally, pooped out an ashtray.

That's the day I quit smoking.

Any luck?

The little snothead kicked me
out of his room.

Welcome to the club.

Yeah, but I'm the cool uncle.

And I'm the uncool dad?

Don't get defensive.
You did the best you could.

That kid has nothing to complain about.

He's never been spanked,
he's never even been yelled at.

And even while my marriage was
collapsing, he always came first.

Well, I'm glad you're not defensive.

He has a great life.
He gets everything he wants,

I deny him nothing. Oh, my God,
what have I done to my son?

Alan, I was kidding.
You're a terrific father.

- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

You're right. I'm always too quick
to blame myself.

- Yes, you are.
- It's his mother's fault.

Attaboy!

Would you like me
to make you a snack, Jake?

I'm not hungry.

You sure?
We've got some pizza left from dinner.

Alan, ease up. He said he's not hungry.

You'll eat when you want to, right?

Would you please not talk?
I'm trying to watch.

This show is stupid.

You're right. Here. You pick something.

Thanks.

Cool uncle.

Stupid.

Boring.

Stupid.

Seen it.

Stupid.

Really stupid.

Stupid.

Dumb.

Stupid.

All right!

Pick a stupid show and live with it.

- Forget it, I'll just go to my room.
- Jake, wait.

Nice going, cool uncle.

Now it's my fault?

Let me tell you something,
between you and your whacko wife,

I'm an oasis of normality around here.

Are you ever gonna come back upstairs?

I'm still an oasis.

Morning.

Morning. Did your guest leave?

No, she's sleeping in.
Please do not let me forget again.

Perhaps you should put a Post-it Note
on your penis.

Yeah, but then I'd have to take down
the sign for the yard sale.

Buddy, I made silver dollar pancakes.

I'm not hungry.

- Come on, they're your favorite.
- I said no.

You know what I was thinking?

Maybe later, we could have a jam session.
You on guitar, me on piano.

I'd rather watch cartoons.

- What is your problem?
- Charlie, calm down.

I'm sorry, but when I was his age,
I had to walk five blocks

in the rain to have a jam session.

Yeah, well,
yelling at him isn't gonna help.

I was thinking that maybe the three of us
could go out and do something fun today.

You want fun?

Let's take him to the Rose Bowl Swap
Meet and see what we can get for him.

Or, we could be patient

and maybe eventually he'll tell us
what's bothering him.

Where's my grandson?

Or, we could scare it out of him.

Granted, I don't know what it's like
to be an 11-year-old boy,

but I do know one thing, sweetheart.

You have no idea
what real unhappiness is.

Real unhappiness is
being totally ignored

by the very people you gave birth to.

Real unhappiness is when
you're recovering from liposuction

and your only grandson doesn't even
send you a get-well card.

And FYI, I only had that surgery so
you wouldn't have a grandmommy

with matronly upper arms.

Well, if he didn't need a shrink before,
he needs one now.

I'm telling you,
you're spoiling the kid.

I didn't have a shrink
when I was Jake's age,

and my childhood was
twice as screwed up as his.

I mean, you're a little cuckoo, Judith.

But compared to our mother,
you're like a fart in a hurricane.

Mom never took you to see Dr. Demerest?

- You got to see a shrink?
- Just a couple of times.

For the night terrors, agoraphobia,
and bed-wetting.

Did it work?

I can pee outside in the dark.
You be the judge.

You know, Charlie,
if you think I'm cuckoo,

simply because I want to help my child
express his feelings,

well,
then I think you have a big problem.

So, Jake. How you liking
that bean bag chair, huh?

- You comfy?
- It's okay.

'Cause we could sit in the little chairs.

You know, sometimes I like to sit
in a little chair.

Makes me feel like a giant.

Hello, Jake.

Well, I can barely see you from up here.

Do you sometimes feel like a small,
insignificant person

in a world full of giants?

Not really.

Well, maybe that's just me.

So anyhow, I was hoping we could talk
for a little bit.

Draw some pictures,
maybe play some games.

Do you like puppets?

Not really.

Neither do I.

But sometimes they help

when I'm in a bad mood!

I hope she gets him
to talk about the divorce.

Yeah, it's a traumatic thing to see
his father kicked out of his house.

It wasn't exactly healthy for him to see
the life being sucked out of his mother.

Excuse me. But that was going on for
years, and he was still a happy little boy.

"He stuck in his thumb
and pulled out a blank. "

Plum, right?

It would be nice if you took a little
responsibility for Jake's problems.

She's right, Charlie.

- Me? What did I do?
- You taught him how to gamble.

You brought strange women
into the house.

You taught him how to curse in Italian.

Your drinking sets a bad example.

Let's get one thing straight.

I taught him how to curse in Spanish.

Okay. Well, Jake and I
had a wonderful talk.

And now I'd like to speak
with the grownups.

Aren't you coming in, Charlie?

No, I'm still trying to find
the toothbrush in the tree here.

Is this Uncle Charlie?

Well, I definitely want to talk
with Uncle Charlie.

Thanks a lot!

No, please, make yourselves comfortable.

Okay, well, Jake and I
had a very nice little talk.

I invited him to share his feelings
with me in a confidential,

non-threatening context.

And after hearing everything
he had to say,

I must tell you very frankly...

Who am I kidding, I got nothing.

That's it?
$150 an hour for "I got nothing"?

It's $175. But that's not really
the point now, is it?

- What did he tell you?
- He claims nothing's bothering him.

He claims there's nothing wrong,
but when I probed just a little bit,

he told me to besa mi culo.

You see? Spanish.

I hope you're proud of yourself,
Charlie.

He's not a sulky little jerk-wad
'cause he learned a second language.

- See what my son's been living with?
- Only because she threw me out.

What? I have a right to be happy.

Speaking of which,
did I leave that girl at the house?

Shut up, Charlie.

- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Calm down.

- I don't even know what he's doing here.
- I'm trying to keep your kid

from turning into a neurotic basket case
like my brother.

Maybe then, he won't marry
a messed up woman.

I'm screwed up
because you're a lousy brother.

- My God, your whole family's insane.
- Hold on, people!

Even cows know

words can hurt.

Jake, you know that even though
your mother and I bicker sometimes,

we will always love you, no matter what.

I know.

And, honey, you also need to know
that our splitting up

- had absolutely nothing to do with you.
- I know.

It's just that Mommy has a right
to be happy.

Yeah, he knows.

And whatever's bothering you,

you know I had nothing
to do with it, right?

- Yeah.
- See?

Can I go to bed now?

Now? Jake, it's only 7:00.

I'm tired.

All right, honey.
I'll come tuck you in before I leave.

- Okay, that's a bad sign.
- It's a symptom of clinical depression.

You would know.

Please, if my kids had gone to bed
at 7:00

I'd have dipped myself in gravy
and danced naked on the rooftops.

She does make a hell of a gravy.

- Morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Morning.

Morning, Dad. Morning, Berta.

- Morning.
- Morning.

So, Dad, what are we gonna do today?

I don't know. What would you like to do?

I don't know, something fun.
Maybe we could jam, Uncle Charlie.

Great.

Dad, can I eat my cereal down by the TV?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

What happened to him?

If I didn't know better,
I'd swear he got laid last night.

I hope you don't mind, but I talked to
him before he went to sleep last night.

What did you say?

I said,
drink this bottle of prune juice.

You feed him nothing
but pizza and pancakes.

It's a wonder his eyeballs are still
in their sockets.

Wait a minute.

Oh, man. Not again.

Jake Harper. Unplugged.

.......... ********** ..........

These divorce lawyers have
a good business, don't they?

Yeah, in the same way
locusts have a good business.

Smells good. So does the coffee.

Charlie, stop sniffing the paralegals.

Look,
I am paying my attorney by the hour,

so just speak when spoken to

and otherwise, you know, just shut up.

If you'd listened to me in the first place,
you wouldn't be in this mess.

I'm the one who told you not
to marry her.

You're also the one who told me
that if I jumped off the garage roof

with a bath towel tied around my neck,
I could fly to school.

The one time you listened to me.

Let me tell you another thing.
If I hadn't married Judith,

there'd be no Jake.

I didn't say you couldn't knock her up.

Okay, let's get started.

- Wow!
- No.

No wowing. No sniffing, no wowing.

- Laura Lang.
- Charlie Harper.

- Didn't you used to date Superman?
- That's Lana Lang.

She was Superboy's girlfriend.

And guys have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

Did it ever work?

- Let's just get down to business, okay?
- Okay.

Didn't the Titanic bang into her?

Okay, Mr. Harper,
the reason I wanted to see you is

because your brother is involved
in a divorce action

where the custody of his son
might become an issue.

Really? Why?

Because Jake stays
with his father part-time,

his father lives with you,
and in the words of his mother,

you are, hang on,
I want to get this right.

Here it is, "A sleaze ball. "

Yeah. So?

So she might try to take Jake
out of your home.

Why? It's a beautiful home.

You should really come see it
some evening.

It's in Malibu. Right on the beach.

My point is, if Mrs. Harper decides
to make an issue out of your lifestyle

we need to be prepared.

What's wrong with my lifestyle?

No, we are not going down that road
at $300 an hour.

Relax, Alan.

I'm going to need to know every possible
thing they can use against us.

- Every skeleton in your closet.
- Oh, boy.

So what,
you want to know about my sex life?

Your sex life, your drinking,
your gambling, partying.

On the beach.

Mr. Harper.

I'm sorry. But isn't that kind
of an invasion of my privacy?

It is, and I apologize for that.

But I handle a lot of divorces,
and believe me, they can get nasty.

Look, I've got to be in court.
So why don't you give this some thought,

and when you gather
the information we need, give me a call.

Okay. Starting from now
and working backward,

I've slept with my brother's attorney...

So, Laura, let me ask you something.

The other day in your office,
you didn't seem to like me much.

I was just wondering what caused you to
drive over here, you know, mostly naked?

Charlie,
I don't have to like you to want you.

Right on.

For the record,
I don't like you much either.

Right on.

Another question.

Seeing as how you're my brother's lawyer
and all,

is what we're doing here,
what's the word, unethical?

Oh, God, yes.

Right on.

Listen, Charlie.

I totally get who you are.
You date lots of women, you're a player.

- That's fine. I don't care.
- You are very special.

I just have one little request.

You can pretty much
have anything you want right now.

If your brother found out about us,
he could sue me for malpractice.

I'm taking a big risk here.

- Man, this just keeps getting hotter.
- But I need you to do something for me.

When I call you, when I want you,
you've got to be there.

Okay. Let's practice. Hello?

- Hey, Laura. What's up?
- Now.

Right on.

- Hello? Charlie?
- No.

Sorry,
but I'm gonna have to speed this up.

Charlie, relax.

Just go downstairs
and distract him while I sneak out.

- You're going to leave?
- I'm done.

No cuddling, no sharing feelings?

- I think I'm starting to like you.
- Save the sweet talk.

Just remember our deal.

You know, it suddenly occurs to me,

I'm usually the one sneaking out
when the man gets home.

Charlie, go.

I thought it was a fun fact.

- Hi, Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, buddy.

- You're here early.
- Teacher's conference, half day.

- Where you going?
- Looking for my Gameboy.

Forget your Gameboy.
It's a beautiful day. Go watch TV.

I don't want to watch TV. I want to play
my Gameboy, and it's in your room.

The parental code that unlocks
the pay channels is one-two-three-four.

One-two-three-four.
I should have known.

I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt your late-morning nap,

or your early-afternoon nap?

I don't nap. I recharge.

- Can I get you a beer?
- Sure, thanks.

Come on.

Hang on.
Alan Harper for Laura Lang, please.

- What are you doing?
- I'm calling my lawyer.

Why?
I thought we were going to have a beer.

Judith is demanding half
of my book collection.

Oh, man.

- Sounds like you need a beer.
- They are rare first editions, Charlie.

Very valuable.

Okay, you don't need
to get your lawyer involved.

You still got your old garage
door clicker, right?

- Yeah.
- So let Judith have the books.

Then one night,
maybe someone goes and gets them back.

Wonderful. Breaking and entering.

- It's not breaking if you have the clicker.
- More good advice.

And it's free.

- So hang up, and let's get that beer.
- Sure, I'll hold.

Yeah, they're patching me through
to her cell phone.

What's that?

That is coincidentally my cell phone.

- Excuse me.
- Hi, Alan.

- Don't answer.
- What's up?

- What are you doing?
- Hang on, Alan.

I'm making a living, Charlie.

I thought you were worried
about malpractice.

I'm more worried about billable hours.

Can you prove you acquired the books
in question prior to the marriage?

- Charlie?
- Coming!

- Why are you shushing me? Hang on.
- What?

- I'm on the phone with Laura.
- Say hi for me.

- Give it up, Charlie. She doesn't like you.
- True.

You'll testify that I bought all my first
edition books before I got married, right?

- Did you?
- No.

- Then I'm your man.
- I can prove it. Charlie's my witness.

- What happened to the TV?
- There's nothing dirty on.

- I'm going to go play my Gameboy.
- No.

Wait right here. I'll get it for you.

Of course he's credible.

I don't know, Alan.

If the right lawyer gets their hands on him,
they could really make him sweat.

Yeah, very funny.

Have you seen a Gameboy
anywhere around here?

Okay,
we'll just have to do the best we can.

I'll tell him exactly what to do
and who knows,

maybe he'll get the job done.

I got the job done twice.

Why don't you let me talk to him?

Charlie?

Why?

- Where's my Gameboy?
- I'll buy you a new one.

She wants to talk to you. Keep it short.

Alan, if I could keep it short,
my life would be so much simpler.

- Hello?
- Now.

What?

I want you now.

You've gotta be kidding.

Charlie, I'm paying her by the hour.
Just listen to her and do what she says.

You're the boss. I'll get right on it.

What did she say?

She wants me to write a statement.

And she wants you to take Jake out
and buy him a new Gameboy.

Why would she want that?

For God's sake, Alan,
you're paying this woman

a lot of money.
I suggest you take her advice.

Jake, we're going out.

I just want to make it clear
that I would never behave in a way

that would negatively influence
my nephew.

What was that?
Is she allowed to do that?

Mr. Harper,
how many women would you say

you have sexual relations with
in any given year?

Excuse me.

I do okay.

Ten, twenty, one hundred?

- Come on, I don't keep count.
- So we'll say, 10.

I don't see the relevance of this.

We are trying to establish
Mr. Harper's lifestyle

as a way of determining whether
his home is a suitable environment

for a young boy.

Okay,
let me just say here that I love Jake

and I make it my business to see
that nothing goes on in front of him

- that is in any way inappropriate.
- You tell him, Charlie.

And it's significantly north of 10.

I think we can move on.
Do you have any more questions?

- You are doing very well.
- Thanks.

Mr. Harper, is it true that Jake saw
a woman in the shower with you?

Okay, yes.

Now in that instance,
the door was closed,

he didn't knock,

and the door was closed and...

And I'm sorry, what was the question?

- Woman in the shower?
- Don't help them.

And most important,
he didn't see anything inappropriate.

Then, what can you tell us
about this picture that Jake drew?

Okay, now that's a totally different...
Whoa, man!

Whoa-man. Woman.

She was in my kitchen wearing a T-shirt

and she reached up for some...

SpaghettiOs.

That's what she was reaching for.

I'd like a moment
to confer with my witness.

You are making me so hot.

I see.

Look, Stuart, we both know you're
on a fishing expedition here, right?

- Maybe.
- Maybe?

You have no case.
This man is a wonderful uncle.

He provides a beautiful home,

and the last time I looked,

it wasn't against the law to be single
in the United States of America.

Oh, God!

Bless America!

Amen.

The good news is your wife has given up
on the custody issue,

but we still need to finalize
the property settlement.

All right.

Now, aside from your books, she's
requested a few other specific items.

- Like what?
- A massage chair?

Oh, no. Forget it. I love that chair.

That was the only thing in my bedroom
that moved when I touched it.

Don't worry, Alan.
I will get you your chair.

I will get you your books.
I will fight for you. I will win for you.

And I won't stop until your wife
is squished like a bug on a windshield.

Okay, let's not lose sight of the fact
that this bug is the mother of my child.

So let's just keep the squishing
to a minimum.

Don't worry,
you don't need a bathing suit.

Once you're drunk,
the ocean's not cold at all.

- Charlie.
- Hey, Alan.

And Laura.

Hello, Laura.

I didn't know you were here.

- Hi, Charlie, Crystal.
- Hey.

Yeah, I guess you guys know each other.

How's that flu?

It's better.

This calls for a drink.
A very large drink.

I'm not getting billed for her time now,
am I?

Charlie?

Okay, I know this is awkward,

but let's keep in mind we agreed

that you and I were just a casual deal, two
consenting adults, no strings, no drama.

I'm willing to admit that trying
to boink your assistant might...

- Charlie!
- Yeah?

Now.

What?

I want you now.

But see, now's really not a good time.
I mean, you're working with my brother

and Crystal took a sick day.

Okay, that's a good point.

Let me think this through.

All right,
there's just one way to make this work.

I don't do threesomes, Charlie.

- Then I'm stumped.
- What's going on?

Nothing. Not a thing.

- Charlie, there's no reason to lie.
- Are you sure?

There usually is.

I'm a little upset with your brother
for getting involved with my assistant.

I mean, it could be construed
as a breach of ethics.

Nice going, Charlie.
This won't affect my case, will it?

No, of course not, Alan.
I'm a professional.

If we're going to make it
to that settlement conference on time

maybe you should put on a jacket and tie.
Nothing too nice.

You're good.

Do you think you can keep it
in your pants till I get my stuff back?

I'm trying harder than you think.

Okay, we've got 15 minutes.
Where do you want to do this?

Hold on.

It's not that I'm not into risky,
semi-public sex,

it's just that I am starting to resent
your attitude.

Charlie, we have a deal.

Okay, Laura, look.

I only went along with that because

you are hot, and it took little to no
effort on my part.

Just make yourself at home, Crystal.
That's the ocean.

Anyway, I think we might be done here.

- You're dumping me?
- Yep.

Now.

You are going to be very sorry,
Charlie Harper.

Yeah, girls have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

The next item is the rare book collection
appraised at $12,000.

Actually,
our appraisers came in at $16,500.

- Yeah.
- Enjoy them.

What?

- I was only asking for half.
- Why break up a collection?

Okay, what's next?

I understand there's a dispute
over the massage chair.

Not anymore. We concede.

What do you mean we concede?
We're not here for conceding.

We're here for fighting and winning
and squishing, remember?

- Alan, I know what I'm doing.
- Okay, moving on to the retirement fund.

- Take it.
- Take it?

- Take it.
- I'll take it.

Are you out of your mind?

- Okay, what else would you like?
- What else?

Judith, for God's sake, remember
there was a time when you loved me!

Cool.

That was quick.

Yeah,
like every other time Judith screwed me.

- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

My settlement conference turned
in to a drive-by colonoscopy.

Charlie, have you ever heard
of a divorce agreement

that requires the ex-husband

- to pay the ex-wife's dry cleaning for life?
- Wow.

Yeah, not just clothes.

Drapes, rugs,

slip covers, even suede.

Sounds like she really took you
to the cleaners.

Sorry.

So I fired Laura
and tore up the agreement.

I'm going to have to find a new attorney
and just start all over.

Good, then. No harm, no foul.

Except for the thousands of dollars
of extra legal fees.

Yeah, that's got to sting a little.

Not as much as having to buy Judith's
parents a retirement condo in Boca Raton.

She didn't even ask for that.
Laura just threw it in.

Lawyers.

But you know what
the interesting thing is?

No, what?

After it was all over

and Judith and her attorney
went dancing out of the room,

I asked Laura
why she had done this to me,

and she said, and I quote,
"Ask your brother. "

So here I am asking you.

Why, Charlie?

Why did my very expensive
Beverly Hills divorce lawyer sell me out?

Okay. I'll tell you the whole story.

But maybe you should sit down first.

.......... ********** ..........

Alan?

Alan, what are you doing?

There are dust bunnies everywhere!

So you're vacuuming dust bunnies?

No. Their poop. It's all over the place.

Are you sleepwalking?

You're stepping in it!
Don't step in it!

Alan, why don't we leave
the dust bunny poop until morning?

- Click.
- Hey!

Come on. Let's get you tucked in,
you crazy son of a bitch.

- What?
- You know.

Okay, that's it, into bed.
Nighty-night.

If you feel the need to get up
and clean something,

maybe you can wax my car.

For God's sake, Rose!

Isn't there enough poop
on the carpet tonight?

What are you doing here?

I'm sorry. I saw your lights come on
and I was worried.

Why were you looking at my house
at 3:00 in the morning?

Haven't you heard
of the Neighborhood Watch?

- We don't have a Neighborhood Watch.
- Well, not yet.

If we did, I surely couldn't stroll in
here like I just did.

Yeah.

- So, what's going on?
- Nothing. Alan was sleepwalking.

- At least, I hope that was sleepwalking.
- Sure.

My parents used to put
a football helmet on me

- and strap me in bed.
- You were a sleepwalker?

No.

- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charlie.

Thank you, I had a wonderful time.

If crazy ever becomes an Olympic event,
I get the first two legs of the relay.

- What?
- Nothing.

Man, I'm living in a loony bin.

Judith, I don't care what all the
other divorced parents are doing.

I don't think Jake needs
to keep seeing the psychologist.

No, I am not in denial.

Judith, denying you're in denial
is not denial.

Okay, this is how it's going to be.

I will have Jake
at the psychologist's office at 11:00.

You're welcome.

Damn it!

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

Were you talking to Mom?

Yes, but I hung up
before I said the bad stuff.

Yeah, she does the same thing with you.

- Hey.
- Morning. Why is the vacuum cleaner out?

Because we were ankle deep
in bunny poop.

- Were you drinking last night?
- Yes, but that's not the point.

- You were sleepwalking.
- Really? I have no memory of being up.

Good for you, because I have no memory
of being asleep.

I'm sorry, I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

Yeah, well, if you're gonna regress,

let me know,
so I can stock up on rubber sheets.

Okay, that was uncalled for!

You want to go to the bowling alley
and play some air hockey today?

Sure, but you still owe me
like $12,000 from last time.

What are you gonna do, break my thumbs?

Wouldn't hurt your game.

Remember, we have Jake's session first.

Man! I thought you didn't want him
to go back to that quack.

I didn't, but Judith and I talked,

and we decided that what I want
makes no difference whatsoever.

Man, you are so whipped.

I am not whipped!
I'm just trying to keep everybody happy.

- Meow. Fit-choo!
- I am not "meow-fitchooed. "

You're right. It's been a long time
since you got any meow.

Are we getting a cat?

You know, this is a waste of time.
Jake's a normal kid.

But it's not gonna hurt to have someone
outside the family he can talk to.

Please. He's just sitting in there
making stuff up.

- What?
- Well, not really making it up.

He and I work out his schtick
beforehand.

Today he's telling her
he sees dead people.

Charlie, I am paying this woman
a lot of money.

Bet you feel pretty stupid, huh?

What do you want me to do?

Judith is insisting
he comes here once a week.

Okay, look, nobody likes divorce,
but there are certain advantages.

One of the more popular ones

is you get to tell your ex-wife
to bite the big one!

- Or whatever you got left.
- Yeah.

That'll help.
Look, it's just an hour out of our day.

Which could've been spent on air hockey
and bowling alley martinis.

It's a small price to pay
to avoid aggravating Judith.

- Okay. I understand.
- Thank you.

You're a big girl.

Okay. Are there any out here?

- No.
- Good.

We'll see you next Saturday.

Doctor, you should know,
he doesn't really see dead people.

Of course not.
He's just trying to resolve

emotional issues
through visualized fantasy.

Do you have my check?

Dad, how come we never got spare ribs
when we were at Mom's house?

Because your mom thinks
they're too fatty.

Fit-choo!

- Is that really necessary?
- Hey, if the fit-choo fits.

Fit-choo!

Are you happy?

- Come on, he doesn't know what it means.
- Fine.

Anybody see the pancakes
for the moo-shu chicken?

No, looks like they forgot them.
Just eat it with a fork.

You don't eat moo-shu with a fork.

You eat moo-shu with a pancake,
like a little Chinese taco.

- Okay, all right. You want a taco shell?
- No, I don't want a taco shell!

I want a pancake for my moo-shu.
I ordered pancakes. I paid for pancakes.

Where the hell are my pancakes?

- Alan, chill.
- I will not chill. I want what I ordered.

And for once in my life,
I will get what was promised me!

Fit-choo.

See? Not a clue.

I am gonna call that restaurant
and give them a piece of my mind.

That's smart. Scream at the people
who handle your food.

- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

Maybe a little tired.
Just been working pretty hard.

You know, my second grade teacher,
Miss Spulvaney?

One time she got mad
'cause there was no chalk,

and they found her in the cafeteria
hiding under a lunch table.

- No kidding.
- Yeah, she went berserk.

That's how we got Miss McKinnon.

- Hi.
- Rose?

How do you keep getting in the house?

Charlie, aren't we past that?

I thought you'd like to know
that your brother is sleepwalking again.

And you had to get in bed with me
to tell me that?

No, silly.
I was already in bed with you.

I just heard him
walking around downstairs.

Alan?

- What are you doing?
- Making a birthday cake.

You and Mom want some?

You handle this, honey,
I'm going back to bed.

- Jake, your grandmother's here.
- Oh, man.

I mean, right here in the room.

Oh, man, Grandma's here!

- I blame you.
- Take a number.

How could we be out of eggs?

"Dr. Linda Freeman, Child Psychologist?"
Who here's seeing a child psychologist?

Jake.

His mom was concerned about, you know,
the impact of the divorce and everything.

- On who?
- On Jake.

I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some eggs.

Jake, honey. I just want you to know

that seeing a therapist
is no reflection on you.

- Okay.
- It's a reflection on your parents.

Particularly your mother.

I think we're gonna get a cat.

- The queen of darkness is here.
- Thanks for the heads-up.

- Where you going?
- We're out of eggs.

And you have no idea why?

Well, Charlie, I would assume
somebody ate them.

Okay, let's go with that.

And then I tried Freudian analysis,
but with them, you know, it's just sex.

- My doctor has a cow puppet.
- Really?

- M.D. or PhD?
- C-O-W.

- Hey, Ma. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'll be right there.

Now, honey, the cow puppet doesn't need
to know about the time

you saw grandmommy dancing
with the Cuban gentleman

in the Neiman Marcus changing room.

What is it, Charlie?

I need to talk to you about Alan.
He's been acting really strange lately.

And I suppose it's my fault.

No. Well, maybe.

The thing is, he's been sleepwalking,

and I remember him
doing it when he was a kid.

Yes. It was shortly after
your father passed away.

- What'd you do about it?
- Well, nothing really.

It seemed to stop by itself
when he was 13.

Right around the time
he started taking those long showers

and relieving his anxiety
in a more direct way.

Got it. So, sexual release
cured his sleepwalking?

Seemed to. Of course, there was
a brief time when the two overlapped.

I recall an incredibly
awkward bridge game.

Okay, great. Thanks.

I had Seven No Trump
and he just walked in

with this goofy smile on his face.

This is nice. Great idea, Charlie.

I figure you work all week,
you got your kid on the weekends.

I bet you hardly even have the time
to take a nice long soapy shower.

- Yeah, it has been a little hectic.
- Let me ask you something.

When's the last time
you had sex with a girl?

Or a melon? Or anything?

- None of your business...
- That long?

- Why do you care?
- I don't know.

You just have that twitchy look of a guy
who's got one stuck in the chamber.

I'm fine, Charlie.

Yeah, sure, I'd like to meet somebody.

But in the meantime,
I'm living a very full life.

I have no complaints. This table is
really starting to piss me off.

Just let it wobble.

You want beer in your lap?
'Cause I don't want beer on my lap.

Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

Just get up here, you jackass.

Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

Hi, Darlene. This is my brother, Alan.

Come, please, join us.

- Hi, Alan. This is my friend, Annette.
- Hi.

- Hello.
- Hey, he is cute.

You are.

You know, Alan, Annette is a seat-filler
for most of the major awards shows.

- Is that so?
- Yeah, it's a big responsibility.

'Cause when a celebrity
gets up to go the bathroom,

they don't want to have
an empty seat on TV.

Understandable.

You know who pees a lot? Jeff Bridges.

What do you say we leave
and go back to our place?

- Okey-dokey.
- Wait, just hold it.

- Everybody, sit down.
- I feel like I'm at work.

- What is going on?
- Nothing.

We met a couple of girls
who took a shine to us.

- Just like that?
- Yes, Alan, just like that.

- God, please tell me you did not pay them.
- Hey, I resent that.

Not all seat-fillers hook.

Well, it was very nice meeting you.
I'm leaving.

Be right back. Keep drinking.

- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

There is nothing wrong with me.
I'm just...

I'm not interested in being set up
with a woman

whose idea of chit-chat
is celebrity pee-pee secrets.

- How about the other one?
- No!

You sure? 'Cause there's no way
you're banging her on your own.

- Why is this so important to you?
- Are you kidding me?

You've been acting nuttier
than rat crap in a pistachio factory.

I figured if I could coax
your Johnson out of retirement,

you'd stop making
invisible birthday cakes.

- What?
- I can't say it more clearly than that, Alan.

Are you happy?

Anyway, I know you only deal with kids,
but I didn't know where else to take him.

This is ridiculous.
I don't need to be here.

I gave you a choice. Take the long
shower or talk to the doctor.

Okay.

Well, if I had to guess,
and that's pretty much all I do here,

I would have to say that,

based on his inappropriate outbursts
and sleepwalking,

Alan is struggling with a great deal
of suppressed rage.

Rage? No, I don't think so.

Come on. Your wife threw you
out of your own house,

she still runs your life, you're broke,

and you only get to see your kid
two days a week,

one of which you have to bring him
to this rug rat exorcist.

No offense.

Okay.

Now, Alan, how do you feel
about what Charlie just shared?

I think he's completely off base.
Yes, I get a little frustrated sometimes,

and when Judith doesn't get her own way,
she just keeps coming at me

and coming at me
like a frigging steamroller.

- Crushing my spirit and my self-respect.
- That's very good.

But on the other hand,
she's a very good mom to Jake.

Okay. I'll tell you what. Let's pretend

that Judith is sitting in this chair.

What would you tell her right now?

Boy, I don't know. I feel a little silly
talking to an empty chair.

Fair enough. Charlie, do you mind?

- Do I mind what?
- Thank you.

Now, Alan,
tell Judith how you really feel.

Well, Judith,

I know you're working through
some of your own issues,

- sexual and otherwise, and I support that.
- That's telling her, Alan.

Charlie, remember, you're Judith.

Sorry.

That's telling me, Alan.

Is this gonna take much longer?

'Cause I have to get to a massage,
then a tennis lesson that he's paying for.

- Tennis? Since when do you play tennis?
- I told you, but you never listen.

He never listens.
Thank God his brother took him in.

- Okay, I am warning you.
- You're warning me?

Okay, Alan,
how are you feeling right now?

- Well, a little angry.
- Really? 'Cause you don't sound angry.

Well, I am.

I just don't see any reason
to make a big spectacle of myself.

Yeah, you'd rather blow off a sure thing
who actually makes a living with her ass.

Meaningless, loveless sex
is not the answer, Charlie.

- Meow, fit-choo!
- Okay.

I am really getting tired of that.

Hey, you know what, Charlie?
I don't much care for that, either.

If you like,
we can schedule another session

to deal with your fear of vaginas.

Now, Alan, the reason I asked you
if you were angry

is because I have yet to see
any genuine expression

of what are undoubtedly
some very powerful feelings.

I'm sorry,
but that's just the best I can do.

Okay, well, let's try something else.

This is called a bataca.

It's heavily padded,
it can't hurt anyone,

but you can use it
to vent your deep, angry feelings.

You're wasting your time, Doc.
He's too much of a wimp.

Attaboy, Alan! Let it go!

Good!

I'm so mad! I hate you!

- Who do you hate, Alan? Who do you hate?
- Everybody!

- Good! Let it go! Keep going, Alan!
- Wait a minute! Stop!

Should I stop?

Well, it's up to you.
You paid for the full hour, so...

Attaboy. Hit him!

Thank you, Doctor. That was great.
I feel much better.

- Good.
- Yeah. We're all thrilled for you.

And by the way, about the... You know.

I'm not scared of them.
I just have a healthy respect.

Fine. We'll see you both next week.

How long am I gonna have to
keep coming here?

.......... ********** ..........

Jake, time to go!
Get your stuff together!

After you drop him off at his mom's,
you want to see a movie?

- Sure, that sounds good.
- Cool. Enjoy.

Why don't you just tell me
you've got a girl coming over?

- I didn't want to rub your nose in it.
- Thanks.

- She's gorgeous, by the way.
- Wonderful.

Why are you putting Jake's stuff
all over the house?

I want this girl to see I'm not just
another jerk trying to get her into bed.

- I'm a loving uncle.
- Who's trying to get her into bed.

That's the loving part.

This is the book I read to
him at bedtime.

You don't read to Jake.

That's why you're going to the movies!

Okay, ready to go.

Is your skateboard still out
by the front door?

- Sorry, I'll bring it in.
- No. Leave it there.

See, I do this thing where I trip
over it, then I bitch a little bit.

I'm harried, but lovable.

- You got everything?
- Yep.

- What about your schoolbooks?
- Oh, right.

So, what time are you expecting
Little Red Riding Hood?

And I'm the big, bad wolf.

Very clever.
And not a bad game to play later.

A little huffing and puffing
and blowing.

That's The Three Little Pigs.

Same wolf though, right?

- Okay, I got my schoolbooks.
- And your homework?

Charlie, if you took half the energy
you put into manipulating

casual sexual encounters and used it
to actually build a relationship,

you'd be a lot happier.

Hard to imagine.

Are you saying you never want
to settle down?

You mean get married?

Let me tell you something, bunky.

If you've got someone to clean your
house and do your shopping

and you're getting action on a regular
basis, the only reason you need a wife

is if you have some sick compulsion
to give away half your stuff.

- What about kids?
- I already got one!

And the best part is he leaves before
we get sick of each other. Right, dude?

- Right, dude.
- Okay, let's go.

- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- See you next week.

- Where are your shoes?
- Oh, right.

I have been so depressed since
the divorce, I've gained eight pounds.

And not one ounce went to my boobs.

Honey, you're still better off
without the rat bastard.

But I miss the rat bastard.

Listen to me, Kathleen.
I thought I missed my husband, too.

But it turned out to be just
a little prescription mix-up.

- Hi, Mom!
- And there's my big boy!

- Don't I get a hug?
- Nope. Gotta drain the lizard.

Boys.

- Hey.
- Hi, Alan.

- He left his homework in the car.
- Thank you.

Hang on, I have some bills
you need to pay.

Great. I hope they're really big ones.

Hi. Alan.

So you must be Judith's support group.

That's funny because
I'm kind of supporting her, too.

It's not funny ha-ha so
much as not funny.

Cookies! Maybe this will take
the taste of foot out of my mouth.

So, who's the little baker among us?

Foot.

- Can I have a cookie?
- Sure, sweetie.

- You are so cute!
- I know.

You have a girlfriend yet?

No,
I'm a bachelor like my Uncle Charlie.

So, you're never going to get married?

As long as I got someone to clean my
house and action on a regular basis,

I don't need a wife.

Excuse me?

I don't want to give anybody
half my stuff.

Okay, bye-bye.

This is my favorite part of the house.
I call it God's room.

Are you religious?

Tiffany, how can you not be
when you look at something like that?

In fact, I'm always telling my
little nephew what's important is this.

Not the big house, or the fancy car,

or all the expensive toys
I'm always buying him.

You are amazing.

I don't know many guys that would

make room in their lives
for someone else's child.

He's family.

What kind of a man doesn't make room
in his life for his own family?

Look, it's my brother Alan,
who I also made room in my life for.

Excuse me.

Bro!

All right, you moron, what part of

"stay out, so I can run around naked
with a hot chick" didn't you understand?

I'm sorry, I'm too depressed
to sit through a movie.

And you figured ruining my evening
would cheer you up?

The movie was just a suggestion.

Go bowling, go sit on the curb,
I don't care.

Leave me alone!

- Who's that?
- Judith. Again.

She's really upset with me.

- Man, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

Now get out.

Get out? She's upset with me
because of you!

That's different.

But still, get out.

Your sexist, manipulative attitude towards
women just got into Jake's head,

and he spewed it out in front of his
mother's angry women's support group.

Wait a minute. Is it a women's
support group that's angry?

Or a support group just for angry women?

What difference does it make?

If they are already angry,
then I'm less culpable.

Okay, what did Jake say?

Not much. He just parroted your line
about how women are only good for sex

and cleaning the house.

Charlie, you didn't really say that?

No.

What I said was is that there is really
no reason to get married

if you've already got somebody
to clean and...

You want to go to the movies with me?

Man,
Jake's going to love this video game.

Listen to this. "Sixteen levels
of ultra-realistic murder and mayhem,

"twenty-four flesh-ripping weapons,

"plus gratuitous nudity. "

Let me see that.

- "Scooter's Magic Tree Fort"?
- Scooter's a zombie.

It's Tiffany.

She still talking to you
after last weekend?

What can I tell you?
I am hard to stay mad at.

Hello? Hey, Tiff.
I've been thinking about you all week.

Yeah, we did get off to a bad start,
and I really blame myself.

No, I'd love to try again.

I'm going to go get Jake,

but I'll leave the front door unlocked in
case Satan shows up to collect your soul.

Wait a minute. Alan?
I gotta put you on hold a sec, Tiff.

How come Judith's not bringing him over?

I don't know. Judith asked me to do it,
and I just got tired of arguing.

She still busting your chops
about what Jake said?

Look, blame it on me.

- Tell her I'm sorry.
- She won't buy it.

Sure she will.
Women are suckers for a good apology.

Just keep shoveling it
on till roses start growing in it.

Poor Satan. He'll come for your soul
and he'll leave empty-handed.

Hey, Tiff, I'm back.

That's kind of harsh.

Wait a minute. Hello?

I see, that's not the hold button.

- Hey, is Jake ready?
- Not exactly.

Maybe you should come in for a second.

Judith, how many times have I asked you
to have him ready when I...

Hello.

- Sit down, Alan. We want to talk to you.
- We?

Yes. Sit down.

Okay.

I guess I can stay for a minute.

- No cookies.
- No cookies.

- Alan, Jake is not here.
- Why not? Where is he?

- He's sleeping over at a friend's.
- What are you talking about?

This is my time with him.

- Yes, I know, but...
- Judith feels she can no longer

allow her son to be exposed
to the toxic influence of your brother.

Wait a second.
We have a custody agreement.

Yes, but Judith feels that
the welfare of her son supersedes that.

- You can't do this!
- Yes, she can.

- Who are you?
- They are my friends.

Wait. What the hell do your friends
have to do with this?

- We love and support her.
- And we won't let you bully her.

Wait. Okay, first of all, can the person
I talk to be the person who answers me?

That's fair.

Okay, I don't want to talk to you people.
This is between me and Judith.

You're absolutely right.
Judith, tell him what we agreed.

Okay. You can see Jake on weekends,
but not at Charlie's house.

But that's where I live.

I'm sorry, Alan, but you're
just going to have to choose

between your son and your brother.

You know what? Maybe I have a problem
with Jake being in this toxic environment.

And I am not leaving until you
bitter old crones are out of my house

and I have my kid back!

All right. You can stay.
But I want my kid.

Okay, I will go.

- Morning.
- Hey.

- Where are the pancakes?
- What pancakes?

You always make pancakes
on Saturday morning.

I make them for Jake. Jake's not here.

- Kind of weird without him, huh?
- Yes.

Would it lift your spirits
if you made pancakes for me?

I'm sorry, man.
I told you to blame it all on me.

Charlie, they had moved way past blame.

It was more like a jihad.

Except with no cookies.

Your big mistake was dealing
with them as a group.

The trick with women is to split them
off from the herd, one by one.

Otherwise, they spook
and you risk a stampede.

Kind of like buffalo.

In fact, I will bet that's where
that song comes from.

Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight

Do you hear yourself?
"Buffalo Gals "? Are you insane?

This is the kind of talk
that started this whole mess!

I didn't write the song, Alan.

- Morning.
- Morning, Berta.

- What, no pancakes?
- Jake's not here this weekend.

Why not?

Apparently Jake took something I said
out of context

and repeated it in front of his mother
and she overreacted, as is her nature.

What did you say, numbnuts?

All I said was if your domestic chores
are taken care of by one woman

and you have an active sexual life
with other women,

you don't necessarily need
yet another woman

with whom to tie the matrimonial knot.

And which category do I come in under?

I got to say it's the sweet loving,
Berta, because this place is a mess.

Morning, everybody. I brought
real maple syrup for the pancakes.

- There's no pancakes, Rose.
- Because Jake's not here.

Because Charlie's an idiot.

Why? I mean, "Why is Jake not here?"
Not "Why is Charlie an idiot?"

Because we know that.

Hello? Where's my grandson?

Oh, God, make this stop.

Good morning, all.

- Hi, Mom.
- Morning.

- So, where's Jake?
- Ask Charlie.

- Yeah, ask him.
- Charlie?

See? Just like buffalo.

No, Evelyn, I am sorry.

I want you to be able
to spend time with your grandson

but I just don't want him
around Charlie.

Why? Why do you think?

That's right.

No, his attitude toward women is not a
reflection on you or how you raised him.

Yes, it is.

Look, there's someone at the door,
I've got to go.

No, Evelyn, I don't think this would seem
less important if I was "getting a little. "

- Judith, can't we talk about this?
- There's nothing to talk about, Charlie.

Okay. Don't talk. Just listen.

I love Jake and I would never
intentionally do anything

- to influence him in a negative way.
- I don't care about your intentions.

Okay, I am a jerk, I am immature,
I am self-centered, I am...

Hi, I'm Charlie.

Yes, we've heard about you.

And I will bet none of it's good.

- I am sorry, what is your name?
- Linda.

Linda. Really?

I once had my heart broken
by a woman named Linda.

Charlie, we are having a meeting.

And I'll bet it was about me.

- Am I right? Come on, be honest.
- Mandy.

Mandy. I love that song, Mandy.

Listen, I know I can't come in here
and ask to be forgiven

for some of the stupid things
I have said in front of Jake.

But I do have the right
to say I am sorry, don't I?

I suppose.

- Thank you. And you are?
- Kathleen.

Kathleen, a fine Irish name.

Half-Irish, on my mother's side.

- Are you and your mom close?
- Yeah, I guess.

I envy that, Kathleen.

- Me and my mom...
- Okay, Charlie, give it a rest.

We are not a bunch of sorority girls
you can charm with your big, brown eyes.

And nice smile.

Thank you, Mandy.

Linda, I admit I sometimes relate
to women on a very superficial level,

but I think that's because

deep down, I have intimacy issues
that probably go back to my mom.

My mother crippled me emotionally!

You, too?

And I am so afraid I'm making
the same mistakes with my daughter.

- You know what...
- Ruth.

That's the same fear
I have with Jake, Ruth.

I've clearly made mistakes,
but that's because I'm human.

And after all, what're we trying
to do with our children

other than to raise them as humans?

Stop it, Charlie. "Our children"?
You have no children.

That's true. Although I don't think it's
fair to throw it in my face.

I mean, some of us haven't been blessed
with the little ones the way you have.

That was uncalled for, Judith.

Look, I'm being real up-front with you
about the mistakes I've made with Jake.

How I've influenced him.

But let's talk for a minute
about how he's influenced me.

How this little boy has made me
a better man.

Dear God! You are not going to listen
to this crap, are you?

No, I will not...

He's lying to you. That's all he does!
Lie! You've got to believe me.

It's okay. It's all right, Judith.
We are all here for you.

Okay, who's ready for a refill?

That kid.

What are you going to do, huh?

Charlie, where's the little girl's room?

It's down the hall to the right,
and around here we leave the seat up,

so don't just drop trou and back in.

- You are terrible!
- I'm serious.

I'm not coming in there with the
shoehorn.

You are getting a little pink there,
Kathy.

Turn around, I'll put
some more suntan lotion on your back.

Okay.

- Hi, Alan!
- Hello.

- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

What's happening?

A bunch of us came over to have wine
in God's room. Why don't you join us?

Thank you.

What the hell?

Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight

Come out tonight, come out tonight

Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight

And dance by the light of the moon

- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal!

What's going on?

- I want my friends back.
- I am sorry, what?

- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- There he is.

How you doing, buddy?
We missed you around here!

- I slept over at Toby's house.
- Cool!

Jake, honey, go put your stuff
in your room.

Okay.

- He's staying?
- Okay, here's the deal.

We go back to the original custody
arrangement, but with one new condition.

What's that?

Charlie agrees to never, ever,
enter my house again.

Done.

- You want some wine?
- Charlie...

Yeah, sure, why not.

How?

I told you, I am hard to stay mad at.

Anyway, they're your problem now.

I am going to hang with Jake
till Tiffany gets here.

What?

You got a normal-sized head.

Thanks. I am pretty happy with it.

- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

I heard Mom say the reason
Uncle Charlie gets into so much trouble

is because he thinks with
his little head.

It's not that little.

- Okay, you tell your mother...
- Charlie.

That women are to
be honored and respected.

See, Jake? That's the big head talking.

But he only has one head.

You want to tell him
or should we let him spin for a while?

I'd rather he spin.

Come on, at least give me a clue.

All right.

What do men have that women don't?

Beards.

- Lower.
- Beards.

You're right, let him spin.

.......... ********** ..........

Hello? What?

I can't understand you.

Who is it?

I don't know. Some woman crying.

Hold on. Charlie?

- What?
- Phone for you.

- Who is it?
- A hysterical woman.

Are you insane?
I don't take calls from hysterical women.

Here he is.

You are very insensitive.

Hello? Oh, hey. How are you?

She's crying. Duh.

Okay, calm down. I can't understand you.

Omelet? What is "omelet"?

Oh, I'm late.

What are you late for, hon?

- Get him out of here.
- Jake, go watch TV.

What's the big deal?
I don't cry when I'm late.

Okay, are you sure? Don't yell.

How did this... Scratch that.

Okay. Just stay calm, I'm here for you.

We'll deal with this together.

You didn't happen
to catch her name, did you?

Okay,
the instructions sound pretty clear.

You pee on the stick,

and if it turns blue
it means you're pregnant.

The stick turns blue.

Yes, sweetheart,
first go into the bathroom.

Not exactly a rocket scientist.

As opposed to the Nobel Prize winners
you usually bring home.

I'm still here. Go ahead, let her rip.

What do you mean you can't?

Hold on.

How's that?

Yeah, I'm a genius.
Now we wait 30 seconds.

Please, God. Please, God, please.

Isn't it a little late for prayer,
Charlie?

Hey, don't mock my faith.

Yeah, I'm here. Did it change colors?

No? That's good, right?

Sure, in a strange way
I'm a little disappointed, too.

Hold on a sec. Yes!

So, what else is new?

Hey, congratulations.
When's the wedding?

Isn't that nice?

Best of luck. Bye-bye.

Boy, don't you just hate
when that happens?

Wait, so this is a common occurrence?
Don't you take precautions?

Of course.

But, come on, you've never found yourself
in a slow elevator without a condom?

Look who I'm asking.

Okay, so we need soap,

razor blades, cotton balls.

- Cotton balls, that reminds me.
- Reminds you of what?

Ribbed, for her pleasure.

Ultra thin, for mine.

Fiesta colors for, I suppose, fiestas.

And extra-strength, double latex,
for coyote Tuesdays.

Boy, if women knew the trouble we go to.

Why don't you just get snipped?

- You mean a vasectomy?
- Yeah.

Then say "vasectomy. "
Don't say "snipped. "

- What's wrong with "snipped"?
- It's demeaning.

Snipped is what you get
for $12 at Supercuts.

Fine. Why don't you get a vasectomy?

I've considered it.

In fact, a couple of years ago I believe
there was a petition circulating.

So, what's holding you back?

I don't know,
it's kind of a permanent move.

What happens if one day
I finally meet the right woman

and decide I want to raise a family?

Don't cry. Look.

You want to see Daddy dance?
You like to see Daddy dance.

Look at Daddy dance.

Who am I kidding?

Sweetheart, I have to go.
I've a patient.

No, you just stay off your feet.
Remember, you're very pregnant.

Huge.

Yeah, I love you, too.

I know. We're going to have a baby.

Yes, we are. Okay, sweetie, bye-bye.

So, Mr. Harper, you want a vasectomy?

Yes. You do that, right?

Of course we do.
In the exam room next door. Snip, snip.

Great. I just have a couple of
pre-snip questions.

Shoot. Which, by the way,
you'll still do post-snip,

if that was one of your questions.

Good.

Of course, if I've done my job right,
you'll be shooting blanks. Yeah?

Yeah, I got that.

What I was wondering is
if there's any permanent effects.

You mean like sexual impairment?

No. Wait a minute.

There can be sexual impairment?

No, I just wanted to see
the look on your face.

No, actually, you'll be able to perform
exactly as you did before.

Great.

But what about like creativity?

See, I write music for a living.
Will I still be able to do that?

Do you write with your testicles?

No.

Then it shouldn't be a problem.
Now, let me ask you a question.

- Do you have children already?
- No.

Then you might want to
think about freezing some sperm

in case you ever change your mind.

- Frozen sperm? I don't know.
- Why not?

You know, you freeze shrimp,
it's never as good as fresh.

That's really not the same thing.

So you know for a fact that frozen kids
are just the same as the regulars?

Yeah, pretty much.

Of course, when they grow up
they do tend to migrate to the Sunbelt.

Nothing? Wow. That one kills
at urology conventions.

Excuse me. Yes?

Put her on. It's my wife.

Hi, honey.

No kidding, she's really
kicking up a storm, huh?

Yeah, we know it's a girl.

- Good.
- Hang on.

Do you like Brittany or
Allison for a name?

- They're both nice.
- Yeah.

Okay, honey, let me get this guy
out of here and I'll call you back.

Okay, Mommy.

Yeah, you're going to be a mommy.

Yes, you are.

So, frozen sperm.

I'm just not really sure
I want to go into some little room

with a bunch of magazines
and you know...

Actually, we have videos now.
Kind of hot.

You don't have to do it here.
We'll give you a container,

you can go home,
make yourself comfortable,

dim the lights,
put on a little sweet soul music...

I know the procedure.

Then just bring it back here while
the little fellas are still swimming,

and we'll turn them into Popsicles.

Popsicles?

You know, in case
someday you want to be a pop.

Yeah. Very clever.

You deal with prostates and penises all
day, you better have a sense of humor.

And warm hands.

That's good, I'll use that.

Warm hands. That's good. Yeah.

I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

Jake, Grandma came all the way
over here to spend some time with you.

Alan, don't use guilt
as a control mechanism.

He should only spend time with me
if he wants to.

So I can go, right?

Run.

Good morning.

- Good morning, darling.
- Morning, Charlie.

Charlie, what's wrong with your pee-pee?

What?

A little birdie told me you were in
a urologist's office yesterday.

Thanks a lot, Tweety.

I didn't say anything.

Coincidentally, your doctor has a suite
in the same building as Dr. Shankman.

The man responsible for one out of
three tight tushies in Beverly Hills.

So, Dr. Shankman saw me and told you?

No, you left your appointment card
on the table here.

I just brought up Dr. Shankman because
no one has noticed my new tushie.

Very nice, Mom.

Of course. It's a Shankman.

So, Charles, back to your pee-pee.

I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just getting a vasectomy.

You must really hate me.

Are we changing the subject?

How can you have a vasectomy
without consulting me?

You're selfishly robbing me
of grandchildren.

- You've got grandchildren.
- Oh, big whoop, one.

If it makes you feel any better,
I'm going to do the freezing thing.

Really?

I suppose that's better than nothing.

You know,
I'm doing a freezing thing, too.

- What?
- Excuse me?

At death, I plan to have my head
removed and frozen until such time

as it can be revived
and put on a monkey body.

What? Everybody's doing it.

Charlie, you got somebody in there?

No.

I need to get your towels.

I really wish you wouldn't.

Come on, I'm doing laundry.
I want to finish a load before I go.

Yeah. Well, me, too.

- What?
- Never mind, just go away.

All right.
If it helps, you can think of me.

Charlie, wait a second.

I don't have to pick up Jake
till after dinner.

You want to catch an early movie?

Maybe. But I gotta make one stop first.
Come on.

So, what's in the bag?

- Sperm.
- No, really.

Sperm.

- Whose sperm?
- Seabiscuit's. Who do you think? Mine.

I thought we were going to a movie.

Yeah, but first I'm having my sperm
frozen and getting a vasectomy.

I could've met you at the theater,
you know.

Just hold the bag.

There is another container
inside this bag, right?

Of course. You just gotta keep it
out of the sunlight.

Why? Is it vampire sperm?

Jeez.
He's gonna want to look in the bag.

God.

No!

- What the hell did you do that for?
- I don't know, I panicked.

- Hey, Charlie!
- What?

Are you nuts?
You can't put that in the freezer.

It's ice cream.

Store-bought, not hand-cranked.

Yeah, you're hilarious.

You're lucky I'm still talking to you

after tossing my swimmers
on the Coast Highway.

- What?
- It's nothing.

Thanks to you, I got to reschedule
the whole deal for this afternoon.

- What whole deal?
- It's not important, Jake.

Why shouldn't he know?

Okay, go ahead. Explain it to him.

Well, Jake,

your uncle Charlie is getting a
vasectomy.

What's wrong with the car you have now?

Well done.

All right, let me try again.

A vasectomy is a very simple operation.

- Are you sick?
- No. I'm perfectly healthy.

It's a procedure so that
I don't have babies by accident.

Yeah, like we had to do with Scout.

Scout?

The dog we had.
Couldn't keep it in his fur.

Keep going, you're doing great.

Jake, it's not exactly the same
with people as with dogs.

I know.

Why don't you just use a condom?

I guess he knows more than he lets on.

- You do, don't you?
- I hear things.

Thanks for babysitting, Rose.

My pleasure. Is Charlie gonna be okay?

Yeah. He's just having
a little procedure done,

and I need to be there to drive
him home.

- What kind of procedure?
- It's personal.

I understand. Where is he?

Upstairs, getting ready.
Throwing a few things in a bag.

- I'll tell Jake you're here.
- Okay.

- Charlie?
- Rose, for God's sake!

- You need a hand?
- No, get out.

- Charlie?
- What?

- What's the little cup for?
- Go away, Rose.

Don't be embarrassed.

That's a perfectly natural way
to relieve stress.

You know what I do? Jumping jacks.

Rose, please.

The only downside is, when I exercise,
I get all hot and sweaty,

and my clothes start clinging
to my body.

So then I have to go
and take a nice, hot, soapy shower.

Then what?

Rose?

Oh, damn.

Look, I'm sorry I walked in on you.

I thought you were finished
with the video and everything.

- Forget it, Alan.
- I wish I could.

Why didn't you hang a sock
on the doorknob?

It wouldn't have helped.

Obviously, a power
much greater than myself

doesn't want me to freeze my sperm.

If you don't, and you go ahead
with this vasectomy,

you'll never be able to have children.

What difference does it make?
We both know I'm not daddy material.

No, not now, or any time soon,

but who knows,
maybe in the distant monkey-body future.

Look, this is my life.
I know what's best for me.

Okay, Mr. Harper.

Why don't you jump up on the table,

put your legs in the stirrups
and we'll get you shaved.

Damn, I didn't bring the camcorder.

- Thanks, Alan. I'll see you later.
- Yeah. Good luck.

Don't forget to put a cone around his
head so he doesn't bite at the stitches.

All right,

Let's have a look.

Okay, in my defense,
it's a little cold in here.

Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

So, what's your name?

Naomi.

Let me ask you something, Naomi.

Does doing this make you want
to have dinner with me more or less?

Just a reminder, Mr. Harper,
I'm holding a razor to your genitals.

I know, but how "meet cute" is this?

What a great story to tell our...

Our what?

Never mind.

- Okay, all done.
- That was quick.

You got a little mirror
so I can check out the back?

Not that little.

Come on, honey. I know. Breathe with me.

All right, that's good.

I gotta do one quick snip
and then I'll meet you at the hospital.

- Excuse me, quick snip?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

Yeah. I love you, too.
Breathe, honey. Just breathe.

Okay, bye-bye.
It's getting exciting now.

Okay,
let's see what we're up against here.

Woof. That's quite a haircut.

Looks like my grandma in a bathing cap.

Okay, Mr. Harper,

I'm gonna give you
a local anesthetic here

so you're gonna feel a little sting.

Just let me know when you're about to.
Holy Mother of God!

Okay, here it comes. Kidding.

I got you.

Now, we'll just give it a minute
till we're nice and numb.

You know, we're thinking Juliet now,
or maybe Julianne.

Both good names.

Yeah, you want a name that fits a child,
but also is appropriate for an adult.

Can you feel my finger?

What finger? Why? What are you doing?

Okay, let's start snipping.

Naomi, could you get that for me?

Hello? Hi, honey. No, I can talk.

What, you're kidding, already?
Okay, don't panic, I'm on my way.

Okay, this is a little embarrassing,
but I have to go.

Why don't you see to it that
Mr. Harper has another appointment?

And no charge for the haircut. Yeah.

I'm gonna be a daddy.

Man, he looks really happy.

Yeah,
they've been trying for a long time.

You can put your legs down now.

Yeah, that's one option.

- Unbelievable.
- Let it go, Alan.

Who goes in for a vasectomy
and comes out with a date?

What? I'm a man, she's a woman.

A woman who two minutes
after you met her

was shaving your scrotum.

So we skipped ahead a little.

- You feeling any calmer, Uncle Charlie?
- What do you mean?

When Scout had his operation,
he got real calm.

Then he got fat and only wanted
to sleep behind the dryer.

Okay, first of all,
it's not the same operation.

And second of all,
I didn't even have it.

- So you're gonna have kids?
- I don't know. Maybe some day.

I hope so, because you'd be a cool dad.

Really?

- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

So, you're not gonna have the vasectomy?

I tried my best,
but it just wasn't meant to be.

What do you mean?

Do you think it was a coincidence
that my urologist was having a baby

at the very moment
I was about to get snipped?

I mean, I'm not
a particularly religious guy,

but clearly a power
much greater than myself

wants me to
knock somebody up some day.

You called?

.......... ********** ..........

The snap, the kick is up,
and it is good! It is good!

- Man.
- Okay, well, that's the game.

Dad, can I have my allowance?

Sure. Here.

Thanks. Here.

Pleasure doing business with you.

You're taking my son's allowance
on a football bet?

Hey, when he wins, I pay off.
You know, minus the vig.

Minus the vig. You're charging him for
the privilege of making a bet?

That's what the vig is, Dad.

Face it. He's not gonna learn
this stuff in school.

I don't care.
Give him his allowance back.

Fine.

You get no allowance.
That's your punishment for gambling.

- Told you he'd do that.
- Yeah, you did.

Pleasure doing business with you.

Hey, listen. After you drop him off at his
mom's house tonight, do me a favor?

- Just make yourself scarce, okay?
- What's her name?

Or is it too early to ask?

It's not a girl.
I'm just having friends over.

Oh, poker? Oh, can I play?

- I'm better than I used to be.
- It's not poker.

Wait. A flush beats a straight...

...and a full boat beats a flush, right?
- Right...

A full house and a full boat
are the same...

...so I won't say
"full houseboat" anymore.

- It's not poker, Alan.
- Then what's going on?

I'm just having some
friends over to smoke cigars...

...sample some fine single-malt Scotch
and, you know, talk.

I enjoy all those things.
Well, Scotch makes me a little gassy.

But I'll take a Beano
and I'm good to go.

That's nice, but I don't think
you'd be comfortable.

- Why not?
- Because we talk about personal things.

- You mean like a support group?
- No, no, no. It's not a support group.

It's just guys who get together
to talk about their lives.

- That's a support group.
- No, it's not.

Okay, it's not.

It's not.

Got it. So why can't I come?

Because these men are my friends.

There's a level of trust
and confidentiality.

- I'm your friend.
- No, you're my brother.

Wait a minute.
You don't consider me a friend?

It's not up to me.

A friend is someone you choose.
A brother is someone you get.

- Excuse me?
- There's no choice involved.

Your dad just wakes you up
in the night and says:

"Your mom wasn't really fat
and this isn't your room anymore."

So all these years,
I've just been an intruder to you?

An inconvenience? A burden?

Well, sure. You can spin it that way.

You know, I had no idea
you felt this way.

I am very, very hurt.

Okay.

But you'll still
make yourself scarce, right?

- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy.

- Oh, he's your buddy?
- Alan, don't start.

How is he your buddy?
You didn't choose him.

- I chose to let him stay here.
- You chose to let me stay here too.

No. I chose him, I got you.

You know, there are times
I just loathe you.

And yet you're surprised
I don't consider you a friend.

Okay, have your real friends
to your little "support group."

- It is not...
- It is a support group!

It's a support group for weak,
rudderless men.

And I wouldn't be a part of it
if you begged me.

Okay, bye.

Dad, check this out.
You can pick your friends...

...you can pick your nose,
but you can't pick your friend's nose.

- You know who told me that?
- I can guess.

Uncle Charlie. And you know
why it's funny? Because it's true.

Yeah, yeah. Have a nice week, Jake.

Bye, Dad. Hi, Mom.
Can I have my allowance?

I missed you too, sweetie.

- Thanks for dropping him by.
- Judith, hold on.

Do you consider us friends?

I consider you my ex-husband.

I know. But putting aside
for the moment...

...our loveless marriage and
messy divorce...

...we always had a certain
camaraderie, am I right?

Can we talk some other time?
I'm having people over for dinner.

Oh, really? Anybody I know?

- Sandra and Howard.
- Oh, no kidding. Can I say hello?

- I'd rather you didn't.
- Why not?

Sandra and Howard are my friends too.
In fact, I introduced them to you.

Well, why don't you call them
and invite them to your house.

This is my house.
Those were my friends.

The fact is, you're having
my friends for dinner in my house.

Yes, Alan, that is exactly
what's happening.

Well, when I'm right, I'm right.

I've got something I wanna talk about,
but it's gotta stay in this room.

Everything stays in the room.

Yeah, sure, Judas.
Does that include veiled references...

...in one of your wise-ass songs?

- I said sorry about that.
- Too little, too late.

We have to go through this
every time we get together?

- It's water under the bridge.
- Thank you.

It wouldn't have killed you
to thank him in your Grammy speech.

That I would've done, but, you know,
Bacharach, he just went on so long.

Well, get on with it.

All right. How do I say this?

Do any of you get up in
the middle of the night to pee?

- Sure.
- Occasionally.

Sometimes, I don't even get up.

This is what I can't
write songs about?

Oh, drat.

All right, look.
It's not about peeing, per se.

It's about getting older.

I'm laying in bed with my wife.

She looks beautiful, sexy.

All I wanna do is finish
my Corn Pops and go to sleep.

What are you doing?

Shopping list. You know,
just a shopping list.

So you're saying
the old flag's at half-mast?

No, the old flag is fine.

And I'd rather not refer to it
as an old flag, if you don't mind.

No, my point is, it's about
shifting priorities or something.

Flag, drag, hag.

I will knock your glasses through
your eyeballs. I will do it.

Let me tell you something, fellas.

It doesn't matter what the calendar
says, you're as old as you feel.

Me, I feel...

...like...

...boiled crap.

- Hello.
- Oh, man.

I'm sorry, guys. It's my brother.

We agreed you weren't
gonna be here.

Don't worry,
I just need my phone book.

- Is that...?
- Yes.

- And that...?
- Yeah.

And that?

He used to be. Not anymore.

Him I don't recognize.

He's our bookie.

You can have
your bookie, but not me?

Bookies, like friends, are chosen.

Okay. Okay, fine.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

I need my address book
so I can call one of my friends.

They don't care.
Hurry up and get out.

Hurry up and get out.
Sounds like sex with my ex-wife.

I don't know if Charlie told you,
but I'm recently divorced...

...and it's been
kind of a rough road.

- Here's your phone book.
- Thank you.

Of course, I guess in hindsight,
I should have seen it coming, but...

- I'm gonna count to three.
- Bye.

Sorry about that. He's bent
out of shape because I told him...

...he couldn't be part of the group.
- Why not?

You just saw him, didn't you?
Trust me, he doesn't get any better.

I mean, he actually thinks
this is a support group.

This is a support group, Charlie.

You're the only one who's pretending
it's about Scotch and cigars.

Whatever kind of group it is,
we have rules about new guys joining.

Well, but he's your brother.

He's obviously
going through a rough time.

Seems like you should be
more supportive, pal.

Hey, I support him plenty.

I share my home with him.
I share my food with him.

I moved my foosball table
so he could park in my garage.

What more do you people
want from me?

Let me tell you something
about sharing, kid.

Sharing is a two-way street.

When you share with
another human being...

...you always get back
more than you gave.

Assuming that you're smart enough
to share with somebody...

...that's got more stuff
than you had in the beginning.

Hey, Dick, it's Alan.
How's it going, buddy?

Oh, good, good.

Listen. You maybe wanna
catch a movie tonight?

Oh, really? You and Roz are
at Judith's too. Interesting.

So in addition to my house,
half my money, and my self-esteem...

...Judith got custody of
all my friends.

No, no, no, I don't wanna
take it up with her. I...

Hi, Judith.

No, no. I'm not trying to
ruin your party.

In fact, I've got a little party
of my own.

Alan, come back to bed. I'm cold.

Be right there, baby.

I gotta go, Judith. Bye.

Well, that's a new personal low.

You know, as long as
we're talking about getting older...

...I was at this club the other night,
window-shopping.

I realize I'm the oldest
guy in the bar.

I mean, I still look good.

But I'm competing for women
with guys who are way younger.

I gotta tell you, I felt kind of depressed,
like maybe my best days are behind me.

Oh, you're breaking my heart.

There's maybe 11 women in this city
who haven't saluted his old flag.

We should talk about
Charlie and his brother.

What? Why?

We've been meeting all these years and
I never even knew you had a brother.

I didn't see that it was relevant.

Let me tell you something
about relevant.

The root of the word relevant
is "rel"...

...which is also the root
of the word "relative."

Your brother is your relative, ergo,
your brother is relevant.

What?

Another "rel" word is "relapse."

But I'll wait my turn.

Hi. Is this Doug Ziskin?

Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Doug, it's Alan Harper.

I'm your chiropractor.
But I'm calling as a friend.

Well, I'd like to think we are.

Forget it. Sorry I woke you.

Hey, neighbor. What are you doing
out here all by your Ionesome?

Charlie's got some friends over and
I thought I'd give him some space.

Oh, yeah. His support group.

He claims it's not a support group.

Oh, please. He also claims
he's not in love with me.

What do you want, Rose?

Nothing. I was just sitting
over there in Charlie's car...

...and thought you might
like some company.

From the minute they
brought him from the hospital...

...everything was about the baby.

"Don't wake the baby. Don't tease
the baby. Don't paint the baby."

Then when he starts growing up,
it gets worse.

Everything he does,
I get blamed for.

He wakes up one morning with no
hair and one eyebrow, it's my fault.

They find him
tied to a street lamp...

...and big surprise,
everybody's looking at me.

Charlie, you need to stop resenting
your brother just for being born.

Hey, I don't resent him
for being born...

...but he abused the privilege.

Even now, with you guys.

I jumped through hoops
to get into this group.

I had to be recommended,
then I had to get to know you guys.

Now Alan thinks he can waltz right
in because he's my little brother?

It's not fair.

Let me tell you something about fair.

What?

Charlie, you know in your heart
the right thing to do.

Fine. You want him so bad,
I'll get him.

You know, Sean never speaks
about his siblings.

All right, back off, Mary Poppins.

You're working on my last nerve.

Believe me, Alan, I understand how
hurtful it is to be rejected by Charlie.

And I found that the only way to get
through it is to just love him more.

That, and every so often, sneak into
his bedroom and try on his underwear.

Helpful tip.

Hello.

- Oh, hello, Charlie.
- Yeah, listen. I've been thinking.

Why don't you take a Beano and come
back to the house and join the group.

Oh, really?
What changed your mind?

I had a small stroke. What difference
does it make? Get your ass back here.

Well, did it occur to you that I might be
already otherwise engaged?

- No.
- Well, I am.

It would be inconvenient
for me to return right now.

Why? Where are you?

Where am I?
Well, that's none of your business.

Are you in the garage?

Oh, please. What on earth
would I be doing in the garage?

Cut it out, Rose.

You're being silly, Alan.
Charlie is reaching out to you.

Yeah, right.
Last time he reached out...

...I wound up tied to a street lamp
on Wilshire Boulevard.

All right. Are you gonna
come back inside...

...or do I have to drag you in
by your big, flappy monkey ears?

Listen to him, Alan. He's begging.

No, thank you, Charlie. I am quite happy
chatting out here with Rose.

Okay. I tried to be the loving brother,
you sulky little weasel.

That really wasn't necessary, Alan.

Yes, it was. You're my friend.

And friends don't just abandon friends
because something better comes along.

Then this might sting a bit.

I have something else to do
and I'm pretty sure it's better.

All right, I asked him nicely.
He said no. Let's move on.

Coop, what's up with your fixation on
women who resemble Tobey Maguire?

I think I finally got over that one.
I went to see Spider-Man 2. Nothing.

Hi, everybody.
Thanks for the invite.

I know I'm the new guy.

So I'll hang back and
try not to disrupt the flow.

So is there any protocols
I need to know about?

Any customs, traditions,
a talking stick?

No, there's no talking stick.

But there is a "shut the hell up" shoe.

Okey-doke. As you were.

All right, I've got something
I wanna share.

The panic attacks have come back,
and I just don't understand it.

Everything is great.
My career, my marriage.

I should be on cloud nine
and instead of which...

...I've got this free-floating anxiety
and feeling of impending doom.

And the diarrhea.

Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that
my panic attacks come with diarrhea.

First the clammy hands, and then the
nausea, and then the aforementioned...

...you know. Sorry.

I changed my mind. I want him gone.

Can we shave his head and
fill his mouth with hair first?

Let me tell you something about hair.

The clammy hands,
that's how it starts.

Wait a minute.
You can't just kick him out like that.

You didn't want him here
in the first place.

But I'm his brother.
It's my right to reject him.

You guys wanted him. Now that
he's here, cut him a little slack.

Can't you see?
He doesn't fit in here.

Of course not.
He doesn't fit in anywhere.

He's a weird little guy who
makes phone calls from the garage.

It's not his fault.

His big brother didn't look after him,
didn't teach him anything.

I'm trying to make up for it
with his son...

...but this
annoying little ship has sailed.

Thank you, Charlie.
You can stop now.

No, I got your back.
I want this twerp in the group.

A problem with that
is a problem with me.

Oh, now you've got my back?

- What?
- A little late, don't you think?

Alan, I'm defending you.

And I'm asking where you've been
for the past 35 years.

Let me tell you
what it was like growing up.

Un-freaking-believable.

What it was like to look up to...
No, to worship someone...

...who on two occasions tried to
trade you for an underwater flashlight.

It wasn't for keeps.

No, no, no.
It's my turn now, Charlie.

All I ever wanted was his approval,
his friendship.

And all I ever got was my underwear
yanked up to the base of my skull.

And the sad part is that
I looked forward to the wedgies...

...because it was the only form of love
that I could get from him.

- That is sad, Charlie.
- It's terrible.

Charlie, don't you think there's something
you have to say to your brother?

Yeah.

Come here, buddy.

Okay, buddy.

Here's the gag

In the words of some wag

She loves my flag

Rally round the flag

Wow, Elvis, that was beautiful.

But, you know, in all honesty...

...I really loved your earlier,
you know, angrier stuff.

You know, "Pump It Up."
Now, that was a song.

I gave you that.

Oh, and while we're
on the subject, Sean...

...why don't you
do funny stuff like you used to?

I mean, Fast Times ruled, man.

Come on, do a little Spicoli for us.

Guys, this isn't funny.

Clammy hands. Nausea.

Guys?

Hey, guys?

Guys?

.......... ********** ..........

Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss.

Must be alimony time.

Go away, Charlie.

Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'd
at least come and give you a lap dance.

- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- In fact, you know what'd be funny?

Where it says "memo,"
write "lap dance."

Give her something to explain
at tax time.

Charlie, you...

Okay.

- So where's Jake?
- Sleeping at a friend's.

- He'll get dropped off tomorrow.
- Oh, man.

- I rented a movie he'd like.
- Oh, what'd you get?

Don't worry. It's educational.

One Million Years B. C.?
How is this educational?

Raquel Welch running from dinosaurs
in a fur bikini?

What is that if not history?

I'm afraid you're gonna have to
watch it by yourself.

Won't be the first time.

What's the deal with that giraffe?

How come you bring it out every time
you write an alimony check?

It's symbolic.

Do you wanna know
what it's symbolic of?

No, I'm good.

I made it in ceramics class for Judith
when we were dating.

All these years I've been shelling out
for tennis bracelets and satin underwear.

Some women aren't impressed
with jewelry and lingerie.

Well, sure, if you wanna
date a dead girl.

Hey, I just realized.

Your name is Al, and you're sending
your ex-wife money...

...so it's "Al-i-money."

Hey, hey, I just realized,
your name is Charlie...

...and you're a moron.

Be that as it may.

If you gave her the giraffe,
why do you have it?

When Judith kicked me out,
I wanted to get back at her.

She took the house, she took the car,
she took the money.

- I felt I had to take something.
- So you stole bric-a-brac.

- Symbolic bric-a-brac.
- Oh, right.

You see, now every month
when I write the check...

...I can look at it and remind myself...

...what a pathetic loser I am.

No, dude. You don't need
a giraffe for that.

Get rid of the damn thing.

You're killing yourself
with this bitterness.

What, you think I'm hurting myself
more than her?

No, I don't think
you're hurting her at all.

You need to move on, buddy.

You're right. You're right.

And you know what would
be truly symbolic of that?

Getting your knob shined
by a keno waitress in Laughlin?

No. No.

Me bringing this back to Judith
and apologizing for taking it.

I like my idea better.

Okay, here's the plan.

I'll bring this little fella back to Judith,
and clean the slate.

Did you even consider my idea?

- You drive.
- Why do I have to go?

Because I am obviously
too drunk to drive.

What does that say about your plan?

Alan, wait.

You can't stop me.
I am giving Judith back the giraffe.

Oh, I don't wanna stop you.
I just want a good view.

Okay, you can stay.

Charlie, look at this. What is this?
"The Harpers."

- Yeah, so?
- She's not the Harpers anymore.

She's the Harper.

That mat is a complete lie.

Yeah, and it's in cahoots
with the mailbox.

Come on, ring the bell.

You and me, we're the Harpers.

Us.

Oh, Alan.

Hi.

Dr. Melnick. Is Jake all right?

I assume so.
He's spending the night at a friend's.

Oh, that's right, that's right.

Dr. Melnick is Jake's pediatrician,
so naturally, I thought...

Oh, okay.

Looks like somebody else
has given your wife the giraffe.

Make sure they didn't forget
the garlic balls.

What are you doing here?

Why don't I just get back in the hot tub
and give you guys a minute.

- Well?
- I came to give you this.

- What is it?
- I made it for you.

- Just now?
- No, no, a long time ago.

It's symbolic.

Alan, you're a disturbed man.
You need help.

Enjoy those garlic balls.

Wow, that was more fun
than I expected.

- Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink.
- Okay.

Wait, wait, wait.

Our pediatrician.

My ex-wife is sleeping
with our pediatrician.

I wonder if she gets a lollipop
after every visit.

You know, you're actually
a very lucky man.

Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky,
Charlie? Show me the luck.

Well, first of all,
if Jake ever gets sick or hurt...

...free medical care is only
a hot tub away.

Well, that's true.
He is good with kids.

I begged her to do it
with me in the hot tub.

She said it made her hair frizzy.

Well, apparently, she's found
the right conditioner.

What if she's serious about this guy?
What if she marries him?

- Even better.
- Better?

How is it better? Show me the better.

If she marries him,
you're off the hook for alimony.

That is better.

In fact, if you saw the big picture,
you'd encourage this relationship.

This guy is a real catch for you.
Don't let him get away.

You're right.
Maybe I should go back there...

...and, you know, bless their union.
- No, no, no.

You provided the woman
and the hot tub.

- That's enough for one night.
- Yeah, I guess.

- Probably even paid for the garlic balls.
- Yeah.

- Could I get some more coffee, Berta?
- Who's stopping you?

Get your own damn coffee.

- Well, Charlie, you're finally up.
- Hey, Mom.

- Where's my grandson?
- He's at a sleepover.

- He'll be here later.
- And no one calls me?

I wouldn't come over if I'd been told
he wasn't here.

Good to know.

Where's your brother?
His car's not in the driveway.

Hey, Mom, I'm not even sure
where my pants are.

All right. Well, looks like you and I get to
spend a little quality time together.

Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regular
Sunday morning softball game.

- Charlie.
- Yeah.

It's Saturday.

Damn.

- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah.

- Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about...
- No, no, no. I should apologize to you.

Showing up last night unannounced.
That's completely inappropriate.

And I came by to tell you
it won't happen again.

So you came over unannounced to
apologize for coming over unannounced?

I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

- Is Judith up yet?
- Actually, she's not here.

She ran to the market.

Up and out this early on a Saturday?
Good for her.

She used to sleep a lot
when we were together.

It was probably just the depression
and the meds.

- Meds?
- Oh, no, it was nothing serious.

Just your everyday little pink pill
to turn that frown upside down.

Alan, I gotta tell you,
this is a little awkward...

No, please, don't feel awkward.

Look, we're obviously going
to be seeing each other a lot.

There's no reason for anybody
to feel uncomfortable.

That's a very mature attitude.
Thank you.

Well, you're welcome.

So let me make you some coffee.

Are we supposed to believe...

...that cavewomen waxed their legs
and wore fur bikinis?

It's not a documentary, Mom.

You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever...

...and the time will come
when you'll regret ignoring me.

- Charlie, why do you hate me?
- What?

Whenever I come, you do everything
you can to avoid spending time with me.

Obviously not everything.

We're spending time together
right now.

You're just staring at the television,
and it's not even on anymore.

I can still see you.

Charlie, look at me.

- How long you wanna do this for?
- I want you to talk to me.

- Okay, I'm out of here.
- No, no, wait, Berta.

- Come, sit, talk.
- Mommy-and-me time over already?

- He hates me.
- No, I don't.

- Please, Berta, I need you.
- I'm done. I wanna go home.

- Berta, I'm begging you.
- Oh, all right.

So why do you hate your mother?

Here we go.

Coffee, juice, and my secret stash
of Mint Milanos...

...from the back of the freezer.

Just a tip: If you want quality cookies
around here, you gotta hide them.

Judith eats Pepperidge Farm
like she's going to the chair.

So tell me a little bit about yourself.
Ever been married?

- My wife passed away.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

No alimony, though. Gotta love that.

Hey, hey, here's a funny thing.

My name's Al and...
And I give Judith money.

So it's... So it's alimony.

- Wouldn't it be "Al-i-money"?
- I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

- You got kids?
- No.

Well, that's a blessing.
What with the dead wife and all.

- Mint Milanos?
- No, thank you.

So anyway, kids. Hey, you know,
it's not too late for you.

Judith is a wonderful mother.

We're not at that stage
in our relationship.

Oh, of course not.

On the other hand, you don't wanna
wait too long. She's no spring chicken.

You know, eggwise.

So I'm having this nice Mother's Day
dinner with my slutty daughter...

...and her idiot boyfriend.

Suddenly, the front door comes down
and the room fills with tear gas.

Next thing I know, I'm belly-up
on the floor, hacking out a lung...

...while the cops are dragging out
Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs.

Come to find out that the money that
I loaned them to open a tanning salon...

...was used to turn my tool shed
into a hydroponic pot farm.

- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

Your daughter came to visit
on Mother's Day.

Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visit
their mother on Mother's Day?

- One year I forgot. Let it go.
- When's my birthday?

- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

- What's that got to do with anything?
- You don't know your mother's birthday?

- Well, not by heart.
- Charlie.

- What? She changes it all the time.
- Just the year, not the day.

Hey, I just realized something.
I can leave.

Fine. But before you go,
just tell me one thing.

- What?
- Why do you hate me?

Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l... Rose!

No, no, no. Rose, wait.
Rose, come on in.

Look, my mom's here.
You like my mom.

- Oh, sure. Hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, dear.

- Are those my pants?
- Oh, no.

I bought these.

But I think this might be
your wallet and keys.

Evelyn, you get younger
every time I see you.

Oh, aren't you a dear.
And thank you for the birthday card.

- Oh, did you get it on time?
- Yes, I did, and it was lovely.

So sweet of you to remember me.

How could anybody
forget your birthday?

Well, yeah. You know, she does become
a little emotional at times, huh?

I thought she was getting over
your divorce.

No, no. She was over the divorce
while I was still packing.

No, what you're seeing
is low blood sugar.

The trick to that is to always have
some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket.

- It'll perk her right up.
- Really?

Oh, yeah.
Oh, and here's another tip.

When she starts crying for no reason,
and she will...

...never say, "Don't cry."
And try not to touch her.

- Okay.
- Or whistle.

Never, ever whistle.

Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two.
Maybe I don't return every single call.

But that doesn't mean I hate her.

Was he breast-fed?

Of course he was.
Not by me personally.

That's interesting.
I see the bras that come through here...

...and he does tend to favor
the big yams.

- I do not.
- Oh, really?

- Raquel Welch.
- Hey, that's a damn fine film.

Come to think of it,
the night we were together...

...he did spend a freakish amount of time
on my boobies.

I mean, foreplay is one thing, but,
golly, it was like making love to a cat.

Rose, for God's sake,
you're talking to my mother.

Sorry. A very giving cat.

He's always had an oral fixation.

When he was little, he used to
suck on other children's thumbs.

And now he's always got a bottle
of booze in his mouth.

My therapist says that's his way
of stuffing his feelings.

- That's what my therapist says.
- Hell, I could've told you that for free.

- Hey, I'm here.
- Hey, it's Jake.

Back from his sleepover.
Look who's here to see you, buddy.

Hi, Grandma.

Hello, sweetheart.
Thank you for the lovely birthday card.

- My mom picked it out.
- Oh, and you love her, don't you?

- Sure.
- Thank you. You can go now.

- Can I go too?
- We're not done with you.

- Where were we?
- We were trying to figure out...

...why Charlie hates you.
- Yeah.

Well, Charlie?

Okay, fine, here it is.

I'm not saying I hate you,
but if I did...

...it might have to do with the fact that
you're a narcissistic bloodsucker...

...who drove my father
into an early grave.

Then married a succession of men who
couldn't care less about Alan and me...

...which was fine with you...

...because you looked at us
like dancing monkeys...

...you could just haul out
whenever it suited you.

And when it didn't, you sent us off
to boarding school or camp...

...or that kibbutz in Israel,
where we got beat up...

...because we weren't even Jewish!

And now, now you show up here
every chance you get...

...to lay a guilt trip on me...

...for not appreciating my cold,
Ionely, loveless childhood.

Well...

...obviously you're not ready
to talk about it.

- Alan, you really don't have to do this.
- Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor.

If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'd
treat him, prescribe something.

But it's nothing,
I think I just slept wrong.

Oh, that's probably because
you're not used to our bed.

So have you...? Have you met
Judith's parents?

- No.
- Oh, they are just gonna love you.

They were devastated by the divorce.

Not to mention some of her
unfortunate choices thereafter.

- Unfortunate choices?
- Oh, you know, that's not important.

What's important is they're just gonna
be relieved to see she's dating a man.

You carry a lot of tension up here.

Alan.

- Didn't you just pay your alimony?
- This is the pediatrician's bill.

- Jake was sick?
- No, no.

The pediatrician had to see
an orthopedist.

You know Mom's birthday
was a couple weeks ago?

Yeah, I sent her some flowers
and a card.

Oh, man. Would it have killed you
to put my name on the card?

I did put your name on it. I wrote,
"Love, your sons, Alan and Charlie."

- Damn.
- What?

She tricked me into thinking I forgot.

.......... ********** ..........

I don't know what he did, Charlie.

The teacher called
and told me to come get him.

I want it on the record
that if the kid was running...

...a blackjack game under bleachers
he didn't get it from me.

What? I said, he didn't.

Well, I can assure you he did not learn
that kind of crass behavior from me.

Maybe I should wait in the hall.

Hold on.
What is he doing here?

Well, my car is in the shop, and Charlie
was nice enough to give me a ride.

No, Charlie was nice enough to call you
a cab, but you wouldn't take it.

So, what's going on?

Your son gave his teacher the bird.

Okay, I want it on the record
that he didn't necessarily...

Charlie, just leave it alone.
What exactly happened?

I was writing on the board
and he thought I couldn't see him.

- Is this true?
- Yeah, I really thought she couldn't see.

I'm afraid this kind of behavior
is grounds for suspension.

- Maybe we can catch a matinee.
- Yeah.

Jake, why did you flip
Miss Pasternak off?

Excuse me. We don't end our sentences
with prepositions.

We say,
"Why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?"

I think that answers your question.

Jake, why did you flip off
Miss Pasternak?

Because she picks on me.

Jake, I don't treat you any differently
than any of the other students.

- Yeah, right.
- Shut up.

You know, I'd like to talk
to your parents alone.

- Come on, Jake.
- What, I don't even get to tell my side?

Buddy, you're 11.
You have no side.

This isn't my fault. I was provoked.

- You were provoked?
- Yeah, it means...

I know what it means.

And it doesn't matter.
What you need to do now is apologize.

- But I'm not sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

Just say it and look it. You've got those
big, cute kid eyes. Use them.

- That would be lying.
- That's your line in the sand?

You muttonhead, you just flipped off
your teacher.

- Yeah, but I was being honest.
- And look where it got you.

I think I just lost my innocence.

He's really a very well-behaved boy...

...but he has had some problems
dealing with our separation.

That's true. Although it wasn't so much
a separation as a kicking out.

I sympathize, but if I gave
special consideration to every child...

...whose parents are going through
divorce, I'd be getting the finger all day.

We're not saying
he shouldn't be punished.

- He certainly should.
- But just let us try to handle it.

By "us" he means me.
I always have to be the bad guy.

You're better at it than me.

Than I.

You are such an ass.

- Can we have a moment, please?
- I think that'd be a good idea.

And it's,
"May we have a moment, please?"

Stop it.

Miss Pasternak.
I'm sorry, we haven't officially met.

- I'm Jake's uncle, Charlie.
- Hello.

And I am really sorry.
This may not be my place...

...and if it's not,
I am really sorry...

...but Jake has something
he wants to say.

I am really sorry.

- And I'm really sorry too.
- Why are you sorry?

The kid may have gotten
the rude gesture from me.

I'm not used to being around children
and, well, I am really sorry.

Well, thank you. I appreciate it,
but it doesn't change what Jake did.

You're right.
You're absolutely right.

Jake, go to the vending machine...

...and get Miss Pasternak
a peach Snapple and a bag of Skittles.

It is Miss Pasternak, right?

Now, this one's called
"Read Between the Lines."

You're giving the finger,
but you've got plausible deniability.

Cool. Like the Itchy Eye.

Exactly. Now, this one's called
"the Slow Crank."

Charlie.

As you can see, it's effective
but lacks deniability.

- Dad, check it out. Balloon Finger.
- Okay, that's enough.

Do we need to be teaching him
more ways to flip people off?

Flip off people.

Charlie, do you realize how close
he came to being suspended today?

- I do.
- And do you understand...

...how lucky we are Miss Pasternak
decided to give him a chance?

Lucky? Sure, why not.
Let's call it luck.

What does that mean?

It means I'm too modest
to call it skill.

- Hey, Dad.
- What?

How come only one finger
is the bad finger?

I don't know, Jake.

This one's okay, right?

Right.

- Dad.
- What?

Anything?

No.

I don't get it. Who decides?

Uncle Charlie, I had a weird dream.

And it's getting weirder.

Hey, buddy.
Why aren't you asleep?

I'm hoping I am.

- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Miss Pasternak.

Listen, buddy, Miss Pasternak and I
are kind of having a sleepover.

Because we're like, you know, friends.

No way.

Jake, I'm only your teacher
from 8: 15 to 3:00.

After that I'm just a person
like anybody else.

This is more wrong than the time
I saw Santa peeing at the mall.

Okay, why don't we wrap up this
after-school special and call it a night.

Don't worry. This won't change
anything between us at school.

So you're still gonna be mean to me?

That's right.
Same old junkyard dog.

- Come on, buddy. Get some sleep.
- Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.

- Do you think he'll be okay?
- Sure.

He's just not used to seeing his teacher
out of the classroom.

And her pants.

I'll talk to him in the morning
and make sure he's okay...

...and that he keeps this to himself.
- Thank you, Charlie.

Oh, Miss Pasternak.

Why do you never call me
by my first name?

I don't know.
This just seems way hotter.

- Charlie?
- Yes, Miss Pasternak.

Do you think Jake believes
we're just friends?

Why not? We are, right?

I mean, once I get to know you better
I'm pretty sure I'd consider you a friend.

Charlie, we both know
there's much more than friendship...

...going on between you and me.
- Much more?

How much more?

Well, I know this is pretty quick
and I don't wanna use the L word...

- Good. Thank you.
...but this feels an awful lot like love.

I'm sorry, which L word
didn't you want to use?

Oh, Charlie. Come on.

- Let's go to sleep.
- Yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.

- Morning. What are you doing?
- Morning.

Making my world-famous huevos
rancheros for my brother and nephew.

No kidding. What stupid thing did you do
you're trying to make up for?

Why do you always just assume that...?

I slept with Jake's teacher.

Oh, Charlie, did you learn nothing
from the den-mother fiasco?

It gets worse. The kid found out.

- What about your brother?
- He doesn't know yet.

Oh, hey, you made breakfast.
What's the occasion?

No occasion. Just trying to help out.

Well, thank you. I really appreciate it.
Good morning, Berta.

Morning, you goofy, clueless bastard.

Nice to see her in a pleasant mood
for a change.

Yeah. Sit down.

Have some huevos.

- Fresh-squeezed orange juice.
- You squeezed this?

No, it says it on the can.

Okay, what stupid thing did you do?

Well, funny thing...

I slept with Miss Pasternak.

Charlie, what were you thinking?

What if Jake finds out?

Okay...

Oh, no! Oh, no! How?

- He woke up in the middle of the night...
- You brought her here?

Did you learn nothing
from the den-mother fiasco?

- Hey, I kept him from getting suspended.
- Oh, that's how?

- You're welcome.
- Are you crazy?

No, but I have a sneaking suspicion
Miss Pasternak may be.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

Oh, that makes me feel much better.

So how did Jake take it?
Did he freak out?

Not as much as you.

- Morning.
- See? He's fine.

Jake, do you wanna talk about
what you saw last night...

...with Uncle Charlie
and Miss Pasternak?

Oh, God. That really happened?

Good, Alan. Way to go.

Dad, can I be homeschooled?

Listen, Jake. Don't worry.

You go to school,
don't say anything to anybody.

I'll tell her I can't see her anymore
and we'll forget this happened.

Man, it's like Cub Scouts
all over again.

- I hope you saved room for dessert.
- I saved room for you.

You sure?
Because I'm just empty calories.

How about a nice fruit cup?

Two fruit cups, please.

Listen, Delores. We need to talk.

Oh, call me Miss Pasternak.

No, let's keep this friendly.

Dolores, you're a terrific woman and
I've enjoyed being with you very much...

...but I know deep in my heart
that you can do so much better than me.

- Okay. I understand.
- Good. Thank you.

You're insecure. But don't worry.
I am not going to abandon you.

No, no, no, that's not
what I'm worried about.

See, Delores...

I'm a bad man.

I'm a player.
I go from woman to woman and then...

Charlie, that's the past.

I'm not going to give up on us,
and you wanna know why?

Why?

Because somebody told me
that we belong together.

Really?
It can't be somebody who knows me.

Oh, he knows you very well.

And he loves you even more than I do.

Our union has been ordained, Charlie.

What? Come again?

After we fornicated...

...I prayed for forgiveness
and I was told not to worry about it.

By the same guy?

There's only one guy, Charlie.

And his loving hand has been guiding me
ever since I quit pole dancing in Reno.

No kidding. Which club?

- Did you dress like a schoolteacher?
- It doesn't matter.

What matters is the same hand
that delivered me...

...from my life of degradation
has brought me to you.

For what? More degradation?

No. To help you become a better man.
To achieve your potential.

Now sit up straight
and eat your fruit.

- All right.
- All right, what?

All right, Miss Pasternak.

Hey, Charlie. Guess who.

I know we didn 't make plans for tonight
but we really should get together...

... and talk more about this path
we are on and where it's heading.

We know where it's heading
but it would mean a lot to me...

... to hear the words come out
of your mouth.

Your beautiful, blessed mouth.

Call me, sweetheart.

Boy, it's weird being on the other side
of one of these calls.

I can imagine. Well?

- Professional opinion?
- Please.

Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

Yeah, I thought so.

I mean, she barely knows you.

Where does she get off
being so forward?

Rose, we had one night together and you
handcuffed yourself to my refrigerator.

That was different.
We were meant to be together.

Okay, I was gonna ask you
the best way to end this...

...but I realize now that breakups
may be outside your area of expertise.

Yeah. I do mate for life.
I'm like a penguin that way.

Plus, I like to slide across the ice
on my belly.

Uncle Charlie, guess what happened
with Miss Pasternak today.

- I'm just about to break up with her.
- Oh, no, don't, don't.

- Why not?
- Look at this.

Hey, you got an A in history.

- Way to go, Jake.
- Look at his answers.

"Abraham Lincoln signed
the Emancipation Proclamation in pen."

For this he got an A?

Everybody got an A.
She was, like, happy all day.

She even gave me back
my fake dog poop.

Charlie, I gave you this poop.

You broke into my house
and left it on my pillow.

Still, you regifted.

And I thought you were a classy guy.

Jake, why don't you go to your room
and do your homework.

She didn't give us any.
First time ever.

I love you, Uncle Charlie.

- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

Yeah, I think you know
what you have to do.

- Break up with Miss Pasternak, right?
- Hell, no. He's getting A's.

He hasn't gotten an A
since naptime in kindergarten.

- But he's not learning anything.
- Charlie, get your priorities straight.

I'm trying to get him
into a decent middle school.

After he's accepted he can learn
that Sacajawea...

...wasn't "a bag full of jawea."

- Ready for dinner?
- Charlie!

It's so good to see you.

It's okay to see you too.

- Charlie.
- What?

- Gum.
- Oh, sorry.

What a great day I had.

All the kids were so well-behaved.
Even Jake.

- That's nice.
- Can I tell you a little secret?

I never really cared for Jake.

But you said you treated him
like all the other kids.

Well, you have to say that.

So where are we going to dinner?

I hadn't really decided.

You came unprepared?

Charlie, you have so much potential
if only you'd apply yourself.

All right, I gotta tell you.

My weirdness bar for chicks
is pretty high...

...but you are clearing it
in street shoes.

You're mad at me.

- No, no.
- Yes, you are.

- No, no. Not... Not mad.
- Then what's your problem?

Nothing. Forget it.
Let's just have a nice evening.

Oh, Charlie, that is so sweet.

Let's never fight again.

Oh, no. I hate it.

Hey, can I use the restroom?

May I use the restroom?

Oh, right.

- May I?
- You're excused.

Thank you.

Charlie.

Look, I'm really sorry
it didn't work out with Miss Pasternak.

You gotta know,
I went the extra mile to make her happy.

Alan, you know what that means,
and Jake, you'll understand someday.

Oh, come on, guys.
I said I'm sorry.

Okay, she's being really unfair
with all this homework.

You know what I'll do?
I'm gonna complain to the principal.

Maybe you should date the principal.

Very funny.

Is that an option?

Because I would if it would get me
out of writing 2500 words...

...on The Red Badge of Courage.

Man, book reports suck.

- Dad.
- Yeah?

Please keep him away
from my karate teacher.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

You had the "just say no" talk
with Jake, right?

Of course. Why?
What talk did you have with him?

No talk, it's just that he's...

It'll be more fun if you see it.

I'm guessing you don't mean
fun for me.

Tell the truth.
How proud do you feel at this moment?

What the hell is he doing?

I don't know. Ten bucks says he hits the
ceiling if we turn on the garbage disposal.

- Jake, what are you doing?
- Breathing.

Breathing. Any particular reason
you're doing that in the sink?

I have to practice.

Man, the girls are gonna love him
when he grows up.

- Jake?
- Yes?

- I'll bring him up.
- Yeah.

Hey, that's not funny.
I could have drowned.

And then we'd have found your body
days later, washed up on the dish rack.

- Where did you get all this snorkel stuff?
- Greg bought it for me.

- Greg?
- Yeah, you know, Dr. Melnick...

...Mom's boyfriend.
He's a real cool guy.

He's gonna teach me how to scuba-dive
after I learn to snorkel.

We're gonna need a bigger sink.

He's got a gigantic boat with bedrooms
on it, and scuba tanks and wet suits.

We're gonna go diving off Catalina. Wait
till you see the flippers he bought me.

Well, Judith's boyfriend
sounds like quite a guy.

- Yeah.
- You okay with that?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

This can be a sensitive area
for divorced guys.

- I know.
- Ex-wife sleeping with another man.

- Son starting to bond with him.
- Yeah. Yeah.

- Big boat.
- Charlie, what's your freaking point here?

No point. Just drilling for the nerve.

So, what do you think? You wanna go
bowling today? Maybe catch a movie?

No, I'm gonna take another bath.

He does know there's an ocean
out there, right?

Well, Greg doesn't want him
in the ocean.

He wants him to spend time
training in a pool.

In fact, my son's a little unhappy
about being here...

...because he wanted to go snorkeling
in Greg's pool.

He's got a boat and a pool?

I guess you can afford
cool stuff...

...when you don't have to sell your blood
and sperm to make alimony payments.

Hey, hey, my relationship with my son
is not based on having cool stuff.

And lucky for you.

- Come on, look at the bright side.
- What bright side, Charlie?

Delineate the bright side.

Maybe one weekend Greg will let us
take a couple of chicks out on the boat.

Why on earth
would he lend us his boat?

He's tight with Jake,
we're tight with Jake. We've got an in.

Are you not hearing my pain? My son
likes Judith's boyfriend better than me.

Hey, I don't even know him
and I like him better than you.

You'd think I'd learn.

Alan. Alan, your son loves you.
You're a big influence on him.

- You are the most important role model.
- Oh, I guess.

I mean, so what if you can't teach him
to scuba-dive.

For that matter,
you can't teach him to ski...

...or hit a curve ball
or anything cool, really.

But you bring plenty of other things
to the table.

Thank you, God.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Always a price, isn't there?

- Hello, Alan.
- Jake's taking a bath.

As much as I'd love to spend time
with my grandson, I'm in a hurry.

Need to borrow your Mercedes.

Well, since you're in a hurry,
I'll give you a quick answer. No.

Charlie, please.
I'm showing a house in half an hour.

What's wrong with that
little electric car you bought?

Nothing, it's fine. It's what anybody
who cares about this planet is driving.

If you're trying to sell real estate
to a Saudi oil prince...

...you can't be driving up in some little
toy car with a plug in the bumper.

You could use my car, Mom.

You see? Now, that is how a loving son
treats his mother.

Thank you, sweetheart,
but I need to look successful.

- Charlie, your Mercedes.
- No, forget it.

- Charlie, I am not leaving until you give...
- Happy motoring.

Thank you.

My car is in your driveway.

And if you lose power,
there's a kite and a key in the trunk.

For the record, there are other ways
of measuring success besides cars.

You're right. There's boats and pools.

You know what? I hope Mom puts a dent
in your big, shiny, new Mercedes.

Hey, don't say that.

If you're gonna hope for something,
hope she drives it off a cliff.

So this is pretty cool, huh, Jake?
An electric car.

I guess. What happens
when the batteries run out?

You plug it in and recharge it.

But what if there's a blackout?

You sit in the back seat
with a pistol...

...and wait for the looters,
just like any other car.

- Charlie.
- It's a cool car, Jake.

Greg has a really cool car.
He has a Hummer.

You know, your Uncle Charlie's
no stranger to Hummers.

Charlie.

That's a cool car too, Jake.

So, Jake, this is pretty cool, huh?

Driving in a futuristic car,
going to see a movie.

Hey, maybe afterwards
we can go get some pizza.

Sure.

And then, who knows, maybe...
Maybe your old dad will buy you...

...an excessively violent and bloody
video game. How's that sound?

Okay.

You know,
when we go scuba diving...

...Greg's gonna teach me
how to steer his boat.

Well, I am sorry, Jake,
but, you know, I don't have a boat.

I don't have a Hummer, and
I don't know how to scuba-dive.

It's okay, Dad. Greg does.

Hey, Jake, how'd you like your dad
to teach you how to drive a car?

- What?
- Really?

Charlie, he's 11.

So? We'll find an empty parking lot.

- What if he hits something?
- Alan, it's Mom's car.

Guess what? Daddy's gonna teach you
how to drive.

Cool.

Can you reach the pedals?

- Yeah. Can we turn on the radio?
- Forget the radio.

Which one's the window squirter?

Okay, forget the squirter.
Now, come on, focus.

This is your rear-view mirror. It's very
important to check it before you back up.

- Okay.
- Now... Well, what do you see?

The top of Uncle Charlie's head.

A shopping cart, a tree, soda can.

- Looks like Mountain Dew.
- Okay.

Forget the rear-view mirror. We're just...
We're just gonna go forward.

Now, you know, this is the brake
and this is the gas.

Thought it was electric.

He's got you there, Alan.

Okay, this is the brake
and this is the electric.

They're very, very sensitive.
You don't have to press hard.

Okay.

Now, give it a little tap.

- It is on?
- No.

- Brake! Brake! Brake!
- Brake! Brake! Brake!

Okay. Apparently it is on.

- This is awesome.
- You see how careful you have to be?

And how much closer we are
to the Dumpsters?

- Can I squirt the windows now?
- No.

Now... Okay, why don't you turn
the wheel slightly to the left...

...and very gently press down on...

Brake! Brake! Brake!

Remember, if you wanna drive
Grandma's car again...

...you can't be telling her about it.
- I know.

Or Mom, or anybody else.
Daddy doesn't need the grief.

That was really cool, Dad. Thanks.

- Yeah. Yeah, it was.
- Hey, it just occurred to me.

If Greg's here, we can ask him
about going out on the boat.

No, I'm not going to ask Greg
about going...

Hi, Judith.
Here he is, safe and sound.

- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom. Guess what we just did.

- What?
- Nothing in particular.

That's a kids' joke.
"Nothing in particular."

He's been doing it to us all weekend.

- So, well, okay. Bye.
- Alan.

Alan.

Ask about the boat.

- Listen, next weekend...
- Yeah, yeah.

I know. You and Greg
are taking Jake scuba diving.

No, that's the thing.

Greg and I have decided
not to see each other.

So if you haven't made any plans,
you can have Jake.

Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to have him.

And I'm sorry to hear
about you and Greg.

- Thank you.
- Is there anything I can do?

Yeah, you can wipe that smirk
off your face.

- Okay. Well... Well, bye.
- Bye.

She broke up with Greg
She broke up with Greg

She broke up with Greg

- Alan?
- Yeah?

Peephole.

- Hey.
- Where have you been?

Car wash. They found something
real interesting in the back seat.

Oh, yeah, what?

Okay, now you're just showing off.

No, Alan, I'm not.

Although I have to admit,
that is a sexy little item.

- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

I'd like to meet the lady who fills this.

Actually, you know her.

- Oh, really? Lisa?
- No.

- Jennifer?
- Who's Jennifer?

Oh, right. No.

Well, then who?

I can tell you, but once I do,
I can't untell you.

- What are you talking about?
- Who borrowed my car last weekend?

Holy mother of God.

No. No. Unholy mother of us.

Mom in a car?

Mom in my car.

If I'd known this was gonna happen,
I'd have gotten the vinyl seats.

Wait. You're not just gonna leave it
in the middle of the floor, are you?

Really creeps you out, doesn't it?

- No.
- Then pick it up.

Hello? Oh, oh, hi, Jake. What's up?

Slow down there.

Yeah. No, I know your mom
broke up with Greg.

Yes. I understand
that you're very upset, but...

Well, no, no.

I can't come over there and pick you up
just because you're mad at your mother.

Well... I'm sorry, that's just the way it is.

Now, why don't you let me
speak to her.

Yeah, Judith, hi.
Look, I am trying to back you up here.

No, I told him he had to work it out
with you.

No, no... Really?

You think it would be better
if he came over here to cool off?

Okay, but...

Well, bring him over, then.

Well... No, I'll see you in a bit.

- Jake's coming over?
- Yeah, yeah.

Apparently he's furious with his mother
about this Greg thing.

Well, that's understandable. He was just
getting to know this amazing guy...

...who had a boat and a pool
and a Hummer.

A guy who could teach him
all sorts of cool stuff.

And then his mother just rips
this wonderful man out of his life.

Too soon?

Hello. Everybody decent?

Oh, hi, Mom. What a surprise.

Well, I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by...

...and see how my sons
are getting along.

- Well, we're doing fine.
- Yep, just fine.

- Good. Jake?
- He's... He's fine.

Just dandy.

Oh, the hell with it.

I left a $300 bra in the back seat
of your Mercedes, and I want it back.

Oh, my. How in heaven's name
did that happen, Mother?

- Well, if you must know...
- I don't need to know.

Oh, Alan, grow up.

I sold a 12-million-dollar house
and I wanted to celebrate.

With the Saudi prince?

Don't be ridiculous. He's got nine wives
and they're all like 11 years old.

No, I was with the seller's realtor.

Splitting that juicy commission
made us both so hot...

...we barely made it
off the front lawn.

Now, go get Mommy's bra.

Oh, darling, that is just sick.

Seek help.

Hey.

- Hey, what's going on?
- My mom broke up with Greg.

I heard.

I'm gonna live here with you and Dad
from now on.

Wanna bet?

- Why not?
- Two reasons:

Your mother loves you,
and life is cruel.

Wait, that may just be one reason.

Well, maybe my dad can talk my mom
into getting back together with Greg.

Enjoy fifth grade, kid. You're obviously
gonna be there for a while.

What am I supposed to do, Alan?

I know how much he liked Greg...

...but that can't be the reason
for me to keep seeing him.

I understand. You're not wrong here.

I'm not? Because I certainly feel wrong.

I failed as a wife.
I'm failing as a mother.

I even blew it as a lesbian.

That might have been the problem.

You're not a failure. We're both at fault
for the marriage not working.

You're a great mother. And I'm sure you
would have made a heck of a lesbian...

...if you just hung in there
a little longer.

I'm gonna take Jake out
so you guys can talk.

- Thank you.
- Thanks, Charlie.

- Where we going?
- I gotta trade in my car.

Why are you trading this car in?
Didn't you just get it?

Yeah, but there's a banging noise
that's driving me crazy.

I don't hear anything.

You're not in my head.

Hey, as long as you're getting rid of it,
mind if I take it for a little spin?

Get real.

I promise I'll go really slow.

Forget it. It's not gonna happen.

Is that a footprint up there?

I never should have brought Jake
into the relationship. It was too soon.

Don't be too hard on yourself.

So Greg didn't turn out to be the great
guy you thought he was gonna be.

Oh, he was a great guy.
My God, Alan, he took my breath away.

Our first night together he picked me up
and carried me to bed in his arms.

Well, the point is you brought Jake
into the relationship too soon.

Greg said I was too demanding.
I am, aren't I?

- I am a demanding, angry shrew.
- Hey, hey.

Don't say that. That...
That is not who you are.

That's just who you've become.

But, you know, underneath it all...

...I can still see the frightened,
neurotic girl...

...with the minor eating disorder
that I fell in love with.

Oh, Alan.

I don't get it.
This is exactly like your other car.

No, it's not. Listen. No banging.

Well, I think you should have gotten
a cool car like Greg.

Hey, do yourself a favor
and stop worshiping this dude.

There's a guy in your life
who's worth looking up to...

...and modeling yourself after.

- Dad?
- Okay, two guys.

Well, I still don't understand
why my mom had to break up with Greg.

It could have been worse. She could
have married him and then broken up.

When I was your age,
I was already on my third stepfather.

And I kind of liked the second one.

Well, how did you feel?

How do you think I felt?
I was pissed off.

- Yeah, well, so am I.
- And I'm not saying you shouldn't be...

...but you can't blame your mother.
She's gotta do what's right for her.

- You understand?
- I guess.

Good.

The next time you see her,
give her a big hug...

...and let her know that there's still
one guy who's willing to live with her.

Okay.

Wait, you blame your mom
for everything.

That's different. My mom's Satan.

Come on, let's go boat shopping.

If I'm old enough to drive...

...I'm old enough to know
what's going on with you and Mom.

You're not old enough to drive.

I don't believe that you were carrying
her because she twisted her ankle.

Believe what you want.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Tell him, Charlie.

Your parents were about to have sex
when we walked in.

Yeah, right.

.......... ********** ..........

- Have any homework this weekend?
- A little.

Why don't you
get started on it tonight.

But it's only Friday.

I know, but if you do it tonight,
you won't worry.

I'm not worried.

Hey. What are you guys up to tonight?

- Jake's gonna do his homework.
- Why?

It's only Friday.

Let me tell you something
about Charlie.

He was a lousy student. He always
put off doing his homework...

...and his grades reflected it.
- Seems like he's doing okay now.

- Go get your books.
- I left my books at Mom's.

- Fine. I'll have her bring them over.
- Okay. They're in my bag.

Go get them.

Okay. Well, don't wait up.

- Pretty confident, huh?
- Yeah.

Thus, the "don't wait up."

Didn't you meet this girl
a couple of days ago?

Yup. So tonight's the night.
You know, the three-day rule.

That's the three-date rule.

Three dates? That's crazy talk.

All right. If you bring her
back here, please be discreet.

Don't worry.
First night's always at her place.

- Is that another rule?
- No. It's just a common courtesy.

A woman's more relaxed and
comfortable in her own surroundings.

Plus, the minute she falls asleep,
I can hit the bricks.

That's lovely. It's a shame
you don't work for Hallmark.

Yeah, I'll bet those guys
get laid like crazy.

- Goodnight, buddy.
- Night.

What happened
to my chicken nuggets?

What are you talking about?
You ate them.

Now, stop procrastinating
and do your homework.

What does procrastinating mean?

It means putting off stuff
that you have to do.

- Can you use it in a sentence?
- I just did.

Oh, yeah.

Did I tell you a bug
flew in my ear today?

Charlie?

- You asleep?
- What? No.

No. You?

Listen, I have to
get up early tomorrow, so...

- You want me to leave?
- Do you mind?

No, I'm cool either way:
Stay or go.

Okay.

So I'm going?

Thanks, you're a doll.

You know, I actually prefer
waking up in my own bed.

Personal little quirk.

- You don't mind, right?
- Not at all.

Good.

So this worked out well
for all concerned, huh?

It was fantastic.
We'll have to do it again.

Absolutely.

- But not tonight?
- No.

- Okay. Well, I'll call you.
- It's probably easier if I call you.

Sure. Either way.

- I call you, you call me.
- I'll call you.

Good.

- So I guess I'll just let myself out.
- Okay.

Sherri, you asleep?

Finally.

- How was school this week?
- Okay.

- Any homework for the weekend?
- Nope.

- Really?
- Okay, yes.

Do we have to go through this
every Friday?

I'd rather we didn't.

Curly fries.

When I was your age,
we didn't even have curly fries.

We had to make do
with straight or crinkle cut.

- What?
- I'm just trying to distract you...

...while I steal your fries.
- Hey.

Jake, don't be selfish.
Let him have one.

So no date tonight?

I thought
I'd just hang with you guys.

- What about that girl you're seeing?
- Sherri? I'm playing that slow.

Really? Do you mean
at a leisurely pace...

...or as if you were
developmentally challenged?

Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me.

Alan, most beautiful women
are used to guys...

...chasing after them. They expect it.

Squeeze a little more ketchup on it,
would you, buddy?

However, if you hang back
and stay cool...

...the women come to you.

Well, not to you specifically,
but you get the theory.

Yeah, I'm not stupid.
Just physically repellent...

...and inherently unlovable.

Don't get snippy with me.
I'm trying to teach you something.

Hey, I agreed to one.

If you're finished with dinner,
get started on homework.

I'm still hungry. He ate all my fries.

You can have ice cream
when you've done your homework.

Isn't that procrastinating?

Go.

Man, that kid guards his plate
like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he?

Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri.

How's it going?

Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't.
I've already got plans.

How about tomorrow night?
Oh, you've got plans.

Okay. Well, Sunday?

Monday?

What about Tuesday?
You know what?

I'm looking at the wrong month
in my date book. Tonight works.

How about I pick you up at 8?

Okay, I'll meet you at 7.

How about Antonio's?

The Oak Room it is.

See you soon.

- What just happened?
- You were playing it slow.

- Everything okay?
- No, perfect, Stephan. Thanks.

Always good to see you.

I liked it too.

So you must be a regular here.

Yeah. Food's good
and I bring a lot of clients.

Speaking of which,
it's getting kind of late.

- I've got an early meeting tomorrow.
- I'll get the check.

I already took care of it.

- When?
- You were in the little boys' room.

- That's not right.
- It's fine. I asked you out. No big deal.

No, you shouldn't call it
"the little boys' room."

- Sorry.
- You're forgiven.

So we can just go.

If it's okay,
I wanna go back to my place.

Oh, great. I'll follow you.

I don't think so, Charlie.
I'm kind of tired.

Okay. Well, how about this?

I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs,
tuck you into bed...

...kiss you good night, and just
as you're drifting off to sleep...

...I will lick your body
from head to toe.

Lovely as that sounds,
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

Okay. Yeah, I guess
it is getting kind of late.

- It's almost 9.
- Thanks for understanding.

- Sure. Hey, we're okay, right?
- Yeah.

- Did I say something to upset you?
- No.

- Are you mad at me?
- No.

- Promise?
- Yes.

Do I sound like a big old girl?

Why didn't you do this part?

That's extra credit.
You don't have to do it.

- Why don't you do it anyway?
- Because I don't have to.

It shows that you're willing
to make an extra effort.

But I'm not.

- Do it anyway.
- Why?

If you spent as much time
doing the work...

...as you do arguing about it,
we'd be done.

I am done. This is extra.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You're home early.

Alan, if you got something to say...

...why don't you just
come out and say it?

You're home early?

Yeah, that's smart. Keep pushing me.

- Did you see that?
- Yeah, he took my ice cream.

Hey, neighbor.

Hi, Rose.

- Didn't you have dessert with Sherri?
- How did you know I was with Sherri?

Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me,
do you?

- So do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

She probably just had
to get up early, like she said.

Probably.

Unless her real date
didn't start until later...

...and she just didn't wanna eat alone.

What?

Oh, come on, Charlie.
Double-booking.

You practically invented it.

No, she wouldn't do that to me.
Why would she do that to me?

Did she do that to me?
She did that to me, didn't she?

- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

I was just taking
a little selfish delight in your pain.

The Germans call it "schadenfreude"...

...but here in the U.S.A.,
we just go:

- Thanks.
- Oh, Charlie...

...you don't need a girl like that.
You could do so much better.

You're right. I can.

She doesn't call
when she says she will.

She won't let me sleep over.
She's obviously seeing other guys.

So why can't I get her
out of my head?

Okay, that's not where I was going,
but let's review:

She's gorgeous,
but she's also self-centered...

...she's promiscuous,
she's commitment-phobic...

- Oh, my God.
- What?

I'm dating myself.

No wonder the sex is so good.

Trust me. You'll feel better
having this done.

- We'll have the weekend to have fun.
- What if we don't have fun?

Then all this studying
will be for nothing.

That's just a risk we'll have to take.

Now, what year did Magellan
circumnavigate the globe?

- It's not gonna be on the test.
- Maybe not.

It wouldn't hurt
for you to know it.

Why would I wanna know
something I don't have to?

Because maybe you'll need
to know it in the future.

Well, then, that's when I'll learn it.

Why can't you just learn it now?

There's only
so much space in my brain...

...that if you put Magellan in there,
I might forget my locker combination.

- Charlie, help me out here.
- What?

Jake doesn't think he needs
to know anything about Magellan.

What's Magellan?

Okay, I'm out of here.
Won't be late.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Bad news from the clinic?

No. I'm just taking
Sherri out for a nice dinner...

...after which I plan to
gently but firmly...

...extricate myself
from the relationship.

So she got bad news from the clinic?

There's no bad news.
There's no clinic.

- I'm just ending it.
- Why?

Because she's a self-centered,
manipulative narcissist.

So are you.

Hello.

He said "narcissist."

It's not a dirty word.

What does it mean?

If you wanna know,
look it up in the dictionary.

Okay.

He's not coming back.

- Thank you, Steven.
- It's "Stephan."

Sure, it is.

Listen, Sherri, we need to talk.

- You're a terrific woman, but...
- You look so hot tonight.

Really?

- That was incredible.
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

It's funny how things work out.

An hour ago I wasn't
feeling too good about us.

I gotta get up
early again tomorrow.

So if you don't mind...

There you go, Elvis.
Peanut butter and bananas.

- My mom cuts it diagonally.
- Yeah?

Well, that's the way
I learned to cut it in prison.

Thank you?

Alan, got a riddle for you:

What's short, picky and only
supposed to be here on weekends?

I'll give you a hint: It's your kid.

I know. I know.
His mother decided...

...she had to go to Palm Springs
to rejuvenate herself.

Detox?

No, a health spa.
Six hundred dollars a day...

...for meditation and colonics.

How in the hell do you meditate...

...when someone's
squirting water up your business?

I don't think they
happen simultaneously, Berta.

That's good, because
it could be very distracting.

I can't even pee
when the cat's watching me.

Nobody answer the phone!

Please, let it be her.
Please, please, please.

No, wait.
Berta, you answer it.

No, no, no! Let it ring.

No, answer it.

- Harper residence.
- I'm not here.

- Yeah, he's here.
- Okay, I'm here.

Jake, it's your mother!

So how's it going down there?
You struck oil yet?

Charlie, what is going on with you?

- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

You're spending half your time
drinking and moping.

The other half sleeping
and throwing up.

You haven't been
out of the house all week.

You want me
to go out like this in public?

If you feel so strongly about this girl,
why don't you just call her?

Yeah, sure, I could call her.

I could also FedEx her my testicles
in a little silk bag.

All the more reason to call first
and give her a heads-up.

Alan, don't you understand?
This isn't about dating anymore.

It's not even about sex.
It's about self-respect and pride.

Yeah, well, I think
that ship has sailed, Charlie.

See, the problem is
she doesn't need me.

So I need to figure out
a way to show her...

...that I don't need her just as much
as she doesn't need me.

But without seeming needy.

You see my dilemma?

Actually, I think I do.

You feel like I felt
when Judith kicked me out.

All right, if you're gonna mock me,
this conversation's over.

- Who took my sandwich?
- Go do your homework.

Unbelievable.

- I'm glad you were free tonight.
- I'm glad I was home when you called.

I would've called sooner,
but it's been a crazy week.

It's okay. I understand.

- Oh, Charlie, I want you.
- Are you sure?

- Oh, yeah.
- How much?

- Can't you tell?
- I wanna hear it.

I need you. I ache for you.

Okay, then.

- What are you doing?
- I've gotta get home.

I got an early meeting.

- What?
- Beat you to it this time, didn't I?

What are you talk...? What kind
of game are you playing here?

The same game you're playing,
only tonight, I win.

Really? What is it that you're winning?

Charlie, I'm lying here hungry for
your body and you're walking away.

So, what exactly is it
that you're winning?

You know.

- Get out.
- It's too late.

You can't kick me out.
I already said I'm leaving.

Hey.

- So how'd it go?
- Great.

I took control.
I regained my self-respect.

I walked out of there
with my head held high.

Good for you. Good for you.
So you're done beating yourself up?

Not quite.

Jake, wait till we get inside.

I'm hungry.
Uncle Charlie's in there.

I see your point.

At the risk of asking
a foolish question...

...you got any homework
this weekend?

- Nope. Did it at school.
- Really?

- Yup. Did it during detention.
- Jake, why did you have detention?

Because I didn't
do my homework yesterday.

So you did yesterday's homework
and today's homework?

Yup. The extra-credit section
and everything.

- Oh, great. I'll look it over.
- Okay, I didn't do it.

- Jake, why do you keep lying?
- Because I thought you trusted me.

The detention part was true.

Hi, Charlie.

Hey, Rose. What's going on?

I just stopped by to say I'm sorry
things didn't work out...

...with you and Sherri.
- Yeah. Thanks.

And I'm sorry for my
schadenfreude the other day.

I've been riddled with
"glaukenschtuken" ever since.

- Glauken...?
- Schtuken.

It means: " Feeling guilty
for having felt schadenfreude."

- They've got a word for that?
- Not yet.

But I'm hoping
"glaukenschtuken" catches on.

I'll do my part.

You know, something good
did come out of all this:

Watching you obsess over Sherri...

...really helped me understand
my obsession for you.

I mean, you never return my calls.
You always see other women.

You never knowingly
let me sleep over.

And yet, I've never been able
to get you out of my head.

- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

But now that I understand it,
I feel somehow free of it.

Well, that's great, Rose. It sounds
like a real healthy breakthrough.

Yeah. And the best part is now
that the fog of obsession has lifted...

...I can stop idealizing you,
and see you for who you really are.

And who would that be?

An emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed human being.

Who will one day bless me...

...with emotionally scarred
and deeply flawed children.

Rose.

Just hold me.

I like the names Mike and Trudy.

.......... ********** ..........

- So, dear...
- What?

Do you see anything you like?

I don't know. What's venison?

- Deer.
- What?

- Deer.
- What?

Deer. D-E-E-R.

What? W-H-A-T.

What's wrong with him?

Jake, it's... It's the deer
in the forest, like... Like Bambi.

Oh, cool, let's eat Bambi.

Coming soon to pay-per-view.

Mom, wha...? What are you doing?

- Nothing.
- Oh, that's stealing.

Hardly. I'm paying $ 12 for a martini.

They're lucky I don't take a chair.

- You're paying?
- Figure of speech, Charles.

Can I take this?

- No.
- Oh, come on.

My precious.

Put it down. We do not take things
that don't belong to us.

Listen who's taking the moral
high ground, Mr. Five-Finger Discount.

- What does that mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

- How do you want your venison?
- Does it come with antlers?

Alan, there's no reason
your son can't learn from your mistakes.

I didn't make a mistake, Mom.

Unbelievable.
Twenty-five years later...

...and he still denies shoplifting.

Oh, I get it. Five-finger discount.
Cool.

I did not shoplift, Jake.
It was a misunderstanding.

Alan, please.

Walking around a toy store
with your brother...

...and the Silly Putty just jumped
in your pocket?

Yes.

Not much of a lie, Dad.

Okay, everybody ready to order?

Is that why you won't
let me have Silly Putty?

It's a stupid, pointless toy.

But why'd you steal it?

I didn't. The security guard must have
planted it on me to make a bust.

Oh, Alan.

Who in their right mind would plant
Silly Putty on a 9-year-old boy?

Who, indeed?

- Hey, Jake, you ever eaten snails?
- Yeah, sure.

I mean, in a restaurant.

Oh, no.

- You okay?
- No. That deer didn't have antlers...

...when I ate it,
but it's sure coming out that way.

Well, you'll feel better tomorrow.

We should sue that restaurant.

Well, I'll get right on it. Come on.

- Dad?
- Yeah.

Did you ever steal a car?

I never stole anything.

It's okay. You could tell me.

I already know you got a rap sheet.

For the last time,
I did not take that Silly Putty.

But the experience
did teach me a very important lesson.

And you know what that was?

If you get caught, stick to your story,
no matter how lame it is?

- No, the lesson was...
- Hang on, Dad.

Okay, go ahead.

The lesson was...

Oh, God, Jake. That's...
That's awful.

Yeah, I wish I could have saved
that one for school.

- You too?
- Yeah.

Apparently Mom wasn't
the only parasite at dinner tonight.

Hey...

...how much do you remember
about the whole Silly Putty incident?

Oh, gee, not too much.

I recall you crying when they dragged
you into the store manager's office.

Then I went and got a corn dog
and an Orange Julius.

Boy, those were good.

- Remember those?
- No, I mean...

...did you see me take
the Silly Putty?

Oh, no, no,
I was nowhere near the Silly Putty.

I think I was in the doll section,
taking a peek under Barbie's dress.

What a gyp that was.

If Jake had been caught
shoplifting and told me the story I told...

...there's no way I'd believe him.

Well, let's just hope
he doesn't get caught.

- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Okay.

I always knew
it wasn't the security guard.

Really?

There's only one rational explanation
for how the Silly Putty got in my pants.

And what would that be?

That I actually stole it,
but my mind couldn't deal with it.

So somehow, I blocked it out.

The human brain, huh?
You gotta love it.

That happens, right?
You do something horrible...

...and wake up with no recollection?
- Oh, yeah.

And yet there she is,
lying right next to you.

You know, that day changed my life.

I mean, ever since, I've had to be
on guard against Bad Alan.

I'm sorry, "Bad Alan"?

Yeah, it's... It's what I call
my potential for evildoing.

- Oh, God.
- It's why I've always worked so hard...

...to be a good son, a good student,
a good person.

And you've succeeded.
You are good, good, good.

Well, sure, I turned out great,
but at what cost?

I mean, do you have any clue
how tightly wrapped I've had to be...

...to keep Bad Alan in check?

I get glimpses.

Well, I suppose
I should count my blessings...

...that I was stopped.
Who knows what kind of monster...

...I would've become if I hadn't
been caught with the putty.

But what if the security guard
did plant it on you?

That would mean there's no Bad Alan.

That's true.

But I can't afford
to take that chance.

None of us can.

He's fine.

Hey, Charlie.

Hey, Rose.

Looks like somebody needs
a shoulder to cry on.

No, thank you.

Wanna just make out then?

- Rose...
- You're right. That was out of line.

I deserve a spanking.

Okay, what's up?

- Can I trust you with something?
- You trust me...

...with your bank account number.

I never gave you
my bank account number.

Right, right. Go on.

Have you ever done anything
so wrong, so horrible...?

Oh, yeah.

- Let me finish.
- I'm sorry.

Something that seemed
harmless at the time...

...yet somehow managed
to mess up someone's entire life?

Good question.

I think it's too early to say. Go on.

Well, I have.

Twenty-five years ago,
I put Silly Putty in my brother's pants.

Well, if you left it in the egg,
it should still be good.

My point is,
everybody thought he stole it...

...and I never told him the truth.

Now you're wracked with guilt...

...and not sure whether a confession
will make things better or worse.

Yes, exactly.

That's a sexy feeling, isn't it?

Come on, Rose.

You want my advice, Charlie?

God help me, yes.

Take your secret to the grave...

...but leave a manuscript explaining
every questionable act...

...you've committed
in a safety-deposit box...

...with instructions for it to be opened
at your death...

...and read in front of all your friends,
relatives and former lovers.

I like it.

Good.

Now we can relax
and enjoy the evening.

Sing it with me, Charlie.

Three, four, five, six, seven.

- Are you decent?
- Yeah.

Three, four, five, six, seven.

What's up?

- Nothing. Just came in to say good night.
- Three, four, five, six, seven.

Why?

Three, four, five, six, seven.

Nothing. You just seemed stressed out
before, and I was concerned.

Oh, thanks. You're a...
You're a good brother.

Three, four, five, six, seven.

You do that every night?

Are you kidding? After every meal.

Three, four, five, six, seven.

You are tightly wrapped, aren't you?

The price of healthy gums
is eternal vigilance.

Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

- Do what?
- I have to tell you something.

- Okay.
- Come on out in the bedroom.

All right.

- What you doing?
- You'll understand in a minute.

- I thought you had to tell me something.
- I do.

There is no Bad Alan.

I stole the Silly Putty...

...and put it in your pocket
when you weren't looking.

- Three, four, five, six, seven.
- Damn you to hell!

Come out here and die like a man!

What do you know,
there is a Bad Alan.

Hey, Dad, when you got arrested
for shoplifting, did they take you to jail?

I did not get arrested,
and there was no jail.

So I guess you never had to shank a guy
to get your props in the yard.

You cracked the parental code
on the cable box again.

It's 1-2-3-4.
A monkey could crack that.

- Good morning.
- Morning.

Why are you walking like that?

I spent the night in the bathroom.

You too, huh?

Tell Jake what you told me
last night.

Oh, okay. Sure.

Jake, your father didn't steal
the Silly Putty.

- I did.
- Really?

Yeah, I stuck it in his pocket,
so if anything happened...

...he'd be the one to get in trouble.

What do you think now, Jake?

I think Uncle Charlie's a genius.

What? No, no. No genius. No, no.

I mean, it's the perfect crime.
How did you think of that?

I don't know.

I saw the putty. Your dad was wearing
those dorky chinos with the big pockets.

- And a light just went off in my head...
- Charlie.

A bad light. A bad, evil light.
Because stealing is wrong...

...and letting somebody else
take the blame for it is worse.

Yeah, so Dad was like a decoy.

Well, technically, the term is "mule."

- Mule? Why?
- Because he carries stuff.

- Oh, of course...
- Okay, okay.

The important thing is,
your father never stole in his life.

And your Uncle Charlie
is a thief and a coward.

Yeah, but you're a mule.

Are you happy?
Go get dressed and washed.

- Can we go to the mall?
- Why do you wa...? No.

I need to get a different mule.

Okay, can we please get past this?

No. No, we can't.

I feel betrayed and hurt
in ways that I can't even express.

And you think we can
just dance past that?

I was hoping.

Well, I am sorry,
but it is not that easy.

I mean, thanks to you, my... My life
has been twisted beyond recognition.

I mean, look at me, Charlie.

I'm a... I'm a broke, hopelessly neurotic,
middle-aged man...

...who doesn't know who he is
or where he belongs.

I have nothing, Charlie.

- No... No wife, no home, nothing.
- Okay.

So should I check back with you
after lunch?

What do you want me to do?

I said I was sorry.
L... I confessed to Jake.

And I doubt I got more than six,
seven hours sleep last night.

Nothing you can do.
The damage has been done.

- It can't be undone.
- Come on, I'm your brother.

- You're gonna forgive. You always do.
- No, no, this is different.

- This is the worst thing you've ever done.
- No, it's not.

What do you mean?

Just making conversation.

- Hey, Mom.
- Charlie, what are you doing here?

- In the neighborhood. Thought I'd visit.
- Why?

- I don't know. I'm your son.
- And...?

- And I was hoping we could talk.
- About?

May I please just come in?

Are you fleeing from the law?

- I'm not fleeing from anyone, Mom.
- Well, keep it in mind.

No one would ever think
to look for you at your mother's house.

- I get your point. I don't visit enough.
- You don't visit at all.

And I'm riddled with guilt.

Oh, you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

So, what's up?

You know how the other night
at dinner...

...we were talking about
the Silly Putty deal?

Did that venison disagree with you?

Yeah, that's not
what I came to talk about.

I've got a good mind
to sue that restaurant.

- Yeah, anyway, about the Silly Putty...
- What about it?

Alan didn't steal it. I did.

I put it in his pocket.

You framed your baby brother?

How could you?

I know, I know.
It was a rotten thing to do.

Rotten? It's unspeakable.

Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

- You?
- First the embarrassment...

...of people thinking
that I'd spawned a petty thief.

Then all the trouble I went to
trying to figure out clever ways...

...to hide my jewelry
from his sticky little fingers.

- That's really not what l...
- Not to mention the hundreds of hours...

...spent driving him to therapy
with that creepy Dr. Demerest...

...while I could have been...
I don't know, doing something fun.

Okay, yeah,
it was a real imposition on you...

...and as it turns out, it had
kind of a negative impact on Alan too.

Alan? Oh, yes, of course.

You know, there was no insurance
for kleptomania therapy in those days.

It was all out of pocket.

Yeah, but about Alan...

...I was hoping you might have insight
as to how I could get him to forgive me.

Why ask me?

You know,
I'm starting to wonder that myself.

I guess it's because he still loves you...

...despite all the lousy stuff
you did to him.

I beg your pardon?
I was a wonderful mother.

And if Alan thinks otherwise...

...it's only because that walleyed
Dr. Demerest put ideas into his head.

Well, that was money well spent.

Okay, then.

I didn't need a reason to drink tonight,
but it's nice to know I've got one.

Hey, Charlie, wait.

- What?
- Have you forgotten why you came here?

You want forgiveness, right?

- Yes.
- Well...

...I forgive you.

But next time, call first.

Would you pass the salt?

Could you get me the salt?

- Dad, salt.
- Sure.

- Here.
- Thanks.

Oh, would you give me
the ketchup, please?

Here. Here's the ketchup.

Thank you.

- Dad?
- Yeah.

If Uncle Charlie
let you kick him in the nuts...

...would that make you guys even?

No.

Boy, he's really mad at you.

Relax, Jake. We're just having
a little communication problem.

That's what Dad said
right before Mom threw him out.

Nobody threw me out.

Your mother and I mutually decided
that we weren't compatible.

You don't seem compatible
with Uncle Charlie right now.

- Well, it's not my fault.
- Was it your fault with Mom?

No.

You know, Dad, maybe you're
the one who's not compatible.

If you're done with dinner,
do your homework.

Fine, kill the messenger.

- Oh, come on, Alan. Talk to me.
- No.

Look, I wanna make this right,
but you gotta help me.

Please, tell me what I can do.
I'm begging for your forgiveness.

I am sorry,
but you did something...

...which affected my life
in a deeply destructive way and...

l... I don't think I have it in me
to forgive you.

- Hello? Anybody home?
- In here, Mom.

Well, how are my boys
doing this evening?

Well, I think Mommy
has the answer. Alan...

...if you find it intolerable
living under the same roof...

...with the brother
who betrayed you...

...then you and Jake
can come and live with me.

We're good.

Hey, Charlie, a couple of days ago...

...you said the Silly Putty wasn't
the worst thing you ever did to me.

It's ancient history. Let it go.

I know, I know.
It's just... I'm curious.

What else have you done to me
that I didn't know about?

- It's not important.
- Yes, it is.

The truth about
the shoplifting incident...

...it's allowed me
to reevaluate who I am...

...and... And feel better about myself.

- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

I feel a lot better since I confessed.

Good, good.
So let's keep going with this.

Okay, but you gotta promise that
no matter what I tell you, all is forgiven.

Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

You're probably gonna laugh.

- I'm sure I will. Tell me.
- Well...

...remember how you were
a bed wetter till you were 8?

Yeah.

You actually stopped at 6.

Wha...? What...? What did you do?
Did you sneak into my room and...?

And...? And pour warm water on me
while I was asleep?

Yeah, okay, let's say it was water,
and let's say I poured it.

Well, I feel better. How about you?

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey, Dad.

Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

Apparently not.

Do you see how rude he is to me?

It's terrible. I'll talk to him.

- I wish you would because... Wait, Alan!
- Oh, oh, sorry.

Alan, have you been badmouthing me?

- Badmouthing you? To whom?
- To Jake.

Oh, to Jake. No.

- Why?
- His attitude towards me is disrespectful.

I have to wonder
where he's getting it from.

I assure you, I make it a point
to speak well of you in front of our son.

What about your brother?

Oh, with Charlie,
I'm completely honest.

That is not what I meant.

I know.

Hey, Judith.

Have you said derogatory things
about me to Jake?

No, why? Did you want me to?

I don't understand his behavior.

Ignoring me, avoiding me,
acting like I'm the enemy.

But you get why I'm doing it, right?

I got it!

I don't know what to say.
He's not getting it from us.

- Absolutely not.
- It's your mother!

- You talk to her.
- No, I talked last time.

- Choose you for it.
- Odds.

One, two, three, shoot.

- Odds. You talk to her.
- No.

- Hey, but you said you were gonna...
- I lied.

Leave a message at the beep. Beep!

I wish there were a better way
to deal with Mom.

There is, but we're both
too pretty for jail.

- What?
- What?

Mom's here.

Charlie, did you hear me?

Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial.

Come on.

We talked about this.
We need to set an example.

Fine, tell Mom I love her and...
I don't wanna give her my cold.

That is not going to help.

Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake.

No. Here is the plan.

We'll stop acting
like we hate being with her...

...stop taking shots at her, and start
acting like we love and respect her.

- All at once?
- Come on.

Your Uncle Charlie thinks
I don't see him...

...but Grandmommy sees everything.

Mom, we didn't expect
to see you today.

I have to come unannounced
because when I call first...

...there's no one home
when I get here.

I imagine that's only because
my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me.

She's ruining the plan.

Well, the important thing is we're
all here, and we're happy to see you.

- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, happy isn't the word.

- So, what's new, Mom?
- Well, if you really care...

- We do, we do.
- We do.

Next Sunday,
I am receiving my gold blazer...

...from the
Westside Realtor's Association.

- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

Me too, Mom.

It's the highest honor
the real-estate community can bestow.

- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

Me too, Mom.

So I wanted to talk to you
about the presentation ceremony.

We'll be there.
Tell us where and when.

Well, next Sunday, 5:00.
And I was hoping we could have it here.

- Here?
- Why here?

- I mean, we love and respect you...
- But why here?

This isn't really
a good house for parties.

- Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean.
- Yeah.

Come on. I can't very well
throw a party for myself.

This way everyone will get to see
how much my sons love and respect me.

Anyway, here is the guest list,
and also a suggested menu.

Nothing fancy. Cocktails, buffet.

Any questions?

- No.
- Good.

Okay.

Big kiss. Love you all.

- Love you too, Mom.
- Bye, Grandma.

Relatives, huh?

Can't live with them,
can't turn them in for the reward.

Excuse me, Berta, but we happen
to love our mother very much.

- Right, Charlie?
- Right.

Jake, look.
There's a pelican on the deck.

Oh, cool.

Are you happy?

Now we have to throw a party
for your crazy-ass mother.

- She's your mother too.
- How do you know?

- I could've been adopted.
- You wish.

I do. Now, what about
this stupid party?

Here. Maybe this'll help.

"Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait"?

Turn it over.

"Daisy's Classy Catering."

She's my sister. Her husband left.
I'm trying to get her back on her feet.

She runs a catering business
and a bait shop?

Not at the same time.

There's no pelican.

Hey, you Charlie?

Maybe.

- Who's asking?
- I'm Daisy, the caterer.

Your Berta's sister?

Same mom. Dad's a little iffy.

Berta said if I wanted a shot
of your bourbon, I had to ask you.

- Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

I don't usually drink before noon,
but I'm going through a rough patch.

Well, that's why they make bourbon.

My husband left me for another woman.
You know how I found out?

- To tell you the truth...
- Relax. It's rhetorical.

They waved to me as they drove
my house out of the trailer park.

- That's sad.
- Yeah.

I had that doublewide 11 years.

Larry was with me for four.

Six months of those were house arrest,
so you can't give him credit for that.

You know,
I haven't gotten up to pee yet.

Let me tell you something.

Larry was nothing when I met him.

He was working at some kosher
slaughterhouse out in Fontana...

...before they fired him
for being mean to the cattle.

What?

The Jewish laws dictate that
the animals have to be treated kindly...

...before they get whacked.

Larry would taunt them.

"Hey, hamburger,
guess what's gonna happen to you."

Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry,
unemployed ass.

I gave him hair plugs,
contact lenses, teeth.

The bastard dumped me for this tiny,
little Korean manicurist...

...who huffs nail-polish remover
between appointments.

Well, you give a guy hair and teeth,
he's bound to hook up with trash.

No, she was pretty hot.

She had a spray-on tan,
Botox up the yin-yang.

Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60.

- Daisy!
- In here!

What the hell are you doing?

Relax. It's not what you think.
We're just having a drink.

Good idea.

You listen to me.
Just because I got us this job...

...doesn't mean
I'm cooking by myself.

I'm coming down there.

And don't act like you're doing me
some big favor.

Oh, excuse me for trying to help
my broke, homeless, baby sister.

I'm not homeless. I have a home.
I just don't know where it's parked.

I wouldn't be broke if you'd have
paid me my share of Mama's estate.

What estate? It was a shoebox...

...full of corn pads,
used lottery tickets and insulin.

It's the first I'm hearing
about the insulin.

Excuse me, but shouldn't we be,
you know...

...cooking something
for my mother's party?

Hang on, Charlie.

You know, I am sick of you insinuating
that I stole all that crap Mama left me.

She didn't leave it to you. You were just
the first one back after she flatlined.

Oh, and where were you?
At some ashram in Oregon?

I was learning from my guru
how to channel my spirit guide.

Oh, please. You were humping
a defrocked priest in the woods.

How about stuffed mushrooms?
Everybody loves those.

You know, that's your problem
your whole life.

You chase after losers,
take care of them, fix them up...

...and then they hop on
the first manicurist out of town.

You're jealous because
I've had love in my life.

Yeah? You know what you got
in your life now? Squat.

No husband, no one to do your nails,
and blocks where your house used to be.

I swear to God. One more word and
I'm gonna knock you on your keister!

- Okay, okay, there's no reason...
- Squat!

- That's it!
- Whoa, whoa, no!

No, whoa! Stop! Berta!

Berta!

Give me the rolling pin.

Is there a special place
you'd like me to put it?

I don't know what else
you want from me. I took you in.

Gunther's in the garage,
so you can have the couch.

You spoil that dog.
Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight.

Good idea. Maybe you'll meet
your next husband on the walk there.

- Can I have one of these?
- No.

I am just trying to be a good sister.

No, you're trying
to make me feel like crap.

It's what you always do.

- So I can eat this?
- No.

- Let him have one.
- You don't know this kid.

He never stops at one.
He eats like a refugee.

- Eat it.
- Drop it.

Hey, how's it going?

Not good.

Nice move, Tinkerbell.

- Shut your hole and help me pick this up.
- You pick it up.

I'm going outside to meditate.

- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

You wanted that clown
to be nice to his mother.

But did you think to say to him,
"Clown, be nice to your mother"?

No, we had to throw a big party
for our mother...

...catered by
the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

That's it. I can't work like this.

Well, you have to, Berta.

We've got 50 people coming
in a couple of hours.

- Don't tell me. Tell her.
- Fine.

Watch this.

Hey! I'm meditating here!

Jake, let's go pick up Grandma.

- Charlie, you're in charge.
- The hell I am.

- Why pick her up?
- Grandma likes to drink.

- When grownups drink, they don't drive.
- Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here.

So, good luck. I'll see you tomorrow.

No, wait. Berta, you can't leave.

Don't worry. Your deposit's fully
refundable in fishing tackle or live bait.

I don't want a refund.

I want you to make up with Daisy...

...so when my mother gets here, she'll
have something to eat besides my soul.

Make up with her?
For what? Trying to help her?

Trying to keep her from making
the same stupid mistake again?

Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. Just do it!

No, I'm done with her. I quit.

Berta... Berta, you can't quit being
related to somebody.

Believe me, I've tried.

She is a spoiled, little princess...

...who doesn't know
when somebody's trying to help.

- And you know what else?
- Hold on, hold on.

I'm still trying to wrap
my brain around "little princess."

Ever since Mom spit her out,
she got everything she wanted.

"We don't need to fix Berta's teeth,
Daisy needs singing lessons."

"Why spend money
on a prom dress for Berta...

...when Daisy needs tap shoes?"
- That's rough, but...

"Who cares if Berta needs
her spine straightened?"

"Daisy wants a nose job!"

What if you went ahead and made
a couple dozen of those little egg rolls?

"So what if Berta's got
an extra big toe?"

- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

Why aren't you dressed?
We came to pick you up.

So you can drink.

Oh, yes, well,
I've decided to pass on the party.

What? You can't pass.

We've got people coming,
decorations, caterers.

And that's how you're dressed?

Beats the hell out of a bathrobe.

- Why don't you wanna go to your party?
- Please, it isn't a party.

It's a sham.
None of those people are my friends.

Why would you think that?

Believe it or not, Alan, your mother is
a very sensitive woman...

...and I can feel when people around me
know that I hate them.

Why did you want us
to throw the party?

Oh, why does anyone want a party?

To feel superior
while feigning humility.

Don't touch that, Jake.

Let me tell you something.

The way you treat people
is the way they treat you back.

Miserable bastards.

But putting that aside,
you're getting a gold jacket today...

...and we wanted
to share that with you.

Is that what it takes? I have to win an
award for my sons to notice I'm alive?

Okay, you know what?
Go, don't go. I don't care.

If you wanna sit here
and stew in the venom and bile...

...that is the soup of your being,
then fine. I hope you drown in it.

Don't you ever talk
to your mother this way.

Forget the party.
I'll go back and tell those people...

...that the guest of honor could not
be bothered to show up.

- Come on, Jake.
- Oh, dear Lord.

Alan, wait.

If this silly, little party
means that much to you, I'll go.

Just let me get dressed.

Oh, gee. Thanks, Mom.

God, I hate being guilted
into doing things.

And after all that, the loans,
the bail, the kidney I gave her...

...which even though it wasn't mine,
was still money out of pocket...

...did she appreciate my sacrifices?

I'm guessing no.

She threw them away on chasing
after men with drinking problems...

...men with gambling problems,
men with wooden legs and glass eyes.

You wanna know why?

Spare parts?

Low self-esteem.

I remember
when we were little girls...

...she had this crush
on our cousin Jimmy...

- He wasn't really our cousin. He was...
- Stop, please! Enough.

If you won't talk to her, I will.

Finally. I was running out of stories.

Daisy?

Can I talk to you for a minute?

Daisy is no longer inhabiting
this earthly vessel.

Excuse me?

I am Oxyquatzal,
warrior priestess of the Aztec people.

Okay.

Let me ask you something.

Do you know how to make
those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry?

Listen carefully.
I have a message for Daisy.

- Really?
- She's wandered off the path of destiny.

She must return.

Alrighty, is there a number
where she can reach you?

Tell her to follow her bliss...

...to stop squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

- Got it.
- Do you need to write that down?

No, I got it. Path, bliss, spirit.

- Great Spirit.
- Sorry. "Great Spirit."

- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

- What do you want?
- You're screwing with me, right?

Get out of here.
I'm trying to channel my spirit guide.

OxyContin?

Oxyquatzal. How do
you know about her?

Oh, boy.

Berta!

Was Oxyquatzal here?
What did she say?

She said that the guests
are gonna be here soon...

...so you should make up
with your sister and finish cooking.

No, she didn't.

How do you know?

Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-old
Aztec warrior.

Do you think she really cares
about your dumb-ass party?

Everybody likes a party.

What did she really say, Chachi?

She said that you have strayed from
your path and to follow your bliss...

...which is catering, right?
- No, I never liked catering.

I only got into it because the bait
business was so damn competitive.

What else?

Something about squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

Oh, man, that is heavy.

For an ancient chick,
she is so spot on.

Well, no sense crying over
squandered gifts.

What do you say
we go to the kitchen?

What's the point?
My life is hopeless. My dreams are dead.

Yeah, but what if they weren't?

- What do you mean?
- Oh, I don't know.

What if there was some way
I could help you?

You think you could whip up
some rumaki then?

You don't even know
what my dreams are.

Oh, come on. Work with me, baby.
I don't even know what rumaki is!

Oh, gosh, Alan,
I don't know about this.

- Is my hair all right?
- Mom, your hair looks perfect.

You're impeccably dressed,
you're fashionably late...

...and everybody is waiting for you.

So, now, come on, let's walk in there
and rub their noses in your success.

Well, all right.

- Alan.
- What?

You're blocking me.

Rumaki?

I will never, ever forgive you for this.

One thing. One lousy thing I ask
from my sons, and this is what I get.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

Not only was I roundly ignored
at my own party...

...but I listened
to a disturbed caterer belt out...

...the entire score
of La Cage aux Folles.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

You should be sorry.

We are.

Then say it.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

Hello?

Jake, honey, ready to go home?

Mom, you're here. I love you.

Wonderful. Teach him sarcasm.
Thank you very much.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey, how do I look?
- Incredible.

All men want to be you,
all women want to be with you.

Could you at least look at me
before you answer?

I stand corrected.

All men want to be with you...

Charlie, come on.
I'm really nervous here.

This is my first real date since college.

- What the hell is this?
- Bourbon.

- You drink bourbon while you work out?
- Gin makes me sweat.

Look, don't turn this into a bigger deal
than it needs to be.

- You met a woman, you asked her out...
- Technically, she asked me out.

See, I was in the market, and she
needed advice on picking out corn.

There were no employees around.
There never are.

Even if they are, they're not
knowledgeable about produce.

- Thank God you were there.
- Tell me about it.

I explained that you have to
husk a few ears...

...to check the firmness
of the kernels.

Next thing you know,
she asked me out.

Well, I guess that's why they say no one
gets more action than a greengrocer.

- They say that?
- No.

The point is, it's just dinner.

You'll go, you'll bore her to death,
you'll come home.

Yeah, I know, but I wanna look good
while I'm doing it.

You look fine. Just relax. Be yourself.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

- You think I should bring some condoms?
- Why?

Well, I see the
public service commercials...

Yeah, you're right. See you later.

Feel the burn.

I think it's going well.

My God, Alan. You're like a machine.

I'm a love shark, baby.
If I stop making love, I drown.

Okay, okay, okay.
Wait a sec, wait a sec:

Sharks don't growl.

All right, I'm a love bear.

If I stop making love,
I prevent forest fires.

Jeez.

- Alan.
- Put that out.

- Morning.
- Morning.

I see you've been working out again.

Yeah, well, it's good for my heart.

I figure the liver damage
makes it kind of a push.

Morning, all.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Thirsty.

Alan.

Well, gadzooks,
Zippy's getting his freak on.

Yeah, it seems we're living
in an age of miracles.

I guess if they can put
a man on the moon...

...they can put a woman
on your brother.

- Who's the girl?
- I don't know.

He met her at the supermarket.
Helped her pick out corn.

Corn?

Well, I'm not in any position to judge.
I once did a guy for a tank of gas.

- Hey, Alan? Alan?
- Yeah?

- What you got there?
- Basting brush...

...chocolate sauce, rubber gloves. You
know what we're gonna use them for?

- No.
- Neither do I.

Charlie, I have never had sex
like this before in my life.

In fact, I don't think anything I've had
prior to this can even be called sex.

Because if you call that sex,
we need a new name for this.

My suggestion would be
"hootenanny yum-yum."

I'm happy for you.

Me too. Oh, do we have a step stool?

- Hallway closet.
- Thank you.

- You might wanna pace yourself.
- Yeah, right.

Oh, boy.

- What?
- Oh, boy.

Can I watch TV?

I don't see why not.
You got eyes and a butt.

Where's Alan?

- He's here.
- Well, may I speak with him?

Sure, why not.

Okay, okay. Wait a sec.

- Ta-da!
- Yes!

Not a good time, Charlie.

Well, I thought you might like to know
that your ex-wife and son are here.

She's supposed to bring him on Friday.

It is Friday.

But not until 5.

It is 5.

Okay, cover for me. I'll be right out.

- Alan.
- Yeah?

You might wanna take off
the rubber glove first.

Good thinking.

- He'll be right out.
- Thank you.

So...

...how are you?

What's going on in there?

Alan's moving furniture around,
because he's constantly redecorating.

Sorry, I was taking a nap.

So... So, what's up?

I wanted to remind you that Jake has his
karate tournament tomorrow morning.

- Okay.
- What's that on your face?

- Just a little chocolate sauce.
- Thank you.

Got it, karate tournament,
tomorrow morning.

Alan, what's going on?

What's... What's going on
is I was lying in bed...

...eating a sundae.

- After moving furniture.
- After moving furniture.

And I fell asleep
in some chocolate sauce.

Goodbye, Alan.

- I think she bought it.
- You think?

No.

Why didn't you tell her
you've got a woman?

I don't know. It just seems wrong.

You're divorced.
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

It's not guilt. It's more shame.

- What are you ashamed of?
- Charlie, I spent 12 years with Judith.

We went through a lot together.
You can't just erase all that...

...by lapping chocolate sauce
out of another woman's navel.

Okay, my fault for asking. Now,
what do you wanna do about Jake?

Oh, my God, Jake's here.
I don't want him to know I'm dating.

This is not dating, Alan.
This is rubber gloves and step stools.

All right, all right.

You distract him, and I'll
sneak Nancy out and drive her home.

- Fine.
- Okay.

Wrong. This is just wrong, so wrong.

Hey, Jake, wanna go
shoot some hoops?

In a minute.

He's oblivious. Just go.

In a minute.

No, he's still watching TV.
Hold on, I'll check.

- You hungry?
- What are we having?

- I don't know. Tell me if you're hungry.
- That depends on what we're having.

- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

He's not hungry.

So I thought you were taking her home
and coming right back.

You checked into a hotel?

No, you're right,
driving that way is dangerous.

One pothole
can change your life forever.

When's the last time you ate something?
Quit giggling, you know what I mean.

Okay. Okay, look in the honor bar
for some Gatorade or something.

Dehydration is the enemy.

All right, have fun. See you later.

I am hungry. What's for dinner?

- What do you want?
- What do you got?

I think there's a couple of steaks
in the freezer.

I want chicken.

It's just wrong.

So very, very wrong.

- You full?
- Yeah.

- Good.
- Why, what else we got?

- You said you were full.
- I am.

Good.

But what else we got?

Sorry, I'm late.
I had to go to the office...

...for an emergency,
and I got a flat tire.

And so I had to wait for the auto club
to come and change it.

And I didn't have my card.

And the guy had to check me
on the computer...

...even though I've been a member
since 1989.

And that's why it took until now
for me to get back.

Thought you were here.

I missed you, Alan.

Thank you. Can I speak with you
for a minute?

- Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's for dessert?
- You said were full.

Not for dessert.

- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

How do you not kill him?

Charlie, I feel horrible
about what I'm doing.

Then you're doing it wrong.

No, I feel like
I'm abandoning my child.

Weren't you listening?
He didn't even notice you were gone.

That's not the point.

What kind of man chooses sex
with an insatiably hot stranger...

...over quality time with his little boy?

I don't know, a man who was married
for 12 years and had sex 12 times.

You're right, I deserve this.

Exactly, so go enjoy yourself.

Well, I do have the room
the whole night.

Yeah, most of your better hotels
prefer you do it that way.

Just make sure Jake goes to bed early.
He's got karate in the morning.

- Which, of course, you'll be back for.
- Charlie, trust me.

You, I trust.
It's him I'm worried about.

What?

Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
I have to take him to karate?

Alan, it's 6:30 in the morning.

What kind of maniac broad
did you hook up with?

She's incredible, Charlie.
I've never met anyone like her.

Gotta go.

Jake, wake up.

Well, I tried.

- Anybody home?
- Right here.

Where's Jake?

I don't know.
Didn't he have a karate tournament?

Yes. You were supposed to take him
three hours ago.

- Why didn't you take him?
- He wouldn't get up.

I tried everything.

What time did he go to bed?

I don't know. I crashed around 2
and he was still going strong.

He was up past 2?

He said he's had coffee before,
but that was a lie, right?

Okay, okay, all right, it's not important.
The karate was his mother's idea. Listen.

I need to ask you for another favor.

Oh, come on, put it in the holster,
Wild Bill.

No, no, no. This isn't about sex.

I need you to watch Jake
for the rest of the weekend...

...so that Nancy and I can go to Vegas
and get married.

Oh, God, Alan. There's no need
to marry the woman.

If you don't wanna have sex anymore,
just tell her.

No, no, you don't understand.

This is beyond sex.

We're in love.

Alan, come here.

You are not in love, you're besotted.

No, no, no, I have never felt like this
about a woman before.

We have a bond
that transcends the physical.

- Really?
- Yeah.

- Kind of a spiritual thing?
- Yes.

Okay. I can understand that.
So where's she from?

She's from around here.

- Where?
- Supermarket.

Charlie, stop that.

I have thought this through and I am
really and truly in love with...

- Nancy.
- I knew that. I knew that.

I was looking for the proper adjective
to describe her.

Nuts? Easy? Limber?

Charlie. Charlie, you started off
on the wrong foot with my first wife.

Do not make the same mistake with...

...wonderful Nancy.

Okay, you're right. This is not about her.
Come here. Sit down.

- You gonna hit me?
- Well, let's see how it goes.

Okay, look, I've never been
much of a big brother to you.

I didn't protect you. I wasn't
around when you started dating...

...when you got married and had Jake.
You know why?

- Why?
- I was busy getting laid.

Which makes me the perfect big brother
to help you now.

I've been through this. I know
what it means to confuse sex with love.

That's not what I'm doing, Charlie.

We're talking about me, and I've
been down this road many times.

I remember this one girl.

We had this unbelievably
hot weekend together.

It was like nothing I'd ever
experienced before, and I proposed.

- I begged her to marry me.
- Wow, where did you meet?

Detention.

- This was in high school?
- Eighth grade.

And then years later, it happened again
with a different woman.

Instant chemistry.
The sex was unbelievable.

I was convinced we were soul mates,
so I threw myself at her.

I did everything
to get her to marry me.

And you know what?
If she'd said yes...

...I'd now have a 67-year-old ex-wife
on a belly dancer's pension.

So, what I'm trying to say...

...is you're not the first guy
to mistake passion for true love...

...and you won't be the last.

If someone had told me
what I'm telling you...

...I could have saved myself
a lot of heartache.

Okay. I hear you. Thank you.

You're welcome.

So make sure Jake doesn't fill up on junk
food, and I'll call you from Circus Circus.

Circus Circus?

You're right, money should be no object.
What's the hotel with the pirate show?

I'm sorry, Alan,
but I'm gonna have to knock you out.

- Hello?
- Mom, thank God you're here.

Oh, I don't need
your sarcasm, Charlie.

No, I mean it. I need you.
Alan needs you.

What's going on?

Alan, tell Mom your plans
for the weekend.

- No.
- Why? Embarrassed?

- No. No.
- Ashamed?

- Scared?
- Yes.

Sweetheart, I'm your mother.
You can tell me anything.

Okay. I met a wonderful woman
in the supermarket a few days ago...

...and we're getting married.

I see.

For God's sake, if you're that horny,
find a nice call girl, put her on retainer.

This is not about sex.

Oh, please. What else could it be?

- Well, it could be love.
- Yeah. Sure.

Who is this woman?
What does she do?

She does Alan.

Okay, okay, that...
That is how it started...

...but in the last day and a half
it has blossomed into so much more.

Oh, my randy little nincompoop.

Listen, if I had gotten married...

...after every weekend of hot, sweaty
debauchery with a virtual stranger...

...you'd have, well, many more
stepfathers than you already have.

She knows what
she's talking about, Alan.

Mom's been on more hotel pillows
than a chocolate mint.

Don't help me, Charlie.

Now... Now, listen, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, no offense...

...but since you're dirt-poor
and living with your brother...

...one must ask, what kind of woman
would agree to marry you?

Unless she's a little slow,
or looking for a green card.

Listen to your mommy, Alan.

No. No, I am gonna listen to my heart.

For your information,
she hasn't agreed to marry me.

- I haven't even asked her yet.
- But you're planning to?

- Yes.
- I'm not going to hit you, darling.

Charlie.

Okay, look, I will thank you both
to let me live my own life.

I love Nancy, and Nancy loves me.

And if this is a mistake,
then it will be my mistake.

Hello? Nancy. You miss me?
I miss you.

Listen, there's something I wanna
ask you, but I wanna do it in person.

Oh, oh, okay, okay. I understand.

Yeah, sure. Sure. Bye.

Her husband came back a day early.

Okay, my mistake.

- You hungry?
- What do we got?

What do you want?

I don't know. What are my choices?

You can cook something,
or go live on the street.

I'm not hungry.

.......... ********** ..........

I decided if I was gonna
get my boobs done...

...I might as well go whole-hog,
you know what I mean?

Yeah, I know what you mean.

They're still pretty natural-Iooking,
don't you think?

They fooled me.

Oh, yeah, gotta get right up on them
before you can tell.

I think they're really gonna help me
reach my career goals.

Do you remember what they were?

What what were?

My career goals.

Yeah, sure.
You wanna be an actress, right?

No, silly. I wanna be a talk show host.

Right.

Of course, what they don't tell you is:
Big boobies equal bad back.

Say that three times fast.

- No, thank you.
- Big boobies equal bad back.

Big boobies equal bad back.
Big boobies equal bad back.

Get your skinny little butt in here,
and I'll interview you standing up.

I'll be right there.

Okay, we're back.

Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome
to my next guest...

...and my close personal friend,
Charlie Harper.

Hey. Where you off to?

I don't know. Anywhere.

Charlie, the shower's still running.

Oh, fine.

There you are.

Charlie! Charlie, help me!

- What's going on?
- Nothing. Go watch TV.

Yeah, right.

Well, I'm sorry, Alan, but who told you
to go sticking your hand in my shower?

Oh, please. How can she sue you?
You have no money.

Oh, boy.

Nothing. Just saw an old girlfriend.
Talk to you later.

Lisa?

Oh, boy.

Charlie. I don't believe it.

- You look great.
- You too.

Although if you're taking votes, I prefer
the brown sock to the beige one.

What? Oh, I got kind of dressed
in a hurry this morning.

Really? Did somebody's husband
come home early?

Why do you always assume the worst?
Can't I just be hung-over?

Sorry. So how are you?

Fine. I mean, you know, considering.

And you? How's married life?

Really great.
Best decision I ever made.

You deserve all the
happiness in the world...

...and you found a guy who can give it.
- Thanks. That's very sweet.

- I mean it sincerely. It warms my heart...
- Okay, we broke up.

Oh, I am so, so sorry. Honestly.

Yes. Yes.

- So, what happened?
- None of your business.

Okay.

I thought he was the sweetest guy
in the world...

...but after we got married,
he changed.

He started drinking a lot,
and lying around the house all day.

Oh, no.

I caught him in the shower
with some bimbo.

Some guys, huh?

Yeah. If I wanted that kind of life,
I could have stayed with you.

Good point.
So, what are you doing for dinner?

- You're shameless.
- Thank you.

- It's not a compliment.
- Whatever.

What are you doing for dinner?

Charlie, a lot has changed.

I know. I'm older and wiser,
and you're hot and on the rebound.

- Charlie.
- Dinner tonight.

I won't take no for an answer.

Hey, lady.
Lady, you forgot your baby.

Charlie, it's not her baby.

Shall we say 7?

Just out of curiosity, what the hell
happened in your brother's bathroom?

- Nothing.
- Dad was wrestling on the floor...

...with a naked lady.

The quiet ones are always the freaks.

- Jake, I was not wrestling.
- But she was naked.

She was taking a shower,
and I didn't know.

When I reached to turn it off,
she was startled.

It was innocent and there's no reason
to tell your mother, understand?

Sure. By the way,
you have to sign my math test.

Okay. D minus?
Jake, how do you get a D minus?

How do you get wrapped
in a shower curtain...

...with a naked lady?

- Did you show this to your mother?
- No.

- Why not?
- I didn't catch her doing anything.

Okay, I'll sign this.

But you are gonna go study
so this won't happen again.

All right, but I wouldn't
get my hopes up.

If you want something from Dad,
now's a good time.

Oh, Alan, I am having the best day.

- Really? Do share it with me.
- Remember Lisa?

Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slapped
me in your shower this morning?

No, that's Meegan...

...or Megan or Sue.

Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry,
but she married this other guy instead.

They're divorced and we're
having dinner. Isn't that great?

I'd applaud, but my hand
was bitten earlier.

I'm sensing you're upset?

Oh, no, no, no.
Why would I be upset?

I mean, besides the...
The bite and the mild concussion...

...that I got from my head bouncing
off your bathroom floor...

...while your shower buddy
was driving her knee into my groin.

She wants to be a talk show host.
I don't see it. Not with that voice.

And to top it all off, my son
saw me entwined on the floor...

...with Meegan or Megan or Sue...

...and is now blackmailing me.

Kid's a genius.

Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa.

She's got a kid now.

I'm not sure where I'm at
with having an instant family.

I'm sorry. Are we done
with what's bothering me?

I am.

It's like talking to a horny chimp.

Well, that was uncalled for.

- So, what do you think?
- About what?

Lisa, me, the kid.

Okay, let's see now.

This is the same woman
you've broken up...

...and gotten back with for years, right?
- Right.

And she turned you down
in order to marry somebody else?

- Yes.
- And then the marriage fell apart...

...and now she's got his baby?
- Yeah.

Sounds perfect. Go for it.

Okay, don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

Are you gonna be okay?

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

It's just nobody's taken a crap
in my car since college.

Don't be such a baby.

Hey, tell her.

I'll change her diaper while your car
airs out. Then you can take us home.

But what if it happens again?

Don't worry. I'll hold her out
the window till we arrive.

Thank you.
Can I make you a nightcap?

Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember?

Oh, right, right.

And may I say, on behalf
of myself, the maître d'...

...and the entire kitchen staff that found
a reason to walk past our table:

You're doing a hell of a job.

Look at what a good
poopie you made.

Mommy's gonna get you
all cleaned up.

- Would you throw this away?
- Sure.

You didn't throw that
on the beach, did you?

No, no. I threw it
on my neighbor's deck.

Long story. He started it.

- So how we doing?
- All done.

Oh, good.

Boy, you hear all these horror stories
about screaming babies...

...but she's not half bad.

She's my little angel.

Kind of weird, huh?
You and me and a baby.

Yeah.

Not that the baby's weird.
It's just the whole, you know, gestalt.

You are so sweet.

I know.

Wanna go upstairs?

- No, I have to go home.
- Why?

What do you mean, why?
I have a baby.

Okay, she can stay too.

I can't spend the night.
I didn't bring enough diapers...

...the bassinet.
I don't have a breast pump.

So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

What are you gonna do, Charlie?
Milk me?

What kind of thing is that to say?

What makes you think I'm ready
to jump back into bed with you?

I don't know. Because I'm sweet?

You weren't ready when I was single.

How are you gonna
handle me and a baby?

Easy. I love babies, babies love me.
Look how good I get along with Jake.

Jake's 11.

So? He was 10 when I met him.

Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they?

- Okay, look. If you're serious...
- I am.

- Come over tomorrow night to our place.
I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens.

Or we go to your place now...

...having already eaten,
and see what happens.

Still incapable of delaying
gratification, aren't you?

No, no, no, I've grown.

I learned to put the needs
of others before me.

- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

The old thoughtless,
selfish Charlie is gone...

...and I say good riddance to him.

Now, come on.
I'll take you home.

- Charlie?
- Yeah?

The baby.

This makes no sense.

It's math. It makes perfect sense.

Well, then I guess we'll just
have to agree to disagree.

No, you just have to do the work.

Well, maybe I have a learning disability,
or a syndrome of some sort.

You don't have a learning disability.
You're just lazy.

Maybe that's the syndrome.

See you later. And by "later,"
I'm hoping tomorrow.

Is there anything in your shower
I need to know about?

Oh, come on. That's the most
action you've had in months.

I have a loose tooth.

Can't you just be happy for me?
The woman I love is back in my life.

That's great. I'm thrilled.
I can't eat apples.

I'll bring you back some
applesauce from Lisa's.

Her kid needs to lay off
the fiber anyway.

Oh, yeah. How's that working out?

With the kid? She's great. I love kids.

Really? Tell me. How many
diapers have you changed so far?

Well, none, actually.
But I am credited with an assist.

- Have you fed the baby?
- No.

- Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby?
- No. What's your point, Alan?

- Nothing. Have fun.
- Thanks.

I intend to.

Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

- What was that?
- Coyotes, Charlie.

Probably dropped her pacifier.
I'll be right back.

- No, no, no. You stay. I'll take care of it.
- Really?

Oh, yeah. No problem.
I'm great with babies.

Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right?

Be right back.

Hey, little baby, you decent?

Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie.

Not as good as the real thing,
am I right?

Smells like one of us
just crapped our pants.

I sure hope it's you.

Let's take a look.

Charlie? You okay?

- What?
- Is everything okay?

Oh, yeah. Just a little
diaper issue. I can take care of it.

And then I'll be back
to take care of you.

Okay. Let's just take this thing off.

Oh, sweet Lord.

Did you have Thai food
for dinner, or what?

Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps.

Do you need any help?

What?

Do you need any help?

No, we're good.

Okay. Now we wipe the tushy.

Sorry. It's not you. It's me.

Wipe it again. Third time's the charm.

Little powder. Oh, that smells nice.

Maybe a little powder for my tushy.
Don 't tell your mommy.

Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor.

Oh, right.

People of Earth...

... we mean you no harm.

See? This one is wrong, this is wrong.
Jake, you have to check your work.

These are careless mistakes.

Maybe I'm not careless.
Maybe I ate lead paint as a child.

- Here. Do it again.
- Fine.

Dad, are you and Mom related?

I'm sorry. What?

Well, if you marry your cousin,
your kids will be stupid, right?

Jake, you're not stupid,
your mother's not my cousin...

...and you're not going anywhere
until you do your homework.

Like I have somewhere to go.

There we go.
You were a hungry little girl.

Of course she was hungry.

She must of dropped half her
body weight in that last diaper.

What a good burp.
Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie?

Oh, yeah. Wait till you
meet my nephew.

He can belch the theme from Shaft.

All right. Good night, sweetheart.

Oh, there we go.

Now, where were we?

Oh, yeah.

You know, I'm a little tired.
Aren't you tired?

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

Was it the breastfeeding? Because
in the restaurant, it turned you on.

I know, but there I wasn't on deck.

So you don't wanna fool around?

It's not that. I'm looking
at the sexiest woman in the world...

...and all I can see is a Thermos.

Charlie, there are things you do with
your penis that aren't exactly a turn-on.

You mean the puppet show?

I thought you loved The Amazing
Adventures of Stretch Armstrong.

That's not what I meant.
Now, come on. Come to mama.

Okay, time. "Come to mama"
bums me a little.

Can we make it
"Come to Catholic schoolgirl"?

Yes, Monsignor.

Hallelujah.

Here you go. Two sugars, no cream.

Oh, perfect. And I don't mind saying,
last night was none too shabby either.

"Dear diary: Coffee perfect,
sex none too shabby."

You know what I mean.

I can't remember
why we kept breaking up.

- You can't?
- Well, I can. I was just being romantic.

- What are you doing?
- Putting on my pants.

You're leaving already?

No.

So why are you putting
on your pants, then?

I don't know.
Did you wanna wear them?

Forget it.

Hey, I've gotta go home
sooner or later.

- Go home whenever you want.
- I can't leave...

...when you're in this mood.
- What mood?

This mood.

Oh, just leave, Charlie.
It's what you do best.

No, it's what I do after
I do what I do best.

Oh, come on.
I was just putting on my pants.

- You wanna spend the day with us?
- The whole day?

- Here are your shoes.
- Hang on a second.

Is this some hormonal
thing because of the baby?

No, it's some kind of
stupid thing because you're stupid.

Any time I don't behave the way
you want, it's hormonal.

Not every time, but you
gotta admit there is a pattern.

You know the pattern I see?

Every time things start going well for us,
you find an excuse to run.

No, no, no. You push me away.

How? How do I push you away?

Like this. You pick a fight over
nothing and say I can't commit.

- You can't commit.
- Hey, I can commit.

Oh, yeah? Prove it.

Fine. I'll start right now.

I'm gonna stay here all day.

- Really?
- Really.

We're talking a business day, right?

- Hey. How did it go with Lisa?
- I don't think it's gonna work out.

Really? Even with the little baby
there to help smooth things along?

It wasn't the baby.

She has commitment issues.

Oh, that's too bad. Hey, what's that
splattered all over your shirt?

Coffee and breast milk.

What happened?
Did Starbucks merge with Hooters?

Hooterbucks.

I'd like a double-D cup latte, please.

Dad, you gotta sign this.

Another D?
Jake, what is wrong with you?

Well, I have a theory.

Oh, really? Another one. Do tell.

I'm a crack baby.

Kid's a genius.

.......... ********** ..........

- What you doing?
- I'm working.

You're not gonna get much done
with the TV on.

- What are you, my mother?
- Your mother says that too?

Listen, when you write music
for a living...

...you have to wait for inspiration.

Nope, not yet.

Charlie, wanna come
to the movies with us?

He can't. He's working.

- On what, liver failure?
- Wonderful.

He's my mother, you're my doctor.

Oh, I assume you finished reading
Lord of the Flies for your book report.

Oh, good. How'd you like it?

I thought it was
a timeless American classic.

I see. So tell me, what's it about?

- You mean the book?
- Yeah, the book.

It's called Lord of the Flies...

...and it's about a really big fly...

...that all the other flies pray to.

- And you thought he didn't read it.
- Oh, I was just joking.

It's more like Charlotte's Web,
but from the fly's point of view.

You've had more than a week.
Why didn't you read the book?

- I've been waiting for inspiration.
- Attaboy.

Okay, how's this for inspiration?
We're not going to the movies...

...and you're not doing anything
until you finish reading that book.

- That's not fair.
- Course it's fair. We had a deal.

- You didn't keep your end of it.
- Oh, so now two wrongs make a right?

Bet you didn't see that one coming.

You're really gonna like this book
if you give it a chance.

It's about kids
stranded on a deserted island.

- How'd they get stranded?
- Their plane crashes.

Oh, really. And then what happens?

This one kid named Ralph becomes their
leader, and they form this society, and...

Just read the book.

- One big fly, huh?
- Hey, I took a shot.

Hi.

- Charlie's working, Rose.
- Oh, what about Jake?

He's studying.

- Hey, do you like smoked salmon?
- I guess.

Good. Then this is for you.

- I don't know what to say.
- Neither do I, most of the time.

But then I start talking,
and stuff just comes out.

So, what are you doing
this fine Saturday night?

I was supposed go to the movies
with Jake...

...but he didn't
do his homework, so...

So you're punishing him by sitting out
here all by yourself, alone and miserable.

What a good dad.

If you still wanna go to the movies,
I'll go with you.

- You and me? Like a...? Like a date?
- Alan, are you asking me out?

- I don't think so.
- Okay.

That was a little awkward.
Come on, we'll catch an early show.

Oh, all right. All right, why not.

I'll sneak in the salmon
under my sweater.

Good. That way, we don't have to pay
for that overpriced movie fish.

- Hey. What you doing?
- Working.

How do you know
when you're on a break?

That's the thing about being a grownup,
my little friend: You don't get breaks.

Is this the new
Oshikuru: Demon Samuraï?

- Yeah.
- What are you doing with it?

It's being turned into a cartoon, and they
asked me to write the theme song.

- Awesome.
- Yeah?

- Wanna hear what I got so far?
- Sure.

So I'll be, like, the first kid in the world
to hear this.

Yep.

Now, this is just a rough version,
but you get an idea of the feel of it.

Okay.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

Boy. That really blows.

Excuse me?

- Did you even read the comic?
- Yeah, I looked it over.

Oh, really? What's it about?

It's about this guy named Oshikuru,
who dies...

...and comes back as a,
what do you call it, samurai.

- And he's a demon.
- No.

It's about a teenage boy
in a futuristic society...

...who's possessed by the tortured soul
of a feudal Japanese warrior...

...condemned to walk the earth
fighting the evil he once embodied.

So, what's your point?

He lives in a dark world.
He battles the spirits of the damned.

Your theme doesn't
capture the mood at all. It just blows.

- Okay, okay, you said "blows" already.
- Did I say "big baby chunks"?

All right, fine. Thanks for your input.

Why don't you go read Lord of the Flies,
and let me do my job.

Well, if your job is ruining a great
comic book, you can call it a night.

- I heard that.
- Good.

Oh, no. What do you wanna bet
Shrek here sits right in front of us.

Don't worry. It'll be all right.

You had to eat the chili cheeseburger.

- That wasn't really necessary.
- You'd have done the same thing for me.

I'm not so sure.

- So, Alan, tell me about yourself.
- What would you like to know?

Everything. I really don't know
that much about you...

...aside from the fact that you're
Charlie's brother and Jake's dad.

Graduated from Cal State Long Beach,
married your college sweetheart...

...and in the middle of the night, when
you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down.

- Have you been spying on me?
- No, silly.

I spy on Charlie.
You just get in the way sometimes.

You know what?
Why don't you tell me about you.

Well, okay. Well, let's see.

I, too, pee sitting down,
so we have that in common.

I come from a wealthy family, so I guess
I've had kind of a sheltered life.

You know, fancy private schools
and colleges.

- No kidding.
- What college did you go to?

Princeton. But just for two years.

- Oh, so you dropped out?
- No, I finished.

Then I came back to California
to do my master's at Stanford.

That's amazing.
What's your degree in?

Behavioral psychology.

Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up.
I want you to hear something.

- What?
- I've been working on the song.

- Good for you.
- Come on. Come listen to it.

- I'm sleeping.
- Sleep in school, like everybody else.

I read the comic books cover to cover.

I know the characters,
I know their world.

I think I got it. Listen.

A teenage boy with the spirit inside
Of a samurai warrior who long ago died

Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

Still blows.

Yeah, well, you're still short.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Sorry I'm late. We stopped
for a bite to eat after the movie.

- No problem.
- An usher confiscated our fish.

- Hey, can I play you something?
- Sure.

You know, I had a really good time
with Rose.

There's a lot more there
than meets the eye.

Yeah. Cool. Listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

A teenage boy with the spirit inside
Of a samurai warrior who long ago died

Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

Very nice. It's snappy.

- You really like it?
- Yeah, yeah. Good work.

Okay, that settles it. It blows.

Berta, you know what's a good book?
Lord of the Flies.

Oh, yeah. I read that
when I was about your age.

- So, what'd you think?
- I liked it.

- It was like Survivor with kids.
- Yeah. I agree.

- Is Survivor spelled like it sounds?
- Just read the damn book.

- Morning, Berta.
- Morning.

Hey, did you know that Rose
has a master's degree in psychology?

No. Did you know I'm a
founding member of the Mile High Club?

- Really?
- Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk.

I'd have done Wilbur too, but we were
only in the air for 90 seconds.

Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny.

But the truth is, you and I
see each other every day...

...and we don't know
much about each other.

So you wanna know what goes on
underneath this gruff exterior.

Whether somewhere inside me,
there's a tiny little girl...

...who once dreamed of being
a famous ballerina.

- Is there?
- Lf there is...

...it's because I accidentally ate one
and haven't passed her yet.

Let me tell you,
I am dreading that tiara.

- Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you.
- Hey, I feel closer.

Oh, are you starting
that book report already?

- Just making notes.
- Good for you. What do you have so far?

Lord of the Flies is kind of like Survivor,
but with kids.

That's an interesting analogy.
What's your favorite part?

When the first kid
gets voted off the island?

Hey, all right.

Stop trying to be friends with Berta.
It just pisses her off.

What doesn't?

Hey, I was gonna do some shopping,
and was hoping you could watch Jake.

- Sure.
- Ready when you are, Alan.

- Be right there. I'll see you later.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

- You're going out with Rose again?
- No, I'm not "going out" with her.

- We're just going shopping.
- Morning, Charlie.

You haven't forgotten
that she's a little bent, right?

No, I think there's a lot more to her
than that.

- Deep down, there's a good person.
- Deep down, there's a few good people.

And all of them are bent.

- He'll be right with you, Rose.
- Okay.

- Charlie, everybody has flaws.
- Flaws?

She Superglued my testicles
to my thigh.

That was the past.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.

She's not ashamed. She took a picture,
then used it for her Christmas card.

Thank God it was an extreme close-up.
Most people thought it was a fruit bat.

Okay, well,
I appreciate your concern...

...but I think Rose is a sweet,
smart, interesting woman.

I enjoy spending time with her.
Meet me out front.

Okey-dokey.

- Hey, what're you doing?
- Reading Lord of the Flies.

Not important.

- Now, listen. You're a kid, right?
- Yeah.

Okay. I'm writing a song for kids.

So assuming that
what I've done already blows...

- It does.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Assuming that, you need to help me
make it better.

- But I have to do a book report.
- Okay.

I'll help you with the book report.
You help me with the song.

- Quid pro quo.
- No.

"Oshikuru."

Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banana
with a shot of wheatgrass.

- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

You know, sometimes
I like to come to the mall...

...and just watch people and make up
stories about who they are...

...and what their lives are like.
- Oh, well, that's fun.

What about that lady over there?
What do you think her life is like?

Well, I'd say she's a smart woman,
but very Ionely.

So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

...which is all the more sad
because she's got so much to give.

Emotionally, spiritually, sexually.
Especially sexually.

She is ripe, smoldering
and willing to try anything.

- What about that lady over there?
- Her?

Well, let's see.
She's a little tougher to read.

I'd say she's a smart woman,
very Ionely.

So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

...which is all the more sad...

See, even though Oshikuru is for kids,
it's not really a kids' comic.

- It's very mature.
- Okay, I think I got it.

The demons Oshikuru fights
only exist...

...because they are a reflection
of the tortured demons in his own soul.

- Yes.
- So, in essence...

...Oshikuru is like a Japanese
sci-fi version of Moby Dick.

- What?
- You said, "Moby Dick."

I mean, sure, being single
can be Ionely sometimes...

...but it's better than being together
with someone you don't love or respect.

- Is that what your marriage was like?
- Well, according to my ex-wife, it was.

Hey, as long as we're done here...

...why don't we take a drive
down to the beach and take a walk.

- Alan, are you flirting with me?
- Oh, no, no.

I just thought, you know,
since it's a beautiful day...

If you are, it's okay.

- Really?
- Yeah.

There's a lot more to you
than I thought.

- What did you think?
- Oh, let's not spoil the moment.

Okay. So, what do we do now?

- Wanna try kissing?
- Yes, I think we should.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

- Wanna get a room?
- Excuse me?

Or we can go back to my place,
unless you're afraid of ferrets.

- Ferrets?
- Yeah.

I have five of the toothy little guys.

No kidding. Five ferrets.

- Those are like long, furry rats, right?
- Yep.

And they're all named Charlie.

Of course they are.

Well, as much as I would
love to meet...

...Charlie and Charlie
and Charlie and Charlie...

- And Charlie.
- Right.

I can't help but wonder, is it worth
putting our friendship at risk?

Well, that's a good question.
Let's think about it for a minute.

How good are you in bed?
Because I'm excellent.

Truthfully, I'm more of
an advanced intermediate.

- Then let's stay friends.
- Yeah, good idea.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

What, specifically, turned you off
to the idea of a physical liaison?

Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry,
symbolized by the Charlie surrogates?

Or the prospect
of being judged inadequate...

...by a woman who professes to have
superior sexual skills?

Wait a minute. Have you been doing
that behavioral psychology thing on me?

No, don't be silly.

But if I said yes, would that
make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure?

I thought you were gonna
write the report for me.

No, Jake. That would be wrong.

The only way to learn
is to do the work yourself.

Now, these are called Cliff Notes.

Inside is everything you need to know
about Lord of the Flies.

The themes, the characters,
the symbolism.

It's a book report waiting for you
to put your name on it.

Is that legal?

Look around.
Do you see any homework police?

Oh, man. I give you
way too much credit.

Oh, I meant to ask you,
how'd that book report turn out?

- I got a D-minus.
- D-minus?

- Didn't you read the Cliff Notes?
- That was 50 pages.

Unbelievable. Your kid's too lazy
to cheat.

Has it occurred to you that maybe
he's too honest to cheat?

No, I'm lazy.

- Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
- Hey, it's on.

Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru
Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru

My, oh, my
He's a demon samurai

Who 's the guy who had to die?
Oshikuru

That's not what we wrote.
That's your original, sucky version.

What can I tell you?
The network liked that one better.

- What, are they brain-damaged?
- Welcome to show business, kid.

I still think it's snappy.

Oshikuru

.......... ********** ..........

Two white wines
and a Jack and ginger.

Please tell me the Jack and ginger
isn't for you.

No, it's for my girlfriend. Why?

You look like a woman of
discriminating taste...

...and mixing a quality
bourbon with ginger ale...

...is like putting Cheez Whiz
on lobster Newburgh.

Well, what if I said
the Jack and ginger was for me?

Well, then, I'd learn to live with it.

- Charlie.
- Gail.

Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio
Barn, and wait till you see what I got.

Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of...

Damn you to hell.

- What? What did I do?
- Forget it.

It's who you are,
you can't help yourself.

Okay. Anyway, check this out.
Know what that is?

- A two megapixel, full-color webcam.
- Right.

How do I do it?

I got one for me and for Jake.
We can hook them to our computers...

...so when he's at his mother's,
we can have video chats.

- That's cool.
- Isn't it?

Yeah, with a couple of these, phone sex
becomes less phone and more sex.

These are to maintain
my relationship with Jake.

It's the worst part of the divorce:

- Only seeing him on weekends.
- I get that. I sympathize.

But you can see the validity
of my vision too, right?

Oh, look. Built-in microphone.
Totally hands-free. Perfect.

- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again.

Don't move, don't talk.

- Are you Charlie Harper?
- Yeah. Why?

You were right. It's him.

What...? What...? What's funny?

Nothing.

So listen, can I buy you a drink?

He wants to buy me a drink.

Then what? We go back
to your beach house...

...sit on the deck, look at the stars, talk
about how you love being an uncle...

...and how you'd
like kids of your own...

...and by the way, I have the
most beautiful eyes in the world.

I'm sorry. Have we met before?

No. And we're not gonna meet now.

Okay. I have a bad feeling.

Is the camera on?

Good. Now, hit "connect."

I can see you. Can you see me?

Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too.
You can hang up the phone.

This is awesome.

- Yeah, we can see each other every day.
- Cool.

So...

What's new?

Nothing.

What's new with you?

Not much.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Rose, stop.

- What?
- We're friends now, right?

Right.

Our one-night stand is ancient history.
You're not stalking me anymore, right?

- Right.
- Then use the damn stairs.

- Really?
- Yes.

Okay.

- I'm opening up the gate.
- I'm proud of you.

- I'm starting up the stairs.
- You can do it.

Oh, boy.

I don't know about this.

- You'll get used to it.
- Yeah, we'll see.

I'm surprised to see you home.

- It's ladies' night at Pavlov's.
- I know.

Well, isn't that kind of like
rabbit season for Elmer Fudd?

Used to be.

Let me ask you question.

How much do chicks talk
about men they've been with?

Not as much as you'd think.

- Really?
- Way more.

- Why?
- Well, I ran into some women last night.

Never met them before.

But they seem to have already formed
a poor opinion of me.

So you think somebody's out there
spreading nasty rumors?

Worse. I think somebody's out there
spreading the truth.

Well, you have burned
a few bridges in this town.

Hey, I don't burn bridges.
I have casual sex with relative strangers.

There's a difference.

And I'm always honest.

I never lead a woman on.
Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed.

Last night was probably the result
of one woman with an ax to grind.

Probably.

Yeah, that's it.

- I'm making myself crazy over nothing.
- Oh, I do that all the time.

It's a great way to fill up
a slow weekend.

Rose, that night we spent together...

...did I tell you
you had beautiful eyes?

Well, let's see. We had a couple
of drinks, you invited me back here.

We were sitting out on the deck,
looking at the stars.

And, yeah, you said:

"By the way, you have
the most beautiful eyes in the world."

I guess I do use that a lot.

But, damn it, it's good.

Are you sure it's not red?
Look again.

It looks fine.
You have to go to school tomorrow.

- Good night, Rose.
- Night, Charlie.

And don't forget to use the...

Never mind.

Oh, Charlie, Charlie.
Come here.

- Say hello to your Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.

- Hi, Jake.
- I can see you.

I can see you too.

So...

What's new?

Not much.
What's new with you?

Nothing. Oh, wait.
I Googled you...

... and you'll never guess
what I found.

Jake, are you in the bathtub?

Yeah. Gotta go.

No, no, no. Wait, Jake,
what are you talking about?

- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

But if you Google me,
you'll find pages that mention...

...my San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year award.

That's nice.
Get out of the way.

Oh, careful. There's another
Alan J. Harper.

He's a school bus driver, and he also
makes these decorative pigs...

...out of bleach bottles
and pipe cleaners.

I'm not Googling you.
I'm Googling me.

"CharlieHarperSucks. Com."

That's gotta be a different
Charlie Harper.

Okay.

I have a bad feeling.

Oh, boy.

Oh, man.

Oh, crap.

- Are you still reading that thing?
- How can I not?

It's an entire website
devoted to trashing me.

Listen to this:

"Has anybody had sex with Charlie
where he actually took his socks off?"

That's just mean.
I have bad circulation in my feet.

They get cold.

Check this out. Some girl posted audio
off her answering machine.

Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell you
I had a great time last night.

- And I'm looking forward...
- Hello, Charlie?

Yeah, hi.

We weren 't together last night.

Allison?

No, Beth.

Thursday.

I had a great time with you Thursday,
and I thought that may...

Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do?

Every woman in the city
can see this stuff.

Every woman in the world.

Oh, God.

Well, you know what they say.

Any publicity is...

Good publicity.

No, no, no.
What I do requires secrecy.

I need shadows and darkness.
I'm like a magician.

If everybody knows how I do it,
it ceases to be entertaining.

"Frequently Asked Questions."

- Don't read that.
- Yeah, right.

Okay. Question:

"How long can you expect to date
Charlie after you have sex with him?"

Answer: " It depends how late
you sleep the next morning."

Oh, come on. This is funny.
You're just too close to it.

This could be interesting. Question:

"How does Charlie manage
to fake my orgasm?"

All right, stop it. Move over.

- What are you doing?
- I've gotta fight back.

Anybody can post on the message board.
Why not me?

- You're gonna post as yourself?
- Don't be ridiculous.

Everybody uses a screen name.

"CharlieFreak219."

Too many?

Okay.

CharlieFreak180.

"In my experience...

...Charlie has always been...

...a generous lover...

...compassionate, fun-Ioving
and sensitive."

There. That ought to bring
a little balance to the conversation.

You really don't get the Internet,
do you?

Oh, look. I've got a response already.

"Dear Freak: Are you just stupid...

...or did your skull bounce off
his headboard too many times?"

Okay, I've had enough of this.

- How do I delete this whole thing?
- You can't delete a website.

Only the person who created it can.

- Well, how do I find out who created it?
- Now, let's see. Come on.

Okay.

Okay, the domain is the property of a
company in the Cayman Islands called:

"Charlie Harper Sucks Limited."

Well, that's no help.

Hey, you can buy T-shirts
and coffee mugs.

"Add to cart."

No, Mom, it is not that simple.

I am a single mother now.
Dating is very complicated.

I understand.

No, I can 't go back to Alan.

Of course I still love him.

Hey, Alan?

How long you think this Internet fad
is gonna last?

- Okay.
- What?

Jake must've turned on his webcam
before he went to school.

I can see and hear Judith
talking to her mother on the phone.

- Why can't she hear us?
- Our side's turned off.

Are you kidding? Alan would never
take me back. How do I know?

I just know.

Okay, fine. I'll ask him.

- She wants me back.
- Yes, I will ask him.

That's nice. It's all about you.

Okay.

Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower.

I got it. Yes.

All right. I'll call you later.

Oh, man.

- Charlie, I need to talk about this.
- Me too.

If I don't do something
about that website...

...I'm gonna have to chase
Amish broads.

Judith wants to reconcile.
I've dreamed about this...

...but now that it's here,
I wonder if it's what I want.

Whoever put up that site has to be
somebody I went out with at least once.

It would be great for Jake
to have both parents in one house.

And without alimony, I could stop
getting my hair cut at the barber college.

I can eliminate married chicks,
ones that don't speak English...

...and those to whom
I was never properly introduced.

I'll make a list of the pros and cons
of going back to her.

You know what?
I'm gonna need to make a list.

- I'm glad we talked.
- I'm always here for you.

Me too.

Hi, Tina. Long time, huh?

Charlie Harper. What do you want?

I know things didn't end well
between us, and...

Really? I thought they ended perfectly.

We spent a week in Cancún,
having great sex every day.

Flew back to L.A. You told me you'd
call me tomorrow, and it's been...

What do you know?
A year and a half.

- That long?
- Oh, yeah.

I guess time flies when
you're the scum of the earth.

Okay, I had that coming.

I was thoughtless and insensitive, and I
know I can never really make up for it...

...but I want you to know that I was
wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry.

- And...?
- No "and."

I just wanted to apologize for
being a jerk. I wanna make amends.

- You really mean that, don't you?
- I do. Absolutely.

- You wanna come in for a cup of coffee?
- Sure, I guess.

So, seeing anybody?

"Pro: No alimony. Con: No sex."

"Pro: See Jake all the time.
Con: See Judith all the time."

What are you doing? Give me that.

- I'm sorry. It was just laying there.
- That's private.

Okay.

I got another "pro" for you.

- Yeah? What's that?
- Lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl...

...I won't have to scrub your toilet
anymore.

Pro: No more Berta.

You're not really thinking about
going back, are you?

I don't know.
She wants to, but I'm torn.

You're not torn. You're gutless.

- Do you still love her?
- Of course I do.

I mean, you know, we've been though
a lot of things together.

- She's the mother of my son.
- Okay, listen to me, Zippy.

If that's all it took
to make a marriage...

...I'd have a husband
for each of my tattoos.

- You have tattoos?
- Yeah. You wanna see them?

No.

You're overthinking this. When your
dog dies, you don't make a list.

You bury him, plant a shrub on top...

...tell the kids he's running around
a farm, and move on.

That's actually a very apt metaphor.

My failed marriage is like a dead dog.

But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub,
which represents my new life.

So if I try to revitalize the marriage...
You know, digging up the dog.

- Then I'm killing the shrub,
which is me.

Like you said, it's apt.

Thank you, Berta.
You're a very insightful woman.

I know. In a just world,
you'd be washing my shorts.

Well, thanks, nevertheless.

Last chance to see those tattoos.

No thanks.

I can make the Road Runner
do jumping jacks.

That was a fun apology.

Yeah, I really thought
I was the one who deserved a spanking.

- So you'll call me?
- Count on it.

Hey, not that I really care, but,
do you happen to know...

...who started that silly website?

No. I just found it
by Googling your name.

Most women Google
the guys they go out with, you know.

Yeah, I've heard.

- Well, I'll see you soon.
- You better.

Okay. That went well.

Let's see. Who's next?

Jake, why don't you go watch
some TV. I need to talk to your dad.

Is this about the firecrackers?
What firecrackers?

I'll go watch TV.

Come in, sit down.

Thanks. Listen...

- Boy, this is tough.
- Okay, okay, maybe...

...I can make it easier for you.

Judith...

...I will always love you...

...but there's no going back for me.

I've learned a lot about myself
in the last year, and I'm growing.

And... And I wanna keep on growing.

I will always cherish
what we had...

...but I have to fertilize my shrub.

- What are you talking about?
- It's Berta's metaphor.

The... The bottom line is:
I don't want to reconcile.

Our marriage is over.

Well, what makes you think
I wanna reconcile?

What did you wanna talk to me about?

My mom wanted me to ask
if Jake could spend a couple of weeks...

...with them this summer.
- Oh, really?

- That's what she wanted you to ask me?
- Yes.

You didn't tell her you loved me,
you missed me?

Well, I always tell her that
to shut her up.

And how the hell do you know
what I talk to my mother about?

Hey, look, Charlie's here.

- Answer my question, Alan.
- Hold on a second, Judith.

- Charlie, what's wrong?
- I've been making amends.

Five amends in one afternoon.

Well, technically, four.
I had to fake the last one.

- Charlie, Alan and I are talking.
- Don't worry.

I'll be out of your way as soon
as I check on something.

They all denied
running the website...

...but at least I should have
some good reviews now.

Listen to this:

"Charlie came over and apologized today,
and, oh, what an apology it was.

I take back everything nasty
I ever said about him."

Not bad, huh?

Here's another one:

"He apologized to you today?

He apologized to me too."

Okay, I have a bad feeling again.

Alan, how do you know what
I said to my mother?

I didn't actually know.
I surmised.

I should go talk to Charlie.

Hey, Dad, check it out.
I can see my room on your computer.

Okay, now I've got a bad feeling.

My heart was in the right place, Rose.

- I know.
- All I wanted to do was apologize.

- I had no ulterior motives.
- I believe you.

Thank you.

Did I ever apologize to you?

You mean, for our one-night stand
that kind of, sort of broke my heart?

Yeah, for that.

No, not really.

Okay, well, I am truly sorry.

You're a wonderful person,
and you deserved better.

Thank you, Charlie.

- That's sweet.
- I mean it.

- What's that?
- Oh, this?

It's one of those new
web browser, e-mail gadgets.

Cool.

.......... ********** ..........

- What's that?
- My high school yearbook.

Hey, do you remember a
girl named Jamie Eckelberry?

- No.
- Yeah, sure you do.

She used to hang out
at the house all the time.

Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound.

Not a name she was fond of.

Hey, I didn't make it up.
I just spread it around. What about her?

Oh, she called the alumni association
and tracked me down.

How does that work? They let her
sniff one of your sweaters?

She e-mailed me. She's in town
on business, and I invited her over.

Great. I'll get out of your way.
Just keep her off the good rug.

Very funny. No. For your
information, it's not a date.

She's just a friend who has become
very successful in her field.

Oh, that's nice that she
has a field to run around in.

- It's getting old, Charlie.
- In people years or dog years?

Sorry. Oh, look.
You remember Miss Hanrahan?

- Sure. I had her for sophomore English.
- I had her in the teachers' lounge.

Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice.

I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan.

- I'm serious.
- Relax. I'm just gonna say hello...

...scratch her behind the ear,
and then I'm out of here.

- You done with the dog jokes?
- Yes.

- Good.
- I hope she looks fetching.

Okay, I guess I had one more.

- Alan.
- Jamie.

Do you remember how Stuart Negelman
used to tell everybody you were gay?

Don't remind me.
I had one Boy George album...

...and suddenly
I'm queen of the fairies.

You'll be happy to know
I ran into him in New York.

- And? Knew it.
- Gay.

Okay, here we go.

Two margaritas,
and a rum and Diet Coke.

- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down,
or singing show tunes on a float?

Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo.

Speaking of which, you look
like you're in good shape.

- I have kept up with the hacky sack.
- Good for you.

And you. I cannot get over what
a beautiful woman you've become.

- Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me.
- Too bad. It's true.

Charlie, that's lovely. You still play.

Just professionally.

- You became a musician?
- More a composer. Gotta pay the bills.

Play the jingle you wrote for the
feminine deodorant commercial.

Okay.

Fresh as a summer breeze
Clean as a mountain spring

No. You wrote that? I love that.

Hey, hey, did I tell you
that I was voted...

...Chiropractor of the Year by the San
Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association?

Oh, that's fantastic, Alan.
You must be very proud.

Well, it's not pride so much as the
satisfaction I get from helping people.

Carefree, so carefree

What every woman wants to be

Hey. Hey, you know
what would be fun?

A session of Dungeons & Dragons.
Like the old days, you know?

- Just the two of us.
- Wow, I haven't played in years.

Or we can go down to the beach
and go for a swim.

- I didn't bring a suit.
- So my plan is working.

You know, I think I'll take a rain check.
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

Down the hall on the right.

Thank you.

Don't you have enough women?

No. Anyway, you said she
was just an old friend.

Well, that was before I saw her.

Come on, I spent years
laying the groundwork for this.

And yet you never erected
anything on the site.

Because she didn't look like that then.

Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper.

Don't you know a woman is so much
more than what's on the outside?

She's a mountain spring,
a summer breeze and I saw her first.

What are you, 11?

Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful,
she's the kind of woman who...

- You could never get?
- Exactly.

Well, if she's that important to you.

She is, she is. Very much.

- Okay, fine. I'm out of it.
- Really?

Happy birthday.

Isn't that presumptuous? You think you
can just give this woman as a gift?

- Okay, forget it.
- No, no. Happy birthday to me.

Listen, I have an early meeting in the
morning, so I should probably get going.

Oh, no, no. The night is so young,
and Charlie was just leaving.

Yeah, if I don't start drinking now,
I'll be up all night.

I really have to get going.
What about dinner tomorrow night?

- That would be great.
- Okay, terrific.

Why don't the three of us
meet at 7?

The... The three of us?

Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't.

Oh, come on, Charlie.
I'm only in town for a few days.

It wouldn't be the same
without you. Right, Alan?

That's... That's true.
It would be different. But still good.

No, no, no. You guys have
a lot of catching up to do.

I insist. Charlie, you have to come.

Well, if it's okay with Alan...

Of course.

Okay, great. Then I will
see you both tomorrow.

- Okay.
- Thank you.

- Can't wait.
- I know. Me too. Good night.

Bye.

So I'll get you something else
for your birthday.

You like hookers?

Charlie, we agreed you're out.
Now stay out.

- All right, fine. I won't go.
- Thank you.

Wait! If you don't come,
she'll think I told you not to come.

There is that possibility.

That's your plan. To make me
look petty and insecure.

Alan, I don't have to plan for that.

Let me tell you something. You're coming
with us, whether you like it or not.

All right.

Wait!

- We should take your new Mercedes.
- Fine.

- I should drive it so she thinks it's mine.
- Okay.

Wait!

She'll never believe
I drive a Mercedes.

You'll drive my old Volvo
so that she thinks it's yours.

Whatever. That just means you'll
be sitting in the backseat alone.

Wait!

Charlie, I can't believe that after
all these years, you're still single.

Well...

It's not that hard to believe.

I'm a selfish, promiscuous,
commitment-phobic man.

Alan, on the other hand, is a very
generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy.

Guilty.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

Now, what is surprising...

...is to hear a man be so honest
and forthcoming about his flaws.

Charlie, you are
a real breath of fresh air.

Guilty.

But if you really want a breath
of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan.

He is a true gentleman.

Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman.

I remember one time we were kids. We
were in my bedroom playing Stratego...

...and my blouse came unbuttoned,
and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek...

...like a lot of guys would do, averted
his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom."

Really. Is that true, Alan?

Pretty much. We were
playing Boggle, not Stratego.

Well, there you go.
A gentleman. A better man than I.

Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie.
You seem like a wonderful man to me.

Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better.

Excuse me.

I'll be right back.
I think he wants to talk.

You know, you are such
a good brother.

You have no idea.

"Bosom"?

Forget that.
What the hell are you doing?

What? I'm trying to make you look
good. Turns out it's not that easy.

You look like you're trying
to make me look good...

...but you're making you look good.

I don't know how,
but that's the net result.

- Alan, you're being ridiculous.
- Am I? I think not.

From the minute we walked in,
you've been sabotaging me.

- How?
- How? Look at where I'm sitting.

- What? You wanted to sit next to her.
- Yeah, and you let me.

And now you get to stare into her eyes,
and I get to stare into her ear.

What do you want from me?
Wanna change seats?

Sure. That won't look suspicious.

I'm just trying to help, Alan.
Well, how about that? I do have to pee.

You wanna help me?
Stop talking me up.

- It's killing me.
- Okay.

Stop putting yourself down.
That's killing me too.

- Got it.
- Just sit there and eat your dinner...

...and I'll play your game.

Fine.

You wanna shake on it?

You're disgusting.

Yeah, I'm disgusting.

At least I'm not the one
taking a squirt on my shoe.

Let me tell you something
about my brother.

He puts himself down,
but he is truly a wonderful man.

I mean, here's a guy,
single, good-Iooking, talented...

- Well, l...
- You're too modest.

Talented, a ton of money.

And what does he do when his brother
and nephew need a place to live?

Does he complain about us
cramping his style? No.

He opens up his home, and his heart.

And frankly, I don't know
which one is bigger.

You are an incredible human being.

Can we get the damn check, please?

Wait till you meet Jake.
He's a great kid.

You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie?

Don't oversell him, Alan.
He mostly sits around and eats.

What do you guys like to do together?

Oh, we do all kinds
of father-son things.

- We go to the movies...
- Where he sits and eats.

And we also build models...

You know, airplanes, and
fly them off the deck.

- That sounds like fun.
- Oh, it is. Jake loves it.

I mean, he is a great kid.

I can't wait to meet him.

How about tomorrow afternoon?

- Tomorrow sounds great.
- Good, good. It's a date.

- So don't be late.
- Or we'll have to wait.

Oh, okay. Here we are.

Thank you so much.
I had a wonderful time.

- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

Good night, Charlie.

Good night.

To the Batcave, Alfred.

Go to hell.

I was just sitting here.
I didn't put her tongue in my mouth.

You got tongue?

Actually, looking back,
it was probably mine.

Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you.

Besides, you're the one
who got the date.

You had to pimp your kid
out to do it, but you got there.

Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong
with bragging on my son.

He's a reflection of me,
and if that compensates...

...for some of my social clumsiness...

And maybe rustles up a little tail.

I am not pimping him out.

Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you.

Thank you. And make yourself
scarce tomorrow.

- I don't need any more of your help.
- Fine. You're on your own.

Now, hush up and drive
Miss Daisy home.

Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go?

I guess.

See how he loves this?

Pilot to copilot. Contact.

What?

- Contact.
- Why are you talking like that?

Just... Just start the engine.

Here we go. Ready for liftoff?

It's not a rocket ship, Dad.

I know that, Jake.

Hey, it actually works.

Bring it up. Bring it up.

- Okay.
- Come on, Jake, up, up. It's...

- Don't yell.
- Give me that.

- No, I'm doing it.
- Well, then do it.

I am.

Is that it?

No, go get it, and we'll patch
her back up, like we always do.

Can we just order
a pizza and watch TV?

Go get the plane.

This sucks.

"This sucks." Isn't he a hoot?

He's great.

So...

...here we are.

Yep.

I just cannot get over
how much you've changed.

- You like?
- Yeah, me like. I mean... I mean, I like.

So...

...where's Charlie?

This is all I could find.

- Guess who that is.
- No way.

- Way.
- What was going on with your hair?

It's called a Jeri curl.

It was my Michael Jackson period.

Who's the tall guy next to you?

Oh, that's me, Jake.

Oh, sorry.

Well, at least you look like a girl now.

Thank you.

Was Dad your boyfriend?

Oh, no, no.
Jamie and I were just friends.

Yeah, we were never that way.

Are you that way now?

- Why don't you go watch TV?
- Finally.

You know, Jamie, I've been thinking.

You're single. I'm single.
Well, we have an awful lot in common.

I mean, there's no reason
we couldn't try to be...

...you know, more than friends.

Is that something you'd want?

Well...

- Hey.
- Oh, darn.

- Sorry to intrude.
- That's okay. It's good to see you.

I thought you were gonna be busy.

I was. I went to a movie,
shot some pool...

...bought a book, bought a shirt, drank
a bucket of coffee, read the book.

And then it occurred to me:
"Hey, I have a home."

Hey, Dad, can you microwave
some popcorn for me?

- Why can't you make it for yourself?
- Remember what happened last time?

You're old enough to make
popcorn without starting a fire.

Okay, I'll give it a shot.

I'll be right back.

So Jake's a great kid, isn't he?

Yeah, I suppose.

I would never say this to Alan, but I
don't really care much for children.

Well, the truth is, Alan's
not too fond of him either.

He feeds the kid and keeps
a roof over his head...

...but there's no
love lost between them.

- Charlie, give it a rest.
- Sorry?

Why do you push me towards Alan...

...when it's obvious
how much you want me?

He's got a birthday coming up.

Just tell me you want me.

Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her.

What? No, no. You two, with the
Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle.

You should be together.

Clearly she wants you, so let's be
grown-up, and I'll get out of the way...

...so the two pretty people can mate.

No, no, no, no.
You laid the foundation...

...and you should, you know,
lay the rest of it.

I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I am stepping aside...

- No, no. I'm stepping aside.
- No, no. I am.

No, no, I'll step aside.
I will clear the way.

Will you both just shut up?
You're ruining everything.

- Nice going.
- Nice going.

- Say it, Charlie.
- Say what?

Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harper
finally wants Eckelberry Hound.

- You knew about that name?
- That name scarred me for life.

It's the reason I haven't eaten
a carbohydrate since college.

- Well, you do look good.
- You're damn right I look good...

...you smug, shallow son of a bitch.

I have spent years working
and sweating and dreaming...

...about the day that I would be
able to rub your smarmy nose in it.

Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

This is the signal, Charlie:
You can't have this.

Not now, not ever.
Never, never, never!

You know, I didn't make up
the Eckelberry Hound thing.

But he did spread it around.
I was always your friend.

Oh, please. I spent years
throwing myself at you, friend.

Playing stupid nerd games
on my bed with my shirt open, buddy.

Hoping that you would
kiss me or touch me...

...or at least notice me
as a woman, pal!

- You knew your shirt was open?
- Who do you think opened it?

But I wasn't pretty enough for you.
You wanted Donna DeMarco...

...or Maxine Chernikoff,
just because they had big boobs...

...and no excess facial hair.

Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco,
old Double D.

Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry.

But I was a stupid teenager.
I guess I just didn't appreciate you then.

I guess not.

But that was a long time ago.
I'm not a stupid teenager anymore.

Do you think maybe you could forgive
me, and maybe we could try again?

Is that what you really want, Alan?

Very much.

Well, eat your heart out.

You can never have this.
Never, never, never!

Well, I guess we know
why she's still single.

You're right, Dad. This is fun.

Told you. It just takes a little
while to get the hang of it.

See if I can bring it in for a landing.

Probably not a good idea.
There's no real place to put it.

What do you think Donna DeMarco's
doing these days?

.......... ********** ..........

Crap.

Oopsie.

Oh, Charlie!

Okay, I guess I'll give you a call.

Alrighty, that'd be great.

Sounds good. Looking forward to it.

Bye-bye now.

Swell.

Hey, Alan. You know how to say:

"Please go faster," in Polish?

- Funny language, isn't it?
- Yeah, hilarious.

The earthquake hit Sherman Oaks
a lot harder than Malibu.

- What earthquake?
- What earthquake?

About an hour ago.
You didn't feel the house shaking?

Unbelievable.
You actually thought that was you?

No, I thought it was her,
you know, because of me.

The good news is,
unless they report it on Polish TV...

...I still get the credit.

I'm thrilled for you.
Anyway, Judith called.

A pipe broke,
soaked her living room carpet...

...and she's completely freaking out.

Yeah, well, that's the difference
between wife and ex-wife.

With ex-wife, you don't even have to
pretend to care.

Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous.

Have you even tried?

She's the mother of my son.
I'm concerned about her welfare.

I told her she could stay here
until repairs.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up. Back up.

When you told her, did you have, like,
a sarcastic chuckle in your voice?

Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith,
you can stay here."

- It's just for a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

Jack The Ripper just killed
a couple of prostitutes.

It was still wrong.

- Do you want me to put her in a hotel?
- Yeah, put her in a hotel.

Put her in a space capsule. Put her
in a catapult and see how far she flies.

Charlie, I can't do that to her.

Again, have you even tried?

- She's afraid of another quake.
- Well, what about what I'm afraid of?

- What are you afraid of?
- Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs.

Unplanned pregnancies.
And your ex-wife living in my house.

Come on, Charlie.
She's just a small, frightened woman.

There are no small, frightened women.
That's a myth.

Perpetrated by the large, angry
women who secretly run the world.

I think it would be healthy for Jake
to see his mother and father...

...living together as friends.

Oh, Alan, grow up.

As long as he's got pizza with cheese
and TV with 150 channels...

...he doesn't give a rat's ass
what you guys do.

Now that I think about it, neither do I.

That had better be a big,
pregnant bird covered with spiders.

- I don't know how to thank you.
- I'm glad you're okay.

Charlie, I know this is a big imposition.
I really appreciate you inviting me.

I thought she should know
this was your idea.

Actually, I had several other ideas.
Wanna hear them?

Tell Jake you're here.
I'll take your bags.

Thank you, Alan. Thank you both.

I promise I'll be out of here
in a couple of days.

- Judith, sit down. I've got it covered.
- No. I can pitch in.

Where do you keep the salad tongs?
Wait, I got them.

- Better use the wooden ones.
- What's wrong with these?

I use those whenever I drop my watch
in the toilet.

This is a regular occurrence?

- You'd think I'd learn.
- And you keep them in the kitchen?

I used to hang them in the bathroom,
but it freaked some chicks out.

He's just kidding with you.
Use the wooden ones.

I don't want any salad.

- Well, you have to have some.
- Dad doesn't make me have salad.

Alan?

He's exaggerating.
We have salad all the time.

I just don't eat it.

It's kind of our compromise.

Okay. Fine.
Your house, your rules.

Technically, it's my house, his rules.

Of course.
Just have a little salad.

So I spoke with
the plumbing company...

...and they'll be there in the morning.

So I'll drop off Jake
and meet them on my way to work.

- Thank you, Alan.
- You're welcome.

This is really weird.

Why? Your mom and I may not be living
together anymore, but we're still friends.

I don't flip off my friends
when I talk to them on the phone.

Nice shooting.

Two with one bullet.

Well, if either of us did,
in fact, do that, it was wrong.

The important thing is we're making
an effort to be nicer to each other.

That's right. And your mom staying here
is a good example of that.

Very nicely put, Alan.

If we leave now,
we can be in Mexico in two hours.

Hey.

Hey.

- Where's Alan?
- Don't know.

Mind if I join you?

Sure.

Thanks again for your hospitality.

Don't mention it.

You know, the TV in your room works.

Oh, okay. Good to know.

I just tucked Jake in.
He loves you very much.

Yeah. I love him too.

You got cable, satellite, DVD.
The whole shebang.

Great.

I'm surprised you're home
on a Saturday night.

What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle.

Well, I got laid this morning.

So I thought I'd kick back tonight.

Oh, my. Well, isn't that something.

- Nice girl?
- I guess.

She doesn't speak English.

Well, hey.
What are you guys doing?

Just watching a little TV.

- What's on?
- I don't know. I just sat down.

Oh, we've seen this movie before.

- No, we didn't.
- Sure we have.

That guy's girlfriend
turns out to be the murderer.

Really? I did not know that.

Oh, right. And she's not really a girl.

I did not know that either.

- When did we see this?
- The first movie after Jake was born.

Oh, right.

It was so hard to leave him
with the sitter.

As soon as we got to the door,
the sobbing started.

Yeah, well, it was hard for me.

You were such a softy.

Alcohol.

While you're up,
you wanna make popcorn?

- Sure.
- No butter for me.

Got it.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rose.

Anybody here?

Good.

Jeez.

- I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
- That's all right. Relax.

- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

- Where's Alan?
- He took Jake to school...

...then went to meet with the plumber.
- Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it.

Charlie, wait.

This is your home. Sit down.
Drink your coffee.

Okay.

Oh, and I'm white trash.

What are you, a farm animal?

- What?
- That's your brother's ex-wife out there.

I know who she is.

Oh, no, no. She's just staying here
because of the earthquake.

I'm not. I would never. I couldn't.

Okay, I could. But I'm not.

Yeah. That's what I used to stay
about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey.

How's it going?
Used to having your mom here?

Nope. You?

I'm still thinking Mexico.

I liked it better
when they weren't talking.

Can't get away with much
when they compare notes.

It's hell.

Jake, your mom wants to say
goodbye.

- She's leaving?
- Just for a little while.

- Where's she going?
- Just out to dinner.

You know, with a friend.
I guess it's a date of some sort.

She's going on a date?

Of some sort.

- And you're okay with this?
- Oh, yeah.

We talked about it. I think it's a sign
of maturity that our relationship...

...has evolved enough that we can be
honest that we see other people.

Yeah, except the people you're seeing
are in magazines and videos.

Hey, I told you
to stay out of my room.

And that's not the point.
If I were dating...

...she'd be just as supportive
of me as I am of her.

We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife.
We are friends getting on with our lives.

She's happy and I'm happy.

- Okay. I'm leaving.
- Oh, have fun.

Wow, I'm impressed.

What happened to my jealous,
tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother?

Oh, there he is.

Well, well, well.

- Alan?
- Oh, you remember me?

What are you doing up so late?

That's funny, I was about
to ask you the same thing.

Don't tell me you were
waiting up for me?

This isn't about
what I was doing, Judith.

No, no.

This is about
what you were doing until...

...now.

I told you I had a date.
You said you were fine with it.

In theory, I was. In practice,
I think we can both see I'm not.

What did you want me to do,
sit here and do nothing?

Why not?
It was good enough for me.

You know what,
you haven't changed at all.

You're still the same neurotic,
overbearing, control freak I threw out.

Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps.
But you know what?

You're not gonna throw me out,
because I have changed.

Tonight, I'm leaving you.

As it turns out,
a distinction without a difference.

Fine, Alan. Suit yourself.

Where's Dad?

- He's at our house.
- How come?

Well, we decided we needed
a little time apart.

Isn't that why you got a divorce?

It's hard to explain, Jake.

- Do I get any presents this time?
- No.

What happens now?
You gonna live here?

- No.
- Are you gonna buy a new house?

No.

Wanna go to Mexico
with me and Uncle Charlie?

- Good morning.
- Good morning.

Where's Alan?

- Well, it's a long story.
- You're not gonna believe it.

Hi. I just stopped by
to say I told you so.

I told you so.

Oh, come on, Alan. If you can't
laugh at yourself, at least let me do it.

What do you want, Charlie?

Well...

...first of all, I'd like to know
exactly how you managed...

...to let your ex-wife
throw you out of my house.

Because that's the first thing people
are gonna ask when I tell this story.

She didn't throw me out, I left.

Oh, good, there's a twist. You see,
that's what makes a good story.

- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- Oh, lighten up.

You tried to be friends with the woman
who wrecked your life and failed.

No damage done.
Just a little personal humiliation...

...and at this point in your life,
how would you even notice that?

- Are you finished?
- Did I mention I told you so?

- Twice.
- Counting this one?

- Okay, I'm finished.
- Thank you.

Now, on to new business.

Currently, you and I are sitting in a
house that belongs to neither one of us.

While your ex-wife is sitting
in the house that belongs to me.

- You see the paradox?
- I can't go back there, Charlie.

She's running around, having
a great time, and I've got nothing.

- You've got me.
- Drop dead.

Okay, now you got nothing.

It would be different
if Judith and I were both dating.

True, but moot.

- Unless...
- What unless?

- It's stupid.
- Stupider than this?

Come on. What do you got?

Well, what if you were dating?

- But I'm not.
- But if you looked like you were?

Oh, you mean? No, no way.

I'm not gonna let you fix me up
with one of your bimbo girlfriends.

Okay, forget it.

She'd have to be really pretty.

Like a 10. And young. Like a 20.

- Anything else?
- And smart.

And a sense of humor is important.
Well-read, good with kids...

...non-smoking, of course.
Oh, and easy on the piercings.

Nothing south of the equator.

You're mighty picky for a guy with
an adult newsstand in his sock drawer.

Okay. Homework is taken care of.
He's taking a shower.

You may wanna check in on him,
make sure he's not goofing around.

- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have dinner plans.

- Really?
- Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?

- I didn't say that, I'm happy for you.
- Well, thank you.

Again, I'm sorry I overreacted
the other night.

I want us to have the kind of friendship
that can be mutually supportive.

- Me too.
- You'll go out, I'll go out.

Right. So is this someone
you've been seeing for a while?

Yeah, a while.
But, you know, not exclusive.

I don't wanna get tied down.

Oh, that must be Camille.

- She picks you up?
- Well, what can I say?

It's a new world, Judith.

Hey, wow.

You are so good for my ego.

- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Camille.

- Hello, I'm Judith.
- You're Alan's ex?

Wow, I didn't expect
you to be so young looking.

- Thank you.
- I mean, you have such beautiful skin...

...for the mother of an 11 -year-old.

Oh, thank you.

Okay. Well, we should get going.

It was nice meeting you.

I just hope I look half as good as her
when I'm that old.

I'm betting you will.

Man, I don't know how he does it.

I made a big play for her, nothing.

- She's so young.
- Yeah, some guys like that.

I gotta hand it to you, Judith.

You were very mature.

I guess that's because
you're a very mature woman.

Yeah, thanks.
Jake, say goodbye to Mommy!

She's going home!

- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

Sounds like somebody cracked open
the sock drawer last night.

I'm going to ignore that because I am
in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you.

Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrier
on her way out was thanks enough.

I don't even care about that anymore.
That was the best date of my life.

I mean, Camille is smart and funny.
And, oh, boy, talk about pretty.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet she
rocked your world in the sack, huh?

What? No, no. Get your mind out
of the gutter. We just talked all night...

...and then there was a little kissing.
Maybe on our next date, who knows?

But for now,
I'm just gonna play it slow.

- You're playing it slow?
- Yeah.

I don't know where you found Camille,
but she's a bit old-fashioned.

She's not like the ones
you usually go out with.

No, I guess not.

A thousand dollars a night
and he's playing it slow.

You're a good brother, Charlie.

He's playing it slow.

She demanded cash.

He's playing it slow.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

- Ready for a fun weekend?
- He's not gonna have a fun weekend.

Charlie, he's gonna study
for a history test on Monday.

Well, if believing that gets you back
in your car, I'll play along.

- Where's Alan?
- He's not here.

Really? I told him I was on my way.

That might be why he's not here.

Okay, I'll just have to go
over everything with you.

I'm gonna visit my parents.

I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday.
Alan has to take him to school.

Monday is soccer practice.

He has his math tutor
and his guitar teacher on Tuesday...

Hang on. Hang on.

Oh, hi, Judith.

Alan, why are you avoiding me?

- I'm not avoiding you as much as...
- Hiding.

- Thank you.
- Why were you hiding?

Why does the wounded gazelle
hide from the stealthy jaguar?

Why does the helpless piglet
hide from ravenous wolverine?

Animal Planet.

You learn a lot.

We need to talk
about your pain-in-the-ass mother.

You know, I would love to...

...but as Charlie told you, I'm not here.
- I let her take Jake out to dinner.

She brought him home and she lectured
me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears.

- Fifteen minutes, huh?
- How long is this gonna take?

Like I'm a bad parent.

Let her try and get a Q-Tip
in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear.

Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips.
She had a squirt gun.

You know, the woolly meerkat
of western Africa...

...buries her cubs up to their necks
and licks their ears clean.

What? It seemed apropos.

If she wants to spend time
with her grandson...

...she needs to back off.
- Okay, I'll tell her.

- Thank you.
- I'll tell Alan you stopped by.

Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

- I don't remember.
- You just read that chapter.

Yeah, but Lewis and Clark
was a long time ago.

Thanks for the ride, Sally.

And for getting me home too.

- Why is that funny?
- It's not.

Mustang Sally, giddyup.

Now, Lewis and Clark.

Face it, Dad,
I'm just not good at history.

Really? What did you have
for lunch yesterday?

A pizza square. Actually, two
pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich...

...and a bag of Skittles.
- Okay, see, that's history.

And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer.

- Great.
- Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong.

- It was a Ho Ho.
- Got it.

You know what I like?
Those big, pink things with coconut.

- Snow Balls?
- Exactly. Can you still get those?

Yeah, but not at the supermarket.
You have to go to 7-Eleven.

Thank you.

Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

No, we are trying to study.

All right, I'll hoof it.

- Can I bring you back something?
- Ding Dong.

Who's there?

I'm trying to get him ready for his test.

Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead.
I'll pretend I'm not here.

Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

Louisiana Purchase.

- Right.
- I knew that.

Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first.

And I'm still buzzed.

- Okay, give me another question.
- All right.

Seward's Folly
is another name for?

- Jake?
- Alaska.

- Very good.
- Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward.

Okay, the score is 1 to 1.

Now that you mention it...

...an Eskimo Pie would go down
pretty good right now.

Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

No, next question:

- The War of 1812...
- 1812.

- No.
- 1813.

Let me finish the question.

The War of 1812 was fought
against whom?

- The British.
- Very good, 2 to 1, Jake.

- Yes.
- No fair. My buzzer's broken.

- Next question.
- Let me try yours.

See? His works.

All right, contestants,
we are at the final round.

The questions are worth more.

- And the answers are harder.
- True.

- Wait for a question.
- Okay.

Here we go. Name three changes
in American life...

...brought about
by the industrial revolution.

Populations shift to cities, employment
moving from farms to factories, and...

- Yes?
- Sorry, I hit it by mistake.

- Settlement of the West.
- That's correct.

- You are our new champion.
- Yes.

Settlement of the West.

- You see, Jake? You know this stuff.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

- Trust me, you are gonna do great.
- Yeah, thanks, Dad.

You're welcome.
Now go get ready for bed.

- I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in.
- Okey-dokey.

Oh, I gotta get a security camera.

Where's your brother?
I wanna talk to him.

- He's not here.
- Oh, really?

No, he's actually not here.

You know what his ex-wife
said to me?

Mom, please go away.

She never calls me "Mom,"
but that was the gist of it.

I took Jake out to dinner...

- You're pretending not to understand me.
- Right.

And all I did was suggest to Judith...

...that she might wanna pay a little more
attention to her son's ear hygiene.

Not only was she completely
unappreciative...

...but she had the nerve to denigrate
how I raised my sons.

Yeah, because we turned out so well.

Excuse me, but whatever
emotional issues you think you have...

...I kept your ears spotless.

I remember.
You used the same Super Soaker...

...to keep us off the furniture.

Ladies and gentlemen...

...presenting noted scholar
and A-student, Jake Harper.

- You got an A?
- I got an A.

- All right. Way to go.
- Congratulations, Jake.

- Thanks. It's my first A this year.
- Really? Well, it's none too soon then.

- Mom, leave it alone.
- I'm not saying anything.

I think it's wonderful.
Did anybody else in your class get an A?

Almost everybody. Why?

Oh, I was just curious
as to how hard the test was.

It doesn't matter, Mom.
Still an A.

An A is very nice. I just don't know
why you're making such a big fuss...

...if they're just handing them out
like rubella vaccinations.

I don't know.
It looks like a pretty hard test to me.

- No, it was easy.
- That's because you studied.

- You earned that A.
- Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

You hear that?
Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

Wendy Chow is a freak of nature.

She cloned a goldfish
for the science fair.

We can't compare Jake to her.

Who should we compare him to then?
The paste eaters and the unibrows?

Darling, if you set the bar
low in childhood...

...he may never reach
the heights he's capable of.

You're condemning him
to a life of failure and mediocrity.

Is that what you want, Jake?
A life of failure and mediocrity?

No.

You see? He may well be sharper
than you give him credit for.

I'm gonna go to my room.

I am putting that A-paper
up on the fridge.

Wow. Texas used to be
a separate country.

Why did we change that?

Not now, Charlie.
How dare you?

- Excuse me?
- He worked hard on that test.

He was finally feeling good
about himself and his abilities...

...and in 30 seconds
you managed to suck...

...every bit of self-esteem out of him.
You're like a...

- A self-esteem sucker.
- Yes, exactly.

Alan, I was just having
a conversation with the boy.

No. No, you don't
have conversations. You...

Suck self-esteem.

I would've gotten it.

Mom, I am sorry, but I don't think
I want you around my son anymore.

- What?
- You heard me.

You will not do to him...

...what you did to me and Charlie.
- What did I do to you?

What did you do? What did she...?
Charlie, tell her.

Why tell her when we can show her?

I see. So you're both
turning against me.

Oh, I turned a long time ago.

Alan's just catching up.

All right, fine.

If I'm not welcome here...

...I'll leave.

My own sons are throwing me out.

Goodbye.

This isn't over, is it?

No, we're screwed.

Let me guess. Mom?

She's been calling all morning.
I'm starting to feel guilty.

You can't show weakness, Alan.
She'll sense it.

Like the hooded cobra senses
the rapid heartbeat...

...of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat.

But don't you feel
even a bit sorry for her?

Does the mongoose feel sorry
for the wounded garden-snake?

Does the dingo feel sorry
for the slow-crawling Australian baby?

- You guys okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

We're fine. Why?

Your mother just called me. She said
she's been trying to reach you...

...all morning
and she's very worried.

- We're fine, Rose.
- We're not talking to her.

Why? Because she tried to encourage
Jake to live up to his potential?

That's a reason to throw her out
and slam the door in her face?

How could you be so cruel
to your own mother?

And the dingo has found
another Australian baby.

Rose, that's not what happened.

We were protecting Jake.

How? By ripping his only grandmother
out of his life?

- He has another grandmother.
- Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak.

Is that what she told you?

For the record,
Jake's other grandmother...

...is out of rehab and doing just fine.

We appreciate your concern, Rose.
Thanks for stopping by.

So now you're just gonna
slam the door in my face?

Pretty much.

Not as satisfying with a glass door.

Okay, first she starts
with the phone calls...

...then she sent Rose over.
I wonder what's next.

I don't know, but I'm betting
it'll be something big.

Right. I understand, it's terrible.

Okay, let me see
what I can do about it.

How in the hell did your mother
get my cell phone number?

Sometimes,
when the nest is threatened...

... the seemingly docile creatures have
been known to eat their own young.

Hey, did Mom call you
at the office today?

No, she call here?

- No, it's been pretty quiet.
- Yeah, maybe too quiet.

And here we see
the female praying-mantis...

... after copulation,
devouring her mate.

Your ex-wife back from her parents'?

Yeah, I dropped Jake off
with her this afternoon.

Apparently her mom had
a little relapse with the pills.

- Oh, yeah?
- They found her in pajamas...

...driving an imaginary car through the
home and garden section of Wal-Mart.

How could they tell
if she was driving an imaginary car?

She rolled down the window
to ask for directions to the pharmacy.

- Here we witness the...
- Not Mom.

Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper.

What? I see.

Okay, then.
Thanks for letting me know.

- Who was that?
- St. John's Hospital.

Our mother checked in this evening with
chest pains and breathing difficulties.

- Oh, my God.
- Ever wonder who was the first guy...

...to put pineapple on pizza?

I bet he was gay.

- Charlie...
- No straight guy is gonna say:

"You know what this pizza could use?
A pineapple ring."

God bless him. It's good.

Charlie, is Mom okay?

Of course she's okay. She's faking.

- How can you be so sure?
- It really doesn't make any difference.

If she is faking and
we rush to see her, she wins.

If she's not faking,
and we ignore her...

...she complains
about what horrible sons we are...

...and she still wins.

What if she's not faking and she dies?

Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full.

I can't help thinking this is all my fault.

I told Mom she couldn't see
her grandson and she had a heart attack.

Alan, you forget
who you're dealing with.

This woman buried two husbands
and divorced two others.

She's lived through wars,
riots, earthquakes.

Only way you're gonna bring her down
is with a stake dipped in holy water.

Here we are.

Oh, my God. Mommy?

Excuse me?

- Are you family?
- Yeah, we're her sons.

Is she gonna be okay?
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

Your mother's gonna be fine.
I can't find a thing wrong with her.

- Are you sure?
- As sure as I can be.

Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine.

Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal.

- Oh, thank God.
- That bitch.

Yeah, tell me about it.

Excuse me.
I'm gonna tell her she can go home.

- Oh, no, please, let us.
- Yeah, we owe her that.

Suit yourself.
Oh, better hurry, though.

The nurses are circulating
a"do not revive" petition.

- You said there was nothing wrong.
- It's a big hospital.

Things happen.

What do we do now?

Don't worry. I got a plan.

Oh, great, he has a plan.

Mom?

Charlie? Is that you?

Alan's here too, Mom.

- Hi, Mom.
- Boys, you didn't have to come.

Are you kidding? Of course we did.

- Right, Alan?
- Of course.

Tell us what happened.

I came home this afternoon, alone.

I was walking up the stairs...

...alone.

And I had trouble breathing...

...so I drove myself to the hospital...

...alone.

- Well, why did you drive yourself?
- Oh, I didn't wanna bother...

...the ambulance people.

Why didn't you call us?

Oh, you both made it very clear
how you feel about me.

Now, that's not fair.

Just tell Jake...

...his Grandmommy loves him
very much.

Don't talk like that.

You can tell him yourself,
after the operation.

What operation?

Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasses
are routine these days.

- Quadruple?
- Yeah, yeah.

You got four clogged arteries.
Right, Alan?

Right, the doctor said it's lucky
you came when you did.

Another few days and you'd have been
flopping around on the floor like a carp.

It's no big deal, Mom.
They crack open you open...

...flush out the pipes, sew you back up
and you're good as new.

Except, you know, for the big,
gnarly scar on your chest.

They're prepping the OR.

We got the best surgeon available.

He's young but really sharp.

And well-respected in his own country.

Well, all right.

If it has to be done, it has to be done.

I love you, boys.

If the worst should happen...

...please remember that.

- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

Oh, my God, Evelyn
Are you all right?

Oh, Judith, is that you?

Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too.

Oh, Jake.
Come to Grandmommy, darling.

I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma.

Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much better
now that her little man is here.

- I made you a get-well card.
- Oh, isn't that nice.

Gift shop wasn't open?

You said you had a plan.
Well, guess what? It was a bad plan.

- Alan, calm down.
- The plan sucked.

- Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

She's expecting a quadruple bypass.
What are we gonna do?

We're gonna get her one.

Must be someone around here
who can handle a rib spreader.

- Charlie, that's insane.
- You're right.

There's no time. Better scrub up.

She had to drive herself to the hospital?
What is wrong with you two?

- Relax, Judith. She's not sick.
- What?

She's faking and we called her bluff,
and then she called ours.

So now, we're gonna
have to cut her open.

You want in?

Hey, guess what?
After Grandma's operation...

...she's gonna take me
to Magic Mountain, okay?

Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
We're gonna have to tell her.

You sure?
We don't need to do the bypass.

All we do is put her out,
slice her open.

- The scar will sell it.
- The truth, Charlie.

Doesn't have to be a big scar.

Okay, doctor, let's schedule
this as quickly as possible.

Oh, great. I'll be here.

Hello, boys.

- What are you doing?
- Lf I'm going to have to have surgery...

...I want my own doctor.

Mom, you don't really need a surgeon.

Oh, but I do.

Your quadruple bypass story
makes the perfect cover...

...for a little nip tuck.

No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right?

About Jake. I told him
I'd take him to Magic Mountain...

...but you know
how I feel about direct sunlight.

Yeah, and wolfbane.

You'll take him for me,
won't you, Charlie?

- Sure, Mom.
- I'll make it up to him...

...by taking him out for a haircut
and some decent clothes.

- He'll like that.
- Sure, Mom.

Maybe when his mother sees
how nice he could look...

...she'll take the hint and stop dressing
him like a tackling dummy.

Oh, the food here is just dreadful.

So why don't you boys
run across the street...

...and get me a nice ahi tuna...

Charlie, what in God's name
are you doing?

Just practicing.

The worker bees, or drones...

... live a life of utter devotion
to their queen.

You had a plan.

From birth, these industrious
yet mindless creatures...

... slave away to fulfill
the queen 's every need.

"Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan."

Until finally they reach the end
of their brief lifespan and die...

... becoming food and building materials
for the rest of the hive.

Alan, where's my sandwich?

Coming, Mom.

A cruel existence? Perhaps.
But that's life on the Animal Planet.

.......... ********** ..........

Well, this is gonna be
a sucky weekend.

Try spending it with an 11 -year-old
who does nothing but complain.

You mean me?

Boy, no wonder they got to
write your name in your underwear.

What am I supposed to do?

- Watch TV.
- There's nothing on.

- Play a video game.
- I've played them all.

- Read a book.
- Yeah, right.

Who's the moron now?

Okay. Here's a rainy day activity.

There are 12 college basketball games on
this weekend.

Dial this number, and ask for Coop.

Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingles
and write down everything he tells you.

Do I get to make
some picks this time?

- You got money?
- Lf you pay me what you owe me.

Well, you're getting an education here.
That's priceless.

- What's going on?
- Just talking about picking colleges.

- I like Duke.
- Over Wake Forest?

Got a hunch.

You've got him thinking about college?

You're welcome.
So how'd it go at the doctor?

Sit down,
I have to tell you something.

What?

The doctor wants me
to have a procedure.

- What kind of procedure?
- He says I'm fine...

...and it's routine,
but I'm really freaked out about it.

What procedure?

A colonoscopy.

Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal.

They're just gonna shove
a camera up your ass.

Okay, in all future references
to this procedure...

...can we please use
the word "glide" or "slide"...

...as opposed to "shove."

Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually
has to get one of those.

- It's strictly a fact-finding mission.
- You've had one?

No, you crazy?

But I hear there's nothing
to worry about. It's a tiny little camera.

In the old days, they'd send
a sketch artist up there.

Besides, you're unconscious.

That's what I'm worried about.
I'll be in a very vulnerable position.

- They could do anything.
- Alan, it's not a pirate ship.

Just relax.
It'll be over before you know it.

Yeah. I'll bet that's what they say
on pirate ships.

- Damn it.
- What?

The sink's stopped up again.

That kid doesn't know the difference
between the garbage and the drain.

- What do you want? He's 11.
- That's no excuse.

If he can't tell which hole is which
at his age, he's headed for trouble.

How about that?

Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares.

Pirate ships?

Full-service gas stations.

I fail to see the connection.

Cold steel nozzles
going into openings.

Dipsticks being pulled out.

Do I have to draw you a picture?

You know what?

You need to get your mind off
this colonoscopy.

Come on! Get in there, you sucker!

Easy for you to say.

How about this?

How about we hop in the car
and go to Vegas for a couple of days?

Just like that? What about Jake?

Oh, yeah, Jake.

Okay, how about this, we get him
a fake mustache and a hat...

...and tell everybody his mother
was a heavy smoker.

- I don't think so.
- We can still bring him...

...come on, it's the perfect solution.
The kid's bored...

...and you're all puckered up
over this colonoscopy thing.

It just won't go in.

- Well, it is a three-day weekend.
- Exactly.

And I got 2 grand in my pocket that's
itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover.

Come on, we can be there
in like four hours.

Unless you drive,
in which case I'm not going.

Perfect, now I can't get it out.

You know what? Why not?
One way or another...

...I'm gonna get reamed.
I might as well enjoy a free buffet.

Great. Go grab a toothbrush
and we'll hit the road.

Pinky? Berta.

Order a keg and call the gang,
I got the house until Tuesday.

Okay, we're gonna need two rooms.

One for Alan Harper and son...

...and one for Charlie Harper and
a cocktail waitress to be named later.

No, I don't want connecting rooms.

Weren't you listening?

In fact, put mine on a different floor.

Come on, let's go.

Now, what's playing
in your showroom?

Nude Legends on Ice. Sweet.

Okay, this may
sound like a dumb question...

...but is it a family show?

Well, what if the kid had a mustache?

All right. He'll just have to stay in
the room and watch scrambled porn.

- You could help me, you know.
- No, you're doing okay.

- Where's your clean underwear?
- I'm wearing it.

- That's all you brought for the weekend?
- It's only three days.

All right, we'll pick some up there.

They'd last five days
if I turn them inside out.

What's going on? Aren't you ready?

- I'm packing Jake.
- For what, college?

- What the hell's this?
- So he can go swimming.

- Where?
- They have pools in Vegas, Charlie.

Why don't you bring a frying pan,
they got kitchens too.

- Let's see. Sport jacket.
- He doesn't need a sport jacket.

What if we take him someplace nice?

Take him someplace nice?

Alan, if I wanna throw away money,
I'll play keno.

- Can I gamble in Vegas?
- No.

- Why am I going?
- Because all the kennels are full.

Now, come on. Let's go.

- Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet.
- What've you been doing?

I changed the phone message...

...to tell people we'd be out of town,
I put together a first aid kit...

...I turned the fridge thermostat down,
because it doesn't have to be cold...

...I called the paper
and stopped delivery...

...and I erased an old Mad Libs book...

...so we'd have something
to entertain us in the car.

- Mad Libs, huh?
- Yeah.

Let me see that.

Go get packed!

Wait until you see Vegas, Jake.

There's action everywhere you look,
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

How does that help me?

I can't gamble,
and I have to be in bed at 9:30.

Hey, when we go to Disneyland
do I complain that I hate...

...every aspect of the entire experience?
- Yeah.

Well, then you know how irritating it is.

- Blackjack.
- That's it?

Yep. You owe me another dollar.

- This stinks.
- You wanna quit?

Just deal the cards.

Attaboy.

Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy?

- Didn't your dad tell you?
- He said it was just a test...

...and it was no big deal,
so I looked it up.

- And?
- I don't believe it.

Believe it.

Wouldn't it be easier to go in
the other way?

- You'd think, but no.
- Why do they have to do it?

- They just wanna see what's going on.
- Did Dad lose something?

Because when I swallowed 35 cents,
we just waited for it to come out.

- No kidding.
- Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back.

Well, the house always takes a cut.

- What're you gonna do?
- Hit me.

Okay, okay.
In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me."

If you want a card, you go like this.

Okay, fine.

- Busted. You owe me another dollar.
- What if I didn't want another card?

You go like this.

That's what I meant to do.

There's no do-overs in Vegas.

What's the signal
to go to the bathroom?

There is no signal,
you just get up and go.

Unless you're on a hot streak,
in which case you sit and wet yourself.

- You're kidding, right?
- You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks...

...and you got $600 on the table,
do the math.

I have to do math and pee my pants?

Alan, are you ready yet?

Just about.

- And where'd I get the $600?
- You've been saying that for 20 minutes.

- What are you doing?
- Financial planning.

I don't wanna look, but I gotta.

In class, if we have to go the bathroom,
we do this or this.

- Get it?
- Yeah. I got it.

Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280.

- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on. Two... Oh, thanks.

Now you made me lose count.

Ten, 10, 10.
Twenty, 20, 20.

Stop it, stop it.
Why are you doing this?

- I have a system.
- Do tell.

I divide my gambling money
into three equal piles.

The first one is for day one.

That I'll put in my money belt.

You're wearing a money belt?

Oh, good, you can't tell.

I was afraid it made me look chunky.

Anyway, the second pile
is for day two. I'll give that to you...

...under no circumstances do you give
it back to me before midnight...

...which would be
the start of day two.

Un-freaking-believable.
What's the last pile for?

That's the most important pile.

That's the money I hide
in my Frye boot.

- In your boot?
- But I pretend that I don't have it...

...so that if disaster strikes
and I've lost piles one and two...

...then I can pull it out,
and poof, I'm solvent again.

- Okay. I think I understand.
- Pretty clever, huh?

Yeah. That's a nice boot.

- Let me see it.
- Oh, sure.

Get dressed and let's go!

Okay.

- Twenty-one!
- Turn over your hole card.

Oh, 27.

Close, 29.

Okay, I'm good.

Alrighty.

Viva Las Vegas.

- Oh, Alan.
- What?

We're going in a Mercedes,
not a time machine.

Should I change?

You should, but after all these years,
I doubt you will.

- What's this?
- Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot.

- Really.
- Yeah, you'll thank me.

Not all hotels supply shower caps
and sewing kits.

Get in the car. Jake, come on.

- Hold on a second.
- Oh, for God's sake. Now what?

Okay, let's go.

- Well, you don't have a fever.
- I told you, he's fine. Let's go.

Charlie, he threw up in
your umbrella stand. Did you miss that?

So? Vegas is full of people
who throw up.

They built that city on a sea of vomit.

- I'm okay, I can go.
- That's the spirit.

You wanna drive five hours with a
puking kid in the back of your Mercedes?

He can stick his head out the window.
Let the guy behind us worry.

- We're not going.
- Oh, come on.

- It's probably just something he ate.
- All right.

What have you eaten
in the last 24 hours?

Well, let's see,
two bowls of Cocoa Puffs...

...a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts,
bag of string cheese.

That reminds me,
we need more string cheese.

Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocket
and a Bagel Bite.

Then dinner, fried chicken, mashed
potatoes and a baloney sandwich.

Okay, it's not what he ate.

Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tang
and some Cheetos.

That explains the orange vomit.

It's probably a stomach virus.

Oh, please. I throw up all the time.

It's just nature's way of saying,
"Everybody out of the pool."

- I'm putting him to bed. Come on.
- They have beds in Vegas.

- What if he needs a doctor?
- They have doctors in Vegas.

I bet if we looked around, we could find
a casino with a hospital theme.

You know, Caesars Sinai
or something.

I'll get it.

Hello? Hey, Mom.

Fine. Nothing.

I threw up in Uncle Charlie's
umbrella stand...

...and we're going to Vegas.
- No!

What kind of a father are you?

I am a good father.
When he threw up, I cancelled the trip.

But you were planning to take
my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas.

It's really a family town now.

The mob hardly has
any influence at all anymore.

Oh, good, Charlie. That helps.

Were you planning on
telling me about this?

What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, Mom.

Oh, good, Jake. That helps.

- Honey, why don't you go lie down.
- Why? I'm fine.

Is it too late to get our bets down
with Coop?

- What bets?
- Who's Coop?

Go lie down. You're delirious.

Listen, Judith, I don't think
you understand what's going on here.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

- You see, this trip was my idea.
- I'm shocked.

Let me finish.

You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up...

Charlie, don't. It's personal.

She has a right to know.

Judith, Alan got some bad news
from the doctor yesterday.

Oh, my God, Alan. What is it?

Well, the doctor says
I have to have a colonoscopy.

- Are you having problems?
- No, it's just routine.

- So?
- So I'm really nervous about it.

That's it?

Well, it's a long, snaky thing
with a camera.

Oh, please. Your son was
10 pounds at birth...

...and his head was
the same size it is now.

That's kind of apples and oranges,
isn't it?

- Goodbye, Alan.
- Wait, wait, wait, Judith.

- Aren't you gonna take Jake with you?
- No, I'm not taking him. He's fine.

Don't think I don't see what's going.
You put Jake up to telling me he's sick...

...so you could pawn him off
while you went to Las Vegas.

He did throw up.
Smell the umbrella stand.

I'm not buying it.
I'll get him Monday night.

And if I find out
you took him to Vegas...

...you'll get a colonoscopy
from my attorney.

I've seen your alimony checks.

You already got one.

So, what's the deal?
Are we going?

- I don't think so.
- Why? I'm fine.

- Yeah, but your mom said, "No."
- Oh, man.

Don't eat anything orange.

- You wanna know what I think?
- Not at all.

I think if she wanted to
keep you on a leash...

...she shouldn't have divorced you.
- I'm not on a leash. I never was.

You were living here
for three weeks...

...before you were getting up
on the couch without permission.

Can we just drop it?
It was a bad idea.

There are no bad ideas. There's just
a lack of will to execute them.

We're men, Alan. Single men.

We go where we want, when we want
and how we want.

Usually without so much toiletries...

...but I'm trying to be flexible here.
- I explained about the toiletries.

The point is, you can't let your ex-wife
control your behavior...

...no matter how stupid
or self-destructive it might be.

- Charlie, l...
- What profit a man...

...if he escapes the iron shackles
of matrimony...

...only to surrender to sexually frustrated
tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife?

You know what? You're right.

- We're men.
- Right, are you with me?

- I'm with you.
- Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas.

- Jake?
- Just a sec.

It's okay. It's mostly water.

I'm fine. Let's go. We're men.

Nope. You're too sick.

Some other time.

I'm really sorry I ruined the trip,
Uncle Charlie.

Hey, it's not your fault.

It's your dad who won't let you go.

- Thanks, Charlie.
- Why should he feel guilty?

Here. Put this on Wake Forest.

Game's over, Jake. They lost.

- What about the spread?
- They didn't cover.

Give me back my money.

Get some rest.

- I'm hungry.
- Get used to it.

- That's some great kid.
- Yeah.

Sick as a dog,
and all he wants is a little action.

Well, he gets that from you.

You think so?

- Because I do try to be a role model.
- I know you do.

Listen, there's no reason
you have to stick around.

He's gonna sleep.
I can keep an eye on him.

No, no, I couldn't go now.

Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas.
You should go.

You're probably gonna have a better time
without Jake and me.

Probably? Unquestionably.

- Then why don't you go?
- I don't know.

It just feels somehow wrong
to abandon the kid when he's sick.

Now you know what it feels like
to be a parent.

How inconvenient.

- What's that?
- It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Berta?

Surprise!

I'm gonna start the IV.

In a few seconds,
you're gonna feel drowsy.

No. No drowsy.
I wanna be out. Completely out.

Don't worry, you will be.

- Right, doctor?
- Aye.

You won't be remembering anything,
me bucko.

Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 grand
for your children's hospital.

And remember, when he wakes up,
you're a gas station attendant.

.......... ********** ..........

Do you just get up in the morning
and figure out ways to make me crazy?

Is that what you do?
You plot it out?

How can I make Alan
miserable today?

How can I reach into his chest...

...rip out his heart, and suck it dry?

- Mom or ex-wife?
- Ex-wife.

- Hi, Judith.
- Charlie says hello.

She says hi.
You're evil and selfish, you know that?

No, no. L... I think that is
a helpful comment.

I pay you alimony and child support
so that you can have a nice house...

...a nice car, every weekend free
because I've got Jake.

And yet you're telling me
you need a vacation?

Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactly
is stressing you out, Judith?

Is it the weekly manicure?
The housekeeper?

- Boob lift.
- The boob lift.

- That you paid for.
- That I paid for.

- And never got to see.
- And never got to see.

No, no, no. You listen to me.

I think you live a damn fine lifestyle...

...that I work 60 hours a week
to support.

So if anybody needs a vacation,
it's not you. It's me!

All right, then.

Goodbye.

Judith's going to Hawaii for a week.

So Jake's staying here.

I'm shocked.

Come on, Jake.
It's time to get up for school.

I can't go to school.

- I'm sick.
- What's wrong?

I think I have acid reflex disease.

Really? Acid reflex disease?

Where does it hurt?

My head?

- Nice try.
- My throat?

Get up.

All right, all right.

I just want you to know,
I'm starting my day really stressed out.

Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me
to send you to Hawaii?

That would be nice.

What's taking you so long?

- I can't find my other shoe.
- So put on a different pair.

But this one's on already.

Hey, what are you doing up so late?

It's 7 a.m.

- What am I doing up so early?
- Where have you been?

Searching the kingdom
for the woman who fits this shoe.

Hey, that's mine. Where was it?

In the driveway.

Oh, yeah!

Okay, let's go.

- Got my lunch?
- Lunch?

- You're supposed to make me lunch.
- Oh, crap.

This isn't helping my stress level.

I forget. Why are you here
in the middle of the week?

- Because my mom's on vacation.
- From what?

Me.

A word of advice: Don't date women
who live near the airport.

It's impossible to sleep in.

I'll try to remember that.

Wish I knew her well enough
to bring her back here.

Well, maybe next time.

Next time?

- My lunch ready?
- It's right here. What are you doing?

- That was for Jake.
- I don't see his name on it.

Okay, fine. You'Il...
You'll have half a sandwich...

...and a banana,
and maybe an orange, and...

...what the hell, an artichoke.

An artichoke?

Maybe you can trade it
for something good.

With who? One of the slow kids?

Give it a shot. Tell him it's a puppy.

Come on, let's go.

I forgot. I have to write five insightful
questions I'd ask George Washington.

What? Last night
you said you had no homework.

Dad, I just said I forgot.

- Okay, fine. You'll do it in the car.
- I was planning on doing math in the car.

President Washington.

Question number one:

"Have you ever thought of coming
back from the dead as a zombie?"

Jake, I don't think that's
what your teacher had in mind.

Do you wanna do it?

No, no. You're doing fine.

Question two:

"Can you eat human flesh
with wooden teeth?"

Hi, Lorraine. I'm running a little late.

Could you move my 9:30 to 10,
my 10 to 10:30...

...and, well,
you see where this is going.

You don't?

Hang on, I've got somebody
on the other line.

Hello.

Oh, hi, Mom. Look, I can't talk
right now. I'm driving Jake to school.

Well, Judith's in Hawaii.

No, that does not make me
a doormat.

Patsy is just another word
for doormat, Mom.

L... Lo... I gotta go. I'll call you later.

Hi, Lorraine. I'm back.

No, no, don't put me on hold.

Question three:

"Do you think the Revolutionary War
would have been won sooner...

...if you had an army of the undead?"

This is actually pretty easy.

Lorraine, this is Dr. Harper.

Listen, I'm... I'm gonna be there
in about 40 minutes.

What do you mean,
you're going home?

Oh, come on.
You were premenstrual two weeks ago.

Yes, I keep track.

Question number four:

"What's your opinion of the new,
faster-walking zombies?"

No, no, no. Lor... Lorraine.

Don't cry. Please don't cry.

Charlie, I'm going home.

How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

- I'm going home.
- I suppose you want me to pay you.

Not necessary.
I took the money out of your wallet.

- Fine.
- Guess what? I got a raise.

Congratulations.

- You wanna know why I got a raise?
- No, I'm sure I had my reasons.

Because when I took this job,
all I had to do was clean up after you.

And while that may
have been disgusting, it was doable.

And then your brother moved in, which
I accepted with my usual good humor...

...because he cleans up after himself
like a neurotic raccoon.

This is about the kid, right?

Good for you.
That's why you're the boss.

He's just here for a week.
It's a temporary situation.

And yet my raise is permanent.

Sounds fair.

God, what a horrible day.

- Tell me about it.
- Show of hands:

Who spent their day
pre-soaking the shorts of a kid...

...who leaves more skid marks
than a getaway car?

That's what I thought.

Now, if you ladies will excuse me...

...I have three buses to catch.

I bet she catches them by hand.

Yeah, well, I have my own problems.

I was late for work,
my receptionist went home early...

...because, apparently, she has
the reproductive cycle of a jackrabbit...

...and then I had a large,
drunk Samoan man walk in...

...who thought that chiropractor means
"massage with happy ending."

I kept trying to crack his back and
he kept rolling over and winking at me.

- Wow, that's creepy.
- Tell me about it.

So you're gonna see him again?

Or should I say,
are you gonna see him Samoa?

Oh, come on. That was funny.

Oh, yeah. It's hilarious.

You know what your problem is?

- You don't drink enough.
- You're probably right.

This is the first time today I've had a
chance to just sit down and decompress.

- Cheers?
- Oh, cheers.

Oh, that's good.

I keep having this nagging feeling
that I forgot something.

- Lf you forgot it, it wasn't important.
- Yeah, I guess.

I can't believe you forgot me.

I said I'm sorry.

You forgot me.

I know. I feel terrible.

How many kids you got?

- There's a towel on the floor, buddy.
- I'm okay.

I want you to sit on it so you don't leave
a wet ass-print on my leather seats.

You forgot me too.

Yeah, but I'm just your uncle.

He's your father.

Yeah, my own father.

Thanks, Charlie.

Is there any way
I can make it up to you?

- You wanna go out for a special dinner?
- No.

- How about a movie?
- Why?

You're gonna leave me there too?

For the last time, I am sorry.

Won't be the last time.

I just wanna go home.
I'm cold and I'm wet.

If you kick the back of my seat again,
you're gonna be colder and wetter.

Ease up on him.
He's had a rough day.

Yeah, my dad left me out in the rain.

I'm sorry.

What did I tell you?

What's all this stuff on the floor?

I don't know. Junk mail.
Parking tickets.

- What's this?
- Satin blindfold.

- For what?
- What do you mean, "For what"?

In case I run into...

...a piñata.

- You're unbelievable.
- Don't judge.

You felt up a Samoan dude.

Hey, this is for me. From the IRS.

It was mailed a month ago.

Damn post office.

Oh, perfect.

- Just freaking perfect.
- Good news?

I'm being audited.

They wanna see me tomorrow.

Oh, well, look at the upside.

What upside?

Yeah, okay, you got me.

How could you forget
to give this to me?

I don't know. How could you
forget your only son in the rain?

- Yeah.
- Yeah. Watch the cleats.

Let's go, sleepyhead.
Rise and shine, up and at 'em.

Get out of my room
or I'll kill you with my bare hands.

I'm being audited today.
You have to take Jake to school.

Put him in a cab.

Oh, please. I am counting on you.

Then you're headed
for disappointment.

You need to get Jake dressed,
make him his lunch...

...and get him to school by 8, okay?
- Okay.

- You're not moving.
- Yes, I am.

I'm flipping you off under the covers.

Get up!

All right, I'm up.

So you know what to do with Jake?

You have to be responsible.
You have to be me today.

- Think you can handle that?
- You left him out in the rain yesterday.

It's not like you set the bar real high.

- Charlie.
- Relax.

I think I'm capable
of getting your kid to school.

Good, because I really need your help.

So... So I'm gonna leave now.

You're all set, right?

Charlie?

Get up!

Get dressed.
I'm taking you to school.

I can't. I'm sick.

Yeah, well, bite me.

- Hey.
- Don't... Don't screw with me, shorty.

I only got, like,
nine hours of sleep last night.

- Now get dressed.
- I'm supposed to take a shower first.

Sit near a window.

- Here, put these on.
- I wore these yesterday.

They're still extremely stylish.
Put them on.

- Can I have some privacy, please?
- For what? You're 11.

That's close to puberty.

Okay, okay.

I'm leaving.

What am I, nuts?

Get up!

I could have dressed myself,
you know.

You had your chance.

I look stupid.

Yeah, well, you're close to puberty.

Oh, I forgot to comb my hair.

No, no, no. I'll do it.

That's spit.

Hey, one man's saliva is another
man's mousse. Now shut up.

There, you're beautiful. Let's go.

- What about lunch?
- Sorry, I have plans.

No, you're supposed to
make me lunch.

Oh, all right, come on.

You're not really a morning person,
are you?

You're just saying that
because I spit on your head.

- You like cold pizza, right?
- Sure.

- This is frozen.
- Yeah. If you sit on it...

...it'll thaw by lunch.

My butt is freezing.

You wanted pizza.

All right, I'll put the seat warmer on.

Cook it from both sides.

- I like it better when my dad takes me.
- Oh, gee, you're not having fun?

Because I'm farting rainbows
over here.

First, he forgets me.
Now he leaves me with you.

Hey, you know what?

Your father works like a dog
to make sure you have everything.

If he's not there for you...

...it's just because he's trying
to stay out of federal prison.

I think he needs to have sex.

I was kidding about prison, Jake.

What do you mean
he needs to have sex?

Well, he's been really grumpy lately.

You're usually in a good mood.
I figure it's because you have sex.

Jake, it takes more than sex
to make a man happy.

You also need money.

All right, have a good day.

- Learn something.
- This isn't my school.

- What do you mean?
- I mean, I don't go to school here.

Well, where do you go to school?

Woodward Avenue Elementary.

- And where the hell is that?
- Woodward Avenue, I guess.

I don't know why you can't
tough it out here for one day.

Make some new friends.

Hey, Alan, it's Charlie.

Look, I wanna ask you something but I
don't want you to read anything into it.

Where exactly is Jake's school?

You don 't know where his school is?

What the hell is wrong with you?

- Are you trying to kill me?
- You could be right about the sex thing.

Okay, Woodward Avenue
Elementary School.

Looks like they're closed.

That's because I'm an hour late.
Even the crossing guard is gone.

How about this? Why don't you just
bag school and we'll go catch a movie.

- I can't skip school. I'm in the play.
- What play?

The founding fathers' play.
You'll be there, right?

Why would I be there?

Because Mom's in Hawaii and Dad's got
that tax thing and you're all that's left.

Oh, I'm all that's left.

Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either.

Okay. Where and when?

In the auditorium after lunch.

Oh, yeah. I need
a Ben Franklin costume.

You're telling me this now?

I told Mom but she's in Hawaii.

All right.

Let's see.
Washington, Jackson, Lincoln.

Here we go. Benjamin Franklin.

Why can't you be Lincoln?

A beard, a mole, a top hat,
we're done.

Because Lincoln
wasn't a founding father.

Okay, I'll see what I can do.

Now get out of here.

Hey.

You forgot your lunch.

Hey.

God, what a day.

I don't wanna hear it.

You know why I was being audited?

Not because I have unsubstantiated
deductions. Which I have.

Not because I take the occasional
cash payment from a client...

...and forget to report it. Which I do.

It was because no one at the IRS...

...could believe I was paying
as much alimony as I claimed.

It took me three hours
to convince them that, yes...

...I am that big a schmuck.

Oh, boo-hoo.

You want a real fun time?

Try finding an extra small
Ben Franklin costume...

...at 9:00 in the morning.

Oh, right. The play. How was it?

Boffo. A smash.

Among the highlights were a 12-year-old
Chinese George Washington...

...with a powdered wig
and a snot bubble...

...and your kid in a bald cap
and granny glasses...

...holding a Tweety Bird kite and
announcing he's discovered elasticity.

- Oh, I wish I'd seen it.
- Don't worry, you will.

It was videotaped
from about 150 different angles.

I should tell him
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

- Yeah, you should.
- Is he in his room?

Here you go, pal. Your favorite.

Bacon double cheeseburger
and cheese fries.

And for dessert, I got fudge brownies
with that ice cream you like.

Is this supposed to
make up for everything?

- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

Look, Jake, I know it's been rough
and I'm sorry.

We're human, we make mistakes.
But I promise you...

...neither of us will ever,
ever forget to pick you up again.

Yeah, I still wanna go back to Mom's.

When is she coming home
from Hawaii, anyway?

Oh, crap.

.......... ********** ..........

Here. This is for you.

Thank you.

And I didn't get you anything.

It's your kid's toilet seat.

It's obviously in his way,
and I'm tired of cleaning it.

Oh, come on, Berta.

- He's 11.
- He's a pig.

I'll talk to him.

While you're at it,
you may wanna mention...

...the half-eaten egg salad sandwiches
in his toy chest...

...the dead marine life
at the back of the closet...

...and the booger collection
under the bed.

I'll do my best
to address your concerns.

Don't condescend to me, Zippy.
I'll snap you like a butter bean.

Excuse me. Is one of you Alan?

I'm Alan.

Oh, good.
Charlie wants you to come upstairs.

- Why?
- Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

- Try.
- Oh, yeah, try.

Well, he's kind of stuck.

- In what?
- In what?

Not in anything, just stuck.

Would you hurry?

- Where are you going?
- Oh, like I'm gonna miss this?

Charlie? Are you okay?

Do I look okay?

- What happened?
- I pulled my back.

I didn't do anything. I was lying there
and he started screaming.

- I understand.
- I mean, I wasn't just lying there.

- I got it.
- Damn, I wish I had a camera.

That's okay. It's all on video.

Alan, you're a chiropractor.
Do something.

Really? You want my help?

Even after you referred to
my profession as, what was it...

..."urban voodoo"?

I'm sorry. Now help me.

Okay. Okay.
We'll see what we can do.

Yeah, yeah, okay,
very funny, very funny.

Hold on.
Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster.

Check your kid's room.

Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you're
not feeling well, but I have an audition.

- Go.
- It's a Wheat Thins commercial.

- I'm an actress.
- Of course you are.

I had a nice time, Charlie.

- I'll call you.
- Great.

Oh, if you find my tongue stud,
let me know.

Okay, let's see what we've got here.

- Is this tender?
- A little.

- On a scale of one to ten?
- I don't know. Three?

- Okay, what about this?
- Four.

And what about this?

I'm gonna need a number, Charlie.

No, no, I changed my mind.
Leave me alone.

Oh, don't be a baby.

- Stay away.
- I have to examine you.

- It's okay. I'm better.
- No, you're not.

- Now, stop moving.
- Really, I'm fine. Just don't...

Ten. Ten. That's a ten.

- Are you happy?
- Do I look happy?

Let's get you back on the bed
so I can give you an adjustment.

No, no, no, no. New plan.

I need someone
who can give me drugs.

I'm not holding,
but I can make a couple calls.

Drugs just mask the problem.

Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it,
and let it fight crime.

I just want it to go away.

Good news. I think I know where
Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud.

For the love of God.

Oh, mommy.

Feeling better?

No, I just passed out for a second.

Berta, I'm gonna take Charlie
to the doctor.

- You keep an eye on Jake.
- Fine.

Whoa, hey.

And please put his toilet seat back on.

I really think you should
put on your seat belt.

Do you now?

Did you forget it took three of us
just to put on my shorts?

Suit yourself. I should call your doctor
and tell him we're coming.

- What's his number?
- I don't know.

All right, I'll call directory assistance.
What's his name? Where's he located?

Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills.

- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

Well, I need a first name.

I remember his
receptionist's name. Julie.

Cute redhead with a slight
speech impediment.

She called me "Charlie."

I almost asked her out once...

...but I couldn't face
the inevitable phone calls.

"I love you, Charlie.
Don't leave me."

Yeah, yeah,
and your doctor's first name is?

Oh, I have no idea.

Idiot.

Yes, Beverly Hills, California.

Dr. Schwartz.

Yeah, I don't know the first name.

No, I'm not kidding.

There are 128 Dr. Schwartzes
in Beverly Hills.

What street is he on?

Wilshire Boulevard, I think.

Wilshire Boulevard, we think.

Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes.

Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire.
I'll know the building when I see it.

Never mind, we're gonna play...

...Find the Jewish
Doctor in Beverly Hills.

Wait, wait. There it is.

Now, you see,
that wouldn't have happened...

...if you'd been wearing your seat belt.

Alan, if I can ever use my legs again...

...the first thing I'm gonna do
is kick your ass into your throat.

That's not Julie.

- So?
- It's just important to me that you know.

- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper.

- I need to see my doctor.
- Do you have an appointment?

No, but this is an emergency.

He has to get back to Notre Dame
and ring the bell.

Oh, I get it. He's hunched over.
That's funny.

Yeah, can I see my doctor, please?

- Who's your doctor?
- Dr. Schwartz.

- Stanley Schwartz?
- Yes, Stanley.

- It's Stanley.
- Thank you.

When was the last time
you were here?

I don't know.
A couple of years ago. Why?

- Dr. Schwartz passed away.
- Oh, no.

So where's Julie?

Julie we had to let go.

She was playing a little fast and loose
with the old prescription pad.

I'm guessing Valium.

Is there somebody else
who can see him?

Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor,
okay?

Dr. Talmadge took over
Dr. Schwartz's practice.

It's a little tight right now,
but I could squeeze you in.

That's kind of how this happened.

Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury.

Well, thank goodness you're okay.

This is really gross.
Why do I have to do it?

- You want your toilet seat back?
- Yes.

Then keep scrubbing.

You know, taking it wasn't funny.
I could have broke my butt.

Oh, come on.
How could that not be funny?

Don't forget to clean on the outside.
That's all you.

- And the floor, and the wall.
- Okay, okay.

How in the hell
did you hit the wall anyway?

I don't know,
it just gets away from me sometimes.

After a day scrubbing toilets...

...I'm betting you'll be able to pee
through a Cheerio at 10 paces.

Oh, God.

Oh, jeez.

Hey, guess what.

The Soviet Union
is boycotting the Olympics.

My pain is just a big joke
to you, isn't it?

I offered to help you, Charlie,
and you refused, so...

...yeah.

I'll tell you, if you came to me
as a patient in this much pain...

...I wouldn't make you wait.
I'd see you right away.

So would my dry cleaner,
but I don't let him touch me either.

I could help you, Charlie.

I've already isolated
the source of your discomfort.

All that's left would be
to realign your vertebrae...

...through a gentle series
of manipulations and stretches...

...thereby alleviating your pain.

Well, you didn't explain it like that.
That's different.

- So you'll let me work on you?
- Not in a million years.

Fine. Worship at the altar
of the American Medical Association.

Swallow the pharmaceutical companies'
propaganda.

I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it,
I'll insert it rectally.

Anything to kill the pain.
I'm dying here.

Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge.

Hello, doctor.

Hallelujah. It's a miracle.

So I see you're having some back pain.

That will be $ 100, please.

Yeah, it started in my back...

...but now it's kind of radiating out
into a body-wide unbearable agony.

You have a really cute little nose,
you know that?

- Did the pain start in your lower back?
- Best I can tell...

...it's a spasm between
L4 and L5.

- Oh, are you a doctor?
- Yes, I'm a chiropractor.

So no.

How did this happen?

Well, I slipped.

On an actress.

I can handle this, Alan.

Okay, see, the thing is,
I was in the middle of...

An actress.

I'm warning you.

- Do the details really matter?
- No, no, I think I got the picture.

There's video if you need it.

Keep it up.

Okay, I see here your last visit
was four years ago.

A mild hernia brought about by...

Okay. I think I'm seeing
a pattern here.

He's a sexual compulsive
with narcissistic tendencies.

Oh, so you're
a pretend psychiatrist too.

So, what's the course
of treatment here?

A pill, a shot?
Maybe one of those epidurals?

First I'm going to get
your blood pressure and take x-rays.

- I take blood pressure and x-rays.
- Your mother must be very proud.

Actually, no.

Someone will be in
to take you to x-ray.

Wait. I'm still in pain.

Try and hang in there.
In the meantime...

...maybe your little buddy
can give you a massage.

- Can you believe her?
- Yeah, she is something else.

Please don't tell me you're interested
in that condescending...

...arrogant excuse for a woman.

Pardon me, Alan,
but that is a condescending...

...arrogant, hot excuse for a woman.

She's just your typical obnoxious MD.

I'm a doctor.
I have special license plates.

I can park wherever I want.

I know where I wanna park.

You're unbelievable.
Does your penis have an off switch?

A pause button?

No, just a little freckle.

You're always telling me I should date
a better class of woman.

What's classier than a doctor?

Oh, please. Four years of med school,
two years of internship...

...a year of residency,
and everybody thinks they're so special.

But I'll tell you something.
A new day is dawning.

A day of reckoning.
And it is spelled HMO.

No more country clubs.
No more Cadillacs.

Just sky-high insurance premiums
and low, slow, copay reimbursements.

Just like the rest of us.

I'll bet she knows a lot
of secret anatomy stuff.

You know, places you touch
and the top of your head flies off.

If you have sex with a doctor,
there's a chance they'll split...

...in the middle of the night
for an emergency.

Well, that's just a price
you'll have to pay.

No, no. That works for me.

Okay, I finished the toilet,
the shower...

...and the sink.
- What took you so long?

I went to the bathroom,
and I had to start over.

Take these, and get started
on the kitchen floor.

Why? I didn't pee in here.

Okay, once, but it was in the sink.

The sink? How'd you manage that?

It's not that hard. You just gotta
drink a lot of root beer, lean back...

...and figure the angle.

So tell me about Dr. Talmadge.

- Is she seeing anybody?
- Yes.

- Is it serious?
- Dog bite.

- No, I mean...
- Charlie, give it a rest.

What?

You're sitting here in pain
because of a casual sexual encounter...

...and now you're trying
to drum up another one.

- Yeah, so?
- Don't you get it?

Your entire life is about jumping...

...from one shallow,
meaningless relationship to the next.

And?

You're a grown man.
You can't go through life...

...drinking and partying and humping
anything that doesn't shake you off.

Yes, I can.

But sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to you.

Eventually,
you will have to pay the piper.

- Who says?
- Everybody says.

Really? Because I'm just hearing you.

If 2000 years of human history
has taught us anything...

...it's that there is karmic justice
in the world...

...and that when people live
the way you do...

...bad things happen to them
to even things out.

Well, I don't agree.

It's not up for debate.

It's a law, like gravity.

Oh, I agree with gravity.

Good, we wouldn't want you
flying off the planet...

...with nothing to hump
but satellites.

If it makes you feel better,
something bad happened.

- I'm in excruciating pain.
- That's not enough.

Trust me, Charlie.
The piper has yet to be paid.

The only question is how high a tab
you want before the bill comes due.

Okay. I get it.

Well, good.

So you think I have a shot
with that doctor, or what?

It's like trying to talk Shakespeare
to a Hershey bar.

Who's Piper?

Oh, you poor, clueless bitch.
Never trust a drifter with an eye patch.

- Berta.
- What?

I'm tired,
and my hands are all red and pruney.

I've seen your grades. Get used to it.

How do I know when I'm done?

Don't worry about that, honey,
I'll tell you.

Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him.
He's your brother.

- I have x-rays.
- Oh, good. Let me see them.

Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor.

Hey, I'm a doctor.

Oh, yeah? Where you parked?

Alan, you gotta relax.

You're harboring the kind of resentment
that eats away at your insides...

...until you wake up one day
peeing blood and crapping into a bag.

Thanks for the advice.

You know the difference
between you and me?

I have a functioning liver...

...and somehow,
you're gonna get laid tonight.

That's ridiculous, Alan.
She's an educated professional.

Probably gonna have to throw
a few fancy meals at her first.

Boo-hoo, you'll have to wait
a couple of weeks.

Couple of weeks?

Anyway, the difference
between you and me...

...is that when life gives me lemons,
I make lemonade.

When you get lemons,
you just bite into them...

...and suck them inside out.

Okay. Let's see what we've got.

No fractures, no dislocations.

- Looks like just a simple muscle spasm.
- Between L4 and L5?

Oh, good for you.

Okay, I am gonna give you a shot,
which should ease the pain...

...and also allow
your muscles to relax.

Have you had Demerol before?

No, but I've heard nice
things about it.

Okay, I'm just gonna pull
your shorts down a little.

But Dr. Talmadge,
I don't even know your first name.

- Michelle.
- Michelle.

That's prettier than Stanley.

- Sorry.
- That's okay.

It's all part of the little meet-cute
thing we got going here.

So how long does it take
before I start feeling...

...happy.

Happy, happy, happy.
Happy.

Michelle, did you know
I have a house on the beach?

- Really? I love the beach.
- Oh, good, because I have a house there.

Wait outside, I need to give your brother
a hernia exam to make sure...

...he hasn't reinjured the area.
- A hernia exam.

- And your boxers.
- Bye-bye, boxers.

I was wrong. There's no justice.

I thought there was justice,
but there's not.

What, you think there's justice?

Because there's not.

Turn your head and cough.

- You have very warm hands.
- Again.

You have very warm hands.

So any chance I could
take you out for dinner tonight?

- You're hitting on me?
- You started it.

- You're amazing.
- Well, statistically...

...I'm only slightly above average.

But I make up for it
with enthusiasm and perseverance.

No, what's amazing
is that you don't remember me.

Well, sure I remember you.

You're the pretty woman cupping
my testicles from earlier.

Back when I was in medical school,
you and I went out for a couple months.

You wanna loosen your grip there?

Then for reasons I never understood...

...you stopped calling me,
and started seeing my roommate.

The grip.

I always hoped I'd run into you again.

Please. Just leave me one.

Oh, dear God.

My brother's making lemonade.

I need to go to the bathroom.

So go.

Oh, yeah.

Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

- Night.
- Night.

So, are you gonna tell me
what happened with you and the doctor?

What do you think happened?

I think she shot you full of drugs...

...you dropped trou,
she jumped your bones...

...and you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the earth.

Well, for your information...

...that's exactly what happened.

Not even a little justice.

This is a justice-free zone.

Looking for justice?
Sorry, fresh out.

Enjoy sucking on that lemon.

Nope, not yet.

.......... ********** ..........

- Dad?
- Yeah?

Do you suffer
from erectile dysfunction?

Well, Alan? Do you?

Jake, wh... What do you know
about erectile dysfunction?

It's something to do
with your penis, right?

- Right.
- And they say one out of three guys...

...gets it, and mine's fine,
so it's gotta be one of you.

- I'm fine.
- Not me, l...

So, what are the pills for?

Well, what they do, Jake, is that
they... They dilate the blood vessels...

...which allows more blood
to easily flow to certain...

They're boner pills, Jake.

To get them,
or to make them go away?

To get them. Go get ready for bed.

What's the point?
They're not good for anything.

You ever try any of those drugs?

Once or twice.
Out of curiosity, not necessity.

- What did you think?
- Not my thing.

It's like corking the bat.
You?

Yeah, that's what my ex-wife wanted.
More sex with me that lasted longer.

Hello. Oh, hey, Eric. Hiya.
What's happening, boyfriend?

Oh, you're terrible. Do you kiss
your mother with that mouth?

So, what's up? Saturday?
Let me check my book.

Saturday is marvelous.

How dressy? Eveningwear,
or California casual?

Oh, goody. An excuse to shop.
Like I need one.

Okey-dokey, artichokey. Ciao for now.

- What?
- Something you wanna tell me?

That? Oh, that's Eric.
He's the head of a big ad agency.

- Throws a lot of jingle work my way.
- He wouldn't be gay, would he?

What difference does it make?
A person's sexuality...

...is a personal thing. It has no
relevance in the business world.

- But he is gay.
- Oh, yeah.

You know, it's okay
to call them queer again.

Good to know. Good to know.

Would it fair to assume that
you've led him to believe that...

...you are of a similar persuasion?

Not deliberately.
I kind of sort of backed into it.

- Excuse me?
- Okay. Poor choice of words.

When we first met, I found myself falling
into his... What do you call it?

Futon?

No, no, his manner
of expressing himself.

Tone, gestures.
Like talking to a Southerner...

...you start saying "y'all" and
"grits" and "tobaccy."

- Oh, Charlie.
- It's harmless.

He throws me work. I want
him to feel comfortable with me.

And how far do you go to
make him feel comfortable?

Don't worry. I just sparkle a little bit.
I don't burst into flames.

- I don't know how you live with yourself.
- Actually, I don't live with myself.

I have a significant other.

- What?
- We're both invited...

...to a cocktail party Saturday night.

What?

- No. Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

You always complain
we don't hang out.

I didn't mean I wanted to date you.

You don't think I'm gonna go to a gay
cocktail party stag, do you?

The way I sparkle?

I'm not going to be your gay lover
so you can make a few bucks.

Okay, first of all, it's considerably
more than a few bucks.

This man was responsible for almost
half my income last year.

And that's the half
I didn't gamble away.

And second of all,
you're not just my lover...

...you're my life partner.
That makes you special.

Forget it. It's immoral and deceitful,
and I don't want any part of it.

What's the big deal?
Gay people pretend to be straight.

They don't wanna be discriminated.

And neither do I. The minute this guy
finds out I'm a breeder, I'm history.

I don't care. If you wanna engage
in a fraudulent escapade...

...have one of your oafish poker
buddies be your partner.

You see? You see? Right there.
Escapade. Oafish.

What poker buddy
of mine talks like that?

But you, a couple of squirts of
Paco Rabanne, you're good to go.

Having a reasonable
command of English...

...isn't the exclusive domain
of the gay community.

Listen to you.
You're just making my point.

Forget it. You're asking too much.

Oh, really?

Was it too much when you showed
up on my doorstep, looking for a place?

- Charlie.
- Too much when I took in...

...your son on weekends and holidays?
- This isn't fair.

Too much when
I set up a college fund for Jake?

- You set up a college fund for Jake?
- You bet I will.

Unless, of course, my income
were to suddenly decline.

I can't believe you would sink so low.

To actually use emotional
and financial blackmail...

- You're both in my will.
- Really?

First thing Monday.

All right. But I want it on the record...

...I'm doing this under protest.
- Noted.

If we're gonna be a couple,
I'm the husband.

Well, who's gonna believe
you're the husband?

Of the two of us, I'm the
only one who's been a husband.

You really thought you were
the husband in your marriage?

Nevertheless, I'm going to be
the husband in this one.

Well, la-di-da.

- Thanks for babysitting, Rose.
- My pleasure.

Where are you guys going?

To a little party.

And you're taking Alan
instead of a date?

Yeah, well, funny story about that.

Okay, let's get this over with.

You're wearing that?

What's wrong with it?
You liked it in the store.

It looked different in the store.

Well, it was on sale. I can't return it.

- Dad, can we order pizza for dinner?
- No. Eat something healthy.

You want me to change, just tell me.

- Don't change.
- You don't like it.

I didn't say that.

I think you look very nice, Alan.

Thank you. See?
That's all I needed to hear.

- Well, you heard it. Now, come on.
- You know, I'm only doing this for you.

- I know.
- Could you show a little appreciation?

How about I show you a little
smack on the head?

That's your answer
for everything, isn't it?

What is that about?

I don't know, but one of them
suffers from erectile dysfunction.

Dad said we could order a pizza.

Would you please not walk so far in
front of me? I'm not your concubine.

I'm sorry.

What, are you ashamed of me?

A little bit.

Oh, boy. Charlie, we need to talk.

For the last time, you look stunning.

No, we... We need
to get our stories straight.

- What stories?
- We're a couple.

How long have we been together?
How did we meet?

Okay, fine. I met you in Thailand
and bought you from a guy.

I'm serious. If we're gonna pull this off,
we need to be convincing.

A favorite song?
Cute names for each other?

I mean, I don't even know if
we're dog people or cat people.

I forgot to tell you: The guy I bought you
from had your vocal chords removed.

- Charlie. I'm so glad you could make it.
- Oh, please. How could I not?

And you must be Alan. Welcome.

I'm the husband.

No, he's not. Stop saying that.

Listen to you two ladies.
Come on. I'll get you a drink.

Appletinis.

So how did you lovebirds meet?

Funny you should ask.
We were at the Coffee Bean...

...you know, the one in Larchmont
Village, where the pastries are to die for.

Anyway, we both
ordered a soy latte...

...when the first one came up, we both
reached for it, and our hands touched.

Oh, that is so romantic.

Yeah, it was one of those moments
that seems to go on forever.

Like this one.

- Are you starting?
- No.

Because I swear to God, I will walk
out that door and get in a cab.

- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, what?

I'm sorry...

...pookie.

Finish your story, Alan.

Well, okay. So... So there we are...

...our hands are touching, and we
look into each other's eyes...

...this one panics, spills coffee
over one of his hideous bowling shirts.

The only gay man in America
who dresses like Ralph Kramden.

To the moon, Alan.

Anyhoo, so I took him back to my
condo to "hand wash his shirt"...

...and, abracadabra,
hocus-pocus, here we are.

- That's a delicious story.
- Yeah, isn't it yummy?

Yeah, it kills me every time.

There's someone you just
have to meet. Don't go away.

Okey-dokey, artichokey.

You've gotta pull back a little.
You're gonna set off the smoke alarm.

- What do you mean?
- I mean, if you flame any more...

...you'll light the drapes on fire.

What about you?
"Okey-dokey, artichokey"?

What are you, the Jolly Gay Giant?

I want you both to meet someone
very special to me. Charlie, Alan...

...this is my very patient
and very forgiving ex-wife, Pamela.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

Hi. Wow, you were married?

It was before I'd gotten
a grip on my sexuality.

But not before you got
a grip on my cousin Walt.

Well, I can see why you
gave marriage a shot.

Pamela, you are a
breathtakingly beautiful woman.

Why, thank you, Charlie.

Why do all the cute ones
have to be married or gay?

Back off, sister. I caught this fish.

- Gonna tell me what's bothering you?
- Lf you don't know, no point discussing.

Fine.

You ignored me the whole night.

A party where I don't know anyone,
and you abandoned me.

Alan, listen closely.

It wasn't a real date.

Not the point. I was stuck
playing truth or dare...

...with your friend Eric and nine
producers from Will & Grace...

...while you had a wonderful
time talking to his hot ex-wife.

- I was just being polite.
- Oh, please.

- I saw the way you were looking at her.
- What, I can't look?

Not when you're supposed
to be with me.

How many appletinis
did you drink tonight?

Never you mind about that.
So... So, what are you gonna do?

Out yourself as a straight man so you
can sleep with your little Pamela?

No, no. That would mess
everything up with Eric.

Unless I convince him...

...that she temporarily
flipped me back to the home team.

Oh, if you're gonna go, just go.

Alan, eat something.
Toast, a waffle. Anything absorbent.

Don't blame this on the liquor.

Okay, here's what I can do.

She and I are going
shopping tomorrow.

I'll tell her I'm bisexual,
and then make my move.

So you're gonna cheat on me?

No, that's not cheating.

- How do you figure?
- Because we're not really gay.

Then how can you be bi?

Shut up.

Okay, well, good night.

- Aren't you gonna ask?
- No. Jake told me.

Oh, this is a cute top.

I'm more a bottom man myself.

I'll bet you are.

- Too slutty?
- Haven't you heard?

Slutty is the new black.

Oh, you.

Is there some special, young vagina
enthusiast you'll be taking that off for?

I wish. Can you keep a little secret?

I'm keeping a big one right now.

I haven't been with a man
in almost a year.

Oh, no. Color me sympathetic.

I don't miss dating. That's lies and
pretense. I do miss the sex.

Really? Well, what, specifically,
do you miss? And tell me slowly.

The feel of a man's hot breath
on the back of my neck.

His rough hands pulling me
to him and just taking me.

Of course, I don't need to tell you.

No, but I'm so glad you did.

Isn't it funny that I can only be
this honest with a gay man?

Yeah, it's a riot.

Straight men only want one thing, and
they'll tell any number of lies to get it.

- The dogs.
- Straight women are so competitive...

...they'll use anything
you say against you.

The bitches.

Gay women only want one thing, and
they'll lie worse than straight men.

Strange, because
they've already got it.

Oh, you, come here.

Oh, that's the other thing about
gay men. You're so hilarious.

Yeah, we're like clowns
who smell nice.

You know, these are pretty.

It's pretty sheer. Eric hated it when he
could see my nipples. That a gay thing?

Well, I can't speak for the community,
but I myself am nutty for nipples.

Let's try it on.

Okey-dokey, artichokey.

All right. Hold this.

Okay.

What do you think?
With or without the bra?

I don't know.
You're the one with nipple issues.

All right, then. Without.

Yes. Definitely without.

Am I starting to sag?

What... I'm sorry,
were you talking to me?

Am I hanging a bit low?

I don't know. Go like this:

- Now go like this:
- Stop it. Give me the blouse.

I am a woman, Charles.

- Wanna see my nipples?
- No.

Why not? You made me look at yours.

God, you are so frisky.
How does Alan ever put up with you?

How does his mother
put up with him?

Oh, boy.

Charles, didn't I ask you to confine
your debauchery to outlet stores?

Pamela, this is my mother, Evelyn.
Mom, this is Pamela.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Your son is adorable.

That seems to be
the conventional wisdom.

I met him and his partner last night,
but we immediately hit it off.

- I'm sorry. His partner?
- Alan, his lover.

His lover?

God, I'm not outing you, am I?

Oh, no, no, no. Mom knows
all about me and Alan. Right, Mom?

Of course. Alan's almost
like a son to me.

My ex's parents were not supportive
when he came out of the closet.

Oh, what a shame. What does he do?

He's in advertising.
Charlie writes jingles for him.

Oh, I see. One hand
moisturizes the other.

No, the only time Charlie
was ever in the closet...

...was when he was a little boy
trying on my hats and underwear...

...belting out the entire score
of Hello, Dolly!

It was Mame, Mom.

In fact, if anything, his lifestyle
has brought us even closer.

We cook together,
we shop together...

...we go to all kinds of parties
and charity events together.

Come to think of it, I have entered us
in an Alzheimer's walkathon this Sunday.

Sunday isn't really good for me.

But you will be there anyway...

...because we support each other in all
our little causes, and you love me. Right?

Right.

Say it.

I love you, Mom.

And I love you too.

Eight a.m. Sunday.

I'll buy us matching tracksuits.
It'll be cute.

- Lovely to meet you, Pamela.
- Bye.

If I didn't know you were gay, meeting
your mother would've convinced me.

Okay, that's it.
I can't do this anymore.

You can't stop shopping.
I've gotta find you something slutty.

I've already got something
slutty in my pants.

- You're terrible.
- Pamela, listen to me.

I'm not gay. I am completely,
100 percent, militantly heterosexual...

...and I find you incredibly attractive.
- Okay. I understand.

- You do?
- Of course. I went through this with Eric.

He wanted badly to be straight,
and he suffered so much before...

...he was able to finally accept
himself for who he is.

Oh, no. I accept myself for who
I am. I am a lying horndog.

- Charlie.
- Lf I were a straight man...

...would you find me attractive?
- That's hypothetical.

Play along. Humor me.
If I were straight...

I'd do you in a heartbeat.

Oh, good. Come with me.

Charlie, don't do this.
You don't have to prove anything.

Oh, but I do.

Now, come here.

You don't have to be
straight to be a good kisser.

I know, I know. Just wait.

Well...?

Give me a minute. I'm under some
pressure here. I just saw my mother.

Would it help if you thought of Alan?

Oh, great. Why don't you just
roll up a newspaper and hit it?

Charlie, sweetheart, it's okay.

No, it's not. I am a straight man.

I've always been a straight man,
and I'll always be a straight man.

Well, you'll forgive me, darling,
but you seem to have a gay man's penis.

Come on, let's go look at shoes.

It's a straight man's penis.
It's just having a bad day.

- Hey.
- Oh, I thought you'd never come home.

- We have to talk.
- Not now.

I need to drink beer, scratch my ass...

...and watch a whole bunch
of girl-on-girl porn.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Eric. What are you doing here?

I came over to talk to you about a
new account, and you weren't here, so...

So he invited me to Big Sur
for the weekend.

It's not what it sounds like.

Yes, it is. He looked into my eyes,
told me I had a tight little breadbasket.

No.

Look, the other night at the party, there
was a lot of friction between you...

...and I'm really sorry.

Yeah, I'll bet you're really sorry.

How do you expect me
to keep working for you?

Gosh, I hope you will.
I'll make it up to you.

How? How could you possibly
make up for this incredible betrayal?

- I'll get you more money.
- Done. Get out.

Bye, Alan.

Thanks for the sweater.

- He gave you a sweater?
- Cashmere. Very stylish. And thank you.

- For what? I didn't get you anything.
- You stood up for our relationship.

What relationship?
Alan, we're not gay.

No, but if we were, you wouldn't
let anybody steal me away.

And I think that's sweet.

You need to stop this.

I was just trying to get more
money out of him, and that's all.

Whatever you say. Pookie.

Is the breadbasket
the front or the back?

- The back.
- Oh, good. It wasn't just a line.

Pick it up, Charlie. We're lagging.

Gimme a break.
I haven't even been to bed yet.

Well, perhaps it's time for you
to reexamine your club-hopping...

...popper-sniffing, disco lifestyle.

I explained about that.

It doesn't matter, darling.
You're here, you're queer. I'm used to it.

.......... ********** ..........

Can't we just go home?

If I gotta drag you to the doctor
at 8 in the morning...

...you can cool your jets
while I get coffee.

I must look like an idiot.

Wish I could tell you different.

You're the reason we went
to the eye doctor in the first place.

You said,
"Throw me a piece of toast."

I threw you a piece of toast.

Two cups of regular coffee, please.

- My treat.
- Oh, that makes up for everything.

Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket,
but I get a free cup of coffee.

Just the coffee. Keep the change.

I'm gonna need your help
until I get this patch off.

I am absolutely there for you.

Great.

Great. So...

So you'll drive me to work,
pick me up, get Jake at school...

...do the grocery shopping...
- Okay, I may have misspoken.

Charlie, you have to.
You know I can't drive.

I don't see why not.

- Oh, look who's here.
- Who?

A girl I used to go out with.
Over there.

Hey, Sherri.

- Hey, Charlie, long time.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

- This is my brother, Alan.
- Hi.

- Hi.
- What happened to your eye?

Well, I wanted
a piece of toast, and...

Bar fight.

- Nice to meet you.
- Well, nice meeting you too.

- Good to see you, Charlie.
- Good to see you too.

- Wow, you went out with her?
- Yep.

Why would you stop?

I don't remember.
I probably got bored.

Bored? How do you
get bored with that?

For every beautiful woman,
there's at least one guy out there...

...who's tired of pretending to listen
to her in exchange for sex.

Well, let me go on record as saying,
I am not that guy.

If I ever had a woman like that,
I would cherish her.

I would worship her. I would...

...start a small country and put her
face on a stamp so I could lick her head.

- Why don't you go talk to her.
- Yeah, right.

Gorgeous women like that are
not interested in pasty guys like me...

...unless we're in line
for the British throne.

- So you give up without even trying?
- Yep. That's my motto.

Why waste time on 10s when you're
already getting rejected by sixes?

Alan, listen to me. You are a smart,
sensitive, good-Iooking man...

...with some milky discharge
coming out of one eye...

...but who amongst us is perfect?

That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

So? Women like Sherri have big,
hunky guys hitting on them all day long.

A guy like you walks up, makes a move,
you know what that says to her?

Trick or treat?

It says, "I'm confident in who I am."

- You think?
- I know.

So, what if she's not interested.
What's the worst that could happen?

Actually, the worst that could happen
is she points at me...

...and laughs, causing every
seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn...

...and watch me slink back
to the geek table...

...with a growing wet spot
on the front of my chinos.

We ninth graders enjoyed it also.

But you're not in junior high anymore,
and you're not a...

You're not in junior high anymore.

- It's time to let go of those fears.
- I don't know.

Oh, come on, Alan.

For once in your life, don't settle.
Go for what you really want.

You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

Hold on.

Let's clean some of that discharge.

You wanna say "I'm confident,"
not "I'm infectious."

There. Go get her.

Hey, you see that guy over there?
Twenty bucks says he wets himself.

- Hello.
- Hi.

- Alan?
- I remember.

Look, I needed to come clean
about something.

I wasn't actually in a bar fight.

I took a piece of whole-wheat toast
to the eye.

I mean, it was cut diagonally
and toasted well...

...so it was essentially shrapnel.

Did some real damage.

I see. And why do you feel the need
to tell me all this?

Well, I guess I didn't want
our relationship to start on a lie.

Our relationship?

- I'll go now.
- No, no, wait.

Sit down. Join me.

Okay.

- That's it. I'm out.
- Oh, come on.

No, no, no. No more.

You got a date. Leave it alone.

Not just a date. A date with...

Enough.

- I'd think you'd be happy for me.
- I am happy for you.

You had the courage to walk over...

...with your pus-filled eye
and fall on your ass...

...and still got a date with one of
the most beautiful women I've ever met.

- I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud.
- Thank you.

Now, I have to re-evaluate
everything I thought I knew...

...about men, women, relationships,
God and the universe.

But that's not your problem.

Charlie, I am as surprised as you
that she said yes.

I don't think so.

I was really intimidated, but as it turns
out, she's just like a regular person...

...except for, you know,
being from the planet:

Alan, never do that around me again.

You know, actually,
we have a lot in common.

Okay. I'll bite.

Well, we both went through
tough divorces.

- Sherri was married?
- You didn't know that?

- It never came up.
- What did come up?

Never mind. Scratch that.

Where should
I take her to dinner?

Where did you go
so I can take her somewhere else?

Last thing you want is for her
to start comparing you to me.

Exactly.

Wait.

What do you mean?

You want your relationship
to stand on its own.

- Right.
- Well, that's what I meant.

Okay. I thought you were trying to rub
my nose in the fact that you dated her.

Alan, I would never do that.

Well, thank you.

I don't have to.

You think you could kill a guy
with a piece of toast?

No.

Because if you did,
you could eat the toast.

The police would never find the
weapon. It's the perfect crime.

And part of a nutritious breakfast.

Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later.

Where you going?

- Out for dinner.
- With who?

Jake, look, I think...

I think you're old enough to know
that your dad's not just a dad.

He's also a man and that...

...even though I'm not married
to your mom...

...I still enjoy the company of women...

...which means that I will
occasionally go out with one.

But the important thing
for you to understand...

...is that I am not trying to
replace your mother.

In fact, no one
can replace your mother.

I bet you could kill a guy
with a piece of bacon.

All right, then.
I'm glad we had this talk.

I'm gonna go post my plan
on the Internet.

You know, there's moments
around here...

...that make me wish
I had a son of my own.

That wasn't one of them.

Yeah, well. Anyway, I really
appreciate you watching him tonight.

No problem.

- How you getting to the restaurant?
- Sherri's picking me up.

- Very convenient.
- Why?

Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?

Because you've had sex with her
in every room in the house?

No, because you can't drive.

But it's interesting to see
how your mind works.

Alan, let me give you some advice.

Alcohol impairs your ability
to make good decisions.

We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.

Of course. Very good.

What else?

Well, women like Sherri already know
they're beautiful and desirable.

- You won't score points by telling her.
- Okay.

Don't be in a hurry
to spill your guts.

She doesn't need your life story...

...before you get the salad.
- Got it.

As someone who knows your life story,
I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all.

Right, right.
I'll be cool, aloof, distant.

She's here, she's here, she's here!

What about the... What... What...

What about the kiss goodnight?

- Should I ask or just go for it?
- Go for it.

Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.

- Get it out of the way early.
- How early?

After dinner,
when you walk to the car...

...open her door, wait for her
to say thank you...

...smile, lean in, and kiss her.

Oh, nice.

Hi, Alan. You ready?

You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you.

That's another way to go.

- Madam.
- Thank you.

- Sir.
- Oh, thank you.

- Would you like the wine list?
- No.

I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir.
Or should we get a bottle?

Oh, definitely get a bottle.

Coffee for me.

You know, Sherri, I'd really like
to see more of you.

Maybe we should wait
and see how tonight goes.

No, I mean, I've only got one good eye.
Could we change places?

Oh, sure.

- Are you okay?
- Oh, yes, yes. Fine.

- This is a nice place.
- Yeah.

It's my favorite.

You ever come here with Charlie?

I don't know. Probably.

He's a big steak-eater.

I'm more of a fish guy.
You know, I'm surf, he's turf.

And we're cops.

- You're very cute.
- You too.

All right.
So tell me about yourself.

Well, there's not a lot to tell.

I was San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year...

...if you follow that kind of thing.

Recently divorced.

But not too recently. I've already had
my rebound, transitional relationships.

- So no worries there.
- Good to know.

Actually, it wasn't so much
a relationship...

...as a case of mistaken identity,
but I think it still counts.

- Okay.
- And...

...as you know, I live with Charlie...

...whom you've already...

- Met?
- Yeah, let's go with met.

Alan, is my having dated Charlie
gonna be a problem for you?

No, no, no. A little.

Okay, look. Charlie and l...

We had a very brief,
superficial relationship.

Okay? And to be honest,
it was mostly about sex.

Great.

My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those,
those shallow relationships...

...I was having with guys like Charlie.

I wanna be with a man who can be
sensitive and caring, nurturing.

You know, somebody who can
make me laugh, make me think.

You do realize I'm straight, right?

- See, you really are adorable.
- Thank you.

I tend to bring out
the mothering instinct in women.

- Oh, really?
- Ironically, not my mother.

What the hell are you doing?

Check it out. Ninja death toast.

Okay, stop it, stop it.

You're in no position
to give orders, Mr. Harper.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Death toast?
- Oh, thank you.

- So how did it go last night?
- Fine.

That's it? Fine?

Charlie, we're not in high school
anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail.

- Okay, don't tell me.
- Jake, go watch TV.

- I'm still hungry.
- There's bread all over the living room.

All right.

- Well?
- It went great.

She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'm
nurturing, caring and sensitive.

- I'm exactly what she's looking for.
- She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog?

She invited me to her house
for dinner tonight.

- I think she wants to have sex.
- With who?

- With me.
- With you.

Hang on a second.

Nope. No snowballs reported in hell.

No sightings of flying pigs.

- What am I gonna do?
- You don't know?

Come on, Alan,
you were married for 12 years.

What does marriage
have to do with sex?

Point taken.
Okay, you want some tips?

No, no, nothing like that.

I need step-by-step instructions.

All right. Since this is your
first bout in this weight class...

...I'd say stick with the basics.

Better to do the simple stuff well
than the fancy stuff badly.

Got it.
And the simple stuff would be...

Well, you know how women
like you to go slow?

Really? My ex-wife put
a premium on brevity.

Her motto was, " Less is more,
and none is perfect."

Well, Sherri's not like that.
You're gonna wanna take your time.

- I can do that.
- But don't loiter either.

You don't want her to get bored
and play solitaire on your head.

No loitering. Got it.

- Something else?
- Okay.

When you're with a woman like Sherri,
who's so gosh-darn beautiful...

...that you get excited
just thinking about her...

...how do you keep the sprinklers from
going off while you're still mowing?

Let me make sure I understand.

You wanna keep your toothpaste
in the tube until you're done brushing.

What are you talking about?

- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay. Let me try again.

I don't wanna frost the cake
while I'm still mixing the batter.

I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.

- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

All right. Here's what you do.

When you feel like the train
is leaving the station...

You mean, going in the tunnel?

No, no, I mean leaving the station.

But you have to leave the station
to get to the tunnel.

Okay, okay.

Let's start from the top.

And work our way down, right?

You know what?
Just shut up and listen.

When you're making love,
the way to slow yourself down is...

...to think of something
completely non-sexual.

- Well, what do you think of?
- You.

That was a really great dinner.

I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?

I've been ready since I was 14.

I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.

Okay.

Hey, how about Diana Krall?

Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD.
Do you mind bringing it back to him?

Not at all.

I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.

No problem.

Hey, this is a cool, little CD player.

Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your...
It was a gift.

Perfect.

Is there anything else
Charlie left behind?

Just me.

My brother's a fool.

No argument here.

- That is a very effective negligée.
- Thank you.

- Was it a gift?
- No.

- As a matter of fact, I bought it myself.
- Oh, good.

- How long ago?
- What?

Well, I was just wondering
if Charlie saw it.

Alan, don't go there.

Oh, I wasn't going anywhere.
It's just that...

- Nothing. More kissing.
- Okay, okay.

What exactly is bothering you?

Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

For example, once,
when Charlie and I were at camp...

...I lost my swim trunks, and I had
to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and...

...I just couldn't enjoy
the pool at all.

So, what are you saying?
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?

No, no. In this case,
I think you would be the pool.

Maybe this was a bad idea.

No, no, it's a great idea.
It's right up there...

...with the wheel, fire and refrigerators
that give ice through the door.

- Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
- What? Why?

You can't be with me without it being
some competition with your brother.

It's not a competition.

And even it was, shouldn't we do it
first before you decide who wins?

You are unbelievable.

- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.

Well, no ambiguity there.

Don't forget your brother's CD.

My eye!

Man, I love sunsets.

The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.

It's the pollution that makes
those pretty colors, you know.

What you're enjoying is the effect
of light passing through airborne poison.

No, that's not
what I'm really enjoying.

Boy, I hope that's guacamole.

.......... ********** ..........

- You got a date tonight?
- No.

Aren't you gonna ask me if I do?

Okay. You got a date tonight?

Sure, rub my nose in it.

Besides, I'd rather hang out
with you and Jake...

...than engage in mindless conversation
with some strange woman...

...in the desperate hope that
she might sleep with me.

Me too.

If we can't lie to each other,
who can we lie to?

To family.

- Who is it?
- It's Mom.

Oh, odds.

- Once, twice, three, shoot.
- Once, twice, three, shoot.

Hey, Mom.

No, I don't have a date tonight.

Don't you wanna know about Alan?

So, what's up?

Yes, I got your message.

I was gonna call you back, but...

I was.

I was.

I was.

Okay, I wasn't.

I'm sorry.

And do you wanna tell me
why you called?

I said, I'm sorry.

I am sorry. I am. I am.

All right, I'm not.

So, what's up? Tomorrow?

Yeah, sure. One of us will be here.

I'll be here.

All right, gotta go. Love you.

No, I'm not just saying that.

I'm not.

No, I'm not.

Mom, we both know where this going.

- Sorry to stick you with her.
- Yeah, sure.

- I am.
- Right.

- I am.
- Whatever.

Okay, I'm not.

Schmuck.

For 30 years, every time I call odds,
he throws a two, and I'm the schmuck.

- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

- Here's the bill for Jake's class trip.
- Why give it to me?

- So you can pay it.
- Me?

What's the point of giving
child support...

...if you don't support the child?

Child support doesn't cover
class trips.

- Says who?
- You wanna make an issue of this?

Have your lawyer call mine. They can
decide who pays for class trips.

Oh, I'm sorry. Class trips?

I'm happy to pay for class trips.

I thought you said "ass clips."

What are ass clips?

I don't know,
but I don't intend to pay for them.

Goodbye, Alan.

At least we settled who pays
for ass clips around here.

Okay, Mom. Good talking to you.

I'm gonna hang up now.

Yes, I am.

I am.

Okay, I'm not.

- Jake's here.
- Cool.

It wouldn't kill you to talk to Mom
once in a while.

We don't know that.

- Besides, you lost fair and square.
- I don't think so.

- I think you cheated.
- At odds and evens?

How on earth does one cheat
at odds and evens?

Don't give me that big, cow-eyed,
aw-shucks, Howdy Doody veneer.

- What?
- You heard me.

Yeah, I heard you...

...and as long as we're
stringing random words together...

...shoebox, MoonPie, Band-Aid.

Let me tell you something, Alan,
and I say this with no agenda.

I am not a judgmental person,
but you, you are a horrible little man.

You smile, tell everybody
what they wanna hear...

...but I know what goes on
inside your grinning puppet head.

You don't have a clue what's going on
inside my puppet head...

...because to know that,
you would have to be capable of...

...perceiving the world that exists
beyond the tip of your penis.

Don't talk about my penis.
You have not earned the right.

You are a selfish man, Charlie.
You're a user.

You just suckle from the teat of life
and you never give back.

"Suckle from the teat of life"?

Who are you,
Henry Wadsworth Pinhead?

- You call me that because I'm right.
- I call you that...

...because you can wear
a thimble as a hat.

Hey, what's going on?

- Nothing.
- Just hanging out.

Cool.

You know, if you guys were queer...

...we'd be what they'd call
an alternated family.

- Morning.
- Morning.

I feel bad about last night.

That's okay. I forgive you.

I didn't apologize.

Well, then I guess I'm just
a bigger man than you are.

I'm kidding. Forget about it.

Okay.

- What do you wanna do with Jake?
- I don't know. How about a barbecue?

Well, I'm sure the kid's delicious,
but I think I'd rather have hamburgers.

Dad, check it out.
Mom bought me new shoes.

- Very cool.
- Yeah, they were really expensive.

- I'll bet.
- She said to give you the bill.

What? Why do I get the bill?

So you can give me a check
to pay her back.

- Why?
- She doesn't trust me with cash.

No. Why should I be buying
your shoes?

You didn't. Mom did.

This is so wrong. I send her
a child support check every month...

...which is supposed to include things
like clothing, food, shoes.

Alan, you're like an Alzheimer's victim
in a whorehouse.

Excuse me?

You're constantly surprised that
you've been screwed...

...and you don't wanna pay for it.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Did you drop off the dry cleaning
by the back door?

That was dry cleaning?

I thought you were throwing
that stuff out.

You threw out my clothes?

I gave them to my sister's husband, Earl.

You gave three cashmere sweaters and
a new sport coat to your brother-in-law?

Why shouldn't he have nice things?

He's paid his debt to society.

You have to get them back.

I wish I could, but Earl's got
one withered arm...

...and he had all
the left sleeves hemmed.

Those were expensive clothes, Berta.

Wanna take it out in trade, stud?

Because this back brace snaps off
with the flick of a wrist.

Okay, okay, that's the last straw.

You have abused my good nature for too
long, and I am putting my foot down.

Well, you let me know
how that works out for you.

I guess we know
who's in charge around here.

If I want your opinion,
I'll ask your ex-wife.

Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
Well, if I want your opinion...

...I'll ask one of the dozens of women
you have meaningless casual sex with.

Oh, ouch.

- Hey, Uncle Charlie?
- What?

- I love you.
- What did you do, Jake?

I love you too, Dad.

- What did he do?
- How am I supposed to know?

Well, he's your knuckleheaded son.

He's my knuckleheaded son now,
but when you're trawling for tail...

...at The Home Depot,
he's your slow but adorable nephew.

I might as well get one perk
out of having you sponge off me.

- Sponge? Sponge?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

Well, let me tell you something.

Take away your fancy house,
your fancy car...

...your women,
and what have you got?

A better-Iooking version of you.

Have I mentioned how much
I hate you?

Have I mentioned how much
I hate you?

- Don't copy me.
- Don't copy me.

- You're an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

- I'm warning you, Charlie.
- I'm warning you, Charlie.

How childish.

Would you mind toasting my buns,
please?

To your buns.

You sicken me.

Hey.

- Hey, Rose.
- What's going on?

Just making lunch.

- Wanna join us?
- Maybe some other time.

A little garlic butter is also a good way
to jazz up a hamburger bun.

He's lucky all I'm doing is spitting.

It doesn't take a master's in behavioral
psychology, which I happen to have...

...to see that you and you brother
have unresolved fraternal conflicts.

Gee, you think?

I think it might be therapeutic
for you two...

...to sit down with someone
and explore those conflicts.

- You mean you?
- Well, I could refer you...

...to the woman I talk to,
but she doesn't exist.

So, yeah. Me.

Let's see. Couples counseling for me
and Alan with you as the therapist.

Why don't we just drop acid,
run out into the ocean...

...and pretend we're dolphins?

You're exhibiting
a lot of hostility, Charlie.

You know what we psychologists
call that?

- What?
- Hostility.

Why would we need
more than one word for it?

Rose, I appreciate your concern,
but Alan and I don't need therapy.

Everything will work itself out.

I'm just saying, I think
it would really help you guys...

...if you could sit down
and share your feelings.

We're fine, Rose.

- Choke on it, princess.
- Bite me, bitch.

I think he may have anticipated that.

- How Freudian.
- It's not Freudian.

But mine's bigger.

It's a banana, you moron.

It's not just about you and Charlie,
you know.

There's that innocent little moppet
to consider.

Moppet?

I'm baking air biscuits.
Get them while they're hot.

He may not be able
to process it now...

...but he picks up on all
the negative emotion around here.

Save yourselves, run for your lives!

Okay, well, if you can
get Charlie to agree, I'll do it.

- Good.
- And as a rule...

...when says they're bad,
take his word for it.

Oh, please, Alan. I grew up with
two older brothers and...

Oh, my God!

The only reason I let him live here
is because of Jake.

Go on.

He was a pain in the ass
when we were kids...

...and now he's blossomed into
a three-fingered prostate exam.

Have you considered the possibility
that since you're the older brother...

...you harbor resentment
towards him...

...for usurping Mommy's love
and attention?

I'm sorry, have you met my mother?

Okay, so that's a no.

Please don't try to psychoanalyze me.

Oh, Charlie.
Psychoanalysis takes years.

I'm just messing around
inside your head.

Have you ever considered
the possibility...

...that you are the primary
male role model in Alan's life?

And if his behavior is making you mad,
he learned it from you.

So, in fact, you are making you mad.

That's nuts.

Just sit with it for a moment.
I think it's a pretty good insight.

No, I'm gonna stick with nuts.

And I don't wanna continue this.

Do you feel you can't be
totally honest with me...

...since we slept together?
- No.

Why can't you be totally honest?

- I can be totally honest with you.
- Really?

How much did you like
having sex with me?

Let's go talk to Alan.

And they wouldn't give me a license.

All right. Let the healing begin,
you pinhead.

Can we refrain from
counterproductive name-calling?

Such big words
from such a little head.

Charlie, please sit down.

Okay. Here are the ground rules.

There will be no name-calling
and no interrupting.

The purpose of this is
to air our feelings without judgment.

- Alan, why don't you start?
- Why does he start?

- Would you like to start?
- No.

Then shut up.

Alan, you'll go first.

And begin with the phrase,
"I feel Charlie is 'blank.'"

I don't think I can top that.

Okay, I feel like Charlie is...

...ashamed to have me as a brother.

Well, there you go. Are we done?

Charlie, you'll get your turn.

When was the first time
you felt that way, Alan?

I guess on the playground.

The first day of kindergarten,
he told his friends...

...that I was a shaved monkey
our mom won in a poker game.

Charlie, why do you think you might
have said something like that?

Well, I guess deep down...

...I always wanted a shaved monkey.

You promised Mom
you would look after me.

I was 7 years old.
You can't trust a 7-year-old.

You know how he looks after me?
He gave me wedgies.

From kindergarten on,
I got daily wedgies.

My butt cheeks didn't unclench
until my second year of college.

At which point, a long stick slid out.

Let's try a little role-playing.

He put dog poop in my
Mork and Mindy lunchbox.

Oh, will you please let that go?

And by the way,
if you think it through...

...we didn't have a dog.
- What?

Mom told me to make you lunch,
I made you lunch.

Oh, my God! Do you see...

...what I have been dealing with
my entire life?

The real genius was putting it
in a hot-dog bun.

All through the second grade...

...he would introduce me
as his ugly sister, Alana?

That's because all through second grade,
you wore culottes.

They were extra roomy Bermuda shorts.
I was prone to chafing.

Charlie, how did you feel when you
were calling Alan a monkey or a girl...

...or putting excrement in
his lunchbox?

It's hard to describe.

It was kind of a warm,
satisfied feeling.

And why do you think
you felt that way?

Because he was such a smartass.

Straight A's, Mommy's favorite,
Daddy's boy, stepdaddy's boy.

Somebody had to take him down a peg.

- You were jealous of me.
- No, no.

- I was annoyed.
- I don't believe it.

- You were jealous.
- No, I wasn't.

- Sounds like you were, Charlie.
- You can't take sides.

- That's unprofessional.
- Professional?

I'm just making this up as I go along.

I'm drawing kitty-cats here.

All these years,
you had to put me down...

...because you secretly believed
that I was better than you.

No, that's ridiculous.

I knew I was better,
but I didn't think you knew.

No, no, I didn't know that.
There was nothing to know.

I don't buy it. You were
an emotionally wounded child.

I wasn't wounded.
I was the wounder.

He was the woundee.

I was a mean, rotten brother.
You've gotta believe me.

I tortured him.

Once, I convinced him
the clothes dryer was a time machine.

When he got out,
I was dressed in Pilgrim clothes...

...and threatened to burn him
as a witch.

And now I understand why
you did all those things.

- And I forgive you.
- Don't forgive me.

Hate me. Fear me.

- Come here.
- No.

- Come on. Give me a hug.
- No, forget it.

- Would you rather hug me?
- What would be the point of that?

It gets me hot.

All right, if it'll put an end to all this,
one hug.

Hey, what are you doing?

Let's see how you like a wedgie.
Where's your underwear?

I'm not wearing any,
but thanks for scratching my ass.

- This turned out to be a nice weekend.
- Yeah. Go figure.

Who would've thought Rose
would be right?

Certainly not Rose.

She was right.
We had a lot of baggage to clear up.

- Yeah, and I'm glad we talked it out.
- Me too.

You know, when all is said and done,
all we have in this world is each other.

You, me and that methane cloud
you call a son.

- It's Mom.
- Odds.

That's okay. I got this one.

- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom.

Oh, that's Judith.

No, I'm just sitting here, enjoying
the sunset with my favorite brother.

Alan.

I'm not lying. I'm not. I'm not.

Okay, I am.

Jake, your mom's here.

- Hey, Judith, how's it going?
- I just had a flat tire on the freeway...

...and called AAA, only to find
out I no longer have AAA...

...because you no longer pay my dues.
- Excuse me, but we're divorced.

- You pay that out of your alimony.
- No.

Because you didn't, I had to stand
on the side of the road...

...until a creepy man stopped
and offered to change my tire...

...if I'd show him my breasts.

Well, there you go.
I paid for your breasts.

Okay, fine.
We'll let our attorneys figure out...

...who pays for roadside service.
- No attorneys.

- I'm happy to pay for it.
- Thank you.

- Was that so hard?
- No. No, not hard at all.

- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, buddy.

In fact, it was easy.

All I had to do was bend over
and unclench.

Okay, I said it.

Mom, you just said I said it.

- Have fun at school.
- All right.

Charlie, wait up.

- Did you make Alan's lunch?
- Yep.

Hey, wait.
You forgot to kiss me goodbye.

- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

- Okay, I did.
- Charlie, wait up.

.......... ********** ..........

Jake, use your spoon.

Can't. I'll die.

If you don't turn off that music,
you'll die anyway.

Fine.

That's better.

He's still gonna be living here
when he's, like, 30.

My big fear is he'll still be
in fifth grade.

Hello, anybody home?
Grandmommy's here.

There's my grandson.

So, Mom, to what do we owe
this unexpected...

- Pleasure?
- No, that's not it.

I was showing a house, and
I thought I'd visit the people I love.

And they weren't home?

Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyon
that's going on the market soon.

- How do you know?
- Owner dropped dead of a heart attack.

You know what they say, darling.

Today's obituary
is tomorrow's exclusive listing.

Father of five in Westwood.
I'm on fire.

You will be soon.

Mom, you're not setting
a very good example here.

Why?

Jake, honey, your grandmommy performs
a very important public service.

When people die,
their families are very, very sad...

...and they have no idea
what their homes are worth.

And you tell them?

Oh, you are so cute.

And Grandmommy doesn't just
prey on the dead, Jake.

She also profits from the pain of divorce
and the humiliation of bankruptcy.

Not to mention she's working on an
alternative fuel made from puppies.

Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died.

Oh, no. Are you sure it's him?

How many Harry Luther Gorskys
are there in Los Angeles?

- Well, there's one less now.
- Who are you talking about?

He was Uncle Charlie's
and my stepdad.

- The first of three, and not my favorite.
- I liked him.

Oh, please. You were 6.
You still liked Mom.

- Mom, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

He was a good man...

...and part of my life,
and now he's gone.

I just pray he died peacefully...

...and held on to that stately
six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial...

...in Hancock Park...

...with the bonus office/guest room
over the garage.

Let me get this straight.

First there was your dad,
then this guy Harry who died...

...then the fat guy
with the carpet business.

No, no, no. The fat guy came after
the twitchy gay guy from Texas...

...who gave us crew cuts
and called us buckaroos.

So out of the three...

...Harry was the best.
- I liked the fat guy, remember?

With the chubby daughter
who was so grateful?

All you had to do was knock on her door
with some Turkish Taffy.

Be that as it may,
he was still a very good father to us.

Oh, please. He was a little tyrant.

"Sit up straight."
"Do your homework."

"Quit forging my signature
on hotel bills."

Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow.

I think it would be appropriate for us all
to go and pay our respects.

I don't know.
Tomorrow's not good for me.

Oh, Charlie. The man was your father.

No, he was not.

Why do you care so much?
You divorced him.

Just because you divorce doesn't mean
you no longer have feelings.

That's true.
Judith still has feelings for me.

Pity is not really a feeling, Alan.

Regardless of our feelings, we'll still go
and say our final goodbyes to Harry.

- I'm not going.
- Me neither.

- Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie.
- Cool.

Yeah, cool.
Why do you wanna go?

I think it's the right thing to do,
and I liked Harry.

- And he liked you.
- I know.

We've stayed in touch over the years.

What?

You betrayed me by communicating with
that son of a bitch after I divorced him?

Well, wait a minute.
You said that...

I know what I said.

I was just being polite because
the guy's worm chow.

All I did was send him Christmas cards
and a picture of Jake.

- You never send me a picture of Jake.
- He's right here.

When was the last time
I got a Christmas card?

Wait, I'm on your side.
Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go.

I don't even know if I want
you to come now. You've ruined it.

- How can you ruin a funeral?
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

- Where are you going?
- I need something black.

Doesn't your soul qualify?

Laugh now, but when I die,
I will be coming back to haunt you.

How will that be any different
than this?

Okay, Jake.
I'm going to pick up your grandmother.

Okay.

You think maybe
you've played that enough?

Okay.

I might as well just buy him
a crack pipe.

Hey!

- Let's get this over with.
- You're coming to the funeral?

I thought about it and realized,
even if I didn't like the guy...

...that shouldn't stop me from
going to his funeral...

...and, you know, taking a victory lap.

Charlie, you're not
gonna wanna hear this...

...but you sound a lot like Mom.

Tread lightly.

- Jake, you're coming with us.
- I don't wanna.

You get to see a real dead guy.

There's gonna be a dead guy? Where?

- At the funeral.
- Oh, cool. Can I come?

Did I say he was gonna
live here until 30?

I meant forever.

What are you talking about?

- Go put on your nice clothes.
- Okay.

He doesn't know
what nice clothes are.

- Jake?
- Oh, right.

Isn't it a little early to start drinking?

- Would you like a snort?
- That's what I meant.

Thanks.

You okay, Mom?

I just can't believe he's gone.

Isn't that why we're going
to the funeral? To make sure?

I'm confused. If you cared for Harry
so much, how come you left him?

Yes, well, about that.

I may have glossed over the details
with you boys just a skosh.

I didn't actually leave Harry
so much as he left me.

- You're kidding.
- He met a younger woman...

...and just traded me in.

You still loved him, didn't you?

I loved him very much.

Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry.

All right. Level eight.

So where's the dead guy?

Jake, show a little respect.

Where's the dead guy, sir?

In the chapel. Now keep it down.

I think I can smell him.

Oh, Lord. There she is.

- Who?
- The tramp who stole my husband.

Not bad.

Not good.

I'm gonna go mourn.

- Yeah, me too.
- Stay put. Mommy needs you.

- Hello, Evelyn.
- Hello, Christine.

- This is my son, Alan.
- Hello.

And who's this little guy?
Your grandson?

I'm just here to see the dead guy.

Yes, I've been blessed with
both children and grandchildren.

How about you? Oh, wait, I remember.

You were slightly less fertile
than a sand trap.

We're very sorry for your loss.

It's not my loss.
He left me for that tramp over there.

She doesn't look very unhappy,
does she?

She just met him. Wait a week.

I think it's the responsibility of we,
the living, to carry on...

...to live life to the fullest.
Embrace it.

Kiss it on the mouth, if you will.

Excuse me, Charlie,
can I talk to you for a minute?

Sure. Heather,
this is my brother, Alan.

He lives with me
at my beach house in Malibu.

- Hi.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

- Thank you.
- Alan came to live with me...

...at my Malibu beach house
when he lost his wife.

It's a healing house.

My wife isn't really dead.

Because you healed.

At my Malibu beach house.

And when you think about it,
Harry isn't really dead either.

He lives right here...

...in all of us.

- Thank you.
- Good. Let go.

It's good to let go.

Charlie.

Excuse me a moment.

What, what, what, what, what?

What do you mean,
"What, what, what"?

- You're hitting on the widow.
- No, I'm consoling the widow.

I won't hit on her
until they close the lid.

Unbelievable.
How do you sleep at night?

Usually drunk and on top of somebody.

But that takes work, Alan.
Doesn't just happen by itself.

Here's an idea. Why don't you run
to the embalming room...

...and see if you can score a couple
fresh ones off the truck?

Excuse me,
but considering your ex-wife...

...I'd say you're the expert on having sex
with cold women who don't move.

Nevertheless, you can
hit on women anywhere.

Why did you bother to come?

I don't know. I just did.

- That's it? No reason?
- Do you have a reason for everything?

- Yes.
- So how's that working out for you?

I know how difficult it must be...

...rambling around all by yourself in that
big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial...

...with the guest room/office
over the garage.

Harry gave me a potbellied pig.

So you'd remember him, sure.

But I know Harry would want you
to move on...

...and this is the perfect time
to move on...

...because this is a seller's market.
- Excuse me.

Can we talk to you a minute?

Pardon me, dear.

What? I'm working here.

That woman just lost her husband.

Alan, the man was 50 years old
when she was born.

- So?
- So she had to see it coming.

Even for you, that is really cold.

Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in.

You were trying to give the widow
a sympathetic crotch to cry on.

Hey, watch your mouth.
This is a solemn event.

Yeah, show a little class.

Me? I'm the only one here
behaving appropriately.

Hey, where's Jake?

- Jake.
- How do you know my name?

- It's okay.
- Okay?

I almost pooped my pants.

What are you doing?

I just wanted to see.

Okay, well, let's... Let's take a look.

- Really?
- Yeah. Come on.

- What do you think?
- I don't know.

- How did he die?
- He just got old.

His heart stopped.

His watch is still going.

- Yep.
- Why would he need a watch, anyway?

It's not like he's gonna be
late for anything.

Okay, there are other people waiting
to pay their respects.

Why don't we go find Grandma?

I don't care what anybody says.

I always thought you were a good guy.

Thanks, Alan.

Want to know what time it is?

Let's go.

- How's he look?
- Dead.

Cool.

Surprise.

Listen, I just wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking about it...

...and maybe some of the stuff
between us may have been my fault.

I was angry about losing my dad,
and I guess...

...you were the guy I took it out on.

Anyway, not that it makes
a lot of difference at this point...

...but I just wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

By the way, I'm gonna take a shot
at your wife.

But that's just a guy thing.

Nothing personal, okay?

I'll take that as a yes.

And so with every door that God closes,
he opens a window.

Did he say "window" or "widow"?

Even as we say goodbye
to our beloved friend...

...Harry Luther Gorsky...

...we know that he lives on
in all of us.

- How are you holding up?
- Okay.

- Lf you need anything, I'm right here.
- Thank you. That's very comforting.

For everything, there is a season.

A time to be born, a time to die.

A time to reap, a time to sow.

So...

...I would like to invite anyone...

...who wishes to say a few words
about Harry...

...to come up and share with us.

As always, I'll do him first.

- Mom, bad idea.
- Hey...

...if I didn't give in to bad ideas,
you wouldn't be here. Hold this.

Dad. I can't find my Gameboy.

Not now, Jake.

Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral.

I haven't seen him so drained
of bodily fluids since our honeymoon.

What? I thought I'd open with a joke.

My name is Evelyn Harper...

...or, as dear Harry used to call me,
his sweet little sugar tushy.

When I first met Harry...

...I was just a hot young widow
with bills to pay...

...who could lick the chrome
off a trailer hitch.

I also had two small boys...

...one of whom Harry cared for
very deeply.

The other one was Charlie.

It wasn't easy being
a substitute father...

...but Harry gave it his all.

Unfortunately, it wasn't enough...

...which is probably why
he looked for solace...

...in the arms of a cheap slut.

Stand up, Christine.
Let everybody have a look at you.

Take a good look, Heather.
That's gonna be you someday.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectful
to the grieving widow.

But, listen, you wanna talk grieving?
I'm grieving.

I loved this man with all my heart,
and you left me, you lousy bastard.

Well, take a good look.
I've still got a great ass...

...and yours is decomposing
as we speak.

Thank you.

- Okay. That was beautiful.
- Time to go.

I'll call you.

- Dad, what about my Gameboy?
- Forget it. Just keep walking.

And so let's take a moment
of silent prayer for our friend, Harry.

I am really, really sorry.

Got it.

It's my kid's. I don't know,
maybe I spoil him.

Okay, bye.

Boys, when I die...

...I want a simple funeral.
No tears.

- Done.
- You got it.

And I wanna be buried
next to your father.

Dad was cremated, Mom.

Oh, yes, right.

I was thinking of someone else.

So I take it you'd rather be
buried than cremated?

Oh, can't we do both?

I want to be buried
on the side of a hill...

...nestled amongst the willows,
overlooking the ocean.

Do we get to pick the ocean?

And I want an unadorned headstone,
which reads simply:

"Evelyn Harper.
Loving wife, devoted mother."

That's good. Open with a joke.

.......... ********** ..........

Charlie? Where's Charlie?

Check the living room.

- Charlie, guess what?
- Somebody call me?

Not me.

He's not in the living room.

- Try his bedroom.
- Thanks.

Charlie, you gotta see this.

Are you sure nobody's calling me?

Wouldn't I tell you?

Berta, he's not in his room.

- What?
- I said, he's not in his room.

What?

- Did you find him?
- He's not up there.

- Try Jake's room.
- What'd he be doing in Jake's room?

Hey, I'm just trying to help.

I'm sorry. Charlie!

I'm sure I heard something.

I don't know what to tell you.

I could do this all day.

Charlie.

Hey, Alan.

- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- Oh, that was you.

Of course it was me.
Who else would it be?

Don't snap at me.

I've been running all over
looking for you.

Well, I was right here.

I know that now.

Hey, that's no reason
to have a hissy fit.

Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit.

Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dogs
in the neighborhood didn't hear you.

I'm all done. I'm going home now.

- Thank you.
- Good night.

Good night, my pets.

Now that you've managed to find me,
what do you want?

There was something I was excited
to show you, but now I don't want to.

- I'm okay with that.
- So am I.

Oh, come on. You gotta see this.

All right. Fine.

Hey. Wait a minute.

Did Berta know you were out here?

Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid.

Oh, you bought a Porsche.

"Porsche." What do you think?

It's cute.

What do you mean, cute?

I mean, it looks like my car's
hot little girlfriend.

Are you saying this is a chick car?
Because it isn't. It's a Porsche.

Yeah. The cute little one.

No, no, no. It's the sporty one.

If your sport is girls' basketball.

No, no, it's got the fuel injection,
and the rack and the pinion...

...and the leather thingy
to cover the hood.

That's called a bra, Alan.

Yeah, but it's made of leather.

- All right. Whatever.
- It is not a chick car.

The salesman showed me brochures
with pictures of guys driving it.

Alan, if a monkey walked
into the dealership...

...he'd have been shown
pictures of monkeys driving it.

Monkeys can't drive a stick.

Now, come on.
We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake.

Where'd you get the money for this?

Where'd you get it...

...because they're not cheap.
- No, no, they are not.

Where'd you get the money for this?

The money. Where'd you get it?

Oh, I got it from...

- What?
- I got a loan from...

Alan, where'd the money come from?

I found it.

- Alan?
- Mom.

You traded your soul for a Porsche.

I didn't trade my soul,
and it's "Porsche."

Alan, why didn't you come to me?

No, I already owe you so much.

You won't let me pay rent
and you pay all the utilities.

Keeping that in mind,
did you ever consider...

...taking the money from Mom
and paying me back?

No, not really.

Come on. Let me show you
what this baby can do.

Well, what do you know?
Monkeys can drive a stick.

You know, the salesman was right.

You really do feel special
in one of these things.

Oh, yeah. Probably not a lot
of middle-aged, divorced guys...

...driving around L.A. In a Porsche.

"Porsche."

Oh, wait, I forgot to show you
the best part.

Alan, that's a NASCAR hat.

Yeah, they were
out of the Porsche hats.

I wanted something that said speed
and performance, so I got this.

What you should be wearing
is a hat with a propeller on top.

Come on, open her up.

The first 1000 miles
is the break-in period.

You're not supposed to go over 65.

Well, then go 65.

The speed limit is 60.
You want me to get a ticket?

Alan, you're driving
an expensive red sports car.

If you're not getting tickets and tail,
you might as well take the bus.

Which, by the way, just passed us.

I am going plenty fast,
thank you very much.

Can we at least put the top down?

No, I wanna trap the new-car smell in
as long as I can.

Man, are you anal-retentive.

You need a bumper sticker that reads,
"My other car is a puckered rectum."

Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this car
with a bumper sticker.

God, I love that sound.

Will you stop it?

Jake, your dad's here.
Where's your car?

Oh, my car? My car is...

...right there.

- You got a Porsche?
- "Porsche."

I have to struggle to make ends meet,
and you can buy a Porsche?

What are you talking about?
Your ends have not only met...

...they've been to Hawaii
and remodeled the kitchen.

Don't change the subject.
How can you afford a fancy car?

Well, I can't afford it, really.

Maybe I have to call my attorney.

And re-examine our whole
alimony/child-support agreement.

No, no, you don't.

It wasn't very expensive.

This is the girl version. Right, Charlie?

Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss it
before you can even stick the key in.

Judith, you have nothing to worry about.
You've successfully sucked me dry.

Absolutely. This guy's farting dust.

Then where'd he get
the money for the car?

He borrowed it from our mother.

Give me a break.
Even Alan's not that stupid.

Oh, but he is.

I am. I swear to God.

- Hey, cool car. Is it yours?
- Yeah.

We're gonna have to talk
about my allowance.

Okay, well, have a nice weekend.

Wait a minute. That's a two-seater.
Where's he gonna sit?

And you didn't believe
he was that stupid.

We're going way over
the speed limit.

Let me worry about that.
You just keep looking for cops.

I don't usually take a cab.

I drive a red Boxster.
You know, Porsche.

- Those are very nice.
- Thank you.

My sister has one.

- Hey, Berta. You seen my brother?
- Did you check his room?

Thanks.

Sweetie, it is a beautiful car.
Congratulations.

- Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it.
- Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers.

Berta, have you seen Charlie?

Look out on the deck.

- I was looking for you.
- I was in the garage.

- I was looking for you.
- I was looking for Alan.

I was in the garage.

Okay. Bye.

Oh, sure. Blame the maid.

Oh, Alan, before I forget,
I need to ask you for a little favor.

Your soul, please.

Charlie, for God's sake...

Careful. I don't think
you're allowed to say "God"...

...without bursting into flames
or something.

Shush with your antichrist humor.

It's getting old.

Alan, I'd like you to join me
for dinner tomorrow night.

- Why?
- I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet.

And?

He has a lovely daughter about your age.

Sayeth the serpent.

No. Mom, please, please,
please, no blind dates.

Why not? She's a sweet girl
and I think you might really hit it off.

- Why can't Charlie go out with her?
- Hey, she didn't buy me a car.

This has absolutely nothing
to do with the car.

Besides, I want
to get closer to this man.

Should the time come
when I want an ugly breakup...

...I'll let you
take a crack at his daughter.

I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not.

Alan, I bought you a car.

I love the smell of brimstone
in the morning.

Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir.

- I really appreciate this, darling.
- Sure.

Oh, one more thing. She's been
through a rough patch lately...

...so we won't be ordering alcohol.

Bye-bye.

No, really. She sounds great.

Looks like my mom and your dad
are running a little late.

Typical.

Yeah. So you're in town
for the weekend. Where do you live?

Palm Springs.

That's nice.
How long have you lived there?

Forty-two days, so far.

Forty-two days?

Yeah. This is my first weekend pass.

I was supposed to get one at 30,
but I bit a guy.

- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, no, no cocktails. No.

- No, that's all right. You can have one.
- No, I'm fine.

- Oh, please. Go ahead.
- No. I don't think...

Order a drink, damn it.
I wanna smell it.

We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water.

So, what do you do?

I'm a chiropractor.

Really? Can you prescribe stuff?

No.

Did you hear that?

- It's my phone.
- Oh, thank God.

Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you?

Yes, she's here.

Yes, very sweet. Where are you?

Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking.

Oh, that's just great.
Just jim-freaking-dandy.

You guys are coming, right?
Well, what am I supposed to do?

Yes, I know you bought me a car.

All right, all right. All right. Goodbye.

Apparently, your father mixed up
his heart pills with his Viagra...

...and they didn't wanna
waste the opportunity.

So he's not coming?

Well...

Perfect. Just perfect.

That son of a bitch
never cared about me.

Trudy, Trudy...

He'd rather spend the night
with some old hose bag.

That old hose bag is my mother...

...and there's still no smoking in here.
I'm sorry.

Careful. I bit the last guy
who tried to touch me.

Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
we can't have a nice meal.

I'll call the waiter.

Hello, hello.
Yeah, we're ready to order.

Remind me to get some clean urine
from you before we go.

- Two hundred forty pounds...
- What are you doing?

Picking off the pepperonis.

Then why'd you order it
with pepperonis?

I like to stack them up
and eat them in bed.

Hello? Hey, Mom.

No, Dad's not here. He's on a date.

Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me.
Yeah?

Don't tell your mom
your father's on a date.

- It's none of her business.
- Okay.

He's not on a date.

Hang on. She wants to talk to you.

Uncle Charlie's not here.

Give me that.

Hey, Judith. What's up?

Well, he's not a bright kid.
What do you want from me?

I don't know where Alan is.

Would you like me
to give him a message?

Because who knows?
Maybe this time I will.

No message.

How come it's a secret
Dad's on a date?

It's not. It's just never a good idea to tell
women more than they need to know.

How come?

Because we love them
and want to protect them.

A clueless woman is a happy woman.

- Can I have your pepperonis?
- No.

Batman!

Come on. Come on, Trudy.
Come on. Come on.

- Let's get you back to the Batcave...
- Oh, right.

...or whatever cave
you crawled out of.

Thank you, kind sir.
You are indeed a gentleman.

Allow me to reward you.

A salty! I shall now need a slice of lime
and a carafe of tequila.

No, thank you. No, no, we're fine.

Hey, come on, Trudy.
Let's take you home.

Okay. But we'll have to be
really quiet...

...because my roommate is detoxing,
so she's kind of a light sleeper.

No, no, I meant home to your father.

Oh, God.

Daddy!

Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you.

Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it.

So why is Dad's car a chick car?

It's not really. I was just saying that
to bust his chops.

Chops are your nuts, right?

Right.

Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car.

Well, she was bound to be right
about something eventually.

What's a midlife crisis?

Well, Jake, it's when a man
starts facing his own mortality...

...and tries to recapture his youth.

I've had one of those.

Do tell.

Life was so much simpler
when I was 6.

Hello? Hey, Dad.

Listen, don't worry
about your midlife crisis.

They usually go away
over summer vacation.

He wants to talk to you.
Are you here?

Yeah. Whoa, slow down.

Well, how drunk is she?

Really? Batman drunk?

Well, just dump her
with Mom and her father.

Where are they?

Viagra and a bad ticker.

Mom loses more boyfriends that way.

Alan, calm down, calm down.
Listen to me. Here's what you do:

Take her to a club...

...pin a warning note on her back
as a courtesy to the next guy...

...and run like hell.

Well, if you don't want my advice,
why'd you call me?

Okay, how about this:

Put the top down
and let the night air sober her up.

What's plan B?

How come you don't have
a date tonight?

I decided I'd rather hang out with you.

- Really?
- No.

You're saying that to bust my chops.

No.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- How was your date?
- Oh, lots of fun.

- Think you'll marry her?
- Doubtful. Charlie?

What happened?
You take her to a club and ditch her?

- No, I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

Well, it's cheesy and immoral...

...and I'm really not comfortable
having some valet touch my car.

- So where is she?
- In the garage.

- Oh, Alan.
- Well, she passed out.

- I figured I'd let her sleep it off.
- You left her in your car?

Why not?

Well, at least she left
the garage door open.

It's a red Porsche Boxster
with dealer plates.

"Porsche."
Yeah, about an hour ago.

Hey, Dad, check it out.
Your car's on TV.

I'll call you back.

- chase so far. The suspect was
first spotted in Malibu...

... on the Pacific Coast Highway...

... and is now southbound
on the 405 freeway.

Oh, God!

Don't worry. I've watched
hundreds of these. They never make it.

- she just ran over the nail strips
that the Highway Patrol laid out.

Oh, man, look at the sparks.

That's because
she's riding on rims, Jake.

You gotta like
how your car handles without tires.

Oh, God!

Whoa, that was a close call.

She sideswiped that SUV
and kept right on going.

What's that dragging
alongside Dad's car?

I think that's the door.

- Cool.
- Oh, God!

Dale, this is Trish in the studio.
Can you see the suspect?

How do you know it's a woman?

Well, Trish, we actually
don 't know it's a woman...

... but thought it was a safe bet
based on the type of car.

It's not a chick car.

Relax, Dad.
He's just busting your chops.

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandma
about your spring break.

- Bad idea.
- What?

Nothing. I just saw that they're moving
the L.A. Gardening Exposition...

...to the Convention Center,
which I think is a very bad idea.

Thanks for the update.
Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma.

- It was really cool, l...
- Hang on a second, Jake.

I'm not sure you understand
how serious this gardening thing is.

It's a really bad idea.

I get it. Bad idea.

Go ahead, Jake.

I went camping
with Grandma and Grandpa.

We slept in a tent,
we cooked on an open fire.

And we went hiking and saw a bear.

You let him spend an entire vacation
with his other grandparents...

...and I haven't had him for a night?

Oh, bad idea.

This is unfair and unacceptable.

From the moment
that boy was born...

...Judith's parents squeezed me out.
And you let them.

Interesting point.

Excuse me, Mom,
but when Jake was born...

...Judith's mother stayed with us,
cooking and cleaning...

...and taking care of him.
- Valid counterpoint.

Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman.

Personal opinion.

No, no. You went on a cruise.

But Judith was two days late.

And I had nonrefundable reservations.

Like it would have killed her
to get a C-section.

Self-obsessed psychotic rant.

- Mom, are you listening to yourself?
- Stupid question.

Awkward silence.

You wanna spend more time
with your grandson, he's right here.

No. He goes to visit
his other grandparents.

He should come to visit me.

- So you wanna spend a week with him?
- A week?

Alan, I do have a life.

I'm confused.
What exactly do you want?

The same quality time Jake spends
with his other grandparents.

But, you know, less.

I'll tell you what. Bring him
to my place around 6-ish tonight.

I'll make him dinner,
we'll have a fun sleepover.

- Gee, Mom, I don't know.
- Well, why not?

Are you afraid one night with me
will irreparably damage him?

- Yeah.
- A little.

Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaints
when I was raising you two.

The teenage drinking and constant
running away wasn't a slight tip-off?

Oh, you were just
a little drama queen, Charlie.

And let's not forget,
you always came back.

Kind of hard to find steady work
when you're 9.

Whatever. My place, 6-ish.

Judith! I can't just leave him with you
without discussing it with his mother.

Are you telling me you need to get
your ex-wife's approval...

...to let your own son spend time
with your own mother?

He had a really bad lawyer.

You know what your problem is, Alan.
You let women walk all over you.

You get that from your father.

Well, nevertheless,
I still have to clear it with Judith.

- Well, fine, call her.
- Right now?

Well, why not?
Unless you'd rather I make the call.

Probably not home. I'll just...
I'll leave a message.

Yeah. Hi, Judith.

Listen, it's Alan.
Call me back when you get a chance.

Hello? Oh, hi, Judith,
you old call-screener, you.

Listen, I just wanted
to run something past you.

Jake was telling my mom about
the fun time he had with your parents...

...and she thought that...

What do you mean, "no"?
I haven't even asked yet.

Oh, really?
Well, I've got news for you, lady.

You can't say no,
she's his grandmother.

Well, she may be that too...

...but she's still his grandmother
and this is my weekend with him.

Charlie and I turned out fine.

We did too.

Look, he's going, and that's that.

All right then, goodbye.

- It's settled. He'll be there at 6.
- Thank you.

Of course, it is rather short notice.

- Mom!
- Okay. Fine.

But don't get used to this.

I'm not your full-time babysitter.

I played that wrong, didn't I?

No, no. You called mom's bluff
and you stood up to your ex-wife.

You maintained your self-respect,
I'm proud of you.

- Yeah, but what about Jake?
- Oh, Jake.

Jake's screwed.

This has been the greatest day of
my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade.

Well, that's good.
I wanted today to be special.

- How come?
- Just because I love you.

I love you too, Dad.

You know how people say
you can't buy love?

I think they're wrong.

You hold on to that sentiment.

What's the plan for tonight?
Is it gonna be special too?

Oh, God, I can't watch this.

- What?
- Nothing.

Oh, hey, here's $20.

Wow, thanks.

- You're spending tonight at Grandma's.
- Great. Wait, what?

You're gonna have lots of fun.

- Right, Charlie?
- This is the first I'm hearing of it.

I don't want to go to Grandma's.
Here, take your money.

Come on, buddy.
She loves you very much.

And it's just for one night.

But we were having so much fun.

Think it through, Jake.
Why were you having so much fun?

- You tricked me.
- Attaboy.

What did I ever do to you?

It's not a punishment.

It's not a prize.

- I'm calling Mom.
- No. No, no calling Mom.

I know my rights. I get one phone call.

- I've already told your mother.
- She agreed?

She knows about it.

Uncle Charlie,
can you get me out of this?

It depends. Are you willing to live
in Mexico for a few years?

Jake, please. Do it as a favor
to your grandmother, who loves you.

For me. For Uncle Charlie.

But most of all, for me.

What do I get?

What do you mean?
I spent a fortune on you today.

That was because you love me.
Now you need me.

Oh, God, this is a great kid.

Okay. What do you want?

A motorized Razor scooter,
the new Dragon Ball Z game...

...an iPod mini
and not to go to Grandma's.

- I'll give you three out of four.
- Okay.

Forget the iPod.

- This is the worst day of my life.
- Come on.

You're gonna eat your dinner,
watch some videos, play some games...

...and you're gonna go to bed and
we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise.

Your word means nothing to me.

Hey, give your dad a break.
So he lied.

You don't get the virgin to the volcano
by telling her you're gonna push her in.

- Can't we just go home?
- No. Now, enough of this.

- I am the adult and you are the child.
- And this is the volcano.

Now, you're gonna go in there
and you're gonna have a nice evening.

- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.

Thank you. Now, ring the bell.

So exactly what time are you...? Hey!

We've done a terrible thing.

Yeah. If only there was a magical liquid
that could erase bad memories.

I am absolutely racked with guilt.

Alan, don't beat yourself up.

You're a good dad who, in a moment
of weakness, betrayed his only son.

Come on, he's not in any real danger.

Not physically,
but you know as well I do...

...that Mom has the ability
to say things that stick with you.

Yeah, forever and ever.

My favorite was, " They must have
mixed you up with another baby...

...because I could never have given birth
to such a hateful child."

Who writes that on
a fifth-grader's birthday card?

How about, " It's no wonder
your father stays at work.

If I could get out of here,
I would too."

Did I ever tell you about the time
I wrote my first jingle?

Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watch
the prime-time network debut.

For 30 seconds, 20 million people
were listening to my music.

And at the end,
Mom turned to me and said:

"You couldn't get Coke to hire you?"

- Nice. But I can top it.
- Go.

It's the day of my wedding.
She's sitting there crying.

And I think it's because she's happy.

Turns out it was because she was,
and I quote:

"So relieved you finally found
someone who could love you."

- We gotta go get Jake.
- You're right. Come on.

Great game, ladies.

- He'll be fine.
- Who?

- Jake.
- Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

- Who?
- Jake.

He'll be fine.

I thought we'd eat Japanese-style.

Good Lord, are you picking your nose?

I had to. There was stuff in it.

And where were you planning
to put it?

I really didn't have a plan.

Don't you dare wipe that
on my furniture.

And not on your clothes either.

- What are you doing now?
- Putting it back.

Here, just wipe your hands.

- Why?
- Because we're going to eat dinner.

And you've been rooting around
in your nostril.

It's okay. I don't eat with my hands.
I use a fork.

- Wipe your hands.
- Okay.

Thank you.

Has your mother or father
ever taken you out for sushi?

No. I don't like raw fish.

- Well, have you ever had it?
- No.

How do you know you don't like it?

It's an educated guess.

Well, why don't you just try it.

Let's start with the tuna, shall we?
There you go.

That's not tuna.

Oh, yes, it is.

I've had tuna.

Jake, it's tuna.

Now, why don't you just take
a little bite. Here.

Dip it in the soy sauce first.

There you go. Have a bite.

You know, there's a girl at school,
Elizabeth Kurzner...

...and her mom ate a bunch of sushi,
and it had worms.

And they grew in her
and crawled out of her eyes.

- Oh, no, they didn't.
- How do you know?

- Just take a little bite.
- Okay.

- Jake!
- It's gross. It tastes like worms.

Jake, stop spitting on my rug.

- Where do you want me to spit?
- Don't spit at all.

- I gotta get the taste out.
- Have some ginger.

- No, Jake, that's wasabi.
- What?

Are you trying to kill me?

No, Jake, don't.
That's an expensive pillow.

Let... Give me that!

Okay, here.

I've just gotta ask.

Playing volleyball on the beach every day,
don't you worry about melanoma?

Alan, walk with me.

Be right back.

- What?
- Listen closely:

No man has ever gotten into a woman's
pants chitchatting about skin cancer.

You can't possibly know that.

Nevertheless.

Let's steer the conversation away
from tumors, okay?

- Okay. So which one do you like?
- One?

God, in his infinite wisdom, has given us
a big box of assorted chocolates...

...and you're just gonna try one?

So are you thinking, like, two?

I was thinking, like, nine.

- But we'll see what happens.
- You're not serious.

His will be done.

What else do we have to eat?

You mean other than the $50 worth
of sushi in my carpet?

Yeah.

- I don't suppose you'd eat squab.
- No.

- Do you even know what it is?
- No.

But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab."

Well, what would you eat?

Pretty much anything,
except sushi and squab.

Squab, squab.

Squab, squab, squab,
squab, squab, squab...

- Stop it.
- Sorry.

Squab.

Would you eat spaghetti?

- I love spaghetti.
- Great.

Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine?

Spaghetti.

All right. What would you like on it?

Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese,
olive oil with truffles?

How about squab?

I'm just kidding. Ketchup.

- Of course.
- And sliced-up hot dogs.

Unbelievable.
My grandson is a hillbilly.

You know, I'm thinking we should
move this party over to my place.

But we've been playing
volleyball all day.

We're all sweaty and sticky.

No problem.
Mi shower es su shower.

- What?
- I have a shower.

- Good. You live alone?
- Pretty much.

My brother stays with me and he's got
a kid, but he's at his grandmother's.

Oh, that is so sweet.

Yeah, well, we're sweet people.

I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

- Is that so?
- Yeah.

I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

Oh, yeah.
She was a big influence on me.

She raised me. I called her Nana.

Oh, Jake, what have we done to you?

Dinner, such as it is, is served.

Jake? Where are you?
Come into the dining room!

Squab!

Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid.

What kid?

Your kid. Our kid. I think we should
go to Mom's and get him.

Oh, come on, he's fine.
And it's just for one night.

Which, by the way, is rapidly becoming
one of the best nights of my life.

And grind, and grind.
And step and step and turn.

Alan. Alan, please.

Hey, if you're worried,
why don't you call.

And grind, and grind.
And grind and grind and grind.

- What's her number?
- You don't have her on speed dial?

Hey, if I can't eat it, bang it
or bet on it, it's not in my phone.

It's ringing.

And grind, and grind.
And I'm a lucky boy.

Hello? Mom?

I can't talk to you now, Charlie.

Get that out of your mouth.
Are you an animal?

Mom? Hello? Hello?

And grind, and grind.
And step and step and...

You don't understand, Charlie.

It was a women's volleyball team
and I could've been the volleyball.

- Get your priorities straight, will you?
- I've got my priorities straight.

I've had a kid for 11 years,
but I've never had group sex.

Alan, you didn't miss anything.
It's an overrated male fantasy.

- Really?
- No, are you kidding?

He'd better be scarred for life.

- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

What happened? Where's Jake?

I sent him up to take a bath.

He had hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair.

Why would he have hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair?

Because he wouldn't eat squab.

Squab.

- What are you guys doing here?
- We wanted to see how things were.

- They're okay.
- See, he's fine.

- Let's go back to the bar.
- And take me with you.

- Jake?
- Yeah?

Did you turn the water off
in the bathtub?

- Say goodbye to Grandma.
- Goodbye, Grandma.

Night, Mom.

You realize that in one night,
he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime.

He broke her.

He chewed her up and spit her out.

It was a beautiful thing.

I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan.

I always thought your kid
was a little bit of a simpleton.

Me too.

But clearly, he is the chosen one.

Hey, guys, check it out.

Pull my finger.

Okay.

And they shall call him Jake.

.......... ********** ..........

That was very nice, Mindy.

Okay.

Jake, we're ready to hear your report.

- Jake?
- Just a sec.

Now, Jake.

Okay, I'm finished.

- Does spelling and grammar count?
- It's an oral report, Jake.

Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer.

Right.

Good thing it's not a rectal report.

- Just read it.
- Okay.

"My Weekend, by Jake Harper.

Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class.

Woodward Avenue Elementary School,
located on Woodward Avenue."

I'm not counting words.

Oh, good.

"My weekend starts on Friday, when
my mom takes me to my dad's house.

Which is actually
my Uncle Charlie's house.

Who is my dad's brother,
making him my uncle.

His name is Charlie, which is why
I call him my Uncle Charlie."

Anyway...

"Even though my parents are divorced,
they still get along."

- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

- How was your week?
- Just fine.

- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Mom.

- Thanks for bringing him.
- Bite me. What the hell...

...went on last weekend?
- What are you talking about?

When I brought him home Sunday
night and served him dinner...

...he tipped me with a $25 chip
from Caesars Palace...

...and told me I had a nice rack.

Well, Judith...

...you do.

That's not the point.

Where'd he get the chip?
Where is he learning this behavior?

Hey, Judith.

Looking good.

Run away, run away.

Did you give my son a $25 chip?

- No, I did not give him a $25 chip.
- Happy?

He won it, fair and square.

You couldn't run away.

I don't care what you do on weekdays.

But on weekends, remember you are
a role model for an 11 -year-old boy.

Oh, that's a bad idea.
Who thought of that?

I'm warning you. Things had better
change or there will be consequences.

Legal consequences. Got it?

- Got it.
- Goodbye.

"There will be serious consequences.

Legal consequences."

"I don't care what you do
during the week.

But on the weekends,
you're a role model."

I enjoy talking this way.

As do I.

"Friday night, I stayed up late.

I watched all three Austin Power
movies with my dad.

We ate Chinese food
and Buffalo wings.

Dad fell asleep during
The Spy Who Shagged Me...

...which, in my opinion,
is the strongest of the trilogy.

By the way,
'shag' means 'sex' in England."

Just read, Jake.

That was a footnote.

- Read.
- Okay.

"I woke up later with a stomachache...

...but felt better after
I went to the bathroom."

If you know what I mean.

- Jake.
- What? It's not like I said:

"I took a dump."

"Anyway, I tried to go back to sleep
but I couldn 't.

Probably because I was thirsty.

So I went into the kitchen for what
Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. '

But really it's just a glass
of orange juice.

It was late, so I decided
to skip the glass."

Jake?

Hang on.

That one hurt a little.

- What you doing?
- Having a virgin screwdriver.

- Want some?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

- What are you doing?
- Watching TV.

Why isn't it on?

Because I've seen this one already.

- Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke?
- Sure.

Why did the blond stare
at the juice carton?

I don't know. Why?

"Cause the carton said
'concentrate.'"

That's okay. I didn't get it either.

"The next morning
I was pretty hungry because..."

I think you all know why.

"So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad,
and we made plans for the day."

- You wanna go to the museum?
- No. I wanna watch TV.

It's pretty windy out there.
Wanna fly a kite?

No. I wanna watch TV.

- Hiking?
- TV.

- I'll get it.
- TV.

"We decided to watch TV."

- Hello.
- Is your name Harper?

- Yes.
- Then this is for you.

- Why'd you do that?
- Why did you sleep with my wife?

Charlie.

Busy.

I don't care. Open the door.

- I've got company.
- I know.

And her husband's downstairs.

Really?

- You're married?
- Yeah.

I'm not in.

You have to come and deal with him.

- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

I disagree.

It's not up for debate.
He knows you're here.

Oh, man, I hate when this happens.

This happens a lot?

Not a lot, but enough to be a drag.

Charlie, are you coming back to bed?

- Yes.
- Yes? No "yes."

There is an angry husband
in your living room.

How angry?

- Is he packing?
- What?

- Does he have a weapon?
- L... He has a stick.

That's not good.
I could lose an eye.

- Charlie! Come on.
- Fine, I'll wrap it up here.

- Give me 20 minutes.
- Oh, no.

A better idea. Wrap it up now.

- Ten minutes?
- Now.

We got five minutes.

"The weekend was going great, but then
something really bad happened."

- Hey.
- Hello.

- Who are you?
- I'm Norman.

I'm Jake.
Have you seen my Game Boy?

No. Have you seen my wife?

No. Well, if you see it, let me know.

Ditto.

"I couldn 't believe it.

I lost my Game Boy."

"I couldn't find my Game Boy
in the kitchen or living room...

...so I checked my bedroom
and my bathroom.

Because, as you may recall, I'd spent
a lot of time in there the night before."

- He'll be right down.
- Thank you.

Can I get you a cup of coffee?

Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged.

Well, that's certainly understandable.

I have cookies too.

- I wouldn't say no to a cookie.
- Good. Come on in the kitchen.

I always find a nice cookie
can brighten up even the darkest day.

Yeah, well, this better be
one hell of a cookie.

- It's a nice house you got here.
- Oh, thank you.

Actually, it belongs to my...

You live in the neighborhood?

- Bel-Air.
- Oh, that's nice too.

Gated community,
but the wife gets out anyway.

Chews through her leash, huh?

Hey, let me get you that cookie.

You see like a nice fella.
I'm sorry I hit you with my stick.

Oh, that's okay.
I'm sorry my brother is...

That's okay.

So women, huh?

Can't live with them.

That's all I got.

- You married?
- Divorced.

- She sleep around?
- No, mostly just slept.

You're lucky.

There's no pain greater than being
betrayed by the woman you love.

You know, these are really very tasty.

Aren't they?

- Good morning.
- Oh, speaking of tasty cookies...

...Norman, this is Berta.

- Hello.
- What is this, a fix-up?

No, no. Nothing like that.

That's good,
because I'd probably kill him.

Nothing personal, Cotton Top.
I just kind of like it rough.

- Have another cookie.
- Thank you.

So is anybody gonna tell me
what's going on?

Well, it's a little complicated.

- Charlie...
- Got it.

Got it? How could you get it?

There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway...

...and I found these
hanging on the mailbox...

...so I'm guessing that your brother's
got some bimbo upstairs...

...and Norman here is her daddy
or her sugar daddy.

- Tell me I'm wrong.
- I'm the husband.

Judges?

- You gotta give it to her.
- Yes.

- I mean, tough break.
- Thank you.

- You got a gun?
- No!

- Want one?
- Berta!

I'm making small talk.

Okay.

You wanna talk this out like gentlemen,
or you...?

You might've mentioned
he fought at the Alamo.

- No offense.
- None taken.

- Does that make us even?
- You tell me.

Okay. One more.

How about that?

- He poked you, you poked his...
- Berta!

What? How often do you see
that kind of symmetry in life?

Hey.

Hello.

Were you just up in
Uncle Charlie's room?

- Yeah.
- Did you see my Game Boy?

No.

- Did you see my husband?
- The old guy?

- Yeah.
- He's in the kitchen.

Thanks.

Well, that's weird.

If I was a Game Boy,
where would I be?

I am so sorry.
I had no idea that she was married.

I have a firm rule when it comes
to sleeping with married women.

Yeah, if she's firm enough,
he'll do her.

Sorry. Isn't there something
you could clean?

I'm guessing you could
use a good scrubbing.

Wait a minute.

"And suddenly I realized...

...I might have left it
in my mom's car."

Hey, Mom, did I leave
my Game Boy in your car?

Well, can you go look?

Can't you just dry off
and put on a robe?

There's another $25 chip in it for you.

She wasn't wearing a ring.
There was no mention of a husband.

Is that supposed to cheer me up?

- No, no, no. I just wanted you to know...
- Now, now. I get it.

You're a nice guy,
and I married a skeevy tramp.

No, no, no.
I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy...

...but I'm sure Annette
is a lovely woman.

Her name is Natalie.

- Really? You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

Because I've been yelling
"Annette" all night.

Her name is Natalie.

Well, then maybe this is all
just a huge misunderstanding...

...and I've been upstairs
doing someone else's wife.

Five-foot six, long brown hair,
butterfly tattoo on her left hip.

Left hip, huh?

Hold on now.
A lot of women have butterfly tattoos.

But the one I slept with also had a little
beauty mark in a certain intimate place.

I'm not here to claim a lost wallet.

Okay, let's just assume it's her.
Again, I am really sorry.

It's my own fault anyway.

I should've realized
back when I married her...

...a man my age couldn't satisfy
a woman that young.

If it makes you feel any better,
I couldn't ring her bell, either.

- You couldn't?
- You don't know me...

...but there's things I don't kid about.

So it's not just me.

- That's a relief.
- Tell me...

...about it.
I was killing myself up there.

So anyway...

...are we okay?

You mean, aside from the fact
that you just rolled off my wife?

Oh, yeah. We're aces.

Good. Thank you.

- Can I give you a little advice, kid?
- Sure.

I was a player once, like you.

Do tell.

Does the name Tuesday Weld
mean anything to you?

No.

Joey Heatherton?

No.

The immortal Miss Anne Francis.

TV's Honey West.

- Sorry.
- Well, look them up on your Internet.

They were all hot, and I nailed them.

Really. Well, kudos.

But nothing lasts forever.

There's going to come a time
when you'll wanna settle down.

And I only hope you don't make
the same mistake I did.

I picked a young hottie...

...because I figured I'd die in the sack
with a smile on my face.

That's my retirement plan.

But it doesn't work that way.

What happens is...

...you get your heart broken...

...and you wind up having
coffee with some putz...

...who never heard of Honey West.

Got it.

Thanks for the advice.

Well, I'll be getting home now.

I got lawyers to call, locks to change.

Maybe I'll stop at the market,
pick up some of those cookies.

- Here. Take the box.
- Oh, thanks.

Looks like I'm the big winner
around here today.

- Hello? Anybody home?
- Hello.

- Hello. Who are you?
- Norman.

Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn.

Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royce
out in the drive?

Why, yes, it is.

- Are you a friend of Charlie's?
- No.

But my wife is.

Did my son polish your trophy wife?

Well, you seem
like a very intelligent man.

I assume you had an airtight prenup.

Bulletproof.

You know what, Norman?

You look a lot like my fifth husband.

Really?
How many times you been married?

Four.

Cookie?

"When Grandma came over,
I thought things couldn't get any worse.

But instead of making me visit...

...she gave my dad money to take me,
my uncle and Berta to the movies.

We saw the Rob Schneider movie
where he plays a stupid guy.

I had popcorn, nachos
and two jumbo red Slurpees.

But as you know,
you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them."

- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Cool your jets.

And if you can't cool them,
point the nozzle away from me.

Oh, God. Mom!

- We can't go in right now.
- Why not?

Because I can't afford to send you
to therapy for the rest of your life.

What's going on?

- Oh, God!
- What? What, what, what?

Good for Norman.
That's getting right back on the horse.

- There's a horse in there?
- No, no. No horse.

- Well, I still have to pee.
- So go water that bush over there.

"And so I did.
And it just goes to show...

...it's always
in the last place you look."

Very nice, Jake.

"Then on Sunday,
we all went out for breakfast...

...with Grandma and Uncle Norman.

I had chocolate-chip pancakes
with blueberry syrup and bacon.

Dad had scrambled eggs
but with no yolks. Just the whites.

They looked like mashed potatoes.

Then the kid next to us threw up
his waffles. It was awesome."

- So, what's new in school?
- Almost got an A on my paper.

What do you mean "almost"?

Got a C.

Okay, that's... That's fine.
That's an improvement.

Minus.

Still, here's your dollar.

You're paying him for a C-minus?

That was our deal. A buck for every C,
a car for every A.

- A car?
- Safest bet in the world.

- So, what was the report about?
- What we did last weekend.

- No kidding?
- Yeah. And guess what else happened.

Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous rat
in the cafeteria.

Yeah, but about the paper.

You wrote about everything
that happened here last weekend?

Well, everything but the boring stuff.

Oh, this could be problematic.

No, it's called "summarizing."

- Can I see it?
- Sure.

But it's at Mom's house.
I gave it to her to read this weekend.

He's 11.
There's no way it stands up in court.

Does this smell funny to you?

.......... ********** ..........

I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom...

...but I have a strict policy
against blind dates.

Yes, I know I'm not God's gift
to women, but nevertheless.

Oh, come on, how do you know what
she can suck through a garden hose?

It doesn't matter, the policy stands.

Okay, bye.

You know, while I applaud
your blind date policy...

...I would encourage you to consider
a garden hose exemption.

I'm sorry, but you remember
the last time I let Mom fix me up.

Oh, yeah, the enema freak.

She was a colonic irrigation therapist.

Tomato, tomahto.

You still wound up with five gallons
of coffee up your keister.

Not a pleasant memory.

Oh, I can't remember it
without chuckling.

These days they'll open
a Starbucks anywhere.

-Are you done?
-No, wait, one more.

You had the Venti nonfat
crap-puccino...

...with extra foam.

No, okay, I'm done.

So, what's wrong with the TV?

The storm last night messed up the
satellite dish. I'll call the guy on Monday.

That's your answer for everything.
"Call the guy. "

Not for everything.
Often, I'll call the girl.

Of course there was the one time
that the girl turned out to be the guy.

Needless to say,
I got a full cash refund.

You don't have to call
the guy this time.

You adjust the dish
till the signal clears up.

Which is what the guy
will do on Monday.

But Jake is coming tonight.

Do you wanna listen to him complain
about the TV all weekend?

I can deal with Jake. It's your whining
that makes me wanna hang myself.

Come on, help me get the ladder.

I'll go up on the roof
and we'll fix it in five minutes.

I have a ladder?

How did I get a ladder?

For the life of me,
I can't remember buying a ladder.

Well, apparently you did.

But why?

-And how did I get it home?
-I really couldn't tell you.

Did I rent a truck?

Who knows?

I'm telling you,
we got a real mystery on our hands.

Yeah, it's a puzzler.

Now, I'm gonna go up
and adjust the dish...

...and you go look at the TV
and tell me when the picture improves.

All right.

I still think we should call the guy.

Will you forget the guy?

I'm the guy.

-Charlie.
-Yeah?

There's a pair of panties up here.

Of course, the ladder.

-Alan, mystery solved.
-What?

Never mind. Focus on the job at hand.

-Are you watching the TV?
-Y es.

How does it look now?

It's a little better.

How about now?

No, no, no. That's worse.

-Move it the other way.
-What?

I said, move it the other way.

-There, there, there. That's perfect.
-What?

I said that's perfect.

Great. Coming down.

Did you say something?

I told you.
We should have called the guy.

Oh, you wanna flip me the bird,
but the poor little fellow can't fly.

Just help me lie down.

-There is a bright side here, you know.
-Oh, really?

Really? And what might the
bright side be? Handicapped parking?

Pity sex?

You know, I can see there's gonna be
no talking to you about this.

Oh, do me a favor and call Judith
and tell her not to bring Jake over.

How come?

Look at me, Charlie.

I have abrasions, contusions,
a severely sprained neck...

...two fractured fingers,
and I'm hopped up on pain pills.

Does that spell weekend dad to you?

Actually, to me it spells:

"Weekend in Bangkok
with two Olympic gymnasts. "

But that's a whole other story.

Look, I got no plans for the weekend.
I could take care of Jake.

-Bangkok?
-lt was the '80s.

A simpler time.

The dollar was strong.

I was looking forward to hanging out
with the knucklehead.

Let him come over.

I can't help you.
What will you do all weekend?

I don't know.
Hey, maybe I'll get a chute.

We could play Chutes and Ladders.

You see. See, that's why I want Jake
here. He has a sense of humor.

Oh, all right.
If you think you can handle it.

Don't worry,
I got everything covered.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Is there anything I can do
for you now?

Well, I gotta pee.

Yeah, so?

So I can't undo my pants...

...or anything.

Where are we headed with this, Alan?

You said you'd help me.

I was thinking like
I could make you a sandwich.

-Charlie!
-Hey, I am not reaching into your pants.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Go stand in the surf.

Come on, grow up.

-Where are you going?
-T o the bathroom.

Now, come on and unzip me.

Just like that? Right to it?
No dinner? No movie?

Charlie!

Hold on.

Coming.

Holy God.

Charlie, can you get the door?

Charlie?

Hang on.

Charlie!

Oh, great,
I think I just punctured a lung.

"Don't worry, Alan.
I've got everything covered. "

I'm coming.

You need to start your report
this weekend.

Why?
It's not due till next Wednesday.

-I've plenty of time.
-You said that last time.

-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

I think you're getting senile.

Watch your mouth, young man.

I can't watch it. It's under my nose.

-Hello.
-What happened to you?

Well, most recently,
I was hit in the head by a door.

But before that, I was fixing
the satellite dish on the roof...

...and I kind of fell.

Why didn't you just call the guy?

For God's sake, Alan, how do you intend
to look after him this weekend?

I am in excruciating pain,
but I appreciate your concern.

Oh, well, you could've picked up
a phone and given me a heads up.

Pick up the phone?

Judith, I needed barbecue tongs
to take a leak.

Can you look after Jake or not?

-Charlie said he'd look after him.
-Like hell.

There's no way I'll let your degenerate
brother be responsible for my son.

Sure, don't ask me what I want.

Just boss me around
like you're my boss or something.

Charlie will be fine.
Have a good weekend.

Thanks.

You too.

Hey, can we go out to dinner tonight?

Do I look like I'm in any shape
to go to dinner?

I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

-The answer is no.
-Okay.

Then can we go to the video store
and rent the new "Final Fantasy"?

Jake, I hurt myself.
I'm in a lot of pain.

So? When I took a soccer ball
to the nads, I was in a lot of pain...

...and all my coach said was,
"Walk it off. "

Well, you can't just walk this off.

Not with that attitude.

Hey, there he is.
How's it going, buddy?

My life stinks.

Cheer up, you're still a kid.

It's gonna get much worse.

-Where have you been?
-Taking a nap.

-Why?
-I find it refreshes me.

You said you were gonna take care
of everything.

Yeah, so?

So while you were sleeping,
I had to answer the door.

Do you realize how petty
you sound right now?

-Relax, lie down, I got it covered.
-No, you don't.

Nothing is covered. It's all coverless.

Now, there is a life that stinks.

What's the agenda?
What do you want?

-I wanna go out to dinner.
-Yeah, well, I want my own talk show.

You'll eat what we've got.

Why can't we go out?

Alan, I can't deal with this.
Talk to your son.

That's it? You're done covering?

I didn't know
he was gonna be impossible.

-Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
-Keep yapping and you won't be.

-Charlie, just take him to dinner.
-Why should l?

He's not gonna shut up till he gets it.

That's true. I'll drive you crazy.

Yeah, well, do your worst.

If we go out to dinner,
there's nothing to clean up.

We're not going out.

-You usually wanna go out to dinner.
-Not tonight.

You're not punishing me,
you're just punishing yourself.

Back off, bobblehead.

Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

-We're not going.
-Why not?

-This conversation's over.
-Not if I keep talking.

So where do you wanna eat?

Clucky's.

What's Clucky's?

Zesty fire-roasted chicken...

...with Grandma Clucky's
secret herbs and spices.

All right, where is it?

There's several convenient locations.

Like where?

I don't know. I just sit in the car.

I've never seen a Clucky's here.

-How about a pizza?
-No.

-Burgers?
-No.

Sushi?

-ltalian? Chinese?
-No.

-Clucky's?
-No.

You're not even listening.

I mean yes.

Clucky's.

I'm not driving all over the city
hoping to stumble across a Clucky's.

This isn't the Clucky's my mom
takes me to.

No kidding.

Where are we anyway?

It's called Watts.

Hurry up and finish your chicken.

I like the Cajun Clucky's better.

Good for you.

-Can I go back and get Cajun Clucky's?
-No, eat what you got.

-But I like the Cajun Clucky's.
-Why did you order the regular Clucky's?

Because I forgot
I like the Cajun Clucky's.

Oh, just eat the freaking chicken.

Fine.

Why do you say freaking?
I know what you mean.

-I'm not a little kid anymore.
-Eat.

Don't talk. Eat!

What's up?

I gotta pee.

Charlie, get the tongs.

Charlie?

Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee

Gotta pee, pee, pee

Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee, gotta pee

Alan, I've got somebody
who wants to meet you.

Not a good time, Mom.

Y es, I can see that.

Are you all right?

No, not really.

Oh, my poor baby.

Well, anyway, Mona, Alan.

Alan, Mona.

Hi, Mona.

Hello. What happened to you?

I was fixing a satellite dish
and I fell off the roof.

Well, why didn't you just call the guy?

You wanna know
why I didn't call the guy?

I'll tell you why I didn't call the guy.

Because you don't need
to call the guy.

It's a simple adjustment
that any idiot can do.

And, yes, I know,
this idiot fell off the roof...

...but it was after I fixed it
all by myself, no guy.

Okay, the ice has been broken.
I'll just give you Mona's number...

...and you can call her some time
when it's more convenient.

Come along, dear.

Do you just stay awake nights...

...trying to think of new ways
to embarrass me?

Still gotta pee.

Oh, God.

Oh, what the hell.

Oh, yeah.
The Cajun Clucky's is way better.

I'll notify Zagats.

Before we stop at the video store,
can we get ice cream?

-Who said we're stopping?
-I wanna rent the new "Final Fantasy. "

Y eah, well, I want my
$80,000 Mercedes...

...not to smell like chicken.

But life is full
of little disappointments.

Okay, forget the ice cream.
We'll just stop at the video store.

Jake, I'm tired, I've got a headache.

I just paid $1 00 to get
my car back from the "chicken valet. "

And I wanna go home.

Please?

I'm sorry. What part of no
did you not understand?

The "nnn" or the "ooo"?

How about if we stop
in front of the store...

...I'll run in, get the video game,
and you wait in the car?

How about we stop
by the video store...

...and I just stuff you
through the return slot?

I wouldn't fit.

Try me.

Oh, come on,
it will only take a minute.

You might be able to bully your parents
into doing whatever you want...

...but when I say no, that's it.

Okay. Then I guess I won't have
a video game to play this weekend.

Exactly.
You'll find something else to do.

Right. It will just be you and me.

-They're all out of "Final Fantasy. "
-So get something else.

But I want "Final Fantasy. "

Are you telling me that out
of this store...

...thousands of movies and video games,
there's nothing here that interests you?

You're not gonna like the answer.

I'm having chest pains.

You're giving me chest pains.

I bet they have "Final Fantasy"
at another store.

You want a final fantasy?

Close your eyes and imagine yourself
flying across a freaking video store...

... because that's what's about
to happen.

Again with the freaking.

Excuse me, but did I hear you say
you were looking for "Final Fantasy"?

I was about to return one,
you can have it.

-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

-Oh, he's really something, isn't he?
-Oh, yeah, he's something.

The question is, what?

I have a boy his age.

-Single mom.
-Single uncle.

-Betsy.
-Charlie.

-Jake.
-Nobody asked you.

Betsy, maybe we can get
the boys together...

...for a little play date some time.

I don't want a play date
with some stupid kid...

...just so you can have sex with her.

Isn't he something?

Yeah. Well, it was nice meeting you.

Bye-bye.

What?

Are you happy?

Pretty much. You?

Hello.

"Controlled substance.

Do not exceed one pill
every six hours. "

Yeah, right.

What fresh childproof hell is this?

Come on, you bastard.

Yes.

-What are we doing?
-I'm taking you back to your mother.

Why?

Why? I'll tell you why.

Because you're no fun anymore.

Because the whole
"isn't he cute" thing is over.

I tell you, if this is a prelude
to what you'll be as a teenager...

...then we've got a serious problem.

Whatever.

You see, right there,
that attitude does not fly with me.

Whatever.

God, I hope that's the chicken.

She's not home.

Do not "ha-ha" me.

Never "ha-ha" me.

Judith, come get your kid.

Don't hide behind the couch.

I can see you, Judith.

Hey, how about some ice cream?

Sure.

Listen, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

Sorry you slipped in dog crap
chasing me.

Thank you.

Now, you know that I love you...

...but we gotta be clear
on a couple of things.

I get that you're growing up,
your body's changing...

...your emotions are in flux.

But the important thing you need to keep
in mind is that I don't care.

When you're in my house,
when you're out with me...

...and especially
when we're around women...

...you will be adorable, got it?

I'm trying to concentrate.

Don't shush me. Never shush me.

Whatever.

Please be the chicken.

Pour me one of those, will you?

You know, mixing those pills
with alcohol is a really bad idea.

Not if you're trying to die.

Hey, how many of those pills
you got left?

.......... ********** ..........

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven--

-What are you doing?
-Masticating.

-What?
-Don't worry.

-lt doesn't mean what you think.
-What do you think I think?

You know.

Okay, I know what I know.

What do you know?

I know you're supposed to masticate
your food 20 times before you swallow.

Yeah, but what about the other thing?

What other thing?

The thing you thought I was thinking.

I'm sorry, Dad. You lost me.

-Morning.
-Oh, morning. Isn't this your day off?

-lt is. But I need to talk to Charlie.
-Well, good luck.

He got home, had a bowl of chili,
threw up and went to bed.

He probably threw up
because he didn't masticate enough.

Hey, potty-mouth,
there's a lady present.

Why don't you tell me
what you need...

...then you can go enjoy your day off by
spreading sunshine and cheer to others.

It's about the house.
I should wait for Charlie.

I live here too. What's the problem?

I'll wait.

Oh, for God's sakes, pretend I'm Charlie.
Talk to me.

Okay.

Charlie, I thought it over.

If you want me to kill your brother,
I'll need the cash up front.

-Very amusing.
-Thanks, I've been taking an improv class.

Okay, here's the deal.

I got five brothers and sisters.

I'm the middle child, which probably
explains why I'm such a people pleaser.

Anyhow, my brother Philip,
he's the second oldest.

He's in the roadside fireworks business,
which is, as you might expect, seasonal.

This creates some economic uncertainty,
which has strained his marriage.

Perhaps not as much as him boinking
his wife's half-sister.

But it's a snowball effect.

Anyway, to make a long story short.

T oo late.

Fair enough. Berta one, Zippy one.

Anyway, Philip can't live at his house
because technically it's a crime scene.

-Which is why I wanted to ask Charlie--
-You want your brother to stay here?

Oh, don't be stupid.

He's staying at my place...

...trying to wean himself off the meth
and the codeine and whatnot.

I wanna stay here for a couple of days.

-That's okay. I'll ask Charlie.
-No, you don't have to ask Charlie.

You can ask me.

Fine.

Oh, you'd like an answer now.

That'd be swell.

Well, I would have to say...

...after due consideration...

...and taking into account all the factors
that are involved...

...that it would be our pleasure
to have you.

Super. Do you mind if I take your room?

-My room? Gee, l--
-Trust me.

You want me to have a room
with a private crapper.

Okay. By all means.

-Take my room. I'll bunk with Jake.
-Thanks.

What do you mean
you'll bunk with Jake?

-ls that a problem?
-Yes, I need my privacy.

-For what?
-You know.

Never again.

Never, ever, ever again.

You gonna quit drinking?

Don't be ridiculous.

I'm gonna quit waking up.

What are you doing?
Is this your day off?

It is, but your brother invited me to be
your houseguest for a couple of days.

Did he, now?

I was gonna ask you, but Alan said
he could speak for both of you.

Did he, now?

-You got a problem with that?
-Don't be silly. You're like family.

Yeah, well,
I've seen how you treat family.

Hey, you're always welcome here.
You don't even have to ask.

-Morning, Alan.
-Hey, look, who finally--

Berta? Living here? Are you insane?

She needed a place to stay.
What would you have said?

I would have explained my sincere belief
that there are boundaries...

... between employer and employee...

...which exist specifically
to protect said employer...

...from accidentally seeing
the employee...

...prancing around
in her big cotton granny-panties.

All right. Go tell her that.

Okay, I was bluffing.

Look, look, it's just for a couple of days.
We can tough it out.

But we wouldn't have to...

...if you hadn't presumed to invite
someone to stay without my permission.

Hey, hey, I live here too.

So do termites.

But they don't have
guest-inviting privileges either.

-You're equating me with termites?
-Hell, no. You can get rid of termites.

You know, if I thought you meant that,
I would be really hurt.

Too subtle?
Okay, let me take another tack.

Do you know why I've never
accepted money from you to stay here?

I assumed you were being
compassionate and generous...

...during a difficult period in my life.

It's so you can be here and Jake
can be here, but it remains my house.

-Not our house.
-What's the difference?

In my house, what you think, what you
want, what you say, doesn't mean squat.

It's just jibber-jabber.

So you're saying I have no rights here?

I thought that was understood.

I can't believe we're talking about it.

I've been living here two years.
You still consider me a houseguest.

No, my houseguests bring a bottle
of wine and have sex with me.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go get some
chardonnay and assume the position.

Hey, don't be letting your mouth
write checks your ass can't cash.

Pompous jerk.

I don't know how you put up with that.

You heard? We were whispering.

Must be one of them
acoustical anomalies.

I just think it's criminal,
the way Charlie treats you.

Like some kind of second-class citizen.

Second class?

I aspire to second class.

You know the pecking order
in this house?

Charlie. Women Charlie sleeps with.
Charlie's bookie.

Women Charlie hopes to sleep with.
Termites. Me.

Well, that's just not right.

What am I supposed to do?
I can't really afford my own place.

I could, but it certainly
wouldn't be on the beach.

Unless the beach was Guadalcanal.

It's a shame. You paying all that money
for an ex-wife and an ex-wife's house...

...and you're not
allowed inside either one.

Exactly.

I'm a victim here.

Yeah. You got victim
written all over you.

Does my brother sympathize?

Do Catholic priests
make good babysitters?

Listen. You want rights and privileges,
you gotta demand them.

Stand up to Charlie. Get in his face.

You know what? You're right.

-And starting now.
-Go get him, tiger.

Come here, Charlie. I wanna--

Oh, that is so wrong.

-Hey.
-Hey.

You know, Charlie,
you've really got a beautiful view here.

You're just noticing that?

Well, I spend most of my days
looking at dirty toilets...

...and those Rorschach tests
you call bed sheets.

It's nice you get a chance
to stop and smell the roses.

Oh, don't get me started
on the smells around here.

Hey, listen, Berta,
you know how I feel about you, right?

No, tell me.

Oh, gee, I could never put it into words.

Well...

...then show me.

Relax, I'm just screwing with you.

Good one.

Anyway.

I believe there are certain boundaries
between an employer and an employee.

I think it'd be best if you found--

Oh, I agree with you
about the boundaries.

I've been keeping quiet about the things
your brother says behind your back.

-What does he say?
-I don't wanna cause problems.

No, no, no, come on, tell me.

Let's just say that he doesn't always
appreciate everything you do for him.

You know what the problem is?

-I'm a soft touch.
-You do have a big heart.

And there are always people out there
who will take advantage of that.

-You wouldn't think it'd be your brother.
-Yeah, that's the saddest part.

But what can I do about it?

Respect's not freely given in this life,
Charlie.

You gotta demand it.

-It's time for me to stand up for myself.
-Good for you.

And while you're up...

...would you get me one of those
Japanese beers in the refrigerator?

-Oh, sure. Be right back.
-Thanks.

I'm a bad pussycat.

Did you know
your body doesn't digest corn?

It goes out the same way it comes in.

It's like a little bookmark in your poop.

Did they teach you that at school?

Nope. It's the powers of observation.

Jake, that's not dinner conversation.

You're right. It's dinner corn-versation.

See what happens
when you don't hit your kids?

-Hey, something smells good.
-Meatloaf.

-Great, I love meatloaf.
-Well, you should make some.

I'll give you the recipe.

You didn't make enough for me?

I'm not your chef.

Is that so?

How did you cook the meatloaf?

In the oven.

My oven.

-What's your point?
-My point?

Oh, don't put me in the middle.
I love you both.

My point is, I'm hungry
and I want meatloaf.

Yeah, well,
I'm Alan and I want respect.

I think I got a better chance
at getting meatloaf.

I'm starting to feel like maybe Jake
and I have overstayed our welcome.

Not at all. Jake's still welcome.
You're the one with the attitude.

My attitude? I thought my attitude
didn't count for anything.

That it was just jabberwocky.

Jibber-jabber, you moron.

Okay, okay, that settles it.
I think it's time we moved.

-We?
-Yeah, we.

But I'm still welcome.

-You'll go where I go.
-Can we get a place on the beach?

Sure, if you don't mind
living under a lifeguard stand.

We managed to get by without your help
before we came here, we'll do it again.

Why do you keep saying "we"?

Your problem is you don't appreciate
the things I do for you.

I'm tired of being treated
as a second-class citizen.

Fine. You wanna leave, leave.

Maybe I will.

-Way to stand up for yourself.
-Thank you.

So are we really out of meatloaf or were
you just saying that to piss him off?

Oh, this looks interesting.

"Two-bedroom, needs work,
up-and-coming neighborhood. "

What does that mean,
up-and-coming neighborhood?

The realtor didn't think he could move
the house saying drug-ravaged battlefield.

-Okay, we'll keep looking.
-Alan, I don't mean to pry.

But after alimony and child support...

...exactly how much
can you afford to spend?

Really?

-Y es, really.
-Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this.

Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes.

The ones I'm wearing.

Based on this amount,
you don't need a realtor.

You need someone
who sells camping equipment.

Yeah, well, that's what I'll do.

All right. But may I propose
a simple alternative?

I'm not living with you, Mom.

Okay.

-Then I have a final alternative.
-And what would that be?

Run straight to your brother's ass
and kiss it repeatedly.

Forget it. I can't stay here anymore.

Hey, Red. You wanna top this off
for me?

Certainly. May I get you a short stack
and some pork links while I'm at it?

No, I'm full.

But as long as we're discussing
dining choices, why don't you bite me?

Oh, goodie. More loved ones.

-Good morning, Charlie.
-Let me guess.

Alan invited you to move in.

No. She's helping me move out.

This is a sad day.

-We're gonna miss you around here, Alan.
-Thank you.

Sad, sad, sad.

Don't you have anything to say, Charlie?

Yeah.

Okay, well, enough of sentiment.

We should really get going.

Apartments in your price range
are a long drive from Malibu.

-I know, Mom.
-A long, long drive.

Got it.

Maybe you should go pee-pee
before--

Okay.

You mind looking after Jake?

If it'll help get you out of here,
I'll breast-feed him.

You know, with Zippy out of here...

...you're gonna have that nice
guest room just go to waste.

-Yeah.
-So I was thinking.

How about if I become a live-in?

A live-in what?

Housekeeper. Easier for you,
easier for me. Everybody wins.

Gee--

Hold that thought.
My coffee just kicked in.

You wanna go down to the arcade
and play air hockey?

No.

-Wanna go to a movie?
-No.

Come on, I'll take you to something
R-rated. See some boobs.

Just leave me alone.

-Are you mad at me?
-What was your first clue?

Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude
toward boobs.

Why are you making us move?

You're not moving.

Well, then why is Dad looking
for another place for us to live?

Because he's trying
to teach me a lesson.

Why don't you tell him to stop?

Because I'm trying to
teach him a lesson.

What's your lesson?

That it's my house.

What's his lesson?

That he lives here too.

Okay, I'm just a kid,
but that sounds stupid even to me.

Well, be that as it may,
I give you my word...

...I'm not gonna let you go anywhere.

-Promise?
-Promise.

Is the boob offer still open?

Come on.

-How do you pronounce her last name?
-Hayek. Salma Hayek.

Her name's as pretty as her boobs.

-Hey.
-Hey.

What's all this?

Found a place.
Fully furnished, ready to move in.

Jake, I packed most of your stuff. You
may wanna check if I missed anything.

-Uncle Charlie?
-Listen to your father.

-But you said--
-I said, listen to your father.

I'm just a pawn.

-So where is this place?
-ln the Valley.

A lovely Spanish-style complex
called Valley Hacienda.

-Good for you.
-Two-bedroom.

Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room.

-Sounds great.
-lt is. And we're going.

I can see that.

Well, it's for the best. I'll finally
have a place that's really mine...

...and you can go back to living
the selfish, unexamined life...

...you obviously cherish.

Looking forward to it.

Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.

Well, then, I guess we should go.

Need some help?

No, we can handle it.

All right. Valley Hacienda,
here we come.

Jake, say goodbye
to your Uncle Charlie.

-Bye, Uncle Charlie.
-Bye, kid.

Jake, go get in the car.

Listen to your father.

I don't think anybody's
learning anything here.

Well, thanks for your hospitality.

I'm sorry we overstayed our welcome.

-Alan.
-I don't wanna go.

Please don't make me go.

I love it here. I love it so much.

-I thought you found a nice place.
-I was bluffing. It sucked, they all sucked.

Do you want me to kiss your ass?
Because I will. Come on, turn around.

-Come on.
-Alan, cut it out.

I mean it. You're the boss.

I'd rather be a second-class
citizen here in paradise...

...than king of a urine-soaked firetrap
next to Burbank Airport.

Alan, Alan, calm down. Calm down.

If you wanna stay, you can stay.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Charlie, you have no idea
how bad it was.

I couldn't bring a woman
to one of these places.

The only way I'd ever have sex
was if I was molested by a rat.

Pull yourself together.

Now, go grab Jake
and we'll have dinner.

Okay. Okay.

-And thanks again.
-You're welcome.

-Hey, hey, Charlie?
-What?

Just before I went down on my knees...

...were you about to say something?

I don't think so.

Before I started weeping...

...you were gonna tell me to stay.

No, I wasn't.

Okay, you're not fooling anybody.

You'd miss me if I was gone.

Despite everything you've said,
we're brothers.

And we have a bond that's deeper
and more meaningful than any--

He folded, didn't he?

My ass is covered with lip prints.

Damn.

Well, anyway.

I guess you wanna head home
and see how Philip's doing.

Who?

Philip. Your brother. Detoxing.

Oh, yeah, sure.

Philip.

My brother.

This isn't so bad.

Seems reasonably safe.

Oh, yeah.

I'm sure the Valley Hacienda
crack dealers...

...have organized
some sort of neighborhood watch.

We could make this work.
I think it's got a lot going for it.

I'm not a big fan of the orange carpet.

But part of the fun of a new place
is fixing it up, making it your own.

Slap on a coat of paint--

--and of course, a little bleach
to take those blood stains in the tub.

Or you could run home
and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly.

Couldn't you just say, "l told you so"?

.......... ********** ..........

Doc, how many more adjustments
do you think I'm gonna need?

Well, Mr. Malinkovich, let's see.

My son won't graduate college
till 201 5...

...so a lot.

See you next time.

Okay, Mr. Dunlop.

It's good to see you again, sir.
And how are we doing today?

Not good. I was making love
to my wife last night--

Oh, my God, is she okay?

She's fine. She was on top.

But my back went out, doc.

Okay, well, let's get you on the table
and get to work.

Whoa, steady there big fella.

I took some pain pills my wife
had left over from her C-section.

-I guess my legs are a little rubbery.
-Well, how many pills did you take?

Well, let's see.

One when I went to bed,
one when I got up. Seven.

Really? You know it's not usually
a good idea...

...to pop class A narcotics
like Skittles.

-I gotta lie down.
-Okay, okay, but not here, not now.

No, no, no. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Mr. Dunlop?

Mr. Dunlop, you need to get up.

Help.

Fire.

Big giant guy.

Oh, perfect.

Dr. Harper speaking.

Judith, this is not a good time.

I'm with a patient.

Well, what about Jake?

Well, no, I can't pick him up
at school now. Why can't you do it?

You're not the only one
under pressure, Judith.

All right, all right. I'll call Charlie
and have him pick him up.

Hey, hey, stop that.

Hey, stop that.

Do you need to get it?

No, the machine will pick up.

Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

Charlie, I need your help.

Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up.

Oh, for God's sake.

See?

Hey, look who's here.

-Hi.
-How come you' re not in school?

He got sent home for misbehaving.

Well, it's about time.

When I was your age,
I had already been arrested twice.

Charlie, don't.

No convictions.

I had a bad day.
I had to cancel all my patients...

-...and close my office to pick him up.
-Wow, what a drag.

I got new video games.
You wanna play?

-Sure.
-Did you forget you're punished?

No, why does Uncle Charlie
have to suffer?

Go to your room.

In some countries you're innocent
until proven guilty.

You confessed.

Oh, yeah.

And that country you're thinking of
is this one, genius.

-What did he do?
-Something awful.

How awful?
These are all multi-player games.

Apparently, there is a little girl in
Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt...

...who is a little more physically
developed than the other girls.

And Jake decided to make a picture
of her and pass it around.

I only passed it to one person.

What happened after that
was not my responsibility.

Dude, why did you sign it?

Okay, that part I regret.

Go back to your room.

"Boobra Schmidt. "

I'm putting this one
on the refrigerator.

-Charlie, this is serious.
-lt really speaks to me.

The girl went home in tears.
Her mother is on the warpath.

-Jake could get expelled.
-For a silly drawing?

It's considered sexual harassment.
The school has a zero tolerance policy.

For the good old days
when you could wander...

...into the girls' locker room
pretending you were blind.

You actually did that?
That's horrible.

No, the horrible part was
stealing the dog from the blind kid.

Well, unfortunately,
times have changed...

...and we no longer live
in a Porky's movie.

What's a Porky's movie?

Close the door.
I'll be in to talk with you in a minute.

Go easy on him. He doesn't
understand what he did wrong.

He's right. I don't have a clue.

I thought I told you to close the door.

It is closed.

-Go in your room.
-Fine.

You know what,
maybe I should talk to him.

Oh, now you wanna help?

What's that supposed to mean?

It means why didn't you
pick up the phone...

...when I needed you
this afternoon?

I didn't want to.

See, see? I can't depend on you.

I never have been able
to depend on you. I never will be.

-You know why?
-Because I'm undependable?

Yes, yes. Undependable and selfish.

And frankly, I'm the idiot.

I've deluded myself into believing...

...that when I desperately needed
my brother to pick up my kid...

...he might actually bother to pick up
the freaking phone.

Okay, okay, in my defense,
I really didn't want to.

Okay, you're right. I'm sorry,
I should have picked up the phone.

Forget it. What's done is done.
No sense grinding on it.

Thank you.

I just have to accept the fact
that I can't count on anyone.

Least of all an emotionally immature
narcissist...

...who thinks the sun rises out
of his navel, sets in his scrotum...

...and only cares
about what lies between the two.

Okay, I'm no expert,
but that sounds a lot like grinding.

I am done talking to you.

Oh, come on, Alan, I said I was sorry.
Give me another chance.

For what? To let me down?

Tell me what I can do.
Name something. Anything.

Okay, I have to go to Jake's school
if I can keep him from being expelled.

You want me to go?
I am there. Count on me.

No, my receptionist is out sick
all week.

And I need somebody to handle
the phones while I'm gone.

-ln your office?
-Yes.

Way out in the valley?

Yes.

All day?

Yes.

Gee, tomorrow is not really good
for me.

All right. All right, what time?

-The office opens at 8.
-O'clock?

No, degrees.

No reason to be snide,
I don't wanna be late.

Fine. We leave at 7.

O'clock?

Okay, Charlie, time to get up
and go to work.

Charlie?

Of course.

Never even came home.

Why help your only brother...

...when you can be out
boffing total strangers?

"I'll be there for you.
You can count on me. "

My own fault.
I'm just stupid and gullible--

And annoying. Don't forget annoying.

-You're here?
-You said 7:00, right?

-You got yourself up?
-Didn't have to.

-Why not.
-Didn't sleep.

-You haven't been to bed?
-Not my bed.

You want coffee? I made
some coffee. It's good coffee.

No more coffee.

Why don't you make some more
coffee while I go take a squirt?

-Morning.
-Berta. Berta, Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert.

-He just getting home?
-Y eah.

You gotta wonder how long he'd
keep burning that penis at both ends.

I try not to think about it.

Listen, Charlie's coming with me
to work today.

-Why?
-He's gonna help me at the office.

You wanna bet?

-What's up with Uncle Charlie?
-What do you mean?

He's peeing off the deck.

I thought we weren't allowed
to.

-We're not.
-We're not?

No, we're not.

Okay. What's the Oompa Loompa
doing here on a weekday?

-He got suspended from school.
-Why isn't he with his mother?

Judith had a little liposuction
yesterday...

...and she needs to stay in bed...

...until she stops leaking fat.

Yeah, I hate it when that happens.

So, what did the melon-head do?

Oh, it's a long story.

Worth a thousand words.

Come on, Charlie, let's go.

Hang on. I'm not done yet.

Oh, will you leave the sea gulls alone
for crying out loud?

So...

...you like making fun of girls
with big boobs?

Not anymore.

Gridlock.

Stop.

People do this every day?
Drive to work at eight miles an hour?

Pretty much.

I'd have to kill myself.

-Oh, click.
-What?

I just had a phenomenal
business idea.

They haven't perfected
personal jetpacks yet.

Okay, I have another one.

We buy a doughnut machine
and put it in your trunk.

Let's go back to the jetpacks.

Hear me out. Next time you're stuck
in a traffic jam...

...just pop your trunk and sell
doughnuts to all the other drivers.

We'll call them...

...Gridnuts.

Trunk Crullers.

Stop 'n' Go-Nuts.

-Charlie?
-Yeah?

-Please stop talking.
-Okay.

I got it. Trunkin' Donuts.

Here it is. The chiropractic offices
of Dr. Alan Harper.

This is where you come every day?

Yep. For 1 1 years.
What do you think?

I would have killed myself
1 0 and a half years ago.

Okay. Now, all you have to do
is sit here.

And when the phone rings, pick it up
and say, "Dr. Harper's office. "

So right off the bat, I lie?

I am a doctor, Charlie.

Y eah, and I'm king
of the traffic doughnuts.

Moving on. I've canceled
all the morning appointments...

...the only thing you're gonna
deal with is walk-ins.

Have them make an appointment
for another time.

So I don't get to crack
anybody's back?

Charlie, listen to me very carefully.

You must not touch the patients.

This is not me talking.
This is the State of California.

-Okay.
-Let me be absolutely clear.

No touching the patients.

Got it.

What did I just say to you?
Repeat it back to me.

Boy, you're really not
a morning person, are you?

All right, I gotta go
get to Jake's school.

Say a prayer that I can keep him
from being expelled.

Don't worry about a thing. It's
under control. You can count on me.

Oh, if I could believe
even one of those things.

Okay. Where can I hang myself?

Hello.

Oh, hey, Alan.

I said, "Dr. Harper's office. "

I did.

You know what, call back
and give me another chance.

Hello. Damn, try it again.

-Are you waiting to see the principal?
-Yeah.

-Oh, have a seat.
-Oh, thank you.

-Alan.
-Mindy.

-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

You must be Boobra's mom.

Barbara's mams.

Hi.

Don't worry, Alan.
I'm not touching the patients.

There are human lives
at stake here, man.

I need those spines delivered
immediately.

Hello. Can I give you
a complimentary adjustment?

I'm here for the masseuse position.

I see. Well, I'm really not authorized
to do any hiring...

...but you're obviously qualified.

So the hell with protocol,
welcome aboard.

Let me tell you, puberty is
hard enough for a young girl...

...without having to be leered at and
made fun of by obnoxious little boys.

I couldn't agree with you more.
I assure you...

...I've had a talk with Jake about how
wrong it is to objectify women's--

Up here. I'm up here.

I know. I know. I see you.
And let me tell you something.

There is no one more sympathetic
than l...

...to the plight
of the large-breasted woman.

Plight? It's not an affliction.

Well, no, not the breasts themselves
but the attendant back problems...

...associated with carrying
the enormous load.

So now my breasts are a load?

From a strictly engineering standpoint,
yes.

See, see, I am a chiropractor.

And I deal with the heartache
of MMS all the time.

-MMS?
-Massive Mammary Syndrome.

A term I coined in an article
I submitted...

...to the Journal of the American
Chiropractic Association.

It hasn't really caught on.

Anyway, MMS is particularly acute
among strippers...

... but they bring it on themselves
with those humongous implants.

Yours, on the other hand,
appear quite natural.

God given, am I right?

What the hell is wrong with you?

I don't know.

I was a bottle baby.

I'm sorry, Dr. Harper's
not in this morning.

If your back's bothering you,
we do have a masseuse on duty.

Fine. Anything.

Let's see, she just went in with
a patient about five minutes ago.

-So if you don't mind waiting--
-Thank you, that was great.

Good. Come back soon.

Soon? I'll be back after lunch.

-You next?
-Oh, please.

Let's go.

-What's this?
-Your cut.

Click!

-I am really sorry.
-Just drop it.

You know, in my defense--
Well, well, in the defense of all men...

...we do live in a mammo-centric
society.

Mammo-centric?

Another coinage of mine.

Hasn't really permeated
the cultural Zeitgeist.

Hey, bottle baby, I'm up here.

That perfectly illustrates my points.
Point.

From the moment we are born, we are
basically bombarded by breasts.

Breasts in advertising,
breasts in television, in movies.

Here a breast, there a breast,
everywhere a breast-breast.

Heck, you can understand
the fixation.

You're a horrible little man.

Okay, I had hoped that we could have
a spirited exchange of ideas here.

But if we are gonna just degenerate
into name-calling....

...we should wait for the principal to
decide what a reasonable punishment...

-...for my son would be.
-Fine. We'll let the principal decide.

Okay.

I'm Principal Gallagher.

Oh, God,
my boy's gonna get the chair.

Time.

Man, is this day ever gonna end?

Hey, Alan.

What's going on here?

I had another business idea.

-You what?
-Hear me out.

What do men like better
than doughnuts?

Hang on.

Time.

Four thousand two hundred,
4300, 301, 302--

I hate singles.
Don't you hate singles?

You turned my business
into a brothel.

I thought you'd be proud of me.
I didn't touch a single patient.

I left you alone
for a couple of hours...

...and you turned my business
into a brothel.

You know what you need?
A nice, relaxing massage.

Oh, shut up.

There is a happy ending here.

From what I saw,
there was like 40 of them.

And that's just what's on the books.

I don't want to know about it.
I never wanna know about it.

-Okay, we'll change the subject.
-Thank you.

-How did it go at Jake's school?
-I don't want to talk about it.

I never wanna talk about it.

-You screwed up, huh?
-ln ways you can't imagine.

So he's expelled?

No, he's just suspended
for the week.

That's not so bad.
It's already Wednesday.

I have been asked never to set foot...

...on the grounds of Woodward
Avenue Elementary School.

-No kidding.
-And it was suggested...

...that I resign from the PT A.

And there's talk of a civil suit.

Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover...

...might just drop by tonight
to kick my ass.

Remind me to charge the camcorder.

Oh, click, another great business idea.

-I don't wanna hear it.
-Just listen.

We put a massage table
in the trunk of your car.

-Forget it, Charlie.
-We'd probably need a van.

-I'm not listening.
-Oh, come on.

Who needs their tension relieved
more than guys stuck in traffic?

We'll call it,
Bumper to Humper.

Speed Humps.

I got it. Jiffy Lube.

Oh, wait, somebody already has that.

.......... ********** ..........

Why do you have to leave?

Charlie, I have to get home.
I have to feed my cat.

-I have to feed my fish.
-We've been in bed for three days.

I'm guessing the cat's fed and what's
left of the fish is in the Kitty Litter.

Well, I also have a job.

-Call in sick.
-I did it yesterday.

Okay, call in horny.
I'll write you a note.

I wish I could. I love being with you.

Me too.

And having you here
just makes it all the better.

We've been seeing each other
for over two months...

...and you've never spent the night.

Well, go clean up the dead animals
and I'll come over tonight.

Deal. I'll cook you dinner.

Great.

I think I love you, Charlie Harper.

Thank you.
I'll see you later.

Wait a minute.

Did you just say "thank you"?

-Did l?
-Yes.

I said, "l think I love you"
and you said, "Thank you. "

-What's that supposed to mean?
-Thank you?

It's an expression of appreciation.

Thank you.

That's it?
You don't have anything to add?

Thank you...

...so very much.

Great. That's great. I open my heart
to you and you couldn't care less.

Well, that's not fair.
I could care less. A lot less.

What do you want me to do?
Lie to you?

No, I want you to drop dead,
you smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch.

That could have been ugly.

Hey, guess what happened
at school today.

-You made the honor roll.
-What's that?

Forget it.
What happened at school?

-Well, there's this girl--
-Okay, now I'm listening.

-Her name is Robin Newberry.
-Name's not important. Proceed.

She gave me a cupcake.

-Yeah? So?
-I think she likes me.

-So, what's the problem?
-Now I think she thinks I like her back.

-Do you?
-I didn't think I did.

But it was a really good cupcake.

Wow, talk about
your perfect metaphor.

No, it was a cupcake.

Okay, blank slate. Listen up.

I'm gonna tell you something
that will serve you well for life.

Like, "When you're peeing outside,
always face downwind"?

Better. By the way,
what the hell were you thinking?

I was thinking,
"Boy, I hope that's really warm rain. "

Okay, okay.
Let's focus on today's lesson.

Never, ever
confuse cupcakes with love.

But I love cupcakes.

We all love cupcakes. That doesn't mean
you have to love the baker.

-Her mom baked it.
-Missing the point.

-Robin just helped with the icing.
-Okay. Okay.

She made a smiley face
with Red Hots.

I get it.

I'm just saying that when someone
freely gives you her cupcake...

...your only obligation is to enjoy it.

No reason to get emotionally involved.

-Why not?
-lf you do, you'll be stuck...

...eating the same damn cupcake
for the rest of your life.

But it was a really good cupcake.

I can't stop thinking about it.

Yeah, I've had cupcakes like that.

The thing you gotta remember is
there will always be other cupcakes.

And if the day should come when you
find yourself in a cupcake drought--

And those days come,
don't kid yourself.

--well, then you just shell out
a couple of bucks for a nice Ho Ho.

-Understand?
-I think so. Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

No problem.

-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
-Sex.

Well, how about that?

The booger eater
grasped the symbolism.

-You were talking to my son about sex?
-He came to me with a cupcake problem.

I thought it was about sex.

I was using cupcakes as a metaphor.

Jeez, the kid got it.

Okay, walk me through the metaphor.

-Some little girl gave him a cupcake--
-Okay, stop.

"Gave him a cupcake. "
Are we talking baked goods...

...or are we talking
some new hip-hop slang?

Baked goods. I told him it was okay
to enjoy the cupcake...

...without feeling
emotionally obligated.

So you told my son
it's okay to have sex with a girl...

...without having
any feelings towards her?

Lucky for us
he asked me stuff I know about.

There's no "us" here.

There's no "lucky. "
That's a terrible lesson.

Hey, I could've done 20 minutes
just on licking the icing.

But I took the high road.

Okay, okay, enough.
Here's the deal.

From now on, all cupcake conversations
will be referred to me.

Why? You don't know the difference
between a Ding Dong and your elbow.

Nevertheless, I do not want him learning
about relationships from a misogynist.

A misogynist?
You're saying I'm a misogynist?

Yes, Charlie. You are a misogynist.

I'm a misogynist?
I'm a misogynist?

That is really low, Alan.
Calling your own brother a misogynist.

G-l-N or G-E-N?

-G-Y-N.
-Thanks.

-I do not hate women.
-Oh, come on, Charlie.

If anything,
I am the opposite of a misogynist.

I'm a pro-sogynist. I love women.

Oh, is that so? Even if there's no
possibility of having sex with them?

What?

Exactly. And it is precisely that attitude
I do not want my son to grow up with.

Okay, okay. Hold it just a second.

So you'd rather
he grow up to be like you?

Scared of women?
Manipulated by women?

-Hey, that's not true.
-Oh, please. Look at your ex-wife.

Say what you want about me,
but I've never chosen women...

-...who do nothing but mistreat me.
-Hey, stud.

I don't know what kind of sick, twisted
party you had the last couple days...

...but I sure as hell
ain't cleaning it up.

That is different. Way different.

-Hey, Dad, what time is it?
-Twenty after 6. Why?

Because I have to call my girlfriend
at 6:30.

-What girlfriend?
-Robin Newberry.

Cupcake Robin Newberry?

-Charlie, stay out of it.
-How can I stay out of it?

If I saw a bus heading for him,
would I not throw myself in front of it?

-Would you?
-I'm just making a point here.

Charlie, if you don't mind,
I'll handle it.

Jake, I thought we talked about this.

I shouldn't take a cupcake
from a girl if I don't like her.

-That's right.
-So I decided to like her.

We're exclusive.

-Exclusive?
-That means I don't talk to other girls...

...and I get a cupcake every day.

I'd better call now.
If I'm late, she yells at me.

Congratulations, Alan.
Your son is officially pastry whipped.

Marco.

Not now, Rose.

Marco.

Rose, I'm not in the mood.

Marco.

Polo.

-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

Something wrong?

I'm not sure.

Rose, do you think I'm a misogynist?

Oh, wow, yeah.

Why? Did somebody say you weren't?

Marco.

How can I be a misogynist?

My whole life is a testament
to my love for women.

It's sweet that you think that...

...but what you call love
is really just an obsession to control...

...and dominate
based on mistrust and hostility.

Yeah, so?

You forget
I spent the night with you once.

You don't make love to a woman,
you overpower her.

You subjugate her. You ravage her.

Anyhow, it's obvious you're still trying
to resolve longstanding Oedipal issues.

Hold on.

O-E-D.

-You sure?
-Yeah, I have a Master's in psychology.

And I know how to spell.

"l have a Master's in psychology
and I know how to spell. "

Here it is: Oedipus complex.

Okay, that's what I thought.
It's just sick.

Unconscious, unresolved
sexual feelings towards my mother?

I didn't write the dictionary, Charlie.

But it's not true.
I despise my mother.

Consciously, yes.

And that's why
you conflate sex and aggression.

It's textbook misogyny.

Conflate? Come on.
What is it, fancy word day?

It means to join together.

Thank you.
So, what are you saying?

You will never be able
to have a trusting...

...and truly loving relationship
with any woman...

...until you resolve
your feelings about your mother.

Broads have been
telling me that for years.

It's a lot of hooey.

It's okay, Charlie.

The world is filled with
women who seek out misogynists.

Women who need
men to mistreat them...

...and provide them
with angry, aggressive sex...

...in order to satisfy
their own twisted pathology.

I see.

Well, I guess I'll just have to
look for a woman like that.

Marco.

-Thanks for giving me another chance.
-You were so darling, I couldn't resist.

I know I've got some intimacy issues,
but I'm working on them.

And if you could just
be patient with me...

...I think you and l
could truly conflate.

What's "conflate" mean?

Look, you don't have to go.

Relax, Charlie. All men
have performance problems occasionally.

No, no, no. It's not officially
a performance problem until we give up.

Right now,
it's just unusually long foreplay.

Sorry, but I have to get back to work.
Damn, my carpal tunnel's acting up.

How about if I come with you?

-We can give it a shot in your car.
-It's okay. I still love you.

Thank you.

I mean, I really appreciate
your understanding...

...and support during this dark time.

I'll call you.

-What?
-Nothing.

Go ahead. Say it.

I have nothing to say.

Except, you know:

Oh, my. Don't tell me
I got a rise out of you.

Alan, I am right on the edge.
Be very careful.

Sorry.

I didn't realize it was so impotent.

-You forget one thing.
-Oh, what's that?

I can still run.

Yes?

Mom, it's me, Charlie.

I'm a little busy right now.
What do you want?

-We need to talk.
-About what?

How I'll never be able to have
a meaningful relationship...

... because of the way
you screwed me up.

Well...

...sorry about that.

-Let me in.
- There 's more?

Yes.

Will this having children thing
never end?

Mom.

Look, l' m sorry this is such a
major inconvenience for you, but--

Oh, God.

-What are you doing?
-Downward-Facing Dog.

-What?
-It's yoga, Charlie.

Could your dog possibly face upward
while we talk?

Fine.

Jeez.

What the hell is the mutt doing now?

Charlie, just say
what you came to say.

Okay, well, are you aware
that I'm a misogynist?

Really? I raised you Episcopalian.

This isn't funny.

My anger and mistrust
towards women starts with you.

Wasn't a problem
till it spilled into my sex life.

So you're blaming Mommy...

...because Little Charlie
can't come out and play?

Okay, first of all,
we don't call it "Little Charlie. "

What do we call it, darling?

We don't call it anything.

Well, when you were a baby
we called it Mr. Pinky.

I may never have sex again.

Oh, wait a sec.
Mr. Pinky was the cat.

-What did we call your penis?
-lt doesn't matter.

The point is it isn't working anymore.

And somehow it's all tied up
in some sick, twisted knot with you.

Mr. Pee-pee.

That's it. Well, you can see why
I confused that with Mr. Pinky.

Mom, I learned about relationships
from watching you.

And you know
what toxic little lessons I learned?

-Tell me, sweetheart.
-Men who get emotionally involved...

...get stepped on.

I learned that men who get married
get emasculated.

That the best way
to not get your heart broken...

...is to pretend you don't have one.

-You learned all that from me?
-Yes.

Darling, I've never been more proud
of you than I am at this moment.

-You're joking, right?
-Not at all.

For the first time I look at you
and I see myself.

Oh, that's just insane.

Save room for dessert.
I bought brownies.

No, thanks.
Brownies just remind me of cupcakes.

-His little girlfriend dumped him.
-Really?

She said she needed her space.

-I'm sorry, buddy.
-Want some advice?

Yeah.
What do I do, Uncle Charlie?

I meant from me.

No, thank you.

-Well?
-You might as well listen to your dad...

...because I got nothing.

Less than him?

Fellas, I am the sick puppy
of a downward dog.

Only thing I'm good for is drinking out
of the toilet and sniffing my own ass.

Which, by the way,
I saw our mother do earlier.

Okay, what do you think?

-Marco.
-Oh, jeez.

-Don't do that.
-Sorry.

-Are you okay?
-Oh, sure.

Everything I believed in is wrong.
Everything I thought I was I'm not.

And Mr. Pee-pee's on the fritz.

-Mr. Pee-pee?
-Yeah, it's what my mother used to--

-Don't make me explain this, Rose.
-Okay.

-But he's on the fritz, you say.
-Yes.

Well, I'm not surprised.
The depth of your pathology...

...coupled with your denial
was bound to manifest itself...

...physically sooner or later.

In plain, simple English, Rose.

When your mind gets crazy,
Mr. Pee-pee gets lazy.

I'll put it in another way.

When your psyche gets iffy,
you can't get a stiffy.

Stop it. Stop it.
Just tell me how I can fix it.

Oh, there's no quick fix,
when it comes to limp--

Rose.

-No more rhymes.
-You sure?

I got a beauty with "toner. "

Okay.

Well, traditional therapy can help...

...but you'll have to commit to a long,
arduous process of self-exploration...

...over a period of years.

Years?
I can't go years without Mr. Pee-pee.

Charlie, isn't your long-term
mental and emotional health...

...more important
than a few fleeting orgasms?

It's not even
more important than one.

Well, in that case, I suppose we
could try a shortcut like hypnotherapy.

-You know how to do that?
-I studied it.

But for it to work,
you'd have to trust me completely.

You know, Rose,
as strange as it may seem...

...out of all the women I know,
you're the only one I trust at all.

Personally, I find that very flattering...

...while professionally,
it's deeply disturbing.

Oh, well.

So just relax, sit back,
close your eyes...

...and listen only
to the sound of my voice.

I wanna get my mother
out of my head, okay?

I don't wanna quit drinking,
gambling or any good stuff.

Got it. Okay.

So just relax.

Oh, my.
I see everything's back to normal.

Better than normal.

-Did you take one of those pills?
-I don't need any pills.

It's all me.

And nobody else.

Why don't you relax while I introduce
you to the new, improved Charlie?

-Who were you calling?
-I was just ordering a little chicken.

What smells so good?

Your kid's in the kitchen baking.

-You're kidding.
-Hey, Dad. Want a cupcake?

Sure.

Uncle Charlie?

Thank you.

Have as many as you want.
I've got another batch in the oven.

That's very tasty.
What prompted this?

I figured out I don't need a girlfriend.
If I want a cupcake, I make it myself.

Taking matters into his own hands.

The metaphor is now complete.

Anybody wanna lick the beater?

-No.
-No.

What?

.......... ********** ..........

--fifteen-yard line,
where the officials will mark it.

Russell, the quarterback....

Will you please stop that?

I got a piece of popcorn stuck
in my teeth.

-So go brush them.
-I brushed them this morning.

-So go floss them.
-Oh, gross.

Wait. I got it.

No, that's chicken.

When did we have chicken?

You didn't brush this morning,
did you?

Between you and me,
I lost my toothbrush three days ago.

Still good.

Hey, have you met any of the ladies
my dad's been dating?

-No. You?
-No.

More chicken?

Fingernail.

Yours?

I hope so.

So how come I don't get to meet
Dad's dates?

I don't know,
maybe because you're disgusting.

No, come on, really.

I'm not kidding. For most women,
you're a deal breaker.

You used to say I was a babe magnet.

You used to be little and cute.

Now you're just old and in the way.

That's very hurtful, Uncle Charlie.

The truth is your dad doesn't want you
to get attached to these women...

...in case the relationship
doesn't work.

Why?

He loves you very much
and he cares about your feelings.

You let me meet your dates.

And what does that tell you?

I have no idea.

Hello?

Hi, Dad.

What are you doing up so late?
Charlie, what is he doing up?

He's asleep.

Oh, I'm sorry.

-Charlie.
-What?

Oh, hey, Alan.

What is he doing up so late?

I told him to go to bed.
How many times did I tell you?

Boy, I lost count.

See?

-So how was your date?
-lt was fine.

Did you get any?

-Did I get any what?
-Hang on.

What's he supposed to get?

I swear I don't know
what he's talking about.

Go to bed.

-What are you teaching him?
-What difference does it make?

The only thing he retains
is little shards of chicken.

Wonderful.

So did you get any?

A nice evening.
We had a lovely dinner.

For the record, a lovely dinner...

...doesn't necessarily preclude
carpet burns...

...and a bite mark on your ass.

In this case, it was just dinner
and pleasant conversation.

Well, that's why God gave us
Cinemax and an opposable thumb.

Good evening.

Alan, the kid was asking about these
women you've been going out with.

Why he never meets them.

Really? What did you tell him?

I said it's probably
because he's disgusting.

Oh, Charlie--

I also told him that you love him,
you don't want him to get attached...

...be disappointed
if things don't work.

Good. Thank you.

But how come
I don't get to meet them?

Because you're disgusting.

That's very hurtful, Alan.

Come on, really.

What's the big secret
with these women?

Boy, I really don't wanna get into it.

-They're hideous, right?
-No.

-lnsufferable? Inflatable?
-No.

-Are you insane?
-lnsane. Are they insane?

-Leave me alone.
-Come on, give me a hint.

When you go to pick them up...

...do you need a Border collie
to cut them off?

Stop it.

I'm never gonna stop, Alan.
You know me better than that.

Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

First of all, there's no women.

Imaginary. My next guess
was gonna be imaginary.

Let me finish.

It's just one woman.

I've been seeing the same woman
for weeks.

-I see. You've been playing it slow.
-Yes.

And by slow I mean gay.

I can't talk to you about this.

Alan, you hook a fish
and play it too long.

You know what
you have when you reel it in?

-What?
-A tired fish that thinks you're gay.

Do you drink
while you're babysitting my son?

Not at first, but he wears me down.

-So, what's the deal with this broad?
-She's not a broad.

It's Judith.

-Your ex-wife?
-Yep.

Okay, okay. That's not fair.

You said no to insufferable
and insane.

-Very funny.
-Are you serious?

And by serious I mean dumber
than a bag of doorknobs.

Look, we went out
to dinner weeks ago...

...to talk about getting Jake
into middle school.

Before you know it, we're laughing,
having a great time.

I can see the humor in trying to get
the little bonehead into a good school.

But that doesn't mean you start
dating your ex-wife.

I know what you're thinking.
I'm being naive and romantic.

Not even close.

You can't overlook the fact
that we still have a lot in common.

Yeah, neither of you
have any respect for you.

The point is, she wants to give it
another try and so do l.

We can't let Jake know, we don't
want him to get his hopes up.

Oh, buddy, why don't you just take
an electric sander to your testicles?

We're both adults,
we're aware of the pitfalls...

...and we think it's worth the risk.

Okay, fine. I wish you both
nothing but happiness.

Thank you.

Hello.

Hello.

What's going on?

Sit down, Alan. We need to talk.

Yeah, well, listen, I'd love to but
I've gotta wake up Jake so we can--

Let him sleep.

Am I getting whacked?

It was discussed,
but I was overruled.

Sit down.

Alan, we're all here
because we love you.

And we don't wanna see you
make a terrible mistake.

I'm just waiting
for my toaster strudel to pop.

There we go.

You told on me.

Hey, you wouldn't listen to reason,
so now you're gonna listen to Mom.

Alan, sweetheart, you know,
I only want the best for you, right?

I do.

I do.

Which is why when Judith threw
you out, I was there supporting you.

-You had other options?
-Don't be naive.

I could have sucked up to Judith...

...in order to have more access
to my grandson.

But no, I burned that bridge.

I said horrible things to her
that I can never take back.

Keep in mind, this is a woman who
worked the phrase "mousy bitch"...

...into her wedding toast.

So if you two reconcile,
I'll have to apologize to her.

-So?
-I'd rather kill us all.

Okay, moving on.

Rose? Do you have something
you'd like to say?

Yes, thank you.

Alan, when I first met you,
I didn't care for you at all.

You were a fussy, whiny control freak.

Yes? And now?

Now it doesn't bother me so much.

I think what Rose means is that
since the divorce, you've grown...

...you've been reborn.

That's not what I meant.

If that was what I meant,
that's what I would've said.

-Sorry.
-Yeah, you'll get your turn.

Okay.

Alan, life is all about moving on.

Now, in the animal kingdom,
sharks move forward...

...while crabs move sideways.

So the question you have to ask
yourself is:

Are you a shark or a crab?

Which way do Sea-Monkeys move?

Okay, that's Judith.

Now, I thank you for your concern...

...but I would appreciate it
if nobody said anything...

...and everybody just stayed out of it.

Yeah, right.

-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey. Why aren't you dressed?

I told you I was picking him up early.
Why isn't he ready? Get dressed.

-I'm sorry.
-You're always sorry...

...but I always play the bad guy.

-Damn it, Alan.
-Okay, he's gone.

-I was thinking about you last night.
-Really?

-What were you thinking?
-Just what a nice time I had.

Yes, yes, it was.

Alan?

Turn around.

Hi, Judith.

Hello. How are you?

Fine.

Bye, Dad. Bye, everybody.

Bye, Jake.

-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

-Thanks for staying out of it.
-You're welcome.

Hey, Alan. Come on out,
I got a surprise for you.

Can it wait? Jake forgot
his math book. I'll run it to Judith's.

No, no, no.
You can't go to Judith's.

The surprise is ready now.

Okay. What is it?

Oh, for God's sake.

Wait, there's more.

Twins, Alan. I got them for you,
but you can share if you want.

Charlie, no.

Fine, you can have them both.

Bad luck to split sisters anyway.

I don't want them.
I'm going to Judith's.

I don't think you're getting
the full picture.

Turn around.
Show him the full picture.

That's daily Pilates classes
and one meal a month.

-I'll see you later.
-Are you sure?

Even together, these girls aren't
as old as your ex-wife.

Bye.

Oh, for the love of God.

Stop turning.

Show's over.

-lsn't he adorable?
-Yeah.

When he's sleeping,
he's like a little angel.

I was planning to have
a glass of wine...

...sit in the hot tub
before you came.

I'm sorry. I just wanted to be sure
he got the book. I'll get out.

Alan. Would you like to join me?

Well, I didn't bring a bathing suit.

You don't need a bathing suit.

Okay.

Have you been keeping up
the chlorine treatments?

Without a bathing suit, you're just
inviting algae into your privates.

-I like the new patio furniture.
-Thanks.

-What is that, redwood?
-Teak.

Oh, teak. That must have set me
back a few bucks.

The salesman said it would pay
for itself in five years.

Oh, really? How is it gonna do that?

Is it gonna get a paper route?

-It's very nice.
-Thank you.

Of course, it's gonna require a lot
of upkeep.

Actually, all wood that's outside
requires upkeep except trees.

They seem to have it down.

Alan, are you nervous?

Yeah, a little.

I mean, we've been separated
for two years.

I haven't seen you naked for four.

Except, you know, that one time
I walked in on you on the toilet.

Mom? You out there?

Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

-Take a deep breath.
-What?

I'm thirsty.

-Have something to drink.
-There's no more Goofy Juice.

-So have some water.
-Fine.

-Hey, Mom?
-What?

I'm hungry too.
Can you make me a sandwich?

-No. Have your drink and go to bed.
-Fine.

Mom.

-How about a cookie?
-You already brushed your teeth.

-No, I didn't.
-You said you did.

I always say that.

-Well, then brush them and go to bed.
-Fine.

Oh, God.

Are you okay?

There was a bright light
and I saw my dead grandma.

She seemed happy.

Here, have a little wine.

Thank you. Thank you.

That was close.

Relax, he didn't see you.

But what if he comes back?
Maybe I should go.

Or we could go upstairs
and get in bed.

Bed?

-Our old bed?
-My new bed.

Oh, what was wrong
with the old one?

-Too many memories.
-Of what?

You pretending to sleep
and me watching Letterman?

Alan, do you wanna have this
conversation?

No, I don't. But apparently,
my mouth has a mind of its own.

Well, let's put your mouth
to better use.

I can't go back underwater, Judith.

-Hey, Charlie.
-Yeah?

Not that it's any of my business...

...I couldn't help noticing
the matched set...

...of rotating floozies
on your deck earlier.

They were for Alan. I was trying
to get his mind off of Judith.

With a night of meaningless,
impersonal group sex?

What a good brother.

No, no, a good brother
gets him a couple of girls.

It takes a great brother
to get him two from the same egg.

You know, there is a possibility
that we were wrong about this.

Maybe Alan and Judith
can work things out.

Maybe. But if they do...

-...what happens to Jake?
-Grows up in a happy home...

...with a mommy and daddy
who love each other?

Yeah, but what about me?

It's too late for you, Charlie.

No, I mean,
what happens to me and Jake?

I'll never get to see him.

You really love the little guy, huh?

Yeah, I guess I do.

Love hurts, Rose.

Yes, it does.

Especially when you've given
your heart...

...to someone who barely knows
you exist.

Who insists on plowing through
strange, stupid women...

...who could never love him
the way you do...

...Ieaving you to stand outside...

...alone in the night...

...wishing with all your heart
that he would come to his senses...

...and realize that his true happiness
lies with you and no one else...

...but knowing all the while
that it will never happen...

...because he's a selfish, immature,
heartless jerk.

I mean...

...poor baby.

Okay, I'm gonna stick my neck
out here...

...and say that was the best sex
we ever had.

-I agree.
-Not that it wasn't good before.

It wasn't.

Okay, granted.

Which raises the question:

Why is it so much better now?

-Does it matter?
-Well, no, not really.

I mean, just curious.

I mean, l--

I noticed some new moves
on your part...

...and I can't help wondering where
you might have picked them up.

You haven't been with other women
in two years?

Oh, no, I've been with other women,
I just didn't learn anything.

You, on the other hand, have
an entirely new sexual repertoire...

...including a couple of numbers
I requested when we were married.

-Alan--
-And by requested I mean begged.

Please don't go there.

Now, see, that's what I'm used to
hearing from you in bed.

"Don't go there. " "Don't touch that. "
"Leave that alone, it's not a toy. "

So I've changed.
I would think you would be happy.

Well, I was. Very happy.

But then I started to think about it.

There's no reason
you couldn't have changed with me.

-Oh, please.
-I gave you every chance.

I bought tickets to sex seminars,
I brought home books...

...and tapes and accessories.
And what happened?

I sat right here reading
and watching by myself...

...while eating low-fat love jelly
out of the tube.

Okay, I can see this was a bad idea.

No, the bad idea was sitting in
that filthy hot tub...

...without a bathing suit.

I can feel mushrooms
growing in my crack.

Just go home, Alan.

We're not married.
You can't tell me what to do.

-Hey, Mom? Does this look infected?
-Okay, bye!

It's okay, I didn't see anything.

Hey.

Hey.

What are you watching?

Soft-core porn.

Sound's not on.

I don't need to hear them.

Aren't those the twins
from the deck?

Too late now, Alan.

You could have been delivering
that pizza.

How's Judith?

Fine.

She got some new patio furniture.

That's nice.

Teak.

Put in some rose bushes too.

How about that.

And I think the neighbors
got a new dog.

Mean dog.

Really?

Might have been a coyote.

Hard to say.
It was dark and I was crying.

-Anything else?
-No.

Oh, yeah,
I saw our dead grandmother.

-Where?
-ln the hot tub.

Oh, that's the cab.

Could you lend me 60 bucks?

I don't have my wallet on me.

Sure.

Oh, thank you.

I suddenly have a craving
for pizza.

.......... ********** ..........

That's a cool snake tattoo
on your back.

Thanks. That's Anacoth,
the demon who eats human souls.

My friend Jeffrey has a dog
that eats its own poop.

He tries to lick our face
but we don't let him.

-Okay.
-Who's that one?

That's the Goddess of the Damned.

She whose name cannot be spoken.

-Why, is it hard to pronounce?
-What?

We have a friend at school like that.
He's from lndia. We just call him Rusty.

No kidding.

-Does it hurt to get tattoos?
-Yeah.

-But it's worth it, you know?
-Sure.

Once I bit my tongue really hard
eating a frozen Milky Way...

...but it was totally worth it.

-Good morning.
-Hey, Dad.

-Hey.
-Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad.

-lsabella.
-She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.

I would hope so.

Yeah,
and she was showing me her tattoos.

Lucky you.

There was a time you'd have to pay a
quarter and go into a tent to see that.

Now it's right at your breakfast table.

-Go get dressed.
-I wanna see the rest of her tattoos.

-Go.
-I have a quarter.

Jake.

All right.

Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy
but we keep the house smoke free.

I'm sorry.

Charlie didn't say anything
when I was smoking in bed last night.

Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always
on the same page as his penis.

-Morning, baby.
-Hey.

If you don't like it, don't watch.

I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower. You wanna join me?

Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me
so I got something to work with.

Hurry. Anacoth is hungry.

Anacoth is hungry?

She's referring to her snake tattoo.

Her vagina is called Linda.

Pretty name.

Listen,
I don't wanna overstep my bounds.

This is your house and you're free
to bring into it whoever...

...or whatever you choose.

But I do think I have the right...

...to protect Jake
from being exposed to certain people.

Well, you'd better take him to a hotel.

Because that girl ain't leaving
till one of us is dead.

-Come on, Charlie.
-No. No.

You come on.
You see a little body ink and cigarette...

...and you immediately condemn her.

She's smart,
she's got a great sense of humor...

...and in bed she moves like one of those
paint shakers at Sherwin-Williams.

Nevertheless, I would rather
she didn't hang around Jake.

Fine. I'll talk to her.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Now, unless you wanna lather up
my fanny...

...I'm gonna go hop in the shower
with Anacoth and Linda.

Isabella. I-- I didn't hear you come in.

You weren't meant to.

So...

...you think I'm a bad influence
on your kid?

Well, gee, I wouldn't put it that way.

But, you know,
kids are impressionable.

And the violent psychosexual imagery
of your body art...

...not to mention the smoking...

...aren't something a young boy
needs to-- Why are you taking my hair?

Just a little quirk of mine.

I used to collect stamps.

You know, people like you
have been persecuting people like me...

...for thousands of years.

Well, that's a bit hard to believe.

Seeing as people like me
have historically been victims and food.

But just for clarity...

...who exactly are the people like you?

Those whose eyes are open to a greater
reality than you could ever imagine.

I see.

And do they all collect hair?

-Don't mock what you don't understand.
-I'm sorry.

I tend to resort to mocking
when I'm totally creeped out.

I don't like you.

Yeah, well...

...I'm rubber, you're glue.

Something, something, something, you.

So be it.

So be it.

So be it.

Damn it.

What the hell?

I don't think so, Mom.

First of all, I'm just not a big fan
of costume parties.

Yeah, Jake likes The Wizard of Oz.
I don't think he'd enjoy hanging out...

...with a bunch of drunken real-estate
agents dressed like Judy Garland.

Okay, I'll get him.

Mom wants to ask you something.

Hi, Mom. No.

What happened to your face?

Nothing, I just thought I'd put little
blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.

What do you think?

It suits you.

-What's the deal with your eye?
-I don't know. I think I'm getting a sty.

Might be a bit much
with the toilet paper.

I'd go with one or the other.

-Thank you for your input.
-No problem.

-Where you going?
-lsabella's taking me to a party.

She said it's gonna be out of control.

Can you imagine what this girl
considers to be out of control?

Well, let's see.
Biting the head off a live chicken?

Vivisecting homeless people...

...and playing Hacky Sack
with their still-beating hearts?

What are you talking about?

Do you have any idea
what lsabella is really into?

So she's a little kinky.

No, no, no.
Kinky is a feather duster up your butt.

I think this woman
tried to put a curse on me.

Oh, please.
Who of us hasn't done that?

To know you is to curse you.

She took my hair.

-She took your hair?
-Y eah.

Yeah. And then she laughed like:

-Oh, well, that's different.
-So you see my concern?

Yes, I do. Good night.

Where you going?

To pick up a bottle of wine
and a feather duster.

You sure my Mercedes
is okay parked on the street?

I mean, I gave that crack whore $1 0
to watch it but now I'm thinking...

...who's watching the crack whore?

Don't worry about your car.

Okay.

So where are all the guys?

How come I'm the only weenie
in this pot of beans?

-Because this party is in your honor.
-Really? What did I do?

You're a vessel of the masculine
life force.

You picked up on that?

I tell people that all the time
and they just get snotty.

These women are all my sisters.
They all want to please you.

Well, gosh, that's swell.

-Then you're okay with this?
-lt was my idea.

Let me tell you something, lsabella,
you are just tops in my book.

This is very tasty.
What'd you say this was?

-A secret elixir.
-Secret elixir, huh?

I'm more of a bourbon guy
but push comes to shove...

...I don't know
what the hell's in that either.

Oh, boy.
Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.

Got any crackers?

-He's ready.
-You bet your gothic ass I am.

-Where are we going?
-T o the altar room.

Oh, boy. What's the altar room?

It's where we anoint you.

Oh, boy. I'm getting anointed.

Sounds nasty.

-Anoint him.
-Anoint him.

Anoint him.

Anoint him.

Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

Anoint him. Anoint him.

-Morning.
-Morning.

Great googly-mooglies.

-What the hell happened to you?
-l' m not sure.

Looks like you got bit in the face
by one of them Ebola monkeys.

I don't think so, Berta.

I mean,
you weren't exactly eye-candy going in.

But now:

You could scare the flies
off a manure truck.

Thank you. Until you said that
I was feeling a little self-conscious.

-You know I'm razzing you, don't you?
-Yeah.

I mean, it's really not that-- Oh,
sweet lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos.

Okay, if open-mike night
in the burn ward is over...

...I'm gonna make breakfast and get out
before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.

Why,
is she not as compassionate as me?

She's just a very creepy woman.

Well, putting aside
the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how?

Well, she's got tattoos all over her.

I've got tattoos.

And she's got this very dark,
hostile attitude.

Okay, you might actually like her...

...but I don't want to have anything
to do with her.

Good morning.

Isabella. Hello.

That's a nasty looking eye
you've got there.

It's just a sty.

Right?

What else would it be?

Hey, Vampira...

...tell Count Humpula to get out of bed
so I can change his sheets.

Charlie and I are spending the entire day
in bed.

We do not want to be disturbed.
Do you understand?

Is it getting cold in here?

Do you understand?

Yep. You betcha.

Thank you.

Bye, Alan. Take care of that eye.

I will. Thank you.
You see what I mean about--?

-What are you doing?
-Leaving.

-Why?
-Did you see that bitch?

You gotta put a whole lot of gone
between you and a broad like that.

-But wait a second--
-Goodbye and good luck.

That is some sty.

This is no sty. This is something else.
Something evil.

Something ugly.

You know what? I'm starting to think
your girlfriend did this.

-Oh, come on.
-Charlie, this isn't just about me.

Have you taken a look
at yourself recently?

Oh, man.

It's gonna take more than
a little spray-on tan to fix that.

Do you realize how long
you've been upstairs with her?

-That depends.
-On what?

On what day it is.

It's Sunday evening. I haven't seen you
since you went to that party.

Oh, yeah, the party.

-That was some great party.
-What happened?

I have no idea.

Although, I did wake up with this.

-Oh, my God.
-Am I Jewish now?

Charlie, that's not the Star of David,
it's a pentagram.

It's a satanic symbol
used to call forth demons from hell.

Oh, that's not good.

-You need to cut lsabella loose.
-I can't.

Why not?

Because together we shall spawn
a child named Giglamesh.

And he shall bring forth
a new age of darkness.

You know, maybe it's time to slow
this relationship down a little bit.

Slow it down? You need to drive a stake
through its heart.

-ls she still here?
-Yeah.

Okay, here's the plan.

So we'll submit to her will and serve the
Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.

I'll grab Jake.

You start the car. We'll drive somewhere
safe. I'm thinking the Vatican.

-Don't be ridiculous.
-What are you gonna do?

-You said it. We have to cut her loose.
-"We"? I didn't say "we. "

I never said "we. "

Hear us, oh, Horned One.

Wrap your dark wings
around this young soul...

...and grant him
all the rewards he desires.

Okay, hi, Mr. Horned One.

Here's the deal,
I'll trade you my soul for--

What do I get, like, three wishes?

He's the Lord of the Underworld,
not a genie.

Oh, okay. Can I talk to a genie?

Jake, get over here.

Sorry, Dad,
but you're no longer my master.

The hell I'm not. Go to your room.

I'm old enough
to choose my own religion.

Go.

How dare you interfere?

Good question.

Alan, tell her how we dare.

Hey, you brought her here,
you get her out.

Are you trying to get rid of me?

Okay, well, no, not you personally.

This is more of a legal issue.

It turns out Malibu is not zoned
for satanic rituals.

Or any of the black arts, really.
Right, Alan?

That's true. You're fine in Hollywood.

Pretty much anywhere
east of the 405 freeway, actually.

-Shut up, Alan.
-Just trying to help.

Did you really think
that you can end this?

I was kind of hoping.

Don't you realize that our souls
are now bound together...

...destined to writhe ecstatically
in blessed hellfire for all eternity?

Boy, I know how to pick them,
don't l?

Charlie, do you remember
the vows you took last night?

-Vows?
-You took vows? What kind of vows?

If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.

You vowed unending fealty
to the sisterhood of the coven.

You did that? Why would you do that?

Will you please shut up?

I did that? Why would I do that?

Did you think those beautiful women
were pleasuring you...

...because of your boyish charm?

Well. No, not all of them.

I just figured after the first three or four,
word of mouth started to spread.

Wait, wait, how many women
are we talking about here?

I don't know. Nine, 1 0--

Thirteen. The sacred number.

And a personal best for me.

How do you have sex
with 1 3 women at one time?

Well, apparently,
you have to take some vows.

Okay, okay, listen.

Thank the girls for me,
tell them I had a wonderful time...

...but tell them I have to pass
on the fealty stuff.

I have a previous commitment to,
you know, God.

It doesn't work that way, Charlie.

If you break your vows...

...you bring down upon yourself
the ancient curse of betrayal.

-Well, that's the chance I'll have to take.
-So be it.

So be it.

Just kidding.

Simply out of curiosity,
what exactly is this curse?

What should I be on the lookout for?

-Your crops will wither in the field.
-Yeah, okay.

Your cattle will sicken and die.

Your manhood will shrivel
and become a useless husk.

I gotta fold here, Alan.

Okay, you got me.

What do you say we call the girls over
and start spawning baby Giglamesh?

-Don't do this.
-Hey, when she's shriveling your husk...

...then you get a vote.

Go ahead, call the coven.

Wow, you gals could make a fortune
delivering pizzas.

Mom?

Boo, everybody.

Now, not a word, Charlie.

You're all coming with me
to my costume party...

...and I'm not taking no for an answer.

Evelyn?

Isabella.

You know each other?

In a manner of speaking.

-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

These are my sons.

It was an accident. I had no idea.

Please, believe me.

Goodbye, lsabella.

Yes, goodbye.

-Bye, Charlie.
-Hold on, hold on.

What about the vows,
the curse and the shriveling?

I have no idea what he's talking about.

What? She's in my Pilates class.

-I'll buy that.
-Okay.

Now, are you coming to my party
or you gonna give me a hard time?

-I'm coming to the party.
-Me too.

Jake, come get your costume.

-What's Mom gonna wear?
-Shut up.

Let's go. Grand-mommy doesn't want
to be late to her costume party.

Oh, come on, boys. Sell it.

Very nice.

Now fly, my pets, fly.

I call shotgun.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, this is gonna be so great.

Are you guys as excited as I am?

Probably not.

Okay.

Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

You guys are the best.

Is this a chocolate fudge cake?

You tell us, you brought it.

Make a wish
and blow out the candles.

Oh, right, right.

I wish this was chocolate fudge.

Okay, now it's time for party games.

I've got one.

It's called Drink Until This Night
Makes Some Sort of Sense.

I'll go first.

Nope, not yet.

Round two.

Uncle Charlie?

Go away.

Have you seen my iPod?

No.

What about you, Rose?

No. Sorry, Jake.

Oh, man.

Good morning, sleepyhead.

Morning.

So.

What's new?

That's good coffee.

-Good morning.
-It's getting there.

-Whose birthday cake?
-Rose.

Oh, surprise party?

No, I think she saw it coming.

-Morning.
-Morning.

Hey. Coffee?

Can you make it to go?

T o go?

Yeah, the thing is,
I made a little boo-boo.

-A boo-boo?
-A boo-boo.

Anyway, I may have to leave town
for a few days.

Why? What did you do?

Rose.

What?

I did Rose.

Wait. You had sex with Rose?
Are you insane?

Moot point, Alan.

What I have to do is find my passport
and head for the border.

What you have to do is tell Rose
that I was drunk and l' m sorry...

...and that there's no reason to hunt me
down and glue my testicles to my thigh.

Again.

I'll tell you now, you're swabbing on
your own nail polish remover this time.

That wasn't pleasant
for either of us, Berta.

-What the hell were you thinking?
-Thinking?

There was no thinking.

We had tequila shots,
were talking, having a nice evening...

...and somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

-Somebody?
-lt might have been me.

The next thing I know, Jake
is waking us up looking for his iPod.

Wait, Jake saw you in bed with Rose?

No.

Oh, great, great. That's great.

-What am I gonna tell him?
-Who cares? He's 1 1.

He'll get over it.

I'm the one who still has a bald patch
on my scrotum.

And let me tell you,
the comb-over isn't fooling anybody.

-Morning.
-Oh, hey, look, it's Rose.

-Morning, Rose.
-Hey, birthday girl.

You get anything good last night?

It was a wonderful party.

Isn't that nice.

Can I get you anything?

Coffee, orange juice,
industrial strength adhesive?

No, I can't stay.
I'm having a birthday lunch with my dad.

Well, that's great.
Not that I'm anxious for you to leave.

It's great you're gonna
spend time with dad.

Dads are great. I like the word "dad"
better than "father. "

If Hitler had called Germany
dadland instead of fatherland...

...it would have been
a friendlier country.

-Charlie.
-Y es?

-You're acting crazy.
-Am l?

Hey, if anybody knows.

I understand last night
was just one of those things.

I have no expectations.

Okay. Good.

-And?
-And nothing.

I'll see you later.

-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

Oh, God, it's worse than I thought.

What are you talking about?
She sounded fine.

Berta, tell him.

She's nuts, he's screwed.

-Uncle Charlie?
-Yeah, buddy?

You know what would be cool?
If you and Rose got married.

Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool.

I could be the best man.

Carry the ring for you
and the medication for her.

Do pharmacies have bridal registries?

Hey, have you guys talked
about having kids?

Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of teeny-weeny, crazy-ass feet?

No, he's not gonna marry Rose.

Why not?
He's already getting sex from her.

Jake. Jake,
the only reason Rose was in my bed...

...is because she was
too tired to go home.

Uncle Charlie, I'm an underachiever,
not an idiot.

Okay, fine. You want the truth?

-Charlie, be discreet.
-Because a man and woman have sex...

...doesn't mean they get married
or they see each other.

It doesn't even mean
they have to give their actual names.

Thank you for your discretion.

No, no. It's time somebody
taught him the facts of life.

What facts? That you did a stupid thing
because you're a stupid man?

I was getting to that.

Why was it stupid?

Because he had sex with someone
he doesn't love.

No, no. Because I had sex
with someone...

...who knows how to disable
the alarm system.

And who has no compunction
about shaving my head while I sleep.

-What's a compunction?
-Go get ready for bed.

Sounds dirty.

Just go.

Hey, lady,
I can see your compunction.

-Charlie, do me a favor?
-What?

-Don't talk to my kid about sex.
-Why?

Because you're a pig.

Okay.

-What was that?
-What was what?

It was a thump.

-What do you mean a thump?
-You know, a thump.

Like a woman dressed as a ninja
jumping from a tree...

...and landing on the roof
with cat-like precision.

-I didn't hear anything.
-Well, I did.

I guess your hearing's more acute
when your nuts are on the line.

Come on, you don't really
think Rose is gonna do anything?

Hey, I never told you
half the weird stuff she pulled here.

-Why not?
-We needed a babysitter...

...and I didn't want you
to get spooked.

Okay, I'm listening.

One time she trained a seagull
to swoop down--

Oh, God, this is it.

Come on. I can not believe a grown man
like you is afraid of a little girl.

A little girl with a big seagull.

Went right for my eyes.

You ever seen one of them swoop down
on a picnic table to grab a french fry?

-lt was just like that.
-Charlie.

That's how she trained it.

Took a picture of me
and put french fries all over it.

You're being ridiculous.

Am l?

We'll see.

-Are you Charlie Harper?
-Yes, I am.

I'm Rose's father.

I don't see a way out of this, do you?

So you're Rose's dad.

I can see the resemblance.

You and I need to talk.

Okay, sure, if you want.

I'm booked for the next few days,
but maybe we can next week.

-Now.
-Or now.

There's a window in my schedule.
Come on in.

Thank you.

-Can I get you something to drink?
-I'm fine.

You don't mind if I have
a conversation starter, do you?

-Knock yourself out.
-I'm gonna try.

-So I'm Charlie's brother, Alan.
-Nice to meet you.

Same here.

I never slept with your daughter.

I'm not surprised.

Okay. Rose's dad.

-Call me Harvey.
-Okay, Harvey.

Easy. Like the invisible rabbit
in that Jimmy Stewart movie.

-What was that called?
-Harvey.

Right.

Loved that movie.

People don't know it was originally a play.
Then they tried to make it a musical.

-Charlie?
-Y es, sir?

-Sit down.
-Y es, sir.

Now...

...what are your intentions
towards my daughter?

Oh, right to the chase.
Straight shooter.

I like that.

Thirsty.

So where were we?

He wants to know
what your intentions are towards Rose.

Thank you.

Well, I would have to say
that my intentions are good.

Anybody who knows me
would confirm...

...that "Charlie Harper
has good intentions. "

His actions, on the other hand,
are usually selfish and asinine.

Again, thank you.

Harvey, I'm glad we had this chance
to talk--

-Sit down.
-Sorry.

-You gonna marry my daughter or not?
-Not.

-Not?
-A very well-intended not.

So after two years together, you just
plan to keep on stringing her along?

No, I would never--
Wait a minute, did you say two years?

Now look, Rose cares very much
about you...

...and she's not gonna leave you.

So I think the honorable thing
for you to do is let her go.

Believe me, Harvey, I've tried.

God, how I've tried.

So, what's the problem?
You love her too much?

Not exactly.

I mean, she's a wonderful gal
and I do care for her.

But you see--

What, the peanut gallery taking
a break?

Harvey, the truth is,
Charlie has tried to end it.

But your daughter
doesn't handle rejection well.

Or all that legally.

In my defense, we're not talking
about a long-term relationship.

We're talking about a couple of nights
of drunken, frenzied sex two years apart.

-That's your defense?
-I didn't say it was a good defense.

You'll have to forgive my brother.

He thinks with his penis
and his penis isn't very bright.

That's true. Anybody
who knows me will confirm that.

I can confirm that.

Oh, for God sake.

Rose, did you tell your father
we've been going out for two years?

Yeah. I thought it sounded better
than saying we had a one-night stand...

...and then I stalked you
for two years.

She's not wrong.

Daddy, try to understand.

I didn't want you to feel sorry for me...

...or try to set me up with anybody.
Or have me committed.

Oh, sweetheart,
I would never do that.

We're a wealthy family.
We can afford home care.

Okay, well, I'm glad
we had this chance to clear the air.

I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about
so I'll let you get to it.

-Mom?
-Hang on, dear.

-Hello?
-Alan. Oh, good, I'm glad you're home.

Listen, I'm in the neighborhood
and I know how Charlie hates it...

...when I just drop in unannounced,
so I thought I'd call first.

I'll let him know.

Charlie, Mom's coming over.

Tell her I'm not here.

Hi, sweetie. Oh, hello, Rose.

Hi, Evelyn.
Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn.

-Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey.
-Harvey, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

So, what are we talking about?

Well, Charlie and I got hammered
last night...

...and then somebody suggested
a sponge bath.

It might have been me.

Then we ended up
spending the night together.

I see.

Are you as proud of yours
as I am of mine?

You do the best you can
to raise them...

...but in the end they drive down
life's highway on their own.

Isn't that the truth?

I think God gives us children so death
won't come as such a disappointment.

So, Evelyn...

...are you married?

Not at the moment.

Why? What do you have in mind?

Well, maybe we could start
with a little dinner.

Sounds good.

But how do you wanna finish?

Simultaneously.

Oh, he's good.

Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

-Hold on. Alan?
-Yeah?

Get the door.

Boys, we have a problem.
We need to talk.

-What's going on?
-We haven't seen you in days.

-Not that we're complaining.
-Merely an observation.

Well, as you know,
I have been seeing Rose's father.

-And how's that going?
-At first it was wonderful.

He was handsome, charming,
and a raging bull in the sack.

No mental pictures. Push them out.

Well, don't give them to me.

What I didn't realize...

...is the man has the emotional stability
of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab.

-What did he do?
-It's what he didn't do.

-Okay, what didn't he do?
-Leave.

Now, a couple of days
of Viagra-enhanced boinking...

...and he suddenly thinks
he lives with me.

He's moving my furniture around,
he's getting his mail forwarded...

...he had a satellite dish installed.

Did he get the NFL package?

Charlie, please, this is not funny.

This man is obsessed with me.
He will not let me out of his sight.

Wherever I go, there he is...

...with this stupid love-smitten look
on his face.

You just wanna hit him with a shovel.

Well, what do you want us to do?

Come over to my house
and hit him with a shovel.

Wouldn't it be easier to keep
feeding him Viagra until he strokes?

Charlie, don't be ridiculous.
That could take months.

Come on now, guys, think.

How can I get this loon out
of my house?

-I say we bring in expert help.
-Way ahead of you.

Rose.

-Yes, Charlie?
-Road trip.

Oh, goody, I'll meet you in the garage.

-Daddy?
-Oh, Rose, good.

You got my change-of-address card.

And there's my other favorite gal.

-Hello, Harvey.
-Where were you, pudding pop?

I was worried sick.

-I just went out.
-I didn't see you leave.

That's because I climbed out
the laundry room window.

Aren't you a limber little minx.

Daddy, we need to talk.

Yes, right away, honey.

Hey, fellas,
are you ready for some football?

Evie, why don't you get our guests
some cold drinks?

Yes, of course, dear.

Garden shed. Shovel. Bag of lime.

-Daddy, listen to me very closely.
-Okay.

You don't live here.

Yes, I do. Look at me.

We've been through this before,
remember?

The pretty receptionist
at your psychiatrist's office?

Oh, yeah. Cheryl.

She had a mean lawyer.

But this is different.

Evelyn and I are in love,
we're gonna get married.

Isn't that right?

Not if you were the last crazy man
on Earth.

Guys, feel free to call me Dad.

-No, thank you.
-I couldn't.

Daddy, pay attention.

Okay.

I know what it feels like to be so in love
with someone you wanna crawl inside...

...so that you're wearing their skin
like a leotard with nipples.

What I've learned is that not everyone
is ready for that kind of intimacy.

Take me and Charlie for example.

We slept together two years ago...

...realized we were better as friends,
and haven't done it again since.

-We haven't?
-You were too drunk.

I was gonna tell you eventually.

Then why did you let me think
we did?

Because it doesn't make
any difference.

I'm in this for the long haul.

Sweetheart, when Evie and I get married
Charlie will be your stepbrother.

Oh, I didn't think of that.

Oh, très kinky.

Rose, stick with the plan.

Okay.

Daddy,
I didn't wanna have to do this...

...but I brought someone else here
to talk to you.

-Who?
-Come on in, Grandma.

You brought Mother?

Harvey, how many times
have I told you...

...not to leave the estate
without telling me?

-Mom.
-Playtime's over.

-Get in the car, we're going home.
-But, Mom, we're getting married.

To this trash? I don't think so.

Excuse me?

Roll with it, Mom.

I'm counting to three, Harvey.

One, two--

I'm going, I'm--

-Keep the robe.
-Thanks. I'm not wearing pants.

Harvey, do you want me
to put you over my knee?

All right, I'm going.

He's really a good boy.

But these things happen
when you marry a first cousin.

I'd say they're lucky to have thumbs.

I'm really sorry to impose on you.

I just feel very uncomfortable
being home alone tonight.

-No problem, you sleep in my room.
-Where will you sleep?

I don't know, I'll find somebody.

-I'm beat. I'm gonna go to bed.
-Good night.

-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night, Mom.

Sleep tight, pudding pop.

.......... ********** ..........

Thank you.

Oh, I knew it.
There's no extra foam in my latte.

You ask for extra foam...

...you might as well be asking for
a piggyback ride, know what I mean?

Charlie?

Charlie?

Oh, of course.

Man's got a heat-seeking missile
in his pants.

Is it too much to ask that
when we go out for coffee...

...you stay within earshot, so I'm not
talking to myself like a crazy person?

And again, I'm talking to myself
like a crazy person.

Look.

Yes, I see.

Girl pretty. Charlie like.

No, girl magnificent.

Charlie buy her Lexus.

I thought we were gonna
hang out together...

...but obviously your neurotic need
for sex is more important...

...than spending time
with your only brother...

...who despite everything continues
to love you and is, by the way...

...your best hope for
a viable kidney transplant.

You can get yourself home, right?

What makes you think
that she's even available?

Maybe she's married, maybe she's gay,
maybe she's a guy.

Hey, I don't see a ring,
a girlfriend or a bulge.

If you'll excuse me, it's time to do
that voodoo that I do do so well.

Hi.

-I'm Charlie.
-Don't care.

-And you are?
-Not interested.

How do you know?

I know.

Okay then.

You think it's over?
Because it's not over.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I guess I was mislead by her complete
and utter indifference to you.

Yeah, well, watch and learn.

-So--
-Go away.

How about now? Is it over now?

It's not an exact science, Alan.

Look, if you knew me at all and shut
me down, that would be one thing...

...but to be dismissed on a simple hello,
well, that's a tough pill to swallow.

Would you rather I give it to you
in a suppository?

-Well, to be perfectly honest--
-Goodbye.

-Hey, hey, did you hear that?
-What?

It's a-- It's a fat lady...

...and she's singing.

-You'd give up right now, wouldn't you?
-Charlie, Elvis has left the building.

I think giving up is
a little moot at this point.

Well, that attitude
is why you sleep alone...

...with a copy of Monster Boobs
magazine under your pillow.

Stay out of my room.

Waverly Dance Studio,
3737 Waverly Street.

Got it.

Westwood Academy of Dance,
1 4001 Pico Boulevard.

What's going on?

I'm mapping out
all the dance studios...

-...within a five-mile radius.
-Why?

I can't stop thinking about
that girl I met. I have to find her.

Shame you can't let your penis
sniff a piece of her clothing.

Look, I know her name, Mia.
It was written on her coffee cup.

I know she's a dancer.

She was wearing leg-warmer-thingies
and reading a dance magazine.

Reading a dance magazine
doesn't make you a dancer.

Why not? You're a monster boob.

Will you both stay out of my room.

Tell me, why do you want to
go to all this trouble...

...to track down a girl who showed
less than no interest in you?

A girl who seemed actually repulsed
by your very being.

A girl whose skin visibly crawled
at your mere proximity.

Yeah, but did you see her butt?

It was like a ripe little peach.

That's your answer?
Her ass reminded you of fruit?

Berta, explain it to him.

A lot of the times a peach
will have a subtle cleft in it...

-...that is reminiscent of a woman's--
-No. Thanks.

Thanks, I got the picture.

Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund
Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest?

Because it reminded him
of a big pointy melon?

That's part of the reason,
but the main reason was...

...he wanted to do it because
everyone thought it was impossible.

I'm missing the connection here.

If a girl like Mia were easy to climb...

...her head would be
covered with flags.

-So you're looking for a challenge.
-Exactly.

No one takes a picture of the fish
that jumps on your boat.

I-- I'm confused.
Is she a mountain or a fish?

Doesn't matter,
either way I'm gonna scale her.

And you,
why do you enable this behavior?

Why? I'll tell you why.

Because your brother is the embodiment
of the roll-up-your-sleeves spirit...

...that made this country great.

He never gets discouraged,
he goes after what he wants...

...and he doesn't know
the meaning of quit.

If the day should come when any man,
no matter how humble...

...can't go out there and soil the loins
of some hot little dancer...

...well, I don't wanna live
in that America.

Okay, very good. Now reverse.

Oh, leave me alone.

Keep going.

Hey, you're a teacher.

Hey, you're a stalker.

No, no. I was passing by
and happened to look in the window.

What's the map for?

Oh, this? I had to go to
eight other dance studios...

...before I found the right window.

I suppose that could be
interpreted as stalking...

...but it could be just as easily be seen
as sincerity, persistence--

Mental illness?

Come on, I'm clearly smitten.
Throw me a bone.

-Charlie--
-You remembered my name.

I wrote it down
in case I needed to call the cops.

I don't have time for dating right now.
I'm completely focused on my work.

Well, let's talk about work.
I've always wanted to learn to dance...

-...can you teach me?
-I only teach children.

You don't have a class full of
large, slow kids I could be part of?

All right, how about this.

My nephew loves to dance.

A gifted little boy.
Moves like a gazelle.

-How old is he?
-I don't know, 1 1, 1 2.

It's hard to say, he's got a big head.

Frankly I'd love to have
a boy in the class.

It's hard to get males
excited about ballet.

Jake is just ballet this and ballet that.

Yeah, I'm sure.

Why don't you bring him
by tomorrow?

-Great. Maybe afterwards you and l--
-Charlie, listen carefully.

You and l, never gonna happen.

Understood. See you tomorrow.

Charlie to base camp,
I am beginning my ascent.

How you liking the pizza your old
Uncle Charlie bought for his buddy?

It's good.

Save room, I've got a half-gallon of that
fudge brownie ice cream.

I don't know, I'm pretty stuffed.

-You sure?
-Maybe after I poop.

What are you doing?

-We're eating dinner.
-He had dinner an hour ago.

-Well, then he won't need breakfast.
-Yes, I will.

You've had enough to eat.

Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do
after a nice big meal?

-What?
-Learn to dance.

-Charlie.
-Yeah?

Private word.

Sure.

-What's up?
-Shame on you.

Is that it?

You found that girl...

...and now you have a plan
to use my son as bait.

Yeah, so? It's not like he pays rent.
Why shouldn't he pitch in a little?

I will not allow it.

Come on, it's just a couple
of ballet lessons.

Ballet? Him?

I think he has a quiet grace about him.

He doesn't have to be good,
he just has to show up.

One lesson, I'm begging you.

You know what,
it really doesn't matter what I say.

You will never convince him
to take ballet.

If I can, will you stay out of it?

-I guess.
-Great.

Hey, Jake.

Okay, that might have been
bad parenting on my part.

I've got a surprise for you.

It's not more food, is it?

Because I'm starting to feel
a little dizzy.

You're gonna get to do something
that no other boy in your class has done.

If it's sex, Mitchell Fineman
already saw his cousin naked.

-No, this is better than sex.
-What?

How would he know?

-You're gonna learn to dance ballet.
-Wanna bet?

Okay, let me put it this way.

How much money would I have to give
you to take ballet lessons?

-I want $1 0.
-Wait, hold on.

I want $1 000.

That's really unethical.

Oh, yeah, I'm the one
on shaky moral ground.

-Okay, I'll give you $500.
-Split the difference.

-Two-fifty.
-Done.

Come on, let's go.

I changed my mind.

You took my money.

I'll give it back.

Jake, we're here.
You may as well give it a try.

Yeah, give it a try.
Who knows, you might like it.

I will never forgive you for this.

You didn't tell me
I'd be the only boy here.

So? The odds are on your side.

The odds for what? I'm 1 1.

-I wanna go home.
-I thought we had a deal.

You can't make him stay
if he doesn't want to.

I love you, Dad.

All right, let's get started.

-Who's that?
-Your teacher.

-Come on, let's go.
-Hang on, Dad.

Maybe we should give this a chance.

Hi, I'm Jake.

-Hi, Jake. It's nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

-Your uncle tells me you like ballet.
-Yeah.

Okay. How about you
line up with the girls...

-...and we'll get started.
-Yeah.

How about that?

He's got a crush.

It's like watching a dog chase a car.

He'll never catch it, and even if he did,
he couldn't drive it.

He's still doing better than you.

Everyone, I'd like you to meet
our new student Jake.

-Hi, Jake.
-Yeah, hi.

Okay, let's start in first position.
Jake, do you know first position?

Is that like the missionary position?

And one, and two...

...and three, and four.

I will never forgive you for this.

What? He's having a great time.

The clueless knucklehead.

Okay, very nice, class.

Yeah, good hustle, everybody.

Much better, Jake.

-That's because I have a good teacher.
-Thank you.

All right, that's it for this week.

Remember, life is a dance,
live it gracefully.

That's my motto.

Well, that settles it.

I wanna be a ballet dancer
when I grow up.

Really? There's a load off my mind.

It's not as easy as it looks.
It's pretty hard.

Yeah. It's pretty hard to watch.

Thanks.

Did you see how far Mia
could put her leg over her head?

I did notice that, yes.

So, what do you think,
Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone?

-He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
-He gets that from me.

I thought you were his uncle.

That's the whole
nature and nurture debate, isn't it?

-So listen, Mia--
-I'm not going out with you.

I know, you made it very clear.

My question was is there anything more
we can do to help Jake?

Extra classes? Private tutoring?

The three of us in Cabo
for a long weekend?

If he comes to class regularly,
I think you'll be amazed at his progress.

Good, I'd hate to think he's peaked.

We're having a recital next month...

...and with a lot of work and
a little luck, we can include him.

Charlie to base camp...

...pretty cold up here, visibility zero.

Call me.

Okay.

I hope you like this.

It's an impertinent little cabernet
with oaky overtones...

...and just the hint of a floral finish.

-Wow, you really know your wines.
-I just read it off the box.

What's the plan? Get me drunk
and take advantage of me?

Oh, good, you've done this before.

I had a very nice time tonight.

Was it worth all the trouble
I put you through?

You tell me.

Ask me again in the morning.

Charlie to base camp.

I can see the summit.

-Hey.
-Hey, Jake.

-What are you doing up?
-Why shouldn't I be up?

Isn't it past your bedtime?

I don't know
what you're talking about.

-I don't have a bedtime.
-Okay.

-So, what's going on?
-Not too much.

Where's your dad?

I don't know,
why don't you go look for him?

Look, Jake, Mia and l
are kind of busy right now.

-Busy doing what?
-Talking.

Okay. What are we talking about?

We are not talking about anything.
You're going to bed.

Why don't we let Mia decide?

Jake, I think you should go to bed.

Are you sure?
You don't have to decide right now.

Your uncle and I would like to spend
some alone-time together.

All right.

You want me to tuck you in?

I'm too old to get tucked in, you--
You ass-face.

Okay, then, sleep tight, little camper.

Kids, huh?

Yeah, kids.

He never called me
an ass-face before.

-I think he's a little jealous.
-Yeah.

I remember feeling like that...

-...when I was his age.
-Really?

Cafeteria lady.

Looked like Valerie Bertinelli...

...but, you know, with a hairnet and
just the cutest whisper of a mustache.

She didn't know I was alive.

You poor thing.

I'm sorry, Mia. I can't--
I can't do this to him.

Do what to him?

One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady
holding hands...

...with the shop teacher
in the parking lot...

...and it just killed me.

Mr. Dinapoli. I'll never forget it.

She was holding the hand
with the missing thumb.

You know what,
I've gotta take you home.

-I understand.
-You do?

You love Jake.

You'd rather give up spending the night
with me than risk hurting him.

Right.

Although when you spell it out like that,
it sounds incredibly stupid.

You're a very sweet man.

Thank you.

I was kidding. Let's go upstairs.

Charlie, take me home.

Let's talk about this.
He's 1 1, he'll get over it.

I got over one-thumb Dinapoli.

You asleep?

-You can quit faking, I took her home.
-Really?

-Yeah.
-How come?

It's part of the guy code.

When two friends like the same girl,
one of them has to step aside.

Unless she's a good sport, then it's
like Saturday morning at the bakery.

It's a complicated code.

Don't worry about it.

Bottom line is,
I'm out of the Mia business.

Cool.

Now, go to sleep.

-Uncle Charlie?
-Yeah?

I'm sorry I called you an ass-face.

Oh, yeah.

I forgot about that.

No woman is worth this.

I am so proud.

Our little boy is growing up.

.......... ********** ..........

-Jake?
-Yeah?

-Are you praying?
-It's okay. I'm not in school.

No, no, it's fine.
What are you praying for?

I have a math test on Monday.

Oh, so you're praying
for a good grade?

No, that never works.

I'm praying for the teacher
to get sick.

Have you considered just studying
for the test?

How would that help?

Okay, listen to me.

Even if we were to assume a God
who would be willing...

-...to give your teacher a cold--
-Anthrax.

-All right, that's it. No more praying.
-What are you, the Supreme Court?

How do you know
about the Supreme Court?

This guy on TV, Reverend Don.
He talks to God.

He said you should pray
to strike down your teacher?

No, activist judges.

But I figured why can't it work
on Ms. Stanley?

You know what else,
If I send Reverend Don money...

...God will make me rich.

And did you send him money?

Wouldn't you?

No. God doesn't make people rich.

And even if he did,
it wouldn't make you happy.

Well, I disagree.

Jake.

Reward without effort is meaningless.

Money alone will not
give you fulfillment.

What about Uncle Charlie?

He seems fulfilled
and he doesn't do anything.

Hey, hey, let me tell you
about your Uncle Charlie.

He puts on a happy face,
but on the inside he is a sad, lonely man.

You see?

I'm about to do a load of laundry.

Last chance to change
your underwear.

I'm good.

Hold off on the washing machine.

I think Charlie and his friend
are still in the shower.

I'll check.

You were right.

I wouldn't wait for me to get that.

-Hello.
-Hello.

We haven't met.
I'm Norma Seabury from next door.

Oh, it's nice to finally meet you.
I'm Alan Harper.

Harper?
Are you related to that dreadful Charlie?

My mother says I am, but frankly,
I have my doubts I'm related to her.

Well, Alan, there's a little red sports car
blocking my driveway.

I assume it belongs to one
of your brother's whores.

-One of his what?
-Whores.

Ever since he moved in here,
it's been one endless parade of whores.

Oh, whores.

Well, in all fairness...

...most of them don't have
the math skills to be whores.

Be that as it may,
I'm late for my hair appointment...

...and I want that car moved
immediately.

Absolutely. I am so sorry.

Let me track down
the whore in question...

...and ask her to move it.

Thank you.

-God bless you.
-He'd better, I sent in 5 bucks.

Charlie, we have a situation.

Okay, that looks pretty clean.
Now do me.

This is so unfair.

Excuse me.

Not now, Alan. I'm making bubbles.

I don't care what her name is.

Her car is blocking
our neighbor's driveway.

Oh, sorry, I'll move it.

You can't go now, you're busy.

Oh, yeah. I'm busy.

All right, just tell me where the keys are
and I'll move it.

Oh, gosh, no.
I don't let strange men touch my car.

Oh, good, at least you have respect
for your car.

Alan, do we need to have
another boundaries talk?

No, I'm leaving.

Look what's dirty again.

Okay, I have located the owner
of the sports car.

Is she going to pull it out?

Not for a while.

Well, how am I supposed to
get to my hair appointment?

Well, gee, I'd say that
you really don't need one.

I mean, I think your hair
looks lovely as it is.

Well, aren't you sweet?

Are you homosexual?

No, just sweet.

You don't have to miss
your appointment. I'll drive you.

-You would do that for me?
-lt'd be my pleasure.

Sure you're not homosexual?

Positive.

You would have made a good one.

-Going home already?
-No, I'm going to the opera.

They can't end it until I sing.

There's no call for sarcasm.

No.

-What's up?
-What is that old witch doing here?

Old witch? She's--
She's a charming woman.

Of course she's charming.
They all are.

That's how they lure you into
their houses made of gingerbread.

What exactly is the deal between you?

-Why do you hate her?
-Why don't ask her why she hates me.

She told me you're a horrible neighbor
who doesn't care about anyone.

There you go. How can I like somebody
who talks about me like that?

Hello, Mr. Harper.

Hey, Norma.

Eat any little kids lately?

I could ask you the same thing.

Oh, and by the way...

...will she be moving her car
out of my driveway any time soon?

Maybe people wouldn't park
in your driveway...

...if you didn't put your trash
in my guest parking spot.

You don't have a guest parking spot.

There's no such thing
as a guest parking spot.

It's called a curb
and it belongs to the city of Malibu.

Hey, if I can pass out on it,
I figure it's mine.

Well, by that logic, l--

I guess you own my doghouse too.

That only happened once
and Bruno was fine with it.

Alan...

...thank you so much
for a wonderful day.

I'm looking forward to next Saturday.

Oh, me too.

And as for you, Mr. Harper...

...Bruno never had fleas
before that night.

You passed out in her doghouse?

Hey, I've passed out in wheelbarrows,
but this isn't about me.

-Oh, really? Who is it about?
-You.

Why are you dating a woman who
lost her virginity during World War ll?

And knowing her,
probably not to one of our guys.

First of all, we are not dating.
I'm escorting her to a charity event.

Second of all, her age is irrelevant.

The only thing that matters
is what's inside.

The only thing inside her is dust
and undigested mastodon meat.

She's isn't that old, Charlie.

Come on,
I bet she was an eyewitness...

-...to the birth of agriculture.
-Stop it.

Her high school graduation picture's
probably on a cave wall in France.

Are you done?

Her prom theme was "Fire".

Charlie, I can't figure out
how to turn off the shower.

There's so many knobs.

That's okay. Just dry off
and I'll take care of it.

Thanks.

How does it feel dating a woman
whose lQ is the same as her age?

I could ask you the same thing.

Oh, here's something else
we have in common.

Both our girls are pruney...

...but mine's gonna plump back up
in a little while.

Well, thank you for a lovely evening.

Oh, no, thank you for taking me.

I so loathe going to these things
by myself.

And dancing.

I can't remember
the last time I danced.

That was fun.

One more spin?

Okay, sure.

Thank you for being so kind
to a lonely old gal.

Stop saying that. You are not old.
You're a vibrant fascinating woman.

-I had a great time with you tonight.
-Likewise.

And I want you to give some serious
thought to my offer.

I will, I will.

Okay, so-- So good night.

Good night.

All right.

-Morning.
-Morning.

Who sent the flowers?

I'll give you a hint.

-Wait until you see the card.
-You read the card?

I couldn't. It's in Aramaic.

Okay, I get it. She's old.

It was delivered by
a Roman centurion.

Oh, jeez, I've got a problem.

If you got her pregnant,
we can get a full page in Ripley's.

Give it a rest, Charlie.

Come on, I've been
working on these all morning.

Listen to this.

Her first car was a chariot.

She called her first husband "Hun"
because he was one.

Her first Christmas
was the first Christmas.

Likes to take long walks
on the beach...

...after crawling out of the ocean
and growing legs.

Her birthstone is lava.

And finally, the big bang....

I don't have a joke for that yet,
but I know there's something.

I'm leaving.

Oh, come on, I'm your brother.
You can talk to me.

Okay, I promise, no more jokes.

-Tell me what the problem is.
-Okay.

Well, you know she's rich, right?

Richer than God...

...who she's known
since he was yay high.

You promised.

Sorry, yeah. Yeah.

Well, last night Norma made me
a business proposition.

I'll bet it involved--

No. No. No.
No telegraphs, no flying machines.

No Niña, no Pinta,
no Santa Maria.

You don't have to bite my head off.

I was talking about what I do
for a living...

...and she said she wanted
to invest in me.

Invest in you? How?

She wants to buy a building...

...and create
the Alan Harper Healing Center.

Chiropractics, acupuncture,
holistic pharmacy, aromatherapy--

Why don't you just call it
the Alan Harper House of Crap?

Norma chose the name.

I see.

And in exchange for all this,
she expects you to:

Well, nothing has been
said explicitly, but...

...yeah.

-And you're considering it?
-No. No, of course not.

-Not really.
-Not really?

Well, the building would be
in Beverly Hills...

...and it would have
my name on the top.

Big letters but with a real classy font.

I'm thinking Helvetica.

Okay, I see your dilemma.

-We gotta think this through.
-Thanks, thanks. I really need to.

You'd do her for free
if she was young and beautiful, right?

Well, sure, l-- I suppose.

And you'd stick your dingus
in a beehive...

...for, say, a hundred million,
wouldn't you?

A hundred million dollars? Probably.

But where are we going with this?

We've established
that you're a manwhore...

...now we're just trying to zero in
on your price.

Charlie, you're not helping at all.

Alan, did you really think I would?

-Good to see you again, Ms. Seabury.
-Thank you, Bobby.

-My pleasure.
-Thank you.

Good luck.

Go away, Bobby.

So, Alan...

...have you given any more thought
to my little business proposal?

Well, actually, I have and--

Oh, wait, I forgot.

I brought you a little gifty.

Oh, no, Norma, plea--
You've been too kind already--

Oh, my God, a Rolex.

-A platinum Rolex.
-A platinum Rolex.

I have always wanted
a platinum Rolex.

I almost bought one for myself,
but silly me...

...I got health insurance
for family instead.

-Let me put it on you.
-Okay.

It's-- It's a lot heavier
than my calculator Swatch.

I'm glad you like it.

Champagne for madame...

...and her special friend.

Hey, Bobby, look.

Very nice, sir.

This is too much. I can't accept this.

Oh, I think you can.

Yeah, I probably can.

A toast.

To the Alan Harper Healing Center.

-Okay.
-And to us.

To us as-- As business partners
and friends, right?

Wrong.

-Alan?
-What?

I proposed a toast.

Oh, yes. I'm sorry, it's just...

-...this is all happening so fast.
-Y es.

Well, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

The question is, Alan...

...what do you want?

Hurry up, sugar buns.
I'm not getting any younger.

Charlie.

Wake up.

What? What's wrong?

I had sex with Norma.

-What?
-I gave in.

I folded.

I let her have her way with me.

How was it?

Actually...

...it was great.

She...

...knew stuff.

-ls that a Rolex?
-Yeah.

Platinum.

Nice.

And you get a building in Beverly Hills.
Not bad for a night's work.

Well, actually, l-- I don't think
I'm gonna be getting the building.

She reneged?

She died.

You're kidding.

After we were done...

...she looked at me...

...mumbled a couple of words,
closed her eyes and then:

Dead.

That's it. I knew there was
a big bang joke.

I mean, I'm sorry.

I just can't believe it.

Me neither.

After all those years of
making me miserable...

...she's actually gone.

It's weird, l-- I feel a little sad.

Imagine how I feel.

Yeah, you killed her.

So, what did she mumble
before she, you know....

Well, I'm not sure,
but I think she said:

"l want my watch back. "

Hey, I tried my best
to keep up with her.

I've been up half the night
with the police and the coroners.

You have no idea how judgmental
those people are.

You can't worry about
what anyone else thinks, Alan.

The thing you gotta remember
and keep close to your heart is...

...I get an extra parking space
and you get to keep the watch.

Enjoy it, buddy.

But how can I enjoy it?

The same way I enjoy
that grand piano downstairs.

What does your piano have any--

Wait a minute. Are--

Are you saying that--?
That you slept with Norma?

Hey, I needed a piano.

So-- So if you slept with Norma,
why did she hate you so much?

Probably because
I only needed one piano.

You're right, though.

She did know stuff.

Hey, can you put on channel 84?
I wanna watch Reverend Don.

Well, I wanna watch football.

It's the Lord's day.

Yeah, but it's my TV.

-Who'd you bet on?
-Packers minus one and a half.

If the Vikings don't score,
I'm up a grand.

Okay.

What are you doing?

Praying for the Vikings to score.

Don't do that. Are you crazy?

-Change the channel to Reverend Don.
-No.

Then you leave me no choice.

Okay, you wanna play that way? Fine.

It won't work.
God answers kids' prayers first.

-Who told you that?
-Nobody. It just makes sense.

That last drive put the Vikings
in field goal range.

Oh, God, oh, God.

T oo little, too late.

Here comes the Vikings kicking unit
out onto the field.

Pray for my side I'll give you
a piece of my winnings.

-How much?
-Five percent.

No deal.

Edinger has yet to miss
from this distance.

-Okay, 1 0.
-Twenty.

-Twenty?
-And there 's the snap.

-Deal.
- The kick is up.

-It's good.
-Oh, no.

Don't blame me. You' re a sinner.

.......... ********** ..........

Pretty fancy prices here.

Yeah, well, just so we're clear,
I am picking up the tab tonight.

-Okay.
-This is my celebration. I invited you.

Fine.

-So don't go grabbing the check.
-I won't touch the check.

If you wanna leave the tip,
that'd be okay.

I could do that.

I usually leave 1 5 percent...

...but if you wanna leave 20,
that's your call.

Thank you.

Unless you think it's easier
if we just split the check.

Whatever.

Of course, in many families if someone
is celebrating some good news...

...his brother would insist
on buying dinner.

-Then why don't I do that.
-But I'll leave the tip.

-One question.
-What?

-Do you have any money?
-No.

I left my wallet at home.

You mean this wallet?

Oh, good, you found it.

I was looking all over.

So where did we leave things?
You're paying, we're splitting?

Oh, just shut up.

What's this good news
you're celebrating?

It's a surprise.
I wanna wait till Mom gets here.

Yes, Jake, we see the spoon
on your nose, now stop it.

Can you do it?

I don't want to do it.
Now, behave yourself.

Oh, work with me.

Just wonderful.

You pick a restaurant
that has no valet.

I had to park three blocks away...

...and then schlep here in shoes
that are not for walking.

I've got a blister the size
of a Communion wafer.

And if Mommy doesn't get
something to drink immediately...

...things are going to get very ugly.

Let the celebration begin.

Maybe the lesson here, Mom, is to buy
shoes that are made for walking.

Is it just me?

In a perfect world, it would be.

Well, anyway I'm here. So, what's
your big announcement, Alan?

Jake, get that spoon off your nose.

-You don't know where it's been.
-It's been on my nose.

You really must start looking
at trade schools for the boy.

Now that we are all here,
I have some good news to share.

This is not gonna be on the
newsstands for a couple of days...

... but I have an advance copy.

"Good doctor, good neighbor,
good guy. "

Good God.

-Hey, Dad, you're famous.
-Well, not really.

Well, among the readers of the
Tarzana Pennysaver, maybe a little.

Don't forget the homeless people
who make underpants out of it.

Charlie, don't be disrespectful.

Thank you, Mom.

So how much advertising did you have
to buy in exchange for this puff piece?

Why do you assume
that I had to buy advertising?

Is it that hard to believe that a local
newspaper might run a cover story...

...about a successful
local chiropractor?

Well, frankly, yes.

Unless the chiropractor shot four
people to death in a mini-mart...

...and then turned
the weapon on himself.

You know, I get why Charlie has never
acknowledged my accomplishments.

He's a hedonist
who can't get behind anyone...

...unless they're drunk
and bent over a pool table.

That's fair.

But my own mother--

You're up.

Refusing to even feign interest.

I did so feign interest.

You assumed I had to buy advertising
to get the article.

Well, did you?

Neighborhood advertising
is a good investment.

-But that is not the point.
-All right, what is the point?

The point is, I can't even get
a simple attaboy from own my mother.

Oh, well, I'm sorry.

Attaboy.

Feel better?

-No, I do not feel better.
-Did I not say it right?

You know what? Forget it.
Let's just order, eat and get out of here.

One more of these,
and please keep them coming.

I'll buy the drinks.
Unless you wanna split it with me.

And you know what else?
You know what else?

No, Alan, what else?

I cannot believe that our mother
made us carry her to her car...

...just because she had a teeny-weeny
little blister on her foot.

Well, hopefully the next time we have
to carry her she'll be in a handy urn.

I'll pay for the urn
if you get the cremation.

Done.

-Jake? Where's my son?
-Right here, Dad.

Oh, oh, good, good.

Now, listen, boy.

Your old dad
is not going to be here for--

Is not going to be here forever.

And when I'm gone...

...I want there to be no doubt
in your mind...

...that I was as proud as punch...

...about all of your accomplishments,
no matter how miniscule.

Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you?

No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed.

He just gets a little:

Anyway, the important thing
for you to know...

...is how much I love you.

You told the waiter you loved him too.

He was a very good waiter.

And it's also important for you to know
that you can be anything you want.

Anything in the world.

-No, I can't.
-You're right. That's a crock.

But I love you...

...and you have cheeks like a beaver.

Now go to bed.

Dad, we've been learning
about alcohol abuse at school.

And if you ever need a new liver
you can have half of mine.

Hey, hey, hey.
I thought we had a deal.

Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.

Best 5 bucks I ever spent.

Now come on, let's tuck you into bed.

Why can't my mother appreciate me?
All I wanted was one sincere attaboy.

Was that too much to ask?

Attaboy.

Well, that looks like the last
of the scallops.

Now all we gotta do
is wait for dessert.

Rainbow sherbet.

Oh, that should be pretty.

You know, I have spent
my entire life...

...trying to please Mom
to make her proud of me.

But no more.

I am done trying.

Good for you.

Oh, excuse me.

Nope.

You know, if you put the seat down,
it's easier to rest your arms.

Oh, you're right.

You're a wise man, Charlie Harper.

Well, I do have a few pockets
of specialized knowledge.

Some might call it wisdom.

And it seems warmer too.

It's further away from the cooling effect
of the water.

Not to mention the residual body heat
accrued from thousands of ass hours.

You've really given a lot of thought
to this.

I'm thinking of writing a book.

And I will read it.

Thank you.

You know what I am, Charlie?

Yes.

I am a pathological people pleaser.

I had an entirely different answer.

But more accurately,
I am a woman pleaser.

No, Alan, I am a woman pleaser.

You're a lonely guy
speckled with vomit.

No, I'm not speaking physically,
I'm speaking psychologically.

With Mom.

With Judith.

With every woman I've ever met.

I have twisted myself into knots
just trying to get them to like me.

My education...

...my job, my clothes, my car...

...my very behavior.

All chosen simply to get women
to approve of me.

And how's that worked out for you?

They don't approve of me.

But I am going to change, Charlie.

I am no longer going to grovel
for Mom's approval...

...or for the approval of any woman.

I am going to live the remainder
of my life...

...with pride...

...and a quiet, noble dignity.

But first, I'll sleep with my head
in the crapper.

Can I make you some oatmeal?

I've got cereal.

I know.

I just thought you might enjoy
something hot...

...and quiet.

Nope.

Do you have a hangover?

Yeah.

Drinking that much
was a stupid thing to do.

So then why'd you do it?

I don't know, Jake.

-Maybe I'm just stupid.
-Or maybe you just don't apply yourself.

Can we stop talking for a while?

Okay.

Although I do like a little conversation
at breakfast.

Morning, everybody.

He's hung-over.

Oh, yeah.

Well, isn't this an ironic turn
of events?

Me, waking up feeling
all bright and chipper.

And you looking like a stool sample.

Not a big irony fan, huh?

-Charlie?
-Yeah.

Either stop talking or at least
have the decency to kill me.

-Boy, I'm never gonna drink.
-Good job.

You scarred the kid for life.

Now he's gonna have to face
junior high sober.

-Just tell me one thing.
-What's that?

Did I really tell the waiter
I loved him last night?

You had to say something
after a kiss like that.

Oh, God.

-I took care of your bathroom.
-Thank you.

I hope you like the smell
of pine-scented puke.

So did I do anything else
I'm gonna regret?

-Well, you paid for dinner.
-Jeez.

And after we got home there was some
drunken blubbering...

...about how you weren't
going to grovel for women.

Oh, right. I almost forgot.

I had a life-changing epiphany
last night.

Before or after you yakked up
a hunk of your esophagus?

No, no, it's no joke.

I've reached a turning point.

From this day on, my actions
will no longer be predicated...

...on pleasing the castrating
mother figures in my life.

-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

I think she doubts your epiphany.

She'll see.

They'll all see.

Starting now, I am a new Alan.

Oh, damn, I think I wet myself.

Starting now, I will fear
no woman's disapproval.

Oh, God, that's Judith. I was supposed
to have Jake ready. She's gonna kill me.

Okay, starting now.

Good for you.

-Oh, I better get that.
-Let her wait.

What she thinks of you doesn't matter.
What counts is what you think of you.

You're right.

It's what I think of me.

-Alan?
-I had so much potential.

Okay, forget what you think of you.

Yeah, I'm probably too close to me
to see me clearly.

Yeah, that's it.

Oh, do I smell like vomit?

Don't worry, I'll stand next to you.
She'll assume it's me.

Good, good.

Hi, Alan. Jake ready?

-No, he is not.
-You said you'd have him ready.

Well, I don't.

And if that makes you unhappy with me,
well, I don't give a rat's furry ass.

-What did you just say to me?
-Nothing, I'm sorry. Jake.

-Starting now?
-Starting soon.

You know what that smell is?

Epiphany for men.

So how long you been
in Los Angeles?

About eight months.
Haven't got a single audition yet.

Yeah, this can be a tough town
when you don't know anybody.

So do you have
like a headshot or a résumé?

-ls he okay?
-I don't know.

Sir, are you okay?

-I thought we came here to talk.
-Not to each other.

-Let's talk. What's bothering you?
-I changed my mind...

-...I don't wanna talk about it.
-Talk or die.

All right. I'm depressed.

I wanna change but I can't.
Whenever I'm confronted...

...by a disapproving woman,
something inside me crumbles.

Well, Alan,
maybe that's just who you are.

You know, fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly, you gotta crumble.

What I don't understand
is I can intellectually see the problem...

...but I just can't do anything about it.

Excuse me. Can I have more
of these little pretzels?

-ln a minute.
-Okay, sorry. No hurry.

Look, it's very simple.

You were conditioned
to seek Mom's approval.

You're still seeking Mom's approval...

...and you make every woman
a substitute mom.

But what about you?
We had the same mother.

I handle my conditioning
in a different way.

I have casual and often degrading sex
with my substitute moms...

...but we're talking about you
and not me so forget I said that.

Oh, how I'll try.

But how do you deal with the fear
of disapproval?

I mean, you must get
shot down occasionally.

Occasionally? Constantly.

Constantly?

Occasionally.

It's a numbers game, Alan.

We all want the shiny apple
on top of the tree.

But sometimes you gotta settle
for one on a lower branch.

Of course, there's times you pick up
whatever's lying on the ground...

...and put it in your mouth.

But how do you manage to keep going
on in the face of constant rejection?

Occasional rejection.

Okay, lesson one:

Look around.

Out of all the women here, which one
do you find the most attractive?

Let's see.

Her.

The brunette? Why?

I don't know,
there's just something about her.

-Yeah, radiating waves of contempt.
-You asked me who I found attractive.

That's true.

She's your shiny apple. Now go
ask her if you can buy her a drink.

What about the radiating waves
of contempt?

That's just a defense mechanism
for a girl in a lot of pain.

-Really?
-How the hell should I know?

The point is, you can't let fear
stand in your way.

-Well, I disagree.
-Are you questioning my methods?

-Because we can stop right now.
-No, no, I'll do it. I'll do it.

Would you like some more pretzels?

Well, I am in the mood
for something salty and twisted.

-You're terrible.
-You have no idea.

-How'd it go?
-She's really got a mouth on her.

So she rejected you?

With anatomical specificity.

-Good.
-Good? How is that good?

-How do you feel now?
-What do you mean, how do I feel?

-I feel humiliated.
-Where?

-What?
-Where is the humiliation?

-Where do you feel it?
-Oh, well, let's see.

My stomach's all knotted, my heart is
pounding, I'm sweating like a pig.

Okay, end of lesson one.

That was lesson one?
Lesson one sucked.

Lesson two: Have a drink.

No, sweetheart, have a real drink.

-I don't like Scotch.
-It's okay, it's bourbon.

Oh, all right.

More.

How do you feel now?

-I feel a little better.
-Finish the drink.

Can I put some diet Sprite in it?

Just finish it.

There you go. Now how do you feel?

I feel pretty good.

Like, to hell with her.
Who cares what she thinks?

Perfect.

Now go ask that chick over there
if you can buy her a drink.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
that's your big secret? Alcohol?

Don't tell anybody.

-lsn't that just a temporary solution?
-It's only temporary if you stop drinking.

I like it.

Diet Sprite.

I gotta hand it to you, Alan.

Most guys would be off scallops
for a long time.

I like scallops.

But clearly they don't like you.

I guess you choose your seafood
like you choose your women.

I beg to differ.

When it comes to women,
I make them sick.

Fair enough.

So, what else did we learn tonight?

Well, let's see.

I learned that to overcome my fear
of rejection ingrained in me...

...by an emotionally distant mother...

...I need to completely disable
my central nervous system...

...with semi-lethal quantities
of alcohol.

Bravo.

Hey, Charlie, are you coming to bed
or what?

I'll be there in a second.

-What're you looking at?
-Sorry. Very sorry.

So how've you been?

It worked.

I am totally humiliated
and I don't care.

You made real progress tonight.
I'm proud of you.

Thanks, Charlie. You're a good teacher
and a good brother.

Thanks.

Well, I guess it's time for me
to go work out my issues.

Good night, pal.

Nighty-night.

.......... ********** ..........

-Charlie?
-Yeah?

We said
we were gonna take things slow.

We did say that.
I guess we can't be trusted.

-Charlie, talk to me.
-All right.

You know what I'm gonna do to you,
you dirty, filthy girl?

-No, not like that.
-Wrong way? Am I a dirty, filthy boy?

No, I wanna talk about us.

We're a dirty, filthy couple.

No,
I wanna talk about our relationship.

Well, that redirects the old blood flow.

Okay, so what about it?

-You know that I really care about you.
-And I care about you too.

All right, good talk.

I just wanna make sure
that if we do this...

...we're doing it for the right reasons.

Well, not to be contrary, but the wrong
reasons kick everything up a notch.

I just wanna make sure...

...we give our relationship
a chance to grow.

-So you want to stop?
-No, I really want you.

Mia, all this starting and stopping
is really not good for my transmission.

I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. I--

That's why you're gonna have to
make this decision for both of us.

Me? I have to make this decision?

That's like asking the fat kid
to guard the pie.

I trust you, Charlie.

Well, that is really low.

-Okay, we'll wait.
-Thank you.

-So, what do we do now?
-We could take a walk on the beach.

No, seriously.

Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great.

I've always been meaning to do that.

Good morning, everyone.

-Good morning.
-Looks to be a beautiful day.

Overcast, but that should burn off
in a few hours...

...Ieaving us
with a sun-dappled afternoon in paradise.

You still drunk from last night
or did you get a fresh buzz this morning?

No, ma'am,
I am quite simply high on life.

Blotto.

I am not drunk.
Alan, guess what I did last night.

-Jake.
-I'm leaving.

No, Jake can hear this.

-Last night--
-Wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie.

You're about to tell us something
that made you happy?

-Yes.
-Jake.

I'm leaving.

Jake, stay. I want to share this
with my entire family.

Okay, I'm leaving.

Berta,
I consider you part of my family.

-Am I in your will?
-No, but neither are the rest of them.

Now listen.

Last night, l, Charlie Harper,
delayed gratification.

What did you do,
wait till she fell asleep?

-Wait for what?
-Jake.

-I'm leaving.
-Sit down.

What happened last night is I may
have started a meaningful relationship.

Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off.
You're embarrassing yourself.

Come on, listen to me.

-I think I might be in love with Mia.
-Big deal.

You've always been in love
with you-a.

-Very funny.
-I thought so. Did you think so?

-That was pretty good.
-Yeah.

He's 1 1. He still thinks
"Milk Milk Lemonade" is funny.

Oh, yeah.

Hello? Grandmommy's here.

Oh, great.
Tell Mom what you told us, Charlie.

No.

-Tell me what?
-Nothing.

-Do you need a good lawyer?
-No.

-Discreet doctor?
-No.

-Knock-off Gucci handbag?
-What?

There's only so many ways
I can help you, dear.

It's no big deal. I've just been seeing
this ballet dancer. She might be the one.

Drunk?

He says, "No. "

I think it might be
one of those designer drugs.

Charlie, what did you take?

I'm serious. We've been
seeing each other for over a month.

We're waiting to sleep together until
our relationship has a solid foundation.

Well, we can rule out ecstasy.
I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac.

I've heard.

Nowadays you're supposed to say
"African American-disiac. "

-Jake.
-You sure this time?

-Yeah.
-I'm leaving.

Has it occurred to you
that maybe I've finally matured?

Maybe I'm ready to build something
with a woman...

...that isn't solely based on sex?

-Has that occurred to you?
-No.

Berta?

So it's not just me.

You know,
I can understand your skepticism.

I've earned it.
But this girl is different.

And I'm gonna make it work.

I give him another week before he's out
on the beach, humping wet sand.

-Hey.
-Hey.

How was your date?

Fun.

We went bowling.

Still playing it slow?

Ketchup slow.

Glacier slow.

Continental drift slow.

-So slow?
-I'm saying.

Hey, listen.

About this living without sex thing. I was
hoping you can give me a little advice.

Me?
What would make you think of me?

Well, I figure you get laid less often
than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right?

I don't have the actual statistics,
but go on.

Well, you must get really frustrated.

I mean, how do you stop yourself from,
you know...

...running a red light and then
taunting the cop till he shoots you?

Good question.

I've found that the best thing to do
is to focus on your career...

...get a hobby, become involved
in community activities...

...and at the end of the day,
if you have any energy left...

...find a quiet space...

...and yank it like a monkey
in a mango tree.

Interesting.

What kind of hobbies
are we talking about?

Well, I tried collecting stamps,
building model trains...

...but in the end,
all roads led back up the mango tree.

That's what I was afraid of.

Hey, where are you going?

I'm gonna go get in my car...

...run a red light
and hope for a clean headshot.

The great thing about this piece
is that it fuses a classical score...

...with jazz choreography.

On a counter programming note,
the Lakers are playing Miami tonight.

-Would you rather watch that?
-No, no, this is fine.

Of course, I don't have a $500 bet
down on the ballet.

-What channel?
-No, seriously, this is-- Channel 2.

Charlie, you don't have to give up
things that you like just because of me.

Oh, okay, great. Good to know.

Hey,
as long as we're on that subject...

...there's something
I wanna run past you.

-Go ahead.
-Let me just preface it by saying...

...that I am for holding off
on sex...

...so our relationship can develop more,
you know, deepness.

I'm glad. I think it's working too.

We were getting closer than we would,
had we just jumped into bed together.

Good.
Sounds like we're on the same page.

And just to make sure
we don't jump the gun...

...I was thinking it'd be a good idea...

...if I had an outlet that,
you know, took the pressure off.

-An outlet?
-Yeah, an outlet.

Something casual, meaningless.

If I work it right,
it could even be anonymous.

-You mean another woman?
-Well, that would be my first choice.

But for the purposes of this discussion,
let's stay with the term, "Outlet. "

I don't care what you call it.

You're asking for permission
to have sex with another woman.

Only because I care about you too much
to whore around without permission.

Are you crazy?

I can't go back to the mango tree,
Mia.

What?

Look, I think this is a mature,
thoughtful suggestion.

In fact, there are many cultures
that embrace the whole outlet concept...

...as a way of strengthening
and nurturing...

...the primary love relationship.

-You can't dismiss entire cultures with:
-I'm going home.

Oh, come on, we're just talking here.

I propose an idea, then we compromise.
That's the cornerstone of a relationship.

How are we gonna compromise?

Are you gonna have sex
with half a woman?

Is that an option?

What's going on?

-We had our first fight.
-Oh, what about?

I suggested
that as long as we weren't having sex...

...it'd be good for our relationship
if I had sex with somebody else.

And she didn't buy that?

Wouldn't even discuss it.

Women, huh?

They say they wanna talk,
but they don't wanna talk.

What's the matter with Uncle Charlie?

He's down because he had a fight
with his girlfriend.

-That's too bad.
-Hey, why don't you go talk to him.

-Maybe you can cheer him up.
-How?

I don't know. Tell him a joke.

Okay.

Might as well just give him
a bowl of Milky Ways.

Hey, Uncle Charlie,
what's green, has four legs...

...and would kill you
if it fell out of a tree and landed on you?

-What?
-A pool table.

It's funny because
you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree.

Nothing.

Okay, I'll talk to him.

Hey, if you can work up a fart,
ask him to pull your finger.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-Still haven't heard from Mia?
-She won't return my calls.

You do realize that suggesting
to have sex with other women...

...was a monumentally stupid thing
to do.

Yes, Alan, I realize it.

The question now,
is how do I apologize?

You mean grovel.

No, I mean apologize
with my dignity and pride intact.

Oh, you sad, naive fool.

If marriage taught me anything...

...it's that there is no apologizing
without groveling.

-Mia and I aren't married.
-Are you having sex?

Continue.

First of all, the phone's no good.

You must grovel in person.
Humiliation is a visual medium.

-Okay.
-Next, don't go empty-handed.

But keep in mind that any gifts you offer
may end up being thrown at your head.

Flowers, lingerie, jewelry, all good.

Picture frames, waffle irons,
steak knives, not so much.

You actually bought your wife
a waffle iron?

I was young.

She liked waffles.

Anyway,
the most important thing is sincerity.

-Sincerity?
-Y es.

You absolutely must be able
to fake sincerity.

You know what?
I've underestimated you.

You are far more deceitful
than I've given you credit for.

-Thank you.
-No, I was faking sincerity.

Oh, it's very good.

But all kidding aside,
I really appreciate your help.

-Well, you're welcome.
-Got you again.

That's-- That was good.

-Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?
-What's that?

Pull my finger.

-You're bluffing.
-Try me?

Wait, give me another chance.

I though I had one.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-These are for you.
-You didn't have to do that.

Really? My brother said I did.

Well, thank him for me.

Come on in.

I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

Actually, I think I owe you an apology.

-You do?
-Yeah, these are for you.

You didn't have to do that.

I shouldn't have gotten so angry
with you.

Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't
incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic--

I accept your apology.

The point is,
is that I really don't have any right...

...to object to you
sleeping with other women.

We don't have a commitment.
You're free to do whatever.

Thanks. That's great. Very mature.

-So everything's okay now?
-No, you ass.

If we keep seeing each other,
I want a commitment.

-Commitment?
-Yes, a commitment.

Does that mean we can have sex?

Is that the only reason
you'd be willing to make a commitment?

It's in the top two.

Well, I think sex should wait
until we get our relationship on track.

Okay, okay.
Let me make sure I understand this.

You want me to make a commitment
that I will not have sex with anyone...

...at the same time
I'm not having sex with you?

Yes.

All right,
let's come at this from another angle.

We're gonna be sexually exclusive,
but without the sex?

Well,
I suppose you could look at it that way.

So bottom line...

...no sex for Charlie...

...with you or anyone else
for the foreseeable future.

Correct.

Are you insane?

If you care about us, it should be
something that you wanna do.

What are you giving up?

-The same thing.
-You wanna sleep with other guys?

-Of course not.
-Then you're giving up nothing.

Tell you what, I'll give up sex.
You give up, I don't know, a kidney.

Come on, don't be stupid.

-Okay, okay, dancing.
-Dancing's my life, Charlie.

Now we have a level playing field.

You know what,
maybe you should just go.

Right, why stay here when I can
just as easily not have sex with you...

...in the comfort of my home?

Oh, go to hell.

See?
That's why you didn't get a waffle iron.

Hey, how did it go with Mia?

-Great. We broke up.
-How is that great?

Now I can go back
to being who I really am.

And who's that?

Somebody who doesn't care
who he really is.

Someone who just has fun.

I see. Someone who spends his life
in a drunken haze...

...having meaningless sex
with strangers.

If you knew who I am,
why'd you ask?

Hurry, Charlie.
I'm starting to sober up.

Well, we can't have that.

No. You might find out who she is.

-Here you go.
-Good.

Boy, I haven't been this drunk
since I took my SATs.

Doesn't seem to have held you back.

No, just one year. Sixth grade.

Charlie? You okay?

Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind.

Do you wanna look at my boobs?

-No, thanks.
-Are you sure?

It always cheers me up.

Oh, Mia. Hi.

Is Charlie here?

-Tickle, tickle.
-Cut it out.

That was great, do it again.

Alan,
don't you think it's time...

...you kept your girlfriend company?

-My what?
-Thanks for playing along.

Oh, yes, my-- My girlfriend.
Yes, excuse me. Coming, pookie.

-Well, this is an awkward moment.
-You are such a schmuck.

Okay, the ice is broken.

-Goodbye, Charlie.
-Oh, come on.

We don't have a commitment.
We don't have a relationship.

You know, you're right.
Go back to your bimbo.

Hey, hey, hey. She's not a bimbo.

I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon.

No, wait, Mia.
At least tell me why you came.

You wanna know why?
I came because after I cooled down...

...I started to miss you
and I wanted to make love.

-That's great. It's wonderful.
-And it's not gonna happen.

Why? Because of that bimbo?

Let me tell you something.

The entire time I was fooling around
with her, I was thinking of you.

Oh, swell.

You know what I mean.

I would trade a hundred of her
for one of you.

You're ready to make a commitment?

Yes.

Maybe you want some time
to think about it?

How could that help?

Look, I don't wanna be
with anybody but you...

...so I might as well be committed.

Yes, you should.

-You wanna go upstairs?
-Not right now.

Oh, please don't tell me
you've got somebody in your room.

No, no, no.

No.

If we're gonna
do this commitment thing...

...the first time
should be really special.

What have you got in mind?

Well, you know. Candles, music...

...and maybe not having the girl
I was trying to rebound with...

...dancing half naked on the deck
with my idiot brother.

-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah. He's an idiot.

Call me later.

Well, back to the mango tree.

What is this?

A healthy cereal
that won't rot your teeth.

You got that right,
because I'm not eating it.

That's all you're getting.

-Morning.
-Morning.

-Morning.
-ls he in a better mood today?

Yeah.

Uncle Charlie,
I got another joke for you.

-Okay.
-There's two muffins...

...sitting side by side
in a muffin tin in the oven.

One muffin says,
"Boy, it's hot in here. "

And the other one says,
"Holy crap, a talking muffin. "

I just don't think
he knows what's funny.

.......... ********** ..........

-Good morning.
-Morning.

Charlie, right?

Well, I guess it's too late to deny it.

Would you like some coffee?

Sure...

...I would.

You have a beautiful house.

Thank you...

...so much.

My name's Sandy.

Yes, of course it is.

How could I forget?
Sandy like the beach, or the Koufax.

-Pardon me?
-You know, Sandy Koufax.

Great Dodger pitcher,
hall-of-famer.... Never mind.

So, Sandy...

...how did you sleep?

Just fine. How about you?

Great. Like a drunk baby.

Are you hungry?

Not yet. Maybe after I throw up.

What did you do last night?

I was hoping you could fill me in.

There's my little Sandy beach.

Good morning, Alley-Oop.

Oh, thank God. I was afraid
I was gonna have to quit drinking.

So, what do you think of Sandy?

Arguably the greatest southpaw
in the history of baseball.

My Sandy.

I don't know,
I've never seen her pitch.

-But she sure can cook.
-Well, guess how we met.

I suppose we can rule out
Dodger Stadium.

In cooking class.

You've been taking a class?

-Where do you think I go every Tuesday?
-You're not here on Tuesday nights?

No, I'm in cooking class.
And guess who's the teacher?

-Who?
-Sandy.

Who's Sandy?

That's Sandy.

Great story.

-Alan is my star pupil.
-And you are my star teacher.

So cute.

Yo.

-Can I have some more bacon?
-Oh, in a jiff.

My mother always said,
"A well-fed man is a happy man. "

Our mother always said, "Here's
1 0 bucks for pizza, don't wait up. "

Oh, that reminds me, she called
and invited us for Christmas.

-You told her yes, right?
-Absolutely.

You and I were going
to spend Christmas together.

We are.

-But you're going to your mother's.
-What gave you that idea?

You see, Sandy,
it's kind of a family tradition.

Our mother invites us even though
she doesn't want us to come.

We say yes
even though we don't wanna go.

When we don't show,
though she's relieved...

...she gets to complain
about what horrible children she has.

It's the perfect gift.

Christmas is supposed to be about
spending time with your loved ones.

Yeah, going to our mother's
would cut into that.

Alan gets to spend it with his son and l
get to play Stuff the Stocking in Vegas...

...with a couple
of saline-enhanced elves.

Does this mean
that I'm finally going to meet your son?

I guess it does.

Gosh, I so hope he likes me.

The way you cook...

...the only problem is gonna be
keeping him from humping your leg.

That's the sheets.

If you fold them while they're warm,
they don't wrinkle.

Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry.

Marriage, boredom, alimony, death.

You are such a cynic.

-And you are such a sap.
-How am I a sap?

-Are you blind? She's a nester.
-What's that supposed to mean?

She throws you some tail,
a couple of pieces of bacon...

...and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
got a roommate.

"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?
Isn't that from Cinderella?

You don't think
that bitch was a nester?

Anyway, I find that a couple of drops
of lemon juice on the dryer sheet...

...really freshens up the whole load.

Really? I find that just a couple valiums
in my coffee...

...keeps me from snapping necks.

Well, hold this, please...

...I'm just going to pop these on the bed
while they're still warm and toasty.

So which one of you guys is slipping
the high hard one to Martha Stewart?

Hey, Brandi. It's Charlie Harper.

I'm coming to Vegas for Christmas...

...and was wondering if you and your
sister wanted to celebrate again.

Harper.

Oh, wait, it's possible that you
remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez.

Right.

Yeah, hola.

Anyway, I'm sitting here making
vacation plans and I'm thinking:

"Where better to commemorate the birth
of our lord than Caesar's Palace? "

Hey, Charlie. Hungry?

Hold on, Brandi.

-Not really, but listen--
-Last chance.

I'm gonna start dinner
so the kitchen's gonna be off limits.

-But it's my kitchen.
-So?

I just thought it was important
to point out.

You're so cute.

Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up
an estimate and I'll call you back.

Oh, hi, Berta.
Oh, I've got a surprise for you.

-A mini-blind brush.
-A what?

I don't think Alan's blinds
have been dusted.

Probably because
you didn't have the proper tool.

Gee, thanks.

-We gotta talk.
-I'm on it.

You better be,
or else she's gonna be on it.

Because now I have the proper tool.

-Hey, listen.
-You had your chance, Charlie.

-lf you're hungry, take a pudding cup.
-I don't want a pudding cup.

-We need to establish ground rules.
-Oh, okay, I'm listening.

Okay, well, first of all,
Berta's been with me for a long time.

And what she lacks
in housekeeping skills...

...she more than makes up for
in upper-body strength.

What's that?

-Rack of lamb.
-Really?

-You're making that for us?
-Yep.

With roasted baby potatoes
and caramelized carrots.

Anyway, anyway.

Ground rules.

I wanna be supportive
of you and Alan--

Sorry. One quick question.
Chocolate or raspberry soufflé?

-lt doesn't matter, the point is--
-I'll just make raspberry.

Actually, I prefer chocolate.

Chocolate it is.

Now, why don't I mix you up
a little cocktail...

-...and you can take a nap before dinner?
-A nap would be nice.

Can I still have the pudding cup?

Okay, but just one.

I don't want you spoiling your appetite
before dinner.

Thank you.

Go on.

-Well?
-Good news.

We're having rack of lamb.

Oh, no.

I'm hungry. Where's Sandy?

She went to get a honey-baked ham
for Christmas Eve dinner.

Honey-baked ham.

I find it a little ironic that despite your
warnings about her nesting instincts...

...you haven't missed a single one
of her meals.

Yeah, I'm a master of irony.

-I thought you were going to Vegas.
-Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

Then you'd have the whole ham
to yourself.

You should talk, Porky.

Who took the lasagna
under the deck...

...so we wouldn't see him eat it
all himself?

Who made a meatloaf sandwich
by taking a slice of meatloaf...

...and putting it between
two other slices of meatloaf?

I am cutting down on carbs.

Yeah, it's working for you.

When's the last time you looked down
in the shower and saw your testicles?

I don't need to see them.
I know they're there.

And what about you?
What do you call this?

Goodyear or Pirelli?

This, my chunky friend,
is water weight.

Water weight.

It's genetic. I retain water.

You also retain German chocolate cake,
lamb stew and Belgian waffles.

Hey, people who live in fat asses
shouldn't throw waffles.

Don't talk about my ass.

I am very self-conscious about my ass.

I'm-- I'm sorry.

I'm just lashing out
because I haven't eaten in 75 minutes.

Want some of Sandy's
homemade fudge?

Don't play with me, Alan.

-You've got fudge up here?
-Close your eyes.

Okay.

Fudge.

You know what would be great?

Honey-baked fudge.

Or...

...fudge-covered ham.

Well, I'm really happy we get
to spend Christmas together.

We don't have to go
to your mom's, do we?

Don't be silly.

Hey, you hungry?

-I could eat.
-Well, you're gonna.

Can we order Chinese
like we did last year?

No, this year we're gonna
do something a little more traditional.

Deli?

No, we're gonna have a real,
home-cooked Christmas dinner.

Whose home?

-Our home.
-How?

Well, I am dating a lady who's
gonna make us a wonderful dinner.

Oh, okay.

Are you at all curious?

Yeah, a little.

Okay, you can ask me any question
and I'll try and answer it for you.

What are we having?

No, about the lady.

No, not really.

Well, I just want you to know
that I really like her...

...and you're probably gonna
be seeing her a lot.

Do I have to like her?

-Well, of course not.
-Then I probably won't.

Why would you say that?

We're very different people, Dad.

So true.

Is she gonna be staying over?

-Yes.
-Where is she gonna sleep?

In my room.

Okay.

Just remember, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

Hey, what are you doing out here?

I thought I should prepare you.

For what?

Alan.

Remember what I told you
about nesters?

Yeah.

Well, some are hummingbirds,
some are robins.

But you, my friend...

...you've got yourself a partridge
in a freaking pear tree.

-Sandy did all this?
-Yep.

I think it's cool.
It's like an amusement park.

Yeah, Six Flags
Over Crazy-Ass-Chick Land.

This cannot be Jake.

You're too grown-up-looking.

Yeah, thanks.
Are those for anybody?

Help yourselves.

Gingerbread.

Jake, you can help me
in the kitchen.

I'm making chocolate éclairs
and I need an official taster.

I like her.

Will you look at that?
They're bonding already.

Alan, your kid would join the T aliban
if they made their own s'mores.

-So when did she do all this decorating?
-Hard to say.

-Everything was normal until lunchtime.
-Oh, I missed lunch.

What did you have?

She made me a bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich...

...with garlic mayonnaise
on sourdough toast.

Oh, damn.

Anyway, after lunch I took
a little nap...

...and woke up
in Santa's Village of the Damned.

Why do you have to be so cynical?

There is nothing wrong with decorating
your home to show a little holiday spirit.

But it's not her home, is it?

Well, no.

-Whose home is it, Alan?
-Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her.

-Hold it.
-What?

After dinner, you nimrod.

Anybody have room for another éclair?

Not unless I unbutton my pants.

Mine are already unbuttoned.

I took mine off when she brought out
the marshmallow yams.

Okay, then. What do you say
we all go into the living room...

...and sing some Christmas carols?

-You mean stand up?
-I don't think I can.

I'm not wearing pants.

Come on, you guys,
what's Christmas without caroling?

Hanukkah?

Sandy? Something wrong?

Who moved the reindeer?

I don't know that one, but I'll wing it.

Who moved the reindeer?
The savior's come

He 's coming to check on the rein--

No, no, no.

-These reindeer.
-What about them?

Donner and Blitzen are out of order.

-Somebody's been playing with them.
-So?

So I wanna know who it was.

-Jake?
-I didn't do it.

Charlie?

Oh, all right, I may have used one
of them as a swizzle stick.

Well, no harm done.

If you must play with them,
please remember...

...it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

Okay.

Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen,
Donner, Blitzen.

-Got it.
-Say it.

Donner, Blitzen.

Okay, then.

"The Little Drummer Boy. "

Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen.

Alan. Why aren't you asleep?

I don't know.

Just excited about Christmas, I guess.

Well, Santa won't come
while you're awake.

Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that.

Now close your eyes
and let visions of sugarplums...

...dance through your wee little head.

Okay.

-Oh, no.
-What?

I forgot to put out cookies
and milk for Santa.

You're kidding, right?

Do you want coal in your stocking?

That's what you're gonna get if Santa
doesn't find a snack when he comes.

I see.

So you believe in the vengeful,
Old Testament Santa.

Are you mocking Christmas?

No, no, no. You know what?

I'll take care of the milk and cookies.
You just relax and go to sleep.

He sees us when we're sleeping,
you know?

Right.

I don't make the rules.

Okay.

Oh, God, oh, God

Oh, God, oh, God

-Charlie?
-Hang on.

Okay, I'm ready for more pie.

We have a serious problem here.

We're out of pie?

Will you listen?
There's something wrong with Sandy.

Well, didn't we know that
when she agreed to sleep with you?

No, no, even wronger than that.
She actually believes in Santa Claus.

-Really?
-Yeah.

But we still have pie?

-Yes, we still have pie.
-Then what are we doing up here?

I guess I could have a little sliver.

You know what?

I think something's wrong with Sandy.

I just said that.
Do you ever listen to me?

Sandy, sweetheart?

-You okay?
-He's not coming.

Who's not coming? Listen to this.

Santa.

Every year,
I try to make things perfect.

And every year I fail.

Mama was right.

I am a naughty girl.

Come on, Alan.

Where are we going?

I want you to teach this naughty girl
a lesson.

She needs to be punished.

You lucky dog.

What? I'm not going in there.
She's nuts.

Yeah, so?
Sex with crazy chicks is great.

Make sure you pick positions where
you can see what her hands are doing.

No. No, that would be
taking advantage...

...of a mentally unbalanced person.

Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed.

You might as well hop on board
for a farewell cruise.

I don't think so.
It just wouldn't be right.

Come on, Alan, I'm ready.

Good night.

Okay, pie for everybody.

-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

Are you out of your mind?

You've been nagging us for years
to spend Christmas with you.

Only because I knew
you'd never show up.

Well, we had to get out of the house.

Y eah, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on.
We'll exchange gifts later.

Come on in.

Dear God, look at the size of your ass.

.......... ********** ..........

I just wanna be clear
that I am here as a last resort.

I understand.

I don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry
as a science.

I think some of the drugs you're pushing
are interesting.

And I'm all for messing around
with brain chemistry.

I mean, that's how
I got through high school.

But in my experience, popping pills
doesn't relieve social anxiety...

...quite as well as, say,
bourbon and Marvin Gaye.

No, I get it. You're desperate,
and I'm full of hooey.

So in the words of Marvin Gaye,
what's going on?

-Everything I say is confidential, right?
-Whatever you say stays in this room.

Kind of like Vegas.

Well, except there's no way
you're leaving here...

...with more money
than when you came in.

Yeah, like Vegas.

Anyway, last night I'm out
with my stupid, lame-ass brother.

Sounds like
you've got some anger towards him.

Oh, you're good.

This is nice.
You and me, spending time together.

-Why don't we do this more often?
-I don't have an answer.

Well, me neither.
So how long till the movie starts?

About 20 minutes.

Y eah, sure, 20 minutes
not counting previews and ads...

...the popcorn and the giant pretzel
holding hands...

...the big soda drinking the little soda,
which, frankly, is cannibalism...

...and the reminder
to turn off your cell phones and shut up.

But nobody does, because good manners
are just the latest casualty...

...in the ongoing collapse
of Western civilization.

I now have an answer.

-I miss Jake.
-How can you miss him?

We just dropped him off
at his friend's house.

By the way, if you get tired
of those magazines under your bed...

...the kid's mom looked fairly doable.

Forget the mom. Did you see how happy
Jake was spending the weekend away?

Why would you think that?

Just because he jumped out of the car
while it was moving?

Alan, he was happy to see his friends.
Being away from you is just gravy.

I know, I know. It's natural
for him to want to spend more time...

...with his peers than his parents.

But all the same, it's sad.

Yeah, sunrise, sunset.

One day you're holding a baby
in your arms...

...and the next day he's off
hawking loogies and lighting farts...

...with a bunch of
Ritalin-addled sixth graders.

Why do I bother
to share my feelings with you?

I don't know.
It's not like I encourage it.

Oh, come on, so your kid
doesn't need you like he used to.

That's a good thing.

You can spend your weekends
enjoying yourself.

That's true. I mean, there are things
I wanna do that I haven't had time for.

Like that kid's mom.

No, no, I mean like-- Like reading.

Finally cracking open the classics.

Alan, if you wanna crack something
open, I recommend that kid's mom.

No, no, I'm serious.

You know, for years
I have been wishing that I had time...

...to read all the great books.

You know, Dostoyevsky
and Hemingway...

...Faulkner and Dickens
and Shakespeare.

And history, history.

U.S.-- U.S. history, world history,
the history of language.

I mean, why doesn't anyone
speak Sumerian anymore?

I don't know,
because I haven't read the book.

And, oh, poetry, poetry.
Byron and Keats and Shelley.

And biographies.

Julius Caesar and Abraham Lincoln
and, oh, Groucho Marx.

I mean-- I mean, look at them all.
Look at them, they're mocking me.

I haven't read any of them.

Okay, well, just pick one for now.

Why bother? There's not enough time.

There's too many books,
and there's not enough time.

Maybe you just need a system.
Put a book next to the toilet.

Every couple of days,
knock out a couple chapters.

No, no, it's too late for me.

There's not enough
bowel movements left.

-Maybe you need to change your diet.
-No, it's hopeless.

Jake will be grown up soon
and I'll be dead.

And you know
what I'll have left behind?

A life of unfulfilled dreams,
a shelf of unread books...

...and three unopened seasons
of Six Feet Under on DVD.

So, what are you doing tonight?

All right.

So your brother had a panic attack
in the middle of a bookstore.

How'd that make you feel?

What the hell do my feelings
have to do with anything?

Why don't you just humor me?

Well, I felt a little ashamed.

Because you felt
that his behavior reflected on you?

No, because I left him there.

You left him?

Not permanently.
I came back and got him...

...after he was all cried out
and it was time for the movie.

So you still went to the movie?

Yeah, I bought the tickets online.
They don't refund those.

Red Vine?

No, thank you. I am so sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

Who among us hasn't collapsed,
weeping, in the middle of a bookstore...

...for no apparent reason?

You know, I think
maybe I'd be better off at home.

So I'm supposed to miss the movie...

...just because
you had a nervous breakdown?

Well, kind of.

Don't you think
that's a little selfish, Alan?

It's just, all of a sudden I felt crushed
by this unbelievable sense of grief...

...Iike my entire life has been an exercise
in pathetic futility.

Well, I wouldn't rule it out.

Come on, bunky, cheer up.
Have a Red Vine.

I don't want a Red Vine.

-Sno-Cap?
-No.

-Raisinet?
-No.

-Goobers?
-How much crap did you buy?

They couldn't change a hundred.

All right, I'll have a Junior Mint.

I didn't get Junior Mints.

Of course not. Story of my life.

No Junior Mints for Alan.
Just Goobers.

Goobers, Goobers, Goobers.

-Dude, dude, you need to be quiet.
-Why? Why?

The First Amendment gives me
the right to yell in a crowded theater.

Goobers!

Hey, look, movie quiz.

-Let's play the movie quiz.
-I don't wanna play the movie quiz.

-lt'll be fun. I'll bet you're good at it.
-All right.

"Debra Winger and Richard Gere
starred in An Officer and a blank. "

-Oh, please.
-You need a hint?

-There's a hint in the corner.
-No, I don't need a hint.

I know the answer.
Everybody here knows the answer.

Everybody on the planet
knows the answer.

-We're not stupid.
-Chill, chill.

Oh, wait.
Oh, here's another brainteaser.

"Steven Spielberg
directed this modern retelling...

...of the H.G. Wells classic
War of the blank. "

-Couch. War of the Couch.
-Stop it.

Oh, wait, no, no, I got it.
War of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

You know what? Maybe you' re right.
Maybe we should go.

Oh, wait, no, I know this one.

"Johnny Depp cruised to success
in this comedy-action film...

...inspired by a Disneyland attraction. "

Pirates of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

He's-- He's behind on his reading.

Oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland
in that immortal classic...

... The Wizard of Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass.

That sounds like quite an episode.
Is your brother seeing a therapist?

How would I know?

He's your brother. He lives with you.

So?

All right, go ahead.

Just because I took him in,
doesn't mean I listen to him.

I understand.

He just whines about the same crap
over and over.

-Okay.
-It's not even interesting crap.

It's the crap
that bores the crap out of crap.

I got it. It's crap. Go ahead.

Thank you.
So we're driving home, and....

This seat is very comfortable.

Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable,
lumbar support. It's....

I wish I'd have spent a few extra bucks
and gotten the ejection package.

-I said I was sorry.
-They don't refund those tickets, Alan.

-I wanna go see Jake.
-Why? He's at a sleepover.

I've just got this feeling
that he needs me.

You mean
like some sort of telepathic thing?

-Exactly.
-I see.

-Did you know I was gonna do that?
-No.

Then I wouldn't trust
your psychic powers.

Oh, come on.
We can just stop by for a few minutes.

We have time now,
since we decided to skip the movie.

Oh, we decided that, did we? That's
the way it went down for you, huh?

That's how
you interpret recent events?

Settle down.
You're acting like a crazy person.

Me? I'm acting like a crazy person?
Are you freaking kidding me?

Listen to yourself.
You're getting a little scary right now.

Okay, fine. You wanna see the kid,
we'll go see the kid.

Thank you.

Was that so hard?

Charlie? The road.

Please?

You know, when you have kids...

...you find there's a deep,
spiritual connection.

You feel an actual tug
when your child needs you.

Interesting. What do you feel
when your brother hates you?

Alan. Is everything okay?

Oh, yeah, fine.
I just need to see Jake for a minute.

-He's feeling a tug.
-A tug?

Or it could be gas. We're not sure.

Well, could you just call Jake?

Jake, your father's here!
Put that down, Timmy!

-What?
-I just wanted to see if you were okay.

Oh, great, now I'm dead.
Thanks a lot.

It doesn't count.
I was talking to my stupid dad.

Well, it-- It seems like
you've got everything under control here.

Actually, I ran out of ice cream.

Do you think you could keep an eye
on the kids for a few minutes?

-Well--
-Thanks a million. I'll be right back.

She ain't coming back.

Three hours she was gone.

And when she finally came back,
she was reeking of Old Spice and pot.

-I see.
-And she didn't even have any ice cream.

All right, let's stop here for a minute...

...and talk in general
about your feelings towards women.

No, thanks.

-Rather discuss your childhood?
-Nope.

-Father? Mother?
-Dead. Killed him.

-Would you like to discuss that?
-We just did.

Charlie, I'm not sure
we're on the same page here.

Have you ever been in therapy before?

-Does massage therapy count?
-No.

It's almost the same thing.
One-on-one with a strange woman...

...who charges you for the hour
and then only gives you 50 minutes?

Why don't we just go back
to your story?

Touch a nerve there, did l?

Okay, okay.

Well, Jake ignored his father
the entire time we were there, so...

...Alan was a little upset
when we got back in the car.

He hates me. My only son hates me.

He doesn't hate you. He just
didn't appreciate you telling his friends...

...that laser tag
can induce epileptic fits.

-Well, it can.
-Be that as it may...

...you could've gotten your point across
without flopping on the floor...

...rolling your eyes up,
and pretending to swallow your tongue.

Hey, hey.
A picture is worth a thous--

Charlie, stop the car.

-Why?
-I have to get out.

-I'm feeling claustrophobic.
-There's no place to stop.

-We have to stop!
-Where?

I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
I have to get out.

-I have to get out now. Now, now, now.
-Okay, okay, hold on. Hold on.

The seat belt won't come off.

-Just push the button.
-I can't, I can't.

-lt won't come off. Help me.
-Okay, okay, move your hands.

Okay.

It's passing. It's-- Yes. I'm okay.

-No, you're not.
-What?

-Get out.
-What?

Get out now. Now, now, now.
Get out. Get out.

That's better.

So you just left your brother
on the side of the road?

He couldn't believe it either.

You should've seen his face
in the rear-view mirror.

All right, Charlie, we've been talking
for quite a while, and I gotta tell you:

I still don't understand
why you came to see me.

You in a hurry?

Doesn't that undermine your whole
pay-by-the-hour business model?

-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

So as I was driving away,
I decided I needed a little quiet time...

...for, you know,
reflection and meditation.

-Hey.
-Hey. What took you so long?

I was sure you'd come back.

I guess that's case closed
on the telepathy stuff.

-What are you drinking?
-I don't know, something soothing.

-Kahlua and cream.
-He's kidding. Give him a beer.

-Must you always embarrass me?
-Hey, I have had a traumatic night.

I feel very exposed, vulnerable,
confused--

Y eah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-Yeah, hi.
-Can we buy you ladies a drink?

-No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed.
-Boy, are we blitzed.

Perfect.

I'm Charlie. This is Alan.

-Amy.
-Beth.

Nice to meet you.
How's it going tonight?

-Pretty good.
-We're blitzed.

-How about you?
-Yeah, how you doing?

-Oh, boy. Where to start?
-No one's talking to you.

-What's the matter, Alan?
-Yeah, what's the matter?

Well, you really wanna know?

They don't. Trust me, you really don't.

Well, maybe it's a late reaction
to the divorce.

Maybe it's my son not needing me
so much now that he's growing up...

...but I think it's more than that.

I think it's just life grinding me down,
and I just....

I don't think I can take it anymore.

-Oh, you poor baby.
-Poor, poor baby.

-Tell us all about it.
-Yeah, tell us.

Well, I was never a happy child.

Oh, God, I was a miserable kid.

And the only thing
that gave my life meaning was my son.

At least you've got a son.

I've got nothing, except...

...epilepsy.

-Oh, no.
-Yeah, oh, no.

So anyway,
there I was on my wedding day...

...in front of the priest
and all our friends...

...flopping around on the altar
like an epileptic trout...

...when I heard her father say:

"You can't marry this man.
He's damaged goods. "

-Oh, gee.
-Yeah, oh, gee.

That's when I realized
that all the money in the world--

And I do have a lot.

--can't replace that special tug
you feel...

...when someone loves you
unconditionally.

-Look, Beth, the ocean.
-Oh, the ocean.

-Let's go skinny-dipping.
-Yeah.

-You wanna come?
-Yeah, come with us.

I'd love to, but I'm too sad
and I might swallow my tongue.

You two go. Swim, splash, frolic.
Enjoy your healthy bodies.

-Okay.
-Bye.

Have you no shame?

Let me think. Nope, just a tug.

And that's another thing.
My angst is real.

I don't appreciate you taking my tug
to get in someone's pants.

News flash, Alan.
They're already out of their pants.

And they're gonna come back cold, wet
and in desperate need of body heat.

For those of us with normal skin
temperature, it'll be a seller's market.

-You're unbelievable.
-No, I just think ahead.

They're gonna last two seconds
in that water. We have to hurry.

I'll get the wine.
You light some candles.

I'm sorry, I'm really not in the mood.

Are you saying that I have to
get you liquored up so I can get laid?

All right, I'll go along,
but only as a favor to you.

Thank you.

I'm gonna have to apply the condom...

...and get a rope and pulley
to lower one of those broads onto him.

Since you're making me do this,
I get Amy.

The hell you do. Which one's Amy?

Amy's the one
who overcame the eating disorder.

-Starving herself or throwing up?
-Does it make a difference?

-Does if you're paying for dinner.
-Amy is the brunette.

-Got it. So I have Jennifer.
-You mean Beth.

-Oh, right, right, B for "blonde. "
-B can also be for "brunette. "

But Amy's the brunette.
So you could do A for "anorexic. "

Unless it's B for "bulimic. "

Good point.
We're gonna need a new system.

Do you smell something?

Yeah, what is that?

I think you do these things
just to piss me off.

-Oh, my God, what happened?
-Well, while I was trying to put it out...

...my brother
stupidly called the fire department.

Why was that stupid?

Have you seen
a Malibu fireman recently?

They're all young, buff surfer dudes
whipping their big hoses around.

Amy and Beth jumped on their
hook and ladder like a couple Dalmatians.

We never saw them again.

Yes, the Malibu Fire Department.

I have several patients who compulsively
masturbate to their calendar.

-No kidding.
-Both sexes.

So, Charlie, I'm still not clear...

...on what it is
you would like me to help you with.

Your anger issues?
Your sexual issues? Drinking?

No, no, no, that's all cool.

Then tell me, why are you here?

Okay, well, I'm here
to lay some groundwork for the future.

Some groundwork?

Yeah. I've come to realize
that there's a very good chance...

...that I might someday snap
and kill my brother.

And I figure if I'm
already under a psychiatrist's care...

...then I can always
cop an insanity plea.

You're thinking of killing your brother?

Doctor-patient confidentiality.

Where's the bottle opener?

Check in the drawer
by the coffee machine.

Hey, what do you think of this
for the new drapes?

T oo small.

You know, I think it's kind of cheerful.
I'll put it in the "maybe" pile.

You do that.

You know, we're also
gonna have to reupholster the couch.

-You think?
-There's a lot of water damage.

Which, frankly, I think was the result
of the firemen showing off for the girls.

You could be right.

You know, I just wanna tell you...

...I really appreciate you sticking by me
in the past couple of days...

...you know,
pulling me out of my funk.

You really are a great brother.

-I don't know what I'd do without you.
-I don't know what I'd do without you.

But golly, it's sure fun to think about.

.......... ********** ..........

This is such a beautiful sunset.

Thanks.

Thanks? You're taking credit
for the sunset?

No, not-- Not the sunset per se.

But I did buy a house on the beach...

...so we can stand here
and watch the sunset...

...so thanks.

Your house works with
a lot of women, doesn't it?

Honestly, it's like a G-spot
with two mortgages.

Just so you know, I'm not with you
for your house or your money.

So it's the car.

Why would I care about your car?

It's an $80,000 Mercedes.

Yeah, so? What does it do
that other cars don't do?

It costs $80,000.

Hey, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

Charlie, you don't have
to buy me expensive jewelry.

Okay, nothing but cheap crap
from now on.

It's beautiful.

Read the inscription.

"One month, two weeks, four days. "
What does it mean?

Well, since we decided to go ahead and
consummate our relationship finally...

...I thought I should honor the time
we've already spent together.

Exclusively.
In a committed relationship.

Without any sex whatsoever.

So unless we have sex
before midnight...

...you're gonna need to buy
a new bracelet?

You're pretty sure of yourself.

Well, since you went to all the trouble
to engrave it....

Don't even ask what I used
as a chisel.

-Kandi.
-Hello, Alan.

Is Charlie available?
Because I wish to speak with him.

Okay, why don't you just wait here...

...and I'll let him know.

I would be immensely appreciative
if you would.

Alrighty.

What the hell does...this mean?

-I was sending you a message.
-What?

That you're a woman trapped
in a man's body?

-Kandi's here.
-And you want me to call you Kandi?

No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing
before Mia.

She's been calling here for days.

It's time you let her know
you're with another woman.

Yeah, Charlie, after all it's been
"one month, two weeks, four days. "

Did you know that Alan's
a woman trapped in a man's body?

So you gonna go talk
to your ex-girlfriend?

Okay, first of all, sweetheart...

...she's not really an ex-girlfriend.

Her name's Kandi.

Thanks, Alan.

With a K.

-Alan.
-And an l.

So if Kandi with a K and an l
isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she?

Well, l-- l-- I would say
she's more of a person...

...who would drop by
from time to time and--

Yeah, that.

Why haven't you told this person
that you're in a relationship?

Her name's Kandi.

Boy, you're on thin ice.

I think we both know
why you didn't tell her.

Well, if that's the case,
then this discussion is moot.

We should go upstairs
while Alan goes back...

...and lies about my whereabouts.

Well, I'm not half the liar you are,
but I'll give it a shot.

Shall we go upstairs
and continue this conversation?

Are you out of your freaking mind?

Okay, you're mad, I get that.

-So?
-Well, Kandi, it's like this.

Charlie's with another woman.

Don't lie to me, Alan.

Okay.

He's in Africa...

...working as a scrub nurse
for Doctors Without Borders.

Story of my life.

That's the story of your life?

It's not always a scrub nurse...

...but it's always Africa.

Before you say anything,
I want you to know...

...I've anticipated problems like this.
Look on the other side of the bracelet.

"I'm very, very sorry. "

Problem is, Charlie, that you don't
believe in this relationship.

Not believe in it?

It's kept me from having sex
for over six weeks.

It would be like not believing
in a serious groin pull.

-You know what Kandi is?
-I try not to judge.

She's a lifeboat. You're keeping
a lifeboat for when this ship sinks.

Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats
don't mean you expect...

...the ship to sink.
The relationship, if I may.

What they mean is that you have
a healthy respect...

...for the power of the sea.

Are you listening to yourself?

Y eah, I just caught the last part.
Not well thought out. No.

All my life guys have looked at me
like I'm just some kind of sex toy.

Well, they're wrong.

Yeah, just because you're good
at something...

...doesn't mean you
should be pigeonholed.

And the only reason
I'm so good at it...

...is because I practice.

Of course,
all the practice in the world...

...isn't gonna help if you don't
love what you're doing.

What do you want me to do, Mia?

Call every woman I've known...

...to announce I'm now
in a relationship?

Hi, Shirley, this is Charlie Harper.

We met at Disneyland
about 22 years ago.

Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
That was me.

Anyway, I thought you should know
I have a girlfriend now.

So I'd appreciate it if you
didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye.

Well, that takes care of Shirley.
Now, what about Kandi?

You want me to tell her?
Fine. I'll tell her.

I'll go tell her right now.

But before I cut
her loose completely...

...Iet me float a crazy idea by you.

Sort of a win, win, win.

Are you out of your freaking mind?

It was worth a shot.

Kandi, before you say anything,
I want you to know...

...I'm in a committed relationship now
and I'm really in love with this woman.

She's the best thing
that's happened to me...

...and I can't imagine
being with anyone else.

Now, sweetheart.

Don't cry.
I'm sure you'll find someone else.

-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

What?
I thought we were going upstairs.

Okay, you're still mad. I get that.

-I made your bed.
-Thank you.

It's been real easy lately.

How nice for you.

You haven't even been flying solo,
have you?

That's a little personal.

Hey, you want privacy,
wash your own sheets.

Once I get my mitts on them,
they're in the public domain.

-Good morning.
-Morning.

-How did it go with Mia last night?
-Based on his laundry, not well.

-Why don't you tell the neighbors?
-Where do you think I'm going?

By the way,
thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me.

Hey, I'm your brother.
I got your back.

Good to know.

Hey, as long as we're on the subject,
I was wondering.

Since you're swimming in
Lake Monogamy, as it were...

...would you mind if l, you know...

-...asked Kandi out sometime?
-Go for it.

-Just wanted to make sure you're okay.
-I'm fine.

-Don't want you to feel weird.
-Thanks for your consideration.

Morning, Huggy Bear.

So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?

Okay, I want you to know
I tracked down Kandi.

I told her to move on and she has.

So I got no lifeboats,
no life preservers, no water wings.

If the ship goes down,
I'm going down with it.

So there's no longer any reason to
put off you and me getting naked.

Charlie, I'd like you
to meet my parents.

Hello.

What if Dad says I could stay up
to watch it?

He won't.

How do you know?

Your father and I talk, so don't
try to play us against each other.

I gotta try, it's what I do.

Hi.

Hello. Is Alan here?

Father Huggy Bear.

Yes, my child?

-You've got company.
-Alan?

-Stall them, stall them, stall them.
-Okay.

You must be Jake.

And you must be Jake's grandma.

Judith, hi.

Go watch some cartoons.

-Okay.
-Cool.

-Are you proud of yourself?
-What do you mean?

Oh, please,
she has to be half your age.

Oh, that.

Yeah, I am pretty proud of that.

What could you possibly
have in common?

-What do you talk about?
-Talk?

T o tell you the truth, we haven't
really done a lot of talking.

I mean, I did hear her confession.

She's been a very bad girl.

I'm supposed to leave Jake here?

What kind of message does
that send him?

I don't know.
Dreams can come true.

Life is beautiful. There is a God.

Hey, Judith. Father.

I suppose you're the one that
introduced Alan to that slutty little--

Don't say it, Judith.
You'll just be demeaning all women.

And yes.

Figures. Well, I don't want
her around my son.

Oh, really? So do I get to screen
the men that you're dating?

Let's not forget about the guy
who delivered the truckload of sod.

-What about him?
-lt doesn't take two months...

...to put down a new lawn, Judith.

Sounds like she got laid
before the sod did.

I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

Watch out for crab grass.

So, what's Kandi, a nun?

Catholic school girl.

Oh, excellent choice.

Oh, hey, how--?
How are things with Mia?

Not bad. She forgives me.
Introduced me to her parents.

Oh, yeah? How did that go?

Well, you know,
those things are always awkward.

The big news is I'm taking Mia
to the Bel Air Hotel tonight...

...where we will express our love
in the way that we were meant to.

-Drunk and in a hurry?
-You got it.

-How's the caviar?
-It's perfect.

Everything's perfect.

-Would you like a fire?
-Don't go to any trouble.

It's no trouble.

Luckily I was a Boy Scout
in Beverly Hills.

-Champagne?
-No, thanks.

I wanna be completely present
for the first time we make love.

Good for you.

Don't you want to be present?

Well, within reason.

Come on.

What do you say
we save the champagne?

But I already opened it.

Do you need alcohol
to make love to me?

No, no.

I don't need it.

Well, then.

Is something wrong?

I don't know.

I mean, we didn't hop into bed
on the first date.

We've gotten to know each other.
We're not drinking.

It's all so new to me.

That's what makes it special.

I just don't want either of us
to be disappointed...

...because one of us might not be...

...throwing their A-game tonight.

-Are you nervous?
-No, no. Of course not.

But, you know, of the two of us,
only one can fake an A-game.

There's nothing that you could do
to disappoint me tonight.

No, no, it's what I can't do
that might disappoint you.

You just relax. I'll be right back.

Okay.

Why don't you put some music on?

Okay.

-Should I ask?
-I wish you wouldn't.

I'm not supposed to play this
because my mom says it's too violent.

It has to be violent.

You can't negotiate with zombies.

-Don't tell me, tell her.
-I don't think she likes me.

She doesn't really like anybody.

Except the guy who keeps
putting grass in our backyard.

Okay, time for bed.

-Just a little longer.
-I'm not sleepy.

No, him.

I get to stay up.

-That's not fair.
-Jake.

Just because she's a girl.

-Wanna play?
-Oh, no, thanks.

I-- I thought maybe we could just talk.

Hang on. Let me just saw off
this zombie's head.

Good Lord.

There we go.

Now, let me save my work.

Okay, all done.

Wanna have sex?

Actually, I do.

But maybe we could spend a little time
getting to know each other first.

All right.

What do you wanna know?

Well, do you have
any brothers or sisters?

I do not. How about you?

Well, Charlie.

Oh, right, Charlie.

-Do you like to read?
-Oh, yeah, I love reading.

Oh, great, great, me too.
Read anything good lately?

You mean like books and magazines...

...not billboards
and text messages, right?

-Yeah.
-Then, no.

Do menus count?

Are you ready for me?

Mia, if I were any more ready,
I'd be done.

Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. You okay?

-I think so.
-Are you sure?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Are you okay?

-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

But I think that's enough foreplay.

You see, the thing for me was
that I never should have gotten married.

I was young,
I didn't know who I was.

And to be completely honest,
I was just afraid of being alone.

Can I share something with you?

Y es, please. This is communicating,
this is how we connect.

You shouldn't tell people that stuff,
it makes you sound like a loser.

No, it makes me sound like
a real human being.

A person with feelings and flaws.

Loser.

-Why don't we just go have sex?
-Finally.

Oh, cheer up.

It wasn't that bad.

There were parts of it that I liked.

Can we please not go over
the game film now?

-What's the big deal?
-What's the big deal?

This is supposed to be the part
that I'm good at.

You are.

It was fine.

I don't wanna hear fine.

I wanna see the top of
your head blow off.

It's not a carnival game.

The object is not to swing
your mallet and ring my bell.

Well, we disagree.

That's just your ego talking.

Charlie, listen to me.

I love you, not your money or car
or your house or your skills in bed.

What's left?

-Charlie.
-Oh, come on. Come on.

You're saying that if I was some
pencil-weenie guy living in a shack...

...and taking the bus to my job selling
oranges on the freeway off-ramp...

-...you'd still love me?
-Yes, I would still love you.

-Okay, I understand now.
-Good.

You're insane.

Why? Because I love the real you?

No, no, because you think
there is a real me.

Would you believe I love you
if my eyes had rolled back...

...and my head had blown off?

It would be a start.

All right. I guess we're just
gonna have to try again.

Hang on. Hang on.

How am I gonna know
you're not faking it?

If I was gonna fake it, don't you think
I would have done it the first time?

Fair enough.

-Hey, wanna hear something amusing?
-Always.

According to my girlfriend...

...underneath all the superficial,
cool stuff in my life...

...there's actually a real me.

-No kidding?
-Apparently, he's quite a guy.

I'd like to meet him sometime.

Don't hold your breath.

My girlfriend, on the other hand,
has no idea who I really am...

...damn little desire to find out...

...and is only interested in
riding me like a mustang...

...and draining me of all bodily fluids.

How do you feel about that?

I think I love her.

You know what...

...Iove isn't blind, it's retarded.

.......... ********** ..........

You know
what I've been thinking about?

-What?
-The death penalty.

Really? That's a--
That's a very complex issue.

So-- So, what are your thoughts?

If you're going to the chair
they give you what you want...

...for your last meal.

I guess.

-I'm gonna order cereal.
-Why?

Because if you keep adding milk
you can make it last forever.

And they just gotta wait.

Okay, let's go back a bit.

Why would you be going to the chair
in the first place?

I don't know.
My DNA shows up at a murder scene...

...because it's planted by a crooked cop
or maybe one of my teachers.

-So you'd be wrongly accused?
-Story of my life, Dad.

Remember that water pistol incident
at school?

But that was your water pistol.

Yes, but it wasn't my pee.

Morning.

Oh, hey, how was your run?

Great. We made it
all the way to the pier and back.

Didn't we, honey?

Yeah.

Pier. Back.

Hey, Jake,
you ever seen anybody cough up blood?

-Nope.
-Then pay attention.

-Ass.
-Ass?

Kiss.

My.

Sweaty.

I think I'll jump in the shower.
Wanna join me?

Can't.

Later.

Maybe.

All right. Well,
you drink your health shake, all right?

-You'll feel better.
-Doubt it.

-What's in that?
-I don't know.

Vitamins, minerals, protein.

Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff
I ate in high school.

Hey, do you think they let you
have a last poop after your last meal?

What?

Because as long as you're sitting on
the can...

...technically you're still pooping.

And they gotta wait.

Go get dressed.

If they made you hold one in,
that'd be cruel and unusual punishment.

You know, I am impressed
with what you're doing here.

Exercising, eating right,
laying off the cigars and the booze.

I mean,
Mia has really done wonders with you.

-Y eah, she's an incredible woman.
-She is.

-And I'm a lucky guy.
-You are.

Why is there
this little voice in my head...

...that keeps whispering,
"Kill yourself. Do it now. "

Don't worry about that. It's common.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

Every man who gets into a long-term,
committed relationship hears that voice.

Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin.

I don't know why.

Maybe because I enjoyed him
in that submarine movie.

-What was that call--?
-Would you get to the point?

You have to remember that over time
that voice will fade...

...when you realize
what you're giving up...

...is nothing compared
to what you're gaining.

What exactly am I gaining?

Are you kidding?
You're gaining a soul mate.

Someone to walk down life's path
with you.

Someone who'll always be there,
sharing your hopes...

...your joys and your sorrows.

You got nothing.

That's what the minister said
at my wedding.

Hunt for Red October.

Be back in a while, honey.
I'm going for a power walk.

-Pace yourself.
-Don't worry.

This is a good pace.

Hey.

What you doing?

Nothing. Close the damn door.

You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke
or drink anymore.

You told your father you weren't gonna
watch dirty movies on cable anymore.

Don't change the subject.

Mia's gonna be really pissed at you.

Only if she finds out
and she doesn't have to find out.

Well, I guess that depends.

What, are you blackmailing me?

No. I'm just saying
if you don't give me 20 bucks...

...I'm gonna tell on you.

That's blackmail.

Well, then, yeah.

-Oh, hi, Mom, how are you?
-Deeply hurt.

Is this about me or Charlie?

-Charlie.
-Great. Come on in.

Can you explain to me how your brother
can be in a serious relationship...

...and not only
have I not met the woman...

...he hasn't even bothered
to tell me her name?

Do you really need an explanation
for that?

Do you want it to be about you?

-Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen.
-Thank you.

Thank God I didn't know Anne Frank.

Hello.

Hello.

-I'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother.
-I'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend.

-So we finally meet.
-So we do.

One question.

-I'm listening.
-Can you fix him?

I'm trying.

Fifteen, 1 6, 1 7, 1 8--

Jake?

How about a hug
for your grandmommy?

No, thank you.

One, two--

What the hell are you doing?

Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down.
Keep it down.

Mia thinks I'm taking a power walk.

This is a sad, sad day.

I always figured
you'd be the last guy in the world...

...to end up whipped.

I am not whipped. I'm considerate.

-Considerate?
-Yeah.

See, I love Mia
and want her to be happy.

I happen to know she's not happy
when I smoke cigars...

...and drink and gamble
and stay out all night...

...and eat meat and sugar and grease
and fat and nap and swear...

...and wear shorts
and bowling shirts....

Charlie, you ain't just whipped,
you're roped, saddled and gelded.

They could use you
to give rides at kid's birthday parties.

-I am not whipped.
-Yeah.

Here, might as well take one
of these sacks since yours is empty.

Hang on a second.

-That ain't gonna do it, Alice.
-What?

You smell like a beer bottle
that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Oh, hang on,
let's see if I got anything in here...

...that might mask your stench.

Oven cleaner. No.

Ty-D-Bol. No.

How do you feel about taking a whore's
bath with a hunk of blue cheese?

I'm so proud of him. He hasn't had
a drop of alcohol in weeks.

Well, that's one way to go.

But I've found that men who drink
tend to talk less and sleep more.

Which, frankly,
becomes increasingly desirable...

...as the years go by.

Oh, this can't be good.

Hello, darling. Wonderful to see you.

Hi, Mom.

Have you been dusting?

-No, why?
-You reek of Lemon Pledge.

You're welcome.

I'll be downstairs.

No snacking, Charlie.

We're going to
the best vegetarian restaurant in town.

Oh, boy.

Oh, thank God. Meat.

-I love you, Rose.
-I love you too, Charlie.

And may I say, I would never
try to change you the way she has.

-Her name's Mia.
-I know what her name is.

I also know where she lives,
her employment history...

...and if you want I can get you
photographs of a wet T -shirt contest...

...she entered during spring break 1 995
at a college bar called Señor Frogs.

I forgot who I'm dealing with.

I know you have to hide
to smoke a cigar...

...and slam back a warm beer.

What'd you do, bug my garage?

Don't be paranoid.

I have a long-standing arrangement
with Jake.

Charlie, I'm ready.

I'm out here.

Go, go, go.

Okay, I'll go,
but I want you to remember one thing.

-What?
-I'm not gonna wait for you forever.

How do I look?

How's your couscous?

Yum, yum.

I had an interesting chat
with your mom today.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

I know she comes on a little strong
but her heart's in the right place.

If you mean in a cooler on its way to a
dying man in Tennessee, then we agree.

-You can't possibly mean that.
-I suppose not.

She's too selfish to donate an organ.

Even one she doesn't use.

That's so unfair, Charlie.
Your mother loves you.

Really? Did she or did she not say
I was a bitter disappointment?

-Well, she did, but--
-And did she...

...or did she not say that
I'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer...

...who wasted 1 3 years of piano lessons
that she paid for...

...by marrying a series of men
with large wallets and small penises?

Yes, that was mentioned.

It's natural for someone who loves you
to want to see you live to your potential.

Do you want to be known as the guy
who writes songs about adult diapers?

Hey, it's better than being known
as the guy who wears them.

Charlie, we both know
you can do so much more with your life.

Maybe.
But you gotta admire my restraint.

Oh, come on, look how much you've
accomplished since we've been together.

You're exercising regularly,
you cut way down on the drinking...

...and you're eating right.

Did you ever think you'd
change your life the way you have?

Never.

It just goes to show, you can do
anything you put your mind to.

I smell meat.

Excuse me?

Your breath. It stinks of meat.

Well, it could be my tongue.

My tongue is meat.

No, you've been eating meat.
I can smell it.

Maybe it's this breast of Tofurky
you smell.

-No, I smell beef.
-Where would I get beef?

You tell me.

Well, maybe it's secondhand beef.

-What?
-You know, like secondhand smoke.

Some thoughtless guy...

...who's sitting next to you
eating a steak can--

Oh, screw it.

I paid a slightly disturbed woman
to toss a bag of cheeseburgers...

...onto the deck
while you were getting dressed.

-Oh, Charlie.
-Don't "Oh, Charlie" me, I was starving.

And I'll tell you another thing,
my power walk...

...was two quick beers and half a Cuban
cigar while cowering in my own garage.

That's why you smelt like
Lemon Pledge.

Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out
the natural luster of my forehead.

So you've been lying to me?

If you mean telling you
I wasn't going to do a bunch of things...

...then doing them anyway and lying
about it, then I've been lying to you.

Well, I suppose I can forgive you.
If you promise it'll never happen again.

Oh, it'll never happen again.
You know why?

Because I am done
with this whole charade.

I'm tired of you trying
to make me over into something I'm not.

I'm a grown man,
not a work in progress.

-Charlie, people are staring.
-Let them stare.

You guys know what I mean.

Why can't women
look at a guy for who he is...

...instead of
who they can turn him into?

-Please, you're embarrassing me.
-Good.

Maybe now you know how I feel.

Sitting in a restaurant eating medallions
of bean curd with lawn mower sauce.

Am I right?

No man should have to eat anything
with the word "curd" in it.

You know,
you're turning into a real ass here.

Well,
then I'm finally living up to my potential.

I'm a big old bourbon-soaked,
cigar-huffing ass...

...as God, in his infinite wisdom,
meant me to be.

As he meant all men to be.

You guys are disappointing God.

Okay,
what if a cannibal was on death row?

I guess for being a cannibal.

And he orders Chinese for his last meal,
does he get to eat a Chinese guy?

No.

What if they
just electrocuted a Chinese guy...

...and the cannibal was next?

No.

-He'd already be cooked.
-Stop it.

-Hey.
-Hey, where have you been?

-I had a date with Mia.
-That was two nights ago.

Yeah, well,
I stopped off in Vegas on the way home.

Why?

Because that's where you go
after you destroy a relationship.

Oh, now I understand
why Mia's been calling.

-She sounded pretty upset.
-I didn't tell her anything.

But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you?

Hey, you just paid me once.

Rose has me
on something called a "retainer. "

-So, what happened with Mia?
-No big deal.

I just got tired
of trying to be something I'm not.

-A decent, healthy human being?
-Pretty much.

He's back.

You're damn right I'm back.
Mia and I are through.

You schmuck. She was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

But you said I was whipped.

I didn't mean dump her,
I meant grow a pair.

What is "whipped"?

When a man lets a woman take over
his life and tell him what to do.

Oh, so like you and Mom.

No.

Oh, hi, Mother.

No, no, Mia's not here.
He broke up with her.

Yeah, schmuck seems to be
the general consensus.

-What's a "schmuck"?
-Any guy who's not whipped.

-She wants to talk to you.
-Well, I don't wanna talk to her.

Nice catch, schmuck.

Hi, Mom.

Why am I the bad guy here?

Well, did you ever stop to consider
that maybe this wasn't my fault?

I gotta go, Mom,
my meat connection's here.

It's just weird. I just think that if the guy's
got a front door, we should use it.

-This is fine.
-Okay.

-Hi, Charlie.
-Hello, Rose. What's going on?

Well, I just wanted to introduce you
to Gordon, my new boyfriend.

Oh, no kidding. Hi, Gordon.

Hello.

Gordon and l
are in a committed relationship.

-Right, Gordon?
-Yeah, I guess.

Look, see,
there's stairs right over there. Just--

Anyway...

...I was thinking that you and Mia...

...would like to join us for dinner
one night. You know, double date.

Oh, well, that's nice, Rose,
but I broke up with Mia.

Oh, I see.

Well, then goodbye, Gordon.

I think I made a big mistake.

I know the feeling.

I once ate an egg salad sandwich
I left in my desk over the weekend.

Huge mistake.

My relationship with Mia...

...was the best thing that happened
to me and I threw it away.

That's what I should have done
with the sandwich.

I wonder if it's too late to fix things.

Call her and find out.

But if I do,
I'll be right back where I started...

...trying to be somebody I'm not.

Okay, then find another girlfriend.

I don't want another girlfriend.
I want Mia.

Then call her.

I can't.

I can't live with her,
I can't live without her.

If your plane crashed in the Andes
and she died, could you eat her?

Mia, it's Charlie.

Look, you win. I'll change.
No more meat, I promise.

Come on, Mia.
Come out and smell me.

Mia's not here.
Do I have to smell you?

-Who are you?
-Ginger.

So you're Charlie.

-Yeah, where's Mia?
-Hang on a minute.

She told me to give you this
if you stopped by.

She took a job in New York?
Why'd she do that?

Just read the note.

"l love you too much to try to make you
into something you're not...

...and I love me too much
to settle for who you are. "

That's the part
that always makes me cry.

I can change her mind.
I'll fly to New York tonight.

-Do you have her address?
-Come on in.

-Can I get you something to drink?
-No, thanks.

Hi, American Airlines,
reservations please.

You sure? I got all my boys here.

Jack, Johnnie and Jose.

Maybe a poquito Jose.

Are these actual baby back ribs?

-Yeah, help yourself.
-Thanks.

I'd like to make a reservation
on the redeye to New Y ork tonight.

Hey, do you mind if I turn on the TV?
I've got some money on the Lakers.

-You bet sports?
-I'll bet anything.

I had 200 bucks
on my sister's pregnancy test.

How exactly do you know Mia?

Oh, we used to do the ballet thing
together but I didn't have the discipline.

-No kidding.
-I still dance, but just for tips.

I'll call you back.

You know, I'm thinking
she probably needs her space.

Probably.

-Mind if I hang out and watch the game?
-Be my guest.

If you got cash,
I could give you a lap dance at halftime.

That'd be swell.

.......... ********** ..........

-Morning.
-Morning.

-What are you making?
-Breakfast.

Have you considered orange juice
and a piece of toast?

It's in there.

We got any marshmallows?

And he wonders why he gets diarrhea.

Oh, man.

Did you forget to put the lid on again?

Maybe.

-Well, clean it up.
-Okay.

-ls Jake up yet?
-He's in the kitchen.

-Has he been looking for me?
-Are you a marshmallow?

-What?
-He hasn't been looking for you.

Oh, good.

Sorry I'm late,
but Kandi and I had morning sex.

-Good for you.
-Twice.

Congratulations.

She didn't even wake me up
for the first one.

I almost missed it.

Well, I've always said a 22-year-old girl
is like a good carpenter.

No wood gets wasted.

Well, I wouldn't put it so crudely,
but yeah.

-Morning, buddy.
-Morning.

Why do you let him use the blender?

I'm hoping
he'll eventually stumble into a margarita.

Hey, here's a fun fact.

You're sleeping with a girl who was born
when you were in junior high.

And yet there's a good chance
she lost her virginity before you did.

And here's another fun fact.

I'll bet she's had sex
with more girls than you too.

That is a fun fact.

And you know what else?
Her youth is like an aphrodisiac.

I feel younger, I feel more....
Oh, I don't know how to describe it.

Manly.

I know what you mean.

I'm performing
at what can only be described...

...as a very enhanced level.

-Right.
-You know, between-the-sheets-wise.

-You don't have to tell me.
-Yes, I do.

I have to tell everybody.

I'm just impressed
you can keep up with her.

I thought she'd have worn you down
to a few vertebrae...

...in a pool of spinal fluid.

Well, you know, I exercise, I eat right--

And of course, I've always had a vast,
untapped reservoir of sexual energy...

... bubbling under the surface.

Truth be told, you could drill anywhere
and hit a gusher.

Morning, brother.

We're here to tell you
about The Good News.

Okay, but my news first.

See, I am dating
this 22-year-old woman.

Incredible.

-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Rose, what's up?

I was taking a walk on the beach
with my boyfriend...

...and we thought we'd stop by.

Come on up, lamb chop.

This is ridiculous.

I still don't understand
why we can't use the stairs over there.

-Don't try to change me, Gordon.
-I'm sorry.

So how's it going with you two?

It's just great. Gordon's my soul mate.

-He completes me. We're inseparable.
-Yeah.

Wait here.
I wanna talk to Charlie alone.

-Charlie.
-Coming.

-Lamb chop?
-I'm hot and juicy.

-What's up?
-Don't play innocent with me.

-I can see the hurt in your eyes.
-What?

-You have to let me go, Charlie.
-Okay.

-I'm with Gordon now. I've moved on.
-Good.

And I know it may be hard for you
to hear this...

...but he satisfies all my needs.

Well, he is hot and juicy.

Oh, Charlie.
I can't bear to see you like this.

Like what?

I know I shouldn't...

...but I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

One last chance for what?

You're gonna make me say it,
aren't you?

Say what?

Listen closely. Once I go, I'm gone.

Really?
I've never seen that side of you.

I've never had a man like Gordon.

I believe you.

-So?
-"So," what?

-Who's that?
-Oh, that's Gordon, my boyfriend.

How come he's not allowed in?

I'm trying
to avoid an awkward situation.

-Too late.
-You bringing him to my birthday party?

What do you think, Charlie?
Is the wound too fresh?

I think I can handle it.

Cool.

-Okay. I'm gonna go now.
-All right.

But before I do...

...I think we need to decide
just where we stand.

-You're kidding. Rose has a boyfriend?
-Yep.

A real one,
or, like, Toby the astronaut?

No, this one's real.

-What's he like?
-Nice guy.

He has no idea how close he is
to the woodchipper.

-Hello? Alan, you home?
-Kandi?

What are you doing here?

I thought I'd surprise you
with a booty call.

-Lower your voice.
-Booty call.

What's a booty call?

Well, it's....

You know, this is more the kind of thing
a son should learn from his father.

Oh, okay.

Maybe you should ask him now.

All right.

I'm going to hell.

Look, it's a really sweet gesture,
but this is not a great time.

Hey, Dad, what's a booty call?

Oh, hey. Hey, Jake.
You-- You remember Kandi.

-Sure. Hi, Kandi.
-Hi.

So, what's a booty call?

I figured you didn't want me telling him.
Was I wrong?

Well, Jake, it means...

...that Kandi came by
to do her laundry.

I don't see any laundry.

Good point, Charlie.

Always the eye for detail.

Well, you see, Jake...

...in the Old West...

...cowboys could be out
on the dusty range...

...for months at a time.

And they'd get mighty dirty.

So they'd-- They'd mosey into town...

...with nothing
but the clothes on their backs.

And they'd need to wash them.

So, what they'd do is...

...they would go down to the creek...

...and strip down until they were
wearing nothing but their boots.

Why'd they keep their boots on?

Rattlesnakes.

Anyway, in order to warn people
who were swimming...

...that, you know,
the naked cowboy was on his way...

...he would yell, or, if you will, call:

"Booty.

Booty. "

Ergo, the booty call.

Alan, you really make history fun.

Well, thank you.

So when did it start meaning
"casual sex"?

Why don't you go play a video game
or something?

-Okay.
-Great.

Hey, Kandi, you wanna come
to my birthday party tomorrow?

-Sure. How old are you gonna be?
-Twelve.

Happy bar mitzvah.

Well, this works out well.

When you're not boinking her,
she's got someone to play with.

Weren't you listening?

Jake just invited Kandi
to his birthday party.

Oh, don't worry.
You've still got the inside track.

No.

-I can't let her come to the party.
-Why not?

Why not?
My ex-wife is gonna be there.

All her miserable, middle-aged
soccer-mom friends are gonna be there.

They're gonna take one look
at Kandi's tight, young little body...

...and they are gonna hate me,
hate me with a white-hot hatred...

...of burning...

...hate.

Yeah, sure,
it'll be a little tense at first...

...but you can lighten the mood
with your booty story.

That's powerful funny, partner.

Shut up.

Alan, there comes a time
in every man's life...

...when he has to make a choice.

Does he wanna be loved
or does he wanna get laid?

Fourteen years ago
you made the wrong choice.

You got married.
And you wound up with neither.

But now, now fate has given you
another chance.

Welcome it. Embrace it.

Grab its pert little ass.

What am I supposed to do,
walk into my son's birthday and say:

"Hey, look at this gorgeous 22-year-old
woman I'm having sex with"?

Oh, don't be silly.
You don't wanna rub their faces in it.

You just want them to know
where yours has been.

-Oh, yeah, one more thing.
-Yeah?

Booty. Booty.

Uncle Charlie?

Uncle Charlie, are you awake?

Go away.

Don't you wanna be the first one
to wish me a happy birthday?

-Jake, I swear to God--
-Wait, not yet.

Five, four, three, two, one.
Okay, now.

Get out.

You can give me your present now
if you want to.

If you leave immediately,
I'll give you the gift of life.

All right.

-Hey, how come Dad's not in his room?
-He's out with Kandi.

-When's he coming home?
-Not for a while.

Why doesn't he just
have sex with her here?

What makes you think
he's having sex with her?

I don't know, common sense?

All right. The thing is, he's embarrassed
about having that kind of relationship...

...with somebody
so much younger than him.

Why?

I don't know, maybe he thinks
he's setting a bad example for you.

What am I gonna do,
start dating a 6-year-old?

-Go back to sleep.
-I can't. I'm too excited.

Well, you mind if I go back to sleep?

-Okay. I'll find something to do.
-Great.

-Maybe I'll try to make a pizza.
-Good for you.

Oh, crap.

Pierre?

Have you seen Pierre?

-ls Pierre a cat?
-Yeah.

-Bathroom.
-Thanks. Excuse me.

-Hey.
-Hey. Oh, God.

Still worth it.

Hey, I'm watching that.

Yeah, right.
Happy birthday, you big dope.

-Why am I a big dope?
-When did you finally fall asleep?

How could I possibly know that?

Now you got a party in a couple hours
and you feel like hell, right?

-Yeah.
-Happy birthday, you big dope.

Hey, am I old enough
to have coffee now?

Do you still think
armpit farts are funny?

-Yeah.
-Then no.

Come on,
I could really use a pick-me-up.

-Okay, how do you want it?
-I don't know, in a cup?

Good choice.

-You feel better?
-Yeah, I think it's working.

You know, Kandi, you don't
have to feel obligated to go to this party.

It's just gonna be a lot of kids
playing silly games.

Are there gonna be balloon animals?
Because I love those.

No, Jake's a little old for that.

Balloon animals are
a very underappreciated art form, Alan.

Just give me a minute to get ready.

Okay.

You know, it's probably gonna be
a very, very dull party.

I wouldn't be going myself
if I weren't related to the kid.

And without balloon animals,
you gotta ask yourself:

"ls it really worth the trip? "

How do I look?

I'm-- I'm sorry,
I think I swallowed my tongue.

Thank you.

It's amazing. My ex-wife
would take hours getting ready...

...and the end result
wouldn't be nearly so...

...this.

Maybe I can give her a few tips
at the party.

Oh, gee.

-She doesn't respond well to tips.
-Okay. Anything else?

Well...

...even before I say it,
I know it sounds insane...

...but do you think
you could put on a few more clothes?

-Don't I look okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, you look terrific.

It's just, I wouldn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

-About?
-About....

Maybe if you just put on a jacket
and a hat.

Do you have a poncho?

-Are you ashamed of me?
-No. No, I'm proud of you.

In fact, I'm so proud that yesterday...

...I almost signed up to be
a Christian missionary in the Sudan.

But you don't want
your family and friends to see me.

Good, you understand.

You know, Alan,
my friends are judgmental too.

-About what?
-About you.

None of them get why I'm with you.

Well...

...at the risk of shining a light
on something better left unexamined...

...why are you with me?

Because you're cute and smart
and really, really grateful.

All true.

And if my friends can't understand that,
well, then tough tomatoes.

-Kandi, you're a remarkable girl.
-Thank you.

Unfortunately, so am l.

Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

You wanna have a quickie in the car?

Well, all right.
But this time let's pull over first.

Boring.

So where's Alan? He's supposed to be
pitching in at this party.

I don't know, but I'm guessing
that wherever he is, he's pitching.

So I suppose Charlie hasn't told you.
I have a new man in my life.

Oh, good for you, dear.
Does the man know yet?

Hey, get your own, Red.

Nice outfit.

-Thanks. Rose picked it out for me.
-How about that?

You know,
sometimes when we're having sex...

...she calls out your name.

No kidding?
What about the other times?

She makes me call it out.

Boy, that really wasn't a quickie,
was it?

The first one was.

Anyway, so just to reiterate,
today is Jake's day.

-It's not about us.
-I know.

So you can just relax.

And don't feel obligated to, you know,
socialize or talk to anybody.

Don't worry, Alan.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.

Right, I know you won't.

So to summarize what I reiterated,
we're just gonna play it cool, low-key.

Nothing to be gained
by drawing attention to ourselves.

I got it.

Just don't ring the doorbell.

Sorry we're late...

...but I was having sex
with this gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

Wait, wait, wait.

Okay. Come in and say that again.

Jake? You in here?
It's time to do the birthday cake.

Go away.

-Did you find him?
-Yeah, he's in the bathroom.

-ls he okay?
-I don't know.

-Jake, are you okay?
-I'm fine. Go away.

He's probably humiliated because
his father is dating a Camp Fire Girl.

-Give it a rest, Judith.
-What's going on?

-Jake won't come out of the bathroom.
-Come on out, honey.

-I can't.
-Why not?

I just can't.

I was wondering
where everyone snuck off to.

Whatever you're saying about me,
you can say right to my face.

This isn't about you, Mom.

-Wish I could believe that.
-What's the holdup?

-He won't come out of the bathroom.
-He sick?

-Who won't come out?
-Your grandson.

Why? Is he mad at me?

-Jake, what have you had to eat today?
-Just a little coffee and some vitamins.

-Coffee? You let him have coffee?
-No. You let him have coffee?

-He had a sip.
-Well, wait a second.

-Why did you take vitamins?
-I was tired.

Okay, but where did you find vitamins
to take?

In your medicine cabinet.

I don't have any vitamins
in my medicine cabinet.

Yeah, you do.
The little blue ones with a V on them.

-What's going on? I don't understand.
-The kid's gonna need another party hat.

.......... ********** ..........

So any thoughts on what
you'd like for dinner this weekend?

You decide, honey.
I love everything you cook.

All of a sudden I'm a woman...

...because I cook and try to make
a nice home for you?

Okay, I heard it too. Shut up.

Ramming speed!

-Jake.
-Leave him alone.

With his grades, he might as well get
used to pushing shopping carts around.

My son is gonna
end up working in a supermarket?

No, I'm saying he's probably
gonna end up homeless.

Well, as I live and breathe,
Charlie Harper.

Oh, great. Archie.

So how's the best jingle writer
in the business?

Looks like he's put on a few pounds.

This is my brother Alan.

Alan, Archie Baldwin,
the king of the jingle writers.

Well, I don't know about that.

More like the ayatollah
of the jingle writers.

The grand Pooh-Bah, if you will.

Really?
What's that make you, Charlie?

T o be honest, a little nauseous.

We should get together sometime.
Maybe collaborate.

-I'd like that.
-Well, sure, there's no downside for you.

What the hell, remind me about it
at the awards dinner.

Oh, I'm not going to that.

Why not? You're nominated.

Wait, what are you nominated for?

It's a silly advertising award.
Doesn't mean anything.

Yeah, he's right. It's not about
the trophies, it's about the work.

PS, my work has won seven trophies.

Hey, one more, I'll have a menorah.

Well, good luck, Archie.
But I think I'll pass.

Oh, well, good for you.
Stay home and sulk.

Nice meeting you.

Okay, where do they keep
the extra-large condoms?

Boy, he's a piece of work.

He's a piece of something.

How come you never
mentioned that whole award thing?

I've been nominated plenty of times.

-How many times have you won?
-What difference does it make?

So never.

Yes, Alan, never.

But that guy Archie
has won like seven times.

Yes, he has.

That's gotta sting.

Hey, Alan, you ever been beaten
to death with a can of corn?

Toe-Zene shouldn 't be used
by pregnant women...

...people with heart conditions
or taking SSI inhibitors.

I don't know. This could be my year.

-I really think it's your best work.
-Thanks.

I know I said the same thing
about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm.

Yeah.

Just Like a Woman Natural Douche.

And that hemorrhoid cream.
What was it called?

Fire in the Hole.

Yeah, that was good.

But Toe-Zene is the one
that's finally gonna bring home the gold.

-Thanks for your support, Rose.
-You're welcome.

Now, can you do something for me?

No.

Oh, come on, Charlie.

I want you to talk to my boyfriend.

Why would I wanna talk
to your boyfriend?

Because he's smothering me.

And not in the good "can you move
your thigh off my face" kind of way.

I need my space, Charlie.

I wake up in the morning
and there he is staring at me.

I have a bowl of soup
and there he is blowing on it for me.

Even when we have sex...

...I can feel his eyes
burning a hole in the back of my head.

Oh, that's gonna keep me up at night.

You need to explain to him that if you
love someone, you have to let them go.

If they come back, they're yours.

If they don't, then you stalk them.

I really don't wanna get involved
in your love life.

Well, if someone doesn't talk to him,
we're gonna have to break up.

Do what you have to do.

Oh, I get it.

You want me to be single again.

Get him over here.

Thank you.

Was that so hard?

I had no idea these awards
were so prestigious.

They're meaningless crap.

Come on. Look at this list
of past winners for best jingle.

Barry Manilow, Randy Newman,
Kenny Loggins...

...Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin
Archie Baldwin, Archie--

What's your point?

My point is
it's an honor just to be nominated.

No, no, it's an honor to win.

Being nominated
is just a soul-sucking waste of time.

Why are you so sure
you're gonna lose?

It doesn't matter
who wrote the best jingle...

...it's about
who has the sexiest product.

That's why the awards
always go to car and beer ads.

Over-the-counter medications
just aren't hip enough.

-That hardly seems fair.
-Tell me about it.

Encourage people to get drunk
and drive fast, great, here's an award.

Relieve the heartbreak
of vaginal itching?

They don't even wanna
shake your hand.

Well, win or lose,
you should still go to the ceremony.

No, no, no. No. An awards
ceremony is like a Thai massage.

If you don't know that there's gonna be
a happy ending, no point in lying down.

You have a family who's proud
of your accomplishments...

...and might like the chance
to share them.

What family is that?

Your family: Me, Jake, Mom.

Whoa, do not tell Mom
about this nomination.

-It's a good thing.
-lt doesn't matter.

If it's a good thing
she'll find a way to make it bad.

-Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.
-Oh, really?

Let's try a little experiment.

I'll pretend I'm Mom,
you tell me something good.

All right.

Hey, Mom,
I have discovered a cure for cancer.

Very nice.

Shame you couldn't do it in time
to save Uncle Walter's left testicle.

Come on, give me another one.

-No, I get the idea.
-No, no. no. Hit me.

Okay.

Gee, Mom,
it really is a beautiful day, huh?

Try telling that
to Uncle Walter's one good nut.

Okay.

I adore my son.

Somebody has to.

-How about friendship?
-How about Judas?

-Family.
-Manson.

-Puppies.
-Rabies.

-Love.
-Communicable disease.

-You win.
-Quitter.

-Leave me alone.
-You're already alone.

Your wife threw you out, remember?

Damn it, Gordon, get up there
and talk to Charlie.

But I don't wanna talk to Charlie.

Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

Hey, Charlie.

Hey, Gordon.

-What's going on?
-Oh, not much.

I was just passing by,
thought I'd see how you were doing.

I'm doing fine.

Good.

Good.

Nice shirt.

Right back at you.

So...

...Rose says I have to talk to you
or I can't have sex with her anymore.

I see. You sure you're making
the right choice?

Call me crazy.

Well, crazy's the price of admission
for that ride.

Okay, come here, sit down.

-You want a beer?
-Oh, no, thank you.

I'm a really mean drunk.

I sensed that.

Anyway, the thing you need
to understand about Rose...

...about any woman really, is
that they want what they can't have.

But Rose can have me.

Trust me on this, Gordon.

You play it cool, keep your distance,
be aloof...

...you'll have to call the cops
to get rid of her.

-You really think so?
-No, I know so.

But they won't come right away.

She'll still have time to hot-glue
her high school graduation picture...

...to your freshly shaved ass.

Hey, Mom, here's some good news.

It seems with medical breakthroughs...

...the average life span
will soon be 1 00 years.

Wonderful. More time to be ignored
by your children.

Amazing.

Morning, Mom.
You're looking very pretty today.

That's nice, because inside I'm dead.

When you're right, you're right.

Charlie, I need a favor.

Yeah, well, I need a healthy liver,
and there's a long waiting list for both.

I've got a client coming into town
next Saturday.

-And he's bringing his lovely daughter.
-And by lovely she means dog-like.

All right, she may not be a beauty queen,
but she does have a terrific figure.

I'm guessing six nipples.

Anyhow, I was hoping you could show
her a good time. No big deal.

You don't have to take her to dinner.

Go to the beach and throw a stick
till she gets tired.

Gee, Mom, as much as I'd love to
service the unfortunate little schnauzer...

-...I'm busy next Saturday.
-What are you doing?

I-- I've-- I've got a-- I've got a thing.

Don't lie. You've got nothing,
you just don't want to help me.

No, no, no. No, I swear, I have plans.

I'm going to this awards ceremony.

You never go to these things.

Yeah, well, this year's different.

Your client's daughter will just have
to hump somebody else's leg.

I told you I could get him to go.

This is really boring.

Just keep it to yourself, Jake.

I just don't understand
why I had to come.

You're here to support
your Uncle Charlie.

The same way he supported you
at your Christmas pageant.

The one where you stood
in back picking lint off your antlers...

...while the rest of the class recited
"The Night Before Kwanzaa. "

Oh, yeah.

-Uncle Charlie?
-What?

Now you have to come
to my Easter pageant.

-This event isn't televised, is it?
-No.

Well, I guess they only show
the important awards.

Congratulations, you've just been elected
tonight's designated driver.

Come on, just ignore her.

Ignore her? It'd be easier to ignore
blood in my urine.

Well, well, well,
look who decided to be a good sport.

Speaking of blood in my urine.

Hey, Archie.

Hey, I wanna tell you people...

...this man has been a real inspiration
to me.

-Oh, come on.
-No, no, I mean it.

When I'm struggling to write a jingle
and I feel like I'm not measuring up...

...I ask myself,
"How would Charlie Harper write this? "

And the answer always makes me feel
better about my own work.

Charlie, aren't you going
to introduce me?

Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom.

You're Charlie's mother?

Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt.

How brave of you to keep him.

Well, aren't you adorable.

Mom. Archie is nominated
in the same category as Charlie.

Oh, well, I'll be rooting for you,
Archie.

-Okay, then, thanks for stopping by.
-Good luck.

-You deserve it this year.
-Thanks.

I mean, how many times
can they snub you?

-I don't really keep track.
-Seven.

Seven years in a row.

If you say so.

Hey, stick around after the ceremony.

If I win, I'll let you hold my trophy.

Not to mention the little statue
they give me.

Isn't the little statue the trophy?

Just eat your chicken.

Before we present
the Jingle of the Y ear Award...

...we have a special treat.

Please tell me
they're gonna pass out guns.

Our very own seven-time
award winner...

...here to perform
his own nominated tune...

...composed especially for the United
Nations Save-an-Orphan program--

Oh, God, not orphans.

Archie Baldwin.

Oh, goodie.

This is for all the orphans out there.

There's no tree at Christmastime

No pumpkin Hallow 's Eve

No candles on the birthday cake

No reason to believe

He works all day in a cold, dark mine

His little lungs filled with soot

Her mommy's Kim Jong 's concubine

Her dad was killed
By the Tonton Macoutes

Save the orphans

Save the orphans

Don 't do it for me

Don 't do it for you

Do it for little Kim Sung

And Abu

Yeah, save the orphans

Come on, everybody.

Save the orphans

They' re tax-deductible.

Save the orphans

Get them while they' re still cute.

Save the orphans

Get them young,
teach them your tongue.

Save the orphans

Woody Allen can't marry them all.

Save the orphans

Some of them
don't even have parents.

Save the orphans

Get two, get one free.

Save the orphans

Use them as bait for scholarships.

Save the orphans

Save the orphans

Save the orphans

Enough.

Come on. It's catchy.

So is diphtheria.

How come you don't get
a runner-up trophy?

Because I don't.

At school everybody gets a trophy
just for participating.

Well, Jake, that's the difference
between school and life.

In life all you get for participating is pain,
loneliness and death.

Better luck next year, Charlie.

Good night, boys.

Oh, yeah, I forgot.

There's also crushing humiliation.

Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy.

Hey, can I get you anything?

A length of rope and a rickety stool?

Charlie, it's understandable that you
might be a little blue right now...

...but that will pass.

Get out of here, Alan.

You know, I often find that
when things look darkest...

...it really helps to share your--

I swear, I will drop-kick you
over that railing.

Alrighty.

Pleasant dreams.

You don't dream in a blackout,
you moron.

-Hey, Charlie.
-Oh, God.

-How did it go tonight?
-Let me put it this way:

What the advertising community
did to me earlier this evening...

...Archie Baldwin is now doing
to my mother.

He's not acknowledging
her wonderful talent?

-Just leave it alone, Rose.
-Sorry.

Have you seen Gordon?

Not since I talked to him.

And by the way,
thanks for that opportunity.

I've always wanted to bond
with a pasty kid who dresses like me.

Well, I don't know what you said to him,
but he's been acting very strange lately.

Lately?

I keep calling,
but he doesn't pick up the phone.

And when I leave a message,
he doesn't call back.

I thought you wanted him to stop
being so clingy.

I thought I did too.

Now I miss his cute little face
peeking at me...

...while I'm washing my hair, shaving my
legs, soaping up my breasts...

...which you no doubt remember
are extremely firm and perky.

So he spies on you in the shower?

No, that would be weird.

Why is love so complicated?

I don't know, Rose.

Stuff happens.

Oh, Charlie, you always know
the right thing to say.

This is a fine kettle of fish.

Oh, why can't I just black out
in peace?

"Be aloof," you said,
"play hard to get. "

You just wanted me out of your way
so you could make your move.

You caught me, Gordon.

Now, do the right thing and kill me.

Oh, Charlie, is this true?

Is this part of some devious plan
to win me back?

You heard her, Gordon. Kill me.

Rose, you wanted him out of your hair.
I got him out of your hair.

-You wanted to get rid of me?
-No, I just need some space.

You want space?
I'll give you all the space you want.

-Fine.
-ln fact, I'll leave right now.

Well, great.
I'll just stay here with Charlie.

Nobody leaves.

Nobody stays.

Rose, get off me.

Okay, now, everybody
listen carefully...

...because I'm pretty sure
I'm only gonna be able to say this once.

Rose, think about it.

Where are you gonna find a guy
who loves you as much as Gordon?

And, Gordon, where are you gonna find
a girl, period.

The man makes sense, Rose.

You're damn right I make sense.

If you kids don't patch things up,
you know what's gonna happen?

You're gonna wind up old,
miserable and alone.

He's right, Gordon.

Look what happened to him.

I love you, Rose.

I love you too.

Oh, good, a happy ending.

Now, get the hell off my deck.

-Come on, Lambchop, let's go home.
-Hold on.

Climbing over the rail
is ridiculous and juvenile.

From now on, I wanna take the stairs.

Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

Call me crazy.

And the real winner tonight...

...is Charlie Harper.

A man with a heart so big...

...that he'd step outside of his own
misery to help two people in need.

Alan, I'm warning you.

I know you don't wanna hear this.
Let me tell you.

The Archie Baldwins of this world
are soon forgotten.

It's people like you, people
who are selfless and generous...

...who will live on forever.

Last chance.

Oh, please, that grumpy-gus routine
does not-- Good night.

.......... ********** ..........

Alan, I forgot my toothbrush.
Can I use yours?

Oh, dear Lord, no.

Do you have any idea
how many bacteria...

...can be transferred
on a toothbrush?

I don't know. How many?

Okay, I don't know
the actual amount.

Then why did you bring it up?

Poor judgment.

The point is, sharing these things
is a bad idea.

Are you saying you don't want
your toothbrush in my mouth--?

I know, I know.
I get the hypocrisy. Just humor me.

Okay, I have hard,
medium or soft bristles.

I have straight or curved handles.

And for your flossing needs...

...I have waxed, mint-waxed,
un-waxed.

If you're feeling especially adventurous,
may I suggest the cinnamon?

Maybe I'll just wait till I get home.

No, no. One day you skip brushing
and before you know it...

...your teeth rot away and you're
begging strangers to start your apple.

Fine. I'll take the pink one.

I always wondered, what's
the rubber thing at the end for?

It's to massage your gums.

Oh, I thought it might be an eraser.

But who writes
when they're brushing their teeth?

I don't know.

What's the matter?

Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Well, I kind of have to pee.

-Go ahead.
-Oh, no, I'll wait till you're finished.

Are you shy about peeing
in front of me? Because, Alan--

Again, I get the hypocrisy.

I think it's important to keep
a little mystery in a relationship.

It's just peeing, Alan.

Not necessarily.

Sometimes when a man urinates...

...other muscles see that
as a green light to relax.

So you've never peed
in front of a girl?

Well, my ex-wife, but after six,
seven years of marriage...

...who gives a damn anymore?

-Okay, I'll brush out here.
-Thank you.

-What?
-One of my teeth hurts when I brush it.

When was the last time
you saw a dentist?

Alan, I see people all the time.

They don't always tell you
what they do.

Hey, are you done?
Because I gotta rinse.

No, I can't go
when I know you're listening.

Would it help if I sang
the pee-pee song?

-The what?
-My mom used to sing it to me.

Tinkle, tinkle, little star
In the potty not the car

Up above the bowl so high
Like the raindrops in the sky

Hey, hey, it's working.

Green light.

Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

-Should I try it again?
-Not yet.

Okay, now.

Okay, stop, stop, stop.

Morning.

-Morning.
-Morning, Charlie.

Need any help?

Do you know how to get
a 1 981 Plymouth Duster moving?

Y eah, yank out the eight track
and push it off a cliff.

You're useless.

Sorry.

-You got a little grease on your face.
-Where?

Cheek.

Did I get it?

No, other side.

-Now?
-Little on your forehead.

-Yeah?
-Perfect.

Now sing "Swanee River. "

Alan, should I try it again?

No. I'm gonna call AAA.

Good. No sense drinking over this.

You must be so proud.

Hey, she may not be sophisticated,
but she's street-smart.

Sesame Street-smart.

Just leave it alone.

Let me ask you something.
Have you stopped to consider...

...the long-term cost of a relationship
with a girl that young?

Charlie, it's a free tow.

Oh, sure. That's how it always starts,
with a free tow.

But who's gonna pay to fix the car
after it's towed?

"Um" is right, my dim-witted friend.

And that's just the beginning.

Girls like Kandi need
all kinds of stuff...

...the only way they can pay for it
is through horny morons like you.

Her car breaks down
and I should just dump her?

-This is a short-term relationship?
-I don't know.

Trust me,
it's a short-term relationship.

Kandi's not the brightest bulb
in the chandelier...

...but even she's gonna wake up...

...wonder what she's doing
shacked up with a penniless putz...

...who's twice her age.

Kandi's not like that.

Just wait.

Your first minor stroke and she'll be
boinking the cardiologist...

...before you can scrawl
"What happened? " on your note pad.

Okay, for the sake of argument...

...Iet's say you're right,
what's your point?

My point is, you don't dry-clean
a rented tuxedo.

You don't redecorate a hotel room.

You don't order cable
for a port-a-potty...

...unless you're really, really drunk.

And you don't take
on the bills of a girl...

...that's got the attention span of
a monkey chewing on a fly swatter.

Okay, I appreciate your...

...how shall I describe it,
compassionate advice...

...but all I'm doing here
is arranging a free tow for a friend.

Alan, I don't think
the engine's flooded anymore.

-Fire extinguisher?
-Under the sink.

Hey, if you don't hurry up,
you'll be late.

I don't mind.

Okay, well, that takes
the pressure off.

How come my dad's not bringing me?

-He's helping Kandi get her car fixed.
-Oh, jeez.

And him already broker
than a headless hooker.

Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi?

What gave you the idea
she hates her?

Because she says so.

A lot.

All right. Why do you think?

I don't know.
She's pretty, she's fun...

...and Dad seems real happy with her.

Well, little man, you just answered
your own question.

I did? What'd I say?

It's like this.
You ever see a kid at school...

...who doesn't like his lunch
but he won't let you have it?

Oh, yeah, Russell Beasley.

He'll spit on his apple cobbler
before he'll let anybody else eat it.

This is pretty much the same deal,
except your mom is Russell Beasley...

...and your dad
is the spit-covered cobbler.

I don't understand.

Though your mom
doesn't want your dad...

...she doesn't want Kandi
to eat him either.

You know,
I like cobbler with ice cream.

Way to follow a train of thought.

Thanks.

Well, I guess we should go
to school now.

Couldn't hurt.

I'll see if I can find my books.

Sweet kid.

Yeah.

Shame he'll never be anything
more than a burden to society.

Do you know a good lawyer, Alan?

No, but my ex-wife does.

-Why?
-Because I wanna sue the guy...

...who sold me that lemming.

-You mean lemon.
-I do?

Okay.

Did you get any kind of a written
guarantee when you bought it?

No, it was more of an oral agreement.

All right, Mr. Harper,
I looked at your daughter's vehicle.

She's not my daughter.

Good for you.

Anyway,
the prognosis looks rather bleak.

-I understand.
-I mean, the vehicle was on fire.

I know.

What, is she like 21?

-Twenty-two.
-And a half.

Good for you.

-Yeah, what about the car?
-Oh, the car?

The cars gotta be 25, 26 years old.

-I mean, can it be fixed?
-Anything can be fixed.

Hell, they put a pig's heart
in my Uncle Vinnie.

-How much?
-All of it.

My Aunt Phyllis likes to call him
the other white meat now.

No, I mean how much to fix the car?

For you, three grand.

What?

Once again, the car was on fire.

I had to wait an hour
before I could even touch it.

But I only paid 800 for it.

Eight hundred dollars?

I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings,
but some business person...

...has taken advantage
of your good nature.

Boy, that happens a lot.

Well, 3000 is out of the question.

It'd make more sense
just to get her a new car.

Oh, Alan, thank you.

That's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

Good for you.

-Hi.
-Hey.

Why isn't your car in the garage?

I loaned it to Kandi.

And how much are you paying
to fix hers?

For your information, nothing.

Nothing?

Not a cent.

I'm leasing her a Saturn.

Tell me again about the free tow,
Alan.

Come on, she needs a car...

...and the lease terms
are surprisingly reasonable.

They're practically giving them away.

Excuse me.

Where are you going?

I'm gonna solve all your problems.

Wanna see it coming
or should I surprise you?

You're not funny.

Hello?

Hang on a second.

It's your dentist, he wants to talk
to you about Kandi's teeth.

Thank you.

Hi, Dr. Weinberger.

Thanks for seeing her
on such short notice.

Can I have some privacy, please?

Sure, get your own place.

No, she's not covered
under my dental plan.

Twenty-two and a half.

Yeah, yeah, good for me.

Did you get a chance
to look at her tooth?

Oh, a root canal.

Well, how much is that?

What do you mean there's more?

Who told you
to look at her wisdom teeth?

That girl's got wisdom teeth?

Okay, what's the worst thing
that could happen...

... if you don't take them out?

How infected?

All right, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

Yeah, send me the bill.

Okay, bye-bye.

Here.

Aim for the cheap seats.

Alan, what are you doing?

You know,
a little bit of a cash-flow crunch...

...and I thought I'd use this
to pay some bills.

I see.

Mind helping me out?

Sure.

Promise me you'll spend it on food,
not whiskey.

My pain brings you
a lot of pleasure, huh?

I'm a simple man.

It's your ex-wife.

Oh, perfect. Get the bat.

This is the bat.

Hello?

Oh, good. I was hoping it'd be you.

Of course I remember the Alamo.

Oh, you mean alimony.

I was thinking Davy Crockett,
Jim Bowie.

Oh, come on, Judith,
why can't we share a few chuckles?

Oh, no, no, I agree.

There's nothing chuckle-worthy
about a subpoena.

Well, you know, I will tell you what.

I will bring you the check
when I pick up Jake.

I promise.

Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

You gotta pick up Jake.

-Why?
-Because I don't have her money.

It's in Kandi's mouth and Kandi's car.

What about The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre over there?

This? This is nothing.

One car payment
and maybe a bikini wax.

-Bikini wax?
-A girl's gotta keep those up.

It's a landscaping issue.

You just gotta buy me some time
with Judith.

What are you gonna do
with more time?

You can't sell your blood,
your ex-wife already took that.

And if you sell your sperm,
what's the point in dating Kandi?

Well, for your information,
I do have other options.

-Like what?
-I've been looking at part-time work.

And I have some very promising
auctions on eBay.

Oh, really? What are you auctioning?

Well, a few rare books,
a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs.

Since when do you play golf?

Well, technically, they're your clubs.

You're stealing from me?

Oh, come on, you only bought them...

...so you could go to Palm Springs
and pick up lesbians.

This is ridiculous.

Why don't you just ask me
to lend you some money?

-Would you lend me money?
-Absolutely.

If I hadn't taken a bath
on the Super Bowl.

Well, I need to do this by myself
anyway.

You know, I still have my pride.

Wow, you really think that, huh?

Well, it doesn't matter
as long as I have Kandi.

She looks up to me,
she thinks I'm special.

She thinks I'm smart.

She thinks gazpacho
is Pinocchio's father.

What can I say, Charlie?
I'm crazy about her.

All right, I certainly don't wanna
stand in the way of your happiness.

Thank you.

-One question though.
-Yeah?

What are you gonna tell Jake...

...when he notices
his change jug is gone?

Oh, it'll be okay.
I left him a post-dated check.

It'll be good
by the time he goes to college.

Yeah, like that kid's going to college.

-Perfect, just perfect.
-Judith, I know what you're thinking--

I'll tell you what,
your brother's a little coward...

...who don't have guts
to face his responsibilities--

There's more to this
than meets the eye.

I suppose you're gonna explain it
to me.

I'm gonna try if you'll calm down
for a minute and listen.

-All right, I'm listening.
-Are you calm?

I'm listening.

Okay. You know why Alan's not here?
Because he's ashamed.

-Well, he should be.
-Judith, that's not listening.

He's ashamed because
no matter how hard he works...

...he just can't seem to get ahead.

You know,
his business is falling apart.

Really? He hasn't said anything.

Because he's too proud.

Poor guy lost all his chiropractic
walk-ins...

...to an unlicensed massage parlor...

...that opened up right between him
and the Jamba Juice.

-You're kidding.
-I'm deadly serious.

Who's gonna pay
to have their spine adjusted...

...when for half the price
they can get their dingus dusted?

Well, I wouldn't know about that.

As it turns out,
I'm a bit of an expert.

And I'm telling you,
he's going under.

Oh, my God.

-You know he took a part-time job?
-No.

But you didn't hear it from me.

And please,
please don't say anything to Jake.

The last thing Alan wants...

...is to look like a failure in the eyes
of that little boy in there.

Of course not.

-I won't say a word.
-Thank you.

Hey, where's Dad?

Just go with Uncle Charlie.

Okay.

Why is Mom crying?

Because I'm good.

I'm very, very good.

I'm really getting tired of pizza.

Well, I'm off to work.

Get used to it.

Enjoy your pizza.

Alan, Alan, what are you doing?

I swear to God, I'll get your alimony
as soon as possible.

-No, please, don't worry about it.
-Really?

Charlie told me what's going on.

-I don't need the money right now.
-Really?

I haven't mentioned it.
When my grandmother passed away...

...she left me
a pretty substantial inheritance.

Really?

In fact, I want you to have this.

-Really?
-Pay me when you can.

The important thing is
you get back on your feet.

I'm so happy.

Hi, Huggy Bear.

Boy, I love the new car you got me.

Hi, Mrs. Harper,
doesn't he look cute in a mustache?

I'm so sad.

How's that pride doing?

Nice, they let you take a few home.

It's in lieu of health insurance.

Did you know they actually have
a little machine...

...that shoots the cheese
into the crust?

-ls that so?
-Yep.

It's a little high-pressure gun.

You can't kill yourself with it,
though.

I tried.

I gotta tell you something, Alan,
this is from the bottom of my heart.

I think that you are the stupidest man
on the face of the Earth...

...but I admire your perseverance.

You're gonna have
to talk into the other ear.

This one's full of cheese.

Is that my Huggy Bear?

Yeah, it's him.

Hey, guess what.

You know my roommates Ellie
and Emmett?

Yeah.

Turns out they're not really
brother and sister...

...so they started sleeping together.

Oh, that's lovely.

Anyway, now they're gonna get
their own place...

...and I don't know how
I'm gonna pay the rent by myself.

Oh, God, Kandi, I can't. I can't.
I'm all tapped out.

All I have left to put on eBay
is a kidney or a lung.

If I were you, I'd sell the kidney
because lungs don't grow back.

I'm sorry, honey...

...you're just gonna have to handle
your living situation on your own.

Okay. Hey, guess what else.

You've got a loved one who needs
either an operation or bail?

No, silly. I'm finished with the dentist
and my mouth is all better.

See?

Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't you move in with me?

Okay.

I'm so screwed.

.......... ********** ..........

You're up early.

Well, it's a beautiful day,
shame to waste it sleeping.

-Must've got to bed early then.
-I guess.

Well, you know what they say.

Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy and can't get laid, huh?

Maybe I'm not trying.

Y eah. And look for me next month
on the cover of Maxim.

I'll have nothing on but the vacuum.

-Hey, you're up early.
-Y es, Alan, I'm up early.

I went to bed early and I slept alone.
Anything else you wanna know?

Was I this cranky
when I wasn't having sex?

No,
you were more of a sullen whiner.

-Okay, Huggy Bear, I gotta go.
-Oh, all right, Kandi, have a good day.

Yo, Daisy Mae.

Just out of curiosity, when you
leave here, where is it you go?

T o the gym. I have to take care
of my body because it's my instrument.

Mine too.

Three beers and a bratwurst
and my ass turns into a French horn.

Really? Whenever I have beer
and bratwurst I just fart a lot.

Okay. Okay, Kandi, well,
I'll see you tonight.

Bye, everybody.

Congratulations, Alan.

It looks like you've officially
boinked her brains out.

Okay, so she's not
overly sophisticated.

Sophisticated? She's two marbles
rolling around in a tin can.

Hey, hey, she's got a great heart,
she's warm and loving.

-And she genuinely cares for me.
-I stand corrected.

One marble.

Look, buddy, I'm happy
you finally found an instrument to play...

...that isn't in your own pants.

But she's been spending
a lot of time here.

If you're not careful,
she's gonna wanna move in.

Would that be so bad?

Hey, I don't have a lot of rules
around here...

...but nine of the top ten
are just different ways of saying:

"Women are not allowed
to live here. "

They come and they go.

Often they do one of those multiple
times, but in the end they always go.

But why is that so important?

Alan, there's a natural balance
in this house, which must not be upset.

It's like the Amazon rain forest.

You bring in one too many
spider monkeys...

...you're up to your ass in tree frogs.

Oh tree frogs.
That clears up everything.

Don't patronize me,
you hump-happy simpleton.

-You know what I'm saying.
-I do.

If Kandi were to move in here,
it would be an environmental disaster...

-...of epic proportions.
-Exactly.

She's been living here
the past three weeks.

-What?
-Who's the simpleton now?

Kandi got evicted from her apartment
three weeks ago and she moved in here.

Oh, please, if a woman was living
in my own house for that long...

...I think I'd notice.

Oh, really? Really?
Well, let's try a little experiment.

What color is the couch
in the living room?

-The couch?
-No peeking. What color is it?

Well, it's kind of a--

Beige-ish--

Tan.

-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

-Go look.
-Fine.

What the hell is that?

Your couch.

Jake spilled grape juice on it
last summer.

I had it reupholstered.

-Last summer?
-Yeah, it was gone almost a month.

Berta and I bet
on how long it would take you to notice.

I had 50 bucks on never.

All right, all right this is unacceptable.

This is my house and if furniture's
gonna get reupholstered or moved...

...or changed in any way whatsoever,
I demand to be consulted.

-Okay, from now on. I promise.
-Thank you.

I bought the damn thing.

Think I'd have a vote,
maybe show me a swatch.

Hey, wait a minute,
did somebody say Kandi's living here?

Boy, am I thirsty.

That's because you sweat so much
during sex.

I may not have the biggest boat
in the marina.

But nobody rows harder than me.

You have a boat?

-No, sweetie, what I meant was--
-Hey, hey, hey.

Some of us don't wanna hear
about your little dinghy.

-Oh, hi, Charlie.
-What're you doing here?

I was asking myself the same thing...

...so I did a little research
and it turns out it's my house.

Yeah, but I thought
you were going out.

-I did go out. And then I came back.
-Alone?

No, Alan, I brought home
an invisible cocktail waitress.

She's doing me even as we speak.

You're right. There's no way
you could've been that cranky.

You want some company, Charlie?

Alan can't have sex again
for at least 30 minutes.

That's a rough estimate.

Thanks, but I'd really rather be alone.

Okey-doke. Come on,
I think he wants to masturbate.

Not for at least 30 minutes.

Okay, I haven't sampled anything
from the other side of the buffet...

...since I traveled
with the Grateful Dead.

But golly Moses, she's a muffin.

Interesting turn of events, huh?

Your brother hitting
one of your hand-me-downs.

And you couldn't get laid if you
painted your penis to look like money.

Don't think I haven't tried.

I'm reminded of the tale
of the tortoise and the hare.

Isn't there something
you could be doing?

Well, I could go rub some oil on her,
but I don't trust myself.

Berta, please don't take this
the wrong way...

...but it's been a long time for me
and you're starting to turn me on.

I'm out of here.

-Hi, Berta.
-Hey, baby.

-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

-Boy, this is weird, huh?
-ln so many ways.

But which one caught your attention?

Well, I've never slept
with brothers before.

I mean at different times.

And one can't help
but make comparisons.

No kidding.

So how big a difference
are we talking about?

It's huge.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

With you, sex is kind of
like going on Space Mountain.

It's a good ride,
but there's never any real danger.

With Alan, it's like being
in the back seat of a car...

...driven by a really smart kangaroo.

He may go up on the curb
a couple times, but he'll get you there.

Okay.

Thanks for clearing that up.

I'll get it.

There's a two hour wait
for Space Mountain.

-Hi, Mrs. Harper.
-Oh, dear lord.

Hey, Kandi,
I got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox.

Sweet.

Kandi, maybe you'd like to go
put some clothes on.

-Why?
-Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody.

I just don't think that outfit
is appropriate for Jake.

Oh, I agree.
He would look ridiculous in this.

Can you get Alan for me?

-He's not back from work yet.
-He's not?

-Then what are you doing here?
-I live here now. Didn't Alan tell you?

No, he did not.

-Charlie, I wanna talk to you.
-Good to know.

Charlie, get over here.

It was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper.

What in God's name
does she see in him?

Well, I don't have all the details,
Mrs. Harper.

But apparently
when he's not being emasculated...

...and demoralized on a daily basis,
he's quite the lover.

-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what they say.

Your average man's
like a good field mule.

If you don't beat him,
he'll keep plowing all day long.

-Nobody says that.
-You're hard to fool.

Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm tired of talking to you.

Had an interesting chat
with your ex-wife.

Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner?

-I like her.
-Why?

Why?

Well, unlike most ex-wives
I've known...

...she's never tried to run me over
with her car.

Okay, new dinner conversation.

Jake, how was school?

I don't think this conversation'll
make you any happier, Dad.

-What now?
-We had a surprise test today.

-And?
-I was really surprised.

So, in other words,
you weren't prepared.

You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad.

New conversation?

Jake, what are we gonna do?
You've really fallen behind this year.

I know. I think it's a delayed reaction
to your divorce.

-Oh?
-Yeah.

It took a while, but my teachers have
finally stopped feeling sorry for me.

You know, I'm a child of divorce too,
Jake.

Really? How old were you
when your parents split up?

-Twenty-two.
-But you're 22 now.

Twenty-two and a half.

Boy, what I'd give to be 22 again.

New subject?

No, no, no more conversation. Jake,
if you're finished, go do your homework.

I'm gonna need help.

-You don't need help, you need to focus.
-I'll help you.

Do you know anything
about geometry?

Well, I know it's what you say
when you turn into a tree.

Get it? Gee, I'm a tree.

Good one.

Thanks.

Boy, I hope when they get to Oz
the wizard has two brains to give out.

And speaking of out,
when's Kandi leaving?

-You don't have to worry.
-Because?

I have a plan.

Alan, if history has taught
us anything...

...it's that both those statements
cannot be true.

It's very simple.
You give a man a fish, he eats for a day.

You teach him to fish,
he eats forever.

Okay, okay, in that example
is Kandi the man or the fish?

I found her a job.

She'll be able to afford her own place
and she won't depend on me anymore.

Where is she working?

-She's gonna be my receptionist.
-That's your plan?

Why it's brilliant.

What, what?
She's attractive, she's friendly...

...and she's more than capable
of answering the phones.

You hear the expression
"don't crap where you eat"?

Well, you, my friend, are dropping
plunkies all over the dessert cart.

-Okay, you have a better solution?
-No, no, no.

No, it's your girlfriend,
your office, your life.

Screw it up however you think best.

I'll get it. I'm expecting a call.

Hello?

Kandi, that's the TV remote.

Hello?

Hello?

Have you thought of teaching
a fish to answer your phones?

Hello?

-Staying in tonight?
-Y ep.

-Giving up on the ladies, huh?
-Y ep.

-Not even gonna try?
-Nope.

You know, I got a niece in the joint.

She doesn't look like much,
but she does get conjugal visits.

I don't think so.

Hold on, I might have a copy
of her mug shot. Here.

She looks a little wall-eyed...

...but that's because they had to
use a Taser to get her out of the shed.

-The shed?
-She was running a meth lab.

But you gotta admit,
she is nice and slender.

-Thanks, but pass.
-Think about it.

Visiting days
are Wednesdays and Fridays.

But if you decide to go,
be a sport, take her a pie.

-Right.
-Make it something chewy.

The prison dentist set her up
with some real nice teeth.

Okay.

Now this isn't my lamp.

What happened to my lamp?

Unless this is my lamp.

Yeah, this is my lamp.

I bought this lamp to go
with my couch.

My tan couch.

Worst day of my life.

Yeah, well, it was no picnic
for me either.

-I don't know who you are anymore.
-You wanna know who I am?

I'm the idiot paying you $1 0 an hour to
miss phone calls. Nap in the bathroom.

Use my x-ray machine
on Mexican food.

Well, I wanted to know
what's inside a chimichanga.

If you didn't know,
why'd you order it?

Because it's fun to say chimichanga.

Chimichanga. See?

So, how was work?

Horrible.
All he did was boss me around:

"Do this, do that, wake up. "

Maybe that's because I'm your boss.

A stupid, stinky boss.

Anybody wanna know
about my problems?

It was supposed
to be Sloppy Joes for lunch.

But instead they had fish sticks.

Well, it ruined my day.

No, no, no, I'll get it.
That's what I do.

That's all I'm good for.

Hello? Oh, fudge.

Picture an entire day of this.

With six lines.

Hello?

Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper.

Oh, great. Kandi, Kandi,
give me the phone, give me--

Back off buck-o.

Was your ex-husband
always such a control freak?

She says you were.

You know what he did today?

Kandi, you don't have
to get into that with her.

She says she wants to know.

Well, first of all at the office he tried
to make me call him Dr. Harper all day.

And when I forgot he yelled at me.

What?

Chiropractors aren't really doctors.

You liar.

I so get why you dumped him.

-Hey, Alan?
-What?

Is this a new lamp?

I would like that so much,
Mrs. Harper.

Okay, I will call you Judith.
Great, I'll see you there.

See her where?

We're going out for a drink
and a little girl talk.

Girl talk with my ex-wife?

Her name is Judith,
Mr. "I'm not a doctor" Harper.

Don't wait up.

You just crapped
where you used to eat.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-What are you doing up so late?
-What time is it?

It's 3 a.m.

Oh, well then, I got my eight hours.

What are you doing,
waiting up for Kandi?

Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't sleep.

So I thought I'd read a little.

A furniture catalog?

I like furniture.

-Just looking at the pictures, huh?
-What are you getting at, Charlie?

I think you buy things.

I think you bought this lamp.

-That lamp was here when I moved in.
-Oh, really?

Charlie, I'm afraid that this dry streak
is starting to affect your mind.

Maybe you're right.

Sure, this is my lamp.
I've had it for years.

-The table it's on is new.
-I knew it.

We don't wanna wake up
Mr. Alan Hitler.

No, no, Osama bin Alan.

-Busted.
-What the hell is going on here?

The hell what is going on here...

...is that I need an advance
on my "amilony. "

-Why?
-T o pay Estefan, our limo driver.

You took a limo?

We couldn't find our cars...

...and we spent all our money
on JELL-O shots, and chimichangas.

All right, all right.

Kandi, you need to go to bed.
We have to get up early for work.

No, we don't. Because I quit.

Why don't we talk
about this in the morning?

All right, Judith,
here is you're "amilony. "

-Thank you.
-Go home.

And Kandi, go to bed.

I do not wish to live with you
any furthermore.

-What?
-I have been invited...

...to stay with my good friend Judith.

Come on, I'll help you
pack your things.

Did you ever notice how much
he sweats during sex?

Well, good for you.

Good for me?
How is this good for me?

-You got Kandi out of the house.
-I didn't want Kandi out.

And I didn't want her
moving in with my ex-wife.

Oh, right.

Okay then, good for me.

-Harper?
-Here.

I'm gonna have to check your pie.

Rhubarb.

Oh, my girls like rhubarb.

Okay, inmate 37059.
Down the hall, third door on the left.

There's a button by the bed.
Push it if she gets violent.

Thank you.

-lt won't open.
-Try it again.

Boy, you really are
having a dry streak, aren't you?

Oh, God.

I can't even get laid
in a women's prison.

-Hi, are you Alan?
-No, I'm his brother, Charlie.

Oh, well, I'm looking for Kandi.

She told me she was living here.

Actually, she moved.
It's a very funny story.

-Are you a friend?
-I'm her mother.

Come on in and I'll see if I can find
a forwarding address.

Thank you.

Chimichanga.

-Beautiful place.
-Thank you.

I see where Kandi
gets her good looks.

Thanks, unfortunately she gets
her brains from her moron father.

Oh, right, you're recently divorced.
Would you like a drink?

I would love one.

Great. Why don't you step out
on to the deck, and I'll be right there.

Good news,
it's raining out on my deck.

Say what?

The dry streak is over.

So, what am I supposed to do
with this pie?

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, what are you doing home
in the middle of the afternoon?

Look outside.

I guess the day got away from me.

-So you still depressed?
-What do you think?

By the looks of things...

...I'd say you're one sad song away
from deep-throating a shotgun.

Be a pal and put down a tarp first.

How did my life get to this point,
Charlie?

How does how does a man
sink this low?

Well, in all fairness,
you had a running start.

Sorry, sorry. Go on.

Things were going so well.

I had a young, hot girlfriend
who fulfilled all my sexual desires.

-How many desires are we talking about?
-Just the one. You know...

...for sex.

But now she's gone.

Buddy, she's not really gone.

You know where she is.

Yeah.

And where is that, Alan?

Why are you doing this?

Say it, Alan. The healing begins
when you can say it out loud.

My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife.

You know, I was wrong.

It's not the healing that begins
when you say it out loud...

...it's the laughter.

Nice talking to you.

Wait, wait, wait.

Hold on. Don't you wanna hear
how I can help you with all this?

I'm not going back to Tijuana
for another X-rated performance...

...of The Bride and the Burro.

Okay. First of all,
that's not what I was gonna suggest.

But if you recall, that trip
got you through a particularly dark...

...depressing part of your divorce.

The first time you smiled in months
was when you caught the bouquet.

All right,
against my better judgment...

...I'm gonna go and ask.
How do you propose to help me?

Well, first let's make sure
that we agree on the problem.

-Your ex-wife befriended your girlfriend.
-Yes.

And your girlfriend has moved in
with your ex-wife.

Yes.

Your ex-wife is turning
your girlfriend against you.

Do we have to go through this?

Just until it stops being funny.

Anyway, it would seem to me
the simple solution is to find someone...

...to speak to Kandi on your behalf.
Someone she trusts.

Yes, that would be great.
Now, what's your point?

Charlie?

If you're not coming back...

...at least tell me
where you keep the fresh batteries.

I'll be right up.

And it's rechargeable.

My point is,
I'm banging Kandi's mom.

What?

You're welcome.

Who is it?

You know damn well who it is.

I'm entertaining.

Not as much as you seem to think.

Hang on.

No, not you. You let go.

Come on in, Alan.

-Are you decent?
-He's above average.

Just come in.

Come on.

Oh, he's cute.
I can see why Kandi likes him.

Used to like him.

Oh yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
Come, sit. Let's talk about it.

Are you sure I'm not interrupting?

Don't worry about it.

Kind of hit
the seventh-inning stretch anyway.

You can go two more innings?

Even if I have to start throwing
knuckle balls.

Sit down.

Okay.

So you're Kandi's mom, huh?

-Mandi.
-Alan.

Some grip, huh?

Well, Mandi, I can see where--

Where your daughter
gets her good looks from.

Thank you. You know,
a lot of people think we're sisters.

Oh, there's a mental picture that'll get
me through the last two innings.

-Don't be naughty.
-Why, are you gonna spank me?

-I just might.
-I just might let you.

I just might go hang myself.

Oh, relax.

Oh, Kandi said he was a little shy.

First time they had sex,
he didn't take his shirt off.

Excuse me, that wasn't shyness.

The first time I had sex with your
daughter, I barely got my pants off.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, boundaries.
This is Kandi's mom.

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to create an awkward moment.

But enough about me.

How is it that you two are....

I mean, you know...

...how did you exactly--?

What the hell is going on here?

Good question, and a great story.

Mandi showed up here
looking for Kandi.

That's not a great story.

Sure it is. It's already had like
half a dozen happy endings.

You are definitely going over my knee.

Alan, we gotta wrap it up here.

But you said
you'd help me with Kandi.

I didn't say now.

-Do you want me to talk to her?
-I would really appreciate it.

Excuse me, but the pitcher's all
warmed up and ready to take the mound.

Of course,
I'm kind of busy at the moment.

Got it.

Oh, charge!

-Hey, Dad. Mom, Dad's here.
-Hey.

No, don't, don't bother your mom.
Is Kandi around?

-Yeah, she lives here now.
-I know.

Does this mean she and Mom are gay?

-No, it does not.
-Too bad.

-Why?
-Be a lot easier to explain.

-Could you just tell Kandi I'm here?
-Okay. Kandi, my dad's here.

-What do you want, Alan?
-I wanna talk to Kandi.

-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Why?

She's a sweet, innocent girl.
I don't want you to ruin her life too.

-Too? How did I ruin your life?
-You stole my youth.

You took my house.

That seems like a fair trade.

Face it. This escapade with Kandi
is just a pathetic attempt...

...to find a younger version of me.

Are you kidding?
Judith, I had a younger version of you...

...and let me tell you,
it was no great shakes.

It's okay, Judith. I'll talk to him.

He doesn't want to talk to you. There's
only one thing a man is interested in.

What?

Forget it. I'm here if you need me.

Hello, Alan.

Listen, Kandi,
I'm really sorry about our fight.

I know I can be a little bit
of a control freak and--

But I honestly care for you...

...and I hope you'll give me
another chance.

I see. Excuse me.

I can't let you steal my youth.

You're not fooling anybody, Judith.

Come on, Kandi,
tell me what you think.

Okay. I think we've reached
an implants in our relationship.

Impasse.

I think we've reached an impasse
in our relationship. Goodbye.

Excuse me,
is this Judith Harper's house?

Yeah. She traded it for her youth.

-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetheart.

Come on in.
Judith can't wait to meet you.

I can't wait to meet her.

I know you two
are gonna love each other.

I watch one donkey sex show...

...and you make me pay for it
the rest of my life.

Who is it?

Don't screw with me, Charlie.
We need to talk.

Give me a sec.

Charlie, you're just making it tighter.

Oh, the hell with it. Come on in, Alan.

-Hey there.
-Hiya.

-You know, I can come back.
-It's okay, Alan. Come, sit.

All right.

So how did it go with Kandi?

If it had gone well...

...do you think I'd be sitting here
talking to two half-naked people?

-Alan?
-What?

I'm completely naked.

What happened, Alan?

Well, as I suspected, Judith has turned
your daughter against me.

Well, I'm not surprised.
Kandi's always been very suggestible.

You know, until she was 8
she thought this was her nose.

That's kind of cute.

When Alan was 8, I convinced him
he only had two weeks to live.

But I suppose that tells you more
about me than him.

Yeah, good times.

But back to recent events--

Remember when I told you the cat-litter
box was filled with Almond Roca?

He ate four of them.

Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's
Museum of Sibling Cruelty?

I have something to talk about.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was interrupting you.

Go ahead, Alan.

Thank you.

So as I was leaving
my ex-wife's house...

...I ran into your ex-husband.

-Andy?
-I guess.

Wait a second.
It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi?

What's your point?

No point.

Mandi, Andy, Kandi.

Dandy.

Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set
my ex-wife up on a blind date with him.

How nice.

Nice? How is that nice?

Well, he's been kind of depressed
since we broke up.

It's good to see
he's getting back on the horse.

But that horse is my ex-wife.

Speaking of which, did you ever see
The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana?

See it? I caught the bouquet.

So did Alan.

Always a bridesmaid, never a burro.

Charlie,
l' m starting to lose feeling in my arm.

Oh, l' m sorry.

Hey, you went pretty far in the scouts.
Can you undo this knot?

Gee, actually,
I specialized in lndian lore.

Beaded belts, arrowheads.
But, good luck though.

Maybe you should go get
a pair of scissors.

Hang on, let me untie my feet.

We really didn't think this through,
did we?

So has your mom
been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad?

That's right. If she married him,
Kandi would be your stepsister.

Hey, hey, hey, do you happen to know
if they're going out tonight?

Yep, if I married Kandi,
she would be your stepmother.

But--

But tonight--
Is your mom going out tonight?

Yeah, yeah, I get it. If Kandi
took a poop, it would be your step-stool.

All right, well...

...it's always good to talk to you.

Love you, buddy.

Did you get all that, Berta?

I think so, but let's do a quick recap.

Your girlfriend's
living with your ex-wife.

Your ex-wife's
dating your girlfriend's father.

To top it off,
you're trying to get useful intelligence...

...from a kid who's got
precious little to spare.

Okay, just checking.

Hey, Berta.

-I want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta.
-Hi.

Listen...

...we got a pair of scissors handy?

Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie.

Why didn't you use
one of the poly blends?

Hey, hey, wait a minute, that's my tie.
You ruined my tie.

Oh, yeah.

You're not gonna be happy
about your electric toothbrush either.

Kandi's told me
so many nice things about you.

How do you know Kandi?

-She's my daughter.
-Your daughter?

Sweet whistling Geronimo.

You people are like a box of hamsters,
just crawling all over each other.

Yes, yes.

-We all get how this looks, Berta.
-Hey, I'm not knocking it.

I'm just wondering when some of that
gravy's gonna spill over on my taters.

Hey, what's up?

What's up? What are you doing here?

Well, Mandi came over
to put in a good word for you...

...and I figured I'd tag along for grins.

Here comes one now.

Come on in.

I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

Sit down. Make yourself at home.

Thanks...

...I will.

-Where's-- Where's Jake?
-He's at a sleepover.

Hi, Alan.

How are you?

About two heartbeats
from a brain aneurysm.

Where's Kandi?

She's in her room.
But I thought we should talk first.

We just have a few questions.

About what?

Charlie?

Well, Kandi's mom and I are
a little concerned about your intentions.

You should be...

...because I intend to kill you.

That's the kind of attitude...

...that isn't gonna win you
a lot of friends around here, mister.

Alan, you're a very sweet man.

But let's face facts.

Kandi has her whole life ahead of her,
while you...

...not so much.

-Kandi?
-Alan?

-I am so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

Oh, isn't that sweet?

-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too, huggy bear.

Mom, I'm gonna go have sex with Alan,
okay?

You kids have fun.

-Hold on there, young man.
-What?

Don't be a selfish lover.
Consider her needs.

This isn't over.

You're right.
He is easy to screw with.

Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca.
Even the cat was laughing at him.

So should we head back to my place?

I suppose.

What's wrong?

Nothing. It's just...

...we've already had sex there.

Oh, baby. I really, really like you.

Well, thank you, Judith.
I had a wonderful evening.

I hope we can do it again some--

Maybe catch a movie.

Or go for a hike.

I'm guessing that's your ex-husband.

-Good-looking man.
-Oh, he's gorgeous.

Dumb as wood.

Oh, my Lord.

But it's good wood.

-I better find Alan so we can get out.
-You wanna leave? This is so hot.

Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better
and better.

-Hang on while I give Alan a heads up.
-Hurry back and give me one.

Alan?

Alan?

You're the most beautiful man
I've ever seen.

Not Alan.

Couldn't find him.

Mandi.

Mandi.

You know what else I like?
Swap meets.

-Swell.
-Yeah.

Your ex-husband
must be a real little guy, huh?

Forget about him.
Let's get some wine in you.

Mandi.

Glasses are in there.

No, no, top shelf.

That's what I'm talking about.

Hey, you ever go rock climbing?
It's a great workout.

Mandi?

Mandi.

Alan?

-Anybody?
-Over here.

Damn it.

-What are you doing?
-I was thirsty.

-Have you seen Alan?
-I've been in the closet.

So where the hell is he?

Oh, my, I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

I haven't been with another woman
in a long time.

Yeah, yeah, take off your robe.

Okay.

Hot damn.

Yeah, it is hot.

-Hi, Daddy.
-Hey, Judith.

Daddy,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Alan.

-Nice to see you again.
-Small world.

-I said I was sorry.
-Just get out.

I'll give you a call, Judith.
Maybe we'll hit some garage sales.

Yeah, terrific.

I like your daughter.

I like your ex-wife.

Wanna get a drink?

I'm not doing anything.

Do you like garage sales?

Where am I supposed to go?

I don't care. Just leave.

But I thought we were friends.

Friends don't have sex with their friends'
ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub.

Divorced three years
and he's still ruining my life.

Should have drowned his stupid ass.

-Did you hear something?
-Nope.

-How's the head?
-Let's find out.

.......... ********** ..........

Alan, do you ever fantasize
when we're making love?

Well, occasionally I pretend
that I'm better looking.

What about you?

Sometimes I imagine we're
in the middle of a big department store.

Having sex?

No, shopping.

Why would I fantasize about having sex
while I'm having sex?

Do you think about ham and cheese
when you're eating a sandwich?

Can't argue with that.

What you thinking?

Nothing really. I just--
I got a call from Jake's school today.

You know who called me?
Jessica Murray.

Oh, who's that?

A friend of mine.

Yeah, well....

Anyway, Jake's mom and I have to go to
a parent-teacher conference tomorrow...

...and I don't really know
what it's about.

Hey, do you ever pretend
your toes are little people?

What? No.

Sometimes I make believe they're
different families playing Family Feud.

All right, let's meet our champions.

He goes to market, she stays home,
please welcome the Piggy family.

Hi, everybody.

You' re going down Piggy family.
You're going down.

-Hey.
-Hey.

He's shooting 51 percent
from beyond the arc. That's pretty good.

How's it going?

Forget it, Alan.

I only do the après-sex chat
with people I've just had sex with.

Come on. She's playing
Family Feud with her toes.

I don't care if she's playing banjo
with her nipples.

I need to communicate
after lovemaking. I need to share.

You should have thought of that
before boinking a girl...

...with the lQ of Tickle Me Elmo.

Fine.

Hey, Berta. How's it going?

Back off, zippy.

You want pillow talk,
you gotta spoon me first.

I suppose I could talk about
his grades again...

...but I think we all agree
that ship has pretty much sailed.

So why did you wanna see us?

Well, I'm concerned
that even outside of the classroom...

...Jake has no interest in anything
that goes on around here.

Now, hang on. He speaks very highly
of your hot lunch program.

Well, I was talking more about hobbies
or extracurricular activities.

Well, I don't know about his father...

...but I've tried to share
some of my interests with him.

Unfortunately, he's a little young
to drink in the dark and bitch about men.

You know...

...I was kind of lacking in focus
when I was his age too...

...till I got bit by the old theater bug.

Too bad you didn't get bit
by the old rabid squirrel.

You know, I'm organizing
a drama club.

Would that be something
Jake would have any interest in...

...or do you think he gets
enough drama at home?

All the world's a stage.

And we are merely players.

Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

She say what I'm in trouble for?

Nope.

Boy, it's the not knowing
that drives you crazy.

Yeah, like a pregnancy test.

Yeah.

I don't get it.

Yes. In your face, Opie.

This game stinks.

No, you stink at it.

That was my lunch money.

Oh, your lunch money,
why didn't you tell me?

Boo-freaking-hoo. Pack a sandwich.

Okay, Jake, well, we talked
to Miss Sheffield.

I'm sorry.

-What are you sorry about?
-I'm....

I'm sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead.

It would be a good idea if you got
involved in extracurricular activities.

Oh, okay.

Great, great.
We'll talk about it at home.

Do you know
what an "extracurricular activity" is?

Who cares? I'm off the hook.

-What do you think?
-What was this all about?

-It's choreography.
-It's gay.

Okay.
Forget about the movements.

-Just try singing the song.
-No.

-Why not?
-Because it's gay.

Don't encourage him.

Don't make him sing
Gilbert and Sullivan.

He needs something to audition for the
school musical. You teach him a song.

-Why don't you let him choose?
-Jake.

-Tell you uncle what you wanted to sing.
-It's called "Whup That Stanky Ho. "

All right. There's gotta be
some middle ground here.

-You like classic rock, right?
-Yeah.

Okay, well, pick a band.

How about Queen?

Oh, good. I was afraid
he was gonna pick something gay.

Doesn't sound right.

You heard it too, huh?

-You sure you played all the right notes?
-Y es, I'm sure.

It doesn't sound anything like
Queen's version.

No, it doesn't.

Why don't you work on it.
We'll try again tomorrow.

Yeah, why don't I do that.

The kid's a double threat:

tone-deaf and arrogant.

-Hey.
-Where have you been?

Kandi called for you.

Oh, I had to work late.

Yeah, one of my regular patients
had a crisis.

His name is Roger, he had
a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve.

-T oo bad.
-Nice guy, you'd like him.

He restores old cars. Well, it's
actually more a hobby than a job.

He works at Staples.
His name is Roger.

-Alan.
-Yeah?

Why are you lying to me?

I don't know. I really suck at it.

You do indeed.

Don't you care where I was?

Why would I start now?

Oh, come on, I really need to get this
off my chest.

All right, go ahead.

-I was with another woman.
-Okay, okay, see, that's a good lie.

No, no. I really was
with another woman.

Seriously?

You're already doing a hot 22-year-old
and you're cheating on her?

Yes.

I am so proud of you.

-What?
-Who's the dog? My brother's the dog.

Come on, dog. Come on, dog.
Howl with me.

No, stop howling and let me explain.

There's nothing to explain.

You're sleeping with two women
at the same time. You're a big old dog.

No, I haven't been sleeping
with the other woman.

I've been seeing Jake's teacher.

All we do is talk.

I don't know how to explain it.
We have so much in common.

I mean, she's divorced.
She has a kid Jake's age.

She reads. She likes the theater.

Yeah, yeah. But you're not
sleeping with her?

-Why would I when I've got Kandi?
-I don't know. Because you can?

It's not that kind of a relationship.
It's intellectual.

So take her to a museum, enjoy
the exhibits and do her in the restroom.

-You're missing the point.
-No, you're missing the point.

Not getting laid, it's not cheating.

-Then why do I feel so guilty?
-That's easy. Because you're an idiot.

I guess I always thought that one woman
was supposed to fulfill all my needs.

Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

Started to protect the interests of,
you guessed it, old wives.

So you're saying the whole concept
of monogamy is a fraud.

-The institution of marriage is a sham?
-No, no, no.

I'm just saying, bang the teacher.

Why does he make everything
so complicated?

Here we go.

"Blunderbuss. "

Very elegant use of my "under. "

Thank you.

Boy. I have more vowels
than a Honolulu phone book.

You're so clever, Alan.

Thank you. You am smart too.

-Hey, Alan, can I talk to you for a sec?
-Sure. Excuse me.

Hurry back.

What's up?

-You tell me.
-Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble.

And you're right.

-There's nothing to feel guilty about.
-Good to know. Because Kandi's here.

Oh, okay.

It's not a problem.
Here's what we do.

-We?
-Come on, work with me.

You go cover for me with Kandi
and I'll get Francine the hell out of here.

But there was nothing
to feel guilty about.

You know that and I know that,
now go lie to Kandi about it.

Fine, I'll tell her you went to Staples
to see Roger.

Who?

-Hey, why don't we walk on the beach.
-What about the game?

Screw the game, I concede.
You win, well-played.

All right.

It is a beautiful night.

Yeah, yeah. Let's go enjoy it
on the beach. Chop-chop.

-Kandi?
-What?

Alan must have slipped out.

-You're lying to me, Charlie.
-No, I'm not.

Oh, okay.

Wait, wait. Don't you wanna know
where he is?

-Where who is?
-Alan.

Sure, why not.

All right. The truth is...

...Alan is out trying to find
the perfect gift for you.

-Really?
-Yes.

He wants to surprise you
with something extremely expensive.

Can you give me a hint?

Well, let's see.

It's something
that's a girl's best friend...

...and looks good
wrapped around their neck.

I'm getting a monkey?

No, no. Sweet Lord.

A diamond necklace.

That's nice too.

Just remember,
you didn't hear it from me.

Then who did I hear it from?

Nobody.

When he gives it to you,
act surprised.

Don't worry, I'll be really surprised.

Good. Good. Good.

So will he.

That's-- That's-- That's terrific.

-Do you wanna hear it again?
-No.

We don't want you
to strain your voice.

Do you think I'm gonna do okay
at the audition?

-You never know how these things go.
-Yeah.

Just hope I have
a decent piano player.

I thought you were working with him.
What's the problem?

Okay, there's a technical term
we musicians use.

Jake stinks.

Well, is there anything we can do?

We can hope "stinks"
suddenly becomes popular.

But I wouldn't count on it.

Oh, by the way, you need
to buy Kandi a diamond necklace.

What?

You told me to cover.
I said you were out buying her jewelry.

That's all you could think of?

Well, I could think of a lot of things
but only one made me laugh.

I can't afford to buy her jewelry.

I know.

That's what makes it funny.

Must have been so expensive.

Yeah.

You do realize this entitles you
to extra-special bonus sex.

What is extra-special bonus sex?

It's whatever you want it to be.

That sounds like fun.

Go away.

Okay, I'll just play Scrabble
till you're ready.

Give me a sec.

Please don't tell me Francine is here.

Okay.

Wait, wait, wait.

Francine is here?

-Yeah, you want me to cover for you?
-Yes.

I'm on it.

Wait. Charlie, I'm begging you.

No more jewelry.

Don't worry. It's not funny twice.

Sorry, he must have gone out.

Oh, okay. Tell him I stopped by.

Francine, wait.

I can't do this.

Do what?

I'm not a good liar.

I know where he is,
I'm just not supposed to tell you.

The thing is, Alan does
a lot of charity work.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

Right now he's down
at the nursing home...

...giving sponge baths to old people.

They don't go out a lot
so they tend to get dusty.

I had no idea.

In fact, just the other night
he was down on skid row...

...teaching salsa dancing
to crack addicts.

Oh, my goodness.

They have the energy,
they just lack the focus.

But I think-- I think what he's
proudest of is his work with the kids.

He takes runaways forced to live
on the streets...

...and teaches them how to live
in the woods.

I don't really see the point but those
little urchins seem to thrive in the wild.

It's like he's a saint.

You must be so proud to have him
as your brother.

Well, truth be told,
he does bring me a lot of joy.

Thank you for telling me this, Charlie.

You're welcome.

Just promise you won't
embarrass him bringing it up.

Not a word.
I just hope I can be worthy of him.

And the plot moistens.

Oh, that's terrific, buddy.
I am so proud of you.

Yeah, sure, I'll tell him.

Oh, all right. Love you. Bye-bye.

Guess what.

Jake just got the lead
in the school musical.

The lead?

What happened, did every other kid
in school get mono?

No, I think it was Francine.

I think she cast Jake
because of our relationship.

You mean it's gotten physical?
You're sleeping his way to the top?

No, no.
Nothing happened between us.

-But I think she's fallen for me.
-Really?

What makes you think that?

Well, I had lunch with her today
and she was looking at me with...

...I don't know...

...worship in her eyes.

Like I was some kind of--

-Saint?
-Yes, yes.

How did you know?

That's how I think of you.

Very funny. I've been
doing my best not to lead her on...

...but I guess I just underestimated
my allure.

Say that again.

-What?
-That last part.

You mean,
I underestimated my allure?

Yeah, that's it.

I'm sorry, am I missing something?

No, not a thing.

Well, good.

You see, Alan. That's how you lie.

Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night.

Well, having seen the previews,
I'm betting closing night too.

Boy, this brings back memories.

Sixth grade was the happiest
two years of my life.

It's the finger.

Excuse me.

So, Kandi, what's your
favorite musical?

The trombone.

I can't believe you brought her here.

I had to, Jake invited her.

Is that a diamond necklace?
You never gave me a diamond necklace.

Y eah, well, you never gave me
extra-special bonus sex.

-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

-Who's this?
-This? Oh, this is Kandi.

Hi, I'm with Alan.

Are you one of those young people
he takes care of?

Yep, yep, yep. Good old Saint Alan.
Just can't do enough for the kids.

Look at this diamond necklace
he gave me.

He gave you a diamond necklace?

Don't get the wrong idea,
it wasn't to get me to have sex.

I was already doing
everything he wanted.

I am as shocked as you are.

What was that about?

Funny story. I'll tell you later.

.......... ********** ..........

-Morning.
-Morning.

Yeah, what's up?

Oh, stop it.

-Hey. Give me back my skully.
-This is not a skully.

It's a ski cap your grandmother
gave you for Christmas.

-Charlie, he's just trying to find his look.
-Word.

Word?

There's a reindeer on it.

Don't listen to him, Jake.
I think it looks very dope on you.

Oh, man.

Oh, hey, did you see that your former
girlfriend's dance troupe is in town?

Mia's here? Let me see that.
Come on, come on, come on.

Whoa, is somebody
still carrying a torch?

T orch? Don't be ridiculous.

I mean, I'm glad to see she's following
her dream but I've moved on.

-I think she called the other day.
-What? When?

What did she want?
What did she say?

Come on, kid, spill it.

Nope, no unresolved feelings there.

She wanted to talk to you
but you weren't home.

I know that, you chowderhead.
What else did she say?

She said, "What's new? "
I said, "Nothing much. "

And then she said, "How's school? "
I said, "lt sucks. "

Then she said, "That's too bad. "
I said, "Yeah. "

I'm gonna kill him, Alan.
I swear to God I'm gonna kill him.

Oh, yeah, she wants us
to come see her dance next weekend.

It says she's performing this weekend.

Oh, I guess she called last weekend.

-You're telling me this now?
-Charlie. Calm down.

How many things
does the kid have to handle?

Eat, poop, tell me who called.

She said some guy named Will
has tickets.

-Who's Will?
-I don't know. She said he'd call.

Will's gonna call?

-You mean the tickets are at will call?
-I don't know. Maybe.

Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats.

Do me a favor. From now on,
when somebody calls, write it down.

-I did.
-Where?

-On my homework.
-Okay, where's your homework?

Oh yeah, my teacher called.
She wants to meet with you.

When?

Oh, I guess it was last week.

Peace out.

Great. Great. Thank you.

Mia left us four seats for Friday night.
House seats, center orchestra.

What do you think? You, me, Jake, Kandi,
go out to dinner, make an evening of it?

Sounds like fun.

Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an
anthill, and smear honey on my genitals.

So you don't wanna go?

Jeez, now I see where
the kid gets his brains.

No, I don't wanna go.
Why would I wanna go?

Because you were in love
with the woman...

...and still have feelings for her
and wanna see her.

Oh, that's crazy.
God, you are so naive.

-How am I naive?
-Oh, oh, I know this one.

Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls,
no good can come from it.

Unless, you know,
it's 2 a.m., she's blind drunk...

...and wants to get even
with her new cheating boyfriend.

She just wanted to invite us
to the ballet.

Yeah, right.
And girls are completely unaware...

...that you can see their nipples
through their shirts.

What does that have to--?
Really, they know?

There's only a few reasons
why an ex calls.

One, they're great,
and wanna rub your nose in it.

Or two, they're doing lousy
and need to borrow money.

Three, they got money
from knocking over a Laundromat...

...and wanna hide it under your trailer
until the heat's off.

It happens.

Okay, okay, how about four?
She misses you, and wants to try again?

What is it she's gonna try?

T o change me into something I'm not?

T o get me to stop drinking,
smoking, gambling?

To rescue me from the barren,
loveless abyss my life has become?

What?

You know what I think?

You were never happier
than when you were with Mia.

You still have feelings for her.
You're afraid to admit it.

You are so wrong.
You couldn't be more wrong.

-You believe that guy?
-You want the truth?

-No, probably not.
-Good call.

Oh, by the way,
here's the 20 bucks I owe you.

I am telling you, it is not appropriate
to wear to the ballet.

Why you tripping on me?

Hey, Alan. Matey.

-I'm not a pirate.
-You're not a gangsta either.

You're a dorky, white kid
with a Cub Scout bandana on his head.

Yo, hate the game,
don't hate the player.

You know kids better than me.
How long does this pimp stage last?

Just ignore him.

-You sure you won't come with us?
-Positive.

-Should I at least say hi to Mia for you?
-Say what you want.

-I'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's.
-Who?

How would I know?
I haven't met her yet.

Hi. Do I look okay?

-Perfect.
-Hey, no fair.

You grow a rack like that, you can
wear anything you want on your head.

You have a house on the beach?

I'd love to see it.

-I could take you there.
-Great.

Then I could bring you out
on my deck.

We could watch the surf
in the moonlight.

Then I could take you in my arms,
kiss you. Not a big kiss.

Just a little something that gives you
a taste of what's to come.

Well, let's go.

I'd take your hand
and lead you up to my bedroom...

...where I'd slowly undress you.

Then lay you down on the crisp,
cool sheets...

...and make wild, passionate love
to you until we're both totally spent.

Okay.

Then in the morning, I'll bring you
a cup of coffee and your car keys.

Wait, my car keys?

I'll promise to call you
but I never will.

And when you call me, you'll find
that the phone number I gave you...

...belongs to a dry cleaner
in Koreatown.

What?

When all is said and done,
you know what we'll both have?

Nothing.

Not even a good memory.

What do you say we do us both a favor
and not go through with this charade?

Okay.

Jeez, I was just trying to get laid.

See, Jake, the swan is dying.

Can you believe--?

Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Excuse me. Hey.

-What did I miss?
-I thought you weren't coming.

I'm not here for Mia.
I'm here to support the arts.

Yikes, look at the package
on that pretty dude.

Hey, good job.

Eat something.

-Charlie.
-Hey. You were terrific.

Thank you.

-I'm so glad you came.
-Are you kidding me?

I've been looking forward to this
all week.

-Dressed like that?
-Well, how else would you recognize me?

-These are for you.
-Thank you. They're beautiful.

No big deal, they had them
at the liquor store.

It was either this
or a stack of lotto scratchers.

-I think you made the wise choice.
-We'll never know, will we?

Alan would've come,
but he had to take the kids home.

-Kids?
-He's kind of adopted a young girl.

-Really?
-Well, not so much adopted as banging.

So you're looking good.

-You too. How have you been?
-Great. Just great. Really great.

-Good.
-No, no. No, great.

-And you, how have you been?
-Wonderful.

All right then, I'm great
and you're wonderful.

So what the hell are we doing here?

There was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

-Hey, Mia. Who's your cute friend?
-This is Charlie. Charlie, Theresa.

Hey.

So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

This really isn't the right place.

Why don't I get changed
and stop by your house?

Sure. I'll be up.

-Because, you know, I'm a night person.
-I remember.

Of course, if you come too late,
I could be drunk.

-I remember.
-There could be other women there.

I remember.

-See you later.
-Whatever.

Hey, can you unhook me?

What's going on?

Nothing.

Mia's coming over, so I thought l'd--

Nothing.

-I see.
-What do you mean you see?

You're right. It's too much.

-How's that?
-Well, l--

Right. She'll smell there were candles
burning, so I have to light at least one.

-What about the music?
-What about it?

You're right.
Sounds like I'm trying too hard.

-Better?
-Well, l--

You're right.

No music.

-Charlie?
-Yeah?

I'm just glad you're over her.

Get the door. Get the door.
Get the door.

-Hi, Alan.
-Hey, Mia, you were great tonight.

-Thanks. Did Jake like it?
-He was absolutely knocked out.

Charlie, Mia's here.

Oh, really?

-Well, ask her in.
-All right.

-Won't you come in?
-Okay.

Hi, Mia, I almost forgot
you were coming.

Get out.

-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

Sit down, make yourself at home.

Place looks the same.

Well, you know me,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

If it is broke, who gives a rat's ass?

-Can I get you a drink?
-No, I'm good.

-So am l. In fact, I'm great.
-Yeah, you mentioned that.

Repeatedly.

So, what did you wanna talk about?

Oh, boy.

This is a hard thing to ask.

You need some money.

What? No.

So, what? You wanna get back
together again?

Oh, God no.

All right, then, how about
a quickie for old times' sake?

Please.

Charlie...

...I think you're a terrific guy.

You're smart, you're handsome,
you're talented.

All good arguments for the quickie.

-Will you let me finish?
-Didn't I always?

Sorry. Sorry, go on.

I've been thinking a lot lately
about what I want out of life.

I love dancing, but let's face it,
I'm not getting any younger.

So the time has come
for me to make some tough choices.

-I understand completely.
-You do?

No, I'm just trying to be supportive.

Charlie, I came here because--

Well--

I want your sperm.

All right, where do you want it?

-Alan, Alan, wake up. Wake up.
-What?

Mia wants sperm.

Well, don't look at me.

No, no, she wants my sperm.

She wants me to make a deposit
so she can have a baby.

-You're kidding.
-Apparently, that's another of its uses.

What the hell is that?

I'm not sure. Near as I can tell,
she's chasing a rabbit.

So why did Mia come to you?

Well, it turns out
her biological clock is ticking.

Most of the guys she meets are
ballet dancers, so, slim pickings there.

She doesn't wanna wait
for Mr. Right to come along.

-Which pretty much leaves you.
-Yep.

I'm good genetic material,
you know, easy on the eyes.

And she wants to raise the kid alone
which fits nicely into my lifestyle.

Charlie, drinking, gambling
and casual sex is not a lifestyle.

Okay, okay, I didn't come in here
to argue with you.

Look in the hedges,
look in the hedges.

What?

I don't know.

So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go to a sperm bank?

Well, I tried to talk her into
a direct deposit.

You know, straight from the tap.

But she really dug in her heels.
And not in the good way.

-And you're okay with it?
-Well, why not?

I've sent billions of soldiers out there.

It's time for one of them
to finally take the hill.

-Now what?
-I think she caught the rabbit.

Anyway, I'm thinking
this could be my one chance...

...to guarantee
that the Charlie gene lives on.

You know, make sure
the double helix that is uniquely me...

...keeps on trucking into the future.

Okay, let's assume
that's a good thing.

-One more question.
-Yeah?

If you have no doubts,
why'd you wake me up to tell me?

Well, you're my brother...

...and I thought you should know
you're gonna be an uncle.

You mean, I'm gonna be an uncle
to a child I'll never see.

Tell you what, when he turns 1 2,
I'll track him down...

...bring him to live with you and we'll
see if you get your phone messages.

-What do you think?
-Looks like pretty standard boilerplate.

It says that once your swim team's
off the bus, you're no longer the coach.

All right. Let's see, where do I sign?

The old John Hancock, if you will.

You sure you want to?

You're giving up the rights
not only to your sperm...

...but to any children
that might result from them. It.

-I understand.
-Do you?

Once you sign, Mia can do whatever
she wants with it. Them.

She can use it, resell it, freeze it,
put it on eBay.

Hey, I don't care if she uses it
to caulk her bathtub.

Once the boys reach escape velocity,
they're on their own.

-I see.
-It's out of my hands, so to speak.

I got it.

Okay. I'll be back in two shakes.

Three, if it's cold in there.

Charlie? You okay?

-Charlie?
-What?

You've been in there a long time.
How's it going?

How do you think it's going?

Well, I don't know if this'll help,
but sometimes when I was married...

...I used to pretend I was having sex
with a completely different woman.

Oh, thanks. The image of you
bumping uglies with your ex-wife...

...should really move things along.

Excuse me, I was just trying to help.

Yeah, well, I was just trying
to have sex with a cup.

Don't think of it as a cup.
Think of it as a polyurethane lapdancer.

-Get out.
-I'm going.

-Hello?
-Charlie, I was just getting packed.

Oh, right, you're heading
to San Francisco.

That's gotta be a big ballet town.

Yeah.

So did you go to the sperm bank?

And?

Not a lot of laughs in that place.

I asked the receptionist
if she takes work home with her.

Nothing. Not even a smile.

Thanks for doing this.
You have no idea what it means to me.

Yeah, well, funny thing, turns out
it means something to me too.

-What are you talking about?
-I tried, Mia, I really did.

I tried the magazines, the movies.

You can't imagine
how bad porn acting is...

...until you actually watch more
than three, four minutes at a time.

So you're saying you couldn't? You?

Yeah, I know. What are the odds?

Well, I guess these things happen.
You'll try again. I'm sure you'll do fine.

I don't think so.

Why not?

I have thoughts about the reason...

...things didn't go down
as planned, or actually, up.

Okay, I'm listening.

As I was sitting
in that little sperm cubicle...

...watching Assmasters 7:
The Final Chapter...

...all I could think about was some kid
of mine growing up somewhere...

...and me not having a chance to,
you know, be a part of his life.

-I thought you were okay with that.
-I thought I was too.

But as it turns out, I'm not.

So if this is something
you really wanna do...

...then you're gonna have
to find someone else.

I see.

And by the way, Assmasters 7
is not the final chapter.

They left a lot of loose ends.

All right, well, I gotta go.

-I appreciate the effort.
-Oh, thanks.

I think I have a rotator cuff injury.

Good seeing you again, Charlie.

Good seeing you too.

-Hey, let me float another idea by you.
-What?

It's a little crazy, a little unorthodox.

If you really want a kid,
this could be the solution.

-Charlie, I am not having sex with you.
-Who said anything about having sex?

I'm asking you to marry me.

There's no Charlie here.

Why you stupid girls keep calling?

No, listen, I don't take message.
I do dry cleaning.

One more time,
there's no Charlie here.

.......... ********** ..........

Hello?

Anybody?

Big news.

I'm gonna marry Mia.

Hey, Alan.

I'm in the shower.

Guess what I'm gonna do
with Mia.

Guess what I'm already doing
with Kandi.

That's not fair, Alan.

You have to give him a hint.

He doesn't need a hint.

Well, then how's he supposed
to guess?

Oh, well.

Look, a place to hang my washcloth.

The rule of thumb
with an engagement ring...

...is that the price should equal
three months' salary.

I wonder what broad
came up with that.

It's a marketing scheme dreamed up
by the international diamond cartel.

Probably a bunch of chicks.

But at least diamonds are forever.

Oh, yeah, forever.
My ex-wife still has hers.

Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched
socks from the irregular bin.

Well, Mia and I are gonna go
the distance.

Fifteen, maybe 20 years.

That's not the distance.

The distance is death.

If I'm still married
after 20 years, kill me.

-I can't believe you're doing this at all.
-Why not?

Why shouldn't someone like me
settle down with a wife and kids?

Boy, I don't know where to start.

That's the old Charlie
you're thinking of.

Oh, okay.

And to whom am I speaking now?

-May I help you gentlemen?
-We're looking for an engagement ring.

How nice.

Do you have anything in mind?

Nothing ostentatious.

Something in a brilliant cut,
perhaps with complementary baguettes.

Size isn't as important
as color and clarity.

Well, someone knows what he wants.

What can I say?

He's my life.

So basically I asked her to marry me
and she said yes.

-What do you think about that, Jake?
-Good.

That's it? Good?

It's not good?

No, it's good.

That's what I said.

All right, I'm full.

Wears his little heart on his sleeve,
doesn't he?

It's my own fault.

I should've known better
than to talk to him at feeding time.

Charlie, I need to speak to you.

I'll be right out, Rose.

-Did you tell her?
-Of course not.

-Would you?
-No.

-I'll let you be my best man.
-You mean I'm not?

Well, you're on the short list
but this could cinch it.

Come on, that woman has been
obsessed with you for years.

She's gonna find out sooner or later.
Let it come from you.

Yeah, I guess.

She has a boyfriend now.
She probably won't care.

-Probably not.
-So why won't you tell her?

Because if I want my eyebrows shaved,
I'll shave them myself.

Hey, Rosey Rose.

What's up, Rosey Rose?

Gordon dumped me.

Oh, damn it to hell.

I know, it's awful.

How could he do this?

He couldn't be with me anymore
knowing that I'm still in love with you.

Oh, no, no, no.

Yes, yes, yes...

...yes, yes.

Listen, Rose.

-There's something I have to tell you.
-ls it good news?

I could use some good news.

Well...

-...you remember Mia?
-Yeah.

Don't tell me you're dating her again.

No, no. No, we are not dating.

Good. Because I always thought
she was kind of a head case.

Yeah.

Look, the thing is, I'm gonna,
kind of, marry her.

Rose?

-Did you hear me?
-I heard you.

You're gonna marry Mia.

So are you okay?

Sure.

Why wouldn't I be okay?

Well, I was afraid the news might come
as a bit of a shock to you.

Afraid?

There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie.

You're my friend.

Where are you going?

I have things to do.

-What kind of things?
-Things.

Goodbye, Charlie.

Hello, Alan.

Hello.

Did she just use the front door?

She's never used
the front door before.

What happened out there?

Well, I told her
I was gonna marry Mia...

...and I think I could actually see
her medication stop working.

-What do you think she's gonna do?
-The question isn't what, it's when.

And how I'm gonna enjoy my honeymoon
with my testicles glued to my ass-crack.

-That's a pretty wedding gown.
-Oh, yeah.

I could crawl under there
during the reception...

...and no one would have a clue.

Well, you would.

Stop.

I don't think you'd say that.

Isn't it beautiful?

They say you're supposed to spend
three months' salary but I went four.

-Because I'm worth it?
-No, actually I had a slow first quarter.

My dad called today. He wants to
take your family out for dinner.

Y eah, well, tell him he can have one
or the other but not both.

Come on, they're gonna have to
meet sooner or later.

Okay, but why don't we wait
for a real happy occasion?

-What's happier than a wedding?
-My mother's funeral springs to mind.

There'll be music, dancing,
my mom will be in a box.

You're horrible.

That's a gorgeous wedding cake.

It's okay.

I'm not big on having
the little action figures on top.

-They kind of creep me out.
-They're traditional.

Hey, this is our wedding,
we can do whatever we want.

We don't even have to have cake,
we could have pie.

A wedding pie?

Well, we'd probably need
more than one.

You know, so everybody gets
some crust.

Alan, what do you think
about a wedding with no cake?

No cake? Where would you put
the little bride and groom?

I can think of one place.

-lf you do a wedding, do it right.
-Thank you, Alan.

You're welcome. Which reminds me,
I found my wedding folder.

-Guess what was in it?
-The claim check for your manhood?

As I was saying...

...it's all here. Everything you could
possibly need for your big day.

From paper samples
for your announcements...

...to selected verses of poetry
well-suited for wedding vows.

And you wonder why people
think you're gay.

Oh, shush.

Now, you're talking cake
but we are light years away from cake.

First we have to discuss the budget,
the venue, how many guests.

Is it gonna be a sit-down dinner
or a buffet.

Then you need to hire a photographer
and a videographer. Then a florist.

Have you thought about flowers?

Well, lilies are nice.

Lilies are perfect if the bride and groom
are recently deceased.

But I like lilies.

Mia, we'll never get through this
if you don't focus.

Now, wedding party.

Bridesmaids. What are they wearing?

I suggest an unflattering style
in a hideous color...

...because after all, this is your day.

Oh, and before I forget, although
it's not politically correct to throw rice...

...if you throw birdseed, you run the risk
of ending like a Hitchcock movie.

What kind of pie
did you have in mind?

Well, look who's here.
The bride of Drunkenstein.

Look.

Wow, that's quite a rock.

You know what we call babes
with rings like that in my neighborhood?

Stumpy.

What are you looking at me for?
Just stay out of her neighborhood.

That was uncomfortable.

No, sand in my urethra
is uncomfortable.

That meal was a freaking disaster.

I'm gonna stay with my family,
try and calm my mother down.

The miserable bitch.

-Your family hates me, don't they?
-Not just you.

I'll call you later.

Do you believe your
future mother-in-law?

Shows up at a four-star restaurant
wearing a tracksuit...

...with the word "juicy" stretched across
her half-acre ass.

I can read, Mom.

Can we go back?
I forgot my doggy bag.

We can never go back, Jake.

Come on, it's not the end
of the world.

Easy for you to say. You're not marrying
into the Addams family.

Oh, like you were a prize.

Slipping a prenuptial agreement
into my fiancée's menu.

I am just trying to protect you...

...from being wiped out
by a vindictive ex-wife...

...who will use your hard-earned money
to finance a frivolous life of partying...

...and shopping
and unnecessary plastic surgery.

-Mom--
-Every one of my surgeries...

...was necessary.

And if I had signed a pre-nup...

...you would never have gone
to music camp...

...and Alan would have an overbite
you could use to open a can of Pennzoil.

I didn't know Mia's last name
was Addams.

I didn't know her sister is a cop.

Was a cop.

Now she's a dry drunk
with a grudge and a.38.

Well, I liked her.

Well, that's because she had
the same haircut as you.

I was a little shocked that her father
stuck you with the bill.

You know why you noticed that?

Because the two of you
trampled each other...

...trying to get to the men's room
when you saw the waiter bringing it.

I drank a lot of iced tea.

Well, I had a very nice time.

Sure, you got to inform my bride-to-be
and her entire family...

...that you had sex with me
before you had sex with him.

I was just telling Mia
I know how lucky she is.

Nevertheless, honey,
it was not an appropriate toast.

Juicy-pants almost choked to death
on her lamb shank.

Well, in all fairness, the woman was
stuffing her face like a musket.

All I can say is,
after tonight's fiasco...

...I'm gonna have to rethink
the seating chart for the wedding.

Yeah, well, it won't be
that complicated.

-Why not?
-Because none of you are invited.

Well, Mom, if you wear an animal print
tracksuit to a nice restaurant...

...people are gonna make comments.

I agree.

Calling you a cougar with arm fat
was over the line.

Hang on.

Hello, Mia.

I'll call you back.

You don't think Mia's gonna turn
into her mother, do you?

I wouldn't worry about it.

Yeah.

What I would worry about
is you turning her into our mother.

Thanks for ruining my wedding night,
Dr. Freud.

Hey, don't set the bar too high
for the wedding night.

-What are you talking about?
-It's a long, stressful day.

You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food
and cheap champagne.

Take my advice.

Tell her you love her,
give her a big kiss...

...and try to fall asleep with your ass
pointed toward an open window.

You, sir, have the heart of a poet.

I am merely the voice
of smelly experience.

Well then, let me ask you this.

I know things didn't end well
with you and Judith...

...but overall,
did you like being married?

Oh, I loved being married.

Never missed having sex
with other women?

Sure. But I missed that
before I got married too.

What I loved was the idea of having
someone that I could always turn to.

Someone who cared about me.

Someone who'd always stand by me
through thick and thin.

It does sound nice.

Yeah, so does Disneyland.

Yet every day people stagger off
those giant teacups covered in vomit.

But you'd do it again?

What can I say?

Marriage is a great ride...

...until you puke.

-Good night.
-Good night.

Charlie.

Mia?

Your friend Rose
was just at my apartment.

So how'd that go?

She was wearing a bridal gown.
Planning on wearing it to our wedding.

She wanted me to know
so we wouldn't clash.

Well, that's kind of thoughtful, isn't it?

I'm not finished.
She wanted to give me a shower.

An engagement shower?

An actual soap and water shower.

I don't want her at my wedding.

Hey, I don't want her in my zip code.

But she's a close friend.

-Charlie.
-All right, all right, I'll tell you what...

...I'll cross Rose off the guest list...

...if you dump that pistol-packing
hermaphrodite you call a sister.

She's my maid of honor...

...the gun is registered,
and she's taking hormones.

While we're pruning,
what about your mother?

Done. She's out. Now your mother.

You would've thrown your mother
overboard for free.

I don't care. If she goes...

...somebody on your side's gotta go.
How about your father?

He takes us all out to dinner and the only
plastic he's got on him is his shoes.

Charlie, he has to give me away
at the wedding.

Give you away? That cheapskate?

I'll probably have to trade him a pony
and a couple of blankets for you.

We're gonna have a wedding that none
of our family and friends can attend?

Might as well go to Vegas and elope.

Now, there's an interesting concept.

In Vegas, not only
could we get married immediately...

...we can get drunk
and gamble away our nest egg.

Don't forget the lap dances
and hookers.

Oh, you're gonna make a great wife.

All the wonderful plans
I had for a wedding.

Let it go, Alan.

I don't understand the big rush.

You wouldn't even stop
for boutonnieres.

I just wanna get this over with.

Get this over with?

That's the attitude you take
to a proctologist, not a marriage.

Well, maybe I'm a little nervous.

-ls that all it is?
-What are you saying?

I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy,
maybe you're not ready for this.

-Did you have doubts when you married?
-None.

Judith assured me
I was doing the right thing.

That's all I got.

Hi.

-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

I was afraid you were gonna
chicken out.

That's funny, she said the same thing
about you.

Thank you, Kandi.

Are you sure this is
what you wanna do?

I'm sure. Are you?

Absolutely.

Okay. Who's the lucky couple?

Well, we're the ones getting married,
so I guess it's them.

-Charlie.
-A joke.

Alrighty. Now, before we begin
the ceremony...

...I need both your signatures
there and there.

Okay.

So are you folks staying in Vegas or are
you honeymooning somewhere else?

I don't know.
What do you think, sweetie?

Oh, can I talk to you for a second?

What'd I say?
Am I in trouble already?

Baby, I swear to God,
I think we're the lucky couple.

Relax, I just want to talk to you
about our honeymoon.

I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

Frankly, I'd pick a place
with a nice ceiling...

...because we're just gonna take turns
looking at it.

Charlie, I would love to honeymoon
with you.

But, well, I have to work...

...and I think it'd be smarter
to use the money to redo the house.

Oh, I get it.
You gave up trying to change me...

...so now the house has to suffer?

If we're gonna have a family,
we'll turn the second bedroom...

-...into a nursery.
-But that's where Jake stays.

But once Alan moves out...

...then Jake won't be staying there
anymore, right?

-Alan's moving out?
-Of course he is.

Isn't he?

This is so romantic.

When I was a little girl,
I used to love playing bride.

Me too.

I mean, I was the groom.

Most of the time.

You think you'll ever
get married again?

I don't know. I hope so.

You should because you'd make
a good husband.

You're kind, considerate, dependable and
you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat.

Oh, come on, Charlie,
we need our privacy.

But they're my family.
I can't just kick them out.

You could've said something
before now.

Who knew your idea of marriage
was you and me alone in a house?

As long as I've known you, you've been
complaining about Alan living with you.

And you want to take that
away from me?

I thought you were ready to grow up
but clearly I was wrong.

What's more grown up than wanting
to take care of my family?

Let's not forget, you're the one
who came back to me.

I only came back
because I wanted your sperm.

Yeah, well, it's a package deal.

My sperm and my brother
go hand in hand.

Kandi, this is so sudden.

I know. But lots of good things
are sudden.

Like sun showers, orgasms.

That's two things.

Multiple orgasms.

That's five.

All right, deal's off.
Let's get out of here.

Hang on. Are you really serious
about this?

You love me, I love you,
the sex is great.

The sex is unbelievable.

Wait, what'd you say?

I said the wedding's off.

Oh, my God, what happened?

It doesn't matter.

What's important is I just avoided
making a huge mistake.

Charlie, I am so sorry.

Oh, thanks.

Now let's head for a strip joint,
get drunk and let the healing begin.

Yeah, but before we do that,
I was wondering...

-...could I ask you for a little favor.
-Yeah?

-Can I borrow your wedding ring?
-What for?

Well, I thought as long
as we're in Vegas, I'd marry Kandi.

Are you insane?

Oh, come on, you're not using it.

By the powers vested in me
by the state of Nevada...

...I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

I don't freaking believe it.

Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting
what you always wanted.

I'm moving out of your house.

I don't freaking believe it.

.......... ********** ..........

-Hey.
-Hey.

So, what's going on in school?

Nothing.

Nothing? You just sit there all day
and stare at the wall?

That's where the clock is.

I got it.

Well, I find it hard to believe
that you just watch the clock all day.

Have you seen my report card?

Jake, it's for you.

-I'm busy.
-It's a girl.

I don't care.

Her name is Wendy Cho.

Hold on, I'm coming.
Don't hang up.

Hey. How's it going?

Okay, that's something
we haven't seen before.

Yeah, he only moves that fast
when he's got the squirts.

Wendy Cho is the smartest girl.
I wonder why she's calling Jake.

Maybe she lost a bet.

Charlie, that's not nice.

Well, kids are cruel.

Jake is smitten with her.

I hope he's not setting himself up
for disappointment.

Hey, you know what they say.

A man's reach must exceed his grasp,
or what's a penis for?

Who says that?

Okay, I might be paraphrasing.

Okay, call you back. Bye.

-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah, Jake?

Wendy Cho is having
a party tomorrow night, can I go?

T omorrow?
A little last minute, isn't it?

Well, she wasn't gonna invite me.

Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack
I didn't like her.

But I told Peter Calahan
to tell Ellen Meisner that I kind of did.

I see.

You do?

He lost me at Amy Sherlack.

-Are her parents gonna be there?
-I guess.

Let the fathers
who have girls worry about that.

Shut up.

All right, I'm gonna wanna meet
her parents.

I don't see any reason
why you can't go.

Cool. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need
a new shirt, new pants and new shoes.

What's wrong with the clothes
you've got?

Are you kidding?
Everybody's already seen them.

Y eah, but not
with all the latest food stains.

I hear gravy's the new black.

Fine, we'll go shopping tomorrow.

How about a new haircut?

What's wrong with my hair?

Let's just say
everybody's already seen it.

Okay, a new haircut.

So this is your first party
with girls, huh?

Maybe.

Maybe? You're not sure?

You got some cross-dressers
in sixth grade?

Playing a little pin the tail
on the tranny?

Shut up.

Why does everyone
keep telling me to shut up?

Because you' re an insensitive dolt.

That's no reason.

This is a very delicate time
in a boy's life.

I remember how nervous I was
about my first boy-girl party.

Oh, right.
That was in college, wasn't it?

Shut up.

What's important now
is that we support Jake.

Agreed.

I'll kick in the wine coolers
and condoms.

What are you gonna do?

You're joking, right?

Okay, let's say I'm joking.

I appreciate your interest,
but this is a father-son moment.

I've been looking forward to it...

...since I saw the shadow of his little
dingus in the first sonogram.

That's very touching.

And more than a bit creepy.

But still, I can't risk letting
you scar the kid forever.

-What do you mean by that?
-Face it, Alan.

What can you bring to the table...

...other than a lifetime
of abject failure with women?

It's not a lifetime yet.

I, on the other hand,
have a wealth of experience to offer.

He's 1 2. He doesn't need to know
how to choreograph a three-way.

I'm not talking about that.

I'm saving that for prom night.

Oh, good.

Let me give you an example.

Jake's at the party.
All the boys are on one side...

...all the girls are on the other.
What's he do?

You see? You see? Right there.

That "um" is the battle cry
of the chronic masturbator.

Define chronic.

The solution to the problem,
my hairy-palmed friend...

...is to walk up to the prettiest girl
and ask her to dance.

Why the prettiest?

She's the one
all the other guys are afraid of.

She'll be dying for some attention.

What if Wendy Cho
isn't the prettiest girl?

It doesn't matter.

When she sees our boy dancing with
a hot chick, she'll be all over him.

Of course, it's so obvious.

Bet you're wishing you could
do over sixth grade now, huh?

-I could've danced with Heidi Winkler.
-Yeah, you could've.

-Or Pam Talega.
-Yep.

Or Mary Beth Hicks.

Shoshana Wasserstein.

I don't think so.

Hey, can I get leather pants?

-No.
-No.

Why not?

Because you need something
that lets the farts out.

So...

...Wendy Cho, huh?

Real subtle, Alan.

Charlie, it's a father-son thing.

Yeah, so was pre-war lraq.

You wanna tell me about her?

Not really.

Is she in your class?

Where else would I meet her?
At a bar?

-My turn?
-No.

I'm just curious
about what kind of person she is.

What it is about her that you find,
I don't know, alluring.

What?

Your dad wants to know
if you think she's hot.

It's personal.

She's hot.

Are you nervous about this party?

I don't know. Maybe a little.

-Okay, here's what you do.
-Charlie.

Hey, hey, you had your shot.
"Alluring. "

-ls there gonna be dancing?
-I think so.

Terrific. Do you know how to dance?

Not exactly.

Don't worry, it's easy to fake.

The thing to remember is...

...the more you move your arms,
the stupider you look.

Oh, that is so not true.

-Just keep it simple and you'll be fine.
-Okay.

Besides, the critical time
is between dances.

What do you mean?

That's when you talk.
More precisely, you get her to talk.

-About what?
-Doesn't matter.

-You won't be listening anyway.
-Oh, Charlie.

Just drive the car.

Yeah, Dad, this is important.

Keep in mind,
you're not looking to score.

-You're getting into the batter's box.
-Wendy doesn't like sports.

You're missing the point.

She plays violin.

Listen to me.

Your goal for the party tonight...

...is to convince Wendy
you're a mature, sophisticated guy...

...who sees her not just as a woman
but as a complete human.

Got it?

-I think so.
-Good.

I'm not going.

Hey, hey, not only are you
gonna go...

...it'll be a night you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

That's what I'm afraid of.

Oh, oh, this is nice.

Yeah, sure, if he's doing
the other kids' taxes.

It's a timeless style.

No, it just seems timeless
when you're not getting laid.

Put it back.

This is cool.

Yeah. Just one question.

Is your Wendy Cho
a voodoo priestess?

No, I think she's Chinese.

Put it back.

There's something to be said for
letting him make his own choices.

Oh, that's a bunch of crap.
He's an idiot.

If we let him, he'd go to that party
in a Viking helmet and a cape.

Here we go.

Don't even think about it.

What? It says, "I've got a little money,
but I'm not a corporate drone. "

No, it says, "I'm pushing 40
and I can't deal with it. "

All right, maybe the kid needs
his own look.

Jake, come here.

-What?
-Just stand there.

Let's try and visualize
what your personal style might be.

Okay.

Maybe we should start
with the haircut.

Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming
your hair with her teeth?

Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge.

I'm guessing Ricky also
loves pretending he's a taffy apple.

Wanna take him to your guy
with the shaky hands...

...and a signed picture
of Desi Arnaz?

Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair.

So, Charles, do we have a game plan
or shall I just follow my muse?

-Can I get a Mohawk?
-No.

We should go
for something young and hip.

-Like your hairstyle?
-Sure, why not?

You'd have to kill me.

Just tighten it up a little.
Nothing extreme.

-Can you make it purple?
-No.

Oh, man.

Relax. Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's been cutting my hair for years.

What if I don't wanna look like you?

-What's wrong with the way I look?
-Nothing.

If you're a statue in front
of a Big Boy restaurant.

-Are you freaking kidding me?
-Charlie.

-The kid should be so lucky.
-We'll wait over here.

I'm buying the little wise-ass a $75
haircut and he's taking shots at me?

You said it,
he has to find his own look.

Yeah, let him find it
on somebody else's MasterCard.

-Look at his point of view.
-What's his point of view?

Well, put overalls on you and you do
kind of look like the Big Boy.

Stand like this for me.

Shut up.

By the way,
did you have the talk with him?

Oh, sure.
I mean, well, we've had a talk.

Covered the basics.
He knows where babies come from.

-How they got there.
-That's all?

He's going to this party clueless...

...about how much fun he can have
between "Hi"...

...and "What do you mean,
you missed your period? "

It's a kids' party.
Pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing.

Oh, really? You know
what I was doing at his age?

-I don't wanna hear it.
-You sure?

It involves Shoshana Wasserstein.

You danced
with Shoshana Wasserstein?

Actually, that's one thing
we didn't do.

Nevertheless, I'm Jake's father.

I believe childhood
should be a time of innocence.

I agree. Childhood should be
a time of innocence.

And Bambi's mother shouldn't die.

Lap dances should be complimentary
after the fifth cocktail.

But that's not the world we live in.

This party tonight
is the initial round...

...in a lifelong process
of sexual elimination.

-Oh, really?
-Think of it as musical chairs.

But when the music stops,
the guys who have a clue...

...are sitting on a woman
instead of a chair.

The guys who have no clue,
they'll spend their teenage years--

Well, I certainly don't need
to tell Dungeon Master Alan.

Come on, Jake,
we're gonna be late for the party.

I'm ready.

-It's very nice.
-Yeah, I think we're good.

Turn around.

You're supposed to take
the price tag off.

But you said it was good
to be seen in expensive clothes.

You still want him
to learn from his mistakes?

Fine. Can we go now?

Hang on.

Let's see the dance moves.

Don't stare at your shoes,
eyes on the girl at all times.

Pretend you care.

Good. Good. Good. Now...

...how do you stand when you know
Wendy's looking at you?

That's it. A little head bob.

Show me the sleepy eyes.

I said sleepy, not brain-dead.

All right.

-Who's the man? Who's the man?
-I'm the man. I'm the man.

Okay, let's go get them.

-Alan.
-I'm coming.

21 38...

...2136....

Try the house with the balloons
tied to the mailbox.

Oh, right.

Okay, let's go.

Where are you going?

I wanna meet her parents, say hello,
find out when to pick you up.

Alan, you take one step out this car...

...I will beat your brains out
with a tire iron.

Thank you, Uncle Charlie.

Have fun.

Call my cell when you want me
to pick you--

Up.

There he goes.

My son is attending
his first boy-girl party.

Who's that opening the door?

Oh, oh, that's Wendy Cho.

Oh, good, she's cute.
The kid's got taste.

But she's like a foot taller than him.

That's all right.

When they slow dance,
his head will be perfectly positioned.

Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.

Right, like you never copped
a feel with your ear?

No.

Okay, once with Aunt Sophie.

But that was an accident.

You know what I'm talking about.

Oh, yeah.

Here you go.

Thank you.

Oh, looks good.

She's pretty, huh?

Yeah, I guess.

What's the matter with you?

What if I sent him out there
too soon?

What if he's not ready?

Don't beat yourself,
you did everything you could.

There just wasn't enough time,
damn it.

It's out of our hands.
We let nature take its course.

Sounds good, unfortunately nature
keeps telling him to scratch his ass.

-It's Jake.
-God, I knew it. Give me that.

No, no, no, I got it.

Hey, what's up, buddy?

He wants to come home.

Why? He just got there.

Why? You just got there.

He says it's personal.

Give me that.

Jake, Jake, I'm gonna
talk you through this.

Just pipe down and listen.

Finish your cookie later.

Where's Wendy Cho right now?

How many girls is she talking to?

Okay, okay,
you gotta split her from the herd.

Walk over and say
you have something to ask her.

Then take her hand
and lead her away from her friends.

Okay, then put the cookie down first.

Now, when you have some privacy,
I want you to look her in the eye...

...and say you were lying.
You just wanted to be alone with her.

It will too work.

All right, call me back.

God, I just wish I could be there
with him.

-Me too.
-Thanks.

Ready for a refill?

Sure.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just worried about my nephew.

He's at his first boy-girl party.

Oh, that's adorable.

He's my son.

-How old is he?
-Twelve.

Kid's the apple of my eye.

You're so sweet.

Excuse me, officially,
it's my apple and my eye.

Okay.

Connie.

-Charlie.
-Would you like some pie, Charlie?

It's on the house.

Your house or mine?

You're awful. Mine.

Un-freaking-believable.

Look, Connie, I'm kind of tied up
tonight with my nephew.

Why not write your number
on the bill?

Already did.

What?

-He's my son.
-But I know how to use him.

Oh, it's Jake.

Talk to me.

No, you're the man.

You're the man.

Great. Keep me posted.

Who's the man?

Right.

What? What?

It's going well.

He's gonna be one of the last
to leave. That's a good sign.

Yeah.

You tend to lose track of time
when you're in a closet with a girl.

I just wish I could've
covered kissing with him.

Please, God, don't let him pucker.

-What's wrong?
-Oh, it's nothing.

Don't worry, Wendy will know
what to do.

She's probably been practicing
with her girlfriends.

Man, chicks are so lucky.

It's not the kissing.
It's this whole thing.

I'm sorry if I interfered
with the father-son deal, but--

No, no, no,
you've done a great job.

Jake's really lucky to have you.

So, what's the problem?

I guess I'm a little jealous.

-Of what?
-Charlie...

...do you have any idea
what it would've meant...

...to have you take me under your wing
the way you have with Jake?

Oh, here we go.

Dad was gone, there was no one
to teach me.

You know how I found out
about French kissing?

Mom sliced a plum in half
and stuck her tongue in it.

You could have taken
that secret to the grave.

And that's not all she showed me.

T o this day, I can't eat plums,
dried apricots or bananas.

All right, all right, I'm sorry.

Look, I was young, I was selfish,
I should have been there for you.

You know, it's not too late.

That's a real nice idea, buddy.

But I'm afraid it is.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Well, how'd it go?

Okay.

-Just okay?
-Alan, leave it alone.

All right.

-So, Jake, congratulations.
-For what?

You got lipstick all over your mouth.

Oh, man.

Relax, I was bluffing.

But congratulations.

Thanks.

Well, it was touch-and-go there
for a while.

But I think Jake's off
to a good start with the ladies.

Yeah, listen, Charlie.

Don't take this the wrong way...

...but I really don't want Jake
to grow up like you.

Alan, how could I possibly
take that the wrong way?

No, I mean,
I don't want him to be a player.

I want him to value women and
cherish his relationships with them.

Hey, I value women,
I cherish my relationships with them.

But I take your point.

Hey, Dad, how old
do you have to be to get married?

I guess 1 8. Why?

Just wondering how long
Wendy and I have to wait.

One kiss
and he's ready to marry the girl.

So?

So you don't have to worry.
He's definitely your son.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

I'm asking you to marry me.

We might as well just go to vegas
and elope.

If we have a family, we'll need to turn
the second bedroom into a nursery.

But that's... That's where Jake stays.

But once Alan moves out,
Jake won't be staying there anymore.

Alans moving out?

Of course he is. Isn't he?

I said, the wedding's off.

- Can I borrow your wedding ring?
- What for?

Oh, I thought as long as we're in vegas,
I'd marry Kandi. Ha.

I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

I don't freaking believe it.

Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting
what you always wanted.

I'm moving out of your house.

I don't freaking believe it.

Do we have time to play roulette
before we go?

Oh, honey, that is a sucker's game.
The odds are totally stacked against you.

Ooh, Super Slots o'Fun Jackpot.

Sure. Make the smart bet.

Here, honey, kiss it before I put it in.

And the honeymoon begins.

Slots of fun, you get it? It's s-lots of fun.

I'm ready for a refill.

Is that good?

I won. Ha-ha-ha!

I won a half a million dollars.

I don't freaking believe it.

- Alan, you're rich.
- No, we're rich.

We're married now,
what's mine is yours.

Really?

And the honeymoon ends.

Uh, excuse me.
Do you know where Charlie is?

Who's Charlie?

Charlie, you in here?

Hey, Alan.

Long time no see.

- Say hello to my brother, Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

Um...

- I'm interrupting.
- Gee, you think?

All right, listen,
I... I really need to talk to you.

Can you come downstairs?

Sure, give me...

...an hour and a half.
- An hour and a half?

I know it's a little rushed
but we're on a tight schedule here.

Tina's got homework,
Cindy's gotta meet her fiancÃ© and Marie...

Well, Marie's on the clock.

You had two women in bed
and felt the need to call a professional?

Better safe than sorry.

I see.
Well, I guess I'll just wait downstairs.

Good call.
Because, you know, five's a crowd.

Okay, does everybody remember
their assignment?

- Yeah.
- Think so.

Then let's do this thing.

Hour and a half, on the dot.

Can I plan or what?

Hey, come on, show a little class.

So how's the newlywed?

- Still living the dream?
- Well...

I gotta tell you, things haven't been
the same around here since you left.

- That's nice but...
- Yeah, they've been way better.

I mean, look around.
I don't even know these people.

And I can have sex
in every room in the house now.

I had forgotten how much fun you can have
on top of a washing machine. You know:

- That does sound fun...
- And the best part is:

Without Jake here,
Mom has no reason to visit.

Heck, I may not have to see her again
until we meet in hell.

- I'm happy for you.
- Come to think of it, without Jake...

...there's no reason for you to visit.

- I'm your brother.
- Yeah, so?

I'm your brother, I don't visit you.

Charlie, listen to me.

My wife threw me out.

Oh, dude. That's awful.

Yeah.

Well, thanks for stopping by.

Aren't you listening?
Kandi doesn't love me anymore.

My marriage is over.

My life is in ruins.

Whoa.

- What?
- DÃ©jÃ  vu.

It's as if I've lived through this before
and didn't really enjoy it.

- Charlie, I... I...
- But wait, there's a difference.

You can get your own place
instead of sponging off me...

...because you have money now, right?

- Uh, well...
- Oh, you suck.

It wasn't my fault.
There were taxes and the condo...

...and... And Kandi's new car
and Kandi's new clothes.

And... And the shoes...
oh, God, so many shoes.

How much do you have left?

Eleven dollars.

Okay, okay,
let's start from the beginning.

- Things were fine until about a month ago...
- No, no, no.

I'll go back upstairs, you knock on my door
and say you wanna talk to me.

Only this time, I'll kill you.

Oh, come on.
You're all I have left in this world.

I need you, Charlie.

Anybody here know a Charlie?

Oh, jeez.

I'm working for Caligula.

- Hi, Berta.
- Hey, Zippy.

What are you doing here?

My marriage is over.
Kandi kicked me out.

Damn, that's horrible.

Yeah.

Damn, damn, damn.

- Tell me about it.
- I had october in the pool.

- Pool? What...? What pool?
- Me, your brother, your mom...

...a couple of neighbors had a pool
on how long before she dumped your ass.

I was so close.

You were betting
my marriage would fail?

No, we were betting on when.

So Charlie took you back, huh?

Well, not with open arms
or an open heart...

...or even an open door.

After he pushed me out,
I had to climb in through the window.

But, yeah, I'm back.

Well, I'm glad.

- You're kidding.
- No. With you and the kid around...

...I won't have to hose down
the washing machine so often.

I'll get that.

I guess there's no trusting
this butter now.

Or the loose bananas.

- Hello, Alan.
- Judith.

Hey, Dad.

Hey, buddy.

So is somebody gonna explain to me
what the heck is going on?

I thought he should hear it from you.

Okay.

Jake, listen,
I know you liked Kandi very much...

...but she and I have decided
that we really can't stay married.

Oh, man.

- It doesn't mean that you can't be friends.
- No, I had December.

Alan, I just wanna say I'm very sorry
things didn't work out for you and Kandi.

Thanks.

You won the pool, didn't you?

Yeah.

And just FYI, I spoke to my lawyer.

Even if Kandi takes you
for everything you've got...

...you still have to pay me alimony.
Here's his bill.

Ha! Six hundred dollars?

He explained it very slowly.

- You didn't call.
- What?

When Dad moved out, you said you and me
could get together and do stuff.

But you never called.

Ah, jeez, Jake, I'm sorry.

I waited.

I'll make it up to you.

- When?
- Later.

I'm still here.

- What do you want me to do, Jake?
- I don't know.

You really let me down
and it hurt my feelings.

I know. I feel awful.

Fifty bucks and it goes away.

- Ten.
- Done.

Love you, Uncle Charlie.

Back at you.

How long is he gonna sit out there?

I don't know, Jake.
He's pretty depressed.

Yeah. Well, that's the price you pay
when you think with your penis.

- Did you hear that from your mother?
- No, your mother.

- And how are you feeling about all this?
- I'm okay.

- Are you sure?
- Uncle Charlie, this is not my first divorce.

Got it.

I'll tell you one thing, though,
I am never getting married.

That's a sweet dream to have, Jake.

Sooner or later, you'll meet a girl
who's smart, beautiful...

...and has a real grudge
against her parents.

- What are you gonna do then?
- Don't worry, I have a plan.

- Really?
- Yeah, if a girl falls in love with me...

...I'll tell her I can't marry till I have enough
money, even though I'll be secretly rich.

How do you plan to get secretly rich?

I'm gonna marry a movie star.

You're gonna marry a movie star
to avoid getting married?

I guess I haven't worked out
all the bugs.

Well, keep me posted.

Hey.

Hey.

Jake sure changed
in the last few months.

- I'm starting to see a real little man there.
- Mm-hm.

Not a real bright little man.

- So, what you doing?
- Making plans.

- Do they involve marrying a movie star?
- What?

Nothing. Nothing. What's your plan?

Well, I figured I'd have a nice big lunch,
get real drunk...

...stroll down to the beach
and try to swim to Japan.

Oh.

Why the lunch?

I wanna cramp up and drown
before the sharks rip me to shreds.

Well, keep me posted.

I'm a failure, Charlie.

Everything I've tried to do in my life
has ended in complete, abject failure.

Buddy, you're looking at this
the wrong way.

See, I've failed again.

Will you shut up and listen to me?

Failure is nothing to be ashamed of.

It's a part of life. It's how we learn.

Well, you know what?

I've failed for almost 40 years...

...and what have I learned?

Oh, that wasn't a rhetorical question?

Come on, Alan, you gotta have
a sense of humor about this.

A broke-ass, middle-aged guy
marries a 22-year-old knucklehead...

...just before he wins
a half a million dollars?

And then she takes him
for everything he's got? Heh.

That's hilarious.

Okay, okay.
Okay, maybe you're too close to it now...

...but trust me, it's funny.

Mm...

Where are you going?

The oceans that way.

The kid and I are going to the movies,
you wanna come?

No, thanks.

- Can I get you something to eat?
- No.

- Something to drink?
- No.

How about
a bottle of Scotch and a hooker?

I just wanna be alone.

Well, you don't need my help for that.

That's your home run swing.

Just close the door on the way out.

Fine, I'll close it.
Then I'll nail it shut and plaster it over...

...and hang a picture of something
a little more cheerful. Like a plane crash.

Okay.

I am through feeling sorry for myself.

Maybe not.

Alan?

Oh, terrific.

Charlie told me about you and Kandi.
I'm so sorry.

Yeah, well, thanks.

Did he also tell you I wanna be alone?

Yes, he did.

So want some company?

- No.
- How about a hug?

Is it a goodbye hug?

Alan, I know what it's like
to lose at love.

- Rose?
- Yes, baby?

You're a stalker.

We prefer to be called
boundary challenged.

Just go away.

Go away? Ha.

Alan, I'm a stalker.

Trust me, this pain will pass.

The aching emptiness
that's swallowing up your heart...

...will be transformed
into something beautiful.

What's that?

Resentment.

A burning, white-hot resentment...

...that empowers you to commit
unspeakable acts of revenge.

You're gonna want a scrapbook.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

Uncle Charlie's gonna take me back
to Mom's now.

Well, come in here and say goodbye.

Bye.

That's it?
Come here and give your old dad a hug.

That's better.

You still depressed?

Oh, no, no. I'm fine.

Just taking a little nap.

You've been napping for two days.

I'm getting old, Jake.

Old people nap a lot.

It's kind of a dry run for death.

Okay.

Well, see you.

See you.

- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

Even though Mom stopped loving you
and Kandi stopped loving you...

...you don't have to worry about me.

Thanks, pal.

You're my dad.
I pretty much gotta love you.

So is he still curled up
like a cocktail shrimp?

Yep.

This was a real fun weekend.

Wait in the car, Jake,
and I'll be right there.

Okay, I am running out of patience
with this guy.

I've had relationships end
and I don't go crawling into bed over it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know what I mean.

- It may not be just the relationship.
- What are you talking about?

Charlie, I've studied psychology
for eight years and been a patient for 20.

Your brother is exhibiting
all the classic signs of clinical depression.

What, you think
he might try to hurt himself?

The important question is,
do we stop him?

Oh, like I'm the only one here
thinking that.

All right,
I didn't wanna have to do this.

Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

- What are you gonna do?
- Something I hoped I'd never have to.

- You don't mean...
- I'm afraid so.

Hello?

Mom?

Oh, God, what plague
have you set upon me now?

Alan, it's Mommy.

Good one.

Oh, my poor darling.

How are you holding up?

How do you think?

I blew another marriage.

I wasted all my money.
I'm a complete and utter failure.

Oh, sweetie, you just can't see
the big picture, can you?

What big picture?

Every foolish choice you've made,
every wasted opportunity...

...every hapless misstep in your sad,
misbegotten life...

I know, I know.

It's an opportunity to learn and grow.

Well, perhaps. But more importantly,
it's a reflection on me.

Always good to see you, Mom.

- I'm not finished.
- Of course not.

There is a silver lining
in this dark cloud.

I can't wait to hear about it.

You're all alone, you're penniless
and you have no prospects.

Are we at the silver-lining part yet?

Yes.

Short of contracting a flesh-eating disease,
things couldn't possibly get any worse.

You've hit rock bottom.

You have nowhere to go but up.

You know what?

You're right.

You're self-obsessed, insensitive
and soul-sucking, but you're right.

I have stared into the abyss...

...and I'm still here.

I... I've had my heart shattered
and then shattered again...

...and I'm still here.

I've taken every piece of crap
that life could throw at me...

...and I'm still here.

Well, we don't have to turn this into
An Evening with Liza Minnelli.

Now, get washed, get dressed...

...get on with your life.
- Okay.

And remember, no matter what,
I'll always love you.

- I know. Thanks.
- Oh, don't thank me, sweetheart.

I'm your mother, I have to love you.

Hey.

- Hey.
- Thanks for taking Jake back to Judith's.

No problem.

Sorry I had to send Mom in there.

No, no, you did the right thing.

I needed a good slap in the face.

Although with Mom,
it's more like a nail gun to the testicles.

That was my thinking.

Well, I'm really grateful.

Don't mention it.

So...

...look at us, huh?

Just like old times. Ha.

Yep.

The Harper brothers, together again.

Uh-huh.

The chicks will come and go but you and I
will always be there for each other.

Sure.

Forever.

Not literally till the end of time
but, you know, till one of us dies.

It will probably be you because you don't
take very good care of yourself.

Gotcha.

Fist me.

You want me to fist you?

You know, like the bros in the 'hood.

We're the bros and this is our 'hood.

Pow! Right on.

Tell you what, I will grab us
a couple of brewskies...

...so that Team Harper
can kick back and chill.

- Terrific.
- Uh...

Well, actually, I am more in the mood
for a chardonnay...

...but I'll get you a beer.

Okay.

Oh, uh, maybe I'll make a nice little plate
of cheese and crackers.

Nothing fancy.

- Good.
- Ooh.

Uh, I don't suppose you have any Brie.

I don't know.

Not important.
You relax, I got you covered. Pow!

.......... ********** ..........

"Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims."

And yet both my ex-wives live on.

Ahem. Morning.

- Morning.
- Uh-oh.

Tsk. Not again. Please, not again. Ugh.

Thank God.

Always in the last place you look, huh?

Uh-huh.

Have a nice day.

You too.

Phil, it's Charlie.

Put me down for a grand
on Detroit tonight.

What's the line now? Well, excuse me.

But don't you think if the gambler is awake,
it behooves the bookie to be up as well?

All right, well,
call me when you get off the can.

Are you aware that your sleepover buddy
was packing heat?

Oh, yeah.

Any hotter
and she'd have burned my pubes clean off.

Charlie, a gun in the house?

Relax, she's a cop. Or was a cop.

Or is wanted by the cops.

I know she mentioned cops.

Unbelievable.
So this was another one-night stand?

Unless she comes back
for her handcuffs, yeah.

Boy, how much satisfaction
can you get from that?

Handcuffs? Not really my thing.

But she probably did some stuff...

...that might not have been
her first choice.

No, I mean, how can you possibly
get any satisfaction...

...from an endless series
of one-night stands?

As the words come out,
I realize it's a stupid question.

Forget I said it.

She's married to a cop.

I hate to see you wasting your life...

...having drunken sex
with women you don't care about.

Well, who asked you to move back in
and watch?

- You know who was good for you?
- Don't go there, Alan.

Mia. She was beautiful, she was smart,
she got you to clean up your act.

I'm telling you, letting her go
was the stupidest thing you've ever done.

You're going there, Alan.

Just saying, you had this fantastic woman
who was willing to marry you...

...and you just threw it away,
and for what?

Okay, you're there.

You wanna know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia.

- I gave her up for you.
- Oh, for me?

Yeah, yeah, for you.
She wanted you to move out...

...so we'd have the house to ourselves,
but I said, "No way.

I am not throwing my brother out
on the street."

Wow.

- What a loving gesture.
- Oh, bite me.

And you know what you did?

You married Kandi
and moved out anyway.

You wanna know why I let the best thing
that ever happened to me get away?

So the worst thing that could ever happen
to me would have a place to live.

Oh.

"Oh."

Well, I guess it all worked out
for the best, huh?

- How do you figure?
- Well, think about it.

If Mia had been living here...

...when Kandi kicked me out
and I came back, heh...

...it would've been
a very awkward situation.

Oh! Aah!

Charlie?
- Huh?

Oh, yeah. Awkward.

Phil, Phil, Phil, you're my bookie,
not my psychiatrist.

If I wanna bet every game in the country
with money I don't have...

...that's my business.

Thank you. Now let's talk boxing.

Really?
There's no fights anywhere tonight?

Okay, well, how are you
and your wife getting along?

What? It would be a fair fight.
She's got like 50 pounds on you.

Hello?

My luck. I gotta have a bookie who's afraid
to fight out of his weight class.

Aren't you worried that this betting
might be turning into a problem?

Alan, if you don't bet big,
you can't cover your losses.

And if you can't cover your losses...

...a large man with a tire iron
puts your address into MapQuest.

You have to sneak
across the Mexican border...

...dressed in womens clothing.

- Now, that's when you have a problem.
- Well, you know best.

You hungry? I...
I made your favorite sandwich.

Turkey, ham and pastrami.
Heh, gooble.

No, thanks.

Okay, how about something sweet?
Key-lime pie. Yummy, yummy.

Look, Alan,
I appreciate your sucking up...

...but you can't fill the gaping wound
in my heart with deli meat.

And pie.

Yummy.

Can't we just leave it alone?

Can we not grind on and on
about the stupidest thing I've ever done?

Okay, okay, I'm sorry I said that.

Giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

It wasn't as stupid as when you came back
from Rio with that model.

You know, the one with the Adam's apple
and the really big hands.

You know,
I'm gonna give you some space.

Maybe go for a nice drive.

Forgot my keys.

Ahh... oh. Huh.

You know,
they must have slipped out of my pocket...

...and into the couch.

Excuse me. Sorry.

Sorry.

Found some change. Ha-ha.
Oh, look, look.

Is that a quarter in your ear?

Ta-da.

Very impressive.

Aaah! Yeah!
Bab-em-stab-em-bab-em-bay-uh-dye

- What is that?
- Steven Tyler rented the house next door.

The... The guy from Aerosmith?
I lost my virginity to him.

Well, you know, his music.

Thanks, I was confused.

He's apparently getting ready for a tour.
So, what's...?

- In the box?

I went out
and picked you up something...

...I thought might put a smile
on your face.

Alan, the only thing in this box...

...that could possibly put a smile
on my face...

...is your severed head.

Good one. Zing!

Go on, open it.

- A hat?
- A very expensive hat.

Since when do I wear hats?

Well, you don't,
but I saw it and it seemed so you.

You know, cool, rakish, yet forgiving.

- Okay, fine, I forgive you.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

- Aren't you gonna try it on?
- No.

If you really forgave me, you'd try it on.

Oh, yeah. That is you.

Let's... Let's try tilting it a little bit here.
Oh, baby.

Ha-ha. You gotta see this.
Come on inside. We'll take a look.

Charlie, you coming?

- What's going on?
- You should leave, Alan.

- Why?
- Just trust me.

All right.

Hey, Tyler, take a pause for the cause.

Oh, sorry, man.

Thank you and good night.

- Hi, Charlie.
- Rose.

How cool is it
that Steven Tyler moved in next door?

I lost my virginity to him.

- You mean his music.
- No.

- Nice hat.
- Thanks. Boy, you look like hell.

Well, that's strange,
because I feel like crap.

How long do you think
you can keep it up?

What exactly are we talking about?

The excessive drinking,
the obsessive partying...

...the compulsive gambling.

Oh.

Hard to say.
I try and take it one day at a time.

You do realize this is all just an attempt
to avoid feeling your feelings.

Let me tell you something about feelings.
Feelings are like your mother's breasts.

You know where they are,
but they're best left unfelt.

Interesting analogy.

But may I point out that a mother's breasts
are a source of nourishment and comfort?

Yeah, well, my mother's breasts
were a source of silicone...

...and Russian vodka.

Not good for child-rearing,
but she was a big hit at parties.

Charlie, I know how much it hurt you
to give up Mia.

And I know you don't like that feeling,
but the more you try to get rid of it...

...the more it's going to come back.

Oh, yeah.

Perfect fit, like somebody measured
your head while you were asleep...

...so when your brother called,
she could tell him the size.

Hey, Uncle Charlie,
guess where I'm finally growing hair.

Come on, man, I'm eating.

Right here. I'm growing a 'stache.

Oh, yeah, look at that.

Hey, cool hat. Whose is it?

Yours.

- Really?
- Yeah. It looks great with the 'stache.

It just occurred to me
that I've been feeling guilty...

...because you called off your wedding
so I wouldn't move out.

But then when I did move out,
you didn't call her.

Yeah? So?

So you know why
I think you didn't call her?

You didn't call because the "I don't
wanna throw my brother out" business...

...was a convenient excuse
to get out of the marriage.

- That's what you think?
- Yes, that's what I think.

That's what you think?
You heard me.

- That's what I think.
Yeah, well, think again.

Admit it, I've been beating myself up,
buying you pie and hats, for nothing.

There's pie?

There was. Berta ate it.
And why is he wearing your hat?

- I gave it to him.
- I bought this hat for you.

- And I gave it to Jake.
- You can't commit to anything, can you?

- It's just a hat.
- It's not just a hat, it's a symbol.

- Of what?
- Of...

okay, it's just a hat.

But the point is...

...you have nobody to blame
for your miserable existence but yourself.

Drink, gamble and hump all you want.

One day
you're gonna have to face that fact.

Drink, gamble and hump.

Yeah, well, I don't have to face anything
I don't wanna face.

And I don't have to feel anything
I don't wanna feel.

That includes Mom's vodka knockers.

Who is this vod Kanockers
that you speak of?

Eat your dinner.

The name's Kanockers, vod Kanockers.

- Charlie?
- Shh.

- You okay?
- Just dandy.

Would you close the blinds?

Come on. Let's get you inside.

- It looks like you had a tough night.
- No, the night was great.

It's the morning that's killing me.

- Hey, Alan?
- What?

You were right.

I can't keep running away
from my feelings.

- Well, I'm glad you realize that.
- You're a wonderful brother.

And this is a beautiful hat.

Thank you.

- Charlie, are you okay?
I'm fine.

The hat's not so good.

Hey, Berta, wanna see my armpit hair?

Only if you wanna see mine.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- You know that's my juice.
- I know.

- You could at least ask.
- You could at least pay rent.

TouchÃ©.

If that's a bookie or a woman,
you know what to say.

Harper residence. Sorry, he's dead.

Interesting.

No one ever calls back
to find out where to send flowers.

TouchÃ©.

How's it feel to go a whole week
without booze, broads or betting?

It's actually kind of a relief.

I never realized how much effort it took
to avoid feeling anything.

- Yeah? What are you feeling now?
- So far, mostly nausea and boredom.

TouchÃ©.

- You don't know what that means, do you?
- Not a clue.

Hey, if girls with big boobs
work at Hooters...

...where do girls
with only one leg work at?

IHoP.

That's just cruel.

Actually, it's kind of funny.

Yeah, because they got one leg.
They have to hop.

Right, IHoP.

Tipping your waitress
takes on a whole new meaning.

- It's not that funny.
- I know.

- Then why are you laughing so much?
- I don't know.

Dad, something's wrong
with Uncle Charlie.

What's going on?

Hey, Jake, tell your dad
how one-legged girls work at IHoP.

Oh, no. I gave away the joke.

I'm so sorry, Jake.

I've ruined everything.

Is he okay?

He's fine.
His feelings are coming to the surface.

Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.

Well, kind of.

Hang on, Uncle Charlie,
I'll get you some chocolate.

- What's he making out there?
- A lanyard.

He's got a lot of free time now...

...so I gave him
one of Jake's old hobby kits.

You know,
so he'd have something to do.

I'm surprised he's not making a vagina
out of macaroni and bottle caps.

Over, loop around...

...around the block and then downtown.

Over, over, loop around...

...around the block and then...

Yo, dude, some of us
are trying to do crafts here.

- What?
- Can you lay off the harmonica playing?

Hey, a lot of people pay
to see me play harmonica.

They pay to hear you sing.
They tolerate the harmonica.

Sorry I don't measure up
to your musical standards...

...you lame-ass jingle writer.

Let's see how you play harmonica
out your other end.

No, no, no, let's slow down here.
Come on.

Let's see what you got, jingle balls.

I'm gonna rip off your big lips
and use them to kiss my ass.

Charlie, please, you know your emotions
are a little bit frayed now.

Right, right, okay. Okay.

I'm better.

- That's it.
- No, Charlie.

Charlie, wait. Charlie, don't do this.

Come on, Tyler. You want a piece of me?

Well, the dude may look like a lady,
but you fight like a little girl.

Did it ever occur to you to help me out?

Yeah, but once you were cowering
under his picnic table...

...I figured the worst was over.

Though quick thinking,
squirting that bottle of sun block at him.

I was hoping it would get in his eyes
and blind him.

All you did
was keep him from getting a burn...

...while he beat the crap out of you.

Please, Alan, I'm begging you.

Okay. It's not right to kick a man
when he's down.

Thanks.

Too bad Steven Tyler
didn't feel that way, huh? Heh.

You were right about Mia.

I got cold feet,
so I used you as an excuse...

...to call off the wedding.

I am so proud of you, Charlie.
This is a real breakthrough.

And doesn't it feel liberating
to finally hear yourself admit the truth?

Well, I feel something.

But since I'm also
hearing a high-pitched whistle...

...it might just be a concussion.

- What are you making?
- A needlepoint sampler.

- No kidding.
- I find it very calming.

And the message helps center me.

- "God bless vicodin"?
- Mm-hm.

- Pretty good, huh?
- You spelled "vicodin" wrong.

That's the great thing about vicodin.
I don't care.

Hey, is Charlie here?

Uh... Who may I say is calling?

It's okay, Alan.

- Hey, Chazz, thanks for the gift.
- You're welcome.

- So no hard feelings?
- No. You?

Why would I have hard feelings?

I'm still picking pieces of your ass
out of my boot.

Good one.

- Okay, well, good luck with the tour.
- Thanks a lot, man.

Who's the sponsor? Metamucil?

- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing.

I just wanna say I'm a huge fan.

- I lost my virginity to you. Heh-heh.
- Really?

Well, you know,
there's a lot of the '70s I don't remember.

- Isn't that the hat I got you?
- Yeah.

The hat you threw up in?

I had it cleaned. But I'll always know.

.......... ********** ..........

Yo, dude. What up?

Just follow my lead.

Oh, this is awesome.

Eh. It's just a little surf shack
where I keep my board, beer and brother.

How are they breaking today, broheim?

How are what breaking?

- Dude smokes way too much weed.
- Oh.

The waves, Poindexter.

Oh. Oh, the waves. The, uh...
The waves are...

...gnarly?

All right. Let's hit it.

Oh, I intend to.

Why don't you head out?
I'll throw on my suit and meet you.

Awesome.

Mm. Bodacious and tubular.

Uh, excuse me, Moondoggie.

- Quick question.
Yeah.

You don't surf, do you?

Not a bit.

So how did Gidget get the idea
you were the Big Kahuna?

I told her I hang ten
and I guess she misunderstood.

You're going to hell, you know.

I don't think so. I believe
in a loving God who forgives little fibs...

...as long as they lead
to recreational sex.

You really wanna drag God into this?

Who gave me the penis, Alan?

Since when do you have a wet suit?

Since I moved to the beach
and noticed it was full of hot surfer chicks.

If I lived next to Jellystone Park
I'd have a bear suit and a picnic basket.

Would you get the door?

Oopsie.

Smooth. So just out of curiosity...

...how exactly do you plan
to pull this off?

Simple.

Paddle out, yell shark and paddle in.

- So you've thought this through?
- I'm not an idiot, Alan.

Oopsie.

Over here.

Careful.

What happened?

I don't know,
this tiny wave came at us...

...I let it go, he screamed like a girl
and fell off his board.

I had to give him mouth-to-mouth.
He swallowed a lot of water.

He's gonna be okay?

I think so.
He tried slipping me the tongue.

Charlie, can you hear me?

Sha...

- What?
- Sha...

I think he's trying to say "shark."

- Want something to drink?
- Oh.

Yeah.

Ugh.

- What is this?
- Water.

Are you crazy?
I almost drowned in that stuff.

Where's my little hard body?

He took off with that girl
you brought home.

Other than that,
your plan worked like a charm.

Fine, go ahead and mock me,
but I could've died out there.

Well, the sea is a harsh mistress...

...and you're a moron.

What? You said to mock you.

- It's no joke, Alan.
- Oh, come on.

You tried to scam your way
into a surf bunny's shorts...

...and ended up French kissing
a handsome young lifeguard.

How is that not a joke?

It's not a joke because...

...something happened out there
while I was drowning.

What, did your entire sordid,
degenerate life flash before your eyes?

I wish.

No, no, no. It was...

Ah, you're not gonna believe me.

Try me.

I saw Dad.

Oh, baloney.

You know what? Just forget it.

Oh, come on,
it was probably just a hallucination...

...caused by, you know,
brain cells dying.

No, I'm used to that.

This was no hallucination.

Dad was right there in the water
with me.

All right, for the sake of argument...

...let's assume that you saw the spirit
of our dead father.

What did he do, reach a hand out
to guide you to the great beyond?

Don't be ridiculous.

He didn't have hands.

It was just his head
kind of floating there...

...like the great and powerful oz.

Or one of the Pep Boys.

Wow.

Manny, Moe or Jack?

Jack.

And he spoke to me.

Oh. Oh. You were able
to hear him underwater?

How weird.

Oh, that's the part that bumps you?

You were able to hear him
because you were imagining it.

- It was in your head.
- No. Oh, no.

In a million years, my mind could not
have made up what he said to me.

What did he say?

Something that made my blood run cold.

What?

- Never mind, I probably heard him wrong.
- Charlie.

Please don't make me say it.

Come on, Charlie, I am your brother.

Whatever it was,
we'll deal with it together.

He said:

"Take care of your mother."

Well, good luck with that.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Dad said you almost drowned today.

- Yep.
- Are you okay now?

I'm fine.

Can I ask you a question?

- Sure.
- It's about what happens when you die.

Okay.

Who gets your car?

Go away.

You're right. Not a good time to ask.

So...

...what are you doing?

Thinking about Dad.

Yeah, about that.

I was wondering, when you saw him...

...assuming you saw him,
did he ask about me?

No, he just said,
"Take care of your mother."

Huh.

Didn't mention me at all?

Nope.

Typical.

Oh, here we go.

I'm saying, the guy
doesn't get in touch for 30 years.

It wouldn't kill him to throw in a quick,
"Hello, Alan."

Dead or alive, that's just rude.

Tell you what,
why don't you go fill up the tub...

...I'll hold your head under the water
until the bubbles stop...

...and then you can tell him
how offended you are.

Oh, no.
I have nothing to say to him now.

How does he expect me
to take care of her?

I don't know. Why don't you try
treating her like a human being?

No, that can't be it.

What if I put her
in an assisted living facility?

That's ridiculous.
She's a healthy woman.

I'm not saying
she wouldn't put up a fight.

But, hey, crumble up
a few Xanax in her mimosa...

...and we could probably coax her
into a cave full of bats.

I don't think that's what Dad meant.

How do you know? Did he talk to you?

No. He talked to me.

Sure, rub my nose in it.

How about this?

When was the last time you called her
to see how she was doing?

Uh... ooh.

- What's today? Sunday?
- Mm.

Then never.

Why don't you start with that?

Okay, fine.

Remember her number?

I've got it on speed dial.

Six, six, six.

Cute, huh?

Hey, Mom. It's Charlie.

Nothing's the matter,
I just called to see how you're doing.

No, I'm not drunk.

I was just thinking about you
and thought I'd call.

I swear to God I'm not drunk.

Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers, you happy?

So, what's going on?

I haven't talked to you in a whi...

Well, I'm talking to you now.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Excuse me?

Okay. Okay. Okay.

So...

...everything okay?

I'm taking her to lunch tomorrow.

Voluntarily?

Wow, you must have really had
a spiritual experience out there.

Let's face it, Alan,
when Dad was alive, I was a rotten son.

Oh, you sure were.

You were horrible. I remember the time...

The point is...

...maybe I've got a chance
to make up for it now.

He wants me to take care of Mom,
then that's what we're gonna do.

Well, that's ver...
Wait a minute, did you say we?

- I'm not going.
- Fine.

Next time I see our father's floating head,
I'm gonna tell him you refused to help.

"I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him."
God, you're such a child.

- So you're coming?
- Yeah.

I can't tell you what a treat it is
to have lunch with my two favorite sons.

You have others?

It's an expression, Charlie.

Although I do sponsor
a little boy in Africa.

- No kidding.
- Oh, yes, little Mabutu.

He's in the middle of a civil war
and I still hear from him more than you.

Alan, tell Mom
what that little rascal Jake's been up to.

He hasn't been up to anything.

Okay. So...

I think I'll go to the bathroom.

- Why?
- What do you mean, why? I have to go.

When was the last time
you had a prostate exam?

It feels like I'm having one now.

I'm just expressing concern
for your health.

- You don't have to get snippy.
- I'm not being snippy.

Is it just me or is he snippy?

Try living with him.

Excuse me.

All right, what's going on?

What makes you think
something's going on?

When one of my sons calls me
for no reason...

...and agrees to take me to lunch,
something heinous is going on.

I took you to lunch two weeks ago
for no reason other than I love you.

Oh, yes, the tacky little chain restaurant
in the valley.

That fish shot out of me
like there was a fire drill.

The point is I love you.

The point is I lost four pounds
in two days.

- Well, you do look thinner.
- It's too late for flattery, darling.

Now, what is going on
with your brother?

I don't think he'd be happy with me
if I told you.

Sweetheart,
you're not his favorite person now.

Okay. Here's the thing:

Charlie almost drowned yesterday.

Oh, dear Lord.

I told him over and over again,
two drinks max in the hot tub.

No, he was surfing.

- In the hot tub?
- In the ocean.

Start again.

He was trying to impress some girl.

Ah. Oh, okay. Like the time
he broke his nose playing tetherball.

Exactly.

Anyway, he was convinced
he was near death...

...and that he saw Dad.

He saw your father?

Wow.

How'd he look?

Uh, he was just
kind of a floating head.

Yeah, that's pretty much
how I remember him.

Fairly useless from the neck down.

Anyway, Dad told Charlie
to take care of you.

Really?

- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

Just for him to take care of you.
It's like I might as well not even exist.

Oh, Alan, you can't take that personally.

First of all, Charlie was a planned baby.

What was I?

Well, dear, you were a pitcher of margaritas
and a gas station condom.

I had a nice, solid stream of urine,
thank you very much.

- What?
- My prostate is fine.

What kind of table talk is that?

You brought it up.

Doesn't matter who brought it up.
I don't wanna hear about it when I'm eating.

You know what?
This lunch was a bad idea.

Oh, no, don't say that, darling,
it was a wonderful idea.

If I'm being ungracious, I apologize.

All right, let's call it ungracious.
Though we all know what we're thinking.

I guess I'm just a little edgy
because, well...

- Never mind.
- What?

Forget it. My problems are my problems.

I don't expect you to take care of me.

Mom, just for the sake of argument,
let's say that I wanted to take care of you.

- What's going on?
- Nothing.

I'm just having
a little minor surgery tomorrow.

- What kind of surgery?
- It's a woman thing.

Anything I can do?

Just keep me in your prayers.

No, no, no. I will drive you there and then
take you to my place so you can recuperate.

Oh, sweetheart, that's very generous,
but I don't want to be a burden.

Mom, please.

That ship has sailed.

Well, then I accept.

Thank you.

Who buys condoms at a gas station?

Watch your step here.

Thank you, darling.

- What happened to your mouth?
- I just had a little procedure.

What kind of procedure?

They sucked some fat out of her ass
and shot it into her lips.

What did they do, use the whole ass?

They're just a little swollen.

In two days, they'll be plump,
luscious and ready for action.

What boy doesn't like hearing that
from his mother?

Charlie, I need to sit down.

Got you covered.

I thought... I thought you said
it was a woman thing.

Do you know any guys
dumb enough to do this?

Good Lord.

What did you do, fellate a beehive?

Fellate?

I read. I can conjugate.

Man, the last time I saw a mouth like that,
it was trying to eat Jacques Cousteau.

Here you go, Mom.

- Nice bite-size pieces.
- Thank you, darling.

Dad says you got your butt in your lips.

- Just eat your dinner.
- Hang on.

So if you burped now,
it'd really be a fart, right?

Eat.

Charlie, my doughnut's too soft.

So, Jake, has your mother succeeded
in turning you against me yet?

Mom.

What? You don't think she talks?

You don't think he listens?

Trust me, Alan,
even the mind of a dull child...

...can be poisoned by a malicious parent.

Can we just please change the subject?

Although I must say,
I prefer your mother...

...to that post-pubescent knucklehead
your father replaced her with.

Okay. Okay, that's it.

- I changed the subject.
- Jake, we're going to the movies.

- On a school night?
- Why not? You're flunking anyway.

Wait, wait, you're just leaving me?

You're taking care of Mom, remember?

That's not fair.

You got a complaint,
take it to the floating head.

- So how's work?
- Fine.

You seeing anybody special?

Nope.

Charlie, did you ever stop to think
that our relationship is strained...

...because you won't let me in,
you won't share?

You know why I won't share
with you, Mom?

Because anything I say
will be used against me.

- Oh, please.
- I have to go to the bathroom...

...maybe I have a prostate problem.

I buy a new Mercedes,
you call it a Nazi phallic symbol.

I'm seeing someone new, you ask
if I'm paying her by the hour or per schtup.

Charlie, when I say those things,
it's because I want to help you.

You're my son.
I want you to be the best you can be.

I appreciate that,
but you can stop worrying.

I'm doing fine.

I am the best I can be.

Oh, darling, that just breaks my heart.

Why would he do this to me?

"Take care of your mother."

Not like she ever took care of him.

She nagged him, humiliated him,
emasculated him.

Main reason he died so young
is because he wanted to.

Charlie, my doughnut's soft again.

Be right there.

Why?

Why do you want me
to take care of her?

Charlie.

I'm coming.

Come on, talk to me.

Give me a sign.

ROSE
Marry that cute girl down the beach.

Rose.

Yes, that's her name.

You know what?
You can tell me in person...

...because I am this close
to sticking my tongue in a light socket.

Why don't you
stick your tongue in my mouth instead?

I mean, Rose's mouth.

<i.>Yeah, boss?

Shut the door and sit down.

- What are you watching?
- Some old gangster movie.

I think she's gonna sing like a bird.

Any good?

Not really.

It just gives me a warm feeling
to know...

...that all those young,
beautiful actors are now dead.

MAN 2
The dame knows too much.

MAN 1
You want I should take care of her, boss?

MAN 2
Yeah, take care of her.

But make it look like an accident.

MAN 1
Don't worry about a thing.

I'll take care of her.

Sorry, I misunderstood.

What's that, dear?

Nothing.

Hi.

Hello.

I don't know if you remember me.
I pulled you out...

...of the ocean the other day.
- Oh, right, right, right.

- Thanks.
- It's okay. It's my job.

Well, I'm glad you did it.

I was just checking in,
see how you're doing.

- I'm doing fine.
- Good.

So you wanna walk down to the pier,
maybe grab a cup of coffee?

Gee, uh, I don't know.

Charlie.

It's time to change my butt dressing.

Ah, what the hell, let's go.

.......... ********** ..........

Kandi, Kandi, listen to me.

Our divorce does not
have to be adversarial.

Bet she won't know that word.

No, not ads for cereal.

- Told you.
- Do you know it?

That wasn't the bet.

Oh, come on, you're being very unfair.
I love Chester as much as you do.

Oh. Oh, really? Then maybe
you can explain to me...

...why I'm the one who feeds Chester,
gives Chester tick baths...

...and cleans up
when Chester piddles on the rug.

When did you change your name
to Chester?

It's not just me. Jake loves that dog too.

No, I don't.

He slobbers and he threw up in my shoe.

I had a date like that once.

You think it would've slowed me down,
but no.

All right. Can I at least talk to him?

My father talks to dogs
and they send me to a psychologist.

Hello, Chester?

It's Daddy.

Who's a good boy?

You're a good boy.

Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

Yes, you... Kandi, I wasn't finished.

Yeah, well, I have rights here.

And I intend to pursue those rights
with all the means at my disposal.

Yeah. Well, okay. Okay. Goodbye.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

Who's a moron? You're a moron.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

Well, it may be funny to you,
but that dog means a lot to me.

- This about the dog or is it about Kandi?
- It's about the dog.

I mean, we bought a condo.
She's keeping it.

We bought a car. She's keeping it.
What do I get to keep?

Certainly not your dignity.

Okay, let's look at the big picture.

You're a middle-aged guy who married
a stupid woman half his age...

...for no other reason than the sex
was great. You with me so far?

- Yeah.
- Good.

Then you ran out of money,
she got bored and threw you out.

- What's your point?
- Why does everything need a point?

Why can't I just make fun of you?

I want my dog, Charlie.

There will be other dogs.
Not in my house.

Just remember, the worst thing you can do
is fight over who gets what.

- The trick is to give her everything.
- Everything?

Whatever she wants.
When all is said and done...

...you'll get the thing that matters most.
The thing you can't put a price on.

- My dignity?
- Oh, stop it. That ship has sailed.

No, no, no, the thing you get is freedom.

The opportunity to start over.

Maybe a little sadder,
but a whole lot wiser.

The next time you meet a woman...
And trust me, you will.

- You'll have a real shot
at true and lasting happiness.

I want my dog.

Well, good luck with that because
I was lying about the other stuff.

Why don't we share custody of Chester?

You know, you get one week
and I get one week.

It doesn't make any difference.

Dog weeks and people weeks
are the same thing.

Hey, Dad, how come
you don't give me an allowance?

Your mother gives you an allowance.
I'm trying to be fair.

Speaking of fair, it doesn't seem fair
that Mom has to pay me and you don't.

Hang on, Kandi.
Let me explain something to you.

Every cent your mother has
comes from me.

So when she gives you allowance,
it's me giving you allowance.

I don't need to know how it works.
I just need more money.

Take a number.

- Sorry, go ahead.
- Six.

- Morning.
- Morning.

If Chester's gonna live anywhere full time,
I don't see why it shouldn't be here.

I do. I see why.

When he split with your mother,
did they fight over your custody?

They still do. "You take him."
"No, you take him."

Okay. Okay. Okay, fine.
You want this to get ugly?

You wanna play hardball?
I will play hardball.

- How come you don't give me an allowance?
- What are you, drunk?

Well... Yeah, well,
I am gonna get a lawyer.

I'm gonna take you to court, yeah,
and then we'll just see who gets Chester.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, have your lawyer
call my lawyer.

You know a lawyer?

Oh.

- Hi.
- What do you want, Alan?

Uh, oh, okay, right to it, huh?

Uh, well, as you know,
Kandi and I are splitting up.

Yeah, quelle surprise.

Uh... Anyhoo,
I'm gonna need a good lawyer...

...and I thought, you know,
who better than the rabid jackal...

...who ripped my lungs out
in my first divorce?

You want my lawyer?

Well, I certainly don't want mine.

Gee, I'm sorry,
but I can't give him to you.

- Why not?
- Because I already gave him to Kandi.

You're joking, right?

No, I'm smiling, but I'm not joking.

Why would you do that?

I don't know. Kicks.

Oh, Judith, when did you start
hating me so much?

Well, let's see.
I disliked you when we were married.

I resented you when we divorced.
But I don't think I hated you...

...until you started having sex
with that gorgeous 22-year-old dumbbell.

- Okay, well, thanks for clearing that up.
- Okay, bye-bye.

Look, if you really wanna make some
extra cash...

...we can find some chores
for you to do.

Oh, yeah, there's big money in that.

What kind of chores?

Well, let's see.

You could take out the garbage,
sweep up the garage, wash my car.

No, none of those sound good.

Tell you what.

I'll give you 10 bucks...

...if you can eat this entire tub
of ice cream in less than 20 minutes.

- Okay.
- Charlie, that'll shoot out of him...

...like Ben & Jerry on rocket skates.

Here. Eat these instead.

By the time they get through you,
it will be your mother's problem.

- All of them in 20 minutes, right?
- Yep.

Then can I have the ice cream?

Uh-oh.

Alan, you should've called.

I didn't feel like calling.
I wanna see my dog.

Well, maybe he doesn't wanna see you.

- Why don't we let him decide?
- No, he's been through enough.

Oh, really? Did he tell you that?

How could he tell me anything?

You know as well as I do
that he keeps everything bottled up.

- Damn it, Kandi, I wanna see my...
- Don't you yell at me.

If you have anything to say,
say it to my lawyer.

Maybe I will.

Honey, Alan has something
he wants to say to you.

Hey, Alan.

What's up?

It's you.

The jackal.

Oh, that hurts. Ahem.

Listen, as long as you're here,
is your billing address still the same?

Uh-huh.

Great. Well, I guess I'll see you in court.

Oh. And don't worry. I'm not gonna
bill you for this consultation.

There's nothing legal going on here.

Un-freaking-believable.

It's like watching a pot-smoking monkey.

- Ten dollars, please.
- Serves me right betting against a kid...

...who can eat a Happy Meal,
toys and all.

Thank you.

- What are you doing?
- You taught me always do my own count.

Yeah, but you can trust me.

Seven, eight, nine?

It was an honest mistake.

I'm sure.

So, what are you gonna do
with your winnings?

- It's a secret.
- So it's a girl.

- How did you know?
- I didn't.

Then it isn't.

Come on. Tell me about her.
Maybe I can help.

I don't think so.

Are you kidding? Who knows
more about girls than your Uncle Charlie?

Warren Beatty, Bill Clinton,
Rosie o'Donnell.

Why should I talk to you? You've messed
up every relationship you've ever been in.

Well, yeah...

- So you're not exactly a good example.
- I get it.

If I were old enough
to have one-night stands...

All right, you've made your point.

- So don't talk to me. Okay.
- I won't.

- Okay.
- Good.

- Will you drive me to the mall?
- Why?

- It's private.
- So is my car.

All right, I wanna buy a present.

- For?
- It's a secret.

- I'll throw in another 10.
- Wendy Cho.

Aha.

A present for Wendy Cho.

Now, is this an offering to grease
the wheels or a parting gift...

...for the wheels
having already been greased?

Grease the wheels? See, that's
why I don't talk to you about this stuff.

Well, he may be as dull
as a butter knife...

...but you got to admit,
he's a good judge of character.

Are you sure it doesn't have anything
to do with sex?

- Positive.
- Huh.

Sure sounds like it. Subpoenas.

Hang in there, Chester. Daddy's coming.

Oh, please, please, please.

Yes, she didn't change the lock.

But that's new.

I like those.

Skull earrings?

Yeah, they're silver
and they got ruby eyes.

Okay, first of all,
for 11.95 those aren't rubies.

- You don't know that.
- Oh, but I do.

And second, girls like Wendy Cho
don't wear skull earrings.

How do you know?

She gets straight A's, right?
She plays violin?

- She's also the captain of the math team.
- Exactly.

- So you see my point?
- Oh, okay.

How about that skull belt buckle?

No skulls.

Just out of curiosity,
does this Wendy Cho hate her parents?

I don't think so. Why?

Just trying to get a handle
on the relationship.

She says she likes me
because I'm unpretentious.

- Do you know what that means?
- It means she likes me.

Yeah, okay.

So, what do you want this gift to say?

Uh...

Happy birthday?

A birthday card says "happy birthday."

What are you trying to tell her
by giving her jewelry?

I don't know. I guess that I love her.

What?

Nothing. That's terrific.

Because you don't love any girl,
doesn't mean I shouldn't.

Excuse me, but I have loved many girls
and many girls have loved me.

That's not love. It's just sex.

I'm sorry, I'm not following you.

If you died tomorrow,
how many girls would come to your funeral?

A lot of them.

Granted, a few might show up
just to make sure I'm really dead...

...but I feel confident...

...that the overall tone of the event
would be one of sadness.

- If you say so.
- Yeah, I say so.

- Now let's get out of here.
- I haven't picked out a gift yet.

Then get her the stupid skull earrings.

- But you said she wouldn't like them.
- What do I know? Nobody loves me.

Nobody's coming to my funeral.

Whoa, where did that come from?

Here, what about
this gold heart necklace?

It's kind of expensive.

You want the best, Jake,
you pay for it.

Yeah, but $39?
I mean, I love her and everything...

If it means we can get out
of here quicker, I'll front you the difference.

- I don't know.
- You don't know? I'm offering you a deal.

Yeah, but you always say if it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.

All right, how about if I pay
for the whole thing?

That sounds even better. So no.

Come on, brainiac.

What do I have to do for you?

Just promise to be sad at my funeral.

- Do I have to cry?
- No.

Will there be food?

- Yes.
- Can I bring a date?

- You're just screwing with me now, right?
- How does it feel?

Still early. Wanna go shoot some hoops?

No, I'm gonna go call Wendy Cho.

Hey, bros before Chos.

"Thanks for the ride to the mall,
Uncle Charlie.

Thanks for buying me the necklace,
Uncle Charlie. Thanks for not slugging me...

...when I started mouthing off
about your funeral, Uncle Charlie."

Aah!

Chester...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Calm down.

Easy, boy.
Charlie, what did you do to him?

What did I do to him? I practically
crapped my pants is what I did to him.

- What the hell is that?
- This is Chester. Isn't he cute? Yes, you are.

- Yes, you are. Yes...
- He's not staying here, Alan.

With all due respect,
that's what you said about me.

That's because no kennel in town
would take you.

Oh, come on, look at him.

- How can you not love this face?
- Easy.

I know where he puts it.

- Now take him back to Kandi's.
- I can't.

- Why not?
- It's kind of complicated.

- Then simplify it.
- Okay, well, um...

...I stole him.

Oh, Alan, I may think with my penis
but at least I think.

You won't have to do anything.
I'll feed him, I'll walk him.

Walk him? You could hitch a wagon
to him and settle the West.

No dogs in my house.

Especially stolen dogs who are big enough
to make me their bitch.

Whoa, what the hell is that?

That is leaving.

Please. My entire life, Chester
is the only thing I ever slept with...

...that didn't sue me for alimony.

How long you think
you're gonna get away with this?

I was very careful. I left the door open
so that when Kandi comes home...

...she'll think she left it open
and Chester ran away.

She'll never dream
of looking for him here.

Probably.

Just in case, hide Chester.

How am I supposed to hide him?

Sit under him with a pail
and pretend he's a cow.

- Coming. Charlie, please.
- Oh, man.

Come on, Bullwinkle.

Alan Harper?

Yes. Yes. How can I help you?

We're investigating a stolen-dog report.

A dog?

Your ex-wife's dog.

Chester? Somebody stole Chester?

She seems to think you might know
his whereabouts.

Oh, gosh, um, I'm sorry.
I have no idea.

Uh... oh, although, you know,
what could've happened...

...um, she could have
left the door open...

She's absent-minded.
- Uh, and the dog got away.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey.

Oh, look who's finally off the phone.

Yeah.

When are you gonna give Wendy Cho
the necklace?

I'm not.

What happened? You chicken out?

No.

I don't believe it.

You dragged my ass
all the way down to the mall...

...I pony up 40 bucks for the necklace,
and you chicken out.

She just dumped me, you old turd.

Oh. Well, you could've told me that
before I started being a turd.

I'm only 12. I need a time machine.

Ah, dude, I am really sorry.
What happened?

She decided she has a problem
with mixed relationships.

What? Chinese and Caucasian?

Gifted and remedial.

Oh.

Yeah, well, I'm done with relationships.
From now on, I'm gonna be like you.

Why would you wanna be like me?

Because you never fall in love
with anybody, so you never get hurt.

Okay, listen to me.

Being hurt sucks...

...but love is the most beautiful
and noble of human emotions.

It's what gives a man hope.
It's what gives his life meaning.

Don't turn your back on love, Jake.

I did and I regret it every day.

- Really?
- May God strike me down if I'm lying.

All right, the game's over. Let's go.

Where are we going?

Might as well bail your dad out of jail.

Can we get something to eat first?

Sure, why not.

How long before Kandi
and her lawyer come back from Mexico?

Three more days.

Oh, God, what are you feeding that dog?

It's not the dog.

Smells a little like banana bread.

.......... ********** ..........

After the kid goes back to his mother's,
you wanna go out and grab some dinner?

I can't go out to dinner, Charlie.

Why not? You got a date?

He said knowing the answer,
but asking anyway just to be polite.

I don't have a date.

He replied, all the while thinking,
"Bite me, you booze-addled buffoon."

So why can't you go?

Are you kidding?
I'm paying alimony to two women.

I don't have money for luxuries
like eating out.

Or eating in, really.

I'm trying to learn to chew my own cud.

- That's all right. I'll treat.
- No, you've done too much for me already.

Yeah, but it's not like
I'm keeping a tab, $26,382.

To date.

Exactly. So I need to start carrying
my own weight.

Which is actually getting easier
now that I'm wasting away.

- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

I'll find something here to eat.
Maybe some scrambled eggs and a Popsicle.

Fine. See you later.

All right, I'm only gonna ask you
one more time.

- Would you like to have dinner with me?
- That depends.

- Where are we going?
- Oh, for God's sake.

What? I don't even get a vote?

You don't get a vote,
you get a free meal.

Well, if I was one of your dates,
you'd ask where I wanted to go.

You're right.

So where do you wanna go, baby?

That's very funny.

No, no, no, let's get something hot in you
and then get something hot in you.

Knock it off.

Gee, you smell good.

You know what? Okay, I'll just stay here
and have a Popsicle.

Oh, you'll be getting the Popsicle.

Fine, fine, fine.
Okay, you pick the restaurant.

Thank you. How about sushi?

Ugh. Not a big fan.

Oh, that's Judith. Keep thinking.

Jake, your mother's here.

Hey, that Popsicle almost...

- Hello.
- Hi. Yeah, he'll be right out.

Do me a favor and take them both.

- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey. Would you, uh, wait in the car?

- Who's in trouble? Me or Dad?
- No one's in trouble.

It's you.

If you're gonna chew my ass off...

...just know I'm planning on having it
for breakfast tomorrow.

No, you didn't do anything, Alan.

I just, uh...
I wanted to let you know that, uh...

Boy, this is awkward. Um...

Remember I was dating
Jake's pediatrician?

Yeah, yeah, Melnick.
Uh, what about him?

Well, we started seeing each other again
and it's gotten serious.

Oh, how serious?

He asked me to marry him
and I said yes.

Oh. Wow.

I...

I don't know what to say. Um...

I guess, congratulations.

Thank you. I just wanted to let you know
before we told Jake.

Sure. Sure. I appreciate it.

It's kind of weird, isn't it?
I mean, we spent so many years together.

It's hard for me to think of you married
to somebody else.

Yeah.

Still, I wish you the best, though.

Oh, I know you do. Thank you.

- Well, bye.
- Bye.

Five, six, seven, eight.

No more alimony

No more alimony

No more alimony

No more alimony

You know the problem with sushi?

You mean, besides eating it with you?

It's all fleshy and flappy and wet.

Feels unnatural against my tongue.

- Hey, Alan?
- What?

I think I know why your marriages
didn't work out.

Oh, stop it.
Now, speaking of marriages...

...the next time we go out to dinner,
it'll be on me.

Because with Judith
getting married again...

...I'll have...

Five, six, seven, eight.

No more alimony

No more alimony

No more alimo...

Hey, Dad.

What are you doing here?

- And how'd you get in?
- Rose let me in.

Hey, guys.

How was dinner?

Forget dinner. What are you doing here?

Keeping Jake company.

But if you let him in,
you had to have been here before him.

Well, yeah.

But if Jake hadn't shown up...

...I'd be gone by now
and you'd never know I was here.

So, what, you just waltz in and make
yourself at home whenever I'm out?

That's not true.

Sometimes you're upstairs asleep.

Wait, let's go back here.

- Jake, why aren't you at your mother's?
- I ran away.

Sometimes you're in the shower.

Rose, please. Why did you run away?

Because I hate it there.

Is this about the upcoming nuptials?

It's nothing to do with puberty, Dad.

It's about Mom getting married.

- I thought you liked Dr. Melnick.
- That was when they were just dating.

Now he thinks he can tell me what to do.
He's not my father.

- You don't do what I tell you to do.
- Yeah, but Mom doesn't care about that.

Alan, if I could just interrupt for one sec.

How do you keep getting in?
I've changed the locks three times.

Yes.
But you didn't change the locksmith.

I could recommend somebody.

Good night, Rose.

I replace everything I eat.

- Good night.
- You know how I do it?

I keep an exact duplicate fridge
at my house.

- Good night, Rose.
- By the way, we're out of Popsicles.

I'm gonna call your mother.
She's probably worried sick.

She's probably in the hot tub
with Dr. Melnick.

How'd you get here?
You steal a car or something?

How can I steal a car? I'm 12.

You kids these days. No imagination.

- I took the bus.
- In L.A.? At night?

You would've been safer stealing a car.

What's your plan?
Where are you headed?

I'm gonna stay here.

Oh, you can't stay here.

- Why not?
- Because you're running away.

Away, according to the dictionary,
means "not here."

It's usually preceded
by the words "far, far"...

...or in your case, "go."

Oh, come on.
Why can't I live with you guys?

Oh, Jake, do you have any idea
how much I have to clean up my act...

...when you're here?

What are you talking about?

I see you drink, gamble,
you have strange girls sleep over.

Uh-huh. Drop in unannounced on
a Wednesday and you'll be scarred for life.

I hope you're proud of yourself.
Your mother's crying.

Good.

Hey.

- Don't be mean to your mother.
- You're mean to your mom.

My mother can take it.

She actually feeds on it.

She wanted me to tell you
that she loves you more than anything...

...she and Dr. Melnick
aren't gonna get married...

...until you've had time to adjust
to the idea.

Then they'll never get married,
because I'm never gonna adjust to it.

- Five, six, seven...
- Shut up.

I am a little surprised at you.
I'd think you'd want your mom to be happy.

Hey, she can be happy all she wants...

...I just don't need some jerk
pretending he's my dad.

Oh, why not?

Because I already have a dad.

And he's already a jerk.

All right, buddy.

I'm gonna have to tell you
something pretty heavy.

But I think it's something
that you're old enough to understand.

You can do better than me.

Way better.

Did you know
that I'm not even a real doctor?

But Dr. Melnick is.

- So what?
- So what? Are you kidding?

He makes more money.
He can buy you better presents than I can.

Don't underestimate the value of having
a prescription pad lying around the house.

- Charlie.
- You know, if someone gets sick.

Or bored.

But I only need one dad.

And you'll only have one dad.

But there's nothing that says
you can't call him "Dad" and me "Alan."

We'll still know who's who.

I'm getting a little misty.

Forget it. I'm never gonna like him.

May I suggest you try a more,
shall we say, practical approach?

Jake, how much does your mom give you
for allowance?

Ten dollars a week.

Okay.

Uh... I'm gonna write down some
figures here and you tell me to stop...

...when you see a number that makes
you feel a little warmer toward Dr. Melnick.

I was so worried about you,
don't you ever do that again.

- Thanks for bringing him back.
- No problem.

- Isn't there something you wanna say?
- Yeah.

I love you, Dr. Melnick.

Let's get you to bed.

- You've got school in the morning...
- Hang on.

Night, Dad. See you, Alan.

Night, buddy.

Boy, he's really warming up to you.

Yeah. Listen,
have you and Judith ever discussed...

...putting Jake on any sort
of medication?

Why? What do you got?

No, no. We haven't. Why?

One minute he hates me,
the next minute he loves me.

Those kind of mood swings
aren't normal.

Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about that.

That's not an emotional problem.
That's more like, uh...

A kind of, uh...

- Charlie?
- We paid him to like you.

- You what?
- And it cost less than you might think.

But that's a good thing.
A bribable child is a controllable child.

Plus, he's not too bright,
so you can lie to him all you want.

- Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

Until he was 10, I had him convinced
that swizzle sticks were money.

Hey, hey, uh, speaking of swizzle sticks.

Have you guys considered
eloping to vegas?

- No...
- I know what you're thinking.

"Tacky, tacky," but actually, it isn't.
It's classy and very romantic.

Yeah, some of the hotel rooms
have those big mirrored walls.

It's like watching your ass bob up
and down in IMAX.

Oh.

We're gonna put things on hold
for a little while.

- Why? You love Judith, don't you?
- Of course. She's a great woman.

How's the sex?

That's a little personal, isn't it?

Hey, I didn't ask
which way you point her.

I wanna make sure you two kids
are compatible.

Oh, well, there's no problem in that area.

See, Alan? It was you.

That's me. The original
one-pump chump. Ha.

So I hear.

The thing is, I'm just not sure
I'm ready to be a stepfather.

Oh, sure you are. You'll be terrific, right?

As long as there's food,
and money in your wallet...

...you'll own the little peckerhead.

Poor baby was exhausted. He fell asleep
as soon as his head hit the pillow.

- Another plus. Sound sleeper.
- Yeah, nothing wakes that kid up.

I've had some real screamers
at my place.

It's getting late. I'd like to go to bed.

Why don't you do that?
Listen, fatherhood is no big deal.

Truth is, with the Internet and everything,
they practically raise themselves.

Alan.

You go ahead, honey. I'll be in a second.

I don't know. I just think I need
some time to get used to the idea.

No, no, no. Don't think about it.

Parenthood is like skydiving.
You gotta jump out of the old plane.

And get sucked into the old propeller.

A propeller of love.

Hey, listen, why don't we go out
and talk about this over a couple of beers?

Oh. Thanks. I really enjoy spending time
with you fellas, but I don't really drink.

That's okay, neither do I.

Well, okay, sure.
Let me just tell Judith I'm leaving.

- No, that's okay. I'll tell her. We're leaving.
- Good.

Let's go.

My first wife and I tried to have kids,
but it just didn't happen.

Then when she got sick and passed away,
I didn't think I'd ever have a family.

- Oh, that's so sad.
- Yeah.

Who was shooting blanks, you or her?

Charlie, that doesn't matter. What matters
is that he's starting fresh with Judith.

A live woman of proven fertility.

What good does that do
if he's packing a starter's pistol?

I'm fine.

You hear that? He's fine.
Jake can have a little brother.

- That would be a blessing from heaven.
- Oh, I don't know if I want more kids.

Then wear a condom.

Besides, Jake's used to being
an only child.

If there was a new one,
he'd probably eat it by mistake.

So, Herb, you haven't touched your beer.

Oh, well, like I said,
I'm not much of a drinker.

Then we need a drinking game.

How about this? Each time Alan shoots me
a dirty look, we all take a drink.

Oop. And here we go.

You guys are great guys.

I love you guys.

You know why? Because you're great.

You know, Herb, I wish more women
held their liquor the way you do.

Thank you.

I would like to propose a toast.

- To Jake.
- Ah, Jake's great.

- And to Judith.
- Absolutely. Judith's great too.

And to your upcoming marriage.

Ah, sure. What the hell.

You know what I never had?

A second beer?

No, no, a bachelor party.

Me neither. Thanks to my brother.

Oop. Bottoms up.

Mm.

Hey, why don't we make this
your bachelor party?

You know, one last big blowout
with your friends before you get married.

- But my friends aren't here.
- What about us? We're your friends.

We wish you well, right, Charlie?

Well.

Oh, come on, what do you say?

I don't know. I mean...

...if this is a bachelor party...

...wouldn't there be a couple strippers?

- Charlie?
- I'm on it.

He's gonna make a great stepdad
for Jake.

Yeah, whatever.

And with the alimony I save,
I can go out to eat every night.

In restaurants.
And I'm not talking early-bird special.

I can eat when it's dark out
with people my own age.

- Hey, does your cell phone have video?
- Yeah, why?

Observe.

What are you doing?

Just in case he decides
to back out of the wedding.

- That's blackmail.
- So?

I like it.

Hey, Herb.

Attaboy. You dumb bastard.

Uh-oh. It's Judith.

Why is she calling me at this hour?

Hello?

Of course it's me.
Who were you expecting?

Oh, my God, this is Herb's phone.

Uh, Herb is in the bathroom.

Yeah, we were just having a couple
of beers and getting to know each other.

Well, with all due respect, Judith,
before we got married, I didn't drink either.

Hey, hey. There is no call
for that kind of language.

What? I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

Yeah, I think this phone is...

...running out of batteries.

I said this phone
is running out of batteries.

Goodbye, Judith.

Think she bought it?

If she did...

...she's stupider than you.

Excuse me, fellas.

- Can either of you cash a check for me?
- Why?

I'd like to tip the ladies.

No, no, forget the tip.
We gotta get you home.

Pssh. Why would I go home
when for a extra 300 bucks...

...I can go all around the world?

He's got a point, Alan.

Herb, listen to me.
Your fiancÃ©e is worried about you.

Oh. Right.

Golly, she's gonna be pretty Po'd.

- It's okay. She doesn't need to know.
- That's right. She doesn't need to know.

Can I borrow $300?

- What are you doing?
- Call it a wedding gift.

- Are you crazy? I've gotta get him home.
- So take him home.

What are you gonna do?

I'm thinking,
maybe I'll go around the world.

God knows I've racked up
enough frequent-flier miles.

Herb?

Herb?

Herb?

Charlie, you're gonna have to help me
take him home... Charlie?

- You have a key?
- No, I don't have a key.

- Maybe he's got a key.
- Wanna go through his pockets?

Not particularly.

Why don't we leave him on the porch,
ring the bell and run?

He's not a bag of flaming dog poo.

No, that was Judith's first husband.

Oop. Dirty look. Where's my beer?

All right, all right,
I'll go through his pockets.

Ahh. Judith.

What the hell is going on here?

Well, that was close.

No, it wasn't close.

Close is when you get away with it.
That was nowhere near close.

All right, all right, it doesn't matter.

He had a good time,
he's gonna marry Judith...

...and I'm off the hook for alimony.

That's true.

- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

You did erase the video
from his cell phone, right?

Oh, boy, it'd be really stupid if I didn't.

Yes, it would.

Hey, Herb. Attaboy.

You dumb bastard.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Enjoy.

Okay, so that's one root beer...

...and one orange soda.

.......... ********** ..........

Here we are. Be it ever so humble.

Wow, this is some house.

If you ever decide to sell,
I want the listing.

Well, you'd have
to kill my mom for it, so sure.

- Can I make you a drink?
- Charlie...

...we both know I'm gonna sleep
with you.

You don't have to liquor me up.

I've been doing this a long time.
Trust me, you'll want a drink.

Oh, hey.
I didn't know you guys were home.

- Lydia, this is my brother, Alan.
- Alan, hi.

- Hi.
- So sorry to hear about your troubles.

- Troubles? What troubles?
- Oh, maybe I have it wrong.

Charlie, didn't you tell me he was divorced,
broke and living on your couch?

I don't know what she's talking about.

I am going through
a bit of a rough patch...

...but I try not to think about it too much.
- Oh, good for you.

I'd be suicidal.

You hear that? You have options.

- Anyway, this is my nephew, Jake.
- Hello, Jake.

- Hi.
- So, what grade are you in?

- Seventh.
- Well, don't you worry when other kids...

...make fun of you.
You'll show them someday.

- Nobody makes fun of me.
- You're kidding.

Why would anyone make fun of me?

And this is my housekeeper, Berta.
Berta, Lydia.

Choose your words carefully, slim.

Slim? Why, thank you.

I watch what I eat.

Going in or coming out?

Hey, uh, why don't we forget the drinks?

- Go out on the deck. Enjoy the sunset.
- All right.

- Well, it was so nice to meet all of you.
- Uh-huh.

Yeah.
- Sure.

You didn't have to be so rude.

You said they were laughing with me.

Hey, I got my own problems.

Oh, Charlie.

No need to thank me.

I wasn't going to.

Excuse me?

It was very nice. It's just if I'd known
you were gonna camp down there...

...I would have given you a lantern
and some marshmallows.

- Hey, I was just trying to be thorough.
- You were showing off.

No, no, if I were showing off,
I'd have done it with no hands.

So I can expect this kind
of effort every time we get in bed?

Well, maybe not during flu season.

And it's important to have variety.

I'm not gonna swing for the long ball.

Once in a while I'll lay down a bunt...

And how did you manage
to turn this into a bad thing?

It's not a bad thing.

Thank you.

Which is not to say if you were open
to suggestion it couldn't be better.

Oh, really.
And how could it have been better?

Ooh.

- Looks like I pushed a button.
- Yeah, well, looks like I didn't.

Charlie.

You can push an elevator button
a hundred times...

...it still won't come any faster.

Fine. Maybe next time I'll take the stairs.

Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

You were magnificent.

Astonishing.

You've ruined me for other men.

There, was that so hard?

- You boys and your little egos.
- Okay, okay, stop.

In this bed, we don't say "boys"
and we don't say "little."

Fine.

- You want me to try again?
- No, I'm a bit chafed.

Let's make the next few minutes
about pleasing you.

A few minutes? That's all I get?

Trust me, darling, with me
that's all you can handle.

- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

Do you like Uncle Charlie's
new girlfriend?

Well, I just met her the one time, so...

No, not really.

You know who she reminds me of?

The girls at school who think they rule
the world because they got their boobs.

Well, I hate to tell you, buddy,
but they kind of do.

I don't get it.
I wouldn't be mean if I had boobs.

Well, that's very admirable.

Hi there. I like you very much.

Please don't do that.

Do what? I'm just being nice.

I'm serious. Cut it out.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hello, big boy.

You really need to get him into a sport.

I'll need a sports bra.

I said quit it.

- What are you watching?
- I don't know, some Disney crap.

Where's your girlfriend?

Hey, my boob.

- She had to go pick up her kids.
- Probably from therapy.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- We don't like her.

- Who's we?
- Me and Dad.

No, no, I'd... That's not, uh...
I mean, she seems, uh, really...

No, we don't like her.

She might be a bit outspoken
but I happen to find that very attractive.

She must be dynamite in the sack.

- Where do you get this stuff from?
- Cinemax.

Well, not that my sex life
is any of your business, but...

It's not his business.
It's nobody's business.

So, uh, what does she do for a living?

Besides being a stone-cold beyotch.

HBO.

- She sells real estate.
- Oh, like Mom.

No, not like Mom.

Lydia sells high-end homes in Beverly Hills,
and Mom sells high-end homes...

...mostly on the beach.

- What are you getting so defensive about?
- I'm not.

Lydia sells homes on the beyotch.

All right, all right, that's it. Go to bed.

I wasn't mean before I got my boobs.

Boy, puberty is gonna hit him
like a shovel.

- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you, Bobby.

We haven't seen your mother here.

Maybe you just didn't recognize her.

Like Satan,
my mother can take many forms.

- Good one.
- I'm ready to order.

Of course. Apologies for the frivolity.
What would you like?

- I'll have the seared ahi tuna fillet.
- Hmm. Good choice.

- Very rare.
- That's how we serve it.

Red in the middle, not pink.

- Shall do.
- If it's pink, don't bring it.

Give it to someone who
doesn't know what rare is.

- Of course.
- Know what? Forget it.

You won't get it right.

- Is your salmon fresh?
- Flown in today.

- What time?
- I'll ask the chef.

Many forms. I thought you were joking.

You eat here regularly?

Not anymore.

So listen, uh, about this weekend.
My ex is going to be out of town.

- So I'll have the kids.
- Whoa, Lydia...

...no one loves the little ones more
than old Uncle Charlie.

Don't you think it might be
soon for me to meet your kids?

I don't want you to meet them.

- Why not?
- I'm careful about who I expose them to.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Please.

Why can't I expose myself to your kids?

I mean, why can't I meet your kids?

- Please don't make me hurt your feelings.
- You can't hurt my feelings.

All right, fine.
You're a professional boy toy.

A perpetual adolescent leading
a dissolute life.

You may have your uses, but you're not
the kind of man I want around my children.

Oh.

What made you think
that would hurt my feelings?

Two o'clock. JetBlue from vancouver.
Would you like to find out the movie?

Don't bother, I'll just have the capellini.

And I'll have the pork chop
with a baked potato.

How about a little angioplasty
for dessert?

I like a nice pork chop once in a while.

Fine, I'm not gonna tell you how to eat.

Really? Even if I chew slowly
for your pleasure?

Ahem. So yea or nay on the pork chop?

I'll have the spinach
and goat cheese salad.

- Good choice.
- Thank you.

On the food.

How many pieces of bacon
are you gonna eat?

My record's 14.
I barfed but it still counts.

Do you know what's gonna happen
if you continue to eat like this?

Yeah, I'm gonna barf.

Alan, doesn't this poor child already
have enough strikes against him?

- He's fine, Mom.
- All right.

When Jerry Springer
has to knock down a wall to get him out...

...don't come crying to me.

That wasn't Jerry, that was Dr. Phil.

I'm not saying it wasn't a turn-on, I just
think you need to trim a fingernail. Oh.

Hey, Mom.

Uh, Mom, this is Lydia. Lydia, my mother.

- Oh. Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

Boy, I'm glad I stopped
coming to work high.

So, Lydia, what do you do?

I mean, besides my son.

- I'm in real estate.
- How interesting. So am I.

Oh, yes. Evelyn Harper.
I recognize you from your bus-bench ads.

People all over town
are sitting on your face.

Well, dear, maybe someday
if you work hard...

...people will be sitting on your face too.

Thank you. When I get to be your age...

...I hope I won't be schlepping
to open houses to make a buck.

Mm-hm. Don't say "schlep," darling.
You're a bit too vanilla to pull it off.

So, Charlie, how long have you been seeing
this lovely woman?

Uh...

- How long has it been, sweetie?
- Are you telling me...

...you don't remember when we met?
- The way he drinks?

There's a good chance he doesn't remember
coming down the stairs.

- Did his father drink?
- What choice did he have?

- Charlie, don't be snide.
- And stand up straight.

This is so weird.

- Well, I really must run.
- Oh, me too.

- Can I walk you out?
- Oh, how nice.

Are you sure you don't want to stay
and finish putting on your makeup?

That's okay, I'm done.
Would you like to borrow some?

No, thanks.
I'm allergic to the drugstore brands.

What?

And they call you slow.

- You're kidding, right? You don't see it?
- See what?

- Lydia and Mom?
- What about them?

Come on, Charlie. The only difference
between those two broads...

...is you came out of one and...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hold it. Hold it.

- You think Lydia's like Mom?
- No. We think Lydia is Mom.

Okay. Okay, you guys are nuts.

This conversation is over.

Who calls me slow?

I'll tell you. There's a lot of women
in this town who work in real estate.

I thought this conversation was over.

They all wear the suits and
the designer bags. It's like a uniform.

They could be firemen.

And Mom's Lexus is a two-door
while Lydia's Lexus is a four-door.

- Worlds apart.
- It is worlds apart.

The two-door is a selfish car.
The four-door is a family car.

And you know why Lydia has a family car?
Because Lydia has children.

Unlike our mother.

Shut up.

Charlie, it's okay.

You've been working out your maternal
issues by having sex with other women.

All you're doing now
is cutting out the middleman.

Oh, that is just sick.

My point exactly.

Stupid idiot.

He's just jealous.

Lydia's smart and funny and sexy.

Way sexier than Mom.

Not that I think Mom is sexy.

New thought, new thought,
new thought.

Oh, Charlie, if you could get rid
of disturbing thoughts that easily...

...I wouldn't be making a quilt
out of your old underwear.

Hi, Rose.

I brought you a little gift.

Oedipus Rex?

It's about a guy who sleeps with his mother
and then pokes his eyes out.

I'm giving away the ending because you
might be blind by the time you get to it.

Where do you get this stuff?
You've never seen Lydia.

No, you've never seen me see her.

Lydia is nothing like my mother.
Why would I get involved...

...with a woman who even resembles
the monster who bore me?

Oh, are you gonna love this book.

- Here. Mom wants to talk to you.
- Oh, great.

Hi, Mom.

Oh, Lydia. Very funny.

- I thought so.
- I liked it.

So, what's up?
You still coming over tomorrow?

I thought your ex had the kids.

Okay, well,
why don't you bring them over?

Oh, please,
how could I possibly embarrass you?

No, no, no.
I only do that when I'm drunk.

Look, I swear I'll be on my best behavior.

Great, I'll see you then, Mom...
of the year.

Well, in my book you are.

One word and everybody
gets their eyes poked out.

Why do I have to play with kids
I don't know?

Because Lydia's bringing them over
and I didn't have time to rent a clown.

- Are they boys or girls?
- Beats me.

- How old are they?
- Not a clue.

Sounds like fun.

Hey, they're kids, you're a kid,
how tough could it be?

I mean, we're not breeding pandas here.

All right. But if they're boys,
just don't call them little dudes, okay?

- Why not?
- There was this guy Mom used to date.

And every time he'd see me,
he'd call me "Little Dude. " He was an idiot.

Okay. Okay, that's good stuff.
What else you got?

No lame magic tricks, no head rubbing
and please, no high-fives.

- Got it.
- And don't ask who wants ice cream.

- Everybody wants ice cream.
- I understand.

Even lactose-intolerant kids
want ice cream.

- Makes sense.
- Whatever you do, don't try to pretend...

...you're not sleeping with their mom.
We're not stupid.

So if I do this stuff, her kids will like me?

- No.
- Why not?

You're doing their mom.

Hello, Lydia. Hey, little dudes.
Give me five.

All right. That's what I'm talking about.

Don't worry, he's not the one I'm dating.

- There they are. Welcome.
- Hello, Charlie.

These are my sons, Andy and Joey.

- Nice to meet you guys.
- Wrong.

Shake hands with him, darlings.

Hi.

- Hey.
- Ugh. Not like that.

- Shake hands like a man.
- I am.

- Do you always have to embarrass me?
- Ha-ha-ha.

What are you laughing at?
You're no prize either.

Oh...

What?

Nothing.

Excuse me.

Hey, who wants ice cream?

Sorbet, not ice cream.

You don't want to turn into
a big tub of goo like your father.

And those are expensive new shirts.

If you stain them,
don't even bother coming back.

- What now?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

I was just thinking about mothers
and kids and crying.

So much crying.

- Well, what do you think of my boys?
- Oh, they're terrific.

And the way you interact
with them is so unbelievable.

Thank you. The older one has a chance.
The younger one I'm afraid is a lost cause.

Anyway, we have the house
to ourselves.

You feel like going upstairs?

Uh... Yeah, that's a interesting idea.

What's the matter, Charlie?

It's kind of hard to explain.

Well, why don't we go get naked
and see if that loosens your tongue?

I got my nails done.

Oh, why not? I'm going to hell anyway.

.......... ********** ..........

Throws it into the corner
off the middle, he's got a...

Hello?

Hold on. Are you in for a Suzanne?

Kind of have to be.

You didn't put your hand over the phone.

Oh, right.

Sorry, he's not here.

Give me. Give me.

Sorry about that. My brother's kid.

Yeah, dumb as a stump.

Hi.

Yeah. I'm not sure
I have the right address.

No, you got the right address.

Charlie, it's for you.

Who is it?

Karma.

What?
- Your chickens have come home to roost.

Chickens? Karma?

Alan, what the hell are you talking...?

Charlie, it's for you.

Hey. Great to see you...

...again.

Yeah. I don't think we've met.

- Really?
- Really.

Are you trying to give me a stroke?
Is that what you're trying to do?

Well, it's about time.

Oh, hey, Mom.
I got the cleaning stuff you wanted.

Well, don't just stand there.
Get in the kitchen and start using it.

Fine.

- Berta, aren't you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

Charlie, Alan, I'd like you to meet
my youngest daughter, Naomi.

The light of my life.

A little angel
who swooped down from heaven...

...and landed on a married mans penis.

- Mom.
- And when she got knocked up...

...and lost her job,
she had to come live with me.

- They fired you for being pregnant?
- Yep. Being pregnant.

And stealing a few office supplies.

Eight computers and a Xerox machine.

Not all at once.

So which one of you guys
is the rich one who likes to party?

Get to work.

All right.

When you're done in the kitchen,
you can scrub the toilets.

All right.

If she spent more time on her knees than on
her back, she wouldn't be in this situation.

Not necessarily.

Should she really be scrubbing toilets
in her condition?

Hey, when I was pregnant with her
I worked right up until my water broke.

Then I used the water to mop the floor.

I exaggerate for effect.

Wow.

Yeah, and we think our family's
screwed up.

No, no, I meant, "Wow, Naomi is hot."

- What?
- Come on. She's so ripe and luscious.

I just wanna caress that taut,
voluptuous belly and... You know.

Who are you?

Come on, you can't tell me
you don't appreciate the beauty...

...of a woman in that condition.

Okay, look, freako.

I get the aesthetic appeal of a woman
with the glow of motherhood...

...a new life growing inside of her,
blah, blah, blah.

But long story short,
once there's a bun in the oven...

...I don't feel the need to butter it.

Well, then you have missed out
on one of the great sexual experiences...

...a man can have.

There had to be one.

When Judith was pregnant with Jake...

...I don't know if it was hormones
or pheromones...

...but she just could not get
enough of me.

And ever since then,
every time I see a pregnant woman, I just:

Okay, seriously, you gotta stop that.

I'm telling you, nine months
of the hottest sex we've ever had.

Even with the morning sickness
and hemorrhoids.

Maybe that explains Jake's grades.

Morning sickness and hemorrhoids?

No, the repeated blows
to his unformed head.

You are such an idiot.

Experts agree that sex during pregnancy
is not harmful to the baby.

Experts shmecksperts. Tonight
when you're sleeping I'm gonna come in...

...and start poking you in the ear
with a hot dog.

See how you like it.

Okay, okay,
clearly we have different opinions.

All I know is,
I find pregnant women very erotic.

Oh, hey, buddy.

- Hi.
- How long have you been standing there?

Long enough to be very confused.

But we have hot dogs, right?

- Excuse me?
- Oh, it's just a little indigestion.

So she's got you
doing a little ironing, huh?

Yeah. Boy, I can't wait to get this day
over with and take a nice, hot bath.

You know, we happen to have
a Jacuzzi tub. It has those jets...

I'm okay. I'm okay.

- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

- You want me to run some water for you?
- No, I couldn't.

I gotta keep working or my mom will be
all over me like hair on soap.

Hm. You do paint a picture.

But still, you shouldn't be working
in your condition.

Come on, just sit here.
I'll finish it for you.

- Really?
- Yes, really.

Why, thank you.

You're not doing
a very good job anyway.

Ooh.

Hot.

So you know what the baby is?

Well, I'm hoping for human.

- No, no, I meant boy or girl.
- Oh, it's a girl.

Oh, that's nice. I always wanted a girl.
I mean, I love my son, but let's face it.

Girls are so much smarter
and more spiritual than boys.

Plus, we got all the boobies.

All the good ones anyway.

Of course, right now
mine feel like two big bags of wet sand.

Nice.

My back is killing me,
my feet are swollen...

...and I'm passing gas
like a NASCAR pit crew.

Well, I think you look beautiful.

Aren't you sweet.

God, it feels like she's playing Hacky Sack
in there.

- Wanna feel?
- Yes.

Okay. Come on.

What's going on here?

Oh, hi. The baby was kicking
and Naomi asked if I wanted to feel...

...and I said sure,
which is when you walked in. That's it.

- Okay.
- Yes, it is. It is okay.

Hey, you're having a new granddaughter.
What a blessing, huh?

Yeah. Sort of takes the sting
out of this one being a gullible tramp.

Now get off your rump roast
and finish the ironing.

Wait. Relax, Berta, I'll do the ironing.

Why don't you just let Naomi
take it easy?

Easy is the reason she's in this condition.

- Now get to it.
- All right.

You know, if your back
is really bothering you, I'm a chiropractor.

Zippy.
- Yes?

- Conference.
- Yes.

Zippy is kind of an affectionate nickname.
Because I'm quick.

What are you doing?
I'm trying to teach that girl responsibility.

She's gonna be a single mother
with no job skills.

I want her to be able to support herself
with some dignity.

Please. What kind of dignity
can a woman have ironing clothes...

...and cleaning strangers' toilets?

I'll tell you what kind.

The dignity of an honest buck
for an honest day's labor.

Hats off to the working gal. Excuse me.

- Berta?
Go away.

- I actually need to use the bathroom.
- Well, I'm using this one.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, Charlie, I am just aces.

All right. Would you like a magazine?

Go away.

Berta, I'm coming in.

Is it okay if I come in?

Hi.

I didn't want you to see me like this.

Yeah, well, it's better than the image
I had in my mind.

- What's wrong, Berta?
- What do you think?

- Your daughter?
- I had such hopes for her.

Of all of my girls, she was the smart one.

She was the smart one?

Go on.

I really thought Naomi
would make something of herself.

You know, a career, a family...

...a house that wasn't just a horse trailer
with a futon in it.

Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.

Who said anything
about it being my fault, you nimrod?

No, no, no, I'm... I'm... I'm just saying
that you did the best you could.

How the hell do you know?

Actually, I don't.

But I am something of an expert
on where girls go wrong.

And when they start sleeping around,
it's usually a daddy thing.

At least in my experience.

- Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

But you can stop now,
because it ain't your forte.

I'll tell you whose fault it is.

- Ronald Wiedermeier.
- Who?

The sleaze ball
who pollinated my little flower...

...then disappeared
like cupcakes at a pot party.

Damn that Ronald Niedermeier.

- Wiedermeier.
- Him too.

I'll tell you, I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

Good for you. Guys like that need to know
that there's consequences to their actions.

They need to learn
that women are people with feelings.

They're not just vaginas that talk.

Vaginas that talk?

Damn that Ronald Wiedermeier.

You may be a pig,
but in this case you're right.

Thank you. What did I say?

We need to teach Mr. Wiedermeier
a lesson.

- I don't think I said that.
- Come on.

No, really.
I'm almost positive I didn't say that.

You know, I still have to pee.

Where the hell are we?

It's called Rancho Pacoima.

It's very brown.

Yeah. Not much grows here
except meth labs and cold sores.

Just out of curiosity...

...what are we hoping to accomplish here
with this Ronald guy?

Well, in a perfect world he'd dump
his wife and marry my little hosebag.

But I'll settle for him stepping up
and paying for his mistake.

And if he declines?

That's why I brought you.

Me? All I could do at this point
is pee on his rug.

You still have to go?

Well, yeah, it doesn't evaporate.

Can't we pull over for a minute?

In this neighborhood in a Mercedes?

Sure, if you're partial to car theft
and sodomy.

- Take a left, right up here.
- That's not a road.

Well, not during rainy season.

Oh, God. I think I hit a dog.

Don't worry, it was just a rat.

It's okay, he's getting up.

- What's this stuff called again?
- Vitamin E oil.

It feels really good.

Hi, Mom. I'm ready to go.

- Where's your father?
- He's in the den rubbing oil on Naomi.

- Who's Naomi?
- Berta's daughter.

Your father's rubbing oil on a woman
in front of you?

No, I couldn't watch. It was too creepy.

Well, we'll just see about that.

Oh, and by the way, I found out
why I get bad grades. It's all your fault.

- Why is it my fault?
- You know.

Oh, yeah, Alan.

Wait in the car.

Alan, what do you think you're doing?

Oh, hi.
Naomi was worried about stretch marks.

I was showing her how vitamin E
can prevent them.

Then you walked in
and that's pretty much it.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

Why don't you pull up your top
and let her check out your belly?

I will not.

- So he rubbed this on you too?
- Oh, he rubbed, all right.

But it was only to satisfy
his own twisted needs.

Excuse me, you were the one
who was constantly horny.

And you sure took advantage of it.

Hey, when the bar is only open nine months
a decade, you drink till you puke.

And then you keep drinking.

Ha-ha. That's funny.

Hey, buddy.

You're turning into quite the little ninja,
aren't you?

- There's just one thing I don't understand.
- What's that, honey?

If you have sex with a pregnant lady,
wouldn't she have twins?

No.

Otherwise,
I'd be having a whole damn litter.

A lot of cold medicine.
Guy must have allergies or something.

You don't watch 60 Minutes, do you?

What?

- You Ronald?
- No.

Ronald, who is it?

Damn it, Darlene.
We're incognito, remember?

- You cops?
- Yeah.

I'm Scully, this is Mulder.

Listen, can I use your bathroom?

No, no. It's not functioning correctly.

We use the Chevron up the block.

- Bye.
- No bye-bye.

Ronald, this is the deal.
You knocked up my little girl.

I wanna know
what you're gonna do about it.

- Well, that depends.
- On what?

- Who's your little girl?
- Naomi.

Naomi. Oh, I haven't seen Naomi
in a real long time.

About eight, nine months?

Yeah, that sounds right.

Ew.

- Ronald? What's going on?
- Nothing, sweet cheeks.

Okay, look.

I'd like to keep this away
from the missus. She's a little volatile.

Hasn't slept really well.

You got a coffee can or a milk jug,
I could go around back?

No, no, it's a real mess back there.

Uh-oh.

Damn it, Darlene.
I told you not to smoke in there.

Well, I don't have to pee anymore.

Uh.

That feels so good.

- Sorry.
- No, no, no, don't be silly.

It's a natural bodily function.

The baby is pressing down
on the intestines and...

oh, dear Lord.

I'm sorry.

- Oh, no, no. No, it's all right.
- Okay.

I'm used to it.
When my wife was pregnant...

oh, that's got some hang time.

You are so sweet, Alan.

How come I've never met a man
like you?

Well, speaking on behalf of men like me,
we don't get out a lot.

Sorry.

I'm not.

You know,
these sweatpants are really comfortable.

That's because they're dry.

Boy, what a deal.

- What did you call that place again?
- A swap meet.

Swap meet.

Well, aside from the exploding meth lab
and peeing myself, this was a fun little trip.

I got the sweatpants,
a bag of tube socks...

...four DVDs and a corn dog
all for 8 bucks.

Just a hint. The corn dog
will last longer than the socks.

Oh, God. Oh, it's too big.

- What the hell?
- Alan, you sick freak.

Naomi.

- Oh, hi. She's having a baby.
Damn.

It's all right, honey. Mommy's here.

Oh.

What?
You never saw an angry one before?

- Out of the way, Zippy.
- It's okay, I'm a chiropractor.

You got it.

It's okay, honey, that's it, now.
Take a big deep breath and push.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.
Let me put down some tube socks.

Ignore him. Come on. Breathe.
Breathe. Now, push.

Push.

Now, you listen up, Brittany Pam.

You're my last chance.

You're gonna go to college,
you're gonna make something of yourself.

No getting knocked up by some greasy
tweaker from Rancho Pacoima.

Oh, gee, Mom, about that.

I've kind of been counting back the weeks
and Ronald can't be the daddy.

What?

Yeah, see, he was in a burn unit
at the time.

He wanted to,
but his skin just kept sliding off.

Oh, God, here comes the corn dog.

So who is the father?

- Well, I got it narrowed down.
- Oh, dear Lord.

I'll know for sure
if she starts speaking Spanish.

But we just shook down Ronald
for $5000.

We? You were hiding behind the car
pulling off your wet undies.

Make yourself comfortable.
The doctor will be right in.

Come on, freako.

You are absolutely radiant.

Best of luck.

- Thanks.
- Sorry about your couch.

Good news, honey. I got you $4000.

.......... ********** ..........

Ah. Oh! Oh, oh.

Oh, hot, hot, hot. Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God, oh.

Oh, God, oh, God.

Oh, God.

I was picturing something
entirely different.

I couldn't sleep.

So you decided
to make your nipples hard?

Oh, the peas.
No, I was heating up some milk and...

You know, my nipple is hard.

If you can't sleep,
why don't you just take a pill?

I don't believe in pills.

- What about booze? Believe in booze?
- That's not sleeping, that's passing out.

Potato, potato.

I have a lot on my mind.
I don't need to drug myself.

Okay, well, in that case,
I do know a great all-natural sleep aid.

- What's that?
- Sex, you should get yourself some sex.

It'll put you right out.

- Charlie.
- Look at me.

I can hardly keep my eyes open.

No, sex is not really an option
at the moment.

You telling me you can't make a fist?

Just leave me alone.

How about exercise?

It's kind of like sex
but without the condom.

You know, that's not a bad idea.

Well, you should always wear a condom.

No, I mean the exercise.
I could go for a run on the beach.

Sure, I've seen people do that.

Usually they have a dog,
but I think that's optional.

Actually, that's a great idea.

I don't know where
you're gonna get a dog.

You really enjoy screwing with me?

Well, you don't pay rent.

- You know what? I'm gonna do it.
- Pay rent?

No.

I'm gonna jog to the pier and back.

Maybe I can burn off my excess energy.

Attaboy.

No, I prefer the Tater Tots.

This will do it.

Burn off that energy.

That's interesting.

Nice night for a run.

How rude.

This is the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

Stop running and drop to the ground
with your arms spread.

Oh, no, no, no.
You've got the wrong guy.

- The guy you want ran that way.
- This is your last warning.

Drop to the ground
with your arms spread.

No, you don't understand.

Follow me, I'll show you.

Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

No, no, you don't understand.

I just couldn't sleep.

Release the dogs.

Dogs? No.

No, no dogs.

All right, all right, I'm coming.

This better be good.

Hey, it is good.

Charlie, tell them who I am.

I'm sorry, who are you?

Charlie, if you don't tell them,
they're gonna take me to jail.

Why do you keep calling me Charlie?

Sir, is this man living here or not?

Define living.

- Charlie, I swear on my sons life...
- Yeah, he lives here.

Told you. I have got your badge numbers.

- I am gonna write a scathing letter to the...
- Shut up.

Thank you, officers.
You are a credit to the Malibu community.

You have a nice evening.

At least this clown didn't ask
if I was Jewish.

So...

...how was your run?

Enough drumming.

Fine. Bass solo.

Oh, come on.

I'd like to have a nice quiet dinner.

And I'd like you to be a keno waitress
who can fit her entire hand in her mouth...

...but here you sit.

I'm sorry, I'm a little cranky.
I haven't slept in two days.

Why don't you take a pill?

He doesn't believe in pills.

How can you not believe in them?
They're on Tv all the time.

Let me tell you something.

Big companies want you to think
you can take a pill for everything.

Can't sleep? Take a pill.
Can't wake up? Take a pill.

Feeling sad? Take a pill.
Can't get it up? Take a pill.

Can't get what up?

Can we just eat our dinner?

Can I go back to Mom's tomorrow?

- Why?
- I wanna hang out with my friends.

All of a sudden your father's
not good enough?

It's not all of a sudden.

Come on, Alan, the kid's growing up.
He's got his own life now.

How about you have your friends
come over here?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

- No kids in my house.
- I'm a kid.

Well, I don't... I don't think of you as a kid.
I think of you as more of...

...a gassy dwarf.

Charlie, you said it yourself.

He's growing up.
Getting a life of his own.

He'll be going off to college soon.

I'll only see him on holidays.

Only hear from him
when he needs money.

Not that I'll have any.
I'll still be paying alimony to two ex-wives.

And college tuition? That just means
selling an organ or turning tricks.

And for what?

So that he can get
a worthless piece of paper...

...that he can then fold into a hat
to wear to the fast-food job...

...that he will probably be fired from
for stealing fries from the customers' bags.

I do like fries.

Sure, you can sleep.

You have no conscience.

Wake up!

- What?
- It's noon.

What day?

Saturday.

Thanks, see you Sunday.

Charlie, I have to go out.

I need you to watch Jake and his friend.

Friend? I thought I said no kids.

You say lots of stuff.

Twice a week you say
you'll never drink again.

I don't know what to believe anymore.

Where are you going?

I have to run some errands.

- So take the kids with you.
- I can't.

- Run errands later.
- Would you please...

...get your drunken ass out of bed...

...and stop being a waste of skin
for once in your life!

Well, since you said "please."

Thank you.

I'm... I'm sorry I barked at you.

- Still can't sleep, huh?
- No.

Well, don't worry, I'm here for you.
I'll keep an eye on the kids.

- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

It's like he's never met me.

Nothing seems to work.

I've tried warm milk, exercise,
meditation, self-hypnosis...

Why don't you just take a pill?

Because I don't need a pill.
The root of my insomnia is psychological.

That is why I'm sitting here with you,
a psychologist.

I'm a psychiatrist, a medical doctor,
which is why I can prescribe pills.

Is that a shot at me
because I'm just a chiropractor?

No, of course not. But I am a real doctor.

Look, can you help me or not?

You know, delve into my subconscious,
unravel the source of my problem?

Sure, I'll give it a shot.

So when was the last time you had sex?

This has nothing to do with sex.

This has to do with alimony
and ex-wives and child support...

...and writing checks I can't cover and
having to live on my brother's hide-a-bed.

- Why don't we start with your brother?
- What does he have to do with this?

- Who's the doctor here?
- Okay, that was a shot.

You got me.

Now tell me about your brother.

What is there to say?

He's two years older than me,
but much more immature.

He's charming and easy-going,
of course, why shouldn't he be?

He's never had to work for anything
in his entire life.

Money and women just seem to fall
into his big, fat, lucky lap.

So you resent him.

No, I love him. He took me in
when I needed a place to live.

Okay, you say you love your brother,
you're grateful for his help...

...and yet it must be difficult
to watch him sail through life...

...while you remain a complete
and utter failure.

I didn't say I was a complete failure.

Huh.

Why is it in my notes?

Oh, well, continue.

Okay.

Well, the worst part is that as selfish
and promiscuous as Charlie is...

...he hasn't suffered any consequences.

No palimony suits,
no bullet wounds from angry husbands.

Not so much
as a lousy urinary tract infection.

- And yet you love him.
- Well, he's family.

Oh, oh, I get it.

You think it's this internal contradiction
that's the source of my insomnia.

What do you think?

I think you may be right.

But how do I resolve it?

Well, that's a good question.
But unfortunately, we're out of time.

- Already?
- You dozed off for 40 minutes, Alan.

- You're gonna charge me for that?
- I was awake.

Fine, fine. Can I write you a check?

Oh, boy.

Alan, when a patient tells me
they're writing checks they can't cover...

...I kind of have a little cash-only policy.

All right. Where's the closest ATM?

Downstairs in the lobby.

- I'll be right back.
- I'll walk with you.

Hey.

- What you doing?
- Chatting.

- With who?
- Each other.

But you're in the same room.

What are you typing? Is that about me?

No.

Down the hall, on the right.

BRB.

- "BRB"?
- Be right back.

Ah.

Well, YAD.

- What's that?
- You're a dog.

- She's cute.
- She's just a friend.

- What are you doing?
- Oh, come on.

It's me you're talking to.

The big dog.

Okay, okay, you're starting
to freak me out.

That's my mom.

- I'll get it.
- Okay, okay, I lied.

I like her.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Woof.

There you go.

Wait, don't open the door.

- Why not?
- Coming.

Go to your room.

- What are you, nuts?
- Please don't hit on her.

- Hit on who?
- Taylor's mom.

Why would I hit on Taylor's mom?

Well, because she's kind of pretty
and you'll hit on anything with a pulse.

- Where'd you get that?
- My mom.

- Oh, well...
- And my dad, Berta, Rose, Grandma...

- Okay, okay.
...the UPS man.

All right.

And when you hit on people I know,
everything gets screwed up...

...or I have to find
a new guitar teacher, new karate class...

...Cub Scout troop...
- Okay, I get it.

- Godmother.

You don't have to worry. I'm not gonna risk
our friendship over "kind of pretty."

- So you won't hit on her?
- Absolutely not.

Hi, I'm Taylor's mom.

Scratch that.

- Okay, I will give you a call.
- Great. Bye.

You promised.

No, no. No.

The head that made the promise
is not the one that broke it.

And besides,
you said she was just kind of pretty.

- Who do you consider hot?
- Taylor.

- Taylor's 12.
- Hello.

Come on. What's the worst thing
that could happen...

...if I go out with your friend's mom?
- Do I have to explain it again?

- My guitar teacher, my karate coach...
- Okay, okay.

I can't show my face
at the comic-book store.

All right, but the worst thing
doesn't have to happen.

Would you please
just not go out with her?

Tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

I'll give up Taylor's mom
in exchange for you washing my car...

...once a week for a month.
- Done.

That includes Turtle Wax,
tire dressing and vacuuming the carpets.

- Oh, man.
- Hey, the woman is recently divorced.

I didn't ask for her number,
she gave it to me.

- You know what that means?
- No.

That means one,
maybe two dinners and...

You're waxing my car.

All right.

You're lucky
you're not painting the house.

The sacrifices we make for our kids.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You look like crap.

- Thank you. You look terrific.
- I feel terrific.

The key is a good night's sleep.

Yeah, listen, I have to talk to you.

- This is a bad time, Alan.
- How come?

Because you wanna talk to me.

Okay, what?

You know I love you, right?

Alan, are you breaking up with me?

- Would you just shut up and listen to me?
- Pick one, Alan.

All right, all right.
I talked to a therapist...

...and I think I learned something.

No, too easy. Go ahead.

The thing is...

...all these years of watching your life
go so smoothly...

...while I stumble back and forth
between humiliation and abject failure...

...has resulted in me harboring a lot
of anger and jealousy towards you.

Yeah, I get that.

How could it not?

Anyway, I think the tension
between my love for you...

...and my resentment of you
is what's causing my insomnia.

- And?
- And I thought...

...maybe if I got it out in the open,
it might help me sleep.

So how do you feel now?

Better, actually.

Like... Like a weight has been lifted.

- Well, good.
- Yeah, maybe that's it.

Maybe all I needed to do was unload.

Well, a good unloading
usually makes me drowsy.

- You're disgusting.
- True, but I sleep like a baby.

And if I wake up fussy, there's always
something nearby to put in my mouth.

I waxed your car.

What? What are you doing up?

You were out with Taylor's mom,
weren't you?

- No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure?

I think I know who I was out with.

Okay, well, maybe
you can explain this picture...

...of your perfectly waxed car
in Taylor's driveway.

Where did you get that?

Taylor took it with her phone
and e-mailed it to me.

Oh, okay.

Not my car.

What about this one of you kissing
Taylor's mom in front of the car?

Photoshop?

How was your date?

- Very nice.
- Bite me.

Okay, well, good night.

You said you wouldn't go out with her
and you did.

I had to, Jake. She called me.

What difference does that make?

I have to explain it to you?

I have to explain everything to you.

Okay, okay. Let's say you're a hunter.

If a deer takes your gun, shoots itself...

...then straps itself
to the roof of your car...

...you have to take it home and eat it.

What?

I'm sorry. I can't make it any clearer.

If you keep seeing her,
you're gonna be sorry.

Whoa, is that a threat?

No, it's a promise.

What's the difference?

I don't know.
One's a threat and one's a promise.

Oh, come on, buddy.
Let's be reasonable here.

Your relationship with your friend
is what?

Instant messaging and holding hands
at the pep rally?

What's a pep rally?

Just listen to me.

Before you know it,
you'll have forgotten all about Taylor.

You'll have forgotten her mother.

No doubt.

But I guarantee you
I'll be forgetting a lot more...

...than holding her hand at a pep rally.

Last chance, Uncle Charlie.

Ooh. I'm so scared.

"Last chance, Uncle Charlie."
Pbbt. Please.

Jake!

- What's going on?
- Nothing. Gotta go.

You're dead. You are so dead.

Damn it.

He went that way.

Thanks.

- Great slime.
- Thanks.

It's an old family recipe.

Where are you, you rat bastard?

This is the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

Get down on the sand
with your arms spread.

It's okay.

I'm just trying to kill a kid.

Release the dogs.

That's right.

Release the dogs.

.......... ********** ..........

So, what do you want?

Nachos, Red Hots, Milk Duds,
popcorn and a Slushee.

What are you doing?
Building an ass bomb?

- Pick two.
- Okay.

- Popcorn and Milk Duds.
- Fine.

- Large popcorn.
- Okay.

But I'll still need a Slushee
so I don't choke to death on a Milk Dud.

- All right.
- And ask them to pump nacho cheese...

...on the popcorn.

Oh, that reminds me.
I got a date tonight.

That reminds you?

Yeah, and I'm gonna need your help.

- My help?
Next.

Hang on.

A large popcorn with cheese...

...a large Slushee
and a jumbo box of Milk Duds.

- You want anything? My treat.
- I'm okay.

I'll just eat whatever lands
on the kid's shirt.

You're gonna go hungry.

That's it.

So, what about this date?

She's got a friend visiting
from out of town, and I said fine.

You know, two's company,
three's a sandwich.

But for some reason she insists
on the friend having her own date.

- So you're asking me?
- Yeah.

The two of us out making the scene
with a couple of hot chicks?

Oh, Lord, never mind.

Don't be silly, it'll be fun.
We never double.

- That's not an accident, Alan.
- Come on. Please, please, please?

- All right, save your begging for the date.
- I never beg.

I grovel.

I guess I'll have to find a babysitter
for Jake.

I don't need a babysitter.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

Worried about you?
I'm worried about my house.

That's $24.50.

Whoa. Okay.

Oh, jeez.

- What?
- I walked out of the house...

...without my wallet. Can you believe it?

Strangely enough, I can.

- Twenty-four-fifty, please.
- Hang on.

I know what happened. Because you drove,
it didn't occur to me to pick up my wallet.

The only reason I drove is because
you said your car was low on gas.

Twenty-four-fifty, please.

Just a minute.
You said you'd pay for parking...

...which you won't be able to do
because you "forgot" your wallet.

Don't make a big deal,
I'll pay next time.

- That's what you said last time.
- Yes, but this time I forgot my wallet.

Twenty-four-fifty, please!

Fine, I'll pay.

You know what, why don't you throw
in a bagel dog, make it an even 30.

Okay. Uncle Charlie and I
are leaving now.

- Bye.
- I'm trusting you to act responsibly...

...and go to bed at a reasonable hour.
- Okay.

You know, this is
a real turning point for you.

You're taking care of yourself.
You're becoming a man.

You too.

Boy, it seems like only yesterday that
I was bringing you home from the hospital.

You were... You were like
a little wrinkly pig with colic.

Yeah, are you going or not?

- Are you ready?
- Hang on.

Goodbye, my son.

Save it for the date, Dad.

Don't burn the place down, and if you do,
don't be here when I get back.

He knows to drink the cheap Scotch,
not the single malt, right?

- Not funny.
- I'm not joking.

He's probably just gonna mix it
with Hawaiian Punch anyway.

Oh, God, I am so full.

I don't think I could put another thing
in my mouth.

I hope that's just a figure of speech.

This is such a beautiful restaurant.

They don't have anything like this
back home.

Really? They don't have nice restaurants
in Idaho?

Oh, well, yeah. I mean, we have
a T.G.I. Friday's and an Applebee's...

...but you never see movie stars
like we did here.

Nina, they're just regular people.

And technically, I wouldn't call
Geraldo Rivera a movie star.

Well, I thought it was very exciting.

Since I'm only in town for the weekend...

...I think we should go
absolutely crazy tonight.

Is it too late to switch dates?

I'm up for that.

- No kidding.
- As long as we can switch back.

Alan, I believe it's time
we get the check.

- Agreed.
- Check, please.

- Be right back.
- Where you going?

The little boys' room.

He means the little cheap
bastards' room.

- What's that, Charlie?
- Nothing. Excuse me.

Back home we just call it the crapper.

I thought you had to pee.

I did. I do. I am.

- Nice girls.
- Yeah, they're terrific.

No matter how you shake and dance,
the last few drops fall on your pants.

Maybe you shouldn't wear khakis.

Uh-oh.

- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

Amazing.

This might take a while, Charlie.

All right, let's play.

What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?

Okay. Okay.

Hey, Alan?
Yeah?

This might take a while.

MAN
Where's Jennifer?

She went into the caretaker's shack...

...to look for Corey.

- Okay, you stay here. I'll go find her.
- No, I'm coming with you.

Will you people quit going
into the caretaker's shack?

Corey? Are you in here?

No, you idiot.
Corey's been dead for an hour.

Corey?

Man, I should have went to bed.

Are you crazy?

Well, there are several
schools of thought on that.

So your dad let you stay
by yourself tonight.

Why not? I'm old enough.
I don't need a babysitter.

Okay.
Well, then I'll leave you to your movie.

Wait, wait, you don't have to go.
Want a Pop-Tart?

Sure, why not?

So, what do I need to know?

Well, basically, when a guy
has half a face, you leave him alone.

Charlie, you still there?
I told you it might take a while.

Well, I guess this train isn't ready
to leave the station.

You know what they say, better
to be on the toilet and not have to go...

...than to have to go
and not be on the toilet.

Really? And who says that?

I don't know. It's folk wisdom.

The liquid soap is a nice idea
for the house, don't you think?

I guess.

Makes sense when you think about it.
You wash your hands with a bar of soap...

...you're passing your germs on
to the next guy...

...but with the liquid soap,
it's not an issue.

Good idea.

I'll tell Berta to pick up
some liquid soap.

Great. Great.

How funny is Berta?

She is a pistol.

Don't wanna get athlete's hand.

Another good idea for the house.

Uh-oh.

Don't even think about it.

- Where'd they go?
- Your lady friends left 20 minutes ago.

- What? Why?
- Said something about life being too short.

Are you happy?

All right, just give me the check.
Which you and I will split.

Not necessary. Mr. Rivera took care of it
before he left with the ladies.

I guess they'll find out
how at large he really is.

- Unbelievable.
- I know.

We got a free dinner.

Boy, college students are really stupid.

Yeah, if you shouldn't run
with scissors...

...you definitely shouldn't run
with hedge clippers.

I can't believe I missed out
on a sure thing...

...because I was sitting on the can
listening to you not take a crap.

Blaming me because I had
to go to the bathroom?

You didn't have to,
you were trying to stick me with the check.

Oh, I see. So you know my bowels
better than I do?

I will when I pull them out
through your nostrils.

I don't have to listen to this.

What's your hurry?
You see a check coming?

What do you think?
Should we watch the rest of the movie?

Might as well.
I'm not gonna sleep tonight anyway.

- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- No, no, no. No.

Let's get this out in the open.

There's nothing to get out.
I had to go to the bathroom.

Even though I don't have much money,
I was prepared to split the check.

Not fifty-fifty,
you had better wine...

...and your date had two appetizers,
but my fair share.

- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

Alan, you can sit but you can't hide.

I'm going to shower
and get ready for bed.

You're kidding.
You're gonna walk away from me?

Well, Charlie, when you're being irrational
you leave me no choice.

I'm not being irrational.

You wanna see irrational?
Here's irrational.

Oh, great.

My lamp.

What the hell?

I don't freaking believe it.

Charlie, the pizza's here.

So it is.

- Hey, why don't I get this one?
- Hey, why don't you?

What? No wallet?

- I'll be right back.
- I'll wait.

- There you go, Mr. Harper, 22.75.
- Thanks, Gordon. Hang on.

Keep the change.

- Wow. Thanks.
- Oh, Gordon, wait, wait, wait.

- You gotta hear something.
- Hear what?

Shh.

Wait for it.

- Was that it?
- Yep. Thanks for waiting.

Looking for something?

Yeah, my...

...wallet.

Here it is.

- Oh. Oh, thanks.
- Wow.

The legendary lost wallet of Alan Harper.

Funny.

Oh, my, there's no money in here.

- No?
- No.

How were you gonna pay
for the pizza, Alan?

I have, um...

- I have...
- What is it, Alan?

What do you have?

- Nothing.
- You sure?

Oh, where did you find that?
I mean, what is that?

About $5000 in small bills.

Wow, that much?

A little less, since I paid for the pizza.

And tipped the guy a 50.

- You gave him a $50 tip?
- Yep.

Now I'm gonna go light my cigar
with a hundred.

Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

I just remembered. I lost a big roll of bills
that looked a lot like that one.

Really? It's yours? I had no idea.

An honest mistake. Give me.

You can understand my confusion.

A guy's got this kind of cash,
you'd think he'd be able to pay...

...for his own freaking bagel dog.

You don't understand.
The money isn't for me.

Really? Who's it for?

Old Alan.

- Old Alan?
- Yeah. You know, the Alan of the future.

You're kidding. They're still gonna have
Alans in the future?

No, see, the thing is, I've been going
through a kind of a rough financial time...

...since, well, high school.

It occurred to me that I could wind up
an old man with no one to take care of me.

I mean, who will old Alan
be able to count on?

Certainly not Jake, because let's face it,
his best hope of a steady income...

...is if missing the toilet
becomes a professional sport.

So I decided that whenever somebody
in the office paid in cash...

...I'd put it away for old Alan.

- What about the IRS?
- Them? They don't care about old Alan.

Okay, let me get this straight.

You're squirreling away money
for old Alan...

...while young Alan sponges off
of dumb Charlie.

I wouldn't call you dumb.
Sweet Charlie, loving Charlie.

- Can I have my money now?
- You have a serious problem, my friend.

Yes, I do. No question.
Now give me my money.

- You need help.
- I know, but who can afford it?

All right. You know what I want you to do
with this money?

Come on, man.
I'm already constipated.

You're gonna spend it. Every penny.

But... But what about old Alan?
What will he do?

Well, I'm guessing old Alan
will be living on old Charlie's hide-a-bed...

...until they bag him and tag him.

Really? You mean no matter what,
I can always count on you?

Keep the money.

There you go. Enjoy your movie.

- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, bro.

I'll take a big box of Milk Duds.

Sure. That's $25.

- Anything for your lady friend?
- That's okay. She doesn't eat.

Food.

- Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks, Charlie.

I can always count on you.

Come on, baby.

Can you believe I'm older than him?

Boy, that's some hot chick.

Yeah.

- Don't eat the popcorn, Jake.
- Sorry, Dad.

.......... ********** ..........

So you understand the situation?

I think so.

Now that we're not married anymore
you wanna sell my condo.

No, no. It's our condo. I got it for us.

Not the smartest thing I ever did,
but my real-estate adviser was my penis.

Is that what they mean
when they say the market's gone soft?

I don't think so.

My point is, I can't afford
to carry the mortgage.

But if we sell it,
then we can split the profit.

Or I could buy you out.

- Do you have money?
- I will after we sell.

Kandi, I am at the end of my rope.

If I can't get out from under these bills,
I may well have to declare bankruptcy.

Wow.

- That sounds really serious.
- It is. Deadly serious.

Well, in that case...

...wanna have sex?

- What?
- I'm horny, you're stressed...

...seems like we'd both benefit.

Well, I am really stressed.

No, that's not gonna solve anything.

Okay, well, I'm gonna go take a shower.

- Let me know if you change your mind.
- I changed my mind.

I either drank too much...

...or got hit by a train.

- Oh, God, train.
- Charlie?

Oh, look.

It's my sweet angel
come to take me to heaven.

Don't touch me.

I hope you're proud of yourself.

Well...

...I didn't wake up in my own vomit,
so, yeah, kind of.

You are such a child.

Many people find that
to be an endearing quality.

I'm not one of them.

It would appear not.

- We had fun last night, though, right?
- Oh, terrific.

What woman doesn't enjoy
pleasing a man who falls asleep...

...while he's in the middle
of reciprocating?

Well, that explains why I dreamt
I was kissing Abe Lincoln.

Uh-oh.

Okay.

Just some underwear.

No need to panic.

And a little bit of makeup. No biggie.

Running shoes, reading glasses,
flannel nightgown...

...and the latest issue
of Modern Bride magazine.

Red alert.

Lydia?
What?

I couldn't help but notice that you put
some of your stuff in one of my drawers.

Yeah. Hey, you wanna come
in here and make up for last night?

Well, yeah, but I think we should talk
about this drawer thing.

Okay.

Talk.

Four score and seven years ago...

...our fathers brought forth upon
this continent a new nation.

Morning.

That was a great shower.

Yeah. You know, it's good when you feel
dirtier coming out than you did going in.

- So, what are you doing?
- Just practicing.

- For what?
- Nothing in particular.

- Just keeping sharp for my work.
- Oh, yeah, your little jingle thing.

Hard to believe that takes practice.

Berta, I'd like some scrambled egg whites,
dry wheat toast and Earl Grey tea.

Oh, yeah? Well, I'd like some new shoes,
a jetpack and a waistline.

You really thought
she was gonna make you breakfast.

- Yo, bro.
- Hey.

- How'd it go with Kandi?
- Great.

Just great.

Turns out we can be friends
with benefits.

Nice. And did she agree
to sell the condo?

What?

Isn't that why you went over there
in the first place?

Oh, yeah.

Son of a bitch.

Charlie...

...you need to talk to your maid.
- Shh-shh!

- Keep your voice down.
- Yeah, we don't use the M-word here.

Why not?

- Because it's disrespectful.
- Demeaning.

And wildly inaccurate.

The point is, Berta's the one
who keeps this house running...

...and more important, she's like family.

She's rude, offensive and vulgar.

Okay, exactly like family.

Fine.

See if she'll do that thing with the ice cubes
and the silk handkerchief you like so much.

Come on, sweetie, don't be like that.

Ice cubes and a silk handkerchief?

You can also use a Popsicle
and a necktie.

But I do owe you a silk handkerchief.

And your water pick's kind of iffy.

And whatever you do,
don't lick your hairbrush.

I'm sorry to come over here
and bother you again.

We never finished talking
about selling the condo.

But I don't wanna sell the condo.

I can see boats from here.

I understand,
but I can't afford the payments.

I like boats.

All right, well if you won't cooperate...

...I'll just have to call my lawyer.
What are you doing?

Chester lost his bone. I'm looking for it.

Now? Can't it wait?

No. When Chester wakes up
from his nap, he's gonna want his bone.

You can keep talking.

Okay, well, as I said, if you won't be
reasonable, I'll just have to...

Have to what, Alan?

Son of a bitch.

What the...?

We need to talk.

- Okay.
- I don't mind your girlfriends...

...throwing the occasional thong
or panties into the hamper.

I just boil them
and sell them at the swap meet.

But this broad is taking advantage
of my easy-going nature.

Now, to be fair,
Lydia does have her positive attributes.

Yeah, well, I ain't hitting any of them
attributes, so I don't give a rat's ass.

All right, all right.

You know what she said to me, Charlie?

She said I need to learn
my place around here.

Oh, she didn't.

Ah, but she did.

Is that true, Charlie?

Do I need to learn my place around here?

No, we all know your place.

- Where is that place?
- Wherever you want it to be.

There is only room for one alpha dog
in this house.

- I know.
- Who is that alpha dog, Charlie?

- You are.
- Say it.

- You're the alpha dog.
- Aw.

You sweet talker you.

We'll just pretend that's morning wood.

Hey, how's it going?

Well, look who's finally up.

I need some lotion on my back.

Oh, sure.

Listen, I have to talk to you about Berta.

For God's sake, Charlie, grow a pair.

Is this your house or hers?

Well, my name's on the deed,
but she was here first.

Thing is, over the years,
Berta and I have developed...

...a really nice working relationship and...

Do my thighs.

Right.

And the key to a happy home,
I find, is to not rock the boat...

...not tamper with that balance.

- You need to make the effort to treat her...
- Where is she now?

Huh? She went shopping.

Anybody else around?

No. Anyway, the thing with Berta...

Why don't you put sunscreen
on your cute little bottom?

- What for?
- I wouldn't want you to get a nasty burn.

Why would I get a nasty...?

Oh, you mean sex.

Good thing you're pretty
because you're very slow.

"Who's the alpha dog, Charlie?"

"Grow a pair, Charlie."

Hey, Alan, come here.

What's going on?

I'm doing Lydia's laundry.

Can I throw in my handkerchief?

It wouldn't help.
You probably have to burn it.

Okay. And why are you doing
Lydia's laundry?

Because Berta won't.

- Then why doesn't Lydia do it herself?
- Because I told her I'd get Berta to do it.

Aha.

Do you have any idea how to do laundry?

You wash them, you dry them,
how tough could it be?

So, what do you need me for?

Which one's the washer?

- That one.
- Thanks.

Just kidding, it's that one.

Sorry, it was the first one.

Look, it says "wash" on the dial.

Okay. Okay, I can do this.
I just turn it on and stick them in.

It's a washing machine,
not a cocktail waitress.

Let's start by separating her delicates.

How is that not like a cocktail waitress?

The reason you do these separately
is they're mostly synthetic.

Add a beat-up Civic and an ex-husband
and we're back to cocktail waitress.

Charming. Hand me the detergent.

This stuff here?

No, no, that's fabric softener.
You put that in after the first rinse cycle.

You know what?
Maybe I'll just buy her some new clothes.

Don't be such a baby.

Detergent. See?

There we go.

Cold wash, cold rinse,
gentle cycle, done.

What's that?

That would be water entering
the washing machine.

Amazing.

Yeah, it's pretty cutting edge.

Did I break it?

Close the lid.

Son of a gun.

What will they think of next?

Yeah, I hear scientists are working
on a machine...

...that can cook two pieces of bread
at the same time.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny.
Now what?

We wait.

- How will we know when they're done?
- Don't worry.

The machine will call you
on your cell phone.

Really?

I don't know what Berta's always
complaining about. This is fun.

Well, you're dealing
with pretty girl underwear.

Berta's gotta handle Jake's skivvies
after P.E. And pudding pops.

Good point.

- What are you doing?
- Pouring a glass of vodka.

Is that part of doing the laundry?
Because I could really get into this.

No, I'm just mad at myself.

Well, in that case, pour me one.

I'm mad at you too.

- So, what's the problem?
- I went over to Kandi's again.

And how did that go?

Not only are we not selling the condo...

...I may have promised to buy her
a new fridge.

- Alan.
- She likes getting ice...

...without having to open the door.

You poor whipped sap.

- Me? What about you?
- What about me?

- Charlie, you're doing a woman's laundry.
- No.

That's just me trying to pitch in.

Face it. Lydia's got you
wrapped around her little finger.

She does not.

She uses this one.

And it's not so much wrapped
as skewered.

Who's using my washing machine?

Excuse me, but it's my washing machine
and I'm using it to wash Lydia's clothes.

You're doing laundry?

Hey, it's not rocket science.

Cold wash, cold rinse, gentle cycle.

But first, you separate the delicates.

- Is that so?
- Yeah, that's so.

That's probably them now.

Hello?

Oh, hey, Mom.
I thought you were my washing machine.

Oh, come on, throw the ball,
throw the ball.

Or fall down.

- Charlie, I'm leaving.
- Bye.

I'd like a kiss.

She's still there, isn't she?

Yep.

Just kidding, sweetie.

That's better.

Goodbye, Jake.

I'm not kissing you.

Charlie, I almost forgot. I'm serving
hors d'oeuvres at an open house tomorrow.

So I'll borrow Berta
for a couple of hours.

Say what?

I'm talking to Charlie.

You don't mind, do you?

- Mind? Well, I...
- You wanna borrow me?

What am I, a carpet steamer?

I'm not saying I won't pay you.
Plus, you can take home all the leftovers.

Why don't you just toss them all in
a big bowl and I'll eat them out in the yard.

That's a little uncalled for.
I thought I was doing you a favor.

You wanna do me a favor?
Take the money you were gonna pay me...

...convert it into rolls of nickels,
then bend over and...

Berta, Berta, Berta.

I don't have to stand here and listen
to this. You have to make a decision.

It's her or me.

The skank's right, Charlie.

It's her or me.

Great.

That's just great.

Did somebody say there was
a big bowl of food?

You got an offer on the condo?

Oh, Mom, you're a lifesaver.

I don't care.
I fully expect to take a loss.

At least I don't have to pay you
a commission.

Oh, come on, you're my mother.

Wait, wait. Hang on,
I've got another call coming in.

Hello? Oh, Kandi. Kandi, hello.
Yeah, listen, about the condo.

My mom just got
a very reasonable offer and...

I give up, what are you wearing?

Hang on. Mom, I gotta go.
Kandi, I'll be right there.

Hey, is Berta here?

- I haven't seen her.
- Great.

I admit, I never thought you'd have
the cojones to fire Berta.

Are you kidding?

I've got huge cojones. Why do you think
I wear these baggy shorts?

Wait, wait, wait. You fired Berta?

Yes, Alan.

She didn't know her place
and she had to go.

But we can't live without Berta.

I'll be right there, sweetie.

Hurry.

You know what? We need to work
on our communication skills.

I always thought that.

- I didn't think you'd be open...
- No, no, no, you jackass.

God, you play along like a monkey
with a mandolin.

- You mean you didn't fire Berta?
- That's it, give me the mandolin.

You promised Berta
you'd get rid of Lydia.

- Alan, do you know what this is?
- No.

Then shut your stupid mouth.

And don't tell Berta she was here.

Fine. Just give me a heads up
when you're lying.

I'm always lying.

I'll give you a heads up when I'm not.

Yeah, you're the smart one.
Know how I know?

The washing machine called and told me.

Ooh! High heels and Cool Whip.

Oh, Charlie, how could you?

Berta, this is not what it looks like.

Charlie, you lied to me.

Lydia, this is not what it looks like.

- That's it, I'm out of here.
Me too.

Berta? Lydia? Come on, wait.
This is not what it looks like.

Say it a few more times, Charlie.
Maybe somebody'll believe you.

Berta. Berta, Berta, Berta. Wait, wait, wait.
You can't quit.

- Why not?
- Because we're family. We love each other.

- We forgive each other our shortcomings.
- Oh, bite me.

Don't go. Don't go.

I promise I'll break it off with her.

No, you won't. And you wanna know why?
Because you are addicted to this broad.

Oh, that's ridiculous.
I can stop any time I want.

No, you can't. You're a nookie junkie
and I just can't trust you anymore.

No, no, no. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

You're right.

I am addicted.

I've got a vagina on my back,
but I know I can get it off.

I mean, you gotta help me.

I can't help you, pal.
You've gotta help yourself.

- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Oh, come on, Berta, don't go.

- I'll do anything.
- I'm leaving now.

You don't have to.

I just fired her.

Goodbye, Charlie.

Oh, come on, Lydia, don't go.
I'll do anything.

You know what?
I don't need either one of you.

I can do my own laundry
and I've got my own finger.

I don't like it here.

Well, tough. This is the only way
I could get Berta to come back.

But why do I have to be here?

Because it's the only way
you're ever gonna sell your condo.

Okay, let's get started.

Welcome to our regular
Monday night meeting.

Do we have any newcomers?

My name is Charlie
and my maid says I'm a sex addict.

Hi, Charlie.

Hi. I'm Alan...

...and I have a lovely condo for sale.

And I'm a sex addict.

Hi, Alan.

It's priced to move.

Hi, my name is Pam...

...and I'm a sex addict.

Hi, Pam.

.......... ********** ..........

Joy to the world
I'm getting laid

I'm getting laid tonight

We'll light the yule log, deck the halls

And then we'll play some jingle balls

It's been a real long wait

This is our second date

It's Christmas Eve
And I'm getting laid

Hey. I'm mixing up the eggnog.

You want this broad lit up
or just slightly glowing?

Let's see, we're celebrating
peace on earth...

...and goodwill towards all mankind,
so let's get her plowed.

Hallelujah.

Gloria

Tonight I'm boinking Gloria

Four call girls, three French maids
Two drunk twins

And a lap dance in a pear tree

Ahh.

- Merry Christmas, Uncle Charlie.
- Oh, right, the other part of Christmas.

- Go ahead, open it.
- Uh, hold on.

Let me give you your gift first.

Don't want you to think I forgot you.

A hundred bucks? Wow!

Picked it out myself.

Now open yours.

Okay. Ahem.

This is kind of exciting.

"Fart in a can"?

You don't have one, do you?

Well, I've got you.

But this is good for travel.

Jake, I just talked to your mom.
She's gonna be here any minute.

Don't look at Uncle Charlie's gift,
you're getting the same thing.

- Oh, boy, I'm excited.
- Don't be.

Oh. Speaking of gifts...

...Merry Christmas.

I'll leave it up to you.

Open it tomorrow morning
at your mom's...

...or you can rip it open
with your teeth like a rabid jackal.

- You got me the new Nintendo?
- It's from Uncle Charlie too.

You owe me $ 125.

- But I just...
- oh, this is so cool. Thanks, Dad.

- Thanks, Uncle Charlie.
- Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas.

- I'm gonna go hook it up.
- No, no, no. You're leaving.

Your Uncle Charlie's hooking up.

- You're leaving too, right?
- Yes, relax.

I plan on spending Christmas Eve
at a movie theater by myself...

...just so you can have sex tonight.

You can have sex too.

Just pick the right movie theater.

Jake, time to go.

Take some paper towels
and don't wear your suede shoes.

Ho-ho-ho.

That's another option.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas. Come on in.

- Hey, Merry Christmas, Charlie.
- Yeah, swell. I'll go get the kid.

Ooh, eggnog.

We've got a long drive.
We're spending the holidays in San Diego...

...with my parents.
- That's why I need eggnog.

Hey, I spent Thanksgiving
with your parents.

Oh? Oh, really? Your mom's out of rehab?

Yes, my mom's out of rehab.

Actually, she kind of jumped the fence.

The woman's gonna be your mother-in-law.
Might as well get used to it.

Remember the time she rode out
of Betty Ford on a lawn mower?

On the plus side, she bakes Toll House
cookies with walnuts and Demerol.

Stuff never goes back in the box
the way it came out.

That's a life lesson, Jake.

Come on, your mom's here. Vamoose.

Okay. Table's set on the deck...

...and dinner's in the oven.
- Great.

Keep the candles away from the eggnog.

Got it.

All right, then, I'm leaving now.

- Goodbye and thanks.
- Yeah, Merry Christmas.

- Merry Christmas.
- All the best.

Same to you.

Give me my bonus, you blockhead.

Oh, right.

Thank you for all your hard work.

I couldn't get along without you.

You're one in a million.

Really?

What would Jesus do?

- Herb?
- Oh, no, thanks, I'm driving.

- I'll have some.
- No, you won't. It's for grownups.

- I'll have another.
- Sweetie, my parents are waiting.

I know, dear.

Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

Okay, Merry Christmas to all
and to all a goodbye.

Hang on, I got a long bus ride
and I don't wanna sober up halfway home.

KANDl:
Hello?

Kandi? What are you doing here?

I didn't wanna be alone on Christmas Eve.
I didn't know where else to go.

Where's your new boyfriend?

He decided to spend Christmas
with his family.

Why didn't he bring you along?

He thought it would make his wife
uncomfortable.

Oh. Sweetie, come on in.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've got company coming, remember?

- I can't just throw her out.
- How do you know if you don't try?

- Lighten up. It's Christmas.
- Okay.

Two minutes and then I bring out
the fart in a can.

You remember Judith.
KANDl: Hi, Judith.

- Hello.
- And this is her fianc? Herb.

- KANDl: Hi, Herb.
- Hi.

Here, let me take your coat.

Oh, my golly.

- Well, I guess we should get going.
- What's the hurry?

Your parents are waiting,
remember?

What do you care?
They don't like you anyway.

Eggnog?

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

I'm a doctor.

A real one or like Alan?

I'm a pediatrician.

Wow. So you're into feet?

- No, children.
- Isn't that illegal?

Berta, don't you have a bus to catch?

And miss this show? Are you nuts?

Feliz Navidad, everyone.

I didn't see that one coming.

- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I was on my way to a party.

Thought I'd drop off gifts so I don't have to
schlep here tomorrow and mess up my day.

- Charlie?
- Uh, Rose.

How could you have a Christmas party
and not invite me?

- This isn't a Christmas party.
- Well, what do you call it?

The beginning of a news story
that ends with the phrase:

"He then turned the gun on himself."

All right, all right, everybody, listen up,
listen to me.

There is no party.

You have to leave now
because a beautiful woman is coming over.

And I intend to get her drunk
and have sex with her.

That's a good plan.

Except I'm already drunk.

Boy, I can't wait till the second act.

Here we go. More fuel for the fire.

You said you were going home.

That's was before I knew
you were having a party.

This isn't a party.

It's just a bunch of people I don't like,
standing around, drinking my booze.

Oh, crap, it is a party. Give me that.

- I'd love to know what they're talking about.
- I could tell you. I read lips.

- Really?
- Yep.

Right now your date is saying:

"The wily ostrich sank my boat."

I have a little congestion in my upper chest.
Can you take a look at it?

- Oh, well, I could...
- Kandi, he's a pediatrician.

- He only treats children.
- Now, hold on.

There's no actual age limit.

I took an oath to ease suffering
wherever I find it.

Alan, a word.

Oh, good, "a word."

I don't have my stethoscope, so why
don't you just breathe in and out for me?

Make this stop.

I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

Don't screw with me. Tell your ex-wife
to stop flirting with my fianc?

Gee, that's funny. The way I see it...

...your peanut butter
is all over my chocolate.

Damn it, Alan.
I can make your life a living hell.

How would I know the difference?

Cough again.

Once more.

- Let's have a little powwow.
- She might have a touch of the croup.

- Listen, Herb...
- So you were married to her?

Yes, we were married.

- Judith is getting really upset with you.
- So you got to see her naked?

Stay with me, Herb.
Your fiancée is very angry.

Really? How come?

I don't know. Maybe it's because you were
trying to use Kandi's nipple as a Q-Tip.

It's okay. I'm a doctor.

Just do yourself a favor.
Go pay some attention to Judith.

Oh, all right.

Some party, huh?

Yeah, I'm glad I didn't waste this buzz
on the bus.

Here comes your mom. Act like
you didn't know what they were saying.

- Charlie, I must talk to you.
- I know. Why is that?

How serious is your relationship
with Gloria?

Not that it's your business,
but this is our second date.

What happened on the first date?

They went out to dinner, he took her home.
They made out a bit in the car.

Oh, I'm sorry. Did you wanna tell it?

- So you haven't slept together?
- Not yet.

Oops. There I go again.

That's good. Uh, darling, you need
to end this relationship now.

Why?

- Do you trust me?
- No.

Okay, but you know I have
your best interests at heart, don't you?

No.

All right, then, let me put it this way:

I forbid you to see this woman anymore.

You forbid?

What gives you the right to forbid?
I'm 39 years old.

I'm your mother, you're 40,
and you must not see this woman anymore.

Mom, you know that just makes me
want her more.

- Charlie, I mean it.
- I'm getting hotter.

Look, I know certain things about
Gloria's past which are, well, unsavory.

Okay, I'm going supernova.

Would you listen to me?

If you continue to see this woman...

...it will hurt me, deeply.

I may have to marry this girl.

Okay, okay.

You give me no choice.

- Who are you calling?
- It's probably about the ostrich and the boat.

Charlie, I'm getting pretty drunk...

...so if you like a girl who moves,
you better do me soon.

Follow me.

Aw, isn't that sweet?

Every time a guy has sex,
an angel gets a stiffy.

Will you look at them?

Oh, I completely forgot
about the subplot.

What do you want me to do? He's your man.
You want him? Fight for him.

How can I compete with that?

There's no competition. Herb loves you.

You have a mature, sophisticated
relationship based on mutual respect.

All Kandi has is...

There'll be other men.

All right, just get here
as soon as you can.

Where's Charlie?

Oh, damn it.

Oh, I get it.

It's like Tony and Tina's Wedding.
You gotta follow them around.

- Hey, Mommy-o, Daddy-o.
- Hi, buddy.

Mommy-o, Daddy-o, Daddy-o,
Mommy-o, Mommy-o, Daddy-o.

Stop!

- Mom.
- Get out of that bed this instant.

Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.

Charlie, I'm warning you.

You can't tell him what to do,
he's 34 years old.

- He's what?
- She's drunk.

Mom, what are you doing here?

I'm trying to keep you
from making a horrible mistake.

What do you care?
I make this mistake on a regular basis.

Some might call it a lifestyle.

- Charlie, I...
- I don't wanna hear it.

I came up here to do a job.
Actually two jobs and a chore.

Now, you can stay and watch,
which I don't recommend, or you can leave.

Either way, Gloria and I
are going to have sex.

Go ahead.

Okay, I'm bluffing.

He sure is.

- Uh, have you seen Jake?
- Nope.

Huh.

Jake?

- Whoa!
- Oh!

Judith, what the hell are you doing?

You told me to fight for my man,
I'm fighting for my man.

Alan, would you please close the door?

Sorry.

Twelve years of marriage,
she never fought for me from that angle.

- Kandi?
- Yeah?

- Take a break.
- Okey-doke.

- Hello.
- Oh, my goodness, are you Alan?

- Uh, yes.
- I haven't seen you in 35 years.

No kidding.

Uh, I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

I'm not surprised. At the time, you were
busy learning to use the big-boy potty.

Ah. Well...

...I did it.

Good job. Ha, ha.

Um, listen, Alan,
I'm looking for my daughter.

- Drunk blond?
- Well, she isn't always blond.

- Upstairs.
- Ah. Thank you.

You know...

...you turned out to be
a very attractive man.

- Oh, thank you.
- Could have gone either way.

Lucky you grew into those ears.

Damn it, Charlie, you don't know
what you're getting into here.

Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.

What could you tell me about Gloria
that would get me kick her out of bed?

She's married? Clinically insane?

- She's a man? You're not a man?
- Nope.

Then we're good.

- Gloria, get out of that bed.
- Mom.

"Mom"?

- Well, did you tell them?
- I tried, but I couldn't.

- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

- Why do you think?
- As usual, I have to do your dirty work.

You can't sleep with him
because he might be your brother.

There, was that so hard?

Ha. It's certainly not hard for someone
who has no shame.

Says the woman who killed my husband.

I did not kill Sherman.

- I made Sherman happy.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, hold on. Hold on.

Can we go back to the part
where I may be her brother?

Oh, dear Lord, has the blood
not returned to your brain yet?

It was the '70s.
We were young, attractive couples.

And there was a gas shortage,
so we had to entertain at home.

Wait, wait, wait.

Are you saying you and her husband...?

Yes, and she and your father.
So blame OPEC.

It started with a weekly fondue party...

...but one night
the dipping didn't stop at cheese.

Unfortunately,
some of us couldn't handle it.

You did unspeakable things with Sherman
and then he wanted to do them with me.

Oh, nonsense. I just raised the bar a bit.

Raised the bar? Do you have any idea...

...how many Third World countries he
visited to find someone to do those things?

He didn't have to go abroad,
he was just looking for a bargain.

If it weren't for you, he would never have
contracted amoebic dysentery and died.

I hate to interrupt, but I'm still trying
to process the "I'm her brother" thing.

Mm. Not the shiniest penny in the roll,
is he?

Now, all right, I guess
I'd better spell it out for you.

Based on the amount of time
that elapsed...

...between the last fondue party
and Gloria's birth...

...and not to mention the fact that Sherman
lost interest in traditional sex with me...

Thank you very much.

- There is the very real possibility
that your father may be her father.

- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

So you can see why a tryst of this nature
is completely unacceptable.

It's not like we couldn't have
foreseen this...

...given that your son
has spent the bulk of his adult life...

...humping his way
through the greater Los Angeles area.

Oh, and like this booze-addled tart
is an innocent victim.

Hey, I'm drunk, not deaf.

Just get out of bed and get dressed.

Well, that was humiliating.

Be glad we didn't have to tell them
about our little experiment.

- Don't remind me.
- Oh, you loved it.

Oh, a third-act twist. Ha.

Wow.

- Yeah.
- I am so horny right now I can't believe it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Did you miss
what just went down here, sis?

Oh, come on. It's not like
we're gonna get married...

...and have a bunch of web-footed kids.

You have absolutely no boundaries,
do you?

Well, I don't like fat guys.

Interesting.

Turns out I draw the line at incest.

So you'd do a fat guy?

Did you hear that?

Charlie found his boundary.

It's a miracle.

A Christmas miracle.

Judith, can I just say
that this was the best Christmas ever.

Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

'Twas the night before Christmas
And all through the house

Not a creature was stirring...

Okay, just so we're clear,
you're only doing this to piss off my mom?

Do you have a problem with that?

No, that makes it better.

.......... ********** ..........

I had a great dream last night.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I dreamed I got locked in a house made of
doughnuts and I had to eat my way out.

Interesting. I had a similar dream,
only no house and no doughnuts.

- Morning.
Morning.

Morning.

So, uh, how'd everybody sleep?

Uncle Charlie and
I both had dreams about eating.

Mine was with doughnuts,
his was something dirty.

He's just guessing.

Good guess.

And, yes, Alan, we see your earring.

Pretty cool, right?

Yeah, if you're going to a Wham! Concert
with Molly Ringwald.

- I think it's cool.
- Thank you, Jake.

- Can I get my ear pierced?
- No.

- Why not?
- You can't keep the holes you have clean.

And you're too young.

Wait till you're old, desperate
and living in your brother's house.

You can mock me all you want, but there's
a certain lady who thinks it's darn sexy.

First of all,
I don't need permission to mock you.

But more importantly, you let some broad
talk you into piercing your ear?

Actually,
my ear wasn't her first choice to pierce.

What else can you pierce?

Nothing.

Fine, don't tell me. I'll Google it.

Don't worry. He can't spell pierce.

He can't spell Google.

So who's Princess Poke-a-Hole?

Oh, just a nice young woman
with a sewing needle and a potato.

A potato?

Yeah. She put it behind my lobe,
sort of like a pincushion.

Oh. So you're a moron.

It's perfectly safe.
She sterilized the needle.

- How?
- With alcohol.

Okay, KahlÃ»a.

Well, I guess I owe morons an apology.

You do know that's the gay ear.

What?

Left ear says,
"I'm a hipster from the disco era."

Right ear says, "Let's disco."

No, no, that can't be right.

Okay, don't believe me.

Hey, look who's finally out of the closet.

- Berta?
- Yeah?

- What are you doing?
- Making your bed.

Well, I'd like to take a nap.

Hop in. You can spoon me,
but it ends there.

- Are you sick?
- Yeah, I'm sick.

I'm sick of staying up all night
with a screaming baby...

...while my daughter's out trolling the
waterfront for the father of her next one.

Whoa, that's rough.

Oh, don't feign interest in my life,
Charlie.

Sorry, I... I see a woman in my bed,
I instinctively start lying.

Close the door on your way out.

Okay.

No. No, this is ridiculous.

- Berta...
Get out.

Sleep tight.

Hello? Ow!

Ooh...

Uh, hello?

Oh. Oh, hi.
Uh, no, no, it's just a little tender.

I'm glad you called. I missed you too.

Yeah, yeah, last night was fun. Ha, ha.

You won't believe who's in my bed.

Hang on.

I never do...

...but I'm on the phone right now.

Ow! Aah.

Damn it.

Uh, listen, how about tonight?

Oh, great, great. The usual place?

I will see you then.

Okay. Bye-bye.

Berta's in my bed.

Really?

Couldn't you just
pay her in cash this week?

Ow!

There are some things
we don't joke about.

Okay, so why is Berta in your bed?

Apparently, her daughter's
been out partying every night...

...and Berta's been stuck with the baby.
- Oh.

That's gotta be rough.

Don't feign interest in her life, Alan.

Sorry. Oh, hey, hey, listen,
can you watch Jake tonight?

Why, you wanna see if your new lady friend
can infect other parts of your body?

It's not infected. A certain amount
of swelling is perfectly normal.

Where'd it say that, Alan,
on the potato?

You at least gonna tell me
who this woman is?

It's nobody you know.

Oh. So I know her.

- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

Now, let's see. Who do I know that
you'd like to keep a secret?

- You're wasting your time.
- One of your ex-wives?

- Ha, ha.
- Rose? Berta's daughter?

Berta's daughter? Ha-ha-ha.

No, don't... Don't be ridiculous.

Ha-ha-ha.

That's rich. Ha, ha.

I'm tired. Shouldn't I be in bed?

Shut up and deal.

Look, I'll give you back the money I won.

You didn't win it till we stop playing.
Now deal.

- What's he doing up?
- Not now, Alan.

I'm all in.

- Jake, bed.
- Hold on, Dad.

Call you. Pocket aces.

- What do you got?
- You heard your father, go to bed.

Been betting on garbage all night.

You let a 12-year-old beat you at poker?

He's 12 and a half.

What's going on with your ear, Dumbo?

It's just a little swelling. It's normal.

Better pierce the other one. You don't
wanna be flying around in circles.

It's fine. Listen, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

If you don't see a doctor soon,
it'll be your earlobe.

- Are you gonna listen or what?
- Sorry. I'm all ears.

No, wait, that's you.

- You know what, forget about it.
- No, no, no. Come on. Talk to me.

- It's about the girl I'm dating.
- Berta's daughter.

How did you know?

Your idiot son doesn't have a single tell,
but you I can read like a stop sign.

Okay. I was gonna build up
to a big reveal, but...

Just cut to the chase.

You remember how I had a little crush on
Naomi when she was pregnant?

A little crush? You were like
a monkey trying to hump a watermelon.

- Are you gonna let me tell the story?
- I'm just fact-checking.

- Go ahead.
- Anyway, after she had the baby...

...we stayed in touch
and I got to know her and the baby...

...and I'm starting to care about
both of them.

Oh, buddy, you got a heart
as big as your ear.

But you're falling
into the same trap you always do.

- What's that?
- You're a pathological rescuer.

Ever since you were a kid,
bringing home that stray three-legged cat.

Oh, yeah, Tippy.

Finding the sick baby bird, feeding it with
an eyedropper, nursing it back to health.

Until Tippy ate it.

And it's the same thing with women.

You constantly seek out these damaged,
needy broads.

You know, you're right.

Maybe subconsciously, I'm hoping that
if I save them, they'll love me.

Perhaps. Or subconsciously, you realize
the only way an emotionally healthy...

...self-supporting woman would
pick you up is on a scavenger hunt.

But we digress.

Please, continue
with your star-crossed love story.

Well, Naomi and I have been
sneaking around behind Berta's back...

...and I'm starting to feel guilty about it.

You want my advice?

Live with the guilt and see a doctor
before that thing grows teeth.

Don't you think the honorable thing
would be to tell Berta?

Sure, honorable is one way to go.
But may I remind you...

...that this is a woman who's been known
to lift the stove with one hand...

...in order to beat a mouse to death
with the other.

How much honor you think
that little fella had?

Oh, well, now you're being silly. I mean,
Berta's not gonna physically assault me.

I hope you're right.

I've grown to enjoy these little talks.

Why don't you just pay me
what you owe me?

I don't owe you till we're done.

Now throw the dice.

Oh, you just suck.

I wouldn't need a job if
I joined the Army.

- You can't join the Army.
- Why not?

Because you already are
all that you can be.

You remember my little burden, Naomi?

Oh, sure, I remember her. Hi.

She's got job interviews this afternoon.
I'm gonna watch the baby.

How are you gonna work
and watch the baby?

Who said I was gonna work?

Hey, Alan. Look who's here.

- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

- Um, Nancy, right?
- Uh, Naomi.

Naomi. Naomi, sure. Ha.

- Been a long time.
- Sure has.

- This must be your baby. Oh, isn't she cute.
- Oh, thanks.

And there's the proud grandma.

Look at her beaming.

Well, dip me in butter
and roll me in nuts.

I, too, am shocked.

So you're the sleazeball
she's been running around with.

Oh, Alan, how could you?

No, it's my fault, Mom.
Alan wanted to tell you.

No, no, it's my responsibility.
If you're gonna do anything, do it to me.

Welcome to the family!

Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

I made you breakfast.

- Really?
- Need to have your morning tinkle first?

No, I'm okay.

Good. I made all your favorites.

Scrambled egg whites, turkey bacon,
rye toast, no butter, decaf coffee.

Well, thank you.

You eat like a 90-year-old man
with stomach cancer, but I don't judge.

So, what do you and my little girl
have planned for today?

Maybe a romantic walk on the beach?

A cozy picnic?
I could pack you a lunch.

- Uh, gee, Berta, I don't really...
- Or how about this:

I'll watch the baby and the two of you can
spend the afternoon in bed getting sticky.

Well, uh, as lovely as that sounds, I wasn't
really planning on seeing Naomi today.

Why not? What's wrong? Oh, please
don't tell me there's something wrong.

I mean, you ain't much,
but you're the best she ever had.

No, no, no. Nothing's wrong.
I just... I have to go to work today.

Oh. Ha, ha.

- Right. Silly me.
- Ah.

Naomi never dated anybody
with a job before.

At least not one that's indoors and legal.

I understand.

Well, you let me know if you need anything.

- I will.
- Ironing? Groceries?

I could lance that ear for you.

Uh, no, thanks.

I know what I'm doing. I spent a summer
castrating sheep in Montana.

- I'll keep that in mind, but I think it's fine.
- Okay.

You made an old lady very happy, Alan.

I'm... glad.

Bye-bye now.

Bye-bye.

Oh, I am so screwed.

- Charlie?
I'm in the bathroom, Alan.

Um, I've got kind of a delicate problem.

The antibiotics are in my dresser drawer.

No, no, it's Berta.
She's being ridiculously nice to me.

I'm afraid what might happen
if I break up with her daughter.

Oh, you can't break up
with her daughter.

What do you mean,
I can't break up with her?

Well, I guess you could, but:

So, what am I supposed to do?
Marry Naomi just to keep Berta happy?

You don't have to marry her, just let
the relationship follow its natural course.

Natural course?

Think about it, Alan. Any woman,
given enough time, will grow to loathe you.

My God, you're right.

So I just have to stick it out with Naomi
until she hates my guts.

How long could it take?

Damn it, Charlie,
get your lazy ass out of that bed.

Hello, bright eyes.

- Hi.
- I bagged you a lunch to take to work.

- No kidding?
- Yeah.

I also tossed in a packet of vitamin E.

Help you chalk up the old pool cue
for Naomi.

- Thanks.
- Come here, give me some sugar.

Mwah.

Oh, you are so screwed.

Here you go.

One hot chocolate
for the lactating mommy.

Thank you.

I see little Brittany Pam
is having the grande boobaccino.

Yeah, and she's biting the straw.

Listen, you got any plans
for Saturday night?

I don't think so. Why?

Well, my mom wants to have
a big family dinner over at her place.

Family? Uh, whose family?

You know, me, you, Jake, Charlie,
my mom, your mom.

Oh, oh.

Well, uh, that sounds like fun.

- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

Unfortunately, I'm busy this Saturday.

- But you just said...
- I misspoke.

Oh, I get it. I'm not good enough
to meet your mother.

Oh, no, no, no. I'm just...
Uh, I'm concerned about the baby.

- Why?
- Oh, boy. Uh...

...I was hoping
I wouldn't have to tell you this...

...but my mother
feeds on the souls of the young.

- Okay, just forget it.
- Oh, come on, Naomi.

I mean, don't you think a family dinner
is pushing things a little too fast?

Too fast? You weren't worried about
going too fast on our first date...

...when you chewed through
my nursing bra.

In my defense,
I didn't know about the flaps.

You know,
I thought that you were different.

I am different. Ask anybody.
They'll tell you, "Alans different."

No. No, no, you're not.
You're just like all the rest.

Flirtsy, squirtsy and then arrivederci.

- Naomi, I didn't mean to...
- I'm not that kind of girl anymore.

I am a mama now
and I demand to be treated with respect.

Sweetie, sweetie, calm down.
I do respect you.

I just thought that the dinner
was a little premature.

Premature? You weren't worried about
being premature on our first date...

...when you ruined
a perfectly good sweater.

You know what? Saturday's fine.
Dinner sounds great. We'll be there.

Yeah, damn right, you'll be there.

What? You never seen
a screaming woman with a bare boob?

This is just mortifying.

- Mom.
- It's one thing to diddle the help, Alan.

It's another thing to dine with them.

- Jake, are you listening to your iPod?
- No.

Well, start.

Naomi is not the help.

Oh, forgive me.
She's the maid's round-heeled daughter.

I mean, I'd expect this from Charlie.
He'd hump a grilled cheese sandwich.

- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, darling.

And what, pray,
is going on with your ear?

Oh, it's fine.

Looks like a cherry tomato.

His lady friend thinks it's "darn sexy."

Don't worry. You won't be the only one
at the table tonight with a raging infection.

It's not infected.

It's got a pulse, Alan.

Look, Mom, there is no reason
to look down your nose at Naomi.

She and her mom are decent,
hard-working, salt-of-the-earth people.

Well, pardon me.

You know,
it's tacky to arrive empty-handed.

Perhaps we should stop and pick up a box
of wine or some aerosol cheese.

Oh, Mom, you're on fire tonight.

It's the new meds.
They mix well with liquor.

Oh, this was a bad idea.

Charlie, didn't you tell him
that's the gay ear?

This is nice flatware.

I gave the same pattern to Charlie
for his birthday.

Yeah, he gave it to me.

Next year, he wants a roasting pan.

You gave away my flatware?

To be fair, Mom, I gave it to you.

So, Berta. Nice house.
When do we take the tour?

- Have you been to the can yet?
- Yeah.

You took it.

Okay.

I wanna make a toast.

Oh, good, a reason to drink.

To Naomi and Alan.

Thank God they found each other.

Let's face it,
they were both running out of options.

- Hear, hear.
- Hang on, hang on.

I'd like to propose an addendum
to the toast.

A subordinate clause, if you will.

Uh, while Naomi and I are enjoying
each other's company...

...we are proceeding in a very slow
and cautious manner.

Except when we're having sex.

Time and place, Naomi. Time and place.

Yeah, well, I wish you'd spend a little
more time and aim for the right place.

Oh, God, just kill me now.

- Jake?
- IPod?

Attaboy.

Excuse me. Uh...

I'd like to say a few words
before we fold up the dining-room table...

...and commence the square dancing.

Alan, you're my son and I love you.

But you and I are through.

- What?
- I just can't bear it anymore.

I have to cut you loose.

Is that all it takes?
Hey, Berta, you got any other daughters?

Naomi? Are you in there?

- Hector?
- Go away! Nobody's home!

Mom.

If that loser steps one foot inside
this house, I'm getting out my nail gun.

Oh, wonderful, we're going to be
on an episode of Cops.

- What are you doing here?
- I've come to see my daughter.

- Is that her?
- What do you care?

- You ran off.
- I didn't run off.

I couldn't get back across the border.

They're cracking down
because of these damn Arabs.

Oh. Why didn't you call me?

I did call. Didn't your mother
give you my messages?

Whoops.

- Oh, Hector, I've missed you so much. Oh.
- I missed you too.

- Alan.
- Yeah?

Your relationship has run
its natural course.

She doesn't hate me yet.
She's just, like...

A toast to Hector and Naomi.

- May their love last forever.
- Hear, hear.

What's with your ear?

I'm gay.

Berta?

Don't bother me, Charlie,
I had a hard night.

If you're so tired,
why don't you just stay home?

Are you kidding?

Hector invited his entire family over
to see the baby.

It's like the Alamo over there.

Well, for the record,
I didn't get any sleep either.

Halfway home, Alans ear blew up and
we had to take him to the emergency room.

- Is he okay?
- Yeah, they were able to save the lobe...

...but I don't think anyone's gonna call it
the gay ear anymore.

Huh.

Well, sweet dreams.

You too.

.......... ********** ..........

- I have a question.
- Yeah?

How smart do you have to be
to have sex?

- Well, actually...
- Nah, nah, nah!

- Can I, uh...?
- Nah, nah, nah!

- But I was...
- Nah, nah, nah!

- Oh, come on...
- Nah, nah, nah!

Why do you ask?

- Well, Mom's boyfriend's a doctor.
Yeah.

And doctors are supposed
to be smart, right?

Not as smart as they think they are,
but, uh, go ahead.

Well, when I'm in bed
I can hear them in bed.

- Oh, God.
- Oh, boy.

Oh, goodie.

And Mom's always telling him
that he doesn't know what he's doing.

How much do I love this kid?

Don't interrupt, Charlie.
Go on, sweetheart.

So I'm thinking sex must be
a lot harder than I figured.

I mean, she has to tell him
the same thing every night.

- Every night, you say?
- Berta.

You had a semi-annual subscription,
didn't you?

Come on, you guys. Please?

Can't help you.
- Sorry, no.

Look, Jake, it's not that you have to be
particularly smart to have sex.

Yeah, look at your dad.

Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

Think of it this way.

- Suppose you like banana cream pie.
- I do like banana cream pie.

- Well, good.
- Do we have any?

- No.
- Well, then why did you bring it up?

I was trying to tell you about sex.

What does pie have to do with sex?

- Can I jump in?
- No, no, no!

- How about me?
- Excuse me, if I can't talk, you can't talk.

Am I right, Alan?

Anyway, if you don't tell me
you like banana cream pie...

...and I keep bringing something else...
- But I just told you I like it.

You wanna know what kind of pie
your uncle Charlie likes?

- Oh, come on, I wasn't...
- Nah, nah, nah!

- I'm guessing cherry.
- Nah, nah, nah!

Please, I've got this.

You've got squat.

At this rate, the kid's only gonna get
a stiffy at Marie Callender's.

Okay, okay, forget the pie.

Uncle Charlie said "stiffy."

Yeah, I heard him.

My point is, you don't have to worry about
being smart enough to have sex, okay?

Okay.

In fact, there are times when brains
and imagination are a distinct disadvantage.

Like when you've been
married for 12 years...

...and you're only allowed to do
the same three things over and over again...

...in exactly the same way
and exactly the same order...

...like you're some kind of unthinking
machine or a trained freaking monkey.

Okay, honestly, how much more damage
could we have caused?

I bet monkeys like banana cream pie.

- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

- What's in the box?
- Banana cream pie.

You bought him a whole pie?

I bought him two pies.

Why would you do that?

It seemed easier than explaining to him...

...that his mother's fiancÃ©
isn't really a sexual moron.

- Oh, hey, Alan.
Herb.

Uh, why is Jake eating pie
in the bathroom?

Not now. Not now.
What are you talking about?

Jake can hear you two in bed.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

He didn't hear that.

Um, what did he say to you?

Well, uh, basically, he's worried
that when he grows up...

...he won't be smart enough to have sex.

Why would he think that?

He hears you giving Herb instructions
like he's a blind guy in a minefield.

You think that's funny?

No.

- Well, I will talk to him.
- No, no.

Trust me, talking only makes it worse.
Charlie and I tried.

- Great, Charlie knows about this?
- That's not the point, Judith.

The point is,
you need to be a little less vocal.

Maybe do what you did with me...

...and smack him on the head
when he goes off course.

She does that too.

Well, um, thank you, Alan.
I will take care of this.

- I'm sorry to dump this on you.
- Oh, that's okay.

I mean, you know, I'm not judging.
I've been in your position.

Well, she only likes the one.

Yeah, yeah. Been there, done that.

Or, ahh, more correctly, been there,
told I was doing that wrong.

Truth is, I, uh, kind of like the instructions.
It takes out all the guesswork.

- Sure, sure.
- I tend to meander when I don't have...

...you know, a game plan.

Well, that's, uh, never a problem
with Judith.

She's the, uh, Vince Lombardi
of sexual intercourse.

She did teach me
to play through the pain.

Yeah, tape it up and get back in there.

Say goodbye, Herb.

- Bye.
- Bye.

- Hey.
- Hey, how did it go with Judith?

It was the most awkward
and uncomfortable conversation...

...I've had in my life.

Huh. More awkward than when you were
a kid and had to explain to Mom...

...why you were hiding a slab
of raw liver in your sock drawer?

Okay, the second most awkward.

What about when she found the warm
cantaloupe with a face drawn on it?

All right, it was in the top five.

I mean, it's just unnatural for a guy
to have to tell his ex-wife...

...to pipe down while she's having sex
with another man.

I'll tell you what's unnatural.
The look on that melors face.

Fruit should not look surprised.

- You're the one who gave me that idea.
- I was joking.

You told me it's what the astronauts do.

Oh, right.

That's how I got you to pee
in the Tang jar.

And let's not forget how I convinced you
Mom's douchebag was your air supply.

Yeah, yeah, my breath smelled
like vinegar for two weeks.

Aw, those were innocent times.

Oh, the kitchen appliances
are a little outdated...

...but you people can cook
with your wristwatches now, can't you?

You're funny. You're a funny firecracker.

- Mom?
- Oh, Charlie, say hello to Hiroshi Goto.

Hi.
- Hello.

Uh, Charlie is my number one son.

Yeah, but she treats me like number two.

Oh.

- Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Of course, darling.

Uh, Hiroshi, why don't you go enjoy
the view from the deck.

There's pretty girls playing volleyball
out on the beach.

Oh, I like volleyball.

Here's what you need to know.

He's filthy rich
and looking for a house on the beach...

...and I have nothing to show him.

So you're selling him my house?

Don't worry, I told him you were
going through an ugly divorce.

But before we close escrow,
you'll reconcile with Cheryl...

...and back out of the sale.

Who's Cheryl?

She is a sweet, selfless girl
who worked nights...

...to put you through law school
while you were sleeping with her sister.

I have to string Mr. Goto along
until I have something to show him...

...that actually is for sale.

Oh, I understand.

It's called a bait and switch,
and it's a felony.

Oh, well, look at you
taking the moral high ground.

And with nary a bottle
nor a whore in sight.

Bravo.

Excuse me, why is there
an Asian man on the deck?

- Mom's selling my house.
- Why?

Marital problems.

You cheating bastard.

- Do I have to find another place to live?
- Yes.

Don't worry, sweetheart.
Mommy's just running a little scam.

But feel free to find another place to live.

Anyway, what's new?
How's my grandson?

- Oh, he's fine.
- Oh, come on, Alan, tell her about the pie.

- What pie?
- There's no pie.

- Jake overheard his mother...
- Nah, nah, nah!

It's nothing.

I just had to have a rather embarrassing
conversation with Judith yesterday.

More embarrassing
than when you were 11 years old...

...and I caught you with the dog
and peanut butter?

You went and did that too?

You told me it's what the cowboys did
on a cattle drive.

And I didn't have a cow.

- Is that why you got rid of our dog?
- I couldn't look at him anymore.

Can we move on, please?

I'm sorry, dear. Now, what about Jake?

I loved that dog.

Well, not as much as your brother did.

But go ahead, Alan.
What did you have to talk to Judith about?

Nothing. Forget it.

Oh, come on, Alan.

The dog whisperer here
got all bent out of shape...

...because Jake heard his mother
going at it with her boyfriend.

That's it? He just heard them?

- That's not enough to traumatize him?
- Absolutely not.

- See, Alan, I told you.
- Well, you would know, Charlie.

What do you mean?

- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

Nothing.

I like it.

Of course you do.

Let me show you the master suite.

That's where she caught him.

Ah, cheating bastard.

What am I supposed to remember?

I was the only one that gave that dog
any kind of attention.

No.

I remember.

Charlie?

Yeah.

What are you doing?

Drinking.

Why are you doing it here?

I can't be alone right now.

Okay.

What's going on?

I remembered, Alan.

Remembered what?

I was 8 years old.

It was late at night.

I must've had a bad dream or something
because I walked into Mom's room...

...and I saw them.

Saw who?

Mom and some guy.

They didn't hear me at first, because
the waterbed was making sloshing noises.

At least I hope it was the waterbed.

Oh, yeah.

Mom's waterbed. Remember how we used
to bounce up and down on it...

...playing lumberjack and doing the...?
- Forget the bed. The bed's not important.

Sorry.

Anyway...

...at some point
they realized I was standing there...

...and the guy said to me:

"Don't worry, Speed Racer.
I'm not hurting your mom."

Speed Racer?

Remember I had
the Speed Racer pajamas?

Oh, yeah, yeah, our Christmas pajamas.

Yeah, you got Speed Racer
and I got Laverne & Shirley.

- So typical. I...
- This is not about you, Alan.

This is about a horrible moment in my life
that I completely repressed.

Mom and the man
with the big red mustache.

Oh, God.

I just realized why Yosemite Sam
always made me nauseous.

- And I'll tell you the worst part.
- Worse than Laverne & Shirley pajamas?

- Alan.
- I am amazed I'm not a raging queen.

We all are.

Anyway, the next morning,
I asked Mom what happened...

...and she said she didn't know what I was
talking about. And when I kept asking...

...she threw a shoe at my head.
- Oh, yeah.

Yeah, the 4-inch heels.
Oh, she was deadly accurate with those.

She could knock a melon out of your hands
from clear across the room.

Will you get your mind out of the produce
section? I've got a problem here.

Come on, Charlie, it happened years ago
and you turned out...

Yeah, you got a problem.

Thank you.

I gotta tell you, it does help me
feel better about Jake.

I mean, you know,
he didn't see anything...

...and at least we haven't been lying
to him about having sex.

No, no, you just taught him
to associate sex with pie.

Hey, at least I didn't talk him into putting
crotchless panties on a Butterball turkey.

Oh, right.

Best Thanksgiving ever.

You told me it's how the Pilgrims
got through the harsh winter.

He's gotta be asleep by now.

He could wake up.

So we'll be quiet.

I can't be quiet.

Come on, please?

Oh, all right.

No, no, not that way.

Slow down.

I'm still awake.

Are you happy?
I may never be happy again.

Mm, pie.

Rose, did you ever suddenly remember
something that you blocked out years ago?

You mean like a repressed memory?

Yeah, you ever had a repressed memory?

I forget.

Get it? Little psychology humor.
Freud was the first one to use it.

- Ha.
- It's much funnier in German.

So, what memory did you repress?

When I was 8...

...I walked in on my mother having sex.
- Interesting.

Interesting? How about devastating,
horrifying, traumatizing?

Wow.

What, was she, like, blindfolded
and tied to a bed...

...while two guys slapped her butt
with Ping-Pong paddles?

No.

Hmm.

Was she riding around on a goat
while an albino midget dripped honey...

No, no.

No.

It was just sex. One mother, one man.

Boring.

Oh, come on, Charlie.
It's not an uncommon occurrence.

I myself have walked in on
many people having sex.

Accidentally?

My point is, you've recovered the memory
and now you can get on with your life.

No, I can't.

What if it's not
the only repressed memory?

What else is lying just below the surface
ready to burst into my consciousness?

Am I gonna wake up remembering my
mother in the shower with my uncle Donald?

Who I suddenly realize
wasn't really my uncle.

Sounds like you don't have
to worry anymore.

Oh, God, it's all coming back.

Uncle Donald, Uncle Steve.

Uncle Jorge.

I bet I wasn't related
to any of those guys.

This is all good, Charlie. Keep going.

- Oh, boy.
- What?

Not only was Aunt Wendy not my aunt...

...but there was no snake bite
on her boob.

Oh, hey, what are you doing here?

Uh, well, we were hoping that...
Actually I was hoping that, ahh, maybe...

He wants me to stay here tonight
so he and Mom can have sex.

Oh, Jake, I'm sure that's not the reason,
right, Herb?

No, that's pretty much it.

Excuse me.

Where are you going?

To tell Mom that her indiscriminate
bed-hopping has scarred me for life.

Jury's still out on me.

What do you want?

We need to talk.

You should have called first.
I'm a little under the weather.

Yeah, well, I'm not feeling so great myself.
I've started remembering things.

Well, call the poor girls,
apologize and stop drinking so much.

No, I'm remembering things about you.

Things from my childhood.

Wait, what are you doing?

You can't even look at me, can you?

I don't care what you think
you remember.

I was a terrific mother who loved you
even though you were a horrible boy.

Now go away.

Mom, this is important.

Mom?

You ruined Yosemite Sam for me.

Dagnabbit, this isn't over.

Oh, God.

Charlie.

Don't worry, slugger.
I'm not hurting your mother.

Whoa!

- Okay, I gotta go if I'm gonna catch my bus.
- Good night, Berta.

Hey, Dad, guess what I found
in Mom's bedroom.

You know what, I'll take a cab.

An empty can of whipped cream.

Whipped cream. No kidding.

And you know what I'm thinking?

- I know what I'm thinking.
- Nah, nah, nah!

What?

Either whipped cream has to do with sex,
or Mom hides pie in her nightstand too.

Hey, a gal can do both.

Nah, nah, nah!

Hey.

- Hey, what happened to you?
- What are you talking about?

- I thought you went to Mom's.
- No.

Then where were you?

- I don't remember.
- What do you mean, you don't remember?

It's called a repressed memory.
Now drop it.

Any one of you lily-livered, bowlegged
varmints care to slap leather with me?

I'm the hootingest, tootingest,
shootingest...

...bobtailed wildcat in the West.

I'm the fastest gun north, south,
east and west of the Pecos.

.......... ********** ..........

You're taking advantage of me
because I'm drunk, aren't you?

- Yeah, I'm a bad girl.
- Lucky for both of us, I don't judge.

It's not my fault.
Whose fault is it?

I told you. Uncle Charlie.
- I thought you lived alone.

I do. I leave the Tv on to deter criminals.

Charlie, did you tell Jake
he could use your computer?

Just take what you want
and don't hurt us.

- Go ahead, tell him, Uncle Charlie.
- No one's talking to you.

Can you explain to me
why I caught him watching a movie...

...called Vanessa Does Van Nuys?

Hey, meet Vanessa.
Why don't you hop upstairs?

- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

- Hey, Dad, can we move to van Nuys?
- No.

- Hey, whose skateboard?
- Mine.

- Wow, it's really rad.
- Thanks. So's your movie.

Thanks. We're working on a sequel.

Yeah, I'm gonna do Woodland Hills next.

- Hippety-hop, hop, hop.
- Oh, right.

- Can we move to Woodland Hills?
- Forget Woodland Hills.

What the hell is your skateboard doing
on the stairs?

We're talking about the dirty movie
on your computer.

I'm sorry. I forgot it was on there.

You can't forget
when you have a child in the house.

- I'm not a child.
- And I don't have him.

No one's talking to you,
and that's no excuse.

Look, it's not hard-core.

It's mostly her and a couple friends
having a pajama party.

- I didn't see pajamas.
- Shut up. Go away.

Again, I am sorry, mea culpa.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
"mea" going upstairs...

...for a "culpa" hours.

Hey, Charlie, who do I work for...

...you or this fastidious parasite
you call a brother?

I get the feeling you want me to say me.

Me, definitely me. She works for me.

Then tell her when something
is on the shopping list...

...she should, in fact, shop for it.

I'm gonna slug him. Can I slug him?

- Why are you making such a big deal?
- It is a big deal.

- It's not.
The hell it isn't.

- What is going on here?
- It's very simple.

I have decided
to start drinking acidophilus milk.

It promotes intestinal flora,
which aids in healthy digestion.

Anyway, for three weeks,
I have been writing it on the shopping list...

...yet Berta insists
on bringing home 2-percent.

Slug him.

This is my life. Milk and skateboards.

It's a good thing I'm drunk.

"Salted butter. " Salted butter.

"Extra-large eggs. " Extra-large eggs.

"Acidophilus milk."
Two-percent milk, you whiny pinead.

- Morning.
- Hey, how you feeling?

- Not too bad, really.
- That was some fall you took.

Yeah, if I hadn't been plastered,
it might have killed me.

You'd think the liquor industry
would promote that.

It is a selling point.

Right up there
with making ugly people doable.

Ah.

Two-percent, the king of milk.

He's gotta go, Charlie.

What am I gonna do, Berta?
He's my brother.

We could make it look like an accident.

No. No accidents.

As long as my mother's alive,
nothing happens to Fredo.

Hi.

Hello.

I am sorry to bother you.
I'm just moving in next door.

- Really?
- Mm-hm.

- You're my new neighbor?
- Mm.

Thank you, God.

Anyway, I just wanted to stop by
and introduce myself.

- Danielle Stewart.
- Charlie Harper.

- Nice to meet you, Danielle. Come on in.
- Oh, thank you.

We'll have
a "welcome to the neighborhood" drink.

It's 9 a.m.

Oh, right. Pfft. Who drinks at 9 a.m.?

I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.

- Ah. Great.
- All right.

- Oh, Berta.
What?

My faithful housekeeper. Ahem.

Would you be so kind as to bring
a cup of coffee for our new neighbor?

Sure. Luckiest SOB on the planet.

- Please.
- Oh. Thank you.

So, Danielle, what brings you
to our little stretch of paradise?

Me? Well, I just got tired
of the cold winters in Chicago.

Well, I don't wanna scare you away,
but winters here...

...the mercury can dip down
to the mid-60s.

- Oh, no. How will I stay warm?
- I recommend the buddy system.

- You're cute.
- I know.

So, what did you do in Chicago?

Uh, well, for the last eight years...

...I've had a full-time career
trying to spend my divorce settlement.

Oh. A working woman.

Buying a Malibu beach house ought to take
a chunk out of that settlement.

Yeah, you'd think.

Whoa.

Anyway, I've had my fun.

I wanna settle down,
get serious with my life.

Oh, yeah. Me too.

No kidding? So are you married? Ha.

Me? Uh, no.

You looking to get married? Ha, ha.

Uh...

No.

Do you like children?

Uh...

No.

Ha, ha. So how do you define
"getting serious with your life"?

Well, I've stopped drinking
in the morning.

- Hey, Berta. Ahem. Where's that coffee?
- You men are all alike.

Isn't there anyone left...

...who just wants to get married
and raise a family?

Yeah, but they're all gay.

- Here we go.
- Oh, thank you. Oh, uh...

...you wouldn't happen
to have any acidophilus milk, would you?

Walk me through this again.

She's beautiful, rich, divorced...

...and you wanna hand her off
to Zippy the Chimp?

Okay. Follow my reasoning here.

This is a woman
looking to settle down.

If I sleep with her,
I'm happy for one night.

But if I teach my brother
to sleep with her...

...he falls in love,
asks her to marry him, moves out...

...and I'm happy for the rest of my life.

- It's a nice plan, but it'll never happen.
- Don't... Don't... Don't say that.

- Unjinx, unjinx, unjinx.
- Charlie, she is way out of his league.

Pfft. I know that.
Everybody's out of his league.

He doesn't even have a league.

He's just a kid with a bat and a ball
and a football helmet.

- But luckily, he has me.
- Color me dubious.

I'm home.

Come on, I need you to be with me
on this one.

It'll never work.

This... is acidophilus milk.

It is on the shelf below the 2-percent,
right next to the low-fat yogurt.

Boy, does your brother
have a girl for you.

- What?
- She just moved next door.

She's gorgeous, divorced and loaded.

Uh-huh. What's wrong with her?

Why does something have to be wrong
with her?

Because there's only two reasons
you ever set me up with a woman:

You either need somebody
to keep the emotionally disturbed...

...or cross-eyed
or hermaphroditic best friend busy...

...while you do the pretty girl, or...

okay, I guess there's just one reason.

There is nothing wrong with Danielle.

- Berta, is she or is she not gorgeous?
- Hey, I'd do her.

If she's so great, why give her to me?

- You want the truth?
- It'd be a nice change of pace.

All right, first of all...

...I am sorry
about the hermaphroditic incident.

"I'm sorry" does not make up for leaving me
in a hotel room...

...with a girl who had a vestigial penis.

I didn't know.
I was as surprised as you were.

Charlie, no one was as surprised as I was.

But let's move on.

Okay, now, I'm not saying I didn't try
to hit on our new neighbor, because I did.

- And?
- I got nowhere.

She saw him for the mindless
meat-seeking missile that he is.

Anyway, I just thought
you two might hit it off.

I'm even making a little welcome basket
for you to give to her, see?

So she's beautiful, rich and single.

- Right.
- Why would she want me?

What kind of thing is that to say?
Why wouldn't she want you?

I'm broke, middle-aged, twice divorced,
sleeping on your Hide-A-Bed...

...and sharing custody of a flatulent,
underachieving son.

We're gonna need a bigger basket.

You're gonna need chloroform
and a rope.

Just remember, the most important thing
is to project confidence.

Got it. How do I look?

Just project confidence.

- Here, you give her the welcome basket.
- All right. Well, what do I say?

- "Welcome."
- Oh, good. That's good.

- Oh, hi. Heh.
- Welcome.

Uh, thanks. Ha, ha.

Danielle, this is my brother, Alan.
Alan, Danielle.

Alan just wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

Welcome.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Would you like to come in?

- I don't know, she seems kind of busy.
- Go, go, go.

- I am sorry that the place is such a mess.
- Don't be silly.

Moving takes time, right, Alan?

Oh, yes, uh, I remember the last time
I moved, it was very time-consuming.

I had to collect boxes
and those packing peanuts.

- Boy, those things get everywhere.
- Yeah.

Hey, that's summer sausage, not salami.
A lot of people confuse the two.

Ha, ha. Interesting. Heh.

Ahem. So why don't I, uh, open up this
wine and we can toast to my new home?

- Good idea.
- None for me. Red wine makes me gassy.

Sorry, I don't have anything else to offer.
I haven't had time to go shopping.

Well, then you must be starving.
We should take this young lady to dinner.

But I was planning on warming up
the pot roast from Sunday night.

- The pot roast will keep.
- I don't know, it's right on the edge.

Forget the pot roast.
So, what do you say?

We could walk up the beach to Georgio's
and grab a bite.

That sounds wonderful.
Let me throw on some clean clothes.

- Terrific.
- All right, I will be right back.

Ah, ah?

- She's incredible.
- Incredible, my ass. She's perfect.

Okay. A couple of pointers. Ahem.

- First off, you never open with gassy.
- I know.

- I know that. It just came out.
- It's all right, it's all right.

- No permanent damage.
- Mm.

Now, what's gonna happen here...

...is I'm gonna bail on dinner
so you two can be alone.

Really?
Because Georgio's is kind of pricey.

Ah, jeez. Here.

- Tip big. Don't agonize over the math.
- I don't agonize.

I just take the sales tax and double it,
which is roughly 15 percent.

Unless the service is less than impeccable,
in which case, I leave a flat $5.

Alan, it's my money, go crazy.

Fine. Eighteen percent it is.

Now, dinner conversation.

Don't talk about your boring job,
your petty problems, or your stupid hobbies.

What else is there?

Her. Her petty problems,
her stupid hobbies.

No woman ever came home from a date...

...complaining that all she did
was talk about herself.

Oh, that's good.
And that way, I remain an enigma.

Yeah, let's call you an enigma.

Alrighty. So do I look okay?

You look beautiful, fantastic. Right, Alan?

Welcome.

Okay, ahem, let's go.

All right, let me just lock up.

- Oh, no.
- What do you mean, you have to go?

I mean, uh, what's wrong?

I just remembered
I have some work I need to do.

Oh, no.

Oh, what a shame.
Maybe we should do this another time.

- No, no.
- No, no.

- You go ahead, enjoy yourselves.
- Are you sure?

- He's sure. Let's go.
- Okay. See you later, Charlie.

So, Danielle, you got any hobbies
or problems?

Yes, I know she's hot.

But I'm thinking long-term, so shut up.

- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

Stuck in traffic.
Danielle's coming over in a few minutes.

- Gotta shower and change.
- Wow, you two are going out again?

What can I say, Charlie?
The girl digs my mojo.

When did you get mojo?

Scoff if you like,
but that woman is entranced...

...by the enigma
that is Alan Jerome Harper.

- Unbelievable. Your plan is working.
- Told you.

- There's something wrong with that girl.
- There must be a lot wrong with that girl.

Well, then it's a match made in heaven.
There's something wrong with her.

We know there's something wrong
with him.

Yeah, and before you know it,
he'll move out, they'll get married...

...and we'll be wondering what's wrong
with their kids.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Danielle. Come on in.

- Thank you.
- Oh, man.

If the kid wants to kill me,
why doesn't he just cut my brake line?

- Alans in the shower.
- Am I too early?

No, no.
No, he's been living here for three years.

- You want a drink?
- Uh, no, thank you.

- I'm trying to cut down.
- Really? Why?

- Long story.
- Alan takes long showers.

- Longer when he's not dating.
- Thank you, Berta.

So tell me your story.

- Oh, it's a little embarrassing.
- Hey, all the good drinking stories are.

After partying at the Pomona State Fair,
I once woke up on a Tilt-A-Whirl...

...wearing nothing but a grass skirt
and a tiny sombrero.

- No kidding? Ha, ha.
- I've still got the sombrero.

Okay, your turn.

Oh. All right. Um...

The reason
my marriage didn't work out...

...the reason
none of my relationships work out...

...is because
I tend to drink a little too much...

...and then do things I regret.

- And by "things" you mean...?
- Men.

Huh.

And the occasional woman.

Huh.

Well, as stories go,
I'd say this is a good one.

At least yours doesn't end with
a toothless carny offering you a churro.

You know,
I had a feeling you'd understand.

You know, Alan is very sweet.

But the guys I usually go for
are more like...

...well, you.

Huh.

Anyway, I think I am ready for a nice,
normal relationship.

No more getting blitzed...

...and falling into bed
with the first guy who asks me.

Or girl. Or couple.

Huh.

Huh, huh, huh.

Excuse me.

Okay, new plan.

I'm gonna boink Danielle
and Alans gonna live here forever.

Oh.

- Hello.
- It's not your night, Alan.

- What?
- Danielle. She's not right for you.

- But you said she was perfect for me.
- I was wrong.

She's sick and twisted.
That makes her perfect for me.

- I'm sorry, I'm not following.
- I was talking to her out there.

And it turns out she's a boozehound
and a sex freak.

What? I haven't seen that in her at all.

I mean, I got a good-night kiss...

...but she was perfectly sober
and her tongue did nothing freaky.

That's because
she's trying to hide who she really is.

- And who's that?
- Me. She's me, Alan, top to bottom.

Except, you know, from here to here.

So, what is it you want me to do?

Step aside so you can lead her
back to a life of sordid degradation?

- If you wouldn't mind.
- No, no, no. You gave her to me.

- There's no takebacks.
- All right, fine.

- We'll just let her make her own decision.
- All right, all right. May the better man win.

You should probably be rooting
for the shriveled man.

- Now, now, just a little. Ha.
- You got it.

- That is a beautiful dress.
- Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.

- Whoops.
- Ooh. Ha, ha.

- Sorry.
- Ha. That's okay. Ha, ha.

Mm, mm.

Buttery, with a slight citrus finish.

Hmm.

Ahh.

So you know wine.

Okay, Danielle, we'd better get going
if we're gonna make our reservation.

You're right. Thanks for the wine, Charlie.

Whoa, what's the hurry?
I was gonna make a pitcher of margaritas.

- Oh. I love margaritas.
- I'll be right back.

Gee, Danielle, do you really wanna sit here
and drink with Charlie?

Oh.

You know what? You're right, Alan.
You're a nice guy. You're good for me.

- Okay. Charlie, we're leaving.
Wait, wait, wait.

If you don't have time for margaritas,
I could mix one up in your mouth.

- Cut it out. I know what you're trying to do.
- What?

- I'm being a good host.
- You're taking advantage of Danielle.

- No, I respect Danielle for who she is.
So do I.

No, no, you respect Danielle
for who she's pretending to be.

I don't get you.
Why did you bother putting us together?

Because I thought she was dull
and boring like you.

And I had hoped the two of you would go
and be dull and boring at her house.

That was really your plan? That's insane.

It would've worked
if she wasn't a drunken slut.

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

There is no need to fight over me.

Alan, you're a sweet, gentle guy.

Charlie, you're a pig.

But I find you very attractive.

There's only one reasonable solution.
I'll have to do you both.

No crossing swords.

Are you out of your mind?
You're...? You're actually considering this?

Yeah, you're right.
I don't even like eating dinner next to you.

Uh, thank you for your generous offer,
but I'm afraid we must decline.

But mostly, he's afraid.

Ah, should've known.
Not a pair between you.

All right, well,
if either of you change your mind...

...you know where to find me.

Okay, you can have her.

"One pound salted butter."

"One dozen extra-large eggs."

"And one acidophilus milk
for the whiny pinead."

I thought I was the only one
who drank this stuff.

What?

Ha, ha. Are you kidding me?
It's all I drink.

You know, for the intestinal fauna.

That's all you drink?

Well, I've been known
to add a few fingers of vodka.

Kind of an "acidophi-tini."

- You're cute.
- So I've been told.

I can't.
I promised Berta I'd get the groceries.

You're right.

You're always right.

.......... ********** ..........

Hey.

Hey, you're back early.
How was your date?

I hate electric cars.

I don't like scented candles.

- Once again, how was your date?
- It was fine...

...until her estranged husband silently pulled
into the driveway in his freaking Prius.

If he hadn't stepped on the cat,
I'd be dead now.

- What are you doing?
- Me?

Uh, nothing. Just, uh, nothing.

You were surfing for porn, weren't you?

Uh... Uh, yes, okay.
That's what I was doing.

You caught me. I am so embarrassed.

Well, you should be. It's disgusting.

Come on, let's see what puts
a chubby in your chinos.

Oh, no, no, no. It's personal.

- What are you into, grannies with trannies?
- No.

Chickens with strap-ons?

Please, please don't, Charlie, plea...

oh, you pitiful freak.

- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, I came upon it by accident.

I am so ashamed.

My own brother using
an Internet dating service.

I'm a man, Charlie. I have needs.

Okay, name three contributions
that the Roman Empire made to civilization.

- Um, Roman numerals.
- Good.

- Aqueducts.
- Terrific.

Do you know what an aqueduct is?

- Uh, something to do with water.
- And?

A duck?

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Morning, Charlie.
- Morning, Rose.

What's going on?

She's helping Yertle the Turtle
study for his test.

Why didn't he ask me?

Name three contributions
the Roman Empire made to civilization.

Orgies, wine and bulimia.

Go ahead, ask me about the Greeks.

Then who did invent aromatherapy?

- Not the Romans.
- But you see my logic.

You know, I never did understand
why you didn't give her more of a chance.

She's pretty, smart,
and amazingly patient with dumb guys.

Are you talking about Jake or me?

A smart guy wouldn't have
to ask that question.

Excuse me, but let's not forget
this is a woman who stalked me...

...who spied on me,
who snuck into my house...

...to write her name
and address in my underwear.

Oh, boo-hoo.
Somebody cares about Charlie.

Nobody ever wrote their name
in my underwear.

Wait, once.
The Department of Corrections.

Good morning.

Morning.
- Hey.

Oh, hey, guys.
How's the homework coming?

The three major buildings in ancient Rome
were the Colosseum, the Forum and...

- Circus.
...Circus Circus.

- We need a little more time.
- Carry on.

I know it's not Caesars Palace.

Why don't you get him a real tutor?

Are you kidding? She has
advanced degrees in, like, three subjects.

She loves him. He worships her.
The only thing she asks in return is...

...to sit naked in your laundry hamper
once in a while.

And that's not a red flag for you?

- You could do a lot worse than Rose.
- I have done a lot worse.

But that's not really a recommendation,
now, is it?

The second triumvirate was Augustus,
Mark Antony and Lepidus.

Very good.

Okay. Well, that's it for today.

- Wait a minute.
- Oh, right.

Open up.

Mm, cookie.

Hey, Charlie, you got a minute?

I'd like to talk to you privately.

Now is not a good time, Rose.

Will you call me later?

- Sure.
- Promise?

- Yeah.
- Cross your heart and hope to die?

- Yes.
- Stick a needle in your eye?

- Okay.
- Boil in oil until you fry?

Dear God, Rose, I will call you.

Tootles.

You're not gonna call her, are you?

No, I think I'm gonna go
with the needle in the eye.

You didn't mention
in your dating profile...

...you've got hair growing out
of all your holes.

Hey, what are you doing with my laptop?

Just learning a little about you.
Spinemaster278.

I see you like smooth jazz,
long walks on the beach and cuddling.

- Give me that.
- Hold on.

This is my favorite part.

"I love to spend quiet weekends
puttering around my Malibu beach house."

Educate me, Alan.

To what Malibu beach house
are you referring?

- I was gonna tell you about that.
- Do you have one that I don't know about?

- No, no.
- Because if you do...

...one of us should be living there.

- Are you gonna let me explain or not?
- What's to explain?

You have a Malibu beach house
and you're the "chiropractor to the stars."

Okay, what do you want me to call myself,
chiropractor to fat people in the valley?

- Everybody exaggerates on these things.
- Okay, I can understand that.

You're probably not gonna get
responses to:

"Bushy-nosed cheapskate
enjoys long walks to a free meal."

Exactly.

- Hey, you're going out tonight, aren't you?
- Why?

Well, I met a woman on this dating site
and she's here...

...and it would be good if you weren't.

You're throwing me out of my own house?

Ah, well, no, if you read the profile,
it's my house.

See?

Coming. Be right there.
Please play along.

- You're gonna play along, right?
- Guess we'll find out together, won't we?

Alan, hi.

Beverly, it's so great
to finally meet you in person.

Hi.

Hello.

Oh, uh, this is Charlie.

Oh, right, your poor brother.

Hi, Charlie. How are you?

Mm. You smell nice.

Okay, okay, come on in. Ha, ha.

Oh, my. What a beautiful home.

Thank you.

I encourage him
to think of this place as his own.

Yeah, that way, I don't feel like
such a worthless parasite.

Charlie, weren't you going out tonight?

Gee, I'd love to, but you know me,
flat broke again.

Oh, well, I suppose
I could float you a few bucks.

- What do you need?
- Four hundred dollars.

Okay, okay.

You know, I'll just give you
everything I have.

That's... 31, 32.... $33.

What about the secret compartment?

Oh, right. Ha.

That would be $133.

And I don't expect
to see you again tonight.

Thanks, bro.

Be nice to him. He's all I've got.

- Sorry about that.
- I understand.

I have a sister who's a crack whore.

Really? Maybe we can introduce them.

For $133, we can introduce them twice.

Terrific.

- Well, here we are.
- We sure are.

I guess you've noticed
I'm a little taller than 5'9".

Well, yeah, but everybody fudges
a little on those dating profiles.

- How tall are you?
- 5' 13".

Leanne, tell me something.

Is it just me or is the crowd in here
getting younger?

No, the crowd's the same age
it's always been.

You, on the other hand, are not.

I'm not old. Forty is the new 30, right?

Ha-ha-ha. Not the way you live, pal.

Yeah, well, guess what.
Not tipping is the new tipping.

I gotta do more drinking at home.

You didn't call.

- Did you follow me here?
- Please.

If you're not home and you're not on a date,
where else would you be?

And, yes, I followed you here.

There's something I need to tell you.

- What can I get you?
- Grain alcohol, please.

We don't have grain alcohol.

Okay, uh, just a Sprite.

What do you want, Rose?

I don't want anything.
I just have some news to share with you.

Is this CNN kind of news...

...or something you heard from a friendly
blue jay with a top hat and a cane?

If you recall, that was a crow...

...and he was wearing
a derby and safety goggles.

And I've admitted
that was a medication issue.

Fine, whatever. What's the news?

Well, my family
has business interests in London...

...and I'm gonna move there
and take a job.

Oh, terrific. So will you be running
the chocolate factory?

Did the oompa-Loompas drop the ball?

- Charlie.
- Little bastards went union, didn't they?

Oh, I'm gonna miss
that good-natured cynicism.

You're probably wondering why
I decided to leave.

Actually, I was wondering
what possessed them to remake that movie.

Gene Wilder was perfect.

I'm leaving because
I'm not getting any younger...

...and our relationship isn't really
progressing along the path I'd hoped for.

Rose, there is no relationship.
There is no path.

How very Zen of you.

I'll always love you, Charlie.

But this is best for both of us.

Yeah, right.

Okay, well, have a good trip.
Say hi to the Queen...

...of Hearts.

- Is your friend leaving?
- No, no, she never leaves.

She's probably climbing
into the trunk of my car as we speak.

Maybe you should follow me home
to make sure I'm safe.

I don't think my husband would approve.

When did you get married?

Shortly after the last time
I woke up in your bed...

...with cab fare taped to my forehead.

I suddenly realized how empty
and soulless my life had become.

Thank you for that, by the way.

Happy to help.

How are you doing tonight?

Oh, gee, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have daddy issues.

And then a week before
we were gonna get married...

...he announces that he's leaving me
for the wedding planner.

- Ouch.
- I was heartsick. I really cared for him.

Of course.
Why else would you agree to marry him?

No, I mean the wedding planner.

Ouch.

Well, we all have one or two
heartbreaks in our life.

- Eight.
- Excuse me?

I've been dumped eight times.

Married, married, gay, parole violation,
gay and married, deported...

...returned to the priesthood,
and woman in a mans body.

Whoa.

- And yet you haven't given up.
- Of course not.

I may have to kiss a lot of frogs,
but eventually I'll find my prince.

Ribbit?

- I knew it. You're gay.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm not gay.

Whatever it is,
I don't have time or strength to deal.

Beverly, wait, wait.

Okay, you know my loser brother?

- I'm him.
- What?

This is Charlie's house.

Uh, after my divorce, I was broke
and he took me in.

And I'm not the chiropractor to the stars.

I mostly handle slip-and-fall
insurance claims.

- That's all?
- What do you mean, that's all?

I mean, married, married, gay,
parole violation. Alan, you're a catch.

- I am?
- Come on.

You're single, you're straight,
and you're a genetic male.

So I guess the bar's not that high.

Have you done much online dating?

You cleared it with a penis and a job.

And just to put your mind at ease,
I plan on keeping both of them.

Berta, you wanna hear something cool?

"The ancient Romans
had a place called a vomitorium...

...where people could eat as much as they
wanted, puke, and then eat some more."

Oh, just like the Sizzler.

- Hey, morning, buddy.
- You suck.

Whoa. Has the little prince
not taken his morning poop yet?

It's your fault that Rose is moving away.

Oh, did she tell you that?

Jake, she's not going anywhere.

This is one of her games
to mess with my head.

Berta, tell him.

Jake, honey...

...your Uncle Charlie sucks.

- Come on, you don't...
- If you weren't such a self-centered pud...

...you'd realize what an angel she is
and never let her go.

Okay, first of all, she's not an angel.

Second of all, she's not leaving...

...and third and perhaps
most important, pud?

I cleaned it up for the kid.

Love is lovelier
The ninth or tenth time around

Morning, everybody.

- What's going on?
- Rose is moving to London.

- She is? Why?
- Because Uncle Charlie's a pud.

- A pud?
- I cleaned it up for myself.

Hey, Dad, can we go to Sizzler?

- This is nice, huh?
- Yeah.

- Listen, can I tell you a little secret?
- Well, sure.

It's kind of embarrassing.

- Hey, you can tell me anything.
- All right.

Well, before I came over tonight...

...I put a toothbrush in my purse.

What's so embarrassing about that?
I don't go anywhere without floss.

In fact, sometimes
I'll snap off 18 inches...

...and tuck it in my pocket in case,
you know, I have a stubborn... oh.

You mean, you and me?

- Tonight?
- Unless you don't want to.

Want to?

I'm almost done.

You know, Alan,
I've been thinking about it.

Rose crossed the line when she told Jake
that crap about her moving away.

- Uh, yeah, listen...
- I mean, kids take that stuff seriously.

- I know...
- It's one thing to screw with me.

- It's another thing to screw with a child.
- No argument.

But this is a conversation
you need to have with her.

You're right.
I'm gonna settle this right now.

Rose? Climb up here!
I wanna talk to you!

Are you sure you're the loser brother?

That's always been the consensus.
Excuse me.

Come on, Rose, you crazy bitch!
I know you're out there!

- Uh, uh, Charlie?
- Do you want me to beg you to stay?

I hate to interrupt...

...but I'm making some real headway
in there and you're ruining the mood.

Not now, Alan.

I'm not gonna beg you
because you're not going anywhere.

I know and you know you're not leaving.

That lovely lady in there
brought her toothbrush...

...because I have a penis and a job.

Rose!

How is she gonna brush your job?

- No, you don't understand.
- I don't have time for this, Alan.

- Charlie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just can't find my damn stalker.

He can't find his stalker?

They're usually in the last place you look.

But enough about him.

If you will accompany me
to the boudoir...

...I will convert an ordinary pull-out couch
into a magic carpet for two.

Are you sure you're not gay?

I'm literate and urbane.
You're not the first one to be confused.

Right address.

Oh, Charlie, you came to say goodbye.

Unbelievable.

You're gonna play this
all the way out to the end.

- Play what out?
- All right, fine. We'll do it your way.

Rose, you're a terrific woman.

I'm an idiot for not seeing it
and I really don't want you to leave.

- Really?
- Yeah. Here, look.

Wow.

- See?
- Oh, yeah.

Well, that's my cab.

- Goodbye.
- Wait, wait.

- Wait, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

Don't you understand?
You can drop the act.

I give up. I surrender.

You win, Rose. I'm yours.

Oh, Charlie, that's so sweet.

But I know you.
You're just having a little panic attack...

...because you're getting old
and nobody loves you.

See, you get me.

I do, which is why I have to leave.

Goodbye, Charlie.

Oh.

I almost forgot.

I thought you should have this.

It's our first restraining order.

Look how shaky your signature was.

You were so spooked.

Oh.

Got a plane to catch.

Oh, come on, Rose.

Stop it.

All right, fine. Take your little cab ride.

See you tomorrow.

Okay.

Maybe not tomorrow.

Oh, damn.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, hi.

- Where's Alan?
- In the bedroom.

- I have to get up early for work.
- Right, well.

- See you.
- Bye.

Hey, Beverly?

I'm really glad you and Alan got together.
It's nice.

Thank you.

I hope things work out for you
and your stalker.

Her name is Rose. Like the flower.

Okey-dokey.

See, it's on our restraining order.

Uh-huh. Good night now.

- Hey, Alan?
Uh, I'm not decent.

- Rose is really gone.
What?

I said, Rose is gone.

And I feel awful.

Maybe I made a huge mistake.

Well, we all make mistakes.

.......... ********** ..........

Good morning, Charlie.

Charlie?

Good, I don't have to give him
mouth-to-mouth.

- Morning.
Morning.

- He's sleeping?
- Sure, let's call it sleep.

Uncle Charlie, I'm gonna have a bowl
of Maple Loops, you want one?

Are you sure he's okay?

I never said he was okay.

Freaky.

You really shouldn't see him
like this, Jake.

There, now you can
enjoy your breakfast.

- What's wrong with him?
- Oh, he's getting old, kiddo.

I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

He was like Babe Ruth.

He played baseball?

No, he was a drunken whoremonger.

But there was none better.

Oh, God, look what the cat dragged in.

He didn't just drag it.

He ate it, pooped it out
and then covered it with sand.

You know what would be funny?

To paint a big mustache on him.

That would be hilarious, but no.

Charlie?

Charlie?

Yeah?

Are you okay?

Yeah.

What time did you get home?

I'm home?

You are.

Oh, God, I'm blind.

It's a miracle.

Okay, see you tomorrow.

Good night, Berta.

Hey.

Look who's finally up.

How'd you sleep?

Okay, I guess.

Good, I'm glad.

- Oh. Tater Tots.
- Help yourself.

- Jake, I said no.
- I didn't do it.

He didn't.

What are you staring at?

Nothing, seÃ±or.

So how are you feeling?

That depends. What day is it?

Saturday.

Oh. Well, in that case, I feel great.

Why in that case?

If it was Thursday, I'd be a little worried.

I don't know,
you've been pushing it hard lately.

- What do you mean?
- You're not a kid anymore.

Oh, please.

I'm in the best shape of my life.

Oh, that doesn't belong inside of me.

It takes a lot to gross me out, but wow.

Get your stuff together.
I'll bring you back to your mom's.

Let me tell you something.

You're only as young
as the women you feel.

And lately, I've been feeling about 24.

- Twenty-four?
- Yup.

She doesn't think I'm old.
She thinks I'm cute and fun.

- And rich.
- Yeah, the rich helps.

I'm not that cute.

Okay, fine. I understand the allure,
the nectar of the young berry.

I know what happens
burning a candle at both ends.

How would you know that? Did you take a
candle-making class at the Learning Annex?

Hey, I have done my share
of walking on the wild side.

The wild side?

Okay, the rambunctious side.

There comes a time in a mans life when
he has to start accepting his limitations.

Yeah, well, my point is,
the day you start accepting limitations...

...is the day you start dying.

And I'm not dying, my friend,
I am living life to the fullest.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go throw up and take a nap.

That was fun.

- Yeah.
- How long until you're ready to go again?

You mean, tonight?

Oh, yeah, I forgot.

You're old.

Hey, hey, hey, I'm not old.

I'm just not a yogurt dispenser.

You're almost as old as my dad.

All right, listen, if you're looking to
go again, that's not the way to get there.

Aw. Did I hurt your feelings?

No, no, you didn't hurt my feelings.

It's just there are certain biological
factors you have to take into account...

Yeah, my dad takes viagra.

Good for him.

All I'm saying is, we could do something
else for a while and come back to this.

- Great. Let's go to a club.
- Now?

It's 11:00.

So we'll get there early.

Actually I was thinking
more along the lines...

...of making some toaster pizzas
and watching The Daily Show.

- Oh.
- What?

I'm bored.

If we're not gonna have sex, you know,
I wanna go out.

Okay, tell you what...

...why don't you go out and,
you know, boogie oogie oogie?

And when you come back,
wake me up and we'll have sex.

That's a lame idea, Charlie.

Okay, you can skip
the waking-me-up part.

- I'm just gonna go call some friends.
- No, no, no, wait.

Come here. Come here.

I think I'm ready to go again.

- Really?
- Really.

I got nothing. Let's go dancing.

Yeah, I'm coming with the guy
I told you about. The old guy.

I don't know. I think he's got
a little brother who's old too.

I'll ask him. Great, we'll see you there.

Think your brother would wanna come?

Alan? No, he's not the type.

He'd be miserable going to a club
at this hour.

Wait here. I'll go get him.

- Hey.
- Oh, you just missed it.

Jon Stewart made a very clever joke
about the budget deficit.

Swell.
Get dressed. We're going dancing.

Yeah, right. Toaster pizza?

No. Come on. Let's go.

- Are you serious?
- Yes.

But it's after 11 and I'm all tucked in.

- Too bad.
- I'm drinking Nighty-Night tea.

Come on. Robin wants to go dancing
and I'm gonna need a designated driver.

Hey, just because you're being a fool
trying to keep up with a 24-year-old girl...

...doesn't mean I have to join you.
- She has a 24-year-old friend.

Is it dressy-dressy or dressy-casual?

Just take it. Maybe it'll loosen you up.

I don't think so.

Recent studies indicate that Ecstasy
may well deplete your spinal fluid.

Yeah, so?

So? Young lady, I am a chiropractor.

Whoo.

You know what?
My date isn't working out.

Maybe you'd get somewhere
if you didn't talk to her like her father.

Well, somebody has to because her real
father has obviously dropped the ball.

Oh, wonderful, a smoker.

So I guess you're counting on stem-cell
research to replace your spine and lungs.

Alan, Alan, you're embarrassing me.

Oh, I'm embarrassing you?
Look at yourself.

You're standing in line in a dank alley
in the middle of the Urine District.

Hey, hey, hey,
this is the hippest club in town.

Oh, hip, schmip.
It's a toilet with a doorman.

Somebody lit a doobie.

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
That is definitely the ganja.

Oh, great,
now we're all gonna get busted.

Will you just relax
and let yourself have some fun?

Oh, this is fun for you?

Exhaust fumes and reefer smoke?

Let me tell you something.
I am not a kid.

I need plenty of rest, exercise
and a high-fiber diet and...

oh, perfect, I just stepped on a condom.

Go ahead. Have a good time.

- Hold it.
- We're with them.

- I don't think so.
- Oh, no, no. We are.

Truth be told, I don't see a long-term
relationship in the offing. You understand.

Don't touch the rope.

Sorry.

I didn't realize you were king of the rope.

Shut up, Alan.

You're not on the list,
you're not getting in.

- You let the girls in.
- Alan...

He let the girls in.

That's because pretty girls
dress up the place.

Watch how this works.

Listen, why don't you check your list
for Jackson?

Andrew Jackson.

Nope. Got Tito and La Toya.

Okay.

What if I change my name to...

...Ulysses S. Grant?

You could change your name
to Condoleezza Rice.

If you're not on the list and you're not
a celebrity, you're not getting in.

All right, look, I didn't wanna have
to play this card but I'm Charlie Harper.

I'm in the music business.

I wrote the Maple Loops jingle.

Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?

- Oh, I love those cookies.
- Great.

- You got any on you?
- No.

Beat it.

Charlie, Charlie, let me handle this.

Sir...

...I am Matthew Broderick.

Who?

Bruno, they're with me.

Are you sure?
This is a good chance to cut them loose.

Guys, come on.

Matthew Broderick is a gifted actor
and the toast of Broadway.

Oh, for God's sake,
will you stop complaining?

Well, I'm sorry, but the music in that club
was so loud, my ears are still ringing.

You know what that sound is? That is
the sound of the hairs in my ear dying.

I am talking permanent hearing loss,
Charlie.

Those little hairs don't grow back.

Oh, wait. Let's see something.

C- sharp.

C- sharp is the sound
of encroaching deafness.

Listen to you. You're like an old man.

I can't listen to me. All I hear is:

Worst night of my life.

You're just ticked off
because you couldn't keep up.

I couldn't keep up?

I was out on the dance floor with the girls,
while you were sleeping in the booth.

I wasn't sleeping.

I was closing my eyes because
I couldn't bear to watch you do this:

I was voguing.

You were napping.

Nobody vogues anymore, Alan.

And guess what,
nobody does the robot anymore either.

Oh, yeah? Then why
did it catch on with the others?

It didn't catch on.
They were openly mocking you.

What do you want from me?

I went to the club.
I went to the after-hours club.

I went out to breakfast.

I held my date's hair while she vomited
pancakes in the parking lot.

If you weren't whining
about wanting to go home...

...you'd be having sex with her
right now.

Oh, darn. What man doesn't dream
of kissing secondhand pancakes?

And I have to go to work.

You know what? You are a fuddy-duddy.

I'm...? I'm a fuddy-duddy?

Hey, if the orthopedic shoe fits, wear it.

They are not orthopedic.

They merely have a reinforced arch
for the active lifestyle.

And you were napping.

Okay, maybe I needed a little shuteye.

But that's only because
I had vigorous sex earlier.

Oh, let's face it.
We're both too old for the MTV lifestyle.

MTV? Did they just defrost you?

Okay. MTV, VH1,
whatever the kids are watching.

My point is,
I am comfortable acting my age...

...while you are in deep denial.

Hey, hey,
I am not in denial about anything.

I am a young, vibrant man
in the prime of my life. I'm...

What?

Young people have phlegm too.

Sure.

Anyway, as I was...

oh, God.

What's the matter?

My chest.

Are you okay?

I don't know.

- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah.

Do you think it's too late
to start jogging?

Damn it, what kind of hospital
is this? Where the hell are the doctors?

That's my brother in there.

If he dies, I'm homeless.

Uh, everything's fine.

Uh, they're just gonna run some tests.
Not to worry.

Easy for you to say.

Listen, Alan.

If I don't make it,
you need to know about my will.

Hey, I don't wanna hear that kind of talk.
You're gonna make it.

But go on. Finish what you were saying.

First of all,
I left the house to you and Jake.

Yes!

You're gonna make it.

Just so you know,
there's two mortgages on it...

...and the property taxes
are $50,000 a year.

Uh, 50,000?

Uh, excuse me.

Do you gotta flatline
to get a little help around here?

Do you gotta move to Canada
to get some decent medical care?

Uh, they'll be right here.

So 50 grand, huh?

Boy, I don't know
how I could afford that.

You know,
unless I came into some money.

You know, an ineritance or something.

There's no money, Alan.

None?

The whole thing's a house of cards.

Huh.

Okay, I did not wanna have to do this...

...but I am Matthew Broderick.

And that is my brother lying there.

I am so sorry, Mr. Broderick.

- I loved you in The Producers.
Thank you.

Okay, let's have a look-see, huh?

According to your tests, you just had
an acute attack of indigestion.

- It was gas?
- Yes. A big bubble.

About the size of a pomegranate.

What have you had to eat recently?

Nothing much.

He had Belgian waffles,
link sausages, two Red Bulls...

...a quart of Scotch
and the tongue of a 24-year-old actress.

He asked what I ate, Alan.

And I told him, Charlie.

Oh-ho, you're a dirty bird.

Well, the good news is that you are
a perfectly healthy 50-year-old man.

I'm only 40.

Tell that to your liver.

I would recommend you slow down a bit.

- I've been saying the same thing.
- And you.

Why no sequel to Ferris Bueller, huh?

I wait and I wait.

I'm sorry, I'll get on it.

Ah, give the people what they want.

So gas.

Good news, huh?

- A little embarrassing, but yeah.
- What are you embarrassed about?

I don't know.
The paramedics, the ambulance...

...the crying and the last-minute
negotiations with God.

Oh, right. Are you still planning
on teaching piano to orphans?

If any show up, sure.

All right. Well, will you at least accept
the fact that you have to slow down?

Yeah. Yeah.

It's weird, Alan.

It seems like just yesterday, I could...

I could party all night,
eat and drink anything I wanted to.

Now a couple of Red Bulls and a waffle...

...and I'm sitting in the emergency room
praying for a fart.

Now you know why I ordered
tomato juice and cottage cheese.

- I admit, you take good care of yourself.
- I try.

I guess that's why I keep you around.

Because I'm a good example?

No, you clod, spare parts.

What are we watching?

Antiques Roadshow.

This woman thinks she has
Martha Washingtors butter churn.

Huh.

Toaster pizza?

Thank you.

- So are you going out tonight?
- Ah, what's the point?

Look, Charlie,
I'm glad you're slowing down a bit...

...but you haven't been out of the house
in a week.

Ah, it's too depressing.

Wherever I go,
I'm the oldest guy in the room.

Even here.

Hey, what would you think
about getting a cat?

Okay, that's it. Put some clothes on.

We're going out.

It's 9:00.

I was gonna make some kettle corn.

Forget the corn. You're coming with me.

- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

Can you drive?

I don't like to drive at night.

What the hell is this place?

- The fountain of youth.
- What?

Follow me.

Ooh, look, young stuff.

Alan, you're a genius.

- May I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

How old are you?

I just turned 40.

Ah! You're a baby.

Well, yeah.

Hey, I have a little riddle for you.

All right.

What has multiple orgasms and hums?

I give up.

Oh.

Come on, I'll show you.

Alan? Alan, I'm leaving.

And may God bless you.

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, Charlie, would you see who that is?

It's Death.

Hi, Mom.

Your gardener left this in the driveway.

That was no gardener,
it was a girl with a grudge.

- So how was your friend's funeral?
- Oh, terribly disappointing.

Yeah, in my experience, nothing kills a party
like a dead broad in a box.

Don't be glib, Charlie.

- Hello, Alan.
Oh, hey, Mom.

Wow, you look nice.

Yes, mourning becomes me, doesn't it?

If only more of my friends would die.

I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

Charlie, as long as you're over there,
make Mommy a drink.

It's been a very depressing afternoon.

Thanks for spreading it around.

Can you believe two of Cynthia's
three children...

...didn't even bother showing up
at her funeral?

And the one who did was drunk
and cracking tasteless jokes...

...about his mother
all throughout the service.

You didn't happen to jot any of them down,
did you?

And it wasn't just the children.

The crowd was very sparse
and there was virtually no mourning.

That's understandable.
You said no one liked this woman.

Oh, she was a hateful shrew, but still...

Fortunately, I was able to draw
on my theater background...

...and work up a good cry.

Sense memory.

I remember the time I wasn't cast
as Blanche DuBois in Streetcar.

You're a good friend, Mom.

I know. I'm just glad
that when my time comes...

...I won't have
such a humiliating sendoff.

Right?

- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. Sendoff. Yes.

Well, I'm gonna go freshen up.

Even fake tears can ruin one's mascara.

Whoever did Cynthia's makeup
should be shot and buried beside her.

She looked like a varnished clown.

You'll go to Mom's funeral, won't you?

Of course.

As the eldest son,
it's my obligation to pound in the stake.

Typical. Nothing for Alan to do.

Okay, you can cut off her head
and hold it up for the villagers.

What are you doing?

Leaving before Mom gets out
of the bathroom.

- I thought we were taking her to dinner.
- I can't listen to her anymore.

It blows my mind that she can go on and on
about her toxic friend's sad little funeral...

...when we both know she gonna end up
the same way.

I don't disagree, but there's an option
to running away from her.

Yeah, but we'd get caught and
you'd sell me out for a reduced sentence.

We could tell her the truth.
That she's just as toxic as her late friend...

...and that that's the way
she's gonna be remembered.

Are you on crack?

Maybe if she realized how people see her,
she might make an effort to change.

If she realized how people see her,
she'd just get new people.

- Charlie, I...
- What are we gonna say, Alan?

"You're a crazy she-bat and the only way
people will come to your funeral...

...is if your delighted sons turn it into
a three-day beer bash with go-go dancers.

Well, we wouldn't start there.

All right, Cynthia's in the ground...

...my face is on,
I look stunning in black...

...let's go to dinner.

Hey, just follow my lead.

- Mom?
- Yes, dear.

Alan thinks you're a crazy she-bat and
no one will mourn at your funeral either.

We're telling you this
because we love you.

I see.

Look, Mom, you have to realize
that you're not that different from Cynthia.

I most certainly am.

Oh, come on, Mom. You speak ill
of everyone, even your closest friends.

You manipulate people.
You're an unbelievable narcissist.

- You're self-obsessed...
- That's a bit redundant, isn't it?

You find fault with everything.

And, frankly, I don't know anyone
who enjoys spending time with you...

...let alone would cry at your funeral.

That's one point of view.

Charlie, I notice
you haven't said anything.

Actually, "crazy she-bat" was mine.

Again, Mom, we're only telling you this
because we care about you.

Right, Charlie? We care about you.

And it's not too late for you to change...

...and become the kind of person
that people would dearly miss.

When you're dead.

- You've given me a lot to think about.
- Yes, and while you're thinking...

...remember the spirit
in which it was intended.

Oh, I won't forget that.

Good, good.

Listen, I think I'm gonna beg off dinner
tonight.

Good, good. Aw.

Goodbye, boys.

Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

- Okay.
- Okay?

What's okay?
What do you see that's okay?

Well, we got out of dinner.

Yes, but at what cost?

Sure, her feelings are hurt right now,
but that'll pass in time...

...and then she'll see this as an opportunity
to grow and change.

Do you actually believe that?

I have to, Charlie.

I have to.

Yo, mad props on the sandwich, Dad.

This PB and J is off the hook.

- Excuse me?
- He's been watching MTV Cribs.

The kid's a sponge.

For shizzle, my dizzle.

Hey, MC Skid Mark.

Here's something else
you left in your pants.

- Oh, right. I was supposed to mail this.
- What is it?

It's a birthday card Mom gave me
to send to Grandma.

Oh, God. Today's Mom's birthday.

You forgot Mom's birthday?

Did you remember it?

Hey, hey, no one expects me
to remember anything.

- When's the last time you talked?
- I don't know.

When we told her
she's horrible and nobody likes her.

Oh, yeah. That was a fun day.

- Guess I could save this for next year.
- No, no, no. You'll give it to her in person.

We'll go buy her a present,
then bring it to her.

Gee, Alan, she hasn't talked to us
in weeks.

Don't you think showing up with a gift
might jeopardize that?

If we don't,
we'll never hear the end of it.

True dat.

You tell them, Poop Dogg.

Yo, check out the bling.

Jake, I'm not gonna tell you again.

You're a pasty white kid.
Start acting like one.

Fine.

Oh, this is cool.

It does say, "Mom."

Charlie, be serious.
Jake, if you wanna help, find something...

...that's appropriate for your grandma.
- Like what?

See if they got a grizzly bear
ripping apart a salmon.

Hi there. May I help you find something?

Oh, yeah. We're looking for a birthday gift
for our mother.

Oh, how sweet. When's her birthday?

Today.

He forgot.

Well, tell me something about her.
What does she like?

Hurting people.

Charlie...

It's a little hard to answer that
because we have a strained relationship.

Oh, so you'd like to find a gift
that would help bring you closer together?

- No, no. No, no.
- Oh, no. No.

This is just your standard
family obligation...

...here it is, happy birthday,
stay-off-our-backs kind of thing.

But with a pretty bow.

I see. And what is your price range?

Enough that she can't complain,
but not so much...

...that it's worth her while to return it.
- Exactly.

Have you considered a nice perfume?

Do you know her scent?

- Oh, actually I don't.
- I do.

- You do?
- Yep.

Do you carry Chanel No. 666?

You know, I think I'm going to let
the two of you just browse a bit more...

...and I'll be back, maybe.

Great news.

It's on sale.

Now, remember,
this was not a last-minute thing.

Our plan all along was to surprise her.

I know how to lie, Dad.

We're not lying. We're being considerate.

By lying.

Happy birthday.

Oh, what a surprise.

That was the plan all along.

I don't know what to say.

After the last time we spoke,
I assumed that...

Come on, Mom.

No matter what, you're still our mother.
Right, Charlie? You're still our mother.

Give her her present, Jake.

- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

- Oh, it's heavy.
- It's just a bowl.

I wanted to get you a bear eating a fish.

But we got her a nice crystal bowl
instead.

- So can we come in?
- Actually, I'm having a little party.

- A party?
- And you didn't invite us?

Charles, if someone's not going to mourn
at my funeral...

...I certainly don't want them
at my birthday party.

Well, then who's here?

People who love me. People who care
about me and accept me for who I am.

Oh, I gotta see this.

Please come in.

Oh, hello.

Hi.

Charlie, Alan, Jake, I'd like you to meet
Roger and Philip and their son, Changpu.

These are my sons and grandson.

- Oh, hi.
- Nice to meet you.

Your mom is such an incredible woman.

- She's like the loving mother I never had.
- She's fabulous.

We're one big, happy family.

Son of a bitch. She got new people.

Who are these guys?

You're surprised I have friends?

You're surprised that I'm surprised?

Roger works in my real-estate office,
Philip does my hair.

And I introduced them.
They make a lovely couple, don't they?

Yeah, I guess.

And they adopted...

...Chung King?

Changpu. Yes, from China.

Of course, I had to help them a bit,
greasing the bureaucratic wheels.

- You bribed someone?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

I merely slept with a commie.

- Is this goose liver?
- It's quail pÃ¢tÃ© with endive.

- Philip's special recipe.
- Oh, you gotta give it to me.

Well, I'll trade you.
My recipe for your mother.

Done.

You are so lucky.
My mother is a bitch on wheels.

- Your mother? What about my mother?
- Fine, your mother's a bitch too.

Thank you.

So do you have a PlayStation or an Xbox?

I have a cello.

- What do you play on that?
- Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Shostakovich.

So no "Grand Theft Auto"?

Oh, this is a treat.

My boys, my boys. Thank you.

- Make a wish.
- Why? You're already here.

My wish has come true.

Who wishes for two gay guys
and a Chinese kid?

Oh, and now, Evy,
we have a very special present for you.

What do you think,
a bear eating a bear?

Changpu is going to perform
a cello concerto.

He wrote it himself in your honor.

How marvelous.

- Should I give her the card now?
- Forget about the card, Jake.

Shh, shh, shh. Shampoo is gonna play.

Don't feel bad.
I bet he can't burp the alphabet.

Well, that was one of the most
bizarre evenings I've ever spent.

- It was right up there.
- I thought it was fabulous.

You know what's happened, don't you?

- We've been replaced.
- Hey, fine with me.

As long as she's got Siegfried and Roy,
we don't have to deal with her.

It's fine with me too. I just can't believe
she conned these guys...

...into thinking she's a good witch.
- Well, we know she's not.

- You're damn right.
- You said it, sister.

Hey, SpongeBob GayPants, take a break.

You don't think
we might have been wrong about Mom.

- What?
- I'm just saying that Roger and Philip...

...obviously see something in her
that we don't.

Who knows her better? Us or them?

Oh, us. No question.

But maybe there's a part of her
we're missing.

Alan, there's a part of her she's missing.

It's called her soul.

Snap.

Hey, Mom, how are you?

Charlie, what a pleasant surprise.

Oh, I was just calling to say happy birthday
again and thanks for last night.

It was so nice to meet Philip and Roger...

...and Shanghai.

Changpu.

- And thank you for the lovely crystal bowl.
- Oh, good, you like it?

Like it? Well, I love it.

I'm admiring it right now.

Great, great.

- Listen, dear, I've really gotta go.
- No, wait, Mom.

I wanna clear the air about that stuff
that got said a couple of weeks ago.

What's that?

Well, I don't have any problems
with you being who you are.

That whole thing about you needing
to change, well, that's Alans deal.

- Oh, I knew that.
- Yeah.

The thing I love about
our relationship is...

...that you don't try to change me,
I don't try to change you.

We accept each other as, you know,
incapable of changing.

That is very sweet.

Okay, here you go.
Eggs Benedict, my own reci...

- Anything else?
- No, no, I guess not.

- Love you.
- You too. Bye-bye.

- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

You said there was something important
you wanted to talk to me about?

Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking about...

Mm. Mm.
Too much lemon juice in the sauce.

Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

You should ask Philip for his recipe.

- I will.
- You might also ask him who cuts his hair.

You don't have to be gay to look nice.

I'll ask.

Anyway, I just wanted to clear the air
about a few things.

Really? Like what?

Well, you know, that stuff that got said
a couple of weeks ago.

I just want you to know...

...it was Charlie's idea.

Oh, I knew that.

Yeah, I only went along because,
you know...

...he's the older brother...

...and he might have been drunk.

Well, I'm just glad one of my sons
cares about me.

I do. I love you, Mommy.

Right back at you.

Now skedaddle.
Philip and Roger will be here any minute.

Oh. Okay.

Oh, look, there they are.

Philip, Roger and Changpu.

No pictures of me or Jake.

Sweetheart, I've been asking
for a decent picture for years.

All I've ever gotten was a school photo
of Jake...

...where he appeared to be sucking
on his shirt.

Oh, yeah. They served spaghetti
on picture day.

Oh, hey, you know
what we should do?

We should get together
and take a nice family portrait.

- That sounds lovely.
- Great. I'll set it up.

- Terrific.
- Okay. Bye.

Bye-bye.

Did I tell you that I love you, Mommy?

Yes, but I never tire of hearing it.

Oh, well, in that case,
I love you, Mommy.

I really should have stopped drinking
during pregnancy.

- Hello?
- Hello.

- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

I couldn't help noticing
there's a photographer in the living room.

Oh, yeah, we're taking a family picture.

Family picture.

Would it be rude of me to point out
the obvious flaw in your plan?

- I didn't think you'd be interested.
- I'm not.

So it's just you and
Little Lord Scratch 'n Sniff?

Hey, if you don't sniff it,
you don't know what it is.

Actually, it's a picture
of me, Jake and Mom.

Mom? Mom who?

She said she didn't have
any good pictures of us.

Wait a minute,
when did you talk to Mom?

She called me.

You've been sucking up to her
behind my back, haven't you?

Charlie, you have no idea
how insane that sounds.

All I know is after everything
that's happened...

...I would never talk to her
without talking to you first.

- You wouldn't?
- What kind of person do you take me for?

I'd rather cut off my arm than pick up
the phone and try to undermine my brother.

Me too.

That's why I'm...

...taking a bullet here for the both of us.

Well, thanks.

You don't have to thank me.

I'm your brother.

Ooh. Mommy's here.

Might as well get this over with.

Wait a sec, hang on.

Let me go change.

- You actually wanna be in the picture?
No, no, no.

Are you kidding?

But it's not fair for you
to have to do it alone.

Oh. Well, thanks.

You don't have to thank me.
I'm your brother.

- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, dear.

- Mom, how are you? Good to see you.
- Hi, Charlie.

Oh, what a marvelous house.

- Adorable.
- Mom?

You said you wanted a family portrait.
They're family.

Okay, well, I'm going back to bed.

Charlie, what about the picture?

Put me down for a wallet size.

I just love what you're wearing.

- Like that?
- Yeah.

But what was all that crap
in the beginning?

Introduction of my own composition.

No offense, but "Smoke on the Water"
doesn't begin...

...with crap on the water.

My apologies.

Okay, let's take it from the top.
One, two, three, four.

The play date was a good idea.

Yeah, let's see
how Grandma likes her prodigy...

...after he sponges up our sponge.

.......... ********** ..........

Help me out here, doc,
I need a time of death.

Sorry, lieutenant, but I can't give you
an official TOD until I get her on the slab.

But based on hypostatic lividity...

...and degree of rigor...

...I'd say our cheerleader
got her pom-poms pierced...

...right around halftime.

- Real?
- Real.

Anything else?

Left-handed assailant,
used a single-edged blade.

Multiple entry wounds
and defensive trauma.

So how are we gonna find
this psychopath?

Well, like our killer,
we'll just have to take a stab at it.

That's it.

So you think I'll get the part?

Uh... Well, I, for one, totally buy you
as a brilliant forensic investigator.

Thanks.
But I believe it's pronounced "fornesic."

What do you think, Charlie?

Unbelievable.

Aww.

I mean, beyond belief.

That's sweet.

I mean, I just don't believe it.

You made your point, Charlie.

Do you like what I did with the glasses?

On smart, off hot.

My mind is just completely blown.

So when are you gonna be on Tv?

I have to pass the audition first.

Let's not put the can't before the whores.

- Horse.
- Ahem.

Maybe a little.
I've been rehearsing all day.

- What's the name of the show?
- Stiffs.

Stiffs?

You know, like dead bodies.

Oh, right. Sure.

I know what you were thinking.

Well, I'd better go.

The auditiors at 4
and I still have to get my tan sprayed on.

Best of luck.

It has nothing to do with luck, Alan.

You just have to stand still
and keep your eyes and mouth closed.

No, I... I meant... Never mind.

- Knock them dead at the audition.
- Thanks.

And thanks for lending me
your chiropractor coat.

It makes me feel like a real doctor.

Now you know why Alan wears it.

Okay, well, tell me how it goes.

I will.

Oh, and by the way,
did you get the divorce papers?

Not really
but my lawyer explained them to me. Bye.

They need to be signed.
Kandi?

Hey, what's your hurry?

If she becomes a big Tv star while you're
married, she'll have to pay you alimony.

Yeah, and if pigs start flying out
of my rear end...

...we'll have free bacon
for the rest of our lives.

I don't know that I'd eat that bacon.

Isn't anybody gonna get that?

- Jake?
Yeah?

- What are you doing?
- Hanging posters.

Did you consider using Scotch tape?

It doesn't hold as well. Especially her.

- Who is that?
- Raven.

She's the North American
ladies' wrestling champ.

Aha.

All oiled up and ready...

...to wrestle.

Damn it, this isn't funny.

Quick little bastards.

What happened
to your Harry Potter posters?

I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

You don't have to be a kid
to like Harry Potter.

You want it, take it.

Oh, Harry. You crumpled Harry.

- Do you remember when we got this?
- Nope.

Oh, come on.

We stood on line outside that bookstore
at midnight to get one of the first copies.

You were dressed as Harry
and I was Dumbledore.

Don't remember, Dad.

Sure you do.

You made fun of that kid
because he had a mop instead of a broom...

...and he started crying
and his father punched me in the chest?

No.

Yeah, well, you weren't the one
with the cracked rib.

Anyway, what...?
What prompted you to redecorate like this?

I don't know. I like cars and wrestling.

And wet T-shirts, apparently.

Oh, there is a wet T-shirt in that.
I hadn't noticed.

Hah!

Huh.

Jake's redecorating.

Yeah, I can see that.

Oh, Raven.

Those are fake, by the way.

Charlie?

What? He has a right to know.

I'm just glad the little guy's got me to...
Wait a minute.

Are those nails in my wall?

Are you out of your freaking mind?

- No.
- No?

That's your answer? No?

Yeah.

Charlie. Charlie, come on. Come on.

Oh, for God's sake,
these are railroad spikes.

I'll putty over it.

That's not plaster board, that's stucco.
You can't putty stucco.

- I know, I'll fix it. Let's give him privacy.
- All right, wait, wait, wait.

At least I can take one hammer
out of his hand.

Jake, look at Daddy. Look at Daddy.

Look at Daddy.

Ah. That's my boy. Wave at Daddy.
Yes, Daddy's over here.

Wasn't he adorable?

Yeah.

Hey, could you rewind to Judith
breast-feeding him?

That was really adorable.

Especially the part
where she does the old switcheroo.

I miss that little boy.

It seems like only yesterday,
I could hold him in one arm.

He didn't weigh
more than 8 or 9 pounds.

He craps more than that now.

Where did the time go?

I mean, his childhood is almost over...

...and there's still so much stuff
I wanna do with him.

- Like what?
- Well, you know, father-son stuff.

I mean, pretty soon, there'll be
no more playing catch or riding bikes.

Do you realize
I've never even taken him fishing...

...or camping or hunting?

Do you know how to fish
or camp or hunt?

That's not the point.

I thought we would learn together.

That's good.
You and knucklehead out in the woods...

...taking turns,
shooting each other in the ass.

Okay, it's not so much
about hunting per se.

Per se. There's an outdoorsy phrase.

It's about bonding.

Before you know it, he'll have no interest
in spending time with me at all.

Not unless you grow boobs
and straddle a Harley.

All right, it doesn't help
to whine about it.

If you wanna get lost in the woods
with Jerky Gherkineimer, go do it.

My life is just one big joke to you,
isn't it?

Actually, it's more of a limerick.

There once was a moron named Al
Who wanted to camp with his pal

Any chance you can go camping
in Nantucket?

So, Charlie, where's the wife and kid?

They went camping
to do some father-son bonding.

And when they looked
at the door handle of the car...

...there was nothing there...

...but a hook.

Hook? That makes no sense.

Oh, I left out a part.

The guy who escaped
from the insane asylum...

...had lost his hand
in some kind of industrial accident.

Anyway, they...
They replaced it with sharp metal hook.

And it was said hook...

...that was stuck
on the aforementioned door handle.

Wooo-ooo-ooo.

Dad, over the past three birthdays,
I've gotten $175 in bookstore gift cards.

They're yours if we could just go home.

No, no, we're... We're having fun.

Hey, hey, I know. We'll sing a song.

Come on. You used to love this one.

Come on.

Oh, come on. We had an adventure.

- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy?

Bite me.

You'll see. Someday you and I
will look back on this weekend...

...and laugh and laugh...

I didn't say someday soon.

Hey, come on.
I thought you liked wet T-shirts.

Hey.

Hey.

Shut up.

Oh, come on, Alan,
we both know I can't do that.

What do you want me to say?
It was a bad idea? Okay, it was a bad idea.

The only thing we bonded over
was our mutual discomfort...

...with pooping into a coffee can.

It wasn't Chock full o'Nuts, was it?

Sorry, sorry. Where's Jake?

He went back to his friends
in Hooterville.

Well, I can't blame him.
It never rains in Hooterville.

Look, Alan, seriously,
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

- I know your heart was in the right place.
- Thank you.

Now, I finished the limerick,
you wanna hear it?

Too soon?

You don't get it.

You don't understand what it's like to be
a little boy's best friend...

...to be someone he looks up to.

Then one day, you turn around
and the person he looks up to...

...is covered with baby oil
and nailed to the ceiling.

Count your blessings.
There's all kinds of pictures...

...that could be up there.
- I guess.

It could have been the Moscow Ballet.

I got it. Still, I can't help
but feel a little empty inside.

Like a chapter of my life is over.

So? You've still got
plenty to look forward to.

You mean, besides work,
loneliness and death?

Absolutely.

There's memory loss.

Impotence.

Adult diapers.

I'm all you've got, pal.

That's true.
My wives are gone, my son is grown.

But I'll always have you.

My brother.

Forever.

Okay, now I was just having fun
but that was mean.

Well, when will he be back?

All right, tell him I called again.

Boy, some agent.

He never calls, he never returns my calls.

I'm almost sorry I let him feel me up.

Well, I guess that's showbiz.

That's what he said.

- Listen, Kandi...
- I thought they liked me at that audition.

They had me read three times
and all the jumping jacks...

- Jumping jacks?
- It's an action series, Alan.

They need to know that I'm fit.

Ah. Uh...

Listen, Kandi, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

If it's the divorce papers,
I haven't signed them yet.

No, no, that's not why I'm here.

Sweetie, do you remember
why we split up?

- The big reason or all the little reasons?
- The big one.

- Because there were a lot of little reasons.
- I know.

- Like the way your toenails grow all crazy.
- Right.

- And your ear hair and your nose hair.
- Got it.

And that one long hair on your back.
Yuck.

Okay, forget the little reasons,
just the big one.

Yeah, you didn't wanna have a baby
and I did.

Right. Well...

What would you say
if I were to tell you...

...that I've changed my mind about that?

- Really?
- Yeah.

I've just been thinking
that Jake is almost grown...

...and there's still a lot of daddy
left in me.

So you wanna have a baby?

Yes, I do.

A fresh start. A new chapter.

Wow, that's a big step.

Yeah. I know. I know it is.
So if you wanna think about it, I...

No, that's okay. Let's make a baby.

Just like that?
Don't you wanna talk about it some more?

Alan, it's practically all we talked
about our entire marriage.

Baby, baby, toenails, baby, ear hair,
baby, how clocks work, baby.

So you really wanna do this?

Do what?

You see, if you use tape...

...it's much easier to rotate in new posters
when these ones stop working for you.

I don't think that's gonna happen.

Trust me, after a while...

...these beautiful eyes are gonna be filled
with judgment and condemnation.

What are you talking about?

Okay, maybe that was just me.

Anyway, you're lucky your dad
lets you hang posters like this.

I guess.

- Does your mother let you?
- No way.

So, what do you got at her house,
a secret stash of magazines?

Just one.
Playboy, 1998, the Christmas issue.

God bless Hugh Hefner, huh?

God bless Kimberly Macadoo
from Portland, oregon.

Born March 4th, 1979.

Turn-ons: Sunshine and goatees.
Turn-offs: Judgmental people and war.

You gotta love a chick
who doesn't like war.

Tape me.

Hey, Uncle Charlie,
could you do me a favor?

If it's the favor I'm thinking of,
not until you're 18 and not in my house.

- What?
- Nothing. Nothing. What do you need?

Could you get my dad to lay off
the father-son stuff? It's kind of lame.

Lame? You think it's lame your father
cares so much about you...

...and wants nothing more
than to be a part of your life?

Yeah.

Look, you gotta understand
what your father's going through.

What do you mean?

Okay, here's the deal.

Your father has reached
a very difficult age.

It's confusing
and a little bit scary for him.

Scary how?

Well, first of all, his body's changing.

- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

Hair is growing
where it's never grown before.

That is scary.

- And then there's the hormones.
- Hormones?

Yep. Your father is running out of them.

That sounds bad.

No, no, it's just a perfectly natural part
of growing old, Jake.

- Is it happening to you?
- No, no. No, no.

My point is that your father
is going through this phase...

...and you have to be patient
and understanding.

So he's gonna wanna go camping again?

Probably not in this lifetime.

But you might have to play catch with him
or something.

Guess I could do that.

Attaboy.

All right, well,
I'm glad we had this little talk. Ahem.

I'm gonna go get hammered.

Hello, ladies, I'm Harry Potter.

- Is there anything special we have to do?
- Oh, no.

It's a regular sex but without
the last-minute fumbling for a condom.

Oh, okay. But I still get all the rest
of the fumbling, right?

I prefer to call that foreplay.

Hold on.

Hello?

This is she.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Hold on a sec.

Here, we're divorced.

Okay, I'm back. You were saying?

Really? I got the part?

Thank you so much.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Alan, I got the part.

Oh. Oh, that's terrific. Congratulations.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, put that thing away.

- But I thought...
- Oh, please.

Nobody wants to see a pregnant
"fornesic" investigator.

Hey, can we still do it with a condom?

Hey, Dad, after this,
wanna go play catch?

- It's dark out.
- Okay.

I tried.

Help me out here, doc. I need
a time of death for our little cheerleader.

I can't give you an official TOD
until I get her on the slab.

But based on hypostatic lividity
and degree of rigor...

...I'd say our cheerleader got
her pom-poms pierced around halftime.

Anything else?

Left-handed assailant,
used a single-edged blade.

Multiple entry wounds
and defensive trauma.

So how are we gonna find
this psychopath?

Well, like our killer,
we'll just have to take a stab at it.

Unbelievable.

Yeah.

They're real, you know.

I know. I was married to her.

Oh, yeah.

Dog.

You know what? I'll be in my room.

So when are you guys going fishing?

.......... ********** ..........

Hello?

Oh, hey, Julia.
I was just on my way over.

Anything I need to bring?

Thai food? Wine? Batteries?

What do you mean, don't come?

Gee, do you really think your psychiatrist
is the best judge of who you sleep with?

Well, sure you could do better.
We could both do better.

But in the meantime,
I am on my way over.

Okay, okay, need to stop you here.

There is a big difference between
"meaningless" and "degrading."

You know what? I think
we'll just have to agree to disagree.

Okay, then, you have a nice life too.

Why do these women insist
on getting well?

- Hey, Alan...
- Hang on, Charlie.

This is an important moment...

...and I wanna savor it.

Alan J...

...Harper.

What's the big deal?
It's just an alimony check.

Not an alimony check.

This is my final alimony check.

Isn't it beautiful?

Oh, right,
Judith is getting married this weekend.

Exactly.
And you know what that means.

You can finally
kick in a few bucks around here?

Good one. No.

It means Alan gets new underwear.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go pick up my son...

...and deliver this last drop of blood money
to the former Mrs. Alan Harper...

...and soon to be Mrs. Herb Melnick.
May God have mercy on his soul.

Amen.

- So you want some company?
- You wanna come with me?

Yeah, why not? I don't have any plans.

You got stood up again, didn't you?

I'm starting to think all these girls
have the same damn shrink.

If you're gonna come,
grab your camera.

You can take some snapshots
of Pharaoh Judith letting her Alan go.

Got the camera right here.

- You carry it with you?
- Thought I had a date.

Takes video too.

I hand it to you, Charlie.

Stopping at the copy place
was a great idea.

And the picture will make
a terrific Christmas card.

Wanna get the door, Herb?
Stop yelling at me!

I am not yelling. This is yelling!

You know what?
This really isn't that funny.

- Oh, hi, Alan, Charlie.
- Herb.

- Hey.
- Is this a bad time?

The Spanish Inquisition was a bad time.
This is hell.

Come on in.

So, what's going on?
A little pre-wedding jitters?

We could call it that,
but we'd just be sugarcoating hell.

Oh, don't worry. As soon as Judith puts
on that beautiful white gown...

...marches down the aisle...
- She doesn't want white.

Says it makes her look fat.

Oh, well, that's nice.

She wants to look
trim and fit for the honeymoon.

You're sugarcoating hell again, Alan.

You wanna help the guy?
Stop talking and smother him with a pillow.

- Oh, great.
- Hey, there's the blushing bride.

She doesn't look fat at all.

- Go ahead, give her the check.
- What check?

Oh, well,
I figured as long as I was here...

...that I would give you
your last and final alimony check.

Got it.

- What the hell are you doing?
- Just a little souvenir.

I'll go find Jake.

She's being a good sport.
Let's get the big check.

No, forget the big check.
Forget the big check.

So, you know,
I read an interesting story the other day.

Married men live, on average,
10 years longer than single men.

What if they don't want to?

Come on, you and Judith
were meant for each other.

- What could possibly come between you?
- My sister.

- You got a sister?
- Down, Charlie.

She came out to help with the wedding,
but it's not really helping.

- What's she look like?
- Charlie.

- She doesn't have a therapist, does she?
- I swear to God.

So, what do you think?

Should I wear it
or have a vet check it for worms?

No, no, it looks fine.

- Myra, this is Judith's first husband Alan.
- Hi.

So how does this work?
Do you get your original testicles back...

...or does my brother give you his?

Myra, the castration jokes
are getting a little old.

Not at my house.

- This is Alans brother, Charlie.
- Oh, yeah, the booze-riddled sleazebag.

She did not hear that from me.

That's okay.
Not like it's a big secret.

Myra, where the hell is Jake?

- How should I know?
- I asked you to get him ready for his father.

You also asked me
to try on this satin stool sample.

Herb, tell your sister it's a lovely dress.

Herb, tell your fiancÃ©e the diet pills
are affecting her judgment, but not her ass.

That's it. She's gotta go.

- I can't throw out family.
- And that's the bitch of it, Herb.

Hey, you know, Charlie and I
were thinking of taking Jake out to a movie.

- We were?
- We were.

- Myra, would you like to join us?
- You didn't say anything about a movie.

I wanted to surprise you.

Hey, you know, that's a great idea.
Go to a movie with Alan and Charlie.

Can I wear my pretty new dress?

Get her out, Herb.

Hey, look what I found in the bushes.

God, I hate family movies.

What, you don't buy the central premise
that a dog can play hockey?

Well, not as a power forward.

Oh, we're flying the friendly skies,
are we?

- After you.
- Why, thank you.

Ahh. So you're staying at Judith's.

Yep.

What did she say about me?

Well, if she's telling the truth, we really
shouldn't be drinking out of the same cup.

That might be the nicest thing
she's ever said about me.

I just don't understand
what my brother sees in her.

You know, 15 years ago,
I asked the exact same question.

Little tip?
Don't do it during the wedding toast.

Maybe you can clear something up
for me.

Herb says
you're a successful jingle writer.

But Judith says you are a drunken,
talentless hack...

...who passed out
and fell into a pit of money.

So, what do you need cleared up?

But, ahem, you have me at a disadvantage.

I don't know why Judith hates you.

Hmm... It's hard to say.

Maybe it's because I'm smart.
Maybe it's because I'm independent.

Maybe it's because I offered my brother
a thousand dollars to call off the wedding.

I did the same thing with my brother.

You did?

Well, actually,
it was a thousand-dollar hooker.

But the thought was the same.

So, Myra...

...what do you do?

I teach high school economics.

Huh.

It may sound like a boring life,
but at night...

...I dress up like a giant spider
and fight crime.

Interesting. Now, did you decide spider
and have the costume made...

...or find the costume and say,
"okay, spider"?

Are you mocking the Scarlet Arachnid?

Sorry, sorry.

It's just hard to believe
that you're Herb's sister. He's so...

Hapless?

I was gonna say tall, but hapless works.

To hapless Herb.

To the Scarlet Arachnid.

Shh.

My enemies are everywhere.

BOTH
Let's all go to the lobby

Let's all go to the lobby

Let's all go to the lobby
And have ourselves a treat

We're here.

- Oh, yes. Judith's house of pain.
- Shh, shh, shh.

Lxnay. That's her idkay.

We're here.

Well, thanks for the movie.

- Wait, wait, wait. I'll walk you.
- Why, thank you.

Whoa-oh!

You okay?

I never know till I sober up.

- I think they like each other.
- Sure, they like each other.

No, I mean they "like" like each other.

Oh, no, Jake. Your Uncle Charlie only
"like" likes a certain type of woman.

- Mom calls them tramps.
- Well...

That's as good a word as any.

Thanks. That was fun.

Yeah, it was.

See you around.

Yeah.

I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.

Who cares?

Looks like Aunt Myra's a tramp, huh?

Oh, come on, Judith,
so he gave her a kiss.

It's no big deal.

Yeah, that's how Charlie says goodbye.

Yep, some people shake hands,
some people wave.

My brother darts his tongue
in and out of your mouth.

- What did I miss?
- You know Dr. Melnick?

The guy your mom's marrying?

- He has a sister...
- Got it.

I'm sure it has nothing to do
with you, Judith.

Wait, hang on a second.

- Are you done with your breakfast?
- Yeah.

- Then get out.
- Fine.

- Berta will just tell me later, right?
- Right.

Okay, Judith, that's insane.

Charlie would not do
Myra just to piss you off.

I don't think.

How would I know what he sees in her?

She got working girl-parts?

You know what, you leave.
Send Jake back.

Okay, okay, fine, fine, I'll talk to him.

I don't know.

I'll tell him to keep his hands off Myra.

And then I'll tell the rain not to fall...

...the Earth not to spin,
and you to stop nagging me.

Oh, boy, I'm gonna pay for that.

You know what your problem is?
Phone cojones.

- Excuse me?
- When you're on the phone with her...

...you got boulders between your legs.

The minute you hang up
you're as smooth as a Ken doll.

Phone cojones.

Good to have a name for it.

So tell me about the sister.

I don't know.
She doesn't seem like his type.

What, no coin slot in her forehead?

- Morning.
Morning.

Charlie, we need to talk about Myra.

- Yeah, that was probably a mistake.
- It was?

She's a nice kid,
but she's just not, you know...

A red-hot simpleton with no self-respect?

I hope she didn't take
that kiss thing too seriously.

- So you're not planning on pursuing her?
- No, no, no.

In fact, I got a date tonight
with a lovely sex addict...

...whose therapist is on vacation.

It's what we eligible bachelors call
"a window of opportunity."

You know, there's a special section
in hell reserved for people like you.

That's good because I'd hate
to have to stand on line.

So I'm like, "Yeah, I can make
a lot of money as a lingerie model...

...but then who's gonna take me
seriously as a director?"

- Good point.
- Sometimes I wish I wasn't beautiful.

I mean, ugly people have it
so easy, you know?

- I've heard.
- So, what about you?

- Still writing jingles?
- Just during the day.

At night I dress up as a big spider
and fight crime.

Huh. You know, I dated a cop once.

Well, it wasn't so much a date
as a way to get out of a ticket. Heh.

Interesting.

- Okay, here we are.
- Oh, I hope this place has fresh lobster.

That frozen stuff is just disgusting.

You know what, Herb?
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

I said I would do it, I'll do it.

Ugh. For God's sake, Judith,
get off his back.

No one's talking to you, Myra.
Okay, everyone calm down.

I'm doing it.

- Oh, hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Herb.

Just taking out the trash.

Yeah, I'm coming
from doing the same thing.

Great, he leaves the door wide o...

What the hell are you doing here?

That's a good question.

- See, the thing is, I...
- Oh, hey, Charlie.

Hi, Myra.

No, no. I forbid it. Not in my house.

What brings you to the cul-de-sac
of the damned?

Just in the neighborhood.

That's nice. Come on in.

Thanks.

I said no. Doesn't anybody listen to me?

I'm doing it, look!

You know, I really didn't expect
to see you again.

- Well, I wasn't doing anything, so...
No, Alan, listen to me.

He's here right now.

Why would I kid about that?

I don't know,
maybe his other date didn't work out.

Ah. The plot thickens.

Okay, okay, I can explain.

No, I can't.

Give it a shot.

Well...

...I was with this girl and I suddenly realized
that I'd rather be with someone...

...who I, you know,
actually enjoy being with.

Oh, just forget it, Alan. You're useless.

Herb, do something.

Hey.

I'm going out for ice cream.
Anyone wanna join me?

Charlie, when's the last time
you had a cone with sprinkles?

You know what, Herb? Judith can relax.
I'm gonna check into a hotel.

Myra, no. You don't have to do that.

Yes, she does.

Hey, she's my sister,
she can stay as long as she wants.

I really appreciate this.

- I'll go get my stuff.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

You don't have to stay at a hotel.
I got room at my place.

- Yeah, I'll bet you do.
- No, no, no.

No strings attached.

- Really?
- Really.

- Still, I couldn't impose like that.
- It's no imposition.

It's a big house.
There's plenty of room.

- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

Okay, then, I'll be right back.

Herb!

You wanna come too?

Are you nuts?

With Myra out of the house,
I might get lucky tonight.

Really? She seems pretty angry.

It's better when she's angry.

Coming, pookie.

This just sucks.

It's for a couple of days
till the wedding.

Yeah, but why does she have to stay
in my room?

Because... I don't know, you're the kid.

Yeah, well, it's not fair.

Yeah, well, get over it.

Oh, my God!

Jake, that's disgusting.

Yeah, well, get over it.

Go to sleep.

Did you brush your teeth?

Dad, I'm asleep.

Go brush your teeth.

- I can't. I don't have my toothbrush.
- Well, go get it.

Man, I have to do everything
around here.

Aunt Myra? I have to get my toothbrush.

Aunt Myra?

Aunt Myra?

Huh.

Oh.

Myra.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine. I just wanted to chat.

Oh, okay.

- I can go if you want.
- No, no. This is fine.

So.

- What's up?
- We never talked about that kiss last night.

Right, right.

That was out of character for me.

Really?
That's not the word on the street.

Okay, let me explain.

With me, kissing is usually
just a prelude to sex.

Last night, sex was the last thing
on my mind.

Oh, gee, what girl
doesn't like to hear that?

No, no, let me finish.

I kissed you because I really liked you.

And I wanted to express my...

...liking of you.
- Be still my beating heart.

Come on, Myra, I drove all the way
to Judith's house to see you.

And you know what's at Judith's house?

Judith.

- That was very brave of you.
- Oh, no, it wasn't brave, it was...

To tell you the truth, I don't know
what it was and I'm not...

...really sure what to do here.

What do you wanna do here?

Let's forget about me for a second.

- What about you?
- What about me?

You kissed first. Why'd you do that?

Oh, I was plowed.

Really?

Oh, come on, you moron.

I'm sitting in the middle of your bed
in my sexiest lingerie.

All right. I'm pretty sure
I know what to do now.

- Charlie?
- Yeah?

I don't wanna put any pressure on you...

...but I'm a virgin.

You are?

Man, you gotta stop sleeping
with dumb girls.

It's rubbing off on you.

Why can't I sleep in my bed?
Aunt Myra's not there.

I'm sure she will be.

She's probably just getting
something in the kitchen.

That's not the kitchen.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

You were meant for each other.
What could come between you?

- My sister.
- You got a sister?

You know what, Herb? Judith can relax.
I'm gonna check into a hotel.

Myra, no, you don't have to do that.

Yes, she does.

Hey, wait.
You don't have to stay at a hotel.

- I got plenty of room at my place.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

No strings attached.

Why can't I sleep in my bed?
Aunt Myra's not there.

I'm sure she will be. She's probably
just getting something in the kitchen.

That's not the kitchen.

Thinking of chewing your arm off?

What? No, no, no. Why would I do that?

I don't know, maybe because
you're not horny anymore...

...and you just remembered
I'm staying through the weekend.

Wow, you got all that from the twitching
of my shoulder muscles?

I have those muscles too, Charlie.

Okay, good to know.

Well, to be honest,
I did have a momentary panic reflex...

...but it passed,
and I'm actually happy you're here.

You sound surprised.

Surprised doesn't begin to cover it.

Normally at this point in a relationship, I'm
busy plotting the appropriate exit strategy.

For example?

Well...

...that would depend on whether I'm trying
to get rid of you just for today or forever.

Let's say today.

Okay, today I have to see my dermatologist
about a little rash.

Oh, that's good.
All right, what about forever?

Turns out it wasn't a rash
and they won't let me come home.

- Impressive.
- Thank you.

I'm kind of a savant.

Looks like you're good at two things.

What's the other one?

- Oh, right.
- The piano.

Okay, I just checked.
No one slept in my bed all night.

None of your business who slept where.

Excuse me, but if who sleeps in my bed
is not my business, then what is?

Let it go, Goldilocks.

- Morning.
- Morning.

And how many times do you have to get up
to go pee?

- I wasn't counting.
- I was. Four.

- One was to get a glass of water.
- There's your problem.

Stop topping off the tank.

- What's going on?
- I had to sleep in Dad's room last night.

Uncle Charlie invited Aunt Myra to stay
in my room but it turns out...

Got it.

Well, do you think it's fair?

Nothing about your uncle Charlie's life
is fair.

Finish your breakfast.
We'll get you fitted for a tux.

- Why do I have to wear a tuxedo?
- Your mother's getting married.

- You're in the wedding party.
- Why do I have to be in the party?

Your mother still thinks you're cute.

- Morning.
Morning.

Everybody get a good sleep?

- No.
- No.

So, Charlie, where's this house guest
I'm hearing about?

Uh, gee, I guess she's probably
still asleep in Jake's room.

Oh, please. You are such a liar.

- What?
- Forget it, Charlie. We know.

- You do?
We do.

Okay, well, I got a good night's sleep.

Probably because Aunt Myra
doesn't pee a lot.

- Can I talk with you in private?
- Oh, come on. It's no big deal.

I was in the middle of flossing
and suddenly there she is...

...sitting on my bed...
- Ah-ah-ah!

He doesn't need to hear this.

Fine.

Like I didn't hear enough last night.

Okay. Uh...

Let me just start by saying I applaud
the gusto with which you approach life.

Thank you.

That being said...

...are you out of your freaking mind?

- Beg pardon?
- You just could not control yourself.

A female's in the house,
she must be mounted.

No, it's not like that at all.
And why do you even care?

Why? You ask me why?

Never mind. Not important.

I will tell you why.

Because every time you rut
with any woman...

...even remotely connected to my life,
I end up suffering.

- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous, you say?

All right, all right,
let's look at the record.

- You slept with Judith's sister...
- Well, yeah, but...

- At my wedding reception.

All right, poor timing.

You had more sex on my wedding day
than I did.

That part's not my fault.

Okay, okay, let's jump ahead.

When Judith was divorcing me...

...who seduced
and then abandoned my lawyer...

...causing her to take revenge on me?

- Now, hold on, that chick was nuts.
- I lost everything.

Well, to be fair, you didn't have
that much to begin with.

And now...

...that Judith
is finally getting remarried...

...and I can see the light at the end
of the alimony tunnel...

...you decide, "Hey, why don't
I start humping her new sister-in-law?"

- That is not how it happened.
- I don't care how it happened.

I only care how it's gonna end.
And it's gonna end badly for me.

How? Explain how.

I don't know yet.

That's always part of the fun.

Trying to guess how your penis
is gonna bite me in the ass.

Alan, you gotta believe me here.

This is different. I really like Myra.

Oh, you like all of them.

And then you don't.

What's gonna happen
when you get tired...

...of this poor gi...?
Morning.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Boy, I slept great.

- Jake's bed is really comfortable.
- Don't bother, he knows.

Oh. Boy, I slept great.

Charlie's a terrific lover.

Oh, this one's gonna be bad.

I don't understand
why I can't have the blue tuxedo.

You're going to your mother's wedding...

...not hosting a game show
on Telemundo.

This from a grown man
wearing a green polo shirt.

All the other men are gonna
be wearing black tuxedos.

If the other men were jumping off
a bridge, would you want me to?

If it'd keep your mother
off my back, yes.

- I'll get the jacket.
- Thank you.

Listen, this is a very big day
for your mother.

It's important that you cooperate
and make her proud of you.

I'm her son. She has to be proud of me.

You think so, huh?

Have you met my mother?

Oh, yeah.

Let me explain something to you.

A woman's wedding day is something
she will remember for the rest of her life.

So if you screw it up, she will never forgive
you, even if it was your brother's fault...

...and there was nothing you could do
to prevent it short of having him fixed.

Don't worry, Dad. It'll be fine.

- Thank you.
- I don't have a brother.

Hey, listen, we haven't really talked
about what all this means.

- What "what" means?
- Well, the big changes that are happening.

It's just a couple of hairs, Dad.
It's not that big a deal.

Not those changes.

The wedding. You're gonna have
a stepdad in your life.

- So?
- So is there anything you wanna talk about?

Do you have any questions?

- Just one.
- Yeah, buddy?

Why can't I wear the blue tuxedo?

Jake, your dinner's getting cold.

So, what did you guys do today?

We went on the Universal Studios Tour...

...and then Charlie took me
to the Hollywood Wax Museum.

You're kidding?
I thought you hate that stuff.

What gave you that idea?

Whenever I ask if you
to go some place like that, you say:

"I hate that touristy stuff."

- Well, this is different.
- How?

I enjoy her company.

And it's my first trip to L.A.,
so I wanna do all the traditional stuff.

Tomorrow we're gonna sit in rush-hour
traffic and give other drivers the finger.

Good evening.

- Why are you wearing that?
- You said I look great.

I don't want you messing it up
before your mom's wedding.

I won't mess it up.

Alan, you gotta admit he lends
a bit of class to the place.

Thank you, my good man.

Hey, speaking of the wedding, Charlie,
I have a favor I'd like to ask.

- Sure.
- I have to be there and I was just thinking...

...that the only way it is gonna be any fun
is if you come with me.

You want me to be your date
at Judith's wedding?

Yeah.

We'll have some laughs.
What do you say?

I'm laughing already.

Uh-oh.

Well, that's too bad, Herb. You tell Judith
if she wants me to be a bridesmaid...

...and wear that brown satin
turd of a dress...

...then I am entitled to bring whoever I want
as a date and I want Charlie.

Okay, bye.

See? No problem.

Hi, Judith.

Problem.

Here's your suit.

Thanks, Berta.

The dry cleaners found $46
and a condom in the breast pocket.

Here's the condom.

Again, thanks.

Can I give you some free advice?

Free? I'm already down $46.

What is it you say about going to a wedding
with a woman you're sleeping with?

This is different.

You say, and I quote,
"Better I should light myself on fire...

...and run through a meth lab."

Oh, well, that's just a figure of speech.

Come on, Charlie,
what are you doing with this girl?

- What do you mean?
- I mean, she's a nice kid.

You're gonna break her heart.

- You don't know that.
- I know you.

Myra's not one of your Handi Wipes
in high heels you can throw out...

...after you wipe your Handi.

You don't know
what you're talking about...

...because this relationship
is not based on sex.

Not based on sex?

Well, unless she sweats bourbon
and farts hundred-dollar bills...

...what exactly
is gonna keep you together?

Oh, crap.

No, you listen to me.

If Myra wants to bring Charlie
to the wedding, that's her business.

No, I will not intervene and you're just
gonna have to live with it. Goodbye.

- I changed my mind. I'm not going.
- Oh, thank God.

Judith, great news.

I talked him out of it.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- What you doing?
- Grading tests.

- Tenth-grade economics?
- Uh-huh.

- Ask me a question.
- Okay.

The functions and implications
of monetary policy are...

Never mind.

You sure? I grade on a curve.

That's all right.
I'm stupid on a straight line.

Listen...

...about the wedding.

I don't think I should go.

Okay.

I'm just concerned that maybe
we should slow things down a bit.

What things?

You know, things.

I mean...

...you don't know me that well...

...and I'm afraid that I might hurt you
without meaning to.

- Don't worry about it.
- Okay, good. I won't.

Exactly what is it
I'm not worrying about?

- Hurting me.
- Right.

Why am I not worrying about that?

I'm a big girl, Charlie.

Some might even say a woman.

I wanna go to the wedding with you.

Don't worry about Jake.
I'll get him there in time.

Well, you are very welcome.

Best of luck to you and Herb.

- Bye-bye.
- I'm going to the wedding.

What is this, candle wax?

How do you get candle wax on the seat
of your pants?

- I don't know.
- You don't know?

Okay, I might have lit a couple farts.

- I'm ready. Myra's ready. Is he ready?
- Does he look ready?

Well, he's not wearing any pants.

That's ready for some things.

Just go ahead. I'll get him there.

Okay.

What is that?

Pudding.

You know what?
I just realized something.

I am two for two at Judith's weddings.

What a coincidence.
I'm two for two at Herb's weddings.

Huh.

Okay, what about funerals?
Can you beat a three-way in a hearse?

No.

You have to think about it?

It's a gray area.

Where have you been?
I was looking for you.

- We were having sex in the coatroom.
- Ha, ha. Good one.

One of my groomsmen
got food poisoning.

Walk down the aisle with Uncle Fred.

Uncle Fred? Is that the only man left?

Well, there's cousin Trudy.

She's pre-op,
but she's wearing a very nice tux.

Why can't I just walk down the aisle
with Charlie?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just
an innocent bystander at this shindig.

Oh, picture the look on Judith's face
when she sees you at the altar.

I'm in.

Oh, God.

- Herb. Herb.
- Oh, hi.

Thanks for bringing him down.
Oh, you look very handsome, Jake.

I know. It's the tux.

Okay, well, congratulations.
I wish you both a lot of happiness.

- Thanks.
- Don't make the same mistakes I did.

I won't. She wrote them down for me.

Good.

- All right, buddy, have fun.
- Okay.

Oh, remember that tux is a rental.

Excuse me.

Are you Judith's ex-husband?

Yeah, I was just dropping off our son.
I'm sorry, do I know you?

Oh, no. Not really. It's...

Herb and I were engaged
before he met Judith, so...

- And you're coming to his wedding?
- Yeah, we're still friends.

Well, how very California of you.

Yeah. Well, I wish him the best.

I have to tell you,
based on first impressions...

...I'm not sure
that Judith is trading up.

Oh, thank you.

And having just met you...

...I feel safe in saying that Herb's
not getting an upgrade either.

Oh, man.

- Nice dress.
- Bite me.

Okay. Meet me in the coatroom.

Listen, after the reception,
can you take me to the airport?

- You're flying home tonight?
- Yeah.

- I thought we had something going here.
- We did. Now I'm going home.

Okay. Maybe I can come visit you
sometime.

I don't think my boyfriend
would like that very much.

You got a boyfriend?

- He's more like a fiancÃ©.
- You're getting married?

Why didn't you tell me you were engaged?

I thought it'd be awkward.

Awkward?

You may be seated.

Mm. Oh. We really
shouldn't be doing this.

- Why not? They broke our hearts.
- Yeah, but I'm kind of over it.

I'm not.

Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
Maybe we can go out for coffee first.

Or a movie.

Alan, this is gonna happen with you
or without you.

With me or...

How does that work?

The institution of marriage
is not one to enter lightly.

So we pause at this time to consider
the depth of that commitment.

Oh, Alan Harper, you animal.

I can't believe Judith let you go.

Oh, God, Alan Harper. Oh, God.

Oh, don't stop, Alan Harper.
Please don't stop.

Oh, Alan Harper.
I feel like a woman again.

I'm Alan Harper, and I'm not having sex.

- Hey.
- Hey.

How was the reception?

Kind of a letdown after the ceremony.

But you'll be happy to know your
little outburst is already on YouTube.

Damn camera phones.

- Boy, is Mom mad at you.
- Yeah.

She might start her second marriage
the same way as the first.

So, ahem...

...drinking in the dark, eh?

It wasn't dark when I started.

- Did you get Myra to the airport?
- Yep.

And you know what?

I'll never see her again.

I was just a meaningless fling
to that girl.

Huh. I'll bet this is that whole
karma thing people talk about.

Could be.

You know that feeling you get when...

...somebody's gone from your life...

...and you suddenly realize
that you miss them?

Yeah?

I don't care for it.

Hey, you know what always
cheers me up?

Pigs in a blanket.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, oh, that is so true.

I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, hang on, I'll get you an ashtray.

- Oh, hey, Charlie.
- Hey, what's going on?

Oh, I have a friend over
from my single-parent support group.

Oh, yeah, unattached moms.
I gotta check out that group.

- But you don't have a kid.
- Are they really strict about that?

Because at the dog park, you show up with
a leash and say, "That's him by the tree."

It's a single-parent group.
You need to be a single parent.

Seems a little prejudiced if you ask me.

Hey, Alan, can I use your bathroom,
or should I just pee off the deck?

Heh, it's right down the hall.

Oh, uh, Greg, uh, this is
my brother, Charlie. Charlie, Greg.

Hey.
- Hey, nice place.

Thanks.

She's a little butch for you, isn't she?

Greg is a divorced dad.
He's got a daughter around Jake's age.

Well, you can understand my confusion.

You think I joined a group
to pick up women?

No, I think you joined a support group
because you're a whiny little wuss.

But as long as you're there,
you might as well nail a few.

- Sex is not what the group's about.
- Oh, grow up.

You put single men and women
on chairs in a church basement...

...they're gonna start mounting
each other.

The depths of your degeneracy
continue to astound me.

Really? Still?

So, Charlie, I'm guessing by the stack
of racing forms next to the can...

...you bet the ponies.
- Hey, I'd bet on rabbits...

...if you could get them organized.

Is there a story behind that riding crop
hanging on the wall?

Oh, yeah, that's a souvenir from a
wonderful weekend in Louisville, Kentucky.

- Oh, you went to the Derby?
- No, it was a Hilton by the airport.

- How about you? Do you hit the track?
- It's actually my second-biggest expense...

...after alimony.
- So all your money goes to the nags, huh?

- Hey, your brother's funny.
- At first.

I'll get us some more beers.

Charlie, you smoke cigars?

I'd smoke rabbits
if you could keep them lit.

- So divorced dad, huh?
- Yep.

- How long were you married?
- Sixteen years.

Whoa.

What ended it? Cheating? Drinking?
Gambling?

Gay.

- Oh, her?
- No.

Ah, ahem.

So, what, you didn't wanna
try drinking or gambling?

So, what about you, Charlie?
Ever been married?

Ha, are you kidding? My brother
is definitely not the marrying kind.

- Oh? Confirmed bachelor.
- No, no, nothing's confirmed.

I mean, I just think variety
is the spice of life.

And as far as spices go, some people
like salt, some people like pepper...

...some people like salt and pepper.
Me, I like women. Ahem.

Me too. Some of my best friends
are women.

No, no, don't... Don't misunderstand.

None of my friends are women.

- Oh, I see.
- No, you don't.

Oh, damn. I have to take a rain check
on that beer. I gotta get going.

Oh, oh, okay. Uh, we still on for Sunday?

Looking forward to it.
Really nice meeting you.

- I'll see you at the track sometime.
- You never know.

- Santa Anita or Hollywood Park?
- Which one do you like?

- Oh, I'll go either way.
- Apparently.

Oh, he's bad.

You have no idea.

- Okay, so I'll see you Sunday.
- Bye-bye.

Adios.

- Great guy, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, terrific.

- How much do you know about him?
- Well, I know he's a successful architect...

...his daughter's a soccer player, he's gay,
he has a boat, he went to UC Berkeley...

okay, okay, back up a little.

Oh, it's a sailboat.
Well, it's more of a sloop. He's...

- He's taking me and Jake out on Sunday.
- No, no, no, one more.

What? He's gay? What about it?

Nothing, I'm just looking out for you.

I mean, does he wanna take you sailing,
or does he wanna take you...

...sailing?

Don't be silly. He knows I'm not gay.

Are you sure?

For 16 years, he didn't know he was gay.

You don't believe two men can be friends,
just because one of them is gay?

It has nothing to do with gay.

Imagine he were a straight guy
and you were an attractive young woman.

- Do you think you could just be friends?
- How attractive?

What?

I mean, uh, you know, am I kind of cute
in a tomboy sort of way...

...or am I smoking hot and working it?

Okay, okay, let's start again.

Imagine you were a straight guy.

- And...?
- No "and. " That's it.

Berta, how long have you
been working for me?

Define "working."

What kind of hair conditioner do I use?

I quit.

I use a wash-out conditioner, then blow-dry
with a dab of styling gel.

But you got me a leave-in conditioner.

Why would you get
leave-in conditioner?

- The truth?
- Please.

It came with a free Lady Schick.

Berta, my hair is important to me.

All right, don't get your panties
in a bunch.

What is that supposed to mean?

It means don't get so agitated...

...that your undergarments
become entangled within your crack.

Hey, hey, hey. I am not agitated,
I just like having extra body without...

...you know, stiffness.

Okay, why don't you guys hang outside
while we throw together some lunch?

Okay. Come on, Sophie.

- This is a cool house.
- Yeah, it's my weekend place.

I have a second home in the valley.

- I think they like each other.
- Oh, Jake is smitten.

I usually only see that look on his face
when we go to the pancake house.

- Hey.
- Hi, Charlie.

- Hey, how'd the sailing go?
- Oh, great. Perfect weather.

- Here, I, uh, brought you a present.
- Really?

Yeah, it's one of those Cuban fellas
you like puffing on.

- That's very sweet, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

Did you do something different
with your hair? Looks nice.

Don't get me started.

So when did you find out
about your dad?

- Find out what?
- That he's gay.

My dad's not gay.

You sure? My dad is.

- No kidding?
- Yep.

You smell like strawberries.

It's my lip gloss.

Cool. Does it taste like it smells?

- You wanna find out?
- Sure.

Mm.

Can we watch a soccer game
instead of basketball?

What are you, nuts?

Sophie says soccer's
the most popular sport in the world.

Well, then they don't need us
to watch it.

You know what would be a good idea?

Maple-syrup lip gloss.

Your mom will be here any minute.

- I told you to get ready.
- I'm ready.

- Did you do your homework?
- No.

Jake, I promised your mother
you'd have it done.

Well, next time you'll know better.

I think Jake has a thing
for your boyfriend's daughter.

He's not my boyfriend. We're friends.

Friends, huh?

Alan, when an intelligent, successful,
attractive man...

...wants to be friends with you...

...something is amiss.

Excuse me, but if Greg were to be
interested in anybody around here...

...it would be you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

- What are you talking about?
- Heh.

Come on, Charlie, you got to admit
you put out a special kind of vibe.

You don't mean special,
you mean:

Special.

And I don't.

You're 40 years old,
you've never been married...

...you play the piano, you're meticulous
about your appearance...

Hey, hey, hey, I've got a riding crop in
my bathroom that never touched a horse.

Your bathroom also has two kinds
of skin moisturizer...

...various hair gels, colognes,
powders and emollients.

I only have one moisturizer.

The other one is a sun block
with moisturizer.

Ah, right, you need that sun block...

...for when you lean out the front door
to get the paper.

There's no shade out there in the morning,
Alan.

Uh-huh.

Excuse me for not wanting to spend
my 50s looking like a catcher's mitt.

All right, all right, let's, uh, scoot away
from the Clinique counter for a minute...

...and, uh, discuss some of the people
you've attracted.

Okay. You're thinking about that time
at the House of Blues...

...and there's no way I could've known
that was a guy.

He was 6'2"
and could palm a medicine ball.

I was drunk, he was tucked, taped
and gorgeous.

Charlie, you brought home a dude
in a dress.

A dude who wanted to be a woman...

...which means he was looking
for a straight man, which is me.

Rationalize it any way you want, but he still
sends you flowers on valentine's Day.

Only because I was a gentleman.

- So how was your weekend?
- It was okay.

- We went sailing.
- Oh, how nice.

- What else?
- Nothing.

Oh, yeah, I think Dad's gay now.

That was a red light, Mom.

So, Charlie, I haven't seen you
in a while.

What's up?

Why does something have to be up?
Can't I just drop by and say hello?

For $350 an hour,
you can say anything you want.

Okay, well, there is something
that's been kind of gnawing at me.

Mm-hm.

Well, this friend of mine...

Your friend?

Yeah, a friend.

It's your money, Charlie.

Okay. Okay.

Is it possible that I could be gay
without knowing it?

Why do you ask?

Well, my brother's got this friend...

We're talking $7 a minute.

No, no, no, this friend's real.

He's gay, and apparently
I triggered his gaydar.

- Well, I can understand that.
- You can?

You can?

Let me ask you something, Charlie.
Have you ever had sex with a man?

No. No. Absolutely not.

All right, I copped a feel once,
but I was drunk and he had breasts.

- Hey, is Jake ready?
- Jake, your father's here.

- He'll be right out.
- Good.

So, uh, how've you been?

- Good. And you?
- Good.

Oh, come here. I am so proud of you.

Thanks. What did I do?

Alan, you don't have to hide anymore.

Jake told me all about you and Greg. I want
you to know I completely support you.

- Oh, gee, Judith, um...
- Is that him in the car? Gee, he's cute.

Hello. That must be his daughter.
I can see why Jake has a crush on her.

- Yeah, we're taking them to the movies...
- This makes so much sense.

I can't believe I didn't see this
when we were married.

- See what?
- Oh, come on, Alan.

You picking out my clothes,
your neat fetish, the show tunes, the sex.

- There was no sex.
- Exactly.

All those years you were so miserable,
and look at you now. You're glowing.

No, wait. Hang on a second.
The reason that there was no...

- Really, I'm glowing?
- Well, yeah.

To think, all this time I've been blaming
myself because the marriage didn't work.

No, I'm pretty sure
you've been blaming me.

It was nobody's fault, Alan. I'm just so glad
you've finally accepted who you really are.

Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.

Hey, Sophie.

You boys are so cute
with your double dates.

- Listen, Judith...
- I almost forgot.

Your mother told me to tell you
that she's behind you a hundred percent.

- When did you talk to my mother?
- Well, after Jake told me, I called her.

- Why?
- We had a little bet. It's not important.

Bye-bye.

I mean, okay, I do care
about my appearance.

Plus I've got mother issues
and a bit of a flair for interior design.

You know, sconces, throw pillows,
bric-a-brac.

Mm.

But when it comes to penises,
I am pretty clear...

...that the only one I want winking at me
is my own.

Who are you trying to convince here,
Charlie? Me or you?

You, and then I want you
to convince me.

Why do you need convincing?

- Wow, good question.
- Thanks.

Once in a while I get a little wood
on the ball.

I mean, it has been suggested to me
that all of my womanizing...

...is just my way of overcompensating.

Who suggested that?

Uh, mostly the women
I was overcompensating on top of.

Well, this is a very interesting area,
but I'm afraid we're out of time.

What? No, no, we can't stop here.

- I have a patient waiting, Charlie.
- Right. Hold on a sec.

Here, go get yourself something to eat.
Come back in an hour.

Okay, new clock.

My mom took my temperature the baby way
till I was 8 years old.

Hey, Dad.

- Yeah?
- It's okay if I'm not gay, right?

Jake, listen, you and I
need to clear the air about something.

- After I call Sophie.
- You just saw her.

- What do you need to talk about?
- Boy-girl stuff. You wouldn't understand.

Hey, Alan. Your mom called.

- She gave me the news.
- Oh, God.

Come here.

I'm proud of you, Zippy.

The world is a happier place
once you figure out...

...whether you're the pin or the cushion.

Good night.

Charlie?

- Yeah?
- I think I might be gay.

What did you do, Alan?

Nothing, but I'm starting
to put the pieces together.

Which piece did you put where, Alan?

I'm just thinking that...

...I've failed at every
female relationship I've had.

Oh, come on, that makes every man
in the world gay.

Let me finish.

I've been unhappy for most of my life.

I've never really fit in anywhere...

...and now, suddenly, I'm happy.

Some might even say I'm glowing.

There is a big leap
between glowing and flaming.

I'm just saying that this friendship
with Greg has been so easy...

...and fun, and everybody else
just seems happier thinking I'm gay.

Maybe that's the answer.

What was the question?

Who is Alan Harper?

That's easy.

Alan Harper is an idiot.

Why is my sexuality
so threatening to you?

It's not threatening. I am not threatened.

- Is that so?
- Okay.

- Okay.
- Hmm?

Now, you listen to me.

You're not gay, I'm not gay,
nobody's gay.

- Nobody's gay?
- Not in this house.

Where are you going?

I have to buy some new hair conditioner.

- That was a good meeting tonight.
- Yeah, it was okay...

...but some of those single moms
get real gossipy.

Oh, oh, like, uh, Rebecca Milford:

Yakety-yakety-yakety.

And did you see what she had on?

Who could miss it?
A woman that size should not wear paisley.

- Okay, thanks for the ride.
- Oh, oh, no problem.

We still taking the kids
to the mall Saturday?

You kidding?
I'm taking Jake to the mall Friday...

...so he can have cool clothes to wear
to the mall Saturday.

So maybe I'll see you there Friday.
Okay, bye-bye.

- Greg, wait.
- Yeah?

- Alan?
- Yeah?

What are you doing?

Uh, I was just, you know...

...checking.

Checking what?

Well, it's not important.

I just thought, uh, that, you know,
possibly...

...I might be...

Never mind.

Alan, you're not gay.

Are you sure?

Do you find me sexually attractive?

- No.
- Do you find any man sexually attractive?

No. Well, maybe George Clooney.

Clooney doesn't count.

Trust me, you're not gay.

Okay.

You seem disappointed.

I just... I feel like
I'm letting a lot of people down.

Alan...

...it's okay to be straight.

Yeah, I guess.

So just to put all our cards on the table,
you're not at all attracted to me?

No. You're not my type.
Now, Charlie on the other hand...

- What about him?
- He's, uh, very pretty.

Get out of my car.

- What?
- You think Charlie's so pretty?

- Go to the mall with Charlie.
- Oh, come on, Alan, we're friends.

No, I'm always the friend.
Everybody wants Charlie.

Alan, you're not gay.

Yeah, well, there's
a principle involved. Good night.

Suit yourself.

Well...

...at least I know who I am.

A heterosexual nut job.

I can't believe you broke up
with Sophie's dad.

I didn't...

I'm not...

I'm sorry.

You know what would help this room?

Get rid of all these lamps
and put in some track lighting.

Much more flattering.

- What are you eating?
- Lip gloss.

.......... ********** ..........

Thank you for transporting me home.

You are a terrific cab driver
and I hope some day to visit your country.

Damn, where is that key?

Here, key, key, key.

Aha!

Hello, key.

Oh, no.

Wrong house.

I'm lost.

Hello?

Oh, hey, Alan. Come on in.

Why don't you come in here?

I can't. I lost my key.

Dah!

Had a few cocktails, did we?

Me too.

Listen, I need to ask you a favor.

Your needs. Your needs.
What about my needs?

Are you capable
of having a conversation?

Capable?

I just spent 20 minutes
discussing open-toed shoes...

...with a fat man from Rangoon.

He's a Rangoonian.

- We'll talk in the morning.
- I wouldn't count on it.

Go ahead, you talk, I'll cook.

It's 11:30. What are you cooking?

Good question. And I can give you
the answer in two words:

My famous homemade chili.

Since when do you make chili?

There's a lot
you don't know about me, Alan.

I am a man of many layers.

- Strata, if you will.
- I see.

A thin crust, magma...

...and a chewy nougat center.

Great. Anyway, tomorrow I have to go
to the DMV to get my license renewed.

Ah, cars.
Where would we be without cars?

And how would we get there?

Run, run, you're free.

Well, listen, the thing is...

...I can't take Jake,
because he's got a book report to do.

I love Jake.

Well, that's good.
But will you help him with his report?

I would like nothing better.

- You want chili?
- No, I'm good.

But just so we're clear, you'll help Jake?

I love Jake.

- Charlie, it's very important...
- Relax.

I'll take Jake to the DMV
to get his license.

Book report.

Beans.

Oh, no.

Charlie's blackout chili.

It's delicious.

No argument there.

Why is it called blackout chili?

Well, sweetheart...

...sometimes when people drink,
they do things they wouldn't normally do.

Me, I like to walk into a biker bar...

...and take a swing
at the biggest chick there.

Your uncle Charlie, on the other hand,
makes chili.

But what's the blackout part?

Oh, jeez, Jake.

How many times have I told you
not to crap up my kitchen?

But I'm not the one who...

oh.

Still, it beats waking up to find pool chalk
between your fanny cheeks.

So where's your father?

He went to the DMV. He said you promised
to help me with my book report.

Really? That doesn't sound like me.

I didn't think so, but that's what he said.

- When's it due?
- Monday.

- Okay. Today's Saturday?
- Yeah.

We got plenty of time.

Yeah, but my dad always says
if I do my work early...

...I have the weekend to have fun.

That makes no sense whatsoever.

That's what I said.

Let me ask you something.

- Do you wanna do it now?
- No.

Then trust your instincts.

Here's what you do.

You go out, have a good time.

Let the report percolate
in your subconscious.

Then, as the deadline approaches
and that flop-sweat panic hits...

...those pages will come shooting
out of you like lunch from a supermodel.

Well, I do like to percolate.

Attaboy.

And what are you doing today?

I've gotta write a new jingle
for a credit-card company...

...and they're expecting it on Monday.

So I'm going to the track.

WOMAN
Now serving Number 38 at Window D.

I got 42.

I made an appointment.

Good for you.

What's your number?

- I'm 97.
- Mm. Ouch.

You're gonna be here forever.

Yeah.

Oh, hey, you know what?

I'm probably not even gonna need
this PowerBar.

You want it?

Thanks.

You're very kind.

Next time, plan ahead.

Will do.

- You gotta know how to work the system...
- Again...

...thanks.

Okay, I'm leaving.

Bye.

If you need anything, ask Berta.

- Okay.
- She won't give it...

...but she enjoys being asked.

All right.

- Turn that off, you're coming with me.
- Really? To the track?

It's gotta be better for you than Tv.

- Are we gonna gamble?
- No, suckers gamble.

We're gonna analyze statistics
with proven scientific principles...

...and make wagers
based on the resulting data.

I think I'd rather watch Tv.

Come on. Come on.

WOMAN
Now serving Number 39 at Window A.

It appears my time on your planet
is almost over. Ha-ha-ha!

"Ha-ha-ha!"

Excuse me, are you done
with your paper?

Oh, sure. Here.

Thank you.

I didn't even have a chance
to finish the jumble.

- Well, I'll have time.
- Ooh.

Hey, 97, that ought to lift your spirits.

I'm ebullient.

I feel like an idiot. I didn't know
you could make an appointment.

Well, most people don't.

Am I right?

- Lena.
- Oh, I'm Alan.

Ooh. You have a firm handshake, Alan.

I like that in a man.

Well, I'm a chiropractor.
My hands are my instruments.

And I also carry a little squishy ball
in my pocket to head off carpal tunnel.

Ooh.

- How much can I bet?
- How much did you bring?

I have to use my own money?

Boy, you really are your father's son,
aren't you?

Okay.

I have $14.

That's not gonna get you very far.

Oh, and I have
a $50 gift certificate to Pizza Hut.

- Wanna buy it?
- Sure. I'll give you 25 bucks.

But it's worth 50.

- To who?
- To Pizza Hut.

Well, then let the good folks
at Pizza Hut place a bet for you.

You're just trying to rip me off.

I've been staying up nights
trying to figure out...

...how to get my hands
on your pizza money.

Now listen and learn.

In any financial transaction, there is one
question both parties ask themselves.

We're going to a party?

Will you shut up and listen?

I thought we were going to the track.

I swear to God,
I will throw you out of this car.

Now, as I was saying.

The question is, what leverage do I have
in this transaction?

And the answer for you is none.

What's leverage?

Oh, boy.

All right, a lever is how you move things.

Leverage is how you move people.

Now, if we were going to Pizza Hut...

...and they didn't take real money
and I was starving to death...

...your gift certificate
would give you leverage over me.

But, alas, this is not the case.

Okay, I guess I'll take $40.

Now you're catching on. But no.

WOMAN
Number 40 at Window E.

I'm sorry, baby. Mama's gotta stay here
till she gets her license.

I'm hungry too.
I don't know how much longer.

You wanna come in here
and wait with me?

All right, you stay in the car
and play your video game.

Mama loves you too.

I get such little time with him.

Where's his dad?

Damned if I know.

Now serving Number 41 at Window B.

Oh, he is gonna miss his piano lesson.

Listen, why don't you take my number?

- Oh, I couldn't.
- No, no, no, I insist.

I've got somebody taking care
of my little boy, so I can wait.

That is so sweet.

Now serving Number 42 at Window B.

Oh, you're up.

- Thank you so much.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

Hey, listen, maybe,
you think some time...

...we could go out?
Hey, Mama.

Baby, I thought you were
waiting in the car.

- My batteries are dead.
- That's okay, we're out of here.

- Wha...? You lied to me.
- No, I didn't.

- Baby, you got a piano lesson today?
- Yup.

Gershwin.

See?

Hey, I thought you had her
at "squishy ball."

So how much do I get if my horse wins?

You bet 14 at 2-to-1, you win $28.

That doesn't sound like a lot.

Why can't I bet the 80-to-1 horse?

You can but there's dogs
with forks and napkins...

...waiting at the finish line
for that horse.

- What's that mean?
- It means the greater the odds...

...the lousier the horse.

But he could still win, right?

Yeah, and you could
still be class valedictorian.

But that's not
where the smart money goes.

You can make your point
without being mean.

Look, if you want me to bet
the 80-to-1 horse for you, I will.

- Okay, fine.
- It'll be a good lesson for you.

You won't be such a know-it-all
when I win...

Four times eight is 32.
One times zero is zero.

- $120,000.

All right, two lessons.

It's not as much as I thought,
but I'm still rich.

You're not rich...

...you lucky little pecker-head.

Hey, there's no reason for name-calling...

...Mr. Smart-Money.

You wanna walk home?

I don't have to walk home.

I could take a taxi or a limo.

Or a hearse.

Mmm.

You were so smart to bring this.

WOMAN
Now serving Number 97 at Window A.

Hey, that's me.

You hang in there. Thanks for everything.

You're welcome.

I was being facetious.

Ooh. Ninety-nine.

Lucky you.

I'm 138.

Been here all day...

...with my kid waiting in the car.

Nice try.

- Hey, Dad, guess what.
- Whoa, whoa, he doesn't need to know.

- Why not?
- Think about it.

What's your father gonna do
when he finds out you got $1120?

Don't worry, I'm not gonna lend him any.

No, you clod.

- He's gonna make you put it in the bank.
- Oh, yeah.

He's gonna give me grief
for taking you to the track.

Oh, so I guess that means
I've got leverage on you.

Hey, I can live with the grief.
Can you live without the money?

No. I love my money.

Okay, so here's what you do. Hide it
in your room some place no one will look.

I saw this movie where they put the money
in a plastic bag and hung it in the toilet.

Bad idea.
Your toilet sees way too much action.

Okay, I'll buy a big safe.

Oh, brilliant,
that won't raise any questions.

Just stick it in a shoe.

But what if I wanna wear it?

Then put it in a different shoe.

But not the same pair, right?

Correct.

You have to be careful spending it.
You don't wanna call attention to yourself.

Okay. I'll just get a plasma Tv.

No, no, no.

No plasma Tvs, no computers,
no expensive video games.

Buy small stuff that no one will notice.

- Like doughnuts?
- Okay. Perfect.

What about a doughnut machine?

Okay, you're not hearing me.

I could hide it in the safe.

Get out of here.

Hey, where have you been?

I told you. The DMV.

All day? You should have
made an appointment.

Yeah. Next time I'll know.

So, what did you guys do today?

Oh, not much.
We just hung out, ran a few errands.

- Did you help him with his book report?
- Yes, I did.

Really?

No.

- You said you'd help him.
- Yeah, you said...

...you'd only be living here
for a couple of weeks.

And you weren't drunk when you said it.

Fair enough. So you guys
just ran errands all day?

Yes, errands.

- Where is he, in his room?
- Yes, his room.

- Thanks for keeping an eye on him.
- No problem.

Oh, I have a bad feeling.

Hey, Jake, I'm back. I was thinking...

Uncle Charlie made me go to the track.

What a day.

Just sitting and sitting and sitting.

Huh.

It was like jury duty...

...without the fun
of sending someone to jail.

Sounds awful.

Yeah, yeah.

So...

...you guys ran errands today.

Little rat bastard sold me out, didn't he?

Almost immediately.

Why would you take a 13-year-old boy
to the track?

Hey, I thought it would be better than him
hanging around the house doing nothing.

He was supposed to be
doing his book report.

Oh, yeah.

And weren't you supposed to be working on
some big credit-card jingle?

I'm percolating.

Boy, you are some role model.

Well, one of us has to be.

So exactly how much did he win?

Eleven hundred dollars.

Wow.

Forget it. He's not gonna loan you any.

All right, we'll put it in the bank.
A nice addition to his college fund.

What college fund?

The one with $1100 in it.

Come on, Alan.

He won the money fair and stupid.

- So I ought to let him keep it?
- What's the worst that could happen?

So he blows it.

It's a life lesson
and we get a doughnut machine.

What?

- It's just money, Alan.
- Well, I don't want him to think like that.

Oh, much better he think like you?

Squirreling away every dime
so he'll have it handy...

...for alimony payments and phone sex?

For the last time, I misdialed.

Yeah, every Wednesday night
for 20 minutes.

Okay, we are not talking
about the phone bills.

We are talking about teaching Jake
sound financial principles.

And I am entitled to a date night.

Fine, take the money away from him.

- No, I'm not gonna be the bad guy.
- I'm not gonna be, either.

- Why not? It's your fault.
- If you wanna point the finger...

...look for the horse trainer who put
crystal meth in Mr. McGlue's feedbag.

I'll bet that Clydesdale is still running.

Okay, okay, you think you know him best?
We'll let him keep the money.

But mark my words.
No good can come from a boy like Jake...

...having that cash to throw around.
- Oh, come on, the kid might surprise you.

- Here's a hundred bucks.
- What's that for?

I broke a lamp.

It's the card that's accepted
All over the globe

Something, something

Terry-cloth robe

That's enough for today.

Hey, have you seen Jake?

Oh, Little Lord Fartleroy?

He wasn't pleased with grilled cheese
for lunch...

...so he walked to Red Lobster
for their all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.

- Wonderful.
- He lined his pockets with foil...

...before he left.

You think this is funny?

So the kid gets to throw money around.

- What's wrong with that?
Hey.

Richie Rich back with my crab legs yet?

No.

You don't understand.
Money gives him choices and freedom.

- Yeah, so?
- I don't have choices and freedom...

...why should he?
- Dad, Uncle Charlie.

Come out and see what I just bought.

Oh, I have another bad feeling.

Oh... Jake, where did you get that?

A guy had it in the back of his pickup truck
at the gas station. It had a "for sale" sign.

Oh, no.

I asked him how much it was
and he said, "How much you got?"

And I told him $1106 and he said,
"It's your lucky day."

Can you believe that?
That's two lucky days in a row.

Okay, I'm sorry.

- You did not ride that thing here?
- No, I pushed it.

- I can ride it on the beach.
- You figured wrong.

- It's too dangerous.
- Don't worry, I got a helmet.

I traded him for a bag of crab legs.

- Can you help me take it to the beach?
- You're not riding that.

Well, I bought it with my own money,
so you can't tell me what to do.

Really, I am as sorry
as I could possibly be.

Let me show you how cool it is.
Look, the guy told me how to start it.

He said it might need a tune-up.

So where are my crab legs?

Go ahead, say it.

- I'm stupid and I got ripped off.
- No, no, nobody thinks that.

I wouldn't say nobody.

- Charlie.
- Come on.

It's not the end of the world.

Look, Jake, sooner or later,
every guy gets hustled.

- Even you?
- Even me.

I remember when I wasn't
much older than you...

...I spent 100 bucks on a bag of oregano.

- Oregano?
- Your uncle was making spaghetti sauce.

Yeah, in a parked car...

...before I went
to the Pink Floyd Laserium show.

Thank you.

The important thing is you learn something
that will serve you for the rest of your life.

- What's that?
- Always buy motorbikes and oregano...

...from authorized dealers.

No. No. That is not the lesson.

- A fool and his money are soon parted?
- No.

- Don't run with scissors?
- Do you mind?

Go ahead.
I'm down to "don't eat the yellow snow."

That's not it, is it?

No, the lesson here is that when
a little extra money comes our way...

...we do the smart thing,
we put it in the bank.

It makes reasonable interest
at minimal risk.

And then we have it for a rainy day.

- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

Attaboy.

Trust me, there is no better feeling...

...than knowing you have a little nest egg
to fall back on.

There are at least eight better feelings.

Charlie!
- Coming.

.......... ********** ..........

- Gee, I'm sorry you have to go.
- I don't have to go.

I mean, I'm sorry I have work to do
so you can't stay.

Didn't you hear me? I can stay.

Yeah, I wish you could.

But there's no way
I'd be able to concentrate with you around.

Don't forget your sweater.

You know, you are so thoughtful.
Most guys aren't.

Most guys are selfish bastards
who just wanna use you...

...and throw you away. Heh.

Damn them.

Anything else you have might overlooked?

Cell phone, earrings, any medications?

Hang on. Nope, I'm all set.

Good, good.
Okay, well, I'll see you soon.

- How soon?
- Very soon.

- So you'll call?
- What do you think?

- I think you'll call.
- Well, there you go.

So when will you call?

- Soon.
- How soon?

We're back on this ride, huh?

Okay, very soon. Bye-bye, now.

- Ah. When will I learn?
Soon.

Very soon.

Don't tell me.
Tell the cockeyed optimist in my pants.

- So where'd you find this one?
- The animal shelter.

- Are we getting a pet?
- Are you crazy? We've already got your kid.

Then what were you doing there?

Standing within earshot
of attractive women and mumbling:

"Gee, I wish I could adopt them all."

It's foolproof.

There's something
that I need to talk to you about.

You know the difference
between you and me, Alan?

- I don't scream when I pee?
- I took care of that.

No, the difference between you and me
is I have vision.

- I see what others don't.
- Terrific. The thing I wanted to tell you...

You look at an animal shelter...

...and see homeless dogs
and kitties about to be put to death.

Me? I see an ass farm.

Okay, I'm speechless.

No words necessary.
Silent admiration is all I ask.

So, what is it you wanted to tell me?

The railing's a little loose.

Ah. I gotta stop falling off the deck sober.

Morning. How are you feeling?

Like I fell 8 feet onto splintered wood
and wet sand and a dead crab.

One would think your highly inflated ego
might have broken your fall.

So where'd you find Pancho Bob villa
out there?

You know those fliers
that get left in your mailbox?

- Yeah.
- Well, I take them...

...and file them according to category.

Takeout menus, rug sales,
carpet cleaning, plumbing, tiling.

Fernando was under
"handyman services."

You're gonna live here forever,
aren't you?

He's licensed, he's bonded, he's punctual,
and he's reasonably priced.

Are you paying him?

No, but I'm saving you 20 percent
with this valuable coupon.

Morning.

- Hey.
- Morning.

What in the heck is...?

Oh, yum.

- Who is that?
- He's a handyman.

Ooh. Nice. Can we keep him?
Can we? Can we?

He's just here to fix the deck.

Great, there's a lot of work
that can be done in here too.

Like what?

Well, for starters,
that cabinet door is coming off its hinges.

Really?

No, it's not.

Yeah, it is.

He looks parched. I'll take him some rum.

See, my problem is, is that I'm a giver.

I love too much,
and it's always the wrong man.

- You have romance in your heart.
- Oh, I have romance all over me.

I reek of it.

- Another mojito?
- Oh, no.

One is my limit
when I work with power tools.

That's smart.

We wouldn't want you
to lose one of those beautiful thumbs.

- Berta.
- What?

I... I just thought
that maybe it's almost lunchtime...

oh, yeah. Quesadilla, bright eyes?

- Thank you.
- Coming up.

- Actually, I'd rather have a sandwich.
- I'm making quesadillas.

Quesadilla's fine.

So, Fernando, how's it going?

I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you have a problem here.

Just don't let her corner you
in the laundry room and you'll be fine.

No, the deck.

- When's the last time you put sealant on it?
- Well...

Uh...

What?

Oh, seÃ±or, you cannot have wood untreated
this close to the ocean.

The moisture,
she gets in and rots it from the inside.

Where have I heard that before?

Right, my doctor.
But it wasn't moisture, it was Scotch.

You need to replace the railing,
parts of the deck...

...and the stairway to the beach.

Oh. Well, why can't I just
put on some of that sealant?

You could do that,
but it would be, as we say:

- What's that mean?
- Milking a dead cow.

Ah.

Well, uh, maybe before I commit
to all this work...

...I should get a second opinion.

I understand.
You're a smart and careful man.

But I would hurry up,
before your deck falls off.

Something else my doctor told me.

Hello?

Oh, uh...

Hang on, I'll... I'll see if he's here.

It's Chloe.

I need more than that, Alan.

The girl you adopted
at the animal shelter.

- God, she won't leave me alone.
- What do you want me to say?

- I don't know, tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

What do you have?

- What are you talking about?
- Well, are you bedridden or ambulatory?

- Uh, bedridden.
- Got it.

- Is it viral or bacterial?
- What?

Well, if I'm gonna lie convincingly,
I need details.

- I don't know, I got a bug.
- Intestinal or bronchial?

- Just tell her I got the flu, all right?
- Oh, good, the flu.

Is it coming out both ends?

Just give me the freaking phone.

No. It's okay, I wanna talk to her.

Hello, Chloe.

No, I'm fine. Just a little bug.

Doctor said I should be okay
in a couple of weeks.

Me too, baby. I'll call you.

Soon.

Very soon.

See? Was that so hard?

Well, to be fair, you had the advantage
of making it a performance piece.

Hey, dogs.

- Hey.
- Hey, Jake.

Alan, here, I need you to sign these papers
for Jake's summer school.

- Oh, summer school again?
- Why not? He's getting good at it.

Oh, my Lord. Who is that?

- He's my handyman.
- I've been looking for a good handyman.

- It's a little soon to know how good he is.
- I'll find out.

I'm starting to see a trend here.

That bony bitch.

Yep, definitely a trend.

Summer school three years in a row.

They might as well
just make you the janitor.

- Ah, well, school sucks.
- That's because you go year-round.

Imagine if you had a couple of months off
in the summer.

If I were you, I'd start teaching him
how to throw sawdust on vomit.

I could do that.

Why don't you just
go start your homework?

What's the point?
I'm already going to summer school.

- Jake.
- And if I flunk there, what can they do?

- Send me to regular school?
- Go.

Actually, that sawdust job
might be a pipe dream.

Is the big one gone?

Yeah, she went to get something waxed.

We were scared to ask what.

I just wanted to tell you I was able
to save you money on the redwood.

- That's terrific. How?
- My cousin.

He works at a lumberyard and...

That's all you need to know.

- Well, thanks.
- No problem. I'll get back to work.

- I like this guy.
- Course you do.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Charlie, he's a younger version of you.

Oh, yeah, that must be it.

I'll get it.
- There you go. He could be a doorman.

- I don't appreciate...
- I'm not saying right away.

He could work his way up from doorstop.

Uncle Charlie, it's Chloe.

- Aw, jeez, did you let her in?
- No, she's on the front porch.

- I told her I'd see if you were home.
- Thattaboy.

See? He'll make doorman in no time.

- She brought soup.
- Why would she bring soup?

You told her you had a bug,
so she assumed it was bronchial.

If you'd been more specific like I suggested,
you could have precluded this.

Nobody just drops by
when they think you have diarrhea.

And I bet they don't bring soup, either.

All right, all right.

I'm gonna sneak out the back door.
Just tell her I had a doctor's appointment.

G.P. Or specialist?

Alan, I swear to God, I will rip off your head
and use your neck as a bedpan.

- You cannot keep lying to this girl forever.
- Oh, I think I can.

Go out there, tell her you're not interested
in a relationship...

...and be done with it.

Yeah. I guess you're right.

I say we eat the soup before you tell her.

Smelled like minestrone.

Listen, Chloe, we need to talk.

Chloe?

Looks like your problem's solved.

Are you crazy?
That rat bastard is stealing my girlfriend.

Forget the girl, he's stealing our soup.

Hey, baby, thanks so much
for coming to see me.

Yeah, well, that's what friends are for.

So, um, Charlie,
did you know that Fernando volunteers...

...to build homeless shelters
in his spare time?

No, I didn't.
Did you know his cousin steals wood?

Really? That is fascinating.

Why don't you come on inside
so we can visit?

- I'll see you later, Fernando.
- Thank you for your thoughtful soup.

It nourishes my body
as your beauty nourishes my soul.

Find something to saw.

So, Chloe, what's new?

Huh? Oh, nothing.
What is he, like, Colombian?

I don't know.

But I gotta tell you,
I do feel much better seeing you.

God, it's like his eyes are looking
inside your soul.

Yeah. Kind of creepy.

The way he speaks, it's so romantic.

Hey, I almost forgot.

- I wrote you a song.
- Really?

Well, you've been on my mind a lot...

...and I wanted to find a way
to express my feelings.

What's it called?

Uh...

"Chloe's Song."

I haven't put any words to it yet,
but it goes something like this.

Can't you see?

You're everything I hoped for

You're everything I need

You are so beautiful

To me

You should use those words.

- Thanks again for stopping by.
- Yeah, I'm glad you're feeling better.

- So when am I gonna see you again?
- Soon.

- How soon?
- I'll call you. Bye, Fernando.

Oh, God.

Call me.

- You have a beautiful lady, SeÃ±or Harper.
- Thank you.

She must make you feel,
how do you say...

...young again?

Yeah. That's what I'm feeling.

Oh. Hey, Charlie, I was thinking, uh,
after Fernando's done with the deck...

...he could patch that hole in the roof
where the squirrels get in.

- I don't think so.
- Why not?

I like squirrels.

Hey, me too.

But they get into the crawlspace,
where they breed and die.

That's what I like about them, Alan.

I like their little hands.

Uh, come on, Charlie,
all Fernando would have to do...

Forget Fernando.

I'm having second thoughts
about him even finishing the deck.

- What? You wanna fire him?
- I don't want to.

I just don't think his work
is very professional.

I mean, he's wasting a lot of wood.

And, you know,
wood just doesn't grow on tree...

He's gotta go.

Charlie, you're not fooling anybody.
You're... You're jealous.

Jealous?

You know what's cooler than squirrels?
Anteaters. They're just crazy-looking.

I'm not jealous.

And their name tells you
what to feed them.

Why would you say I'm jealous?

I'm an omnivore.
That means I eat anything.

Yeah, we've noticed. Now shut up.

I'm not jealous.

You wanna fire this guy
because he's younger and better-looking.

And he can sing.

This has nothing to do with that.
And I can sing too.

Yeah, but you stink.

I am done for the day.
I'll see you in the morning?

Hold on, Fernando.

- I wanna talk to you.
- Yes?

- Never mind. Good night.
- Is there a problem?

Because I want everything
to be perfect for you.

You're a good man and I respect you.
You remind me of my sainted father.

Thank you.

He was wise and strong,
until syphilis made him crazy.

Again, thanks. Good night.

I thought you were gonna get rid of him.
Or did you go crazy there for a second?

I don't know, I just... I just couldn't.

Yeah, I think it's his eyes.

- It's like they're looking right into my soul.
- That's what Mom said.

- Women used to say that about my eyes.
- Really?

Because now they're kind of milky
and bloodshot.

Actually, the... The one on the right
is starting to look a little lazy.

- You know, you're right.
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

Come on, Charlie, you can't expect
to compete with a guy half your age.

I am not competing.

Well, you shouldn't,
because it's perfectly natural.

Each generation passes the torch on
to the next.

The child becomes the hunter.
The hunter becomes the revered elder.

When you're too old to chase the buffalo,
it's time to stay back with the old women...

...and make necklaces.

Necklaces?

Or weave blankets, tend the fire...

...teach the kids to whittle.

Buffalos are cool too.
They're like badass cows.

- Charlie.
- Yeah, hi.

I was just in the neighborhood
and thought I'd drop off your soup Thermos.

Thanks. What did you do to yourself?

Me? Nothing, nothing.
I was just doing a little work outdoors.

- Got some sun.
- Oh.

What's up with your teeth?

Oh, I just brushed them real good.

So can I come in?

Oh, gee, Charlie, I really...

- ...wish you would've called.
- Oh.

SeÃ±or Harper...

- I was, how do you say...?
- About to sleep with my girlfriend?

Okay, about to.

I am so sorry.

I would understand if you fired me.

Hey, it's no big deal, pal.
This is the natural course of events.

You're the next generation:
Young, vibrant, good-looking.

- You can buy Chloe expensive jewelry.
- I cannot buy her expensive jewelry.

Oh, right, that's me.

What do you say, Chloe?
Wanna go shopping?

I'll go get my purse.

And, yeah, you're fired.

Charlie, when are you coming
back to bed?

- Soon.
- How soon? Hee-hee.

I'll be right up, baby.

Okay, let me see if I got this right.

You bought diamonds
for the girl you were trying to get rid of...

...in order to win her
from the handyman you fired.

I'm sensing some judgment here.

You're very astute.

Okay, first of all,
I got Fernando another job.

But the most important thing
to remember is...

...I won.

You're a lecherous old guy...

...who bought a young woman's affection
with shiny baubles.

True. But I won.

Are you sure
we cannot open up a window?

No, I like it hot.

Okay, well,
time for the victor to reap the spoils.

Oh, Charlie, aren't you ashamed?

Alan, you know the difference
between you and me?

Yeah, I wouldn't fire the handyman
before he finishes.

Hey, I can see your teeth from up here.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh! Brain freeze. Brain freeze.

Hang in there, it'll pass.

Going. Going. Going...

okay, okay, I'm good.

Oh! Brain freeze. Brain freeze.

I don't think "brain freeze"
is an accurate description here.

Oh, jeez. It's Mom.

- Ah, great.
- Who's that she's with?

I don't know.
They haven't been dating long.

- How can you tell?
- He's still smiling.

- Let's get out of here before she sees us.
- How? They're standing in the door.

We'll go out the back.

Hey, look. I'm a rabid dog.

- Ah, damn it.
- Plan B?

- Bathroom.
But I don't have to pee.

Go! Go!

Now what? We just wait here
till they leave?

Would you rather go out there
and chat with Mom and her new boyfriend?

Hey, Evelyn, get me a muffin too.

Whoo!

Somebody was drinking
more than coffee.

Gonna be long?

I don't know.

And Bingo was his name-o

- All yours.
- Thanks.

Thanks.

So listen, when you guys
are done screwing around in here...

...your mother would like to talk to you.

Can I come out now?

Hey, look who's here.

It's Mom. Hi, Mom.

Oh, stop it, both of you.

I can't believe I'm such a horrible person,
you have to hide from me.

- We weren't hiding.
- Which does not invalidate your premise.

Uh, Jake had, uh, stomach problems.

Don't put this on me.

I apologize for my children.

No problem. Teddy Leopold.

Oh, hi. Uh, Alan.
This is my brother, Charlie. My son, Jake.

How you doing?

Evelyrs told me a lot of wonderful things
about you boys.

Not buying it, huh?

I tried.

Teddy lives in Denver,
but he does a lot of business in L. A...

...so I helped him find a pied-Ã -terre
in Century City.

What's a pied-Ã -terre?

It's French for a place
to play hanky-panky with Grandma.

- Mom!
- Mom!

Oh, relax, it's not gonna scar him.

Yeah, but what about us?

Well, it was nice meeting you.

- We've gotta bring the kid to his mother's.
- Again you're putting it on me?

Nice to meet you too.

Yeah, bye-bye. See you, Mom.

- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

Wait, I have to pee.

You've peed enough.

Teddy Leopold.
Do we know a Teddy Leopold?

It's Mom's new boyfriend.

Oh, right, of course.

- Aren't you curious why he's calling?
- Not particularly.

What if something happened to Mom?

Then we'll just wait for Dorothy
to bring us the broom.

Give me the phone.

Hello?

Uh, no, no, this is Alan.
Hi, Teddy. What's up?

Uh-huh.

Oh...

Wow. Heh.

That is quite an offer.

I... I'd love to.

Hang on, I'll ask him.

- Teddy has invited us...
- I'm busy.

- You at least wanna hear what it is?
- Nope.

Charlie can't make it,
but can you still take me?

Really? Heh-heh. Gee, thanks.

I'll, uh... Guess I'll see you then.

You're gonna be sorry.

You're gonna be homeless.

Why do you always have to play
that card?

Look, Alan, I have no interest in hanging
out with Mom's boyfriend du jour.

Why not? He seems like a great guy.

He might be the greatest guy...

...but he'll end up like every other husband
or boyfriend she's ever had.

Either she'll dump him, he'll dump her,
or he'll die under suspicious circumstances.

No matter what,
you're left standing on the curb...

...with your fishing pole
on the first day of summer vacation...

...waiting for a Chrysler LeBaron
that never comes.

Okay, this isn't about Teddy, is it?

Hey, hey. You wanna be buddies
with this guy, go right ahead.

I've got better things to do.

Better than ringside seats
to the Heavyweight Championship fight...

...at Caesars Palace tomorrow night?

What?

Ringside.

- Ringside?
- Any closer...

...and we'd be sitting in the spit bucket.

Should I call him back
and tell him you changed your mind?

No, no. No.

He's just using us to get closer to Mom.

When we were kids
it was Disneyland and cotton candy.

Now it's ringside seats.

- And a private plane.
- He's got a private plane?

And a limo and a penthouse suite.

Oh.

- Still not interested?
- No.

- Still have better things to do?
- Yup.

Ah. Do you realize what a stubborn child
you sound like?

I do.

- You're not gonna give it up, are you?
- Not a chance.

Okay, then, good night.

Good night.

Oh, boy, Teddy's here.

Charlie, Teddy's here.

Oh, boy.

Hi, Al, you all packed?

Are you kidding? I packed last night.

I was too excited to sleep.

Terrific.

- Where's Charlie?
- Out on the deck.

- Give me a minute, I wanna say hi.
- All right.

- Can I go sit in the limo?
- Knock yourself out.

There's sushi.

Sushi in a car. Oh, boy.

This is your other plans?

Not all of them. Later I'm gonna go inside
and watch some girl-on-girl porn.

Beautiful.

Look, I still have an extra ticket to the fight
and there's plenty of room on the plane.

No, thanks.

Did I do something to tick you off?

You know,
aside from slipping it to your mother.

No, no. It's just I'd prefer
not to get involved in her personal life.

I'm not asking you to get involved
in her life.

I'm asking you to come to vegas
with me and see a fight.

Yeah, but why?

I don't know, you seem like a nice guy.

- Don't you have your own friends?
- Charlie, when you get to be my age...

...most of your friends
are either married or dead.

What's the difference?

The dead ones smell up my plane.

Come on, throw some clothes on
and let's go have some fun.

Ah, what the hell.

Just do me a favor.
Let's keep this between us.

I want your mother to think
that I went on a business trip.

No problem.
My mother still thinks I went to college.

Beautiful.

Hey, Charlie? You need anything?

Teddy, if I was any happier,
my pants would be wet.

Hey, Teddy, can we get some gelato
after the fight?

Anything you want, kid.

Gee, thanks.

Hiya.

What's up?

Yeah. I've never really been a big fan
of the pugilistic arts...

...but I have to admit, I'm getting kind of
swept away in the pageantry of the event.

Uh-huh.

I like your bling very much.

I, uh, tried a pierced ear once,
but it got horribly infected.

Hey, uh, you know
where we could score some good gelato?

No.

Word.

I think that might be that Snoopy fella.

Terrific.

Hello?

Oh, hi, Evelyn. Yeah.

How are you, sweetheart?

Good, good.

Where am I?

San Francisco.

Uh, I'm going into a meeting, uh,
can I call you back?

Love you too, sweetie. Love you.

You're very good.

Yeah.

I've got 5 grand on the big Russian.

Either of you fellas
like to have a piece of my action?

- I'll take half.
- Attaboy.

How about you, Alan?

Aw, what the heck, I'm in vegas.
Heh-heh.

Put me down for 20...

No, $25.

Make it 20.

One. Two. Three. Four.

- Five. Six.
- How do you say "get up" in Russian?

Seven. Eight.

Nine. Ten.

Unbelievable.

An 18-second fight.

It takes me longer to start peeing.

Yeah, thanks so much for giving me
half your action on the guy.

No problem. You want the other half?

No, I'm good.

Oh, yeah, baby.

Twenty dead presidents. I'm even.

Was he a preemie?

Actually, we both were.

My mom waits nine months for nothing.

Hey, fellas,
I wanna show you something.

What do you think?

- Nice.
- Yeah. Who's it for?

- Your mother.
- No, seriously.

I know it's kind of old-fashioned,
but I wanted to run it by you guys...

...before I asked her.

Ask her what?

Charlie, I love your mom.

I wanna marry her.

But... But you could do so much better.

That's no way to talk about your mother.

That's precisely the way
to talk about my mother.

Charlie, be supportive.

I thought I was being supportive.

Regardless of what you guys think
about her, Evelyn is a great broad.

I wanna marry her
and I would like your blessing.

- You've got my blessing, Teddy.
- Shut up and eat your gelato.

Come on, Charlie, wouldn't it be great
to have a dad again?

I'm a grown man, Alan.

I don't need a father anymore.

Would any of you gentlemen like a date?

Sorry, doll, I'm taken.

But I wouldn't mind footing the bill
for my two boys here.

Hi, I'm Amber.

I'm Tiffany.

- Thanks, Daddy.
- Thanks, Daddy.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

How was work?

You don't care about my work.

- What's under the pillow?
- Hey, hey, hey.

Modern Bride?

- I just read it for the articles.
- Really?

Okay. I was looking for ideas
because I thought it would be nice...

...if we had the wedding for Teddy
and Mom here in the house.

Oh, my God.

You're a mind reader.

I didn't wanna bring it up,
because I was afraid you might say no.

But I was up all night doing research.

Now, I'm thinking a sunset ceremony with
the guests gathered on the beach below...

...as the bride and groom cross onto the
deck wearing Polynesian wedding garb...

...surrounded by tropical flowers
and tiki torches.

Okay, what about it don't you like?

Because I was a little iffy
on the tiki torches.

You're a little iffy in so many ways.

Okay, we can hammer out
the details later.

The thing to remember
is we're doing this for someone we love.

- Teddy.
- Teddy.

Okay, I'm out of here.

- Berta, did you hear the news about Mom?
- Yeah, she joined the Mormon Church...

...so she can get a rent-controlled
apartment in Salt Lake City.

Oh, you mean your mom. No.

We're getting a new dad.

- His name is Teddy.
- He took us to a boxing match.

He bought us prostitutes and gelato.

Well, congratulations.

I'm real happy for you, boys.

- Thanks.
- Thanks.

I think my news was far more interesting.

- I'm gonna call Teddy, tell him our plan.
- Oh, great.

Ask him how he feels about tiki torches.

- Hey, Teddy, it's Charlie.
- And Alan. Hi, Teddy.

Yeah, Alan says hi.

Listen, we've been thinking
about the wedding...

Tiki torches.

What?

- You're kidding.
- What?

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Wow. I don't believe it.

- What?
- Mom turned him down.

Ah! That bitch.

Gee, Teddy, I don't know what to say.
I... I feel terrible.

Well, this doesn't mean
we couldn't still hang out, right?

So you'll call us?

Great. Great, look forward to it.
All right. Bye-bye.

I know that tone of voice.
We'll never hear from him.

No tiki torches?

I don't understand.
How could Mom say no to him?

- He was perfect for her.
- Forget her. He was perfect for us.

I'm closing the door to my heart, Charlie.

It just hurts too much.

Screw it, this isn't over. Come on.

Where are we going?

We are gonna talk some sense
into our mother.

Really? It's hard to imagine
that turning out well.

Mom?

Mom, where the hell are you?

- Maybe she's not home.
- She's home.

Her car's in the driveway,
the alarm's not on. Mom!

Boys, I gave you that key for emergencies,
not to barge in on me like the Gestapo.

We wanna talk to you about Teddy.

Teddy? Why in the world
would you wanna talk about Teddy?

- Because we love Teddy.
- And you broke his heart.

Hang on a second, you met the man
for five minutes in a coffee shop.

Well, it was a good five minutes.

Evelyn? Hey, what the hell's going on?

I'll be right with you, sweetie.

Look, this is not the best time.

Come on, Evie,
the viagra's starting to make my ears burn.

- Who are these clowns?
- Oh, Hugo, darling...

...these are my sons, Charlie and Alan.

Wait a minute,
you didn't tell me you had any kids.

I sure didn't sign on for any kids.

Just give me a minute, darling.
I'll be right with you.

If I wanted to see any kids,
I'd go visit my own.

How old are these nuts?

From over here,
they look about a hundred.

Mom, what about Teddy?

Can we please have this conversation
another time?

No, no. No, we are having it right now.

What do you want me to say?

Teddy's fine, I like Teddy.

But he's ready to settle down
and I'm not.

I want my freedom.

Okay, I get freedom, but come on,
Teddy's way better than this guy.

As I said, Teddy's fine...

...but there are some areas in which
he just doesn't measure up to Hugo.

- Oh, God!
- Oh, Mom!

It's the biggest I've ever seen.

Makes it worth eating dinner at 3:30.

- But... But Teddy...
- I don't wanna hear it.

You have no say in this.

This is my life,
and right now I don't wanna be tied down.

I want options.

Hugo?

Hugo?

Oh, God, no.
Quick, somebody give me the phone.

Come on, come on.

- Here, here, here.
- Oh, God.

Come on, come on, come on.
Hello, Teddy?

Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in.

I hope you can forgive me, Teddy.

I just needed time to think about it.

It's like they say, "You don't know
what you've got till it's gone."

Yes.

Yes, my darling, I love you too.

Well, I'll be right over.

Mwah.

Could someone please
put a sheet over him?

Mom, shouldn't we call 911?

Well, call whoever you want,
the man is dead.

You're really gonna leave
and go to Teddy's?

Well, I can't very well
invite him over here.

All right. She's going back to Teddy.

Hey, hey, hey, a little respect?

Oh... oh, yeah.

- Okay. Who's our daddy?
- Teddy!

Right.

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, Berta, how have you been
washing my underwear?

Like I do everything else around here:

With a song on my lips
and love in my heart.

I'm serious.

I got a rash in my, you know,
private area.

Private? You get more traffic
you're gonna have to open a Starbucks.

I thought maybe
you'd changed laundry soap...

...because it's all red and itchy,
especially around...

Excuse me.

I'm sitting here
eating a breakfast sausage.

It's not a sausage problem.

It's more in the meatball area.

Kind of meatball adjacent.

I bet it's swamp ass.

What's swamp ass?

Don't worry,
you'd know if you had swamp ass.

Man, I hate swamp ass.

- You sure it's just a rash?
- What else could it be?

Since we're talking about your area...

...it could be anything
from Ebola to mad cow disease.

You get Ebola from monkeys, right?

Right.

It's just a rash.

A kid at school got swamp ass.
Cats followed him around for a year.

- You know what? Let's forget about it.
- Oh, if only we could.

Speaking of school,
we've got a big day ahead of us.

Gotta go shopping for supplies, clothes.

Nice segue, Dad.

Well, the subject was crying out
for change.

You're starting a new school.
You're gonna need new stuff.

Wait a sec.
Melon Head made it into junior high?

- Yes.
- So you passed summer school?

- Sort of.
- What do you mean "sort of"?

They said it was in everyone's
best interest if I moved on.

What's that mean?

Promoted him.
He's starting junior high.

And there's absolutely nothing
to be gained in asking how or why.

Okay, well, whatever.
I'm proud of you, man.

- For what?
- I don't know...

...hanging in there
till they were sick of you.

Thanks.

So junior high, huh?

Boy, that brings back some memories,
doesn't it?

Can we please not go down that road?

What happened?

Nothing. It's just that kids
in junior high can be a little judgmental.

Especially if you're knocked up.

Thank you, Berta.

Of course, on the upside...

...the pregnant chicks
didn't have to go to gym.

Did the guys who got them pregnant get
considerations? No, not even a hall pass.

Are we quite done?

Things will go great for you.

- You just have to remember a few things.
- Like what?

Well, always keep
your lunch money in your shoe...

...but have some spare change
in your pocket.

- How come?
- Decoy money.

They won't stop hitting you
till they get something.

Who are "they"?

The kids holding your ankles,
plunging your head in the toilet.

Plunging my head in the toilet?

Don't freak the kid out, Alan.

It's not so much plunging as dipping.

Here's what you do:

Make friends with the janitor.
They usually have their own bathroom.

- Okay.
- Just never drink out of his Thermos.

All right.

And don't believe he loves you.

Damn it,
I miss that one-eyed son of a bitch.

And if you have to shower
after gym class...

...there is no shame
in keeping your jockey shorts on.

- Really?
- Okay, there's a little shame.

The important thing is the fellas
won't be calling you Shrinky Dink.

- Shrinky Dink?
- I'm a grower, not a shower.

Oh, I almost forgot.

I got you a little present.

- Your very own cell phone.
- Oh, cool.

The important thing
to remember is this is not a toy.

- It's to use in emergencies only.
- Emergencies? What emergencies?

"Dad, come get me.

I'm stuffed in my locker
and my underwear is wet."

That only happened once.

If that dog hadn't found you,
you'd have missed Thanksgiving.

- Drug-sniffing dog?
- There were no drugs.

That's true. Turns out those dogs
are also sensitive to urine.

I was in there for five hours.

Five hours?

But you don't have to worry about that.
You have a cell phone.

Which you should hide where
prisoners of war hid their watches.

- Where was that?
- Moving on.

I've preprogrammed the phone:

Speed dial one is me,
two is the nurse's office...

...and three is the police.

The police? What for?

You'll know it when it happens.

Now, about race riots...

- Try not to take sides.
- Anybody asks, you're mulatto.

- How do they feel?
- Okay, but they're ugly.

They look like old-people shoes.

They're not old-people shoes.
They're walking shoes.

Right, for people
who've been walking for 85 years.

I'd rather get these. These are cool.

Listen, junior high
is not about being cool.

It's about
not getting mugged for sneakers.

I can get mugged for my sneakers?

Not those sneakers.

Not unless you go by
an assisted-living facility...

...in a rough neighborhood.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry. This rash is driving me crazy.

I feel stupid in these.

Better to feel stupid
than to be tied to a flagpole...

...while upperclassmen
use you as a spittoon.

I don't wanna be tied to a flagpole.

You won't be. Wear the ugly shoes
and don't sit at the wrong table.

Wrong table?
How will I know if it's the wrong table?

You'll be tied to a flagpole, right, Alan?

That also only happened once.

Let's just check the fit.

Good.

Plenty of room for lunch money.

How come all my clothes
have to be beige?

Because beige is not the color
of any known gang.

Right, instead of being mistaken
for a Crip or a Blood...

...you'll be mistaken for a Band-Aid.

Hey, Band-Aids are ouchless.

Excuse me? Excuse me, there's a line.

- Yeah, I just got a couple of things.
- I can see that...

...but it's not based
on quantity of items.

It's more of a
"we were here before you" kind of deal.

You gonna make a thing out of this?

There's no thing.
Just playing by the rules.

And wouldn't it be nice
if everybody did the same?

Hang on to this, slick.

Now, you wanna explain
those rules again, jughead?

You know what? If you're in a hurry,
why don't you go ahead?

Thank you.

What the hell are you doing?

Nothing. Here.

No, no, not chicken.
Just good common sense.

- Fighting accomplishes nothing.
- Oh, I didn't know you were so French.

- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Julie.

How do you know my wife?

What? Oh, no, no, no, I don't know her.

You said, "Hey, Julie."

No, no, I sneezed.

- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

Oh, look, another cashier opened up.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

But Mom said I could wait
for the bus by myself.

I know.

I would really rather wait
for the bus by myself.

I just wanna make sure
you get off okay.

Yeah, but being walked to the bus stop
by my dad and my uncle?

I'm gonna look so lame.

Jake, buddy, that ship has sailed.

Please don't leave me.

You're okay.
Just don't make eye contact.

Okay, when the bus comes,
don't take a window seat.

You don't wanna be trapped
and get pummeled.

- Pummeled?
- And be polite to the driver.

They tend to be damaged people
with short fuses.

- Fuses?
- Don't distract him.

There's no seat belts.

One sharp turn, and you kids
will be flying like lotto balls.

Balls?

Wait, wait, wait.

- Smile.
- About what?

I need a current picture
in case you go missing.

Alan, you're being ridiculous.
They never find those kids.

Give me a profile.

Okay, now go make it a great day.

Have fun.

I just hope everything turns out all right.

Well, we've done all we could.
Now it's up to him.

Okay. Okay.

Tell the doctor that if I was a tree...

...the rash is predominantly
around the mossy trunk area.

But I'm starting to see some redness
on the adjacent boulders.

Oh, come on.

Tree, two boulders,
what part don't you understand?

- Hey.
- Hey.

Okay, just have him call me.

- Heard from Jake?
- Nope.

I'll call him at his mom's,
see how school went.

- Alan, does this look infected to you?
- What?

Get that away from me.

I'm not asking you to tickle it.
Just take a look.

No, thank you.

But you're a doctor.

I'm a chiropractor.
I work with vertebrae.

And contrary to popular belief,
there is not a single bone in the penis.

Oh, hi, Judith.

Nothing. I was just talking to Charlie.

Hey, hey, is Jake home
from school yet?

No?

Okay, I was just
wondering how his first day went.

Have him call me, okay?
Thanks, bye-bye.

Hope he didn't wander
under bleachers during lunch.

- He's smarter than that.
- Smart?

He only got out of sixth grade
because he couldn't fit in the desks.

If you're that concerned,
just call him on his cell.

Good idea.

Jake? Jake, where are you?

You're still on the bus.

Funny, I don't hear the other kids.

Oh, yeah, it was a tough day.
Everybody's tired.

No kidding.

Dad, this phone
is for emergencies only.

Why aren't you at your mother's?

I got off the bus at school,
got on another bus and came here.

- So you've never been to school today?
- Of course not.

I don't wanna be stuffed in a locker,
tied to a flagpole or dunked in a toilet.

Not dunked. Dipped.

- And where are your new sneakers?
- Oh, I sold them to the bus driver.

Charlie, can I talk to you a minute?

- Are those my comics?
- Charlie.

They're near mint
and he wipes his boogers all over them.

He was here all day
and you didn't know?

Hey, I've got a rash.

I can't believe he cut school
on his first day.

When you think about it,
it's pretty smart.

As far as the school is concerned,
he might just be a typo.

Charlie, the question
is why did he cut school?

Oh, that's easy.

You scared the crap out of him
and dressed him like an ace bandage.

Hey, hey,
I was just trying to prepare him.

For what? A life of running and hiding?

No, no, a life of blending in.

Only if they see you,
running and hiding.

Face it, Alan. When the lord
was handing out courage...

...you were crouched in a locker,
peeing on your socks.

Okay, first of all,
I had had three Mr. Pibb's at lunch.

And secondly, I am not a coward.

Come on. I've seen steelier nerves
from a cat on the freeway.

That's ridiculous.

Dingo.

Okay, I was not ready and that was
not fair. And what about you?

- What about me?
- You're afraid of everything.

- Like what?
- Well, let's see.

Germs, change,
opening your eyes underwater...

...angry husbands, angry ex-girlfriends,
large birds, spiders and Mom.

Hold on.

Hold on a sec.

I am not afraid to open my eyes
underwater, I'm just sensitive to chlorine.

- Right.
- And for the record...

...it's just when birds get indoors.

In the sky, I got no problem.

Fine, fine. Live in denial.

I'm gonna straighten my kid out.

And what sane person
is not afraid of spiders?

What I'm trying to say
is that it was wrong to fill your head...

...with a lot of horrible things
to avoid at school.

Because the truth is
you can't avoid any of them.

Charlie.

You don't want him living in fear.

- Well, yeah, but I was...
- Well, scary things happen in life.

- He can hide like you...
- Like us.

Don't nitpick.

Or you can stand up to them.

I mean, look,
getting hit in the face hurts.

- But you know what hurts more?
- A kick in the crotch?

Well, yeah, sure.

I took a soccer ball to the nads once,
thought my eyes were gonna pop out.

Yeah, but that pain passes.

What hurts more
and lasts longer than anything...

...is the humiliation of running away.

I couldn't ride my bike for a week.

Jake, I think you're missing the point.

Makes you wonder what they're doing
hanging down there in the first place.

No, what I think Uncle Charlie
is trying to say...

...is that, yeah, you might get hit,
you might get stuffed in a locker...

...but you know what? You'll survive.

You may get bruised, you may bleed,
you may lose a few teeth...

...but you'll have your self-respect.

- Exactly.
- How do you stop being afraid?

Well, I drink.

But I didn't start till ninth grade.

Yeah, Judith.
He was at Charlie's the whole time.

Well, he said
he was too scared to go to school.

How should I know why he's so scared?

Maybe you're overprotective.

Good one.

I know you mean well.

Oh, all right.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

Okay. Bye-bye.

- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, it's Mom's fault.

Attaboy.

Come on, it's green. Let's go.

What's the matter with this guy?

Looks like he's coming to tell you.

Lock your doors. Lock your doors.

Wait, no, no, wait.
I am tired of running and hiding.

- Are you tired of running and hiding?
- Yes, I am.

Remember, Jake,
courage is not the absence of fear...

...it's taking action despite fear.

That's very true.

- Let's do this.
- Right behind you.

Two against one wouldn't be fair.

Now, that's courage.
Aren't you proud of him?

You got your cell phone?

It's only for emergencies.

Help me.

I think this qualifies.

Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

- Hello?
- Hi.

Charlie. Charlie.

You are a bad brother.

I really thought you had him.

Mr. Harper, try not to sneeze.
You'll blow those stitches right out.

Thank you, doctor.

Hey, doc, while I got you here,
let me show you something.

Oh, my goodness.
Your little jimmy's all crimson.

Yeah.

So, what do you think?

Well, it looks like an allergic reaction.

You been applying anything
to your genital region?

The usual, waitresses and actresses.

Oh, wait, wait.
Does Grecian Formula count?

Grecian Formula?

You tried to get gray
out of your pubic hair?

I wanted to leave silver
around the sides.

You know, look distinguished.

Distinguished? That's interesting.

We have a saying in my country:

"You can put a tuxedo on a goat,
but it's still a goat."

Yeah, well,
we have a saying in my country too:

"Help me, my balls are on fire."

Fair enough. I'll get you some salve.

How about that? Allergic reaction.
Nothing to be scared of.

All's well that ends well, right?

What did they give you for the pain?

You lucky bastard.

I wish my balls hurt more.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Okay, okay, okay.
It's your birthday.

We're going to a ball game,
only got three tickets.

- Cool.
- It's not his birthday.

- What else you get me?
- Not your birthday.

- Charlie, what's going on?
- I've got a delicate situation.

- I need to appear as if I have plans.
- Does your situation have a name?

I'm sure she does.
Just follow my lead.

- Dodgers or Angels?
- Let's say Dodgers.

See, the kid knows how to do this.

I'll get my mitt. Oh, boy, a ball game.

- Now, that's commitment.
- That's not commitment.

That's lead paint in the nursery.

Hey, Steve, you down there?

Oh, yeah, and my name's Steve.

Coming.

Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to some
poor woman so you can dump her.

I am not dumping her.

We've just grown apart.

Since you picked her up
at a bar last night?

People change.

Hello?

Oh, God.

In here, Mom.

So, what are my boys up to today?

We're going to a Dodger game,
and we've only got three tickets.

So you're on your way to a ball game.

Yep. It's a little treat
for Jake's birthday.

That was months ago.

We were waiting for bobblehead day.

It's good for Jake
to see other bobbleheads.

Hey, Dad, I just checked online.

The Dodgers are in San Francisco today.

Yes, well, we'd better get going then.

It's quite a drive.

Must you continue
with this pathetic, little charade?

At this point, we're kind of committed.

All right, we're not going to a ball game.

We're not?
Man, this is the worst birthday ever.

Why do you have to lie to me?

We don't have to.
It's a choice we make.

Well, you both might find this
all amusing.

But I do have feelings, and I can be hurt.

Sorry, Mom.

It's just crushing to know
that my own sons think so little of me.

Really? After all this time?

Charlie.

We're both sorry.
Is there anything we can do?

Well, as a matter of fact there is.

Oh, you just walked right into that.

Teddy is out of town,
and I need an escort...

...for the Civic Light Opera benefit
this evening.

Why don't you try
one of those escort services?

Charlie, if I were gonna pay
$200 per hour for a man...

...I would not be taking him
to the opera.

That's fair.

Well, I'd love to help you out, Mom,
but I have a date tonight.

Oh, so now it's inflatable-sex-doll night
at Dodger Stadium.

No.

No, I really have a date.

And the doll was a gag gift
from one of my patients.

Charlie, what about you?

I tried it once, but I prefer
a real woman.

Do you have plans this evening?

Oh, l... Well...

Hey, Steve.

In here.

As a matter of fact, I do have plans.

I have a very special lady friend
over for the weekend.

And here she is now. Hey, baby.

Hi.

Excuse me.

Isn't she something?

Okay, but get a town car,
because I ain't going sober.

Your town car's here.

Terrific.

Come on.

I have been to these things with Mom,
and I know you think it's gonna be bad.

But believe me, it's gonna be worse
than you can even imagine.

You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

You just love seeing me unhappy.

Well, yeah.

Did you feel sorry for me
when I had to wear that cowboy outfit...

...to her celebrity AIDS hoedown?

- That was different.
- How?

It was you.

Yeah, well, now it's you.

Yippee kay yay, mother accompanier.

Want a few tips?

Like what?

Well, let's see.

Mom likes to starve herself
for a few days before these...

...so she can fit into her gown.

That means she'll be knocking back
vodka gimlets on an empty stomach.

- Oh, jeez, she can be a cranky drunk.
- Cranky?

I got bitch-slapped
with my own 10-gallon hat.

So, what's the tip?
Don't wear a 10-gallon hat?

All you have to do is bring along
a little baggie of crackers...

...you know, saltines, Goldfish.

Anything you can stuff down her throat
to soak up the booze.

How about a throw pillow?

Oh, oh, and whatever you do,
don't let her take off her shoes.

- Why not?
- Well, A,

...you'll be carrying them all night,
and B...

...you'll wind up giving her
a foot massage.

That's not something
anybody wants to see.

Oh, God.

Not to mention the fact
that it puts you on bunion patrol.

Anyway, have fun.

I'm off to pick up a beautiful, smart,
funny, sexually-available woman...

...who, best of all, is not my mother.

Give it time. You'll get her there.

In consideration of the evening
you have ahead of you...

...I'm gonna let you have that one.

Yeah, these are the good times.

Another gimlet, please.

You sure you don't want a Wheat Thin?

Wheaty.

No, I need the liquor to dull the pain.

My shoes are killing me.

Yeah, but they look wonderful on your
feet, right where they are now.

- Oh, look who's over there.
- Who?

One of the most powerful
union leaders in Hollywood.

What about him?

- Really? The mob?
- Yeah.

They say he killed a writer once
just to make a point.

What was the point?

"I can kill a writer."

- And the silver-haired man he's talking to.
- Yeah?

That is the king
of vaginal-rejuvenation surgery.

But, interestingly,
he's never used one himself...

...rejuvenated or otherwise.

Wouldn't that make him
the queen of vaginal surgery?

Good for you, Charlie.

I wish I'd thought of that.

And from now on, I did.

It's yours.

So, what other dirt you got?

Oh, darling, you know,
I don't like to speak ill of anyone.

All right.

Bankrupt, embezzler, tushie tuck,
bigamist, pill freak.

And that one over there?

Underwent surgery to have a cell phone
removed from his lower intestine.

- How in the world did it get there?
- One can speculate.

But I have it on good authority
that it was set to vibrate.

How do you know all these things?

Oh, Charlie,
it's my business to know these things.

High-end real estate is all about gathering
information and forging relationships.

Hello, Beatrice, darling.

Lovely to see you,
you two-dollar whore.

You know, Mom, it's great
to watch you doing autopsies...

...when I'm not the cadaver.

Half the fun is sharing
with someone you love.

You see that statuesque woman
over there?

The one with the knock-off
Prada handbag?

Don't tell me. She's not a woman.

Oh, she's a woman.

She's an amazing woman.

She built a children's hospital
in Guatemala.

Yeah, and...?

Once they're healthy enough to walk,
she flies them to Los Angeles...

...and leases them out to celebrities
as household slaves.

Hello, dear.

I'm trying to sell her home.

Kind of hard to put a good spin
on media-room-slash-dungeon.

I'm sorry, Alan. I can't do this.

Sure you can. I mean, you are.

And if you'll allow me to say so,
you're pretty good at it.

It's not you, it's me.

- Yeah, right.
- What is that supposed to mean?

Sharon, I have been rejected
by 32 different women in my life.

And you know what?
It's never been me.

Okay, it's you. Feel better?

Actually, no.

You're a very nice guy.

That's even worse. You know
what they say about nice guys.

Yes, they finish last.

No, they finish in the shower.

What do you want? I can't help
if I'm not sexually attracted to you.

Yes, you can.
You just have to make an effort.

You know those jokes
you don't get right away?

And then in a day or two,
you find yourself laughing and laughing?

That's me.

I'm one of those jokes.

You'll sleep with me now,
and you'll be attracted to me later.

Please, Sharon, just give me a chance.

Oh, what the hell.

Good to see you, dear.

You look marvelous. For a heroin addict.

Let me ask you something.

If you don't like any of these people,
why do you come?

Charlie, do you read the paper?

Do you have any idea what the Los
Angeles real-estate market is like now?

Can't say I do.
How are those feet feeling?

- You wanna put your shoes back on?
- No one is selling unless they have to.

Which means, I have to be out
working these rooms every night...

...to learn who's getting divorced,
who's dying, can't make bail...

...whose crappy sitcom got canceled.

I mean, let's face it.
I'm not a young woman anymore.

In the old days, I could find out
all that stuff at home on my back.

Evelyn.

Margaret, good to see you.

- How's married life?
- Oh, just one long honeymoon.

That's because she bangs
a different groom every night.

Hi. Charlie Harper.

Oh, my God.

That was amazing.

Wasn't that amazing?

I hate myself.

What? No, no, no, you were great.

You did a crackerjack job.

Why do I always do this? Why do I have
this constant need to degrade myself?

Would it help to cuddle?

Don't touch me.

Okay. No touching.

The image of you lying on top of me
will haunt me forever.

Did you wanna be on top?

Because if you give me a half an hour
and a glass of juice, we can try that.

Hi, hi, Dr. Phillips. It's me, Sharon.

I did it again.

I don't know why.

I felt sorry for him.

Hey, hey, why don't I whip us up
some French toast?

Shut up.

Okay, I'm just gonna get a nice glass
of cran-apple just in case.

How bad was it?

How bad was it? I'm in a fold-out bed.

Morning.

Morning.

Hey, Berta, you're a woman...

Where are we going with this, zippy?

I was just wondering.

What does it mean when someone
starts crying uncontrollably...

...after sex?

Well, in my experience,
it usually means the conjugal visit's over.

Right. Thanks.

What happened?
You get yourself a weeper?

Yeah. Yeah, last night.

I've never seen anything like it before.

That's hard to believe.

I got it.

Hello?

Oh, hey, Mom. How are you?

Yeah, that was fun last night.

No, I'm not doing anything. Why?

Sure. I'd love to go shopping with you.

Great. I'll see you then.

What?

- Nothing.
- Nothing.

Hey, hey, Mom's not that bad.

In fact,
she's kind of fun to hang out with.

That has to be the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

You know, I said the same thing
to myself just a couple minutes ago.

- You sure you can't stay for dinner?
- Oh, I'd love to, sweetie.

But Teddy's back in town,
and Mommy plans to get laid tonight.

Well, good for you.
Please, give him my best.

Only after I give him my best.

- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Alan.

Don't forget your little gifty.

You bought him a gifty?

My way of saying,
"Thank you for lunch."

You took her to lunch?

I must have gained 5 pounds.

Oh, stop. You have a terrific figure.

Thank you.

Are you high?

It never hurts to pay a compliment
to someone you care about.

Yeah, you should try it
once in a while.

Might cut down
on that postcoital weeping.

How did you know about that?

Berta told me, I told Mom.

Your brother and I
don't have any secrets.

Maybe I'm high.

Okay, well, I must be off.

Places to go, houses to sell,
new widows to cold call.

Oh, oh, that reminds me.

Charlie, some woman named Margaret
called looking for you.

Margaret?

Oh, yeah, Honeymoon Margaret
from last night.

Charlie.

The woman's husband
is one of my biggest clients.

- Oh, Mom.
- Please, I'm not asking as your mother.

I'm asking as your friend.

All right, as a friend, hands off.

Thank you, darling.

I love you.

See you, Alan.

I guess I'll just throw this away.

What?
You're not gonna call her, are you?

Well, it's a bit of a dilemma.

On the one hand,
there's this beautiful, available woman.

- She's married.
- According to Mom...

...not a fanatic about it.

So am I the kind of guy who would go
back on his word to his own mother...

...just for a really hot one-night stand?

Is that a rhetorical question?

Tell you what.

We'll leave it to chance.

If I miss, I'll take the high road.

If it goes in, I'll call Margaret.

I guess it's fate.

Are you ready for me?

Oh, bravo.

Just to be clear,
this is a tit for tat kind of deal, right?

Your husband cheated on you,
the rotten bastard.

- And now you're cheating on him?
- No, he never cheated on me.

Oh, so what?
He's mean to you, he's abusive?

No. He's a doll.

Is he gay?

Not at all.

Was he in some sort
of bizarre hunting accident?

What?

You know, fell crotch-first
into an open bear trap?

No. He's all man.

So then why are you doing this?

Well, it's very simple.

I like having sex with strangers.

Well, good for you.

Is your husband hiding somewhere
watching us?

No. He's in Dallas on business.

Charlie, are we gonna do this or what?

- Actually, I don't think I can.
- Why not?

Well, I kind of promised my mother
I wouldn't.

- Your mother?
- She's also my friend.

So, what do you wanna do?

Tell you what.

We'll leave it to chance.

If I nail this, then, you know, ditto.

Margaret.

- Oh, God.
- Who's that?

- Who do you think?
- Another stranger?

My husband. Get out.

Right.

- Where the hell should I go?
- Out the window.

I'm not going out the window.

- He's an ex-Marine.
- I'm going out the window.

Oh, damn.

- Hi.
- Sharon?

- What's up?
- I was hoping we could talk.

Oh, sure.

May I come in?

- Okay.
- Thanks.

I'm kind of surprised to see you.

I know.
I behaved really badly the other night.

You were a little emotional.

I wasn't a little emotional.
I was borderline psychotic.

Well, since you brought it up,
I'd say you crossed that border...

...with 10 more crazy people
in your trunk.

I know. I'm so sorry.

I get like that sometimes.

It's a combination of low self-esteem,
low blood sugar...

...and mixing red wine
with my dog's painkillers.

I once took my cold medication
with a mimosa.

Spaced me out the whole day.

- So you forgive me?
- Oh, absolutely.

Oh, thank you, Alan.

Don't mention it.

What are we doing?

I'd like to make it up to you.

Do you really think that's a good idea?
Last time it didn't work out so well.

Please, Alan,
just give me another chance?

Oh, what the hell.

- I thought you were in Dallas.
- I was.

I got a phone call telling me
to check on my wife.

A phone call? From who?

That's not important.

This marriage is over.

I want you out of my house.

Well, I'm not leaving.

You're gonna have to,
because I'm selling it.

In this market? Are you crazy?

I've got a great realtor.

And she assures me
she can get top dollar.

You've already talked to a realtor?

Who do you think called me in Dallas?

And she's not just my realtor.

She's my friend.

Oh, Mom.

I hate you.

You're a pig, and you used me.

Hey, she's cute.

Yes, she is.

- So how's it going?
- Well, we're trying to make it work.

Good for you.

So how was your night?

You'd be proud of me.

- I took the high road.
- Congratulations.

Didn't matter.

It rarely does.

Wait a minute. You're telling me...

...Mom knew you were gonna sleep
with that woman...

...and called the husband
so that he'd catch her?

Yep.

The marriage ends and Mom gets
a big commission for selling their house.

She's an evil genius, Alan.

If she lived in Gotham City,
Batman would be toast.

Hey, isn't that your new girlfriend?

Where?

Over there.

Walking into the ocean
with all her clothes on.

Oh, yeah.

She gets a little suicidal
after we have sex.

Yeah, yeah...

Well, I'd better go pull her in.

Ask if she's got a friend.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

No, I think your retainer is sexy.

I do. You just gotta remember to clean it
after lunch.

Hey, Jake,
how about you and me going out...?

Okay, now I have a question for you.

If I needed a lung
and your dad needed a lung...

...who would you give your lung to?

Well, now see,
I wouldn't have to think about it.

Jake, I'm talking to you.
Don't give me the hand.

Hang on. I'm talking to a girl.

Sorry. Oh, no, that was nobody.

That's it. Time to get a new kid.

Hey, Alan,
you wanna catch a movie tonight?

Can't. I am taking a lady
to the Hollywood Bowl...

...for a romantic evening under the stars
with Michael Bublé...

...and three runners-up
from American Idol.

What's in the bag, a noose?

No, it's a picnic basket.
Fried chicken, bottle of merlot...

...and my autograph hound
in case I get lucky.

- Why don't you take Jake to the movies?
- No, I don't like him anymore.

Okay, then why don't you take
one of your many...?

Oh, let's call them girlfriends.

Yeah, I could...

...but, after the movie,
I bring them back here...

...after I get them here,
I get them upstairs.

After I get them upstairs,
I gotta get them to go home.

It just doesn't seem
worth the effort anymore.

It's possible you might enjoy your dates
if you went out with women...

...who are capable of using their head
other than a place to rest their ankles.

What are you saying?

Too subtle?

I'm saying you might have a better time
if you were seeing someone...

...who had a fully formed personality
or was even remotely age-appropriate.

- Define "age appropriate."
- Forty.

Are you out of your mind?

Come on, Charlie.
The woman I'm seeing now is 39.

We have a wonderful time
because we have so much in common.

We can talk, we can share,
we can laugh.

Talking, sharing and laughing is fine
but what about her ears?

- What about them?
- Ears never stop growing, Alan.

And I like a nice, taut lobe.

This conversation is over.

I will see you later.

Why do you think old ladies
wear big earrings?

To make their ears look smaller.

Like I'm the only one who's noticed.

I'd like to make a toast to my wife.

Darling, you've given me
the happiest 20 years of my life.

Why? Was she in a coma?

I can 't imagine living without you.
You complete me.

Bet she's got a set of ears on her.

Oh, yeah.

You could swat flies with those things.

Hey, pal.

It's just you and me tonight, huh?

Yeah, I know how you feel.

There's a lot of fish in the sea...

...but after you catch them
and eat them, then what?

Damn straight. It's not worth the hassle.

My mistake.
Didn't know you had a date.

If you two don't have plans, why don't
you fly to the Hollywood Bowl...

...and take a crap on my brother?

Really? I dreamt about you too.
What was your dream?

We were on a train in a tunnel?

Sounds kind of boring.

It means what?

Oh, hey, you're up early.

No way.

I am not just getting home.
I couldn't sleep so I went for a walk.

Dad, a little privacy, please?

Okay, I just didn't want you to get
the wrong idea.

I'm confused. If I'm in the train,
how can I be the train?

At least he's not the tunnel.

Hi.

I'm just getting in.

Yeah, I can see that.

Didn't get much sleep last night.

- And yet I feel totally rested.
- Good for you.

I mean, rested but spent.

Gotcha.

I mean, not so much spent
as happily depleted.

- Joyously bereft of...
- I get it. You got laid.

And Michael Bublé's autograph.

Congratulations.

So how was your evening?

You know, I talked to Donna about you.

- Donna?
- The woman I was with last night.

Oh, yeah, yeah. You talk, you share,
you laugh. Kiss my ass.

Anyway, turns out she has a friend
who's newly single.

- And I suggested...
- A blind date?

Forget it. Charlie Harper does not go
on blind dates.

- He doesn't?
- No, he doesn't.

Can't we ask him?

Don't bother. I know what he'll say.

Okay, but does he have to say it
in the third person?

Look, I don't need anybody to get me
dates. I can get my own dates.

But you were complaining that the
women you go out with don't fulfill you.

Donna's friend is beautiful.
She's accomplished, she's smart.

- How old is she?
- I think around 40.

Hello.

- Still with the ears?
- It's not just ears.

Women that age have a lot of baggage.

Right. And you've just got a carryon.

Think about this.
What if I meet this woman?

I like her, she likes me,
we get married and settle down?

We're both 40 now.
In 20 years, I'm gonna be 60.

And do you know how old
she's gonna be?

- Sixty?
- I rest my case.

- That was nice, huh?
- I guess.

My ear's still a little soggy.

Sorry.

So, Deedee, is that short for anything?

- Like what?
- I don't know.

No, it's just a nickname.

- What's your real name?
- Sissy.

Sissy, huh?

I guess that means
you throw a ball like a girl.

I am a girl.

Right.

- Is Charlie short for anything?
- Charles.

That's not really shorter, is it?

Excuse me.

Why? Did you fart?

No, you hang up first.

Okay, on three.

One, two, three.

You didn't hang up, did you?
Me neither.

Okay, set it up.

What?

The blind date with the old chick. I'm in.

What?

- Alan, let's go.
- Relax, we've got plenty of time.

I just don't wanna be late.

I can't believe it.
You're nervous about a date.

Of course I'm nervous.
What am I gonna talk to her about?

I haven't gone out with
a 40-year-old woman since high school.

Charlie, that's the great thing about
seeing someone your own age.

There's always something to talk about.

What you've been through,
she's been through.

Oh, I hardly think so.

All right, point taken.
But she's a fascinating woman.

She's a municipal court judge,
she teaches law at UCLA.

Oh, man, you didn't tell me that.

- Does that make a difference?
- Big difference.

The smarter the girl, the harder it is
to blow smoke up her ass.

You know, I'm already regretting this.

And for good reason.
Let's just call it off.

No, no, no, it's too late for that.

Just relax and, I don't know,
be yourself.

And by "yourself,"
I mean someone else entirely.

Anything else?

Well, as long we've opened
this particular can of worms...

...you might wanna rethink
the bowling shirt.

- Why?
- Well, as I said...

...she's a judge and a law professor.

And, let's be honest, you don't bowl.

All right, I'll go change.

- And Charlie?
- Yeah?

While you're at it, why don't we go
for the big-boy pants.

Fine.

- Oh, there they are.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

Which one's mine?

- The one on the right.
- Wow, she's 40?

She has the ears of a 20-year-old.

Come on.

You think she had them done?

Sorry we're late.
Charlie couldn't decide what to wear.

Oh, I think he looks very nice.

- Thank you.
- Charlie, this is Donna.

- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

This is my friend, Linda.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

- I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you too.

And, I gotta say,
I am pleasantly surprised.

Really? How so?

Well, Alan tells me
you're a judge and a professor...

...and, quite frankly,
I wasn't expecting someone so...

So, what, Charlie?

Yummy.

That was wrong, wasn't it?

Yes, that was wrong.

What I meant was,
I was expecting you to be...

...more, you know, dry.

But you're not.
You're actually kind of moist.

Oh, good Lord.

You know what? You know what?
I think I'd like to start over.

- Hi, I'm Charlie.
- Linda.

Hi, Linda.

I gotta tell you,
I have never met a judge before.

You know, voluntarily.

- Better?
- Anything's better than "moist."

So how do you and Donna
know each other?

Oh, well, we met in the church choir.

We found our kids
were in the same preschool.

Next thing, we're on the carnival
committee, doing the bake sale.

Which reminds me, I'm supposed to be
snack mom next Tuesday.

- Can you switch?
- No problem.

Thanks.

I got nothing.

Hey, hey. Why don't we order
some drinks?

- Just iced tea for me.
- Me too.

- Charlie, you want iced tea?
- Why on Earth would I want iced tea?

Because you don't drink alcohol
during the daytime.

Oh, right, of course not.

Iced tea, rocks, water back.

- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes, can I help...? Charlie?

Oh, hey. Hi.

- How come you never called me?
- Well...

Funny story. Long story.

Tell you later.

- Can we get four iced teas, please?
- I'll be right back.

- Old friend?
- Yeah, you know, church choir, bake sale.

You may not wanna drink the iced tea.

You know, Alan, I gotta hand it to you,
Linda is really something.

Yeah, yeah. She's terrific.

- But let me ask you something.
- Sure.

What in God's name possessed you
to talk about pornography?

- Hey, she started it.
- She wasn't talking about pornography.

She was talking about constitutional law
and the First Amendment.

- Which includes pornography.
- Yes, it does.

But it does not include
your favorite actresses, top 10 DVDs...

...or your beefs
about the bonus features.

I just pointed out that the bloopers,
though funny...

...are really more of a turnoff.

Hello? Yeah, yeah. Hi, Donna.

Charlie and I were just talking
about what a nice time we had.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Ask her if Linda likes me.

Hang on. You're kidding, right?

Come on, chicks talk to each other.

Donna, would you please tell my brother
what you just told me?

Here.

Hey, Donna. Talk to me.

I see. Okay, well,
thanks for the heads up.

Linda didn't like me.

Go figure.

I told her not to drink the iced tea.

That's what I heard.
Danny Sholander likes Jennifer Denapoli.

Hi.

Really? He's gay?

Does he know that?

You gotta get me another crack at her.

- What?
- I need to see her again.

- See who?
- Linda. I can't let it end this way.

- Let what end? It was a lunch.
- No, no, no. It was more than a lunch.

It was a test. Is Charlie Harper capable
of stepping up to quality women?

Oh, God, we're back to third person.

Alan, I am tired of having
meaningless sex with hot pinheads.

What a coincidence.
I'm tired of hearing about it.

Linda's smart, Linda's sophisticated,
Linda's successful.

- Linda doesn't like you.
- She will. I can make her.

You just need to tell Donna to tell Linda
to give me another chance.

Fine, I'll pass her a note
during study hall.

Hey, hey, hey,
don't belittle my feelings.

I'm in a very sensitive place
and I will kick your ass.

Look. Come on, Charlie. So you
struck out with a woman. It happens.

Believe me, it happens.

When it does, the best thing to do
is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off...

...and curse God for making you
the way you are.

All right, forget it. I don't need you.
I'll call her myself.

Sorry about the "curse God" stuff...

...but we both know
I'm not your best work.

Yeah, hi, can I speak
to Judge Linda Harris please?

Charlie Harper.

Yes, again.

All right, fine,
put me through to voice mail.

Banging a judge won't get you out
of jury duty. Believe me, I've tried.

No, no, no. Quiet.

Yeah, hi, Linda. It's Charlie again.

I just want you to know
that this will be my last message.

I figure three's a charm,
four is a restraining order.

Look who I'm telling.

Anyway, I know we didn't get off
on the right foot.

I'm not used to spending time with
such a remarkable, accomplished woman.

Keep shoveling.

And it's true. I've lived
a certain kind of life up until now.

I'm not saying that I'm proud of it,
but I'm not ashamed of it either.

Why else would you have videotaped
most of it?

I'm begging you.

So if you wanna call me back,
call me back.

If not, well, have a nice life.

But it would be a nicer life
if you called me.

Wow, I never thought
I'd see Charlie Harper on his knees.

You know, figuratively.

Can we please talk about me
in the first person?

What's this broad got that's so special?

- A brain.
- What are you gonna do with a brain?

It doesn't matter. She'll never call me.

Oh, don't talk like that.

Because she's smart and successful
doesn't mean...

...she's not damaged enough
to go out with you.

Thanks, Berta. That means a lot.

Hello?

No, Jake's not here.
Try him at his mom's house.

- Where you going?
- I don't know.

Someplace where the bottles are full
and the women are empty.

And skies are not cloudy all day

Fifty-dollar fine, time served.
Call the next case.

Case number 1217-07.

Charles Harper, charged with drunk
and disorderly, resisting arrest.

Charlie?

Oh, hey.

Small world, huh?

Approach the bench, please.

Excuse me. I think this is personal.

Please tell me you did not get yourself
arrested just so you could see me.

You got me.

Charlie, what am I going to do with you?

Have dinner with me. Otherwise,
we're looking at a crime spree here.

All right, one dinner.

- Now step back.
- Yes, ma'am.

- How do you plead?
- Guilty, Your Honor.

- Is this a first offense?
- Yes.

- All right, $500 fine.
- Five hundred dollars? Last time...

- Last time?
- Thank you, Your Honor.

- Next case.
- Case number 1217-08.

- Heidi Jones, charged with solicitation.
- Hey, Charlie.

- Thanks for picking me up, Alan.
- Where's your car?

- Good question.
- Oh, Charlie...

Yeah, we just got my uncle out of jail.
It was cool. I saw a real pimp.

- Well, I hope you learned a lesson here.
- I sure did.

- What was that lesson?
- If a woman won't return your calls...

...get drunk, get arrested,
then lie through your teeth.

That's it? That's what you learned?

Well, also, if your cellmate wants your
bologna sandwich, just give it to him.

Okay, I'll be your pimp
if you'll be my beyotch.

- Jake, that's enough with the phone.
- Nobody. What were you saying?

Hey.

I'd have kept the phone
and tossed the kid.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

- Thank you for a lovely dinner.
- You're welcome.

- Good night.
- Wait, wait, wait.

Are you sure
you don't want me to tuck you in?

I don't need to be tucked, Charlie.

Oh, come on, everybody needs
a good tucking once in a while.

Well, then, go tuck yourself.

I guess I'll have to.

I'm not saying no.
I'm just saying not now.

I understand.

- Good night.
- Good night.

How about now?

Funny.

I wasn't going for a laugh.

Come on, Luther.

Rose?

No, it couldn't be.

I'm so backed up I'm literally cockeyed.

Hot girl at 12 o'clock.

- Where?
- Over there.

That would be 9 o'clock.

No, it's 12. Actually, 12:05.

Twelve-ish.

- Wanna straighten him out or should I?
- Go ahead, take a swing.

Okay. The reason guys say
hot girl at like 12 o'clock or 3 o'clock...

...is to specify a location
using the clock face as kind of a map.

What if you have a digital watch?

First of all, you're not gonna meet
any women if you wear a digital watch.

Second of all, it doesn't matter.
The clock face is imaginary.

How do you know
what time you saw the girl?

Oh, my God.

You know what? I'm wrong.
There's a hot girl and it's 12:06.

Check.

Hey, he likes girls and he can tell time.
I'm a happy dad.

- Hello, Your Honor, what's up?
- Your Honor?

Oh, your uncle's dating a judge.

This weekend? Sure, that sounds great.

- You mean like an American Idol judge?
- No, a real judge.

American Idol judges are real, Dad.

So, what,
we'd be staying in adjoining rooms?

- No, no, no, one room is fine.
- Why is he dating a judge?

- Is he trying to get out of something?
- No.

More like he's trying
to get into something.

Good one.

- You understood that?
- Not really.

That's how I knew it was good.

Oh, yeah, that's a very romantic hotel.
I've stayed there...

Never in my life.
Right. Okay, talk to you later.

Santa Barbara, this weekend, one room.

Oh, now I get it.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

- Son of a gun, Alan, look.
- What?

- The blond.
- Where?

Twelve-oh-eight.

She looks like Rose.

It couldn't be.
She's still in England, right?

- Last I heard.
- I got a postcard from her the other day.

- Really? What did it say?
- Well, let's see.

"Dear Jake, how are you? I am fine.
Hope you're doing well in school."

I think that's a joke because she knows
I struggle with my grades.

Let's see, what else? Oh, yeah.
"Say hello from England to everybody."

Hello from England.

Well, there you go. She's in England.

I guess.
So why do I keep thinking I see her?

- Maybe you miss her.
- I don't think so.

I was a little down when she left,
which is to be expected...

...but I've got Linda now
and I've moved on...

...and why am I talking to you
about my life?

Because I'm a good listener?

Because you have no other friends?

- We're dropping him off at his mother's?
- Yep.

Dear Charlie,
greetings from faggy old London.

Greetings from foggy old London.

Hope you are doing well
and not working too hard.

Things are going great for me.

I love my job and my flat
and my new friends.

Sometimes, my life in Malibu
feels like a crazy dream.

I hope you can forgive me
for all my bizarre behavior...

... and know that I will always
remember you fondly.

Your friend, Rose.

P.S., Give my best to Alan.

I'm sure by now
he's found a place of his own.

- What you got there?
- It's a letter from Rose.

Really? That come today?

No, a few months ago.
I just never got around to reading it.

I noticed you didn't toss it out.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Charlie.

Of all the broads who've staggered...

...bare-assed
through these hallowed halls...

...she's the one who really got to you.

Yeah, she got to me.

She put a sleeping pill in my Scotch
and superglued my testicles to my leg.

You just can't get past that, can you?

Well, it doesn't matter.

I'm in a real relationship now
with an incredible woman.

A judge, a constitutional scholar.

A woman who may one day
be a state senator.

But does she care enough
to line her mittens...

...with hair she collects
from your shower drain?

I don't know yet. We're going slow.

- Really?
- Yes.

Getting to know each other as people
before we jump into bed...

...and get to know each other
as, you know, animals.

Just do me a favor
and make the first time at her place...

...because you're gonna spring forth
like a Water Wiggle.

Charlie?

- Charlie?
- What?

I need your help.

If you're doing laundry,
all I can say is you're doing it wrong.

No, no, the lady I've been seeing,
you know, Linda's friend Donna?

She wants to... How shall we say?

Take it up a notch.

- Yeah, so?
- I'm out of notches.

- What do you need?
- A younger man's penis.

My night stand, top drawer,
next to the Ping-Pong paddle.

Take one with water
and stall for 20 minutes.

Thanks.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

- Don't those hurt?
- Hell, yeah.

- Why don't you take them off?
- There's a penalty involved.

Long story.

I can tell you how it ends.

- Lovely dinner.
- Yeah. Food was great.

- It's a beautiful room.
- Yeah. Room's great.

Nice view.

Yep, view's great.

Oh, for God's sake.

- Who is it?
- Room service, señor.

We didn't order anything.

It's champagne.
Compliments of the hotel.

- Can you slip it under the door?
- Charlie.

Don't move. Don't change your mind.

- Do you want I open?
- No, thank you.

Okay, good night.

Charlie.

- Yeah?
- I'm waiting.

For what?

Oh, right.

Hang on.

What are you doing to the rose?

I just don't want it looking at me.

- Anything interesting going on in school?
- I started algebra.

Oh, how's that going?

I don't get it at all,
but the teacher's really hot.

- Well, that's nice.
- Yeah, she's got some really great racks.

I think you mean rack.

No, she's got two,
and they're ginormous.

It's kind of cool
that she's teaching algebra.

Nothing?

Boy, that killed in detention.

- Oh, hey, how was Santa Barbara?
- Santa Bar-bra?

It's Spanish for "City of Great Racks."

Alan,
I got no patience for your kid today.

Go do your homework.

Oh, right. I have
a big reading ass-ignment.

You're not my audience.

- Remember when he was cute?
- The memory is fading.

So how was your big night with Linda?

- Fine.
- Just fine?

Yes. Just fine.

Oh, I see.

No, you don't.

All right.

- Wanna talk about it?
- Oh, golly, Alan, more than anything.

Okay, never mind. Stew in it.

Thank you.

I finally got to step up to the plate
and I was swinging a garden hose.

You happy?

Well, I'm not sad.

What do you think the problem was?

I saw her again.

- Saw who?
- Rose.

She brought champagne
to our hotel room...

...except this time, she was Hispanic.

What was she last time?

Last time, she was a blond with coffee...

...and before that,
she was a redhead with a dog.

- What kind of dog?
- What difference does it make?

I like dogs.

Go on.

If I didn't know any better,
I'd say she was stalking me again.

- From England?
- We don't know she's in England.

She sends letters and postcards.
Jake gets them all the time.

Like she couldn't leave a stack of them
with some friend to mail every few days.

Oh, wow, are you listening to yourself?
Even Rose isn't that crazy.

Oh, and she's gonna fly back and forth
with a dog?

She could hire a local dog.

Charlie, Rose is in England.
She's not stalking you.

And whatever you think you're seeing
is in your head.

Yeah, you're probably right.

Regardless,
last night was less than a triumph.

Why didn't you just take
one of your pills?

Because somebody else
took my last three.

Oh, yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

That's four.

The first one was a twofer.

- What kind of dog?
- I don't know, it was a dog.

Four legs and a tail.
Can we please get back to my problem?

Not a dog person.

So you believe
you're seeing people who aren't there?

No, no, no.

They're there,
but they're not who they are.

Well, then, who are they?

I don't know who they are,
but they all look like Rose.

- Your stalker.
- Well, that's kind of harsh.

You told me she broke into your home...

...disrobed and handcuffed herself
to your refrigerator.

Just the one time.

So why do I keep seeing her
everywhere I go?

Well, Charlie, if I tell you that now,
what'll we do for the rest of the hour?

I'm joshing.

Why don't we talk
about your current relationship?

Linda? Well, let's see.
She's a municipal-court judge.

- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

I meant for her, Charlie.

It's hardly your accomplishment now,
is it?

Well, yeah, in a way.
I've never done a judge before.

Well, from what you told me,
you still haven't.

Touché.

Pays to listen.

- So how old is Linda?
- She's about my age.

First time you've been
with a woman that old?

Oh, no, not at all.

So you've had age-appropriate
relationships before?

Relationships? No, no, are you crazy?

Am I crazy? Pot, kettle, Charlie.

Okay, look, I didn't come to therapy
to talk this to death.

I've seen Rose three times
and it's ruining my sex life with Linda.

Can you help me or do I have to learn
to shoot pool with a rope?

Well, thank you
for that disturbing image.

Best I can tell,
for the first time in your life...

...you are involved
in an adult relationship.

It's challenging,
maybe even a little intimidating.

And the fact that you're fantasizing
about a woman in England...

...who idolized you
beyond all rational measure...

...well, that tells me
that you're afraid to grow up.

And we call that
the Peter Pan syndrome.

That's pretty good.

So, what can we do,
you know, Peter-wise?

If you're committed to personal growth,
you'll walk through your fear...

...and embrace the challenges
of a really meaningful relationship...

...with an adult woman.

And your only other choice
is to live the emotionally stunted life...

...you've been living over and over.

Never growing, never changing.

Good afternoon, and welcome aboard
British Airways Flight 471...

... nonstop
to London 's Heathrow Airport.

Charlie.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

I'm not sure. I just needed to see you.

I need to talk to you. I can
come back if now is not a good time.

No, no, it's okay.

I know you've probably moved on.
I thought I had too...

...but everywhere I look,
I keep seeing your face...

...so I started thinking, maybe...

I don't know what I'm thinking.
Are you busy?

Can I take you out
for a cold beer or something?

Actually, on this side of the pond,
we drink our beer warm.

You can still catch a buzz, right?

- Oh, yeah.
- Then warm's fine.

Okay.

- Well, I'll just get my purse.
- Great.

So I'm not screwing up
any plans of yours?

Oh, no. This fits perfectly into my plans.

- Oh, Linda, hi.
- Hi, Alan.

I'm sorry to show up unannounced, but
Charlie hasn't been answering his phone.

And I wanted to make sure he's okay.

Oh, Charlie's fine.
We have a pharmacy that delivers.

What?

- Nothing, nothing. Come on in.
- Thanks.

He should be getting up
sometime soon, anyway.

So how are things with you and Donna?

Good, good.

I'll go get Charlie.

Hey, Dad, girls' volleyball.
Lot of bouncing boobs.

- Not now, Jake.
- You told me to tell you.

- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

Shut up.

Oh, hey.

- Hello. You must be Jake.
- Yeah, who are you?

Linda.
I'm a friend of your Uncle Charlie's.

Are you the judge?

- Do you play volleyball?
- No. Do you?

No, I just like to watch them
jump up and down.

Okay. Heigh-ho, go away.

I thought Charlie was asleep,
but he's not in his room.

Berta, have you seen Charlie?

- He's not in his bed?
- No.

- Passed out on the bathroom floor?
- No.

- Rubbing oil on the volleyball girls?
- No.

Well, that just leaves the bars,
hospitals and jails.

I'll go get the yellow pages.

Well, he couldn't have gone very far.

Hey, Dad. Hot girl in a thong.

What time is it?

Tepid.

So London certainly agrees
with you, Rose.

- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, Charlie.

I just can't believe you're here.

Yeah, well, I wanted you to know I've
been thinking a lot about you lately...

...and I miss you.

Oh, Charlie, I miss you too.

Are you seeing anybody?

Actually, I am seeing someone, but
I'm not really sure where it's going yet.

- You?
- To be honest...

...there is one lady I've been dating.

She's actually my own age.

- No.
- Yeah.

But my therapist says
she's not good for me.

And you think I am?

Well, you've always loved me for
who I am instead of who I could be...

...which is really wonderful,
because, let's face it...

...we both love who I am.

I do love you, Charlie.

Great.

So?

So what?

So, what's next?

What do you mean?

Well, you can't expect me to go back
to what we had without a commitment.

- A commitment?
- Yes.

I think we should get married.

Married?

Sell the house in Malibu...

...and move to a kid-friendly
neighborhood here in London.

Kid?

Kids.

We're gonna have kids, aren't we?

Good afternoon and welcome aboard
British Airways Flight 472...

... nonstop
to Los Angeles International Airport.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing home?

Linda's spending time
with her son tonight.

Apparently she's one of those
single moms that puts her kid first.

The bitch.

You're just saying that
because our mom put us third.

Fourth after she got the Datsun 280Z.

So, what you doing?

Paying our household bills.

You're a good wife, Alan.

I can't believe some lucky fella
hasn't snapped you up.

Probably the penis.

That's usually a deal breaker.

So how are we doing, bill-wise?

Not very well.

Are you aware you haven't had
a paying job in over nine months?

Are you aware
that urine cures athlete's foot?

Seriously, you've got a big pile of bills
and no money coming in.

Seriously, no burning,
no itching, just clears it right up.

The drug companies don't want you
to know about it because it's free.

Charlie, you're unemployed.

I know. Haven't you heard?
The jingle business is dead.

How would I hear that?
Who would have told me?

It was in all the jingle magazines.

You know,
before they went out of business.

Everybody's using old rock songs now.

They're not gonna hire me
to write a jingle for tampons...

...when they can just play
"Stuck in the Middle With You."

But...

This doesn't concern you at all?

- No, something will turn up.
- How can you be so sure?

Hey, do you have any idea
how I got in the jingle business?

- No.
- Neither do I.

But look how good that worked out.

Charlie, you cannot depend
on the kindness of the universe.

I have to.

I don't have an older brother
I can sponge off of.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go pee on my feet.

Okay.

Oh, crap.

- Berta, you got a minute?
- What's on your mind, princess?

Well, first and foremost...

...you know that we consider you
a beloved member of this family.

Alan, you can roll manure in powdered
sugar, but it still ain't a jelly doughnut.

Now see, right there...

...that's one of the things
that we love about you, you know.

- Folksy...
- Spill it, Mildred.

Right, right, well,
I'm not sure you're aware of this...

...but it has been quite some time
since Charlie has had any actual income.

Okay.

And I can't help but notice...

...that you're the only beloved
family member actually drawing a salary.

I'm also the only
beloved family member...

...who takes a toothbrush
to your kid's skivvies.

And we can never begin
to repay you for that.

But during these difficult financial times,
we all have...

For the record,
it's not my toothbrush, right?

Not right now,
but cut my pay and all bets are off.

Oh, come on, Berta, be reasonable.

This might be more than just
a temporary dry spell for Charlie.

Look, I know
things may seem dark right now...

...but I've known Charlie
a lot longer than you have.

- Technically, that's not true.
- Are you gonna let me talk?

Sorry.

One thing I've learned
working for Mr. Charles Roscoe Harper...

- His middle name isn't Roscoe.
- Who's telling the story?

Continue.

Anyway, what I've learned
is God takes care of drunks and fools.

And C. Roscoe Harper is both.

His middle name is Francis.

Hi, what's going on?

Trying to save you a little money here.

Good man, appreciate it.

Check out what I bought Linda.

Diamond earrings?

She's a classy woman, Alan.

She's not gonna be impressed
with a continental breakfast...

...and a copy of the video.

Be that as it may, you can't keep
spending money you don't have.

Oh, relax. Something will turn up.

Will you stop saying that?
Things don't just turn up.

You're living in a dream world.
Money doesn't just fall from the sky.

Obviously you've never been
sitting ringside...

...when a pole dancer
hangs upside down.

So did you buy this for your girlfriend
because you're breaking up with her?

No, why would you think that?

Because you always give jewelry to girls
you're getting ready to dump.

Very observant.

You watch, you learn.

Well, this isn't breakup jewelry,
this is "I like you, stick around" jewelry.

- What's the difference?
- About 1500 bucks.

But let's back up a step.

A gentleman never dumps a lady.

He merely acknowledges the fact
that a relationship has run its course...

...by presenting her with a memento...

...a keepsake if you will,
of their time together.

Remember that big blond
who threw the toaster oven at you?

Yeah, I remember.

Oh, and that yoga teacher...

...who chucked the fire extinguisher
through your windshield.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- There was that actress who set fire...
- It's not a perfect system, Jake.

Oh, Charlie, they're beautiful.

You do realize I was going to sleep
with you tonight anyway.

This is just a little bonus.

Like when you get to a baseball game
and find out it's helmet night.

You silver-tongued devil.

Well, I don't know about silver,
but you'll find I am tongued.

If you ignore that,
there's a matching necklace in it for you.

Why don't you open the wine?

Gary, what are you doing here?

I'm sorry, I tried to call
but your line's been busy.

My line's been busy?
I haven't been on the phone.

Well, I must have called 20 times.

Fine. What do you want?

I have to work tonight
and I can't take Brandon.

- But I have company.
- And I have an emergency board meeting.

- Who are you?
- I'm Charlie.

I'm Brandon.

Nice to meet you, Brandon.

You know,
I have a nephew about your age.

Hey, Dad, did you get Mom a present
when you got divorced?

A present?

Yeah, a memento of your time together.

Jake, buddy, you're the memento
of our time together.

So you were too cheap
to get her earrings.

She did better than earrings.

She got my family jewels.

- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

When you die,
do I get Dad's family jewels?

- What?
- Nothing, just go inside.

- Okay, well, thanks for dropping him off.
- Judith, hang on a second.

What?

- How's it going?
- Good.

So your new marriage going well?
Herb's okay?

What do you want, Alan?

Charlie's business is dead,
I'm gonna be homeless.

Well, you can't stay here.

Oh, no, no,
that's not what I was getting at...

...but it's good to know
that door is firmly closed.

No, what I was hoping was that
we could talk about the child support.

What about my child support?

Well, technically, it's Jake's
child support, hence the term "child."

But I just thought maybe
we could make some trims.

For instance, the karate classes,
the archery lessons...

...the algebra tutor.

I mean, I don't know about you,
but I've never seen him...

...you know, break a board
or string a bow.

And the algebra tutor,
I mean, who are we kidding?

That's like putting swim fins on a cat.

He needs the tutor, he likes the lessons
and I'm not gonna ask Herb to pay.

- That's okay, I'll ask him. Is he home?
- Goodbye, Alan.

How about I stay in Jake's tree house?
He never uses it.

Kid doesn't even like to climb stairs.

Come on, sweetheart, just one little bite.

Nope.

He's usually not this cranky.

Have you tried a little whiskey
in his sippy cup?

- Charlie.
- I'm just saying, it worked for my brother.

- You really did that?
- Still do it.

You know what,
I'm just gonna make him a hot dog.

- You want a hot dog?
- Sure.

- I was talking to my son.
- What, you just got the one?

I'll be right back.

Come on, kid, just have a little corn
and then bedtime.

- For both of us.
- No.

Oh, for the love of God.

I don't come to Gymboree
and knock the blocks out of your hand.

Come on.

It's corntastic.

I like corn
It tastes real sweet

I don 't like peas
They taste like feet

Corn 's the king
Of the veggie-food group

And it looks the same
When it's in your poop

Son of a bitch.

I mean, golly.

Yeah.

Hi, Mom.

Hello, Alan.

Got a minute?

Sure.

I mean, could you come to the door?

No.

Please, Mom, it's important.
I'm having a real crisis here.

Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

Well, good luck with that.

Mom, please.

I'm such a pushover.

The money isn't just for me.
It's for Charlie and your only grandson.

I'll just be a minute, Teddy.

What can I do for you, Alan?

Nothing. Never mind.

What? I'm not entitled to a love life?

I'm ready for my punishment,
headmaster.

So you must be getting tired, huh?

No shame in calling it a night.

I gotta go pee-pee.

All right, go ahead.

First pee-pee then beddy-bye.
Beats the other way around, trust me.

I gotta go pee-pee now.

Linda, he says he's gotta go pee-pee.

- Would you mind taking him?
- Me?

He can't undo his pants
and I'm doing the dishes.

Fine, let's go pee-pee.

Don't feel bad.

I can't always undo my pants either.

- What are you waiting for?
- I don't have to anymore.

Linda, he says
he doesn't have to anymore.

Trust me, he has to.

- You heard the lady, let her rip.
- No.

Okay, okay, how about this?

You're a giant, and there's a tiny village
in the toilet bowl that's on fire...

...and you have to put it out
by whizzing all over it.

Hey, look.

Here comes the giant now.

I had a root beer
I had a Coke

I need to pee
Hey, I smell smoke

Giant, giant
Up in the sky

Grab your fire hose
Let it fly

Close your windows
Lock your doors

Because when I rain
It really pours

There you go.

Hey, hey, hey, I'm the only one
who gets to pee on my feet.

Come on, buddy, right in here.

Hey, Berta, look what I got.

Big deal. It's a freaking miracle
you don't have 10 of them.

This is Linda's son, Brandon.

I'm Brandon.

I got ears.

So, what's he doing here?

- I'm babysitting.
- You?

- Why not me?
- You're a rum-soaked degenerate.

Yeah, but it turns out I have child skills.

I already got him to eat his vegetables
and make pee-pee in the toilet.

So, "Do as I say, not as I do," huh?

Are you gonna help me or what?

Hey, his mom's not throwing me any.

Don't get the wrong idea.

Your mom and I are actually
in a committed relationship.

So if I sign up for this drug trial...

...I take these pills not knowing...

...if I'm getting the anxiety medication
or a placebo?

That's correct.

The test group
gets the actual medication...

...and the control group
is being given sugar pills.

So is there anything
I should know about?

Any side effects or anything?

Well, that's one of the purposes
of the research.

But in tests of this nature,
common side effects include:

"Dry mouth, hair loss,
blurred vision, inflamed gums."

- Okay.
- " Mild nausea.

Heart palpitations, liver damage.

Boils, shingles, sudden fainting...

...and temporary darkening of the stool."

Good Lord.

How much do you pay people to do this?

- A thousand dollars a week.
- I'm in.

Hey, hey, hey.

That's not a toy.

That's how I make my living. Not
so much anymore, but still, be careful.

I wanna play.

All right.

Play this one.

And this one.

That's great.

Now it's my turn.

This is a little tune I wrote for my nephew
when he was feeling down in the dumps.

I know that the winter
Follows the fall

And in New York
The buildings are tall

I hear that in China
They have a Great Wall

I know these things and more

But there's just one answer
I'm still looking for

Who cut the cheese?
Who cut the cheese?

I ask you, please
Did you cut the cheese?

I'm not averse to learnin '
Tell me why my eyes are burnin '

Who cut the cheese?

Everybody.

Who cut the cheese?
Who cut the cheese?

I ask you, please
Did you cut the cheese?

I'm not averse to learnin '
Tell me why my eyes are burnin '

Who cut the cheese?

I can't thank you enough.

No problem, we had fun.

Look, after I drop him off at his dad's,
why don't I come back...

...and show my appreciation
for those earrings?

Gee, I'd love to, but it's been a long day.

I just wanna soak in a hot bath
and have a little me time.

Oh, come on, Charlie.

Hey, hey, hey,
while you were off having fun at work...

...I was cooped up all day in this house
taking care of your child.

Okay, sorry.

I'm just saying I'm not a light switch.

I'll call you later.

Oh, wait, wait.
I made something for Brandon.

I sang some songs for him,
he seemed to like them...

...so I burned them onto a CD.

Oh, how sweet.

Sweet?
Clearly you're not familiar with my work.

Anyway, he seemed to dig them.

Well, thank you.

Hi, Alan.

Hi.

I don't think I'm in the control group.

Are you really sure you should be
taking those pills with beer?

What else can happen to me, Charlie?

My hair is coming out,
I'm having fainting spells...

...I can see my heart beating
through my shirt...

...and my poop looks like
charcoal briquettes.

So stop taking the medication.

It's $ 1000 a week.
We need the money.

Oh, relax. Something will turn up.

Something's already turned up.

I'm pretty sure I dropped a third testicle.

Hello?

Hang on.

It's Linda's ex-husband.
He wants to talk to you.

- I don't wanna talk to him, talk to him.
- I'm not gonna.

Come on. You've got 30 percent
more balls than I do.

Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie.

What about Brandon?

Oh, good, good,
I'm glad he likes the songs.

Yeah, Linda mentioned
you were in the music business.

Well, that's flattering, but I already have
a very lucrative career writing jingles.

I don't see myself walking away
from that to record children's songs.

How much?

I'm in.

How about that? Something turned up.

Send the papers over.

Great, great.

No, no, I love kids.
And more important, they love me.

No, no, no. None of my own.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Wanna hear a great band?

- Sure.
- They're called Bucket of Hate.

What do you think?

Nice beat.

Oh, my goodness.

Quite a mouth on this fella.

I guess that's why they're not called
Bucket of Bunnies, huh?

- Who's he listening to?
- Bucket of Hate.

They're good.
Reminds me of early Who.

- Who? What?
- Yeah.

- The band's called Who.
- Bucket of Hate.

And I work for your family.

Boy, I never knew there were
so many rhymes for suicide.

Yeah, what's patricide?

It means to honor thy father.

Oh, well, then that song
doesn't make sense.

Yeah, well, I'm still trying to figure out
what a su-su-sudio is.

So BOH is playing
at the Santa Monica Civic Center...

...next weekend.

Cool.

My friend Seth Friedman got tickets.
Can I go?

- How are you gonna get there?
- Car.

Thank you.

- Whose car?
- Seth's brother.

He's 17, and he's never been
in an accident that was his fault.

I don't think so.

Why not?

Why don't I think it's appropriate for a
13-year-old to go with no supervision?

I told you. Rocco is 17.

- His name is Rocco?
- Yeah.

So Rocco Friedman?

Yeah. Do you know him?

No, but I'm not letting someone
named Rocco Friedman drive you...

...to a Bucket of Hate concert.

That's it. Just no?

Oh, I'm sorry.

No way in hell.

Oh, man.

- What's going on?
- My dad sucks.

You know, in certain primitive cultures,
when a boy hits puberty...

...they tie him to a big rock,
and throw him in the ocean.

- No, they don't.
- Okay.

But you can't argue with the logic.

No, I can't.

Here. Your girlfriend's in the paper.

Really? What for?

She's being honored by the Southern
California Trial Lawyers Association.

"Judge of the Year."

Yeah, I guess it's time to get out
the old tux for the banquet, huh?

What banquet?

The one at the Beverly Hilton
next Saturday.

Oh, right.

Yeah, I don't think I'm going to that.

Why not?

You know,
I hate the whole dog and pony show.

Getting dressed up,
speeches, rubber chicken...

- She didn't invite you, did she?
- Didn't even mention it.

That's gotta sting.

You know, I agree with Jake.

You do suck.

God, Charlie, you are great.

No.

I'm serious.

You are the best lover I have ever had.

It's probably just the flawless
technique and the big penis.

Probably.

I was wondering.

- You got any plans next Saturday?
- Next Saturday?

Oh, as a matter of fact, I do.

What might they be?

The plans?

Just some business thing. Very boring.

- Business.
- Yeah, business.

Might this be
the business we're speaking of?

"Dilbert"?

This?

Oh, that.

Oh, I can explain.

I would love an explanation.

Well, I just thought
it wouldn't be your kind of thing.

You know, it's just judges,
lawyers, local politicians.

- Are you going with somebody else?
- No.

So you'd rather go alone than take me?

I know it seems that way.

- You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
- Oh, no, Charlie.

Sure, you can use me for sex, but
God forbid we're out in public together.

That is not true.

And let me remind you.

It's the best sex you've ever had.

- Charlie...
- Your words, not mine.

Look, the last thing in the world
I wanna do is hurt your feelings.

Well, you have.

Would you like to go with me
to the banquet?

No. I don't wanna go
where I'm not wanted.

- What do you want me to do? Beg?
- A little, yeah.

Please come with me to the banquet.

A little more.

Pretty please?

Come with me.

All right.

But then we gotta talk
about this banquet thing.

Jake, do you want Grandmommy
to teach you how to use chopsticks?

Don't confuse him.
He just learned how to use a fork.

Real funny, Alan.

Alan? What happened to Dad?

He turned into Benito Mussoroni.

The San Francisco treat?

It's Mussolini, professor.

He's upset, I won't let him
go to a concert.

- Why not?
- Because there's no adult supervision.

Oh, don't be such a fuddy-duddy, Alan.

He's a teenager. Teenagers don't go
to concerts with their parents.

I'm with Evelyn on this.

Forget it.
You are not going to the concert.

Oh, listen to you.

Remember I said you couldn't go
to that Peter Frampton concert?

You snuck out of the house
and went anyway.

- Really?
- Mom, no.

I was in Martinique at the time,
but the housekeeper was beside herself.

And I was severely punished
for that, right?

Oh, sure, I tried grounding you,
and taking away TV privileges.

But at a certain point, every parent
has to accept that they're powerless...

...when it comes
to controlling a teenager.

- Really?
- No.

No, not really.

Parents are powerful, very powerful.

No, no:

No, trust me.
I'm only doing this for your own good.

What the hell was that?

The same thing Grandma did.

No, it's not. You sound
like you're coughing up a fur ball.

Yeah, well, I'm making the same point.

Did it even occur to you
that you could help me?

I was not put on this Earth
to help you, Alan.

You're my mother.

Yes, and as you never tire
of pointing out, not a good one.

Hey, Alan, do we have
any snack bars?

Right-hand cabinet. Why?

Oh, I need something
to soak up the booze...

...I'll have to drink
to make it through this dinner.

What's the occasion?

My girlfriend is being honored
at a banquet.

Oh, I thought the Adult Film Awards
were in Vegas.

She happens to be a judge.

Of the Adult Film Awards?

No. No.

A judge
in the Los Angeles Municipal Court.

So do I look okay?

It's a tuxedo. You can't go wrong.

I wanna fit in.
This is a very conservative crowd.

Well, then you can go wrong.

Thanks. Like I'm not nervous?

Oh, sweetheart, if you're nervous,
just try one of these. It'll relax you.

Oh, perfect.

Charlie, you just can't pop a pill
without knowing what it is.

She just said what it is.
Thanks, Mom, gotta go.

Bye, sweetheart. Have a
good time with your judge, darling.

That will last.

I don't know.
I think he's really trying on this one.

What?

Nothing.

Guess I'll just have to watch my DVD
of Fantasia on the natch tonight.

Congratulations, Your Honor.

- Well deserved.
- Oh, thank you, councilman.

I'd like you to meet my friend
Charlie Harper.

Charlie, this is Councilman Stewart.

- Charlie?
- Yeah, hi. How are you?

Again, congratulations.

Thanks.

Charlie, are you okay?

I'm wonderful.

Look at all the colors.

It's like I'm drinking a rainbow.

Hang on. He's probably in his room.

Jake, your mom's on the phone.

Jake?

Jake?

Son of a bitch.

- Alan, what's going on? Are you all right?
- What?

Oh, I stubbed my toe.

Yeah, yeah. It may be broken.

Yeah, I'm gonna go
to the emergency room.

Oh, no, no, I have to take
Jake with me...

...so we can go in the carpool lane.

Jake, help Daddy find his toenail.

I'll have him call you later, okay?

Son of a bitch.

So without further ado,
here's our guest of honor...

...Judge of the Year,
and I'm proud to say my good friend...

...Judge Linda Harris.
- Yeah.

Yeah.

Who the judge? You the judge.

I'm hitting that.

Los Angeles, thank you.

Hey, look who's here.

Keep it down.

Right, we don't wanna wake me.

What are you doing sitting out here?

I can't stand up.

Don't make a thing out of it.

What are you doing?

I snuck out to see a concert.

No way.

That is so cool.

Okay.

Third time's the charm.

Hey, wanna know what else is cool?

Check this out.

Hey, hey, I'm caroling here.

You should be bringing me Cocoa
and Gingerbread.

Cocoa and gingerbread?

Yeah.

They work at the Spearmint Rhino.

But I digress.

- Where were we?
- My dad doesn't know I went out.

So now I have to sneak back in.

Well, then you certainly
don't wanna go through this door.

- Why not?
- Why not?

I'll tell you why not.

- What?
- Why not?

Why not what?

Why can't I go through that door?

Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

If I know your dad, and sadly I do...

...he's sitting in there right now,
just waiting to tie you to a rock...

...and throw you in the ocean.

What?

Sorry.
I may have put the idea in his head.

Follow me.

- Where are we going?
- Hey, I'll ask the questions.

Where are we going?

All right.

I'm okay.

Here, grab my... What do you call it?

- Hand.

I'm okay.

That's great.
But you're sitting on my head.

Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

I do not.

Do you have any idea
how beautiful you look in that light?

- I'm not talking to you.
- Well, I'm not talking to you either.

Except for right now.

This is me talking to you,
but no longer.

Would you please just go to sleep?

Okey-dokey.

- You and I have some talking to do.
- Will you make up your freaking mind?

Morning.

What? You're not talking to me?

I looked up patricide.

Really?

When did you learn to spell?

I sounded it out.

Patricide, huh?

Our little boy is growing up.

He's just upset because he snuck out.

So I grounded him for three months.

- That ought to show him.
- What am I gonna do, Berta?

- I can't hit him.
- Well, sure you can.

You just gotta figure the wind,
and lead him.

They're like pheasants.

Very funny.

What?

Charlie's gonna wanna see this.

No, he's not.

Charlie, wake up.

You need to see this.

Can I throw up in it?

- No.
- Then I don't need to see it.

Charlie, do you remember
what you did last night?

Oh, damn it.

Did I get married?

Hardly.

Oh, you just know she's gonna
find a way to make this my fault.

You climbed out the window?

And got into a car
driven by a 17-year-old boy.

It wasn't a car, Dad.
It was an extremely safe monster truck.

I mean, even if Rocco hit another car,
he'd just crush it.

The point is,
you disobeyed your father.

That doesn't mean
I have to get grounded.

In my opinion,
your punishment isn't severe enough.

- Your mother's right.
- How come nobody asks my opinion?

Go to your room.
I will talk to you later.

Fine.

Hey, thanks for backing me up here,
Judith.

Now that he's a teenager,
we need to stick together to...

You don't have a brain in your head,
do you?

You have to watch teenagers, Alan.

You can't just expect
they'll listen and obey.

God, you're useless.

Here. Let me give you a hand.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Now, come with me.

- Where are we going?
- You're going back to your room.

But I am going
to the sweet land of vindication.

Oh, Judith.

Yes?

Hey.

What are you doing here?

I came to apologize.

I am sorry about last night.

You're sorry for ruining one of the most
important nights of my career?

For embarrassing me
within an inch of my life?

Well, yeah.

I mean, unless I did something else.

No, you did quite enough. Thank you.

Look, I understand why you're mad.

But it really wasn't my fault.

I was nervous about last night,
so my mother gave me...

...what I assumed
was one of her tranquilizers.

Now I'm thinking it was
a little something...

...she had left over
from Woodstock.

Charlie, look,
you're a lot of fun and I like you.

But people are talking about me
running for state senate next year.

And I can't afford to be linked publicly
to someone like you.

Well, that's not a problem.

We'll just sneak around
and link privately.

No, Charlie.

Come on, all the guy politicians
have something on the side.

Why shouldn't you?

Take care.

It would send a powerful message
to young women everywhere.

- Bailiff.
- I'm going.

Pretty flowers.

Thanks.

Wanna stick them in something?

Never mind.

I thought I was up to it, Alan.

I thought I was ready
for a real relationship.

That Linda and I would be a team.

I'd stand by her as an accomplished
woman and a judge...

...and she'd stand by me as a...

Reformed whoremonger?

- So you believe I was trying?
- I do.

You know what? Someday, you'll look
back on this as a growing experience.

Maybe. Someday.

Oh, who could that be?

- I ordered some takeout.
- Oh, nice.

- Italian?
- Nope.

Hi. Are you Charlie?

Yeah. Come on in.

Greek.

Be patient with me.

I'm coming off a bad breakup.

And as usual,
Alan gets chicken pot pie.

.......... ********** ..........

- Look, don't worry, you'll grow into it.
- Just once, I'd like to get clothes that fit.

Well, quit going through puberty
and we'll talk about it.

Quit being so cheap
and we'll talk about it.

Hey, hey, watch your mouth.

Hard to punish him for telling the truth.

Oh, yeah? Wait till he tries on
the underwear I bought him.

- What's that?
- A decorative bowl.

I thought it'd be perfect
to put our keys in.

Yeah, well, I don't like it. Take it back.

But it was on sale.

I don't care if you got it free with a
paid subscription to Ugly Bowl Illustrated.

I don't want it on my table.

- Why not?
- Why not?

Look around. It doesn't fit the décor.

Décor? You call this décor?

- What would you call it?
- Random crapola.

The deep-sea helmet.
The fake jazz posters.

Add an old snow sled
and baseball pennants...

...and you can open a T.G.I. Friday's.

Excuse me, but everything in this house
has a story behind it.

Oh, really? Oh, so, what's the story
behind this urn thing?

Some girl gave that to me.

- That's it?
- She spent the weekend.

- Great story.
- No, great weekend.

Okay, okay, what about this
umbrella stand that has no umbrellas?

A girl gave me that too.

- Another great weekend?
- Not so great, it was raining.

All right, why don't you pretend
a girl gave you this bowl?

It doesn't work that way.

You'd have to wear high heels and give
it to me naked, and nobody wants that.

Fine, whatever, I like the bowl.

Okay, Alan, you're not feeling me.
I don't want your bowl on my table.

I can't have one stupid thing
in this house?

Hey, leave Jake out of this.

- Very funny. You know what I mean.
- Actually, I don't.

The fact is, this house reeks of you
and your crap.

- Oh, really? Like what?
- Like this lamp.

You bought this lamp. I hate this lamp.

Why didn't you say something
two years ago?

Because I didn't notice it until recently.

The couch. You reupholstered the couch
and I liked it better the way it was.

Stained?

Hey, every one of those stains
had a story behind it.

What I'm saying is
you got nothing to complain about.

You got your food in my refrigerator,
your car in my garage...

...and your stupid flowered towels
in my guest bathroom.

Those towels are pretty.
They brighten up the whole room.

They're gay and they scream
"civil union."

Oh, they do not.

"We're here, we're queer,
dry your hands on us."

Okay, you know what?
You are being ridiculous.

When you wanna have a rational
conversation, I'll be in my room.

It's not your room, it's my guest room.

Well, obviously we disagree
about my role in this household.

We sure do.
You think you have one, and I don't.

And get rid of that welcome mat
you put on my front porch.

No one's welcome here.

Charlie, I'm telling you right now,
I am not gonna sleep with you tonight.

Where'd that come from?
Buy you a couple of drinks, invite you...

...back to my house and all of a sudden
you think I wanna sleep with you?

Well, you mean you don't?

Hey, we just met.
Let's talk, get to know each other.

If later down the road
something happens, great.

If not, we've each made a new friend.

That is very sweet.

Well, my mother raised me...

...to be respectful of women,
and I've always said...

Son of a bitch.

What?

That. That's what.

Butterscotch candies?

In about 30 seconds, they're gonna be
butterscotch suppositories.

So you noticed it.

Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

I don't want this stupid bowl
in my living room.

No, you said you didn't want it
on the front table for keys.

So I put it on the coffee table for candy.

Yeah, well,
now it's on your head for a hat.

I am sorry,
I had to set my brother straight...

I don't know why you're making
such a big deal. It is a nice bowl.

It is a hideous bowl.
It makes me nauseous just to look at it.

- You're being ridiculous. Isn't this nice?
- It's okay.

- See? Two against one.
- No, no, no. No, there's no voting.

You're just a freeloader and she's some
one-night stand I picked up at a ba...

Damn.

- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Oh, come on, don't leave.

You know what the worst part is?
I actually believed the things you said.

You're kidding.

- Thanks a lot.
- What did I do?

- You made me blow a sure thing.
- Didn't look like a sure thing.

I could have brought her around.

Why don't we just admit it? This isn't
about the bowl, this isn't about the girl.

- This is about my place in this house.
- No, no, no.

It is about the bowl, it is about the girl,
and you have no place in this house.

- You really believe that?
- What do you want from me, Alan?

I took you in. I took your kid in.

All I ask is you don't fill up my home
with your junk.

It's not junk. It's an inlaid mosaic dish
handcrafted on the island of Macao.

Yeah, well...

Now it's rubble
from the island of Macao.

I hope you're happy.

Really? I don't think you do.

Let me tell you something, Charlie.

You said you took me and my kid
into your home, but you didn't.

You took us into your house.
We made it a home.

- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

Before we got here this was an empty
space where you sat around, got drunk...

...and had sex with women
you don't care about.

There was no love, no family,
and no meaning.

There's a word for that, Alan. Utopia.

- I heard something break.
- You're just coming out now?

I was establishing my alibi.

- Well, go pack your stuff, we're leaving.
- But I have an alibi.

You're my son. Where I go, you go.

I don't remember that
in the custody agreement.

Okay, we're leaving.

- Say goodbye to your Uncle Charlie.
- Bye, Uncle Charlie.

- You don't have to go, Jake.
- See?

- Get in the car.
- But he likes me.

I'm not bluffing, Charlie.

If you're not willing to acknowledge me
as an equal member of this household...

...then I can't live here anymore.

Is that all it will take to get you to stay?

Yes.

Bye-bye.

So this is about a bowl?

- No, the bowl is a symbol.
- Of what?

- Of how your Uncle Charlie treats us.
- He treats me fine.

- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.

I don't wanna talk about this.

How come when I don't wanna talk
about stuff we still have to?

Just be quiet.

So are we going to a hotel?

We don't need hotels, buddy.

We're two single guys on the open road.
Footloose and fancy-free.

The whole world is at our feet.

If you're too cheap for a hotel,
I call the back seat.

Hello?

Hi, Mom.

Hi, Grandma.

It's late. What do you want?

Charlie and I had a fight.
Jake and I need a place to sleep.

Only because he's too cheap to get a...
We need a place to sleep.

We have nowhere else to go.

Oh, wonderful. Be right there.

Are you sure we can't sleep in the car?

Then he said
that I had no place in his house.

- Can you believe it? My own brother.
- He likes me.

Hey, when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

Then I said, if he's not willing
to acknowledge me...

...as an equal member of the household
then I can't live there anymore.

So this is about a bowl?

- No, haven't you been listening?
- Frankly, no.

Don't feel bad.
I thought it was about a bowl too.

So look, Alan, I just got back
from a long business trip...

...and your mom and I were about to...

Catch up.

Would you like to sleep
in your father's car tonight?

Actually, yes.

Look, look, we're sorry for barging in.

Jake and I will just bunk
in the guest room. Come on.

You know, I'm really getting tired
of this "where I go, you go" stuff.

Oh, great, now we have to
put on clothes for breakfast.

That's the least of our problems.

All our leather gear is in the guest room.

- Morning.
- Morning.

I couldn't help but notice the guys from
Goodwill hauling away Alan's hide-a-bed.

Oh, yeah. He doesn't live here anymore.

- No kidding. Alan's gone?
- Yep.

So you couldn't think for even a second
that I might want a hide-a-bed?

Sorry. You want some flowered towels?

Pass.

- So, what broke you two lovebirds up?
- He crossed a line.

- Must've been a big one.
- Very big.

- Was it money?
- Worse.

- A woman?
- Worse.

What's worse than money and women?

He bought an ugly bowl
and put it on the front table.

No.

When I told him to get rid of it, he filled it
with candy and put it on the coffee table.

Dear God.

- What kind of candy?
- Butterscotch.

I mean, the son of bitch.

- Are you making fun of me?
- I'm trying.

So what, you think I should just let him
put a candy dish wherever he wants?

No, you're right. He obviously had to go.

He's an ungrateful parasite
who overstepped his boundaries.

- Exactly.
- While you on the other hand...

...are a completely reasonable man
with no control issues whatsoever.

- I don't pay you to mock me.
- Charlie, you'd have to pay me not to.

Fruit. That's all you got, fruit?

Don't you ever have fruit for breakfast?

Well, yeah, Frankenberries.

Oh, well, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

If I had known you were coming,
I would've stocked up on crap.

Well, maybe we can go
crap shopping later.

So, what's the plan?

You gonna patch things up
with your brother...

...and go home?

Not until he apologizes.

- Oh, sweet Lord.
- Oh, jeez.

Don't worry, I'll find my own place.
We'll only be here a few days, tops.

Yeah, right. That's what you told
Uncle Charlie when we moved there.

If you remember, when Judith and I broke
up, you were begging me to live here.

Yes, well, I didn't have a boyfriend then
and Jake was still cute.

Alan, can we have a little man-to-man?

Sure.

I'm just going through
an awkward stage.

You hope.

Al, I know how you feel.
I had an older brother too.

- Really?
- Yep.

Scotty. I worshiped him.

But ever since I can remember...

...he did everything he could
to make my life miserable.

- That's my life with Charlie.
- No kidding.

Well, then, maybe my experience
can help you.

When my parents died, Scotty
took me in. It was just the two of us.

Then one day I got so angry with the
way he was treating me, I walked out.

I haven't seen him or talked to him in...
I don't know, maybe 35 years.

Yeah. I don't know where he lives.
I don't know whether he's alive or dead.

All I do know is he's the only family
I have left in the world.

And despite all the bad stuff,
I want him back in my life.

But it's too late for me.

I'm not going back to Charlie's
unless he apologizes.

Yep, that's what I said
about my brother Artie.

I thought his name was Scotty.

I had two brothers.

What are you doing?

Just looking.

You miss him, don't you?

No, I'm trying to figure out
if there's room for a pool table.

- Oh, hey, Teddy.
- Charlie, you got a minute?

- Sure, I guess. Come on in.
- Thanks.

Hey, what about air hockey
and a wet bar?

Hello.

- How are you?
- Better now.

Charlie?

- What?
- Introduce us, you porkhead.

Oh, sorry.
Berta, this is my mom's boyfriend Teddy.

- Teddy, my housekeeper Berta.
- A pleasure.

It could be if you play your cards right.

You'll be fine. Just don't wander
into the laundry room without backup.

Fine. Listen, I got a situation here
with your brother.

I'm sorry, Teddy. He cannot
come back until he apologizes.

- I understand, but the thing is...
- Did he tell you about the bowl?

Repeatedly.

And I know what you're going through.
I had a younger brother too.

- Really?
- Yeah, Scotty.

A worthless sponge
who lived off me for years...

...and never showed any appreciation.

- That's my life with Alan.
- No kidding.

Well then, maybe my experience
could help you.

When my parents died,
I took Scotty in...

Here's your father when he was going
through his awkward stage.

He looks exactly the same.

Which is why we can't count on you
growing out of it.

Here is your Uncle Charlie in front
of the Beverly Hills courthouse...

...when he was about 17.

- What's he look so happy about?
- Being tried as a minor.

Here's one of your Grandmommy
on a cruise to Mazatlán.

Who's that lady
with her arm around you?

Well, darling,
after your grandfather passed away...

...Grandmommy wanted
to explore her sexuality...

Mom, Mom.

- What are you doing? He's only 13.
- Oh, please.

When I was 13,
I was in an all-girls boarding school...

...and we were quite familiar...
- Mom.

Hey.

So?

No luck.

- Damn.
- What's wrong?

Everything's fine, darling.

Why don't we talk in the other room?

Last time I heard that,
I ended up in Bible camp.

- They sound angry.
- Yeah.

What do you think
they're arguing about?

I don't know.

Maybe Teddy found out
Grandma's part lesbian.

Teddy and I had a fight.

Anyway, I'm sorry.

I love you and I miss you
and I want you to come back.

What if I wanna put a bowl
on the coffee table?

Nothing would make me happier.

As soon as they leave, I'm tearing off
your clothes with my teeth.

Terrific.

You know, I like this bowl
even better than the other one.

Good.

Wasn't even on sale.

- No kidding.
- Yep.

Paid full retail, 14.99.

Anyway, I'm gonna go unpack.

- Do you need some help?
- No, I'm good.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

From the bottom of my heart...

...thank you
for being the bigger man here.

Don't mention it.

I was already seeing everything
I needed to see.

What's going on?

Remember how I recorded
those kids' songs months ago?

Yeah, they sucked.

Of course they sucked,
they're kids' songs.

The CD's coming out,

Right.

That's it. What do you think?

I'm going back to bed.

- What about you?
- You couldn't have TiVo'd this?

Hey, Charlie Waffles may love kids,
but he's getting pretty sick of you.

Oh, boy, Dharma and Greg.

I still don't understand why
you wanted to come shopping with me.

- I told you. I gotta pick up something.
- You could have just put it on the list.

Hey, maybe I just wanna
hang out with my brother.

- Really? Oh, well, that's a very nice...
- Get away, get away, get away.

Of course.

Excuse me.

Do you know
where the chewable vitamins are?

Oh, I think they're...

Oh, my God, you're him.

- I'm sorry?
- You're Charlie Waffles, right?

- You caught me.
- My daughter just loves your songs.

Oh, gee, you don't know
how that fills my heart.

There's about to be
a vomit spill on Aisle 3.

- How old is your little girl?
- Five.

No way. What, did you have her
when you were 12?

- Oh, you're sweet.
- I know.

Hey, she's not gonna believe I met you.
Can I take a picture of you?

- Better still, let's take one together.
- Oh, okay.

Excuse me, sir.
Would you take our picture?

Sir?

Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

Say "waffles."

- Waffles.
- Waffles.

- Thanks, pal.
- Thank you.

Don't let your husband see that.

He might get the wrong idea
about Charlie Waffles.

- Oh, there is no husband.
- No kidding?

Oh, my God.

Jodie is gonna love this.
I'm gonna save it for her birthday.

Her birthday's coming up?

- This weekend, she'll be 6.
- Oh, what a magical age.

Tell you what. How would Jodie like
a free Charlie Waffles birthday concert?

You would do that?

Who loves kids?

Charlie Waffles.

Right. Call me.

Look, it's got a little waffle on it.
How adorable.

I told you I had to pick something up.

Grandma may smell funny

Hug her anyway
So hug her anyway

Sing
Hug her anyway

Pretty catchy, huh?

So is gonorrhea.

Drinking from the well of bitterness,
are we?

I just don't understand
what kind of spiteful god...

...could allow my drunken
whoremonger of a brother...

...to become a children's singing star...

...while I toil away
in poverty-stricken anonymity.

You wanna talk to me about toiling away
in poverty-stricken anonymity?

No. Sorry.
I'm sure you've got it worse than I do.

Whoa, whoa, I wouldn't go that far.

What I'm trying to say is...

...there's another way to look at this.
- What's that?

We're all in this together.

Your brother's success is our success.
His home is our home.

And most importantly, when
he's got a load on, his car is my car.

Hey, Berta, guess what.

- I got another big royalty check.
- Oh, hey, good for you.

- Why don't you celebrate with a drink?
- Well, I think I will.

- Hey, Alan, guess what.
- Yeah, I heard.

Another big check.

You know what's a great place
to pick up single moms?

- The parking lot of Chuck E. Cheese.
- You didn't.

And not just moms. Nannies, aunts...

...and a couple of very doable grandmas.

Do you have any shame?

No, why?

Hello?

Hang on.

Who loves kids?

Oh, hey, Artie.
Just got the check. Thanks.

What's up?

Sure, I'll sign some CDs. Where?

They got bookstores just for kids?
Who knew?

Everyone but you.

Okay, I'll be there. Thanks a lot.

- Hey, Alan, guess what.
- There is no God?

Oh, on the contrary,
there is a God, and he love me long time.

Who barfed in the fishbowl?

Love, Charlie Waffles.

There you go, Dakota.

- What do we say to Mr. Waffles?
- Thank you, Mr. Waffles.

No, thank you, sweetheart.
And thank you, Mommy.

So tell me, is there a Mrs. Waffles?

- Sadly, no.
- Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

Come on, honey.

Oh, it do indeed.

This guy's a phenomenon.

The label's moved 100,000 units

I'm sorry, who are you?

Oh, I'm Artie Pliskin. President
and CEO of Fluffy Bunny Records.

- And you are?
- Alan, Charlie's brother.

Oh, you're the sponge. It's a pleasure.

Same here.

- Do you believe in God, Artie?
- I'll tell you what I believe in.

Regular prostate exams, full-release
massage and Charlie freaking Waffles.

Okay, kids, Charlie Waffles
needs to take a little potty break...

...but he'll be right back.

In the meantime,
why don't you all sing along?

It's potty time
Can 't hold it

Can 't hold it
Can 't hold it

Here, put this
in the "Mommy and Me" pile.

I'll be right back.

This is nothing compared to the concert
he's gonna give next weekend.

- Concert?
- Concert?

Twelve-hundred
screaming kids and moms...

...all dying to hear
Charlie Waffles sing in person.

Twelve-hundred?

At 50 bucks a pop.

Wait, wait a minute. He's gonna
make $60,000 off one concert?

Yeah. Good time to be a sponge, huh?

I'm not doing any concerts.

- Why not?
- Because I'm not. Case closed.

What's up with him?

It would appear he's displeased with the
latest gold nugget to fall out of his ass.

Yeah, well, trust me.

The gold's gonna keep coming,
even if I have to get it myself.

Potty
Potty

So?

Waffle for your thoughts?

- Leave me alone.
- I don't understand.

I would think a sold-out concert
would be good news for Charlie Waffles.

- Yeah, well, it's not.
- Because?

You ever wonder
why I never played in a band?

I just figured you were
getting laid so much...

...being in a rock band
would seem redundant.

That's not the reason.

Although I did do better
than most bass players.

Okay, then what is the reason?

- I have stage fright.
- You have stage fright?

Severe, debilitating,
wet-your-pants stage fright.

I don't understand.

I've seen you perform.

Well, sure, in the living room
for a couple of people.

But on a stage with lights,
in front of a crowd paying to see me...

Do you literally pee your pants?

What difference does it make?

I'm just saying your audience
is composed of bed wetters.

They might get a kick out of
seeing you soil yourself.

- And you think that'd be funny?
- No, I wouldn't.

But I'm not your audience.

Hello?

I don't know what to tell you, Artie.
I can't do it.

- I don't need a reason why.
- Just tell him the truth.

It's show business, Alan,
you don't tell people the truth.

Look, I'll make the CDs,
I'll shoot the commercials...

...I'll even do the bookstores.
Just no concerts.

Hey, I don't have to do anything.

Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do, sue me?

Really?

- Can he sue me?
- Did you sign a contract?

What time is the concert?

Okay, see you Saturday night.

Wait, wait, wait. Eleven a. M?

Who goes to concerts at 11 a. M?

Oh, yeah.

Stupid kids.

It's quarter to 1

You want to have a little fun

You brush your teeth

What are you watching?

The master at work.

You wake up in the morning
And it's quarter to 2

You want to find something to do
You brush your teeth

Oh, Raffi,
you magnificent son of a bitch.

How do you do it?
How does he do it, Alan?

What's he got that I don't?

Well, based on first impressions...

...I'd say, a genuine love of children,
and bladder control.

- Well, that was just a cheap shot.
- I take them when I get them.

Look at him. All relaxed and smiling.

Last time I was
in front of an audience like that...

...seventh-grade talent show...

...I started shaking, sweating,
felt like I wanted to throw up.

Don't forget peeing in your pants.

You keep pitching me fat ones.

- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- Oh, come on.

Look, if you knew in the seventh grade
that you couldn't perform...

...why'd you become a musician?

Because there's one thing
I am more afraid of than an audience.

What's that? An honest day's work?

If you knew the answer,
why'd you ask the question?

Charlie Waffles. Charlie Waffles.

Where the hell is he, Alan?

I don't know. He said he wanted to
take a walk to calm himself down.

I promise you,
I will crucify that son of a bitch.

The two of you will be
in a box over a heating vent...

...when I get through suing him.

Could it be a box with a guest room?

Hey, Alan.

I figured out what went wrong
in seventh grade.

What?

I hadn't started drinking yet.

- Charlie, you have to get out there.
- Right.

The little bastards await.

You can't sue him
if he just stinks, right?

Who loves kids?

Charlie Waffles.

You're damn right.

That one's not on the CD.

Let's try this again.

I drink from a sippy cup
Sippy cup, sippy cup

I drink from a sippy cup
'Cause I'm a big kid now

Come on

I drink from a sippy cup
Sippy cup, sippy cup

I drink from a sippy cup
'Cause I'm a big kid now

Bye-bye, boobies

They love him.

How can they love him?

Who cares? We're gonna make a fortune.

- Doesn't it bother you that he's loaded?
- He's a musician.

It'd bother me if he wasn't.

Bye-bye, boobies

Bye-bye, boobies

Bye-bye, boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

Who loves boobies?

Charlie Waffles.

Right.

I love boobies
I love boobies

I love boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

Come on

I love boobies
I love boobies

I love boobies
'Cause I'm a big kid now

- Hi.
- Hey.

- What are you doing up so late?
- I couldn't sleep.

- Something bothering you?
- It's nothing.

Oh, come on, I'm your brother.
You can tell me anything.

Well, the truth is,
your life has been going so great lately.

It's been bringing up
a lot of old resentment in me...

Who loves kids?

Charlie Waffles.

For the first time anywhere,
if your kids love Charlie Waffles...

... they'll love him even more, live.

When Mom 's a big meanie
And serves you zucchini

What do you do?

What do you do?

Feed it to the dog

Feed it to the dog

That's right.

Charlie's first sold-out concert
can be yours on D VD for only 29.99.

Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Who could it be?

Who barfed in the fishbowl?
Oh, wait, it's me

Fish food, fish food
I made some fish food

Fish food, fish food
Mommy, come and see

Plus, if you order now...

You know what's funny, Alan?

I was so hammered,
I have no memory of that concert.

Gee, that is funny.

- Oh, Charlie Waffles.
- Yeah, baby?

Who loves boobies?

Coming.

Excuse me.
Time to butter up the old waffle.

Yeah, well, thanks for the talk.

What talk?

Go, butter.

It's potty time
Can 't hold it

Can 't hold it
Can 't hold it

Potty, potty, potty

Potty

- Potty, potty, potty
- Potty

I'm not wearing a diaper
And I'm not in the pool

Get out of the bathroom
Gotta go, fool

- Potty, potty, potty
- Potty

Might be number one
It might be number two

I don 't know yet
And neither do you

Potty, potty, potty

.......... ********** ..........

I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

Darling,
I never thought I'd find love again.

I not only found it,
but I found the love of my life.

To Evelyn.

- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

That poor, clueless bastard.

It's like watching a dog
stick his face in a fan.

You don't do that more than once.

I am the lucky one in this relationship.

And I promise you, darling...

...I am going to be the best wife
I possibly can.

To Teddy.

- Teddy.
- To Teddy.

That poor, clueless bastard.

- So can we go now?
- No, we can't. It would be rude.

I don't mind being rude.

You just talking or you got a plan?

Well, if I eat enough shrimp,
I can make myself puke.

Then start eating.

Okay, stop it, both of you.
There will be no puking.

We're gonna stay,
congratulate the happy couple...

...mingle a bit,
and then I'm gonna fake a migraine.

- You can do that?
- Hell, yeah.

I spent 12 years watching my wife
fake migraines and orgasms.

I'd go with the migraine.

Thanks for coming, fellas.
Means a lot to me.

Wouldn't miss it.

We wish you a lifetime
of love and happiness. Right, Charlie?

Well, yeah, but he seems
hell-bent on marrying Mom.

Hey, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

That's okay, doodlebug.

Just glad you could make it.

Charlie, Alan, Jake,
this is my daughter, Courtney.

Honey,
these are Evelyn's sons and grandson.

I'm the grandson.

- Oh, well, it's nice to finally meet you all.
- Nice to meet you too.

So, Teddy, what's the deal?

All this time, you've been hiding
this beautiful woman from us?

Just from you, Charlie.

- Fair enough.
- Dad's a little overprotective.

I can see why.

Charlie, why don't you and I
get Courtney a drink?

I'd like to get Courtney a house.

Walk with me.

- How's your headache, Dad?
- Not yet. So...

Courtney, you have amazing posture.
Do you see a chiropractor?

- No.
- Would you like to?

- Charlie, I need you to do me a favor.
- Anything for you, Teddy. Name it.

- Stay away from Courtney.
- Name something else.

- Charlie, this is important.
- Don't worry.

I think too much of you
to wanna, you know...

...do what I wanna do
with your daughter.

- I appreciate that.
- Consider it a wedding present.

- Thanks.
- No, seriously, that's all you get.

Courtney, dear,
what a surprise to see you.

- Well, I told you I was coming.
- Yes, but the party started an hour ago.

So I naturally assumed that something
had come up that was more important...

...than your father's happiness.

Well, Evelyn, you know
what they say about assuming.

When you assume, you're just a bitch.

- Courtney, there are children present.
- She means me, but I'm fine with it.

Thank you, dear.

You should hear
what they call her at home.

- Have some shrimp.
- Oh, boy.

- Well, great party, but we gotta go.
- Oh, already?

Yeah. We'd love to stay,
but Alan's got a headache.

Not yet.

Not yet debilitating,
but I do need to lay down.

Hey, before you go, my dad
had mentioned that you like nice cars.

- Yeah.
- I do too.

Swell.

Here's my card.
Maybe I can help you out someday.

Whoa, Ferraris, Lamborghinis.

They say driving one is the most fun
you can have with your pants on.

Well, that's how I like to drive.
With my pants on.

Otherwise,
the leather kind of sticks to my thighs.

Well, you should come down sometime.
I'll give you a test drive.

- Actually, I'm really not a Ferrari guy.
- I'm not either.

- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

We really gotta get our signals straight.
I mean, you made me look stupid.

Don't blame your father for that.

I'm telling you right now,
I'm not having any more children.

Terrific.

Hello?

No, it's Alan.

Oh, hi, Courtney.

Well, it was very nice
meeting you last night too.

Oh, I'm sorry...

...I had no idea that you were planning
on using a fake migraine to get out early.

So, what did you do?

Menstrual cramps.

Yeah, I can't get away with that.

Although sometimes
I'll use irritable bowel syndrome.

And...

Okay, I'll get Charlie.

It's Teddy's daughter.
She wants to talk to you.

- Really?
- You promised Teddy you'd stay away.

Hey, I didn't tell her to call me.

What kind of man
would hit on his future stepsister?

You're just making it hotter for him.

Give me the phone, give me the phone.

Hi, Courtney, what's up?

That's nice, but I told you,
I'm really not into Ferraris.

A Bentley?
Oh, it's a little more my style.

Okay, I guess I could come by
and take a peek at it.

First a peek, then a poke.

Uncalled for.

Two o'clock? Great. I'll see you then.

I swear this is just business.

I'm going to look at a Bentley
she got in on trade.

I can get it for dealer cost.

- Since when do you need a Bentley?
- Nobody needs a Bentley, Alan.

Just like nobody needs
to date a woman half their age.

But if you want one,
it doesn't hurt to have the other.

Did Teddy tell you
to stay away from his daughter too?

- No.
- Yeah, why would he?

Pretty hot, isn't it?

Oh, yeah. But it's not really my thing.

Gee, I think a guy like you
would look great in one of these.

- You think?
- Absolutely.

Here. Slide on into it. See how it feels.

What about the Bentley?

I got the guys in the back washing it up
for you. We have a few minutes.

Sure, why not.

That's always been my motto.

Oh, pretty snug.

Tight's good, don't you think?

Sure, tight's good.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

So where do they put the engine
in these things?

They put it where it belongs. In the rear.

- So no stick?
- No, you shift from the wheel.

Let me show you.

Left side down, right side up.

You don't need a stick.

And yet I've got one anyway.

- Is that your cell phone?
- Boy, I hope so.

Excuse me.

Hello?

Oh, hey, hey, hey. Teddy, how are you?

Good. Me? I'm fine.

Just running some errands.

Yeah, I'll be around tomorrow.
Drop by anytime.

Great. I'll see you then.

That was your dad.

He wants to talk to me and Alan
about something.

I heard.

- Has he ever said anything about me?
- You? Let me think.

He told you to stay away from me,
didn't he?

Oh, yeah, there was that.

I can't believe
he's still trying to control my life.

Hey, your dad loves you.

He's just trying to protect you from,
well, in this case, me.

I'm a big girl, Charlie,
I can take care of myself.

I'm sure you can.

I can also take care of
whoever I choose to be with.

I'm sure you can.

Listen, I appreciate the offer,
but I think I'm gonna pass.

On the Bentley.

But you haven't even seen it yet.

And right now, it's all wet and soapy,
just waiting for you.

Are we still talking about a car?

What do you think?

I think I should probably get out
before I set off the air bag.

And then she leaned over real close
to play with the... paddles.

The what?

The paddle shifters
on the steering wheel.

I had another picture entirely.

But I restrained myself.

I walked away,
and now I can still look Teddy in the eye.

That's great.

But how come you have no problem
looking me in the eye...

...after sleeping with my wife's sister,
my son's teacher, my divorce lawyer...

...and my old receptionist?

I like Teddy.

- And the receptionist was your fault.
- How?

If you'd paid her a decent salary,
she wouldn't have had to hook.

I brought the Bentley.

Come on, Courtney. I told you I can't.

Just one little test drive.
What do you have to lose?

Well, there's my integrity, my self
respect, my relationship with your father...

Give me the damn keys.

Is your brother still in bed
with his sister?

Stepsister.

To-be.

And yes.

Wow, how long has it been?

About 18 hours.

Good thing he's got supplies up there.

- He does?
- Sure.

Water, power bars, fresh batteries, rope.

Oh, like an earthquake kit.

I guess you could use that stuff
for earthquakes.

Oh, crap.

Misdirected anger. You'll get used to it.

- What are you guys doing here?
- We came to talk with you and Charlie.

Didn't he tell you?

He never tells me anything. I don't know
half of what he does nor do I want to.

It's his life and he alone should suffer
the consequences. Come on in.

- Is he even home?
- I'll check.

Why don't you make yourselves
comfortable...

...and I'll check.

Because I have no idea.

So I'll need to check.

Is he on something?

If only.

What?

Teddy and Mom are downstairs.

- What the hell are they doing here?
- Apparently, you invited them.

- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

On the phone, remember? Hey, Alan.

Hi, Courtney, how are you doing?
Charlie, they're waiting.

Yeah, we got a problem here.

No, sir, you've got a problem.
I made no promise, I broke no promise.

- You actually made a promise?
- Yeah.

- And I really tried to keep it.
- He did.

I could sense his inner conflict as we
did it in the back seat of the Bentley.

Look, just stall them. I'll be right down.

Fine. But know this,
I am not taking the fall for you.

- How could you take the fall for me?
- I don't know.

But it always seems to work out
that when you get laid, I get screwed.

Just go.

- Great. Just great.
- Hey, have you seen my dress?

- Why?
- I ain't going down like this.

You're not going down at all.

Why not?
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

Here, hit rewind.
I'm sure you'll find something.

I just can't believe he's still in bed.

He's a drunk, Mom.
That's what they do.

Oh, come on, Evelyn,
give the kid a break.

He was probably out late last night
sowing wild oats.

He's 40 years old,
he has no more wild oats.

Just warmed-over cream of wheat.

Hey, hey, look who's here.

Well, thanks for interrupting
your stupor and joining us.

I can get back to my stupor anytime.
So, what's going on?

Your mother and I wanted to
talk about the wedding.

You've got my blessing. What else?

Well, we wondered if you would mind
having the ceremony here.

Sure. Terrific.

On the deck, in here, on the beach,
wherever you want. What else?

Don't you wanna think about it?

What's to think about? It's perfect.
Have the ceremony, the reception.

Alan and I'll clear out. You can use this
place for your honeymoon. It's broken in.

The house, not Mom.

Do you have one of your
little pop tarts up there?

No, no, just my alarm.
If I'm not up by 4 in the afternoon...

...I feel like I've wasted the whole day.
Be right back.

- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm bored.

- You're bored?
- Yeah. I wanna go downstairs.

No, no, no, you can't go downstairs.
Find something else to do.

Well, I'd love to sell you a car.

Yeah, very funny.

No, I'm serious.

You wanna sell me a car now?

Or I could go downstairs.

You wouldn't.

I would.

Wait a minute.

You planned this.
You knew they were coming over today.

Well, a good salesman pays attention.

- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Okay, okay, okay, you win.

- Give me a price on the Bentley.
- The Bentley's no longer available.

I'm thinking the Ferrari.

- I don't want a Ferrari.
- And I don't want to stay up here.

- Charlie, we're waiting.
- Coming.

Okay, fine.

But let me just say,
this is no way to treat family.

Here we go, blue eyes.

- I made it myself.
- Oh, thank you.

- Nothing for me, thanks.
- I don't recall offering.

Sorry, sorry.

So, wedding on the beach. Great.
I'll take care of everything.

- Thanks for stopping by.
- Well, there is one more thing.

- Name it.
- Well...

Excuse me.
Berta, this is a family matter.

If you only knew.

Here's the deal.

I never had any sons of my own,
just the one daughter.

- And she's great. Isn't she great, Alan?
- Well, I hardly met her.

- Me neither. I'm sure she's great.
- She's terrific.

But I've grown very fond
of the two of you.

And I'd like to ask you to stand up
with me when I marry your mother.

- Teddy, that's quite an honor.
- Yeah. I'm really touched.

Snooze button.
I must have hit the snooze button.

Excuse me.

I don't use the snooze button.
When I'm up, I'm up.

Of course, I'm not a drunk.

Are you out of your mind?

I prefer to think of myself as a go-getter.
All right, now you're gonna wanna...

...sign here, here, here,
and initial where the little flags are.

This is twice as much as the Bentley.
I can't afford this.

Well, if you need help
with the down payment...

...I'm sure I could ask my dad
to help you out. He really loves you.

Fine.

Here. And here. And here.

And here. And here.

- What's this?
- Oh, that's the extended warranty.

Just a little extra protection.

I think it's a bit late for that.

Congratulations. You now own a Ferrari.

Yippee.

Charlie.

What now?

I'm gonna need a check.

You know, this is the most
I have ever spent for sex.

But not by much.

Okay, Mom,
I guess I'll see you at the wedding.

Charlie, the wedding
isn't for six months.

Yeah, but it's bad luck
to see the bride beforehand.

Thanks again, fellas. You being a part
of this shindig means a lot to me.

Our pleasure, Teddy. Bye-bye.

Congratulations.
Once again, you get off scot-free.

Free? You think that was free?

- Charlie.
- Yeah, hey, hi.

I wanted you to know
I'm not gonna say anything...

...about you and Courtney.
They don't get along.

Okay, great. Wait, wait, wait.

You knew? How did you know?

I just noticed the car outside
with her dealer plates on it.

You couldn't have noticed that
on the way in?

- How much did she take you for?
- Don't ask.

- Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

So you were trying to protect me?

Hey, you're a good kid.

And Courtney, well, I love her,
but she is kind of a sociopath.

Bye now.

- You know what this means, don't you?
- What?

I'm gonna need an eight-car garage.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, yeah. I am a finely tuned machine.

- Hello.
- Are you a friend of Charlie's?

I'm his brother.

So, no.

- I'm Gabrielle.
- Nice to meet you.

I'm Alan.

Or, as you would say, "Alan."

Why would I say that?

No reason. I'm a little dehydrated.

- So you are a cyclist.
- A what?

A cyclist? You know, with your bicycle.

Yes, yes. I'm very passionate about...

..."bicycling."

I even have a stationary "cycle."

I also jog and ab-crunch...

...and, of course, les buns of steel.

- Nice, huh?
- Nice? She's magnificent.

- You should see her naked.
- Can I?

Well, I could show you some pictures...

...but you may not wanna see
that much of me.

Just out of curiosity,
where do you find women like that?

And, more importantly, how do you
get them to go to bed with you?

- You really wanna know?
- Yeah. What's your secret?

Well, you see, Alan, it's like this:

I got a knack.

- That's not a secret.
- Well, I didn't think so, but you asked.

- So that's it? You've got a knack?
- Hey, everybody's good at something.

You, for instance...

...have no shame.

Excuse me, this is what they wear
in the Tour de France.

Alan, I just took a Tour de France.

And the only thing I was wearing
was a smile and a condom.

- Hi, Judith. Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

What's the matter with him?

- His little girlfriend broke up with him.
- Oh, no.

Yeah. I was hoping you could
talk to him, because, let's face it...

...who knows more
about getting dumped?

- Don't flatter me, Judith. I'll talk to him.
- I'm sorry.

- That didn't come out the way I meant it.
- Really? How did you mean it?

Couldn't you just take the "I'm sorry"?

Couldn't you have just loved me?

- Did I hear Numbnuts come in?
- Numbnuts?

Sorry. Numbnuts Jr.

- Lf you mean my son, yes, he's here.
- Crap.

- What are you doing?
- Hiding my cookies.

- Why?
- Because I just bought a new bag...

...and I don't want that knucklehead
to eat them all.

Oh, Charlie. You hide your cookies
from a little boy who loves you?

"Little boy," my ass.
He's a bottomless pit.

And I'm tired of going for a snack and
having to lick cookie dust out of the bag.

You might wanna take it easy on him.

- He's going through a breakup.
- Really?

Yeah.

Nope. My cookies.

- So how was school this week?
- Okay.

- Anything noteworthy happen?
- No.

Thought you said he got dumped.

- I was easing into it.
- Oh, good idea. Go ahead.

Jake, sooner or later,
every guy gets dumped.

Some guys get dumped sooner and later,
right, Alan?

Sorry. I should've eased into that.

My point is, you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

I'm not embarrassed. I'm angry.
She didn't even tell me why.

She just sent me an e-mail saying she
doesn't wanna go out with me anymore.

Maybe she found somebody better.

What do you mean, better?
Who's better than Jake?

Why, no one, Alan.

He's the pinnacle of male evolution.

Thank you.

Look, buddy,
I know exactly how you feel.

When I was your age,
I was dating a beautiful girl:

Charity Kirschenbaum.
I was crazy about her.

Then, the night before junior prom,
she called and dumped me.

Wouldn't even give me a reason.
I was devastated.

- So, what'd you do?
- What could I do?

How can you mend a broken heart?

How can you stop the rain
From falling down?

- You done?
- Unless you wanna hear "Jive Talkin'."

The thing is, Jake...

...that no matter how bad you feel now,
eventually, it'll pass.

You just have to be willing
to live with the pain.

- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

Hang on, Dad.
What do you mean, no, I don't?

When you get dumped, don't
sit around feeling sorry for yourself.

You go out and find another girl,
a better girl.

Okay, but how am I
gonna get another girl?

I don't know how I got this one.

You don't know
how you got a girlfriend?

No, it just kind of happened.

Yeah, I know how that goes.

Wake up in the morning, and there
she is. Shut up. I know that was wrong.

Look, Jake,
who is the cutest girl in your class?

- Nicole O'Malley.
- Okay, call Nicole O'Malley...

...and ask her out.
- You drunk?

A little.

But this is a secret that will
serve you for the rest of your life:

The hotter the girl, the Ionelier she is...

...because most guys
are too scared to talk to her.

- Really?
- Really?

Trust me.

Why couldn't you have said this
20 years ago?

Come on, Dad.
I wasn't even born 20 years ago.

I really shouldn't be giving him advice
that could help him reproduce, should I?

Oh, it's just you.

Hey.

What are you doing?

I am drinking some of your finest Scotch
and looking at my high-school yearbook.

Charity Kirschenbaum.

I can't help wondering
how my life would've turned out...

...if she hadn't dumped me.

Come on, your life turned out great.

Well, it wouldn't have turned out
any better.

You know what?

I'm gonna call her
and find out why she broke my heart.

Good thinking.

Call your high-school girlfriend drunk
at 2 in the morning.

While you're at it, why don't you expose
yourself to an undercover policewoman?

Some people do that.

I need closure. I need to understand
why she dumped me.

What's to understand?

This is her.

This is you.

Peaches-and-cream complexion.

You.

Cheerleader.

You.

Stop me any time.

I don't care. I got her number
off the Internet, and I'm calling her.

Oh, man.

When are they gonna invent a phone
with a Breathalyzer lock?

It's ringing.

Hello?

Hello? Is this Charity?

Hi, Charity. This is Alan Harper.

Yeah, yeah, from high school.

Anyway...

Yeah, I know it's late.

Yeah, I know I'm drunk.

Listen, I just need to ask you
one question.

Why did you dump me
on the night before junior prom?

Okay. Okay.

Okay, thanks. Go back to sleep.

She said, to ask my brother, Cha...

- rlie.

Oh, that's why.

Morning.

Morning.

You found the stash, huh?

Wasn't well-hidden.

Okay, just for the record,
that stuff's medicinal.

I've got glaucoma.

- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- So where'd you disappear to last night?
- Me?

I decided to take a little drive...

...give you a chance to calm down
about Charity Kirschenbaum.

- I'm perfectly calm.
- Good.

Who's Charity Kirschenbaum?

It's just a little thing that's
not worth getting upset about, and...

Hey, what the hell are you doing
with my cookies?

- They're yours?
- You know they're mine.

Oh, so you're saying I took something
that belonged to you, and you're upset?

Oh, come on, Alan.

I loved Charity Kirschenbaum, and
you stole her right out from under me.

He's speaking metaphorically, right?

Yeah. He was never on top of that.

- I would've been, if it weren't for you.
- Okay, fine. I took your girl 20 years ago.

That calls for maybe five, six cookies,
tops, not the whole damn bag.

I had to go to junior prom
with cousin Phoebe.

- She was cute.
- She was 12 and in a body cast.

Well, so what? She was your cousin.

She could've been 18
and in a cellophane bikini...

...and you weren't gonna get any.

You are a horrible human being,
and I hope you burn in hell.

- So we're good?
- No! We're not good!

We suck!

- Freshen that up for you?
- Thanks.

You betrayed me!

I hate you!

I hate you! I hate you!

I hate you!

Sounds like he's going for a bike ride.

Hello? Nicole O'Malley?

Jake Harper here.

Harper. I sit next to you
in geometry class.

No, the other side.

Yeah, with the big head.

I was wondering if you would go
to the winter dance with me.

Really? Are you sure?

Well, great.
I guess I'll see you at school. Bye.

- Uncle Charlie's a genius.
- In a sense.

But there's book smart and "look smart."

- Would you get that, Berta?
- What?

- The door.
- I can't hear you.

- I said, would you get the door?
- I can't. I'm upstairs.

Hi, Judith. Jake, your mom's here.

- Did you talk to him?
- I did.

- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey. How's it going?

- Great. Uncle Charlie's a genius.
- Good, good.

- You said you talked to him.
- I did.

- Then why is Uncle Charlie a genius?
- Because he never got married.

Oh, that's gonna come back
to bite me in the ass.

And here it comes, jaws a-snapping.

All right, I'm sorry.

Why are you sorry?

I just find it's easier that way.

Okay. Is Charlie at home?

Oh, no.
He went out a couple of hours ago.

I've been trying to call him on his cell,
but he doesn't answer.

- Well, please tell him I stopped by.
- Sure thing.

Gabrielle?

Forgive me if I'm out of line...

...but I sense a Ioneliness inside you.

- Is it so obvious?
- I'm right?

Oh, yes. But how could you know?

We're two of a kind.

I myself have tasted
the saltiness of Ionely tears.

- We have much to share.
- We do indeed. Come on in.

First his cookies, now his croissant.

Well, in my experience, I've found that
the more beautiful the woman is...

...the Ionelier she is.

That's very true. How do you
know so much about women?

What can I say? I have a knack.

- Hey.
- Oh, hello, Charlie.

Gee, how embarrassing.

- What are you talking about?
- Oh, dear. This is so difficult.

No, it's not. Go ahead, tell him. Tell him.

Charlie, you're a wonderful man, but
your brother, he really understands me.

So, what are you saying?

It's just...

l...

- I can't.
- I can. She's dumping you for me.

This is so awkward. I must go.

Please forgive me?

How does it feel?

- I'm stunned.
- Good, good. What else?

- You snaked my girlfriend?
- Yes, I did.

I snaked her. Like a cobra.

- And you did it just to hurt me?
- Well, not just to hurt you.

Well, yeah, just to hurt you.

I don't know what to say.

- I'm crushed.
- That's good. Say that. "I'm crushed."

My own brother
purposefully set out to hurt me.

Oh, no. Oh, no.
You're not taking this away from me.

What about you
and Charity Kirschenbaum?

I was 17, Alan. I was a horny idiot.
But you, you're an adult.

Okay. I see where you're going,
and it's not gonna work.

You're not taking this away from me.

I really thought our relationship
had grown beyond this petty crap.

I thought I could count on you.

I thought you were my friend.

Son of a bitch. He took it away from me.

Oh, hey. You're here.

Where am I gonna go, Alan?

- You took my girl.
- And I feel awful about that.

- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter. I made a terrible mistake.

I did the worst thing I could possibly do.

I lowered myself to your level.

You know what I mean.
I love you. You're my brother.

- I wouldn't hurt you for the world.
- Actions speak louder than words.

You're right. Okay. Here's an action.

You bought me a bag of cookies.

Sure, that should make up
for stealing Gabrielle.

How about three bags?

And I'm breaking it off with her.
You can have her back.

Have her back?

What is wrong with you?
She's not a lawn mower you borrowed.

You can't just hose off the blades
and give her back.

- But... But...
- "But" nothing.

She dumped me because she likes you.
So, what are you gonna say to her, Alan?

"I was just using you to punish Charlie
for something that happened"?

I probably wouldn't use those words.

You can't ease your conscience
about hurting me by hurting her.

So you're saying
you want me to keep seeing her?

I'm saying
I want you to do the right thing.

- And then you'll forgive me?
- Yes, then I'll forgive you.

Well, okay.

For you,
I'll keep seeing the gorgeous woman.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

- Okay, so, what's the catch?
- Catch?

I don't know what you're talking about.

So are you sure
everything's okay with Charlie?

Everything's great with Charlie.
Charlie's fine. Forget Charlie.

Well, you know, like the song:

Okay.

I'm ready.

- Excuse me?
- Go ahead.

Get it over with.

- I'm not sure I follow.
- Do what you have to do.

Just hurry.

But don't you wanna start
with some kissing...

...and, you know, foreplay?

No, thank you.

How about a smile?

Better?

Actually, worse.

Could you close your eyes again?

- Where are you going?
- I have to brush my teeth.

The bathroom's that way.

Yeah, but my toothbrush is at home.
Bye-bye.

- Hey.
- Hey.

How'd it go with Gabrielle?

- I think you know how it went.
- Yeah, I do.

It's kind of like necrophilia, isn't it?

- I didn't go through with it.
- Really?

I guess we're different that way.

So I didn't really
steal her from you, did I?

- Nope.
- You were trying to get rid of her.

Yep. But I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.
Thanks for helping me out with that.

Well, at least now we're even, right?

- Not quite.
- What do you mean?

Charlie. Coming back to bed?

- Charity? Charity Kirschenbaum?
- Oh, hi, Alan. Long time no see.

Yeah, 20 years.

She looks great, doesn't she?

- Come on, baby.
- But...

Now we're even.

I hate you!

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Well, that was just lovely.

I do aim to please.

And after last time,
I appreciate the aiming.

Hey, we made good time.
I can let the babysitter go early.

The key is efficient foreplay.

Minimal attention to each breast
before I meander to your dander.

- Spoon?
- Sure.

And switch.

- That was fun.
- It always is.

Okay, well, drive safe.

- I always do.
- I know, I'm just a worrier.

I know you are.

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

I get more tongue from my butcher.

I'm sorry, did you consider
making your presence known?

Clear your throat, maybe a little cough?

I wanted to vomit, but I was
afraid it might break the mood.

Hey, hey. Postcoital kissing
is always more platonic.

- Is it?
- Yes, because, well...

...we both know
where our mouths have been.

I see.

But in the bedroom,
there was a lot of saliva...

...and heat, and friction,
believe you me.

- Really?
- Yes, really.

It may not have been
crazy, hot, monkey sex...

...like when we first started dating.

But it was very much in the
general category of jungle humping.

- Jungle humping?
- Yes.

Maybe not tree swinging...

...but certainly canoodling
on some low-hanging branches.

You poor bastard.

Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

This is what an adult relationship
looks like, Charlie.

People get comfortable with each other
and develop a routine.

And if it's not always fireworks
and explosions...

...well, that's a reasonable trade
for a warm, collegial partnership.

You poor, poor bastard.

This conversation is over.

If only.

Okay, it's boring. It's suffocating.

It's a deathwatch,
but what choice do I have, Charlie?

Pretend I'm you? I'm not you.

I'm monogamous, settle-down guy
who hangs onto a relationship...

...until I'm looking at divorce papers
or the pointy end of a steak knife.

Oh, that's a load of crap.

You're afraid if you let go of these
broads you're never gonna get laid again.

Didn't I just say that?

Boxing sucks.

As always,
you're entitled to your stupid opinion.

Why are you making it personal?
I didn't make it personal.

In Ultimate Fighting, they kick, elbow.

They get a guy down
and smash his head in the floor.

These guys just dance around
and barely hit each other.

Okay, okay, listen to me.

Boxing is a science.

Boxers don't just
whale on each other...

...they strategize, feel each other out,
wait for an opening.

Gay.

And what's with the little pillows
on their hands?

Even if they hit each other,
it wouldn't hurt.

Oh, does that hurt?

- Yeah.
- Good.

- Hey, what are you doing?
- Uncle Charlie hit me.

Good.

- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you later.

Tell him now, I got better things to do.

You promised he'd grow on me.

I lied.

- So where were you?
- Well, I thought about what you said...

...and I went over to Donna's house
to break up with her.

- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

I'm gonna meet her parents
next weekend.

- But you just said...
- I know, but I couldn't do it.

I'm not capable
of rejecting another human being.

Wow, I'd think after all these years,
you'd wanna get even.

I am in trouble here, Charlie.

How do I get out of a stagnant,
joyless relationship?

If I knew how to do that,
you wouldn't still be living here.

Okay, first...

...you gotta get your mind right.
- How do I do that?

Close your eyes
and imagine a parallel world...

...where there's an Alan Harper
exactly like you.

Except he's got a set of balls.

- You wanna help me here or not?
- Hey, it's gotta be fun for me too.

Fine. We'll just assume
that your mind is right.

Now, before you do the actual dumping,
there's a few things you gotta consider.

Like what?

Does she have embarrassing photographs
that could wind up on the Internet...

...if she takes it badly?

I'm not sure.

What do you mean?

Well, there's one of me naked,
but I'm wearing a mask and a cape.

- I thought the sex was mundane.
- Sadly, it still was.

Whatever, she can't use the picture.

Does she have your
credit card information?

- No.
- Don't answer so quickly.

I once handed a date my Visa
so she could pump gas for me...

...and on my next statement
there were charges...

...for a boob job and a PlayStation 3.

And I never got to play
with either one of them.

You made your date pump gas?

I liked the song that was on the radio.

But back to the topic at hand.
Does she own any chick weapons?

Chick weapons?

You know, little guns, Tasers,
pepper spray.

Well, there's a baseball bat
by her front door...

...but I think that's for intruders.

Yeah, I've made that mistake too.

Okay. Let's talk about
the where, when and how.

Where: Always break up in public place.
That way you avoid having a scene.

- That makes sense.
- When:

Before the desert menu comes out.
Otherwise, you can find yourself...

...with a lap full of hot coffee,
which is not as fun as it sounds.

That doesn't sound fun.

It sounds fun if you're
wearing a couple of doughnuts.

Moving on to how.

What you wanna convey...

...is your undying affection and
gratitude for your time spent together...

...coupled with your need for space
to find out who you really are.

- But that's crap.
- It's all crap.

You know it, she knows it,
everybody knows it.

All we're trying to do...

...is keep her from taking batting
practice on your kidneys.

Why would she go for my kidneys?

Because you'll be running away
covering your head.

Okay, okay. So I take her to dinner,
and then before the coffee comes...

...I tell her that
while I have strong feelings for her...

...I need time to find out
who I really am.

Excellent.

Maybe I could throw in some stuff about
how I'm still reeling from my divorce.

Don't improvise.
You don't have the chops for it.

- Sorry.
- No problem.

- I do appreciate the advice.
- You're very welcome.

A mask and a cape,
and the sex was boring?

What can I say?
She still knew it was me.

How do I look?

What difference does it make?
You're breaking up.

I don't want my clothes to say
"come hither."

Don't worry. As always, they say
"your regular teacher is sick."

- Are we clear on everything I told you?
- Yes.

I'm gonna go to her house, pick her up,
take her to the restaurant...

Pick her up?
You're supposed to meet her there.

- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

You're gonna break up with her
and then drive her home?

You'll need the Jaws of Life
to get her out of your car.

- You didn't say anything about that.
- It's common sense.

Do you know why Custer and Sitting Bull
didn't share a pony to Little Bighorn?

They knew
there were gonna be hurt feelings...

...and the ride home
would be awkward.

- I'm just gonna call her and reschedule.
- No, no, no, you're not.

Here's what you do.

You're gonna pick her up,
have a nice dinner...

...drive her home
and walk her to her door.

- What if she asks me in?
- No, never go inside.

Everything in her house
is a potential weapon.

Everything?

I was once blinded for two days
by potpourri.

So you just walk her to her door...

...take her by the hand...

...and tell her
that you've had wonderful times...

...and those are the memories
you will cherish.

You know, we did have
wonderful times.

Hiking in Catalina,
go-carting in Oxnard...

...Oktoberfest in Rosemead.

What a day that was.
Sharing bratwurst and sauerkraut...

...while listening
to the battle of the oompah bands.

Oh, God.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?

No, no, no. The mind plays tricks on us.
It only remembers the good times.

Or in your case,
the creepy, pathetic times.

- But I still...
- Don't worry, Alan.

There'll be other broads
to share your bratwurst with.

You're right, I have to do this.

But wait, what...?
What if she starts crying?

You hold her in your arms, whisper
that this is best for both of you...

...then turn around
and walk away like a man.

Unless you hear a distinct
metallic click, then zigzag and roll.

Hi. Come on in.

That's okay, I'm kind of hungry.
Let's just go.

Well, actually,
I thought we could stay in tonight.

- Really?
- I'm making fondue.

- Come on.
- Oh, goody.

Hot cheese and long, sharp forks.

This movie is stupid.

This movie is a classic.

It's been 40 minutes and we
haven't even seen the shark yet.

That's because they're building suspense,
letting you use your imagination.

You know what I'm imagining?
A better movie.

- It's a classic, Jake.
- I'll tell you what's a classic.

Snakes on a Plane.

First, you're in an airplane,
which is scary to begin with...

...and then it's all filled with snakes.

And they're everywhere.

They're in the overhead compartments,
in the bathrooms, in the vomit bags.

You need to throw up,
open the bag, snake.

Sounds gripping.

Snake.

Snake.

- That's it. We're out of here.
- Where are we going?

Someplace public, where killing you
would get me in trouble.

Fine.

Snake.

- Great fondue, Donna.
- Glad you liked it.

Oh, don't forget
to put away the little forks.

Thanks. Be right back.

Oh, good Lord.

We've had wonderful times together,
Donna.

And those are memories
I will always cherish.

- What?
- Nothing.

The potpourri.

I made coffee.

- Hot coffee?
- Well, yeah.

Of course it's hot.

Oh, my. That is potentially scalding.

- Blow on it, silly.
- Yes, blowing.

You blow too.

So listen, Donna, there's something
we really need to talk about.

- What's that?
- Well, I was wondering.

Are you completely happy
in this relationship?

- Oh, good, then it's not just me.
- What do you mean?

Well, I enjoy spending time with you...

...but, honey, I kind of feel
like we're getting a little stale.

Really? I thought it was going great.

Come on, Alan. Our sex life is pathetic.
We're just going through the motions.

Well, now, hold on.
Those motions are tried and true.

Call it whatever you want.
Tried and true, dull and listless.

I wanna call it tried and true.

All I know is every time we get in bed,
it's the same old thing.

The same old thing?
What about the mask and cape?

It was the same old thing
in a mask and cape.

Please don't take it personally.

Oh, no. How can I possibly
take it personally?

- You're just telling me I'm a lousy lay.
- No, I didn't mean lousy.

I meant uninspired, lackluster,
predictable.

- Okay.
- Tedious, mind-numbing, boring...

All right, that's it.
Come upstairs with me.

I will show you tedious,
mind-numbing and boring.

Oh, God. I'm sorry.

- Hot, hot, hot.
- What can I do?

I don't know, just do something.

How can you say this is boring?

Wait till you try this.
It's the best pizza in town.

- Says who?
- They put a flyer on Mom's windshield.

It said "best pizza in town."

Jake, let me give you
a little culinary advice.

Any restaurant
that advertises on windshields...

...and has a guy dressed as a hoagie
is probably not the best in town.

He wasn't a hoagie, he was a calzone.

- Amazing.
- What?

How can a kid with such
lousy taste in pizza and movies...

...have such good taste in girls?

- She is kind of cute.
- Why don't you go talk to her?

I don't know what to say.

That's never stopped you
from running your mouth before.

- What about her mom?
- Just stick with the daughter for now.

- No, I mean...
- I know what you mean.

Tell you what. I'll be your wingman.

I'll go over
and engage the mom in conversation.

Then after I grease the wheels,
I'll give you a signal.

You saunter over and work your magic.

- Saunter?
- Walk.

Well, then just say walk.
You don't have to make up words.

Wait, what's the signal?

- I don't know, I'll give you a thumbs up.
- That's not much of a signal.

All right, how about I just wave my arms
and say, "Yo, dumb-ass."

Let's go with the thumb.

- Excuse me.
- Yes?

I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but
I'm sitting over there with my nephew...

- Now?
- No, not now.

- Dumb-ass.
- Now?

No.

Anyway, he's taken a bit of a shine
to your daughter...

...and it would mean the world to him
if he could come over and meet her.

That's very sweet,
and I don't wanna seem impolite...

...but this is our one-on-one time.

I understand. You should have that.
We're only talking a couple of minutes.

- Enough time to put a smile on a boy's...
- Now?

No.

Look, I appreciate you coming over,
but I think we'll pass.

Fine. Sorry to bother you.

Real smooth.

Okay, you really gotta
help me out here.

- Sir, I'm having dinner with my daughter.
- And I am here with my nephew.

They'd rather be sitting and talking...

...than hanging out
with a couple of old farts like us.

- What did you call me?
- No, no, no. Not you, us.

I was being funny.

I don't think you're funny at all.

Well, clearly you don't know me.
I'm Charlie.

Yes, well, Charlie,
I've asked you to leave us alone.

- I understand, and I will, but...
- Honey, get me a refill.

Yo, dumb-ass. Go get a refill.

- Now?
- Yes, now.

My brother's kid's not real...

- I warned you.
- God, it's worse than the potpourri.

I see you like the diet cola.

If I may say so,
you don't need to watch your weight.

- Here you go. Clean and dry.
- Thank you, thank you.

- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. Little Alan's fine.

The twins got the worst of it.

Good, good.

Listen, Donna. You were right.

- This relationship is over.
- Over?

Well, what else is there to do
besides call it quits?

Oh, I thought maybe
we could take it to the next level.

Next level?

What's beyond mind-numbing,
tedious and boring?

I'll tell you what's beyond it. Death.

No, thank you. Already been married.

- But, Alan...
- I'm sorry, but it's just...

It's time we faced the truth. L...

I have no romantic feelings
for you anymore.

- None?
- None at all.

Come on, Donna.

Crying doesn't solve anything.
Believe me.

It's better to end this now
while we're still friends.

- Goodbye, my friend.
- Oh, just get out.

- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

- Oh, hi. You must be Alan.
- Yes.

Forget it, Georgia.
It's not gonna happen.

What's not gonna happen?

I thought I could spice up our
relationship with a three-way.

A three-way?

But I didn't realize you had
no romantic feelings for me at all.

Now, hang on.

I think you may have misinterpreted
my remarks.

Oh, honey. I'm here for you.

Now, see, you really need to be
more clear about what you meant...

...by taking it to the next level.

See, I'm fine with this.

- This could help.
- Oh, go to hell.

Was the friend good-Iooking?

Spectacular.

Sounds like you blew what could have
been the best night of your life.

The best night? No, no.
That was the night Jake was born.

You have a three-way
the night Jake was born?

Okay, I blew the best night of my life.

Well, don't worry. You'll have
another opportunity someday.

- How do you figure?
- You may have to wait a few decades.

But I hear the ratio of gals to geezers
in senior-living facilities is two-to-one.

Imagine the progress they'll have made
in boner pills by that time.

Are you staring at me?

Because it feels like
you're staring at me.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Sorry.

I hope I'm not coming down
with something.

You think you might be?

Well, I've been feeling a little congested,
and I think it's settling in my chest.

That's certainly
where I was planning to settle.

Maybe I should go home.

Let's not overreact.

We can still do this.
We just have to be careful.

What do you mean?

Well, we can keep kissing...

...but, you know, Amish-style
with the tongues parked in the barn.

If you need to cough or sneeze,
tap me on the shoulder...

...and I'll cover your face
with a pillow.

And...

- You can use this.
- Nasal spray.

Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

Well, you are gonna need to breathe
through your nose.

- Wanna see a movie today?
- With you?

- Yeah, with me.
- No, thanks.

Okay.

- Wanna do something else?
- Like what?

I don't know. Anything.

Well, can we go
to Les Girls, Girls, Girls?

- What?
- That place near the airport.

Looks real interesting.
I think it's French.

No, no, we're not going
to Les Girls, Girls, Girls.

Then don't say we can do anything.

Okay, forget it.

- You really wanna do something?
- Yes.

How about, drive me to the mall,
so I can see a movie with friends...

...and then you pick me up
when we're done?

And what am I supposed to do?

Well, if I were you,
I'd go to Les Girls, Girls, Girls.

Who's going to Les Girls, Girls, Girls?

- Nobody.
- Too bad.

Daytime's better.

Dancers are a little worse for wear,
but they try harder.

Oh, God, I should have sent
that woman home...

...as soon as I saw
the first snot bubble.

I'm done.

Me too. Get dressed.
I'll drive you to the mall.

Cool.

Will you make me soup before you go?

- I don't have time, Charlie.
- But I'm sick.

- Who's gonna take care of me?
- What do you want me to say?

Maybe if you bothered
to develop a human relationship...

...that involved more than
the thoughtless exchange...

...of bodily fluids, you'd have somebody
to take care of you.

The whole time you were talking,
you could have opened a can of soup.

Morning.

Hey, Berta.

What's wrong with you?

I caught something.

There's a surprise.

Yeah, it's really bad.

Throat, sinuses, stomachaches, chills.

I swear to God,
I feel like I'm gonna die.

Okay.

Well, good luck.

This is it.

I'm a goner.

Hello?

Anybody here?

Anybody gonna take care
of good old Charlie?

Okay, then.

Time to scrape
the bottom of the barrel.

Mommy, I don't feel good.

Oh, Charles, don't tell me you've got
another case of the Bangkok drippy-drip.

No offense.

No, no, it's just a cold or a flu.

And this concerns me how?

Well, I thought maybe you could
come over and make me some soup...

...or put a cool, wet cloth on my head.

Oh, darling, I'd love to.

But, unfortunately, Mommy's sick too.

All right, that does sound bad.

Oh, it is.

What was that?

Oh, just my delirious fever babble.

Bye, dear.

All right. I'm on my own.

Maybe a little fresh air and sunshine.

And nighttime cold medicine.

Fresh air, sunshine,
and nighttime cold medicine.

And Scotch.

Fresh air, sunshine,
nighttime cold medicine...

...and Scotch.

Okay.

Just nighttime cold medicine
and Scotch.

Hey, Charlie.

Rose? I thought you were in England.

I was asked to leave.

A little misunderstanding
at Buckingham Palace.

So how are you?

Not too good. I'm sick.

Poor baby.

Isn't anybody taking care of you?

No. I'm all alone.

Well, that's just not right.

I'll take care of you.

- You will?
- Of course.

Do you want me to make you
some soup?

I would love soup.

I asked everybody to make me soup.
You'd think I was asking for a kidney.

- What are you doing?
- Nighttime cold medicine and Scotch.

I call it the Drunken Hulk.

No, sweetie. I have something better.

I doubt it.

Well, this is new.

Just approved in Europe.

Oh, Europe. Give me.

That's my little man.

Now I'll go and make you that soup.

Thank you.

Okay, Europe, let's see what you got.

That was a great pill.

What was in that pill?
That's a great pill.

Don't you worry about that.

You just get your rest.

You know what else is great?

You showed up exactly
when I needed you the most.

It's like you're my guardian angel.

Hey, you think I can get another one
of those pills?

No, sweetie.

One's enough for now.

Just go to sleep.

Okay.

Good night.

Good night, Charlie.

Can you hear me?

Listen closely to my voice.

You're very, very sick.

I'm very, very sick.

But don't worry.

Rose is gonna take care of you.

Rose is gonna take care of me.

Till death do us part.

I'm gonna need another pill.

Wouldn't kill you to thank me
for dropping you off and picking you up.

Thank you for dropping me off
and picking me up.

- Jake, Jake, wait.
- What?

Okay, listen, I know
you're getting to that age where you'd...

...rather be with your friends
than your old man, and that's okay.

It's completely normal for you
to wanna take your first steps...

...to manhood on your own.

I applaud that.

But I just hope that, while you're
on this path, that every now and then...

...you'll make an effort
to carve out a little Dad time.

Well, that was humiliating.

Charlie?

How are you feeling?

- Rose?
- Hi, Alan.

- What are you doing here?
- Taking care of Charlie.

I'm very, very sick.

Go for it.

So how long are you back in town?

As long as Charlie needs me.

Well, don't let that big baby
take advantage of your good nature.

Don't worry, Berta.
I'm fine taking care of him.

Well, that's good,
because nobody else wants to.

The truth is, I just love feeding him,
cleaning him, changing him.

- You're changing him?
- Cleaning him?

You know, if you stop feeding him,
you won't have to change him.

I don't mind. I'm a loving nurturer.

Uncle Charlie says
you're a crazy stalker.

Potato, potato.

Hey, Rose,
you wanna go see a movie later?

Maybe. We'll see
how your uncle's feeling.

He's very, very sick.

So, basically,
what we're saying here is...

...you'll go to the movies
with anybody but me.

Not anybody.

I wouldn't go with Hitler.

Charlie?

I'm in here.

What are you doing out of bed?

What do you think?

Let me help you.

Yeah, Rose, I got this.

Just relax, sweetie.

I said I got it.

Let go.

You're sick.
You shouldn't be lifting anything.

All right. I'm done.

Need a shake?

No, thanks.

Okey-dokey.

Now let's get you back into bed.

Rose, I appreciate you taking care of me,
but I'm thinking the worst is over.

That's your mind playing tricks on you.

If you start running around too soon,
you'll relapse.

- Maybe get pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?

Lungs fill up with fluid.
You can't breathe.

And you end up drowning
in your own mucus.

You don't want that, do you?

I don't wanna drown
in anybody's mucus.

Of course, you don't.

Open.

Good boy.

I am really lucky to have you, Rose.

You know what, Charlie?

I think we make our own luck.

- We do?
- Well...

I do.

Rose?

Hello?

Anybody there?

What the hell?

Oh, that's not right.

Alan. Alan.

Alan!

What's the matter?

How long have I been up here?

- I don't know. About two weeks?
- Two weeks?

Didn't you think to check on me?

Well, frankly, everything was going
so smoothly around here.

It never occurred to me.

- Are those knit booties?
- What?

- I don't know.
- Since when do you wear knit booties?

Since when do I have
turquoise fingernails?

- Where's Rose?
- She went to the movies with Jake.

God forbid my son
should go anywhere with his father.

- I mean, I have tried everything...
- Alan, listen to me.

- You cannot let Rose back in this house.
- Why not?

The cold pills she's been giving me
are not cold pills.

- What do you think they are?
- I don't know.

Something you give to elephants
when they can't sleep.

- Elephants?
- European elephants.

You know,
I think you might be delirious.

- You really should lie down.
- Screw that.

I'm getting out
before she comes back.

Are those comfy?
Because they look really comfy.

Charlie.

What are you doing up?

Stay away from me, Rose.

- What's wrong, honey?
- Don't you call me honey.

Charlie, Charlie,
you need to calm down.

Calm down?

Thanks to her, I've been
a drooling vegetable for weeks.

I was afraid of this.
He's running a very high fever.

- He's hallucinating.
- I am not running a fever. Here, feel me.

I am not hot.

A little clammy and none too fresh,
but not hot.

Just relax, baby. You need your rest.

No, no, no, what I need is a lawyer.

Alan, please, you gotta believe me.
I am not sick.

I believe you. Now, lay down.

- But, Alan...
- It's for your own good.

Okay. Okay, you're right.

I'm crazy from the fever.

Not crazy, honey.

Just very, very sick.

Now, open up.

Good boy. Swallow.

There you go. Now, get some rest.

So does a guy have to be sick
to get a pair of those booties?

Thank God
she wasn't using suppositories.

Son of a bitch.

Charlie, are you up?

Alan.

- What are you doing?
- Escaping.

Charlie, this isn't a good time.

I've already had
my second cup of coffee.

Look, I don't know how long I've got.

Neither do I.

Oh, damn it. She's out.

- Out of what?
- Her freaking mind.

Charlie, where are you?

Oh, God, she's coming.
Is your door locked?

No. Neither was my window.

Two mistakes I will never make again.

Charlie, are you in here?

- Rose.
- Sorry, Alan. Have you seen Charlie?

Bathtub.

For God's sake, Alan,
you're my brother.

Oh, Charlie, is this how you act
after everything I've done for you?

Yes. This is how I act.

Playing Anne Frank in the bathtub.

Well, I give up. I can't take care of you
if you won't cooperate.

Oh, no, no, Rose. Let's not be hasty.

It's been so nice
these last couple of weeks.

What if Charlie promises
to behave himself?

I am not promising
Nurse Ratched anything.

Well, then I guess I'll just leave.

- You're not leaving.
- I was bluffing.

- Rose.
- Darn.

I hope you are proud of yourself.
All she was trying to do was help.

No, no, no,
that's not what she was trying to do.

This was all a plot.

It started with getting me sick.

She drugged me to keep me helpless
so she could move in...

...and have her way with me.
- Oh, really? Rose got you sick.

Nothing to do with sticking your tongue
down the throat of a flu-riddled bimbo?

I'm not saying I know how she did it,
but she did it.

Any idea how insane
this makes you sound?

I have proof. Come on, I'll show you.

Charlie?

Fine. I'll wait outside.

I'm bored. Wanna go see a movie?

- Now?
- Well, you got the listings there.

Jake, for the love of God.

Fine. But don't say I never ask.

You'll see. I have proof.

I didn't swallow the last pill,
so we can have it analyzed.

Right. I'll call CSI
and have them run some tests.

I hid it under my pillow and...

Okay, I don't have proof.

Rose?

Oh, hi, Lulu.

- How'd your plan work out?
- Well, you were fine.

But I think I may have overplayed it.

If you wanna take another swing at him,
I'm coming down with mono.

Oh, Charlie's already had mono.

Give me a call if you get mumps
or whooping cough.

Will do.

Oh, Rose.

Oh, God, not another one.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Not only did that movie suck,
it blew chunks, bit the big one...

...and then came back
and sucked again.

- Did you pay for it?
- Yeah.

With an hour and a half of my childhood
that I'll never get back.

Hey, I've seen your childhood.
It's not a big loss.

- You said you wanted to see it.
- It was rated R.

But there wasn't a single boob in it.

- You were there.
- Oh, my God.

I know, and he talks to me that way
all the time.

That's Cynthia Sullivan.

Who is Cynthia Sullivan?

- She and her husband used to be friends.
- Yeah, so?

I haven't seen her
since Judith and I split.

I don't know if I should say hello.
They took Judith's side in the divorce.

Wait a minute.
We're allowed to take sides?

Nobody told me. Is it too late?

That's not funny, Charlie.

He's very hurtful to everybody,
and for no reason.

Alan?

Oh, hey, Cynthia.

- Hi.
- Wow, what a nice surprise.

- How are you?
- Just great.

It's been a long time.

Hi, Jake. Look how big you're getting.

It's called puberty.

It's called doughnuts.

Doughnuts don't make hair.

Cynthia, this is my brother, Charlie.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Cynthia and her husband
were friends with me...

...back when we were,
you know, me and Judith.

- And when we were me and Bill.
- You're not with Bill anymore?

No. We decided to finally stop
kidding ourselves.

- You know how it is.
- I do.

No, you don't.

Of course I do.

- Did you get the house in the divorce?
- Yes.

Not sleeping
on your brother's Hide-A-Bed?

- No.
- You don't know how it is.

Again, completely unmotivated.

Well, okay. It was really nice
to see you again, Alan.

- We should get together sometime.
- Yeah, that would be nice.

Nice meeting you. Bye, Jake.

- You dog.
- What?

Oh, come on, the full-frontal hug,
the "let's get together."

Isn't that like soccer mom talk
for "Do me in the cul-de-sac"?

- What are you snickering at?
- Oh, tell me that's not dirty.

Go get us a table. Come on.
Charlie, you don't understand.

She and her husband
were our best friends for like 10 years.

We traveled together.
We spent vacations together.

And you never fantasized
about boinking her?

She was Judith's friend.
I was her husband's friend.

Of course I did.

Yeah, hi. Two regular coffees, please.

And one chocolate crappuccino
with whipped cream and sprinkles.

Well, here's your chance
to fulfill your fantasy.

- Oh, no, no, I couldn't.
- Why not?

I don't wanna upset Judith.
They're still friends.

Alan, the fact that you're still
drawing breath upsets Judith.

I couldn't go out with Cynthia
without clearing it with her.

I am not whipped.
What if the positions were reversed?

Like Judith was single
and wanted to date you?

I would certainly want her to check
with me before I, you know...

...blew my brains out.

Is that all it would take?
What's her number?

- Where did you get that?
- I found it on the table.

Oh, Jake.

It's okay. I'm eating on the side
without teeth marks.

Puberty, my ass.
That's a missing chromosome.

No, I'm pretty sure it's a bear claw.

- Hey, honey, how was...?
- Not now. I gotta go to the bathroom.

Please tell me
you didn't let him eat a lot of crap.

Let him? Judith, our son is a billy goat.

I wouldn't be surprised
if he's in there pooping out tin cans.

- Lovely.
- Oh, wait, Judith.

- I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

Well, we were just having coffee,
and I happened to run into...

Charlie, can you give us a minute?

No, I wanna watch this.

- Why?
- I think it might amuse me.

Yeah, well,
seek amusement elsewhere.

Fine. I'll go talk to Herb.

Of all Judith's husbands,
he's my favorite anyway.

You know, Jake's right. Sometimes
you can be hurtful for no reason at all.

So who did you run into?

- Oh, Cynthia Sullivan.
- Okay. So?

Well, I know you're still friends,
and I was wondering...

...if you'd be okay if I asked her out.

- Fine.
- Really?

Sure. You're both adults.
You're both single...

...and, most importantly,
she won't go out with you.

- How do you know?
- I know.

Has she said something to you?

No, but you're not her type.

- Oh, really? What is her type?
- Well, like her ex-husband.

Smart, funny, sensitive, good-Iooking.

- And that's not me?
- No, no. You can be funny.

Okay, okay. But if she did agree
to go out with me...

...you'd be okay with that?
- But she won't.

- But if she did? She might.
- She won't. She won't.

You know, Charlie's not the only one
who can be hurtful for no reason.

You know, Herb,
that is a fine, fine hat.

Gotta wear it.
Otherwise, I freckle like a banana.

Well, I wouldn't want your banana
to get freckled.

- Let's go, Charlie.
- Hang on, hang on.

We're having a real interesting
conversation here.

Hey, Herb, tell Alan what you told me
about how you plant seeds.

Well, first I make sure
the soil is moist.

And tell him how you do that.

Well, I just stick my finger
into old mother earth.

If it comes up dry, I just whip out
my hose and give it a good spritz.

And then?

And then I carefully plant the seed
in the soil.

Carefully? Why carefully?

Because if you just fling
that stuff around, half of it's wasted.

You hear that, Alan? If you fling
your seed around, it gets wasted.

- Fascinating. Let's go.
- Now hold on, hold on.

How do you feel about bushes, Herb?

Well, I like a full bush.

The way God intended.

I like them trimmed.

- What about you, Alan?
- We're going. Bye, Herb.

Bye, fellas.

- Why do you do that to him?
- It amuses me.

Oh, oh, great.
So I will pick you up tonight at 7.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm really looking forward to it.

Okay, okay. Bye.

Yes.

Judith said Cynthia wouldn't go out
with me, and she was wrong, so:

- Look, I told you she'd go out with you.
- And you were right, sir.

I ignore you at my own peril...

...when it comes
to women, liquor and venereal disease.

Then listen to me now.

Be prepared for sex tonight.

Sex? It's a first date.

Not really. You and Cynthia
are old friends. You know each other.

You like each other.
You might as well smell like each other.

- No, I don't think so. Not Cynthia.
- Not Cynthia?

Alan, the woman's pushing 40.
She's coming off a divorce.

And praying that her looks hold out
so she can snag some loser...

...she wouldn't have been
caught dead with five years ago.

Oh, boy, I'm getting laid tonight.

- I'm saying.
- I wish I could rub Judith's nose in this.

That would be a huge:

Don't worry. Judith will find out.

- Are you gonna tell her?
- No.

Would you?

Alan, Cynthia will tell her.

- Oh, right, right, they're friends.
- More importantly, they're women.

You know how they are:

They tell each other everything.

Trust me, it'll be like Judith is watching
every move you make tonight.

Every move?

- So bring your A game.
- Right, right.

What if I don't have an A game?

You better find one, because you don't
wanna get yanked off the mound.

- Where you going?
- To warm up the old pitching arm.

- I'm using a metaphor.
- So am I.

Oh, Alan, I have fantasized about this
for so long.

Me too. Ever since
we all went to Disney World...

...and you wore that white T-shirt
on Splash Mountain.

Are you sure this isn't going too fast?

Not a chance.
I've been warming up all afternoon.

Oh, real smooth, Alan.

Go, ahead. I'm just gonna sit here
and watch every move you make.

Oh, Alan, that was remarkable.

Remarkable good, right?

Oh, yeah.

I have to admit, I was a little worried
that this might be awkward.

How come?

Well, I mean, you know,
I am friends with Judith.

- We do talk.
- No kidding.

Well, the next time you talk,
be sure to use the word "remarkable."

Oh, Alan, look, I'm not like that.
I mean, I believe in discretion.

Really? I think it's overrated.

- Go ahead. Tell her.
- No.

I wish
Judith had a little more discretion.

What do you mean?

Well, she just goes on and on
about her sex life with Herb.

Big Bird's pretty boring, huh?

No. I mean, the way she tells it,
he is an amazing lover.

Yeah, that's what I thought... Wait.

Wait, wait.
Herb Melnick is an amazing lover?

Yeah. She said he was the best
that she's ever had.

No. No.

That can't possibly be right.

How can that be?

Well, apparently, he's just...

No, I can't go into that.

Sure, you can. Go ahead.

No. You know, it wouldn't be right.

I'm sorry. Just forget I said anything.

Best she's ever had.

Oh, Herb,
you're the best I've ever had.

- Morning.
- Morning.

So how'd it go last night?

You were right. We had sex.

Then why the long face, Seabiscuit?

You're so much better than
the only other man I've ever been with.

I've just got something on my mind.

Like what?

I had no idea what I was missing.

Forget it.

- Oh, come on. What's bothering you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

Oh, come on.

Come on, what?

In what universe is Herb Melnick
a better lover than me?

Herb Melnick?

I thought you had sex with Cynthia
last night.

I did, but you know what she told me?

That Judith told her that Herb
was the best lover she's ever had.

How does that come up
while you're boffing Cynthia?

- What difference does it make?
- I'm just trying to picture the context.

"Oh, Cynthia,
I am so turned on right now.

I wonder how Herb does it to Judith."

No, it wasn't like that.

Okay, was it like,
"Golly, you have firm buttocks.

You know who else has a nice ass?
Herb Melnick"?

I didn't bring up the subject
of Herb's sexual prowess. Cynthia did.

Oh, that's never a good sign.

Fifteen years Judith and I were together.
Twelve years of marriage...

...and the best sex we ever had
was mediocre.

If you were having bad sex,
why did you marry her?

What kind of stupid question is that?
I told you, we were having sex.

But she never enjoyed it.
Certainly never sought it out.

Then Herb Melnick comes along
with his tousled hair and goofy charm...

...and lights her up
like an all-night liquor store.

So you're saying
Farmer Herb's tilling soil...

...you couldn't even get your hoe into.

- My hoe?
- Yeah. You know, with an E? Hoe.

- Fine, yes.
- And it's bothering you to know...

...that night after night
he's planting a tree in Israel.

By Israel, I mean, Judith.

- Yes.
- And by tree, I mean...

I know what you mean. Okay, I get it.
God, why do you do this to me?

Haven't I made that clear?
It amuses me.

It's driving me nuts. I mean,
what's his secret? How does he do it?

Maybe he's got a big trouser monkey.

- You been listening this whole time?
- Wouldn't you?

You think she's right?
You think he's just well-endowed?

He could be.
He's, what, 6" 4', got big hands.

If everything is proportional...

...I'm guessing
he could ring doorbells with that thing.

- You're not helping.
- I rarely do.

Oh, Alan, you're looking at this
the wrong way.

What do you mean?

Well, you're seeing your ex-wife
as half-empty.

- But with Herb in the picture...
- Shut up.

Oh, get a room.

- Oh, Alan.
- Oh, Cynthia.

Oh, Herb.

Hey, buddy.

- Okay, okay, I can't do this.
- Oh, well, what's the matter?

I gotta know. What makes Herb
the best Judith's had?

I thought we settled this.

Yeah, but it's driving me crazy.
Is it just physical endowment?

What?

You know, can he put a hat on it
and drive in the carpool lane?

I am not gonna repeat
what a friend said to me in confidence.

Don't give me that. You're a woman.
That's all you guys do:

You know what I think?
I think that you're still not over Judith.

Oh, please. I don't care about Judith.

I can't
wrap my head around Herb's penis.

Okay. I just realized
why your marriage ended.

- Why?
- Something is very wrong with you.

Oh, that.

I think you should go home.

- But you said I was remarkable.
- Get out.

Fine.

Okay. I'll see you guys at home.

- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

- Here to pick up Jake?
- Yeah.

- Another weekend with the boy.
- Gonna take him to the movies.

Oh, okay.

- Well, he's waiting for you.
- Great, great.

Yeah, come on, Alan.

- I didn't see anything. Did you?
- Nothing jumped out at me.

I just don't get it. What is his secret?

- Maybe he doesn't have a secret.
- What do you mean?

I mean, you didn't set the bar too high
to begin with.

It's like Judith spent 15 years living
on peanut butter and jelly.

If someone comes along
and offers bologna...

...she's gonna think
it's a steak sandwich.

Jake, your father's here.

So I'm sorry to hear
about you and Cynthia.

- She told you.
- Of course she told me. We're friends.

Did she happen to mention the word
"remarkable"?

No, but she did say
she didn't think you were over me.

- Oh, he's over you. Right, Alan?
- Right.

But what's the deal with Herb's junk?

- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy, let's go. Bye, Judith.

- Real subtle.
- Sometimes you just gotta ask.

- See you on Sunday, Herb.
- Okay, have a good weekend.

Wow, look at him go.

Okay, mystery solved.

Good for you. Never too late to learn.

.......... ********** ..........

Taste this.

I don't need to taste it.
It's a chocolate laxative.

I think it needs more caramel.

I'm telling you, Alan.

One of these days, that kid's gonna fart
and birds are gonna fall out of the sky.

Funny. Listen, how much is a hooker?

What? Alan, what are you gonna do
with a hooker?

Well, I'd like to pay her
to have sex with me.

- I get it, but why?
- Well, I've been thinking.

I don't have a great track record
with relationships...

...but I still have desires.

So I figure, why not simplify?

Get back to basics.

No relationship,
no disappointment, just sex.

Well, sex with you...

...there's bound to be
some disappointment.

I mean, even with a hooker,
money only buys you so much goodwill.

But I don't have to care. Because it's
a straight business transaction...

...the only needs that are important
are mine.

Hey, you don't have to sell me on it.

I just never pictured you
doing anything like this.

Me neither.
You know what's interesting?

Once I decided to give up trying
to live a moral life, I felt somehow free.

Again, you don't have to sell me on it.
How much are you looking to spend?

Well, as you know,
I am a bit of a bargain hunter.

But unfortunately, they don't stock
hookers at the 99-cent store.

- Give me a number.
- Okay, well...

...what could I get
in the 200-dollar range?

Crabs.

And carjacked.

All right, then.
Why don't you give me a number?

- Fifteen hundred dollars.
- For one night?

For one hour.

One hour?
I want sex, not surround sound.

Trust me, it's worth it.

For that kind of money,
you get the girlfriend experience.

Haven't you been listening?
I don't want the girlfriend experience.

I want sex.

Guiltless, emotionless, selfish sex.

- I understand.
- At a reasonable price.

Got it. I'll make a few calls,
see what I can do.

That'd be good.
And try to get a non-smoker.

Sure.

Who wants a girl who would put
one of those nasty things in her mouth?

Charlie?

Charlie Harper?

Hey, how are you?

Wow, how long has it been?

Too long. This is my brother, Alan.

Hi. This is my daughter, Milly.

- Hi, Milly.
- Hello, Milly.

Boy, this is some killer crumb cake.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Milly, this is my son, Jake.
Jake, this is Milly.

Want some cake?

I don't eat sugar.

Oh, yeah, me neither.

Unless it's in, like, pies
and cookies and stuff.

- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

I play guitar. I'm in a band.

They're called the Dudes of Rockage.
Heavy metal, classic rock kind of stuff.

- I'm into Gwen Stefani.
- Oh, yeah, they're great.

- Sure you don't want some cake?
- No, thanks.

Oh, gee, we have to get going.

Call me sometime. Maybe we can get
together, have dinner, catch up.

Oh, that'd be great.

You still have my number?

I'm sure I do, but, you know,
just in case.

Here you go.

- Pleasure to meet you, Alan.
- Same here.

She seems nice. Who is she?

I have no frigging idea.

I'll tell you who she is.

The grandmother of my children.

- Uncle Charlie?
- What?

Could you do me a favor and call
Milly's mom, find out if Milly likes me?

But don't tell her I asked,
because I don't wanna appear needy.

I'm on it.

You're not gonna do it, are you?

What was your first clue?

Oh, come on, why not?

Jake, buddy, I don't even remember
who Milly's mom is.

Calling her would put me
in a very awkward position.

More than the time I had to pretend
to be lost at the mall...

...so you could meet the cute guard?
- Hey, we both benefited from that.

- How do you figure?
- I got a hot date. You got a hot pretzel.

It was an excellent pretzel.

Did you make the call?

Jeez, everybody wants me
to pimp for them.

Might as well get myself an orange hat,
platform shoes and a full-length fur coat.

If anybody could pull it off,
it'd be you.

Did you make the call?

Here. Her name's Alexis.

She's expecting to hear from you.

Alexis, that's a pretty name.

They all have pretty names, Alan.

You'll never meet a hooker
named Maude.

Right, right. So exactly how much
are we talking about?

She's willing to throw you one
for 500.

Okay.

Can I put it on a credit card?

A credit card?

Where are you planning
to swipe it, Alan?

All right, all right,
I was just hoping to get the miles.

Forget the miles.

And remember,
that 500 does not include the tip.

I have to tip her?

You know, in case there's something you
want that might be considered unusual.

Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to tip her.

- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Berta.

Hey, Berta.

So, what you're saying
is that this is a à-la-carte kind of deal.

Like a steakhouse?

What?

As opposed to a set menu
or buffet style.

Sure, whatever.

Should I mention your name
when I call?

Absolutely.

For every referral,
I get a free travel mug.

Okay, terrific. Thank you, Charlie.

Happy to help.

Zippy getting a hooker?

- It would appear so.
- Boy, talk about earning your money.

Look, all you gotta do is call her mother,
talk to her, then ask if Milly's there.

And if she is, you hand me the phone.

- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- Did you get a look at her?

Jake, buddy, I don't even know
her mother's name.

So? You don't know the name
of half the girls you bring over.

First month I was here,
you called me Jack.

All right, all right.

I will call her, dance around the fact
that I have no idea who the hell she is...

...then hand you the phone.

- Great.
- As long as you're hooking people...

Forget it.

Oh, come on, I'm not picky.

Just find me a young Andy Griffith.

Just remember, I'm doing you a favor.

Don't forget it in a few years
when I ask you to change my diaper.

Okay.

Wait, what?

Hey, hi, it's Charlie.

Yeah, it was great to see you too.

Listen, let me tell you why I'm calling.

I'm sitting here with my nephew...

Yeah, he does like his cake.

Remind her I'm in a band.

Hang on.

- You gonna let me do this?
- You're rambling.

Fine. It's all yours.

Hello, is Milly there?

Oh, okay, well, can you tell her
that Jake Harper called?

The kid with the band?

Really? Sure, I guess so.

Okay, thanks. Bye.

You and me are having dinner with them
on Friday, so you can catch up.

You and me?

Just don't clock block me, okay?

- Clock block you?
- That's not it?

No, that's not it.

Jake, let's go.

- How do I look?
- Like you should be knocking on doors...

...asking people
if they've heard the good news.

I already told all my friends
I have a date.

Wasn't gonna wear the jacket.
The shirt has mustard on the back.

How did you get mustard
on the back of your shirt?

A kid bet me I couldn't catch a hot dog
behind my back.

Turns out I couldn't.

Is that what you're wearing?

- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing. It's fine.

No, no, no, please, Mr. Blackwell,
I want your opinion.

Would it kill you to tuck your shirt in?

I would, but I just sat
in some Thousand Island dressing.

Been there, done that.

All right. Get in the car.

Alan, we're leaving.

Okay, have fun.

I'm going on a double date
with pumpkin head.

Fun's not an option.

Well, whatever.
I know it means a lot to him.

That's good, because his happiness
is everything to me.

Oh, Charlie, wait.

- Yeah?
- Guess who's coming over tonight.

Alexis.

Oh, good for you.

But if you're planning
to use that vegetable oil...

...it's probably gonna run you
an extra hundred.

I'm making French fries.

You know, carb-Ioading
for my upcoming 60-minute dash.

My mistake.

But I like how you think.
Kinky and heart-smart.

- Right.
- Wait, wait, wait, one more thing.

- Is this like parking at the mall?
- What?

If I go over five minutes,
do I have to pay for a whole other hour?

No, it's like a tollbooth.

At the end of the hour, a gate
comes down and lops off your penis.

Have fun.

Do me a favor.

If you get a chance,
ask Milly what her mother's name is.

Why don't you ask her?

Because women don't like it
when you forget their names.

Well, then why do you always do it?

Why do you always eat pastrami
when you know it gives you gas?

Because I love pastrami.

Well, there you go.

But I always know it's called pastrami.

- Just ask her.
- Okay.

Now, let's talk about your date.

- You need to get your ducks in a row.
- What do you mean?

If this little girl is important to you,
it'd behoove you to have a plan.

Behoove?

It would benefit you.

Oh, yeah, sure.

What was that thing about ducks?

It's just an expression.

- Well, it's confusing.
- Sorry.

You can't get them in a row.

I know, I know, now just listen to me.

- They're ducks.
- Right.

They move willy-nilly.

Shut up.

It would behoove you
to speak nicer to me.

I swear to God, I will open the sunroof,
pick you up with one hand...

...and toss you into the carpool lane.

You know, there's no reason
we couldn't be in the carpool lane.

All right, all right, I'm listening.

Thank you.

Now, three rules.

Number one, dinner with
a beautiful woman is never about food.

- I know, it's about making her like me.
- Very good.

- But there will be food, right?
- Yes.

Because I'm not at my best
when I'm hungry.

Jake, you need to focus here.

It would behoove me to focus.

Sorry, what are the other two rules?

Number two,
eat with your mouth closed.

Number three,
pray she has low self-esteem.

Number three isn't a rule.

For you, it is.

Fine. Now, let's go over
my three rules.

You've got rules?

Number one, I'd like you not to call me
Mr. Potato Head...

...or SpongeBob SmearPants.

How about Sir Farts a Lot?

No.

Number two, I think it'd be better...

...if I call you Charlie
rather than Uncle Charlie.

Because that way,
we'd be more like equals.

So if we're equal, does that mean
you're gonna split the check with me?

I knew you'd say that, Charlie.

And number three?

Oh, there's only two. I miscounted.

Roxanne, you don 't have to
Put on the red light

Those days are over

You don 't have to
Sell your body to the night

Oh, wait, you do.

Here we go.

Make me proud.

Hey, Alan.

Rose?

Oh, for God's sake,
did Charlie put you up to this?

What? Charlie didn't put me up
to anything.

Right, so it's just a coincidence
I'm waiting for a prostitute...

...and you show up at the front door.

You're waiting for a prostitute?

No.

Oh, Alan, that's not like you.

When you've had
your heart broken enough times...

...and you can't bear having
an emotional connection...

...with another human,
what else is there?

A lot of people masturbate, I hear.

Really, I've heard them.

Nevertheless, sometimes a man needs
to feel something...

...other than his own touch.

Have you tried switching hands?

It's like being with a clumsy stranger.

Hi.

Hi, you must be Alan's prostitute.
I'm Rose.

Hi, Rose.
Will you be joining us tonight?

No, you'll just be doing Alan
this evening.

Good night, Rose.

Good night.

So come on in.

Sorry I'm a little late.

Oh, that's okay.

As long as it doesn't come out of my,
you know, winky-dink time.

Charlie, you haven't changed a bit
in all these years.

It has been years, hasn't it?
How many years do you think it's been?

I don't know, probably 12.

- And how old are you, honey?
- Fourteen.

Thank heaven.

For little girls.

- So, Milly, do you play dodge ball?
- No.

I enjoy it quite a bit
because it's just man against man...

...but with big red balls.

- Lx-nay on the alls-bay.
- What?

Just don't say balls.

So are you living in the same place?

Yeah, still in my condo.

Right, the condo.

Boy, that takes me back.

- I don't think you were ever there.
- That's what I meant.

Takes me back to not being there.

The thing about dodge...

...round things is the thrill of competition
and the deep satisfaction you get...

...when you see a kid's retainer
fly out of his mouth...

...when he takes one to the face.
- I hate dodge ball. It's too violent.

You're right. It sucks.

Milly enjoys
painting and writing poetry.

You know, like me.

Of course I know.
How could I not know?

- Are you still doing the whole art thing?
- What do you mean?

I mean, that thing you used to do
with the art.

And the poetry.

Milly, did Jake tell you
he was in a band?

Yeah, I'm in a band.

I don't think she has low self-esteem.

Shall we take care of business
before we get started?

Oh, absolutely. No money, no honey.

No looty, no booty.

No cash advance,
I'm not in your pants.

- That was 400, right?
- Five.

Oh, of course.

Why do I think it was four?

Thanks. So, Alan, what do you like?

Oh, just about anything.
I'm not finicky.

No limits, huh?

Well, you know, I'm not into animals
or anything near my keister.

Okay, come here.

Let's get comfy.

Oh, alrighty.

Baby, you really turn me on.

- Hang on a sec.
- What?

I'm a little bumped
by that "turn me on" part.

I wanna believe you,
but I've been with enough women...

...to know that it doesn't happen
that fast.

Sometimes it doesn't happen at all.

Honey, I would not lie to you.

No, no, of course not.
Why would you lie to me?

But I'm just saying it would help...

...if you could tone down the narration
to a more believable level.

- All right.
- Okay.

You are the best kisser.

- Okay, again.
- What?

I happen to know for a fact
that I'm not the best kisser.

Okay, I'm a little confused here.

I'm just not buying it.

And since I am buying it,
I should be able to buy it.

All you have to do is tell the truth.
There's no need for hyperbole.

- All right, okay.
- Okay.

Oh, Alan, your lips are so...

...thin and dry.

Okay, now we're cooking.

I think competitive eating
really changed...

...when that Japanese guy
started wetting the hot-dog buns.

I actually figured out that trick myself.

By accident.

So how are your folks doing?

That's not funny, Charlie.

You know, I meant,
how are they doing in heaven?

- What are you talking about?
- Hell?

Are you referring to their divorce?

Yes, I am, and divorce is hell.
But after a while, it can be like heaven.

You know, you're even prettier
than I remember.

Thank you. And you are just as charming
as the first time we met.

- Oh, you don't remember that.
- I sure do.

- It was a really hot day in July...
- Hot dog eaters are amateurs.

The guys that do pork ribs and spaghetti,
they're the real athletes.

Hey, hey, hey, the lady's talking here.

Oh, right. Milly, Charlie wants to know
what your mom's name is.

You don't remember my name?

What? Of course I do.

You're gonna listen
to SpongeBob SmearPants?

Oh, you wanna play like that, huh,
Mr. Drunky Face.

- What's my name, Charlie?
- Just a sec.

How's your lobster?
Do you need more butter?

Because there's plenty on Jake's shirt.

You have no idea
what my name is, do you?

He doesn't have a clue.

Okay, okay, okay,
I'm not good with names.

But I'll never forget the passionate nights
we spent together.

- We never spent the night together.
- We didn't?

- No.
- Well, no wonder I don't remember you.

Come on, honey, we're leaving.

No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

I gotta know.

Who the hell are you?

- Nice going.
- Me?

- You're putting this on me?
- Can I bring you anything else?

Yeah, get me a bottle of Scotch,
a taxi and a smarter kid.

Can I have
a chocolate mousse, please?

Oh, come on, I just said I can't believe
I'm the biggest you've ever seen.

I mean, I'm not even the biggest
I've ever seen.

- And I haven't seen that many.
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

- Why?
- I have a headache.

I can work with that.
I was married for 12 years.

Here's your money.
Don't ever call me again.

Okay, second base for free.

So are either of you gonna tell me
how it went tonight?

Ask your bubble-headed son.

Ask your butt-headed brother.

You know what?

I'm not that interested.

I'm going to bed.

Oh, no, stay.

I so enjoy your company.

So how'd it go with Alexis?

Well, I don't wanna brag,
but she wouldn't take my money.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

- Alan, I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

- Alone.
- Gotta be about sex.

Take a hike.

I'm 14.
You're not protecting me anymore.

- Jake.
- This is just a pathetic sham.

- So, what's up?
- Okay, long story short.

- I've got a young woman upstairs.
- Wow, I didn't see this one coming.

See her?
I'm surprised you couldn't hear her.

She was like a cat in a fan belt.

Anyway, I need you to entertain her
in my absence.

Entertain her?
What did you have in mind?

A musical number
from Sweeney Todd?

How young is she?
Maybe a little peekaboo.

Right there.
That's why no one likes you.

Just keep her occupied till I get back.

- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

A date? It's 8:30 in the morning.

I know what time it is. I have
a limited window of opportunity here.

Her husband's playing nine holes,
so I thought...

...I'd try and play a couple myself.

Then why don't you
just send the other girl home?

I'll be back by noon. What am I
supposed to do the rest of the day?

Okay, okay.

I'm gonna say something now, because,
well, I think it needs to be said.

- What?
- You're a severely damaged human being.

Hey, I'd love to stay
and chitchat with you...

...but I've got a golf widow
marinating in Brentwood.

Wait, wait. What am I
supposed to tell the girl upstairs?

I don't know.
Tell her I went out to give blood.

That way, if I come back a little weak,
I've got a good excuse.

So you want me to just lie to her?

It's up to you.
You could tell her the truth.

But then you'd have to pack up all your
crap and move into the lifeguard station.

Why do you gotta do that?

Why is it always
"my way or the highway"?

"Obey my commands or you're out."

Then again, if the system works,
why mess with it?

Boy, they left the faucet on a long time
when they poured those legs.

I don't believe it. Another one.

Oh, hey, Alan.

- Who's the blond?
- Don't know.

Found her on the beach.

Like homeless?

Not tonight.

You realize that's three in one day.

Depends how you count.
I make it out to be seven.

Or eight.

I should carry a clicker.

Oh, Charlie, even for you,
this is ridiculous.

Hey, one man's ridiculous
is another man's "yabba dabba doo."

"I should carry a clicker."

By the way, I'm Charlie.

- I'm Gretchen.
- I like that. Gretchen.

It's got a built-in:

Upstairs on the right.

- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

- Charlie Harper?
- Yeah?

Keep your hands off my wife.

Yes, sir. No problem.

God, Charlie, are you okay?

No, I'm not okay.
I just got punched in the face.

Help me up.

That was an angry husband, wasn't it?

Well, you can't really blame him.

From now on, he's gonna have to
take his wife golfing with him.

Wait a second.
You're still going upstairs?

Why not? It wasn't her husband.

But you're bleeding.

Did you see that girl?

I'd be climbing these stairs
if I was just a head and a spine.

Berta, have you noticed anything
different about Charlie lately?

- What did you mean?
- Well, he's always been promiscuous...

...but I'm starting to think
I should hide my bowling ball.

I know what you're saying.

I'm having to change
his sheets so often...

...I'm thinking about
putting them on a roller.

Have you seen him
act this way before?

Well, when Viagra first came out,
I thought he was gonna die.

Know how they say if your erection
lasts for more than four hours...

...you should call your doctor?

He'd just call another girl.

For a while there, he had to
stand on his head to take a leak.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Rough night in Hump Junction?

No, it was good.

I just had a little accident.

I tried to pick my lady friend up
and put her on the bureau...

...and now
I can't find one of my testicles.

Oh, Charlie.

I don't think I really lost it.

It's kind of like your keys.

Even if you can't
put your hands on them...

...you know they gotta
be somewhere.

That is something you do not
wanna find in the vacuum bag.

You know,
I'm really starting to worry about him.

I feel like I should do something.

The way he's been acting,
if I were you...

...I'd start sleeping on my back
wearing a catcher's mask.

Good news. I found it.

It's always the last place you look.

- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm fine.

Just a little tender in the giblets.

Yeah, you're fine.

Two beers, please.

Oh, yeah, much better.

- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

Scouting the talent.

Are you out of your mind?

What's your pickup line?

"Wanna come back to my place
and help me look for my balls?"

It was one ball, and I found it.

Charlie, don't you think
you need to slow down a bit?

Why would I wanna do that?

Oh, come on.

Is this lifestyle
actually making you happy?

Let me answer that question
with another question.

Who would you rather be? You or me?

You're kidding, right?

You have two black eyes
and you're perched on a scrotum cozy.

You.

- Hi.
- Hey there.

Oh, sweet Lord.

Can I buy you a drink?

If you want to.

Well, I'd like to buy you an airplane,
but let's start with the drink.

- I'm Charlie.
- Pepper.

Oh, my favorite condiment.

- It's a spice.
- Shut up.

So, Charlie...

No kidding.

Well, then...

All right,
you're under arrest for solicitation.

Stand up, put your hands behind
your back and spread your legs.

I'm afraid
you're gonna have to choose one.

Now will you admit
you've got a problem?

Hey, that was entrapment.

I'm the victim here.

If she wasn't a cop, what did you think
you were gonna do with her?

I really don't know.

Charlie, don't you see
what's happening to you?

Nothing's happening, except I offered
to buy a policewoman a $500 martini.

Well, then there's no point
in my talking to you anymore.

All right.
Then something good came of this.

You stay away from my girlfriend.

You're gonna have to be
more specific.

Son of a bitch.

So, Charlie, what's been going on?

Well...

...I've got a new career.

As a crash-test dummy?

Writing songs for little kids.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Turns out immature minds
respond to me.

Sounds about right.

Let's see. What else?

My mom's getting married. Nice guy.

- Good for her.
- Yeah, yeah.

- My brother still lives with me.
- Sure.

We knew he wasn't
going anywhere.

Let's see.

My nephew's growing like a weed.

My ex-fiancée's getting married.
I've been dating. Nothing serious.

And as you can see,
I've had a couple of mishaps.

Well, except for the facial lacerations
and the rectal doughnut...

...hardly noticeable.

It's actually a testicular doughnut.

- What's the difference?
- About that much.

Well, that's disturbing.

Let's circle back to the ex-fiancée.

- What was her name?
- Mia.

Mia. How do you feel about Mia getting
married and moving on with her life?

I feel fine about it. I'm happy for her.

No remorse, no regrets?

Not really. It's been a long time.

Okay.

So when did you learn
about her upcoming nuptials?

I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.

Yep, two weeks.

You carry the announcement
around with you?

- Yeah. Why?
- No reason.

And you say you've been dating a lot.

- A little more than usual.
- When did that new pattern start?

Gee, I don't know.
It's gotta be a couple of weeks now.

- What?
- Oh, come on, Charlie.

Just because I get paid by the hour
doesn't mean this should take forever.

It's pretty clear that the news
about this woman getting married...

...has hurt you, and you're acting out.

Man, you shrinks wanna bring
everything back to feelings, don't you?

Think it has anything to do
with your toilet training?

- No.
- Then I guess we're stuck with feelings.

Now, when you read that
announcement, how did you feel?

I don't know. How you feel when the
woman you were once in love with...

...is getting married to another guy.
- Describe it.

- Describe it?
- Just for fun.

It's hard to say exactly.

I guess it's kind of like...

...a trapdoor opens up
under your feet and you're falling.

And at the same time, there's this
enormous pressure on your chest...

...like a big animal,
maybe a possum or a raccoon...

...is sitting on it.

And you can't catch your breath.

Possum or a raccoon.

- Lf you're writing it down, say raccoon.
- Will do.

I don't know why I said possum.

It's okay.

Do you think it's possible
that this feeling of falling...

...and the raccoon on your chest
is a physical manifestation...

...of unexpressed grief?

- Grief?
- You know, sadness.

How do you read sadness into that?

Look, Charlie, you're a smart guy.

Emotionally:

But you gotta see
what's going on here.

You're using this series
of meaningless sexual liaisons...

...to run away from your feelings
about losing this woman.

No, no, I'm sorry. I don't see it.

Let's keep looking.

What about my mom getting married?
That can upset a fella, right?

Make him go all ancient Greek
and poke his eyes out?

Oh, come on, Charlie,
you loved this woman.

And I'd say you still love her.

And deep down, maybe you were hoping
someday you'd get back together.

And the only reason you're not
sitting here weeping...

...is because it's too painful
for you.

I'm sorry. I just can't see it.

You can't see it
because your penis is in the way.

Thank you.

Not a compliment, Charlie.

Says you.

Look, you have
a very simple choice here.

You can honestly
confront these emotions...

...and learn the lessons they bring...

...or you can drive yourself into
an early grave with indiscriminate sex.

Define "early."

What are you doing?

I'm trying to feel my feelings.

Really?

- How's it going?
- Not well.

See? Nothing, no grief.

What exactly
are you trying to grieve over?

Well, Mia's getting married...

Wait, wait, wait. Mia?

- The one you were gonna marry?
- Yeah.

And my shrink thinks
I'm pretty upset about it.

Do you think you're upset about it?

I don't know.

- I really did love her.
- I know you did.

Yeah.

I remember this one time...

...we were driving to
Santa Barbara for the weekend...

...and she just smiled at me.

And I thought:

"Man, I could spend the rest of my life
with this woman, no problem."

And then...

Then I lost her.

And I don't think
I'm gonna find anybody like her again.

What the hell is going on, Alan?

This is good. This is good.
You're finally starting to feel your grief.

And once you really feel it
and accept it...

...you can get on with your life
without Mia.

- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Let it out.

No, this is crap.

Where are you going?

I just realized...

...I won't have to feel my feelings and
live without Mia if I just go get her back.

- That's your solution?
- Yeah... right?

Indeed.

Forgot my doughnut.

You laugh, but it really does help.

Bride? Seen the bride?

- I got a delivery for the bride.
- I think she's in there.

Thanks. Here you go.

You look so beautiful.

You are so lucky.

- Hey.
- Charlie.

What are you doing here?

- I came to get you back.
- Are you out of your mind?

No, no. I got the idea from my shrink.

Could you ladies give us a minute?

- Okay. One minute.
- Thanks.

How are you? Looking good.

Don't worry, your big day will come.

Charlie, I'm getting married in an hour.

- So I'm not too late.
- Oh, you are so too late.

Just hear me out.

Oh, my God, what happened to you?

No big deal.

I just yanked a kid
out of the way of a speeding bus.

Got clipped by the side mirror.

Okay, that's a bunch of crap.

But this is the truth.

Mia, I have never felt about any woman
like I feel about you.

And the thought of you
marrying some other guy is...

It's breaking my heart.

So I'm just going for broke here.

Mia, I love you.

I will always love you,
and I want you to marry me.

Honey, the photographer wants to...

- What's going on?
- Daddy, I told you about Charlie Harper.

- Remember?
- Oh, good. I'm glad you're here, sir.

I'd like to ask you for your...

How much did you tell him?

Thanks.

- You need some more ice for your jaw?
- No.

- Your nose?
- No.

How about the chestnuts?

- Resting comfortably. Thanks.
- Okay. Well, try to get some sleep.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

I learned something about myself.

That you're a bleeder?

I learned why I screw around so much.

- Really?
- Yep.

I think I've spent my whole life...

...trying to fill the empty space
in myself by, you know...

Filling the empty space in others.

Exactly.

That's quite an insight.

Well, I'm deep in therapy now.

You went for one hour, Charlie.

Fifty minutes. It's kind of a racket.

But the point is, I've hit bottom.

I can't keep going like this.

- It's time for me to grow up.
- I agree.

So, what are you gonna do?

Well, I thought I'd find some chick
with a big heart and a tiny ass...

...and marry her.

Maybe that girl from the beach.
She seemed nice.

- You're going to get married?
- Yep.

Settle down, have a couple of kids
and ship the penis up to Cooperstown.

Cooperstown?

It is my bat.

Well, sounds like you've got
everything figured out.

You don't ever
figure this stuff out, Alan.

You just take little baby steps on a
lifelong path to becoming a better man.

How many pain pills have you taken?

Nine.

Good night.

Might not be a bad idea
to check on me in an hour or so.

- Make sure I'm still breathing.
- I always do.

Mia.

My balls.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

So I'm thinking we serve the good wine
before the ceremony...

...and then at the reception,
after everybody's got a buzz on...

...we uncork the crap.

Alan, I do not want to cheap out on
what is very possibly my last wedding.

He's always been stingy.

I remember once when he was a little
boy, he accidentally swallowed a quarter.

Refused to poop for a week.

Mom, for God's sakes,
this is my future stepsister.

Oh, relax, Alan. I think it's cute.

Cute? He's so tight, I wouldn't have been
surprised if only two dimes came out.

Mom, I'm begging you.

Would you feel better if I told you
something embarrassing about me?

- Yes.
- Promise not to laugh?

- I promise.
- All right.

I have never in my life refused to poop.

You are so mean. I love you.

I think I liked it better
when you two didn't get along.

Well, those days are over.

Once I saw how happy Evy makes
my father, I could've married her myself.

Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
And you're like the daughter I never had.

Not that he didn't try.

You should have seen him parading
around in my earrings and my high heels.

"Look at me, Mommy, I'm pretty."

He wasn't, of course.

Oh, darling, I'm just teasing you.

You're all man.

Thanks.

Okay, let's talk appetizers.

Hey, Alan, how long do I have
before Bridezilla gets here?

Gee, Charlie,
I don't know what you're talking about.

She's already here, isn't she?

Yes, dear. Come on down.

It's a little game we play.

I show him unconditional love,
and he's an ungrateful little pissant.

- Hey, Mom.
- Hello, dear.

You remember Teddy's daughter,
Courtney?

How could I forget?

- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

Courtney and your brother are helping
me with the wedding arrangements.

It's your fifth wedding, Mom.
What do you need help with?

Besides remembering the groom's name?

I'd cut him out of the will if I thought
there was a chance he'd outlive me.

Hello? Oh, Teddy, darling.

What's up?

Excuse me.

That's wonderful.
Can you keep it up till I get there?

All right, I want to make sure
we're all on the same page here.

This wedding will be ruined
if Mom finds out...

...her son and future stepdaughter
have been carrying on behind her back.

- Don't worry.
- She won't.

No, I do worry.
There can be no flirting, no innuendo.

Don't worry about "innuendo,"
worry about "in-her-end-o."

Everybody keeps their troublemakers
in their pants.

Hey, I'll cooperate,
but I can't speak for my troublemaker.

Alan, Teddy wants to talk to you
about the boutonnieres.

Coming.

I knew he'd fight me on this.

So when can we get together?

We can't. You and I are done.

Why? Just because of what Alan said?
Nobody listens to Alan.

Hell, half the time,
Alan doesn't listen to Alan.

I finally have a good relationship
with your mother. I'd like to keep it.

Hey, a good relationship with my mother
is highly overrated.

Look at me,
I've gone my whole life without one.

Charlie, get it through your head.
You and I, no more.

If it were that simple,
they wouldn't call it "troublemaker."

I'd like to make a little toast.
To our families coming together.

Hear, hear.

- To coming together.
- No.

Evelyn is gaining a daughter
and I'm gaining two sons.

- And a grandson.
- Don't interrupt.

I'd like to say something else. I want
this to be an old-fashioned marriage.

Darling, what's mine is yours.

We do not need a prenup.

Teddy, we've talked about this.

You have a lot of money.
You should be protected.

I don't need to be protected
from you, baby.

- Daddy, wait a minute.
- This is none of your business.

- But, Dad.
- But nothing.

I love this woman.

And I'm not gonna bet
against our marriage...

...by bringing a bunch of lawyers
into it.

- He must really love her.
- Yeah.

The schmuck.

Excuse me.

I had a thought about the ice sculpture.

A lot of people go with Cupid...

...but you gotta remember,
the bow and arrow melts first...

...and what you're left with
is a fat kid dancing in shrimp.

There's gonna be shrimp?

For the guests.

- So what am I?
- Don't feed me straight lines, dear.

Excuse me.

Why would I feed her straight lines
if there's shrimp?

- I'll be out in a minute.
- I can't wait. You'd better let me in now.

Charlie, get out of here.

Oh, come on.
You can't just cut me off like this.

Hey, I can cut off whoever
or whatever I want.

Are you playing hard-to-get
because you know it turns me on?

I'm not playing, Charlie.

Okay, I just have to say,
not playing turns me on more.

Charlie, are you in there
with Courtney?

No.

- Hi, Courtney.
- Hey, Alan.

- I thought we had an agreement.
- Yeah.

The agreement was
Mom doesn't find out.

Courtney? Are you okay, dear?

Oh, I'm fine, Evelyn.

I thought you might be upset
about that prenup nonsense.

And I just want you to know,
I'm not after your father's money.

I'm sure you're not.

Believe me,
I've got plenty of my own money.

Of course, don't tell Alan and Charlie,
they're annoying enough as it is.

I won't.

So exactly how rich are you?

I do all right.

When you marry my grandma,
what does that make you to me?

Nothing.

Sorry, dear.

Oh, that's all right.
I was talking to the kid.

- Isn't that nice?
- You know, even if we're not related...

...you could still buy me
birthday and Christmas presents.

Thanks for the tip.

I don't believe it.

If Mom's got so much money, how come
we still get books for Christmas?

Let it go, Alan.

Whatever money she has most likely
has got an ancient curse attached to it.

- What are you doing?
- I'm here, I figured what the hell?

- Remember to put the seat back down.
- It's a ladies' room.

Why do they even go up?

I don't know. It's a bigger target for
broads who want to puke their dinner.

Makes sense.

All right, let's talk about Courtney.

- What do you want me to tell you?
- Why you're so obsessed with her.

Isn't it obvious?
She drinks, she smokes, she gambles.

She's me with indoor plumbing.

What are you doing in the ladies' room?

The men's room was occupied.

Do you have to pee sitting down?

- No, the seats go up.
- Cool.

Hey, it smells nice in here.

Hey, Courtney.
It's Charlie, your brother.

Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for
making a scene there in the restaurant.

I'd still love to get together,
so give me a call.

I'm just sitting at home,
reading a book.

And watching TV.

Disney Channel, 101 Dalmatians.

What a great film, huh?

Sat on the remote.

Hey, Apocalypse Now.

Another great movie, huh?

Anyway, call me.

- Hi, Charlie.
- Rose?

What the hell are you doing here?

I could ask you that question.

And the answer would be the same:
Stalking.

- No. No, I'm not...
- Good at it?

- What do you want?
- Right now or long-term?

Rose.

I've just been watching you for an hour
and 38 minutes, and I felt bad for you.

I thought maybe
you could use some help.

Thanks, but I'm fine.

Really? Did you bring water?

No.

Trail mix?

No.

Pee jar?

- That would have been a great idea.
- Here you go.

- Thank you.
- Let's see. What else?

Night-vision goggles?

- I don't think so.
- You say that now...

...but if you hide in her trunk
and wanna do a little light reading...

...you're gonna be sorry.

- I'm fine.
- Okay.

I'll just keep you company.
Give me one of these...

...if you need to use the pee jar.

Charlie, what the hell are you doing?

Hey. Teddy. How are you?

Since when do you drive a Volvo?

It's my brother's car.

Very smart.
She would have spotted your car.

I didn't give you points for that.

I thought you and I
had an understanding...

...you and my daughter weren't
gonna see each other anymore.

In my defense, we're not really
seeing each other. This is more of a...

Reconnaissance mission.

Who is this?

This is Rose, she's kind of my...

Sidekick.

I don't wanna beat this to death,
but if your mother finds out...

...you and Courtney are seeing
each other, and I kept it from her...

...I don't know what she'd do.
Probably call off the wedding.

I'm sorry, Teddy.
I don't want to screw things up.

- Well, then, go home.
- Right.

Nice to meet you, Rose.

Boy, if he was 30 years younger,
I'd be following him.

Oh, what the hell.

You were with her, weren't you?

What are you, my wife?

No, I'm the wedding planner.

I'm the one who's dealing with caterers
and florists and musicians...

...and parking valets
and a thousand frozen butterflies.

- Frozen butterflies?
- Mom wanted butterflies.

What'll she do, eat them?

No, you thaw them out
during the ceremony...

...and when the bride and groom kiss,
they fly away.

- Is there still gonna be shrimp?
- Yes, there's gonna be shrimp.

Good. I like shrimp.

Charlie, I will not have you
ruin this wedding.

Well, you can relax.
I wasn't with Courtney.

Thank God for that.
So where were you?

Parked outside her apartment.

You were stalking her?

Oh, man,
why does everybody use that word?

- It has such a bad connotation.
- Charlie, what is wrong with you?

- I've never seen you like this before.
- I know, I know.

I can't get her out of my mind.

I go to sleep thinking about her,
I wake up thinking about her.

The other day,
I stumbled into a three-way...

- How do you stumble into a three-way?
- It's usually a roommate thing.

You read about sisters,
but that almost never happens.

Anyway, in order to get through it...

...I had to fantasize
that both of them were Courtney.

- How sad is that?
- I'm brokenhearted for you.

You know what I think?

I think the only reason you're obsessed
with Courtney is you can't have her.

Well, duh.

- Oh, please tell me you're not calling her.
- Of course not.

Hey, Rose, it's Charlie.
Listen, after you're done with Teddy...

...can you swing by Courtney's
and let me know what she's doing?

Okay, the vows. Now, I understand
you've written your own?

First I'm hearing about it.

Oh, forgive me, darling.
I took the liberty of writing both of ours.

I come across kind of fruity, don't I?

Well, you're in love with me.
Love makes everyone a little gay.

Terrific.

Please let that be my butterflies.
Please, please, please.

That kid doesn't need butterflies.

Hi, Courtney. Come on in.

No, that's okay.
I just need to talk to my father.

- What's up, baby?
- Is Courtney here?

Hi, Courtney.

Hi, Charlie. Dad, it's kind of private.
Can I talk to you outside, please?

Sure. Excuse me.

Did you happen to see
a frozen-butterfly truck go by?

- Everything okay?
- No, no, everything is not okay.

Always good to see you.

- I don't understand why you won't help.
- Damn it, we've been through this.

- I'm not gonna keep bailing you out.
- But, Daddy...

Don't "But, Daddy" me.

Sure makes you feel grateful
that the three of us get along so well.

- Am I supposed to live on the street?
- Live within your means.

You're just gonna turn your back?
Your own daughter?

- Oh, don't be such a drama queen.
- Forget it, I'm out of here.

Courtney, don't be like that.

Okay, the butterflies.

Now, Mom, when you kiss Teddy,
they're gonna be released on the deck.

But there's a fifty-fifty chance that gulls
will swoop down and rip them to shreds.

I'm sorry you heard that.

- Do you want me to talk to her?
- No, no, leave it alone.

I'll go talk to her.

Would either of you care to explain
why he's going to talk to her?

- No.
- No.

- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

I was concerned about you.
I thought maybe I could help.

You can't help me.

Try me.

I was looking at the wrong window.

- What?
- Nice place.

So, what's going on?

What do you want me to tell you,
Charlie?

I lost my job,
I'm about to lose my condo...

...and my father won't lift a finger
to help me.

How much do you need?

Forget it, I can't take your money.

Well, I hadn't actually offered yet.

But we are gonna be family,
and family looks after each other.

I need $50,000.

How about if I talk to your dad?

It's no use.

He's trying to teach me a lesson.

You know, I just
love this place so much.

I put every dime I had into it.

Charlie, what am I gonna do?

You're gonna take
the money from me.

No.

No, it wouldn't be right.

I insist.

Really?

I promise I'll pay you back.

I know you will.

Thank you.

So much.

No, no, no, that's not why
I'm doing this.

I know, I know, but I want you.

I want you too...

...but I don't wanna feel like we're
doing this because I lent you money.

Okay, okay. But soon?

Definitely soon.

- Good night.
- Night.

Oh, hell, if you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

"And I promise to honor
and cherish you...

...to always be there for you
as a trusted friend...

...devoted husband and selfish lover."

"Selfless."

Oh, right, selfless.

"And even though
I'm significantly older than you...

...I feel renewed and replenished...

...every time I drink
the sweet nectar of your youth."

Pick it up, Teddy.
No one can see butterflies in the dark.

"I remember the first time
I laid eyes on you...

...at one of the many charity events to
which you so tirelessly devote yourself.

You were a vision in Dolce & Gabbana
and compassion.

And that first moment we spoke,
the simple melody of your voice...

...was testimony
to how much the world lost...

...when you gave up
a very promising singing career...

...in order to raise your two little boys.

Not that they ever appreciated it.

And the lovemaking...

...what can I say
about the lovemaking?"

- I can't say this.
- Lf you don't, I will.

"As I explored every inch of your firm,
non-surgically-enhanced body...

...I finally learned the meaning
of the words 'heaven on earth'...

...and 'natural redhead.'

In the words of the Bard:

Shall I compare thee
to the summer's day?

Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

Rough winds do shake
The darling buds of May

Will you marry me?

And summer's lease
hath all to short a date.

- Really?
- Yes.

- So long as men can breathe
- Yes.

- Our eyes can see
- Really?

So long lives this,
and gives life to thee. "

You may now kiss the bride.

Do you want me to sweep them up
and pop them in the microwave?

Never mind.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

It's hard to believe after all these years,
we've got a new stepdad.

I give it six months.

Come on, we like Teddy.

That's why I'm only giving it six months.
I'm rooting for him.

Still, you have to admit,
it was a beautiful ceremony.

The bride and groom, the sun setting.

The dead butterflies.

Remind me to call the butterfly people
first thing Monday.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

We don't eat from the cake
until we cut the cake.

But I'm still hungry.

Have some cheese.

Have we cut the cheese?

Get it?

Hey, stepbrother.

Change your mind
about wanting to marry me?

Not at all.

Wanna go upstairs and get a head start
on our honeymoon?

You keep rubbing against me...

...I'll be able to catch my
mom's garter without my hands.

- Charlie.
- What?

At your mother's wedding?

Yeah.

I ain't cleaning it up.

Boy, this is pretty kinky.

Kinky good or kinky bad?

There's a kinky bad?

Watch your elbow.

That's not my elbow.

Charlie.

It's not that either.

Daddy?

This is awkward.

Daddy, are you okay?

- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

Well?

This might be a mood breaker.

So are you a friend of the bride
or the groom?

Well, the bride is my mother, so...

The groom.

Hey, how do you like my house?

Oh, it's beautiful.

- Alan, I have to talk to you.
- Go away. I've got a shot here.

No, you don't.

- Come upstairs with me.
- Why?

Just come on.

Be right back.

Friend of the bride
or friend of the groom?

Friend of mine.

Oh, my God.

Is he...?

As a doorknob.

- Doorbell?
- Doornail.

He's dead.

I can't believe he's gone.

Courtney, I'm so sorry.

So he was just lying there
with his pants down?

Apparently somebody was giving him
a very special wedding present.

- Mom?
- I don't think so.

She's downstairs
acting as if nothing happened.

And more importantly,
she married the guy.

Why would she bother?

Your mother's looking for you guys.

What's going on?

Teddy's dead.

Yeah, that's a stiffy.

We have got a real problem here.

What do you mean "we"?

Oh, this is just gonna suck.

Thank you, thank you. Now, this
next song you may remember...

...from the hit movie Ghost.

Mom?

Mom, we gotta talk to you.

What?

It's about Teddy.

Where is he?
This is supposed to be a duet.

Yeah, well, from now on, I'm afraid
you're gonna be working alone.

You son of a bitch.

So you weren't the one who was...?

Of course not.
I already married the man.

I just can't believe he'd cheat on me
on our wedding day.

Excuse me,
my father is lying here dead.

With his pants around his ankles
and lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

Oh, my, what happened in here?

Berta, my husband is dead.

As a doornail.

Has anybody called the cops?

You might wanna consider it...

...because you only got a limited window
before he starts stinking up the joint.

I'll make the calls.

- No, Mom, you don't have to.
- Yes, I do.

I'm his wife.

Now, please, would you all just
give me a moment alone with him?

- Of course.
- Sure, Mom.

So who do you suppose
was smoking Teddy's sausage?

Berta, that is my father in there.

Okay.

So who do you suppose
was smoking your father's sausage?

Oh, Teddy.

My dear, dear Teddy.

Hello.

This is Evelyn Harper Leopold.

I booked my honeymoon with you.

Yes.

Two business-class tickets to Paris.

I need to exchange them
for one first-class ticket to Fiji.

Sure, I'll hold.

This is a crime scene,
so you're just gonna have to be patient.

We'll need statements from
each of you before you can leave.

Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that
there's a lesson to be learned here.

Life is precious and no one really knows
how long we've got.

So it's important to be grateful
for each day.

So if they're not gonna cut the cake,
can I have some now?

Aren't you full?

No.

Take a look at his pants.

The belt is buckled on an unworn hole.

Someone re-dressed him.

Any of you touch the body?

Interesting.

We've got some peri-mortem
ecchymosis on the posterior occiput.

That means a bruise
on the back of the head.

And yet you still couldn't get
into medical school.

So much for time of death.

Looks like our boy here had some
sexual activity before he bought it.

Hit the light.
I'm gonna check for semen.

My God.

It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.

The ceiling fan's actually a cute story.

- Coffee?
- Thanks.

- So Mr. Harper...
- Call me Charlie.

- And you are?
- Interested in how you found the body.

Oh, right to it, huh?

Okay, well, what have you heard?

That's not how we do this.

You tell me what happened.

All right.

I went upstairs to use the bathroom
and there he was.

Oh, no.

Teddy.

So you're saying you were alone
when you found him?

Well, technically aren't we all alone?

You know, I'm finding that tank top
awfully distracting.

Is that police issue?

Mr. Harper, are you aware...

...that making a false statement
to the police is a crime?

Slap-on-the-wrist crime...

...or pack-my-bags-and-tape-my-butt-shut
crime?

Hey, I like it when it's gift-wrapped.

Okay, okay, I wasn't alone.
I was with Courtney.

- Why'd you lie?
- Oh, come on.

I was trying to nail my stepsister
at my mother's wedding.

Lying seemed the classy way to go.

Did you touch the body?

I was all over her body.

Oh, you mean Teddy?

No, no, no.
Not after I knew he was there.

Who do you suppose
pulled up his pants?

Are you thinking whoever pulled
them up is the one who killed him?

It's crossed our minds.

Oh, gee,
I don't wanna implicate anybody.

Right now,
the only one implicated is you.

Talk to my mother.

What is that? Nondairy creamer?

Just take me to the green mile
and be done with it.

That's all we've got.

Please, this place is crawling with cops.
One of them can't make a Starbucks run?

- Mrs. Harper...
- Mrs. Leopold.

Mrs. Leopold.

Did you touch your husband's body
before the police arrived?

All right, yes, I pulled up his pants.

- Why?
- Because it was embarrassing.

There was lipstick on his hoo-hoo.

- Your lipstick?
- Oh, God, no.

I'd rather drink your coffee.

So he was with another woman?

Not necessarily.

Do you have another theory
for where the lipstick came from?

Have you ruled out clowns?

You should check
for really big footprints.

Okay, he was with another woman.

- I imagine that made you pretty angry.
- I don't get angry. I get even.

I mean, what are you insinuating?

I'm insinuating that maybe
you caught him in the act.

- Evie.
- You cheating bastard.

Evie, I can explain.

Evie, I can explain.

I can explain.

And Paris for two becomes Fiji for one.

We checked your phone records.

Listen, let me tell you something.

I loved that man and he loved me.

In fact, he loved me so much,
he didn't even ask for a prenup.

And believe me, he's got money.
Big money.

Well, we don't have to look very hard
to find a motive for you, do we?

I'm warning you,
coffee tends to shoot through me.

So if you've got a cavity search
planned, you better do it pretty quick.

We don't need to do a cavity search.

Can I request one?

What do you know
about Teddy Leopold?

I know he was hot for me.

He was always flirting.

Berta, this is mom's boyfriend, Teddy.
Teddy, my housekeeper Berta.

- A pleasure.
- It could be if you play your cards right.

You can't blame him.

You gotta figure that boinking Evelyn
is like riding a bicycle over train tracks.

You'll get where you're going,
but you're gonna feel every bump.

- How's the hot chocolate?
- Good. I like the powdered stuff...

...because there's always something
to chew on when you get to the bottom.

- You got any donuts?
- Nope.

- Danish?
- Nope.

Pie?

Look, Jake, what I wanna know is...

...were you in your uncle's room
at any time today?

- No, I never go in my uncle's room.
- Why not?

Because all the skin mags
are in my dad's room.

Okay, let me just start out by saying
I know about the illegal left-turn ticket.

And I've been meaning
to take care of it...

...but, you know, business has been
slow, and bills just keep coming.

Of course I don't have to tell you that.

Our law enforcement personnel
are underpaid.

Thank you for the coffee, by the way.

Cops and truck drivers, you know
your coffee. Am I going to jail?

Tell me about you
and Teddy Leopold.

Oh, I loved Teddy.
He was like a father to me.

- Is that so?
- Yeah, yeah.

He took me to Vegas,
brought me a hooker.

Would any of you gentlemen
like a date?

Sorry, doll, I'm taken.

But I wouldn't mind
footing the bill for my two boys here.

Hi, I'm Amber.

I'm Tiffany.

- Thanks, Daddy.
- Thanks, Daddy.

A hooker?

And gelato.

- You got my blessing, Teddy.
- Shut up and eat your gelato.

So you were happy
he married your mother?

Are you kidding? I was thrilled.

I planned the wedding.
And it went great.

The reception not so much.

Why, what happened?

The groom died.

Remember?

Do you need to write that down?

Any idea
who might have wanted him dead?

No, no, everybody loved Teddy.

And he was so good to my mom.

It's a shame
she has to bury another husband.

Another husband?

Yeah, well, she's, you know,
had a bit of bad luck...

...in the dead spouse department.

Not that you can have good luck
in the dead spouse department.

Can I have some more coffee?

Who ratted me out? Was it Alan?

Oh, it doesn't matter.

Either one of them would throw me
under a bus for an Eskimo Pie.

We'd just like to know
about your late husbands.

All right. There's not much to tell.

Charlie and Alan's father
died of food poisoning.

Where'd he get the food?

I was a young bride.
I was just learning to cook.

And nobody told me
you don't keep fish in a drawer.

All right, what about the others?

Oh, the usual.

Couple of heart attacks,
a bathtub electrocution.

Why are you grilling me?

I'm not the one who was
fighting with him over money.

Who was?

I don't understand
why you won't help.

We've been through this.
I'm not gonna keep bailing you out.

- But, Daddy, l...
- Don't "But Daddy" me.

What am I to do?
Live on the street?

You're supposed to live
within your means.

I want a lawyer.

Tall soy latte, no foam.

Grandmommy
can't drink this cop swill anymore.

- Mom, they told us to wait here.
- Well, that's why I'm sending Jake.

Think of it as job training, dear.

Hi, Charlie.

Hey, Charlie.

Hi, Charlie.

Hi, Alan.

I'm not the one
who's got a husband...

...with someone else's lipstick
on his dipstick.

Has anybody seen Courtney?

She's talking to her attorney.

Why does she need an attorney?

GC mass spec analysis revealed
that the lipstick pigment on the body...

...matches lipstick she was wearing.
- Wait.

- Courtney with her own father?
- Not according to their DNA.

- They're not even related.
- What?

- You're kidding.
- They're con artists, grifters.

Wanted in half a dozen states.

His real name is Nathan Krunk
and she is Sylvia Fishman.

That can't be right.

I was gonna marry her.

- What?
- What?

We were gonna surprise you,
but I guess that ship has sailed.

They've got a record of marital fraud.

They pick out marks
with more money than brains...

...and then take them down the aisle.

You're just gonna
turn your back on me?

- Don't be such a drama queen.
- You know what, forget it.

- I'm out of here.
- Courtney, don't be like that.

But I don't understand.

Teddy didn't need money.
He was a very wealthy man.

And I practically had to force Courtney
to take my $50,000.

But what about his lifestyle?

The private jet, the trips to Vegas?

Bad checks, stolen credit cards.

The reason he didn't want a prenup
is so he could get your money.

But then why would Courtney
kill her own partner?

She didn't.

They were going at it hot and heavy
and his heart gave out.

Yeah, I can see that happening.

What threw us off at first was
the bruising on the back of his head.

Then autopsy revealed
that had happened roughly 48 hours...

...before time of death.

Still up to get together,
so give me a call.

I'm just sitting at home,
reading a book.

That hurts.

Wanna switch?

Yeah, let's try banging
your head for a while.

I don't believe it.

She used me, she scammed me,
she took my money.

- Courtney.
- What?

I'll wait for you.

Got a postcard from the black widow.

No kidding.

- How's her honeymoon going?
- Pretty good apparently.

She's already met
a wealthy real-estate investor.

I gotta admit, the woman's got spirit.

No matter what life throws at her,
she always lands on her back.

What's the matter?

- Oh, Jake.
- Oh, God.

That was a good one, wasn't it?

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Got your homework done?

- All of it?
- Yep.

Attaboy.
You just get to kick back this weekend.

That's my plan.

Except...?

Except nothing.

Well, excuse me.

- Oh, yeah.
- There it is.

I might have to write
a book report for Monday.

What do you mean you might have to?

If there's no earthquake
by Monday morning...

...I have to write a book report.

Oh, God. So, what's the book?

William Shakespeare's
The Taming Of The Shrew.

By William Shakespeare.

That'll come in handy when he's mopping
out the toilets at the House of Pancakes.

You know,
I could go for some pancakes.

Jake, please tell me you read the book.

I really wish I could, Dad.

I was gonna read it, but I can't find it.

You lost the book?

What do you intend to do
about the report?

You mean aside from the earthquake?

Yeah.

Well, I kind of put all my eggs
in the earthquake basket.

Get dressed. We're going to the store.

- Well, can we stop for pancakes?
- Go.

I bet you're sorry you took
all that LSD before you had him.

I never took any LSD.

You might wanna start
telling people you did.

Unbelievable. You had four weeks
to write this book report.

Get over it, Dad.

Yeah, Alan. Relax.

He'll have eight weeks
of summer school to do it.

Unless there's an earthquake.

Excuse me, could you tell me
where the classic literature section is?

- Third floor near the restroom.
- Thank you.

Go ahead. I'm gonna look at magazines.

They don't sell those kinds of magazines
here. I checked.

Come on, you little perv.
Meet me back here.

Wait, was that an earthquake?

Can I help you find anything?

Yeah, I'm looking for a book.

You probably need more than that.

I want a book about,
you know, relationship stuff.

Relationship stuff.

No, not "relationship stuff,"
just relationship stuff.

In the self-help section.

- Thanks.
- Best of luck.

This is worse than buying condoms.

Okay, let's see.

"Why Relationships Fail."

"Smart Women, Foolish Choices."

Thank God for those gals.

- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

Oh, "Embracing Your Soul Mate."

Oh, "soul mate."
I thought it was "cellmate."

You know, a prison love story?

I see.

Not that I'm into prison love stories.

I like the girls-in-prison stuff.

Oh, who am I kidding?

I'm looking for some help, okay?

You're not alone. There are
millions of people looking for help.

Gee, thanks for making me feel special.

Let me ask you something.

What would you change about yourself
if you could?

- I don't know, little things, I guess.
- Like what?

Well,
I guess I'd like to be a little happier.

Maybe find a way to sustain
a healthy relationship with a woman...

...so I don't,
you know, grow old and die alone...

...incontinent and unloved.

Yes, the little things.

Can I recommend a book for you?

Well, as long as I'm here.

"Breaking Barriers:
Finding The Intimacy You Deserve."

I don't know.
I was hoping to do better than I deserve.

Give it a chance.
I hear it's helped a lot of people.

For 25 bucks, it better wash my car.

Wait a minute, is this you?

Armor All's extra.

- Cool. Will you sign it for me?
- Oh, I'd be happy to. What's your name?

- Charlie.
- Okay.

Great.

Now, that it's autographed,
I'm not a loser, I'm a collector.

Here you go.

"To Charlie, reading a self-help book
doesn't make you less of a man."

Okay, back to loser.

You're not a loser.

Like most men,
you're just afraid to be vulnerable.

Excuse me, but what sane person
wants to be vulnerable?

If you're not vulnerable,
you can't feel anything.

Yeah, and?

Read the book.

Wait.

Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

- Why?
- I'd like to talk to you some more.

Are you still gonna buy the book?

I have to. You wrote all over it.

- Then sure, why not?
- Great.

If I give you the money,
will you pay for it?

I don't need any more sympathy
from the help.

What's a shrew anyway?

Oh, it's a small rodent.

Oh, so this is like Stuart Little?

No, no, it's about a man
trying to control a willful, angry woman.

Is he trying to control her with rodents?

I don't wanna spoil it for you.

Let's just find your Uncle Charlie
and get out of here.

Excuse me, have you seen a guy,
dark hair, bowling shirt, shorts?

Oh, yeah, the self-help guy.

No, that doesn't sound like him.

A guy like that just left
with a pretty blond woman.

That sounds like him.

Dad, this is the wrong book.

- What are you talking about?
- It's in some sort of foreign language.

It's Elizabethan.

Well, can we get one in English?

Walk.

How could you
have already lost the book?

I didn't do it on purpose.
What are you yelling at me for?

Because it's one of the few pleasures
of being your father.

- Oh, look who's here. Thanks a lot.
- What did I do?

You stranded us at the mall.
We had to take the bus.

The bus, I left the book on the bus.
There, mystery solved.

Go get in the car.

- Where are we going?
- Where do you think we're going?

Well, we never did get those pancakes.

We're going to the bookstore
to buy another book.

- This one's coming out of your allowance.
- What allowance?

- I'm supposed to be getting an allowance?
- Go get your shoes.

- Did you guys feel that?
- Move it.

So guess what.

I'm gonna transform my life
and get the intimacy I deserve.

Fantastic.

You work on that while
I go back to the mall with taterhead.

Not only that,
I met the author and she's amazing.

- The woman you dumped us for?
- Yeah, know what she told me?

No idea.

She told me that my fear of being hurt
keeps me from feeling anything at all.

It's like I'm living in an emotional prison
that I built myself.

How about that? You abandoned us.

I know, but get this.

I'm not just a prisoner, I'm the warden.

We had to take two buses and walk a mile
on the Pacific Coast Highway...

...during rush hour.

I get it. I understand.

But the good news is
I hold the keys to my own freedom.

There's no sidewalk
on the Pacific Coast highway.

Okay, okay, I hear you.

You're angry and resentful.

But what you need to understand...

...is that resentment is the mortar that
holds the bricks of Ioneliness together...

...in a wall of alienation and despair.

Chapter 3, "Knocking Down the Wall."

Bite me.

That's Chapter 1 in my forthcoming book
entitled Bite Me.

Chapter 2 is called,
"Kiss My Pale White Ass."

- We can't go back to the mall.
- Why not?

My shoes are missing.

Another mystery solved.

Wrong foot, buddy.

Oh, yeah, thanks.

Guess I should be reading
Taming of the Shoe.

Get it?

You might wanna start thinking
about having him neutered.

This is delicious.

I've never had Ethiopian food before.

I've loved it
ever since I lived in Ethiopia.

When did you live there?

Let's see.

It would have to be 1972.

1972? Were you born there?

Don't be silly. This was right after college.
I was in the Peace Corps.

College, 1972.

Need a pencil?

No, no, no.

I was just thinking
what I was doing in 1972.

Oh, tell me.

I don't have a vivid memory of it...

...but I'm sure that's the year
I graduated to the big-boy potty.

It was quite a year for both of us.

So are you still using
that college degree?

Because I'm still using
the big-boy potty.

You're used to going out
with younger women, aren't you?

Well, I don't really think about age
as much as I think about personality...

...and, you know,
chemistry and education, family values.

All right, young and dumb,
you got me.

I'm not judging you, Charlie. You're a man
and you know what you want.

What's wrong with that?

Nothing?

Nothing.

You are fine just the way you are.

- I am?
- Of course, you are.

If I called my mother now,
would you tell her that?

You don't think she knows?

As far as she's concerned...

...the last thing I did right
was evacuate her uterus.

Oh, you poor thing. That's awful.

It is, isn't it?

Every little boy
needs to feel loved and nurtured.

Otherwise, he grows up with a hole
inside him that he can never fill.

Oh, I have got such a big hole.

If my hole could talk.

You've got a little something
right here.

I'll get it.

- There we go.
- Thanks.

You know what?

I like you.

Well, I like you too, Charlie.

Try the Yemiser Kik Wat.

Looks kind of yucky.

Well, don't look at it. Just taste it.

Oh, come on, just one bite. For me?

Okay.

Hey, it's good.

I told you.

Oh, excuse me.
Could I get another napkin?

So, what do they have for dessert?

Well, Charlie,
thank you for a lovely evening.

You're welcome.

Can I kiss you good night?

Do you usually ask permission?

Well, no.

Then why are you asking now?

I don't know.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

Okay, I'm in trouble.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I heard something.

It's okay. Jeremy, this is Charlie.

- Charlie, this is my son, Jeremy.
- Hey, man.

- How are you?
- How's it going?

I didn't mean to interrupt.
I dropped in to fix your computer.

I'll leave you two alone.
Charlie, good meeting you.

Same here.

So that's your son?

- How old is he?
- Thirty-two.

They're cute at that age.

- Hey.
- What?

You're supposed
to be finishing your report.

I know, but I can't find the book.

You're kidding. We just bought it.

What can I say, Dad?

It's a big house and a little book.

Find the book.

- I'm really tired.
- Find the book.

Just saying it won't make it happen.

Find the book!

Heads up. He's losing it.

I should have put frosting
on the damn book.

He's never lost anything
with frosting on it.

I don't know why you continue
to bang your head against the wall.

The kid's obviously destined to sell
tube socks out of the trunk of his car.

A business of his own.

Gee, that'd be swell.

- So how was your date?
- Terrific.

- Then why are you home so early?
- Well, turns out she has a kid.

Single mom, huh?

Yeah.

That's what she is, single mom.

- How old?
- Thirty-two.

- I meant the kid.
- So did I.

You're kidding.

If she's got a 32-year-old kid
that would make her...

Don't do the math, please.

It all goes south
when you do the math.

Come on, so you're dating
an older woman. It's no big deal.

That's it?
You're not gonna give me a hard time?

Don't be silly.
I'm more evolved than that.

Well, good.

Just a gigolo
Everywhere I go

People know the part
I'm playing

I guess I'm not.

Look, this is a spectacular woman...

...and it doesn't matter in the least
how old she is.

Please. You can't even tolerate age spots
on a banana.

Okay, okay, first of all, on a banana,
spots are an indication of mushiness.

And second,
I haven't peeled this woman yet.

In the freezer?

- Jake.
- I found it, I'm reading.

It's really cool.

- For God's sake.
- Hey, I was reading that.

You're writing a report
on The Taming of The Shrew...

...not the voyages of Cap'n Crunch.

Too bad.
I could write the crap out of that.

Okay, I'm not fooling around here.

You're gonna finish this damn book
and write the damn report...

...you're gonna hand it in Monday,
spell-checked...

...formatted and on freaking time.

I have my doubts, Dad.

- Read.
- Fine.

Listen to this.

"A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon:

What! Up and down,
carv'd like an apple-tart?"

All I get from this is
"blah, blah, blah, apple tart."

Have we got any apple tarts?

- Hi.
- Hi.

Good.

I was afraid that first kiss
might have been a fluke.

Well, I don't know about you,
but that was not my first kiss.

Come on in.

Wow, what a beautiful home.

Thank you.

How much of it do you wanna see?

This'll be enough for today.

Understood. Let's hit the road.

Aren't you gonna take a jacket?

I'm okay, don't need one.

- It gets cool in Santa Barbara, Charlie.
- I'll be fine.

Please. If you don't need it,
you can leave it in the car.

All right.

- Take a look around.
- Thanks, I will.

Oh, hi, you must be Angie.

I'm Alan, Charlie's brother.

Oh, of course, hi.
Oh, what a firm handshake.

Oh, well, no one trusts
a chiropractor with limp hands.

Oh, you're a chiropractor?

Hang on.
I could have gotten into medical school.

I didn't wanna spend
four years in South America.

- No, no, I'm a big fan of chiropractics.
- You're kidding.

No, I think you people
are miracle workers.

Okay, I'm ready to go.

Did you put on sun block?

I don't need sun block.

Oh, honey, I think you do.

You have beautiful skin.
I don't wanna see it get burned.

You're right, thanks.

So anyway, you were saying something
about me being a miracle worker?

Oh, God, yes.
I threw my back out last year skiing.

- My chiropractor just about saved my life.
- That's what we do, you know.

We're not flashy, we don't get,
you know, special license plates...

...so we can park
wherever the hell we want.

You know,
nobody makes TV shows about us.

Or calls us McDreamy
or McSteamy or McMuffin.

We just quietly go about
the business of healing.

- I know, I know.
- Thank you, thank you.

I only wish more people appreciated us.

You can't worry about
what people think.

I know, but the lack of respect
really hurts, you know.

Back-cracker, spine-cruncher,
quack, charlatan, witch doctor...

- Alan.
...voodoo priest, fraud, failure.

Hey, hey.

Know what we call people
who say those things?

My family?

We call them damaged.

They need to hurt others
to feel better about themselves.

Exactly, the reason
I don't feel better about myself...

...is I'm not good enough
at hurting them back.

Oh, no, you don't wanna do that.

Yeah, I kind of do.

Alan, you need to ignore the negativity
and open yourself up...

...to the nurturing love
that's all around you.

- Love is all around me?
- Yes.

Is it hiding
behind the loathing and rejection?

Honey, I am loving you right now.

- Really?
- Yes, really.

Thank you.

You are a wonderful,
valuable human being.

I am?

Yes, you are.

I see you're getting to know
my brother.

Isn't this beautiful country?

Yeah, it's swell.

Angie, if you like antiquing,
I know some great little shops.

- I'm not going antiquing.
- Oh, that's okay.

Angie and I will peel off
and you can sit in the park and drink.

Are there any game arcades
in Santa Barbara?

You won't have time.
You have a book to read.

Oh, yeah.

I forgot it.

That's okay.
We can stop at a bookstore.

Oh, gee,
we don't want to ruin your afternoon.

Hey, we invited you.
We want you with us.

- Right, Charlie?
- No.

Oh, don't be that way.

I tell you what, after we get Jake's book,
we'll stop and get ice cream.

Yes.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice, doc.

Not a problem, Charlie.
So, what's the big emergency?

Why does it have to be an emergency?
I wanted to check in.

Well, you left six messages
on my service.

Oh, that was just a liquored up fella
hitting the speed dial.

I got five minutes
before my next patient.

Why don't you just
give me the headlines?

All right, I'm seeing a woman.

That's not a headline,
that's the name of the paper.

I know, I know, but she's different from
the type of woman I usually go out with.

- Yeah? Different how?
- Well, she's a little older.

Well, you really couldn't go younger...

...without having to register
with the authorities.

- I mean, she's older than me.
- Oh, we have our headline.

And I'm confused because
I have really strong feelings towards her.

- Do you find her attractive?
- She's gorgeous.

- How's the sex?
- We haven't had sex yet.

Hold the presses,
we have a new headline.

- Do I have to pay extra for the sarcasm?
- No, it's a flat rate.

The thing is, we get along great.

She's warm, nurturing, supportive.
And I feel really safe with her.

Well, let's see,
you're involved with an older woman...

...who's warm, nurturing and supportive.

You feel very safe with her,
and you haven't had sex.

Now, what male-female relationship
does that suggest?

I feel like I should know this one.

Take your time.

Older, nurturing, warm...

Mrs. Butterworth?

Charlie, this woman you're seeing
is a mother figure.

A mother figure? I said she's warm,
nurturing and supportive.

The words toxic she-devil
did not pass my lips.

My point is, because your real mother
didn't give you...

...what you need emotionally, you're
responding to it in this relationship.

No, no, no. This is not a mother thing.

Now, my brother Alan,
he's the needy one.

He practically wants to sit
in this woman's lap and breastfeed.

And not in a fun way.

- So Alan's met her?
- Yeah.

And he's clinging to her like a tree
monkey, which is really pissing me off.

So you're competing with your brother
for the attention...

...of an older, nurturing woman?

Boy, you're just
a one-string banjo, aren't you?

What do you want me to tell you?
I play the notes in front of me.

I want you to cut all the psychobabble
and tell me why I'm so confused.

I just did.

You're gonna stick
with the mother thing?

Look, Charlie,
I've got my next patient waiting.

If you like, we can make a weekly
appointment and explore these issues.

In fact, twice a week
might not be overdoing it.

No, thanks.
I deal with my demons as they escape.

All right.

So, what do I owe you?

Well, I get $200 an hour.
You were here for five minutes.

So why don't we just round it off
and say $200?

Man. Even hookers prorate.

Hookers don't have to listen to you,
Charlie. Goodbye.

Bye, doc. Good session.

- Hi, come on in.
- Thanks for seeing me last minute.

I think I'm in love
with my brother's girlfriend.

- Hi.
- Hi, yourself.

- Oh, don't you look handsome?
- Nah.

Yes, you do.

- And that shirt looks great on you.
- You think?

- Oh, yes. Very grown-up.
- Well, you bought it for me.

But you should tuck it in, sweetie.

I don't wanna.

- Please?
- Oh, all right.

- Are you ready to go?
- I just need a minute, come on in.

- You remember my son, Jeremy.
- Oh, sure.

- How's it going?
- Hi, good.

- Good.
- Good to see you.

And this is his fiancée, Tricia.

Hi, Tricia. Charlie.

Hi, Charlie. Nice to meet you.

- Mom's helping us plan our wedding.
- Really?

- Yeah.
- You're getting married? Lucky guy.

Not that I'd know. I'm just assuming.

- I'm just gonna get my purse.
- Hurry back. Hop, hop, hop.

So you're getting married.

- Taking the plunge.
- Yeah.

I've never stuck a toe in myself.

Actually, I've never stuck anything in.

Anyway, it's a big step.

Not for me. Tricia's the love of my life.

And I can't believe
nobody snapped her up before I did.

Well, maybe she was just waiting
for the right snapper.

I mean, the past
isn't nearly as important...

...as the future you two
are gonna build together, am I right?

- Absolutely. The past doesn't matter.
- That's what I'm thinking.

Okay, let's go.

Okay, nice seeing you again.
Nice meeting you, bye.

Isn't she terrific? I am so happy...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's a catch, let's go.

Why aren't you studying
for your Algebra final?

Because I don't have to.

- You don't have to study Algebra?
- Nope.

All I gotta do
is get a 67 to pass the course.

Then it's adios seventh grade,
arrivederci eighth.

Okay, we can cross UN interpreter
off the job list.

But let's get back to the Algebra test.
So you're planning on getting a 67?

Yep. Anything above that
would just be wasted effort.

Okay, we have to talk.

Hey, the blind, one-armed dancer's
about to go on.

- This is more important.
- Last week, she fell twice.

Listen to me.

You know what you call someone
who just skates through life...

...doing only the bare minimum?

Uncle Charlie?

You call him a slacker.

- Whatev.
- Whatev?

Are you now so lazy you can't
even be bothered to finish words?

What's your prob? Won't you be happy
if I just get into eighth grade?

I mean, isn't that
the whole point of seventh?

No, that is not
the whole point of seventh.

And yes, I'll be thrilled
if you're not left back.

So relax, it's all good.

Don't you mean it's all goo?

Holy crap, her arm flew off.

That's gotta cost some points.

Two adults for the Wings of Love.

- No, wait. I get a senior discount.
- No, you don't. Full price, both of us.

Charlie, you're being silly.

For 2 bucks, let me be silly.

Hey, Charlie.

Perfect.

We're at the same theater.
What a happy coincidence.

Yeah, just like Booth and Lincoln.

Angie, this is my mother, Evelyn.
Mom, this is Angie.

Nice to meet you, Evelyn,
I've heard a lot about you.

Well, there's two sides to every story.

And Charlie's memory isn't the best.
You know:

And considering how you raised me,
it was either... or:

Charlie, don't be so sensitive.

Have you met his brother?
Another drama queen.

Okay, Mom.
Always great bumping into you.

Maybe next time you'll be standing
in front of a wood chipper.

- Enjoy the movie.
- Bye-bye.

- Hey, Charlie?
- Oh, swell. There's more.

I'll meet you inside.

Yes?

- Be careful, that woman is a cougar.
- A what?

An older woman
who preys on young men.

- That's not what this is about.
- Right, she likes you for your brains.

And I love you for your warmth.

Nice yanking chains with you, Mom.

What did I do to deserve that?

- Here are your keys, Evelyn.
- Thanks, Justin.

So, what movie should we see?

Oh, you pick, darling. You're the one
who'll be facing the screen.

Okay, X is minus four?

Great. You're right.
See? See? You can do this.

On the test,
you have to show your work.

So let's see your work.

There's no work.

Why is there no work?

I don't need to do the work. Suddenly,
I can see all the numbers in my head.

- Really?
- Yeah, it's amazing.

And they all make perfect sense.

It's like the equations
are solving themselves before my eyes.

Oh, my God, you know,
I've read about that kind of thing...

...but my own son?

No, I'm just screwing with you.

The answers are in the back of the book.

Good night.

You should have seen your face
when you thought I was smart.

Am I supposed to go to bed now?

Dad?

I still love him. I still love him.
I still love him. I still love...

- You're only punishing yourself. Let it go.
- Easy for you to say.

Your mom wasn't four rows behind you
in a movie theater...

...dry-humping a Cub Scout.

Oh, hey. I didn't hear you guys come in.

- How did you like Wings of Love?
- Oh, it was terrific.

I thought you'd enjoy the movie.

It's the same cinematographer
as Like Water for Chocolate.

- Yes. Would you like some wine?
- I'd love some.

Here's 10 bucks.
Go get yourself a bottle.

Gee, thanks, but I can't go out now.

I just put my little boy to bed.

You got a little boy?
Aren't you afraid Jake will eat him?

How do you like being a father, Alan?

Well, you know, I'd have to say
that it's wonderfully rewarding.

And more than a little challenging.
Jake's kind of a diamond in the rough.

Jake's kind of a turd in the punch bowl.

Charlie, that is no way
to talk about a child.

He's not a child.

He's a post-pubescent tapeworm
with a bad haircut.

Charlie.

- Was your divorce very hard on him?
- You have no idea.

I'll tell you who his divorce
was hard on. Me.

- Stop playing the martyr.
- Stop living in my house.

- Here we go.
- You keep saying that, but you never go.

I think I'll just go powder my nose.

- See? You drove her away.
- Oh, I drove her away?

- I'm not the one with the poop talk.
- Poop talk?

You called my son
a turd in a punch bowl.

I said it with love.

Anyway, I know what's going on, and
it's not gonna work. Angie's with me.

- Hey, she's my friend too.
- Well, she and I are more than friends.

- Oh, really? Have you slept with her?
- That's none of your business.

Oh, my God, you haven't.
I was just taking a shot in the dark.

No, that's your sex life.

If you haven't slept with Angie,
it's a level playing field.

- You think so?
- I do.

Oh, hey. What are we doing?

- We're going upstairs.
- Okey-dokey.

Good night, Alan.

Good night.

Hey, Al?

- Morning.
- What's good about it?

I didn't say good.

Hey, why aren't you studying
for your test?

I thought we settled this, Dad.

Turn off the TV,
go to your room and study.

- You'll never learn.
- Hey, hey, I heard that.

- So?
- So I'm an adult.

I don't have to learn anything.

What's bugging you, zippy?

Your blow-up doll
ran off with the pool toy?

Just mind your business and do your job.

Wanna rephrase that?

Desperately.

- Good morning, everyone.
- At least somebody's in a good mood.

Well, I'm not usually one to kiss and tell,
but:

So who's the lucky receptacle?

Do not talk about Angie that way.
She's a lady.

During the day.

But once the lights go down:

- All right, fine. We get the picture.
- Oh, I don't think you do.

She left an hour ago, but it took me
till now to safely zip up my pants.

You know, there are parts of Angie
that could sue Disneyland...

...for claiming
it's the happiest place on Earth.

Oh, go to hell.

- Alan, Alan, wait.
- What?

Hi, is Charlie here?

Oh, for God's sake.
They just drop out of the sky for him.

- Tricia?
- Hi, Charlie. Can I talk to you?

I guess. What's up?

I've made a horrible mistake.
I can't marry Jeremy.

- Who's Jeremy?
- Angie's son.

I thought I wanted to settle down.

But when I saw you the other night,
I realized I'm not over you.

Okay, you understand that I'm involved
with Jeremy's mother, right?

Well, I know, but I don't understand.

You're not alone.

I'm so confused. I just had to see you.

Oh, come on, come on.
It will be all right.

Can I get you anything?
Something to drink?

- Could I have a glass of water?
- Sure.

- Here, sit down.
- Thank you.

Alan, where do we keep the water?

Kitchen.

- Back in a flash.
- "Where do we keep the water?"

Hey, I know where the Scotch is, I know
where the ice cubes are. That's enough.

Okay, let me get this straight.
Angie's son is engaged to that woman...

...who you used to be involved with,
who now wants you back?

Scorecards, you can't tell the players
without the scorecards.

- Yeah, what am I gonna do?
- I know what I'd do.

Yeah, three pumps and an apology.

What? You got another move
I ain't heard about?

Okay, forget about what I'd do.
That woman is gorgeous.

- How could you possibly pass that up?
- Easy. I care about Angie.

Forget about Angie.
You don't need Angie.

You're trying to sabotage
my relationship so you can have Angie.

What? No, no, no.

No.

Come on, look at her.
She's young, needy and vulnerable.

Go fetch.

No, no, it's not worth it. I'm not
gonna screw things up with Angie.

Who's gonna tell her?
I'm not gonna tell her.

- That's not the point.
- Okay, think about this.

In a few years, Tricia will be what?
Twenty-nine?

Angie's gonna be 60.

You're looking at grandkids, liver spots
and a dusty bowl of hard candy.

- I don't like any of those.
- Of course you don't, nobody does.

Go ahead. Do it.

Defile her.

- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.

Listen, Tricia.

You know how I feel about you.
We had some great times together.

- Remember Vegas?
- Oh, yeah.

- We didn't leave the room for three days.
- Oh, yeah.

Of course, I couldn't leave
because I made you tie me to the bed.

Oh, yeah.

Do you ever hear
from the other two girls?

Oh, yeah.

Look, this isn't a good idea.
You need to go.

But can't we just talk a little more?

If we could just talk,
you wouldn't need to go.

- Wait... But, Charlie...
- Trust me.

Jeremy is a great guy.

And he obviously loves you.
I say give him a chance.

But what if you and I
had just one last fling?

One last fling?

Yeah, yeah, we'll go back to Vegas.
This time, I'll tie you up.

You really need to go.

- But Charlie, wait, wait...
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

It's not too late.

- You can still have her.
- I'm not listening.

You could do it in her car.
How hot is that?

- I can't hear you.
- It's dirty in a car.

- What the hell do you want?
- What?

Tricia broke off her engagement
with Jeremy because of you.

No, no, no.

- I was good. Honest.
- He was crushed.

My little boy had a nervous breakdown
and tried to drink bleach.

Yeah, but I was good.

Oh, good. Tricia told us everything
about you and her.

Everything? And he was still crushed?

You lied to me.

No, no, no, I didn't lie. I just didn't tell.

It was a long time ago.

And I didn't want you to be jealous
because she's young and you're...

- I'm what?
- A real trouper?

Drop dead.

But I was good.

- Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.
- You did. You warned me.

- But did you listen?
- No.

- Do you ever listen?
- No.

- Are you listening now?
- No.

So you're just gonna sit there
and feel sorry for yourself?

No, I'm also gonna drink.

Oh, come on, Charles. This isn't
like you. Apart from the drinking.

- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to do what you always do.

Pick yourself up, dust yourself off,
call one of your little whores.

Mom, have you ever considered
trying to be nurturing and supportive?

When have I ever been anything else?

Right. I don't know what I was thinking.

Oh, it's okay.
I've had a lifetime of being hurt by you.

At this point, I'm just one big scab.

Where have you been?

I figured since you weren't seeing
Angie anymore, I'd stop by and say hello.

- And?
- She's a really mean drunk.

Well,
as I was trying to tell your brother...

...single women that age
are notoriously unstable.

What? I'm nowhere near her age.

Hey, Grandma, guess what?
I'm gonna be in eighth grade next year.

Really? Is this a move forward?

- Yes.
- Yes.

Then congratulations.

Next stop, clown college.

There's a college for clowns?

Okay. Clown junior college.

Resynced by Ubolena.

.......... ********** ..........

Look at him. He can type 80
words a minute with his thumb,

but he can't pee without
hitting the shower curtain.

Fortunately, typing is a
job skill and peeing is not.

Oh, dude, WTF?

- Oh, geez.
- What?

That woman over there.
We used to go out.

Did it not end well?

It went fine for me.

Although, in retrospect,

I guess I could have handled our parting with a
little more tact and sensitivity and a little less,

you know, banging her best friend.

Oh, God!

Hey, hey, her friend was a double-jointed
sex freak with daddy issues--

what was I supposed to do?

You're right. Your hands were tied.

That, too.

So, how long ago was this?

Her or the friend? 'Cause
there was a brief overlap.

Let's go with her.

I don't know. Eight, nine years.

So maybe she's over it.

Or maybe not.

t, here's the plan.

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

You count to ten, then scream like a girl
and start giving Jake the Heimlich maneuver.

Don't be ridiculous.

Charlie?

Okay, but if she reaches into her purse,
I'm using numbnuts as a human shield.

Hey, Chrissy. Long time.

I know.

Yep, long, long time.

Yeah.

Time is a great healer, isn't it?

Of some things.

Hey, congratulations on your new career.

Thank you.

It's hard to believe Charlie
Harper is a children's singing star.

Well, you know how much I love kid...

Yep, a long, long time.

Looks like your little guy enjoys music.

Oh, yeah, he loves it.

He's actually quite
the piano player, too.

Piano? You hear that, Charlie?

The young man plays piano just like you.

Lots of kids play piano.

So, you still living in Westwood?

Yeah. Still there.

We just drove down to
spend the day at the beach.

Oh, sure. The beach.

Nice place to visit, but you
wouldn't want to live there.

Actually, I do live
there; it's not that bad.

Right. Well, we should get
going. It was nice seeing you.

Nice to see you, too.

Come on, Chuck.

Chuck.

I heard it.

Lots of kids named Chuck.

It's a nickname for Charles, isn't it?

So are Chaz, Chad, Chick and
Charlie. What's your point?

No point.It's just that you haven't
seen that woman in nine years,

and little Chuck is, uh...

Well, how old do you
suppose little Chuck is?

What difference does it make?

Well, I'd say little Chuck is, uh...

seven or eight years old,
give or take nine months.

What are you implying?

'Cause I don't know what
you're talking about.

You don't?

Okay, I choose not to.

JAKE: Oh, crap! Dad,
quick, we gotta go home!

Why, what's wrong?

My battery died.

Oh, no, wait. I just
turned it off by accident.

This wouldn't happen
if I had a smartphone.

Do I even need to say it?

So is it just me or did that kid
kind of look like Uncle Charlie?

* And the cat's in the cradle *

* And the silver spoon *

* Little boy blue and
the man on the moon *

Shut up, Alan.

* When you coming home,
Dad? I don't know when...*

It's not funny.

Well, maybe not funny ha-ha,
but certainly funny hee-hee.

That boy was nothing like me.

Well, he didn't have ear hair and whiskey
breath, but I'm guessing he'll grow into that.

What's going on?

Well, it would appear that
the ol' spermonator here...

has fathered a child.

I did not.

How can you be so sure?

'Cause I never play in the rain
without a slicker and galoshes.

I'm confused. Where do the galoshes go?

It's just a figure of speech.

Everything that needs to be covered is covered
when, you know, covering is appropriate.

I didn't ask for your life story.

I was just confused about the galoshes.

You know, Charlie, even
condoms are only 98% effective.

That's not true.

The hell it isn't.

Haven't you ever read the package?

Who reads the package?

It's not like a cereal box.

You don't read it while you're eating.

Yikes.

Come on, Charlie, do the math.

You haven't seen the woman in nine
years and she's got an eight-year-old.

So what?

You showed up at my door with a ten-year-old
and I hadn't seen you in 11 years.

Does that mean taterhead
is our love child?

All right, fine, stay in denial.

There's no way little Chuck is your son.

Chuck?

Hey, hey, lots of kids are named Chuck,
play the piano and look disturbingly like me.

He's right.

In fact, I'm surprised we're
not up to our asses in 'em.

Hey, Russell?

I'm busy.

I've got a question about these condoms.

I told you, Charlie, I'm giving
you the best bulk rate I can.

I know, but that's not what I was...

There's just no way I can
compete with the big chain stores.

I understand.

So I make it up in personal service.

I'm sure you do.

I mean, I'm not going to unroll the
damn things and put 'em on for you,

but short of that,I've got your back.

And I appreciate it.

But that's not what I was asking about.

Charlie, times are tough.

People don't get their drugs from their
friendly neighborhood pharmacist anymore.

They go on the Internet.

I know.

Sure, trust your mailman with your
heart medicine and stool softeners.

Russell, have you been
hittin' the free samples again?

What are you, a cop?

No, I'm just a little
concerned about you.

Well, if you're so concerned,
help me out a little bit.

Why don't you buy some reading glasses
or a neck brace once in a while.

- Sure, whatever.
- A bag of Skittles for God's sake.

You know, 'cause my margin
on condoms is bubkes.

Yeah, well, speaking of condoms,

I just want to know if somebody could get
pregnant even if you were wearing a condom.

Have you been talking to
the Wetzel's Pretzels lady?

Because I just gave her
a ride home, that's it.

No, no, no, no, I mean in general.

What are the odds that
a condom wouldn't work?

Well, there are a number
of things to factor in.

Oh, cough syrup?

I don't have a cough.

Neither do I.

Anyway, condoms.

Whenever you're dealing
with a manufactured product,

there's always going to
be flaws in the process.

Yeah, but aren't they supposed to
be tested before they go out? Or in?

Well, sure, but they
don't test every one.

They don't?

Masturbating's looking
better and better, huh?

Okay, okay, so bottom line, what you're
saying is even if I'm wearing a condom,

there's a chance I could
get someone pregnant?

Did you miss eighth grade
health class, Charlie?

Oh, come on, who went to health class?

Well, amongst others, a certain
self-medicating pharmacist

who pays alimony to
three different women,

but not one penny in child support.

All right, all right, for future
reference, what about lambskin?

Are they more effective?

Well, um, less so than
your latex product.

Now I had to stop wearing them myself because
something about the smell made my cat go berserk.

It kind of a cute story.

I don't... I don't want to hear it.

Not a cat person, huh?

I'm not either anymore.

All right, well, thanks,
Russell. I'll see ya.

Th-Th-That's
it?

You're not going to buy anything?
We've got Wiffle ball bats.

Maybe your little bastard
would like a Wiffle ball bat.

Childproof.

You all right?

No, I am not.

What's going on?

Alan, I have always conducted my sex
life according to three simple principles.

One: if at all possible, ladies first.

Two: it's easier to be
forgiven than ask permission.

And third, and most important:

the ten seconds it takes to put on a condom beats the hell
out of the ten years you have to pretend to like soccer.

Except when they don't work.

Stupid tiny disclaimer
on the side of the box.

They should put it in big letters
right on the reservoir tip.

Do you feel lucky, dumb ass?

Yeah, that'd do it.

So, what's your next move?

Well, you'd think if Chrissy had
my child and decided not to tell me,

I'd just send her a little card.

You know, "Thanks for being
a good sport" or something.

I'm not sure Hallmark has
a deadbeat dad section.

It doesn't matter.

For some reason, I
want to know the truth.

If I have a kid, I
need to know about it.

Of course you do.

Being a father is the
greatest joy there is.

Hey, Dad, where's the plunger?

Uh, laundry room.

Thanks, I over-wiped.

No such thing, my son.

Where was I?

The joys of fatherhood.

Right.

What? There was a time
when he didn't wipe at all.

Hey, I'm gonna need a mop, too.

Excuse me. Father/son moment.

* People, let me tell
you about my best friend *

* He's a warmhearted person
Who'd love me till the end *

* People, let me tell
you about my best friend *

* He's one boy cuddly toy My
up, my down, my pride and joy *

* People, let me tell you
about him, he's so much fun *

* Whether we're
talking man-to-man *

* Or whether we're
talking son-to-son *

* 'Cause he's my best friend *

* Yeah, he's my best friend...*

Daddy's home!

Hurry! Hurry!

Hey, Jake?

Don't worry. It's all cleaned up.

Not why I'm here.

You can hardly smell it at all anymore.

Don't kid yourself.

Although I may owe you a toilet.

I'll put it on your tab.

Now, I want to ask you a question.

Crumb cake, a frappuccino
and a burrito supreme.

That's not the question.

Oh, yeah, and a tangerine.
That's what killed me.

Are you done?

I hope so, 'cause the
toilet won't flush anymore.

What-What I wanted to ask you is do
you think I've been a good role model?

Are you kidding?

You drink, you gamble, you have different
women here practically every night.

You're the best role
model a guy could want.

You think so?

Yeah, they should put
your face on money.

Well, thanks, buddy.

I appreciate it.

Oh, hey, one more question.

How would you feel
about having a cousin?

I've got a cousin.

I mean, another cousin.

What do I need another cousin for?

Forget it.

What I need is a
smartphone and a new toilet.

Cousin.

Charlie.

What are you doing here?

Well, I was in the neighborhood.

I thought I'd stop by and
say hello and bring you this.

A Wiffle ball bat.

That's for Chuck.

I got you an eyeglass repair
kit and some malted milk balls.

Thanks.

I know it's not much of a gift, but the guy
that usually sells roses at the freeway on-ramp,

well, he switched to oranges, and
I didn't know if you liked oranges.

So anyway, is Chuck my kid?

What difference does it make?

Well, it makes all the
difference in the world.

How?

Well, for starters, I'm gonna write a scathing
letter to a certain manufacturer of latex products.

But more importantly, if
I'm his dad, he should know.

He's already got a dad.

- Oh, really?
- Yes.

We may not live together anymore and
he may not have your kind of money,

but he's a good dad, and
he loves Chuck very much.

So you're just raising him on your own?

Charlie, you don't
have to worry about him.

He's gotten along just fine without you
for the last eight years and so have I.

But wait, Chrissy!

I didn't know!

Boy, you miss one health class.

So, Jake, how do you like high school?

I'm in eight grade.

I see.

When do you start high school?

Hard to say. Eighth grade
is really kicking my ass.

Jake, language.

Yeah, language, math,
science, history, phys ed.

I understand, dear.

I can't even find my locker.

All right, I talked to
her. You owe me five bucks.

He's a good wiper, and I love him.

Hey, Alan, I just spoke... aw, geez.

Good to see you, too, dear.

What's going on, Mom?

Nothing.

I merely stop in to see my two
sons and my one and only grandchild.

Well, it's...

So, Mom, you're looking good.

Did you have something
snipped or tucked or sucked?

Just eyes and tush. But
nice of you to notice.

Hey, Charlie, did you ever
find out if that kid is yours?

Thanks a lot, Berta.

Oh, dear, have I spoken out of turn?

Kid?

Yeah, well, it-it-it turns out that there
are flaws in every manufacturing process

and that includes your
everyday latex products.

I see. And how far
along is the young lady?

Oh, about eight years.

Eight years and she's
just suing you now?

She's not suing me.

She doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

Lucky you.

If I were her, I'd have owned half
this house before the pee stick dried.

Yeah, real lucky.

I got an eight-year-old son and I'll
never get to spend any time with him.

Oh, sweetheart, look, take it from me.

Spending time with one's
children is greatly overrated.

Oh, come on, face facts.

Some people are meant to be
parents and some people aren't.

And you have a perfect example of
that sitting right in front of you.

You certainly do.

Yeah, well, I think I'd be a great dad.

Well, easy for you to say now
that you've dodged the bullet.

You're right, talk is cheap.

Remind me to speak to him about
putting this house in my name

so it can never fall into the hands of
some money-hungry, manipulative bitch.

That isn't related to him.

What do you want now, Charlie?

Look, I can see why you might not
think of me as father material.

And clearly you've done a great
job raising Chuck on your own.

I'd just like, if you'd let
me, to help out a little bit.

This is more than a little bit.

Hey, eight years is a long time.

What do you want out of this?

I just want to know
that he's taken care of.

And I plan on sending
you a check every month.

I-I don't know what to say.

You don't have to worry
about me interfering.

Although, there's a couple of things
you should know for when he gets older.

Like what?

Well, you're gonna want to
lock the liquor cabinet...

But don't forget that mouthwash
can also pack a pretty good buzz.

So be on guard for
suspiciously minty breath.

Oh, and if his school nurse is at all
attractive, you can expect the occasional hernia.

Thanks for the heads up.

You're welcome.

So, uh,...

Good luck.

You're gonna need it.

Jeremy, your mom's here.

- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

Hey, where'd you get that shirt?

Oh, I got it for him.
I hope that's okay.

I love it.

He looks like a little ladies' man.

So, uh, is this time
next week okay for you?

Actually, I think my
babysitting days are behind me.

Ciao.

w2m really glad you're accepting
responsibility, Charlie.

Thank you.

You'll see. It's a great
feeling knowing you're...

you're taking care of your own kid.

Oh, hey, Mr. Harper.

- Hey, Clive, how's it going?
- Great.

All right, Mrs. Melnick, that
should hold you for a while.

- Hey, dude.
- Hey, dude.

Thanks, Clive, you're the best.

Come on in, honey. Thanks, Alan.

Bye, buddy.

Who was that guy?

Oh, that's Clive, the exterminator.

He's been coming here forever.

Hey, Alan, has it
ever occurred to you...

Hey, Mr. Harper.

Hey, Craig.

Has what ever occurred to me?

Nothing.

Hey, Mr. H. Long time no see.

Condos for sale

Thanks, Mom. This is
a perfect first job.

First job?

I think you're looking
at a birth of a career.

I was going to have him put up fliers,
but I didn't trust him with a staple gun.

How much are you paying him?

Obviously, too much. Look at him.

For the record, I promised
him $20 and a Playboy magazine.

Playboy?

Don't worry.

I'll Magic-Marker over
the ta-tas and hoo-hoos.

Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.

I should've hired a monkey.

You mean a different monkey.

********

Well, it's not really a paycheck, and he's
not really earning it and we don't call him...

I guess I got to give you Jughead.

I remember my first job.

Slaughterhouse.

Strippin' out sheep intestines
for the condom companies.

Not as sexy as it sounds.

I was a fluffer in a pet salon.

You know, with a blow dryer.

I was going a completely different way.

What are you doing?

Thanks to Grandma, I'm reading
an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.

Hey, Alan, you got any cash?

Yeah. Why?

I need to borrow some.

What for?

What are you, my mother?

Just give me a few bucks,
save me a trip to the ATM.

When will I get it back?

I don't know. Tomorrow.

Okay, how much do you need?

Just a couple hundred.

A couple hundred? Who carries
around that kind of money?

Well, let's see...

Strippers, bookies, prostitutes,
and not entirely coincidentally-- me.

Well, I've only got... 35, 36...38

That's it? That's your
walking around money?

It's the perfect amount
in case I get mugged.

See, not so little that my attacker will
get angry and try and pistol-whip me,

yet not so much that I would feel obliged to fight for
it and possibly be shot while wrestling for the gun.

- So you got $38.
- Yep.

Just out of curiosity, how much money would
it take for you to wrestle a gun from a mugger?

Assuming a small- to medium-
sized mugger, at least $40.

Fine, so, give me the $38.

- All of it?
- Why not?

Then I've got nothing.

And you think $38 changes that?

What if I decide to go
out and have some fun?

$38 worth of fun?

I wouldn't spend all of it.

Okay, okay, look, you're
not going out to have fun.

You never go out to have
fun, because you know why?

You're not a fun guy.

Oh, I am very much a fun guy.

We just have different
definitions of fun,

and mine doesn't include urinary
tract infections and dry heaving.

Just give me the money, ya big fruit.

$38...

If it had been $40, we'd
be wrestling, my friend!

Hey, Charlie?

You got my money?

Charlie!

I'm trying to sleep, Alan.

Yeah, well, I've got to go to work
and you said you'd have my money.

Oh, for God's sake.

You don't even have to get
up. Just tell me where it is.

Well, the last I saw any of it,

it was sandwiched between two of the loveliest
man-made breasts that ever smacked me in the eye.

Oh, Charlie, you say
the sweetest things.

Oh, Ginger, this is my
brother Alan. Alan, Ginger.

So bottom line, you don't have my money?

No.

The money you promised
to pay back today?

The day hasn't even started yet.

It started for me.

That's only because you're
on Douchebag Savings Time.

Can we please talk about this
when one of us doesn't have a warm,

firm buttock nestled against his groin?

Oh, dear Lord.

So you'll get it by tonight?

I'm hopin' to get it as
soon as you close the door.

Are you really out of cash?

Don't worry. I've got hooker money.

* When you're hungry at school *

* You need to know *

* Paste yes, boogers no.*

How was your day, darling?

Fine, except I had to pay for lunch
with my lucky Sacagawea dollar.

What kind of lunch can
you get for a dollar?

Two gas station hot dogs that were a year
old if they were a day, thank you very much.

Is Sacagawea the same Indian chick
that's on the Land O'Lakes butter?

I don't know.

I hope so.

I'd like to believe it is.

Okay, Charlie, I'm leaving.

Hang on. Let me pay you.

Here you go.

Did you forget I paid for
that pizza the other night?

Oh, right. How much was that?

Well, you got the garlic
balls too, so, say...

75 bucks.

You got change for a hundred?

Nope.

Okay, you'll pay me back.

Count on it.

Wait, wait, wait, as long as you're
doling it out, you got my 40 bucks?

Oh, sure.

- You got change for a hundred?
- Nope.

Okay, I'll catch you later.

Wait...

How come Berta can pay
you back and I can't?

Oh, grow up. She's
not gonna pay me back.

Okay, then, what about me?

What about you?

I want my $40.

I only borrowed $38.

Yeah, well, I find round
numbers easier to remember.

Oh, you like round numbers, do you?

Yes, I like round numbers.

Okay, here's a round
number for you. Zero.

Nice, tight circular shape.

Nothing gets in, nothing gets
out. Sound familiar, Alan?

Are you calling me anal?

That's right.
A-L-A-N, anal.

Okay, okay, okay. So, so bottom line, you're
not gonna pay me back. Is that correct?

Well, truth be told, I was gonna pay
you back, but your attitude irks me.

I irk you?

That's right. I find you irksome.

You're a big, fat irk.

Hey, hey, you borrow
$38, you owe me $38.

Yeah, well, you've been living in
my Malibu beach house for six years.

You owe me $1 million.

A million dollars?

That's a one followed by
six tight little sphincters.

You look tired.

Yesterday, I had a quarter tank of gas.

Today, I drive a mile into
Topanga Canyon and bang, empty.

There's no cell coverage up there, so I had to hump
all the way back down to the beach to call Triple-A.

Oh, that's a shame.

Shame, my ass. How the hell did a
quarter tank of gas disappear overnight?

It's a mystery.

Wait a minute... I smell gasoline.

Really?

I... I don't smell anything.

You have gas on your breath.

You siphoned my tank.

Oh, please.

You think I stuck a rubber
hose down your gas tank,

sucked on it until the gas ran out of your tank and
into mine thereby compensating me for the $38 you owe me?

That's preposterous.

Yeah... Yeah, you're right.

What was I thinking?

What are you doing?

Do me a favor. Say...
preposterous again.

You're crazy! Get that away from me!

Oh, come on. Come on.

Just for grins say, "Help
me. My head's on fire."

All right, all right, all right, I sucked
the gas out of your car! Now turn it off!

Okay, fine. Well played.
You got your money back.

actually...

at 473.9 cents a gallon, you had
only $13.22 worth in your tank,

so you still owe me $24.

- Get out.
- What?

Get out of my house.

You know what? I just might.

No, no, no, "might"
implies you have a choice.

Oh, so you're going to
throw me out over $24. 78?

No, I'm throwing you out because you're
a cheap, gas-sucking, flammable irk!

I am not cheap.

Leaving.

no one's fault, Jake.
These things just happen.

I don't know. They seem
to happen to you a lot.

Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?

Dad pissed off Uncle Charlie again.

Sorry to show up unannounced like this.

No problem. It's always good to see you.

He got kicked out again?

Damn it, Alan. What'd you do now?

I didn't do anything.

But I'm not going to be
staying at Charlie's anymore,

so I thought I should bring Jake's stuff
back here until I find a place of my own.

Fine. Good luck.

But it's nobody's fault.

I just think it's
time for me to move on.

Okay. Good night.

But FYI: Charlie's a thief, a liar
and I suspect something of a firebug.

Really? Hmm, he struck
me as a straight shooter.

Little loosey-goosey with the liquor and
the ladies, but all in all, a good fella.

In what universe is
Charlie Harper a good fella?

Well, I certainly don't know him as well
as you do, so I'll just shut my piehole.

Uh, anyway, here's the
rest of Jake's stuff.

I'll get you my new address
as soon as I have one.

You do that.

- So, where are you gonna stay till then?
- Piehole, Herb.

Oh, I don't know.

Things are a little tight right now,
so a hotel isn't really an option.

Maybe the Y for a couple of
days, you know, but we'll see.

I could sleep in my
office or... in the car.

Oh, well, you can't do that.

Piehole, piehole, piehole!

Come on, Judith, you can't
expect a man to sleep in his car.

You're good people. Just
let me just get a few things.

I'm sure it'll be fine. He's not the
kind of guy who'll overstay his welcome.

He's been at his
brother's for six years.

Uh, Herb, would you mind giving
me a hand with the NordicTrack?

Oh, sure.

Love you.

Hey, Charlie.

Oh, hey, Herb, what's up?

I came to pick up some stuff for Alan.

For Alan?

Yeah, he's staying with Judith and
I till he gets back on his feet.

Gee, Herb, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

but I've been waiting six years for that
khaki-wearing weasel to get on his feet.

Judith mentioned that...

using a lot of the same
words, interestingly enough.

Anyway, he wanted to avoid having a scene with
you, so he asked if I'd pick up some of his stuff.

And you agreed?

I had to get out of there, Charlie.

Okay, okay, fine. What do you need?

Quite a few things,
actually. He gave me a list.

Well, let him stay in there long
enough, he'll give you a bleeding ulcer.

Yeah, Judith said that, too.

Anyway, uh, melatonin, a mouth guard.

I guess he grinds his teeth at night.

I myself have restless legs syndrome.

But just the left leg.
Right leg sleeps like a baby.

What else, Herb?

Well, I also got apnea
and I tend to drool a lot.

- The list, Herb.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

Let's see, shower cap, loofa mitt and some
kind of little stool that elevates his feet

while he's sitting on the toilet.

What?

Yeah, apparently when the
morning coffee doesn't do the job,

having his feet up gives him that extra
leverage for a successful bowel movement.

You're kidding?

No. Look. For a successful BM.

That would mean "bowel movement."

Okay, fine.

Guest bedroom's right down there.

Hey, I just made a pitcher
of margaritas. You want one?

Oh, gee, I'll have to pass.

Judith's waiting for me to get
back, and she gets really steamed...

- Salt or no salt?
- Salt.

- Okay.
- You got it.

This is so weird.

It's just for a couple days,
Jake. Don't make a federal case.

You know this is probably
gonna affect my schoolwork.

How? It's not like your
grades could get any lower.

That's good, Alan.
Undermine his self-esteem.

You see what I have to
live with on weekends?

Nobody's talking to you.

Where's he gonna sleep?

I'm not a "he." I'm your father.

How'd you get to be my
father if you're not a "he"?

Go make up the couch.

What about the guest room?

That's not a guest room
anymore. It's Herb's train room.

His what?

He's a model train aficionado.

Aficionado?

He works hard. He deserves a hobby.

Sometimes he lets me wear the hat.

I begged you for years to let
me turn that into a game room.

Bumper pool, ping-pong, something.

- Oh, this is different.
- How?

Herb can play with his trains alone.

I'm sure he does plenty
of stuff in there alone.

- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

I got it.

This is so beautiful.

Yep.

Can I confess something, Charlie?

What's that?

I sometimes wonder
about the road not taken.

Which road is that?

Your road, Charlie.

It's a good road, Herb.

So it's not a matter of the
grass always seems greener?

No, no. No, the grass is
pretty frickin' green over here.

Damn!

It's me.

I hope so.

It's the road taken.

You're not gonna answer it?

Nah. Judith will just harsh my mellow.

Yeah, she's a mellow-harsher.

But I love her.

That's nice.

You know, in the boudoir,
we're very simpatico.

Glad to hear it.

On top of everything else, she actually
let me put my train set in her back room.

Damn cran-apple juice.

I should start wearing a diaper.

It's about time you got home.

Is that an apology I'm feeling?

Where's my husband?

Sleeping on the deck.

What? Why?

He's drunk.

Herb's not a drinker.

No argument there.

All right, here's how it's gonna go:

I am taking him home with me and
you're taking back your brother.

How 'bout this?

You and Alan patch things up
and I keep Stretch out there.

I'm kinda fond of the big lug.

Charlie, I'm in no mood.

- Not what I heard.
- What?

I don't have time for
this. Alan, get in here!

No!

Do not make me come get you!

Now... apologize to your brother.

Do it!

I'm sorry I made such a
big deal out of everything.

And?

And you can keep the $24.78

This was all about $24?

Plus he tried to set me on fire!

Afr you sucked my gas!

Hey, baby, when did
you arrive on the scene?

Just get in the car.

Look, poop stool.

I'm gonna need that.

You can pop a blood vessel
if you push too hard.

Words to live by.

Herb, car!

- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Herb.

- Bye, all.
- Bye, Herb.

This was fun. Let's do it again.

Now!

Kinda like old times, huh?

Judith kicking me out
and you taking me in.

You are taking me in, aren't you?

Give me one good reason why I should.

Uh, well... we're... we're family...

brothers.

We share blood and, and, and history.

We have a bond that unites us forever.

Nah. What else you got?

Okay. what about my French
toast? You like that.

You know, thick and fluffy with
cinnamon and powdered sugar.

- All right, you can stay.
- Really?

No.

Very funny.

Charlie?

You changed the locks?

I was only gone for six hours!

Charlie?

Oh, crap.

Here you go. Black, two
sugars. Double glazed.

- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

I can't believe Grandma fired me.

Well, the labor market's
very competitive these days.

There's always somebody brighter and
better and willing to work for less.

.......... ********** ..........

What are you doing?

What does it look like I'm doing?

I'd rather not say.

I'm trying to open these cinnamon buns.

Why?

I thought I'd try and
do a little baking.

You drunk?

A little bit.

Why is it child-proof? Are
kids o. d. 'ing on this stuff?

Have you considered
reading the instructions?

Ooh, listen to Mr. College Boy.

To open, strike sharply
on edge of counter. Really?

Really.

All right. I'll play along.

I christen thee H. M. S.
Kitchen Table. Godspeed.

I think we got a bad bun tube.

Gimme.

You just gotta know how to whack it.

I bow to your superior expertise.

So, how come you're all spiffed up?

I've got a date.

Oh, two nights in a row.

So, who's the glutton for punishment?

At the risk of tooting my own horn, I
am actually seeing two different women.

- Wow, two women.
- Yeah.

And yet you're still
tooting your own horn.

Hey, you know what's fun?

When you can talk 'em into
tooting each other's horns.

I'm not seeing them at the same time.

Well, that makes it more difficult.

But not impossible.

u put the icing on after it
comes out of the oven, right?

Right. Drizzle, don't squeeze.

Thus spake the whacker.

So, what prompted this
break from serial monogamy?

I don't know, I'm just tired of
putting all my eggs in one basket.

The basket being a woman?

Yes.

And the eggs being your bun tube?

No, see, the thing is, when I'm just dating
one woman at a time, if she dumps me...

When she dumps you.

Either way, I have to start
from scratch finding a new woman.

However, when I'm dating two
women, if one of them dumps me...

When one of them dumps you.

Either way, I'm not alone.

Wait a second. Wait a second.

You're saying that it's advantageous
to date more than one woman at a time?

Good Lord, man, you're a genius!

Yeah, ha-ha.

We must tell other men!

Okay, maybe I'm a
little late to the party.

A little late?

The girl already jumped out of the
cake and everybody's had a piece.

Well, late or not, I'm here.

And it turns out when it comes to 40-year-old, divorced
moms in the San Fernando Valley, I'm quite the catch.

I'm not surprised.

You're not?

Lights out at fat camp, a
jelly bean is steak tartar.

Hey, I'm single, employed,
disease-free, well-read,

cute as a bug and perfectly capable of
pretending to like other people's children.

Impressive.

Do these broads know that you're dipping
your chip in the salsa and the guacamole?

What?

You know, hittin' two
pinatas with one stick?

Toppin' off both tanks
with the same hose?

Throwin' your balls down two alleys?

Still don't get it?

No, I got it. And, uh,
and thank you. Um...

but no, they don't know.

These are divorced Valley moms trolling for
a new schmuck to replace the old schmuck.

And you let them think
that might be you?

It's not like I have to lie.
Look at me-- I scream schmuckdom.

They're rising. It's a miracle.

Yes, the miracle of yeast. I gotta go.

Go, my son.

Drizzle thy frosting on the
divorced sticky buns of the Valley.





<font color="#ffff00">Two And A
Half Men Season04 Episode03</font>

You're a great cook, Uncle Charlie.

It's no big deal.

Those chefs on TV act like they're
curing leprosy or something.

Can you make meat loaf?

Does it come in a tube?

No-- God-- it
comes on a plate.

Can I have some of that?

Beer? No.

Why not?

Because when you're 14, you
don't ask your uncle for beer.

Who do I ask?

I don't know...

try hangin' outside a liquor store and look for a
guy wearing house slippers and talking to himself.

What's his name?

You can't have any beer, Jake.

Man, I thought you were cool.

I am. And you know what makes me cool?

The fact that your opinion
means less than squat to me.

How old were you when
you had your first beer?

13... two...

Yeah, right.

Listen, we're not talking about
me. We're talking about you.

What about me?

Well, it's like this: Alcohol is for people
who can afford to lose a few brain cells.

Yeah? So?

I rest my case.

What case?

Morning, buddy. How
do you like your eggs?

In an Easter basket.

Scrambled it is.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Whatcha doing?
- Cooking breakfast.

How do you like your eggs?

Sunny side up.

Scrambled it is.

Cooking for Dummies.

No offense, Jake. I'm
actually cookin' for everybody.

What brought this on?

I Don't know. I... thought
I'd expand my horizons a bit.

What?

I'm just trying to figure out how
scrambled eggs are gonna get you laid.

You and me both.

I got it!

Hello?

Oh, hi, Stephanie.

Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I
had a great time, too.

Yes, it-it was special.

I-I don't usually do that
on a first date either.

Thank you for letting
me do that, by the way.

- Tonight? Oh, gee.
- Hey, Alan!

- How do you like your eggs?
- Uh, uh, one sec.

Charlie, Stephanie wants to see me tonight, but
I already made a date with Katie. What do I do?

Scrambled it is.

Uh, uh, the thing is, uh, I already made plans,
uh, with my, uh, you know, son, who I love dearly.

- What are we doing?
- Nothing. Go away.

Oh, oh, w-what are we doing?

Uh, uh, well, he and I have this, uh, this
father-son thing uh, where once a week, we...

- Rent go-karts.
- Rent go-karts.

And, uh... and, uh...

- Eat pizza.
- And eat pizza.

- And, uh...
- And drink beer.

And drink... Go away!

and, and drink, uh, uh, a lot of water,
which the body needs to, uh, to stay healthy.

Um, anyway, we-we're
on for Saturday, right?

Uh, okay, uh, uh, great, great.
Good. I-I'll see you then. Okay, bye.

- We're not going
go-karting, are we? - No.

You're using me for your
own purposes, aren't you?

Here's $20.

Hey, Alan. Taste these.

Why does it smell like bourbon?

The book said "season to taste."

Just kidding. I spilled.

N-No, thank you.

Suit yourself.

A little too much egg.

Jake, let's go!

I told your mother I'd
have you back by 7:00.

Hey, Alan, Alan, Alan.

Would you taste my hollandaise sauce?

You made hollandaise sauce?

You tell me.

You did not make hollandaise sauce.

Damn you, eggs Benedict.

Charlie, why are you doing this?

Doing what?

In the six years that
I have been living here,

the only time I've seen you turn
on the stove was to light a cigar.

Yeah, well, people grow, people change.

People get drunk while
watching the Food Network.

Jake, let's go!

Uh, I may not be back till late-- I'm planning
on giving my rose to bachelorette number two.

Only you could gay up bangin' two women.

Says the man in the apron with
the curdled hollandaise sauce.

So you admit it is hollandaise sauce?

Mom said you could drop me off
at Gabe's house so we can study.

Are you really gonna study?

- Sure.
- Great.

See that? He respects
me enough to lie to me.

Hey, Alan.
Speaking of lies--

at some point, one of these broads is gonna ask you
a question for which you will have no ready answer.

Like what?

Well, it could be as simple as:
"What did you do last night?"

or as tricky as: Why is there
a pasty stuck to your testicles?

The point is, you need to be careful.

So you're gonna teach
me how to lie to women?

Well, do you know enough to pull the
pasty off and say "Happy Anniversary"?

I do now.

Another thing you need to remember is always
answer a question with another question.

- What do you mean?
- Exactly.

- What?
- Great, you're all set.

- Drunk again?
- Yep.

Well, thank you. I
appreciate the advice.

I've got more.

Charlie, please don't take this the wrong way,
but if a semi-functioning wino, such as yourself,

can date several women at the same
time, I'm quite certain I can handle two.

Why would I take that the wrong way?

Tastes like stale ass.

Is it just me or does this thing we
have feel really, really comfortable?

Oh, yeah.

I mean, you know, maybe not pet-names-
for-our-pee-parts comfortable,

but we're certainly getting there.

Oh, hey, next week, my ex is taking
my daughter to see his parents,

so you and I can spend
the whole weekend in bed.

That-that sounds great.

I'll leave myself alone till then.

Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait--
uh, uh, next weekend?

Uh, you know, uh, I'll have to check, but I-I-I
think Saturday is a-a working Saturday for me.

Oh, no. Really?

Yeah, yeah, it's unfortunate,
but in today's economic climate,

Saturday is no longer the Sabbath for anybody
except perhaps very religious Jewish people.

You know, the guys with
the beards and the hats?

Did you see Yentl? I love that movie.

That's one I wouldn't mind owning.

Alan, are you seeing another woman?

Charlie, are you seeing another woman?

Why would you ask me that?

I just need to know I can trust you.

ah, well, trust is a two-way street.

I know.

Do you?

Because without trust,
all we have is sex.

Well, you can trust me, Charlie.

God, I hope so.

I've been hurt before.

I won't hurt you. I promise.

Okay, then.

Another woman?

Yeah.

You think I'm involved
with another woman?

Yeah.

You actually think I'm seeing someone
else at the same time I'm seeing you?

Yeah.

How did you know?

Do you need to get that?

Are you crazy?

Hey, it's Charlie. Do your
thing when you hear the beep.

Hey, Uncle Charlie, it's
me, Jakey. I'm drunk.

How are you? Are you with a
girl? Does she have big ones?

Jake, where are you?

What mall?

They all have pretzel
stands, you doofus.

Okay, you stay right where
you are, and I'll come get you.

We'll talk about that later.

They're big enough.

I love you too, buddy.

Yeah, we have shared some good memories.

Okay, I'm hanging up now.

Do you have to go?

No, we got time.

What the heck took you so long?

Believe me, I came
as quickly as I could.

What is that?

It's a pretzel. You want some?

No, thanks.

It's got jalapenos!

Oh, you're gonna regret that.

- What do you mean?
- You'll see.

Where'd you get the booze, knucklehead?

I did what you told me to do.

Me and Gabe gave money to
a creepy guy to buy us beer.

Oh, Jake.

His name was Satellite Jack.

He said the government
stole his kidneys.

Is $20 too much for a six-pack?

Not when a guy with no kidneys named
Satellite Jack is buying it for you.

Where'd you get the $20?

It was a bribe from my father.

You're kidding.

I know. For a cheap guy, he
can be surprisingly generous.

That's true.

Deep down I love him.

And I love you, too.

Great. Everybody loves everybody.

So, where's your friend?

Gabe? He ditched me when I started
throwing up, the bat rastard.

- Get out of the car.
- What?

I just had it detailed--
get out, get out, get out.

All right, but I'm tellin'
ya I'm all done throwin' up.

I see what you mean
about those jalapenos.

Listen, my mom still thinks I'm studying at Gabe's
house, so I don't think I should go home at this time.

What do you expect to do?

I don't know. You up
for an R-rated movie?

Boobies, no violence.

Step away from the car.

- Nope, false alarm.
- Wait for it.

Wait for what?

Oh, how about that?

You get any on your shoes?

A little.

There's a plastic bag in the trunk.

Remove your shoes and place them in the bag,
then seal it and put it back in the trunk.

Okay.

- Then climb in after it.
- Okay.

- Alan?
- Surprise.

I thought you were with
your son go-karting.

Yeah, listen, um, I lied about that.

But I can't lie anymore.

I was with another woman, but
all I could think about was you.

I'm a one-woman man and,
baby, you're that woman.

MAN: Who is it, honey?

Just a salesman. Go away.

Wait a minute-- are
you seeing someone else?

Get lost!

I-I thought we had something special.

Who's in there? Are you married?
Because I really thought...

You know, your body's
sending you a message.

Yeah, it's sayin' I really
should chew my food more.

Look at that shrimp. You could
wash it off and rve it again.

Your body is also telling
you that alcohol is poison.

If it's poison, why do you drink it?

Because there are things
inside of me I need to kill.

You can't kill bad feelings
with alcohol, Uncle Charlie.

Right.

And you can't stuff your
emotions with cupcakes.

Believe me, I've tried.

I'm sure you have.

And if you ever need to talk about
any of this stuff, I'm here for you.

Good to know.

Whoa, felt that one in my nuts.

ALAN: Hello? Anybody home?

Are you gonna rat me out?

Jake, buddy, how could
you even ask me that?

Hey, what's goin' on?

Jake took the 20 bucks you gave
him and got drunk with a friend.

Bad boy.

So... how 'bout a beer?

Never... again.

Me neither.

You know what the problem is?

The women, the drinking...

You guys look at me
and you think it's easy.

But what you don't see is all the years
of hard work and dedication it took

to make me the happy-go-lucky,
drunken, ass-wrangler I am today.

Charlie?

Oh, sorry, baby, I had
a little family drama.

Remember, you said if I gave you what
you want, you'd give me what I want.

Oh, right--
breakfast in bed.

How do you like your eggs?

Scrambled.

Yes!

You know, young man,

if I hadn't have been
electrocuted earlier this evening,

you and I'd be having a
serious talk right now.

Yeah. Hold on.

.......... ********** ..........

I really appreciate you getting up so early and driving me to work.

I owe you one.

You owed me one when I didn't smother you in your crib.

Well, then, I owe you two.

My car will be out of the shop in a couple of days.

There was a terrible knock in the engine.
Like a...
like a...

I kept saying, "Come in," but nobody did.

Ooh, carpool lane-- that's us.
We could...

- Shut up.
- Right.

It's 7:00.
Where are all these damn people going?

I know, right?
I deal with that every day.
Very frustrating.

Sometimes I dream about buying a cabin in the woods and just getting away...

- I said shut up.
- Yes, you did.

The people going that way should just switch jobs with the people going this way,

and everybody can leave their freaking cars in the garage.

You know, that's a...
that's a hell of an idea.
Right on.

- Don't patronize me.
- Sorry.

Wait a minute.
How are you getting back to Malibu?

Uh, I...
I was, uh...

- I was hoping...Charlie.
- No.

Take the bus.

There's no bus from Tarzana to Malibu.

Then, take a series of buses.

And don't get stuck on having to end up in Malibu.

Charlie, come on.
It...
it's just for a couple of days.

That's what Mom said when she brought you home from the hospital.

Good one.

You're a very funny man, Ollie.

You certainly are.

It's Laurel and Hardy.

Boy, they used to...
they used to get in some wacky jams, huh?

What about, uh...
uh, Abbott and Costello?

"Hey, Abbott!"

Or, uh...
or, uh, Martin and Lewis?

"Hey, lady, with the flavin' and the mavin' and the wow."

Three Stooges?
"Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."

Whoa, what...
why are we stopping?

Oh, a wise guy...

Okay, I don't mind the good-natured brotherly punching, but you did not have to twist my nipples.

You're lucky I didn't rip them off and feed them to you.

Um, you know, if you...

if you really have to go to the bathroom, there's, uh...

there's one right down the hallway.

What's wrong with the one in your office?

Uh, it's not really for guests.

Neither is my house.

Um, you know, I think we're out of paper towels.

I'll wipe my hands on you.
Get out of the way.

Morning, Dr. Harper.

Morning, Melissa.

Hello, Melissa.

You rat bastard.

*******

Good to know.

Hi, I'm Charlie, Alan's brother.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

Thought you had to tinkle.

Go away.

So, how long you been working for my baby brother?

About six months.

Wow, he's been keeping you a secret for six months?

Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?

There's no reason to thank me for the ride again, Alan.

Mi Mercedes, su Mercedes.

It's what brothers do when one is vastly more fortunate than the other.

Seriously, we need to talk.

Excuse us.

Charlie, she is the best receptionist I have ever had.

I'm hoping to say the same.

Come on, Charlie, please do not crap where I work.

Hey, you crap where I live.

So tell me about her.

There's nothing to tell.
She's a...
she's a terrific employee.

She does my scheduling, my books.
My patients love her.

She keeps the whole operation running like clockwork,

and she does it all for crappy pay and no benefits.

So you're not hitting that?

No, I'm not hitting that.

And even if I were hitting that, I wouldn't use the phrase, "hitting that."

It's a violent image for a beautiful act.

Yeah, yeah...
so the coast is clear?

No, the coast is not clear.

The coast is foggy and strewn with dangerously pointy rocks.

Can I get either of you a cup of coffee?

- Sure.
- No.

No for both of us.
Please leave.

All right.

- Bye, Melissa.
- Bye, Charlie.

Hope I see you again.

Oh, you'll see me tonight when I come back to pick up your boss.

Oh, oh, no, Charlie, Charlie, you don't have to make that long drive.
I'll take the bus.

I thought there were no buses.

If I have to, I'll charter one.

Why don't I just give you a ride home?

Oh, that is so sweet of you.

You got a real gem here, Alan.

Tell you what, when you get him home, there will be a cold margarita waiting for you out on my deck.

Which overlooks the ocean.
On the beach.
In Malibu.

That sounds wonderful.

It's really not: it's chilly, damp, and covered with pelican poop.

That's why he'll never win the Malibu slogan contest.

See you tonight, Melissa.

Bye, Charlie.

Have a great day, bro.

- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

Gee, your brother is really cute.

As a bug.

Bathroom?

Oh, let me give you the key.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

You are a doll.

You are cute.

She's actually a doll.

I wonder if she's anatomically correct.

Who's the Smurf?

The Smurf is my receptionist.

You're letting Charlie hit that?

Okay, look, first of all, that is a very ugly phrase.

And second of all, I'm not letting him.

I mean, short of drugging him and dumping him in the woods, what can I do?

Yeah.
He is like an Alabama bloodhound once he gets a whiff.

Now it's just a matter of waiting until it blows up in my face.

And after it blows up in my face, it will then circle around and bite me in the ass.

That's me.
No face, no ass.

Well, that's what you get when you mix work and personal.

Which is why me and Charlie have always kept everything strictly professional.

Yeah, yeah, I've often wondered about that.

When I first started to work here, I laid down the law: looky, no touchy.

Yipes.

All right, I'll make you another, but you got to promise not to chug this one.

Promise!

What a fun gal.

Charlie, do you know how hard it is to find a decent receptionist?

Well, kudos, bro, you did a great job.

Thank you, and I-I really don't want to lose her.

Why would you lose her?

Oh, gee, I don't know.

Maybe because my brother intends to defile and discard her like a warm melon.

A warm melon?

Nothing.

Anyway, my point is that you're gonna leave her with bad memories

that can only be erased by removing herself from anything that reminds her of you--

like me.

Is that what you're worried about, Bunky?

Yes, that's what I'm worried about.

What did you think I was worried about?

What else would I be worried about?

Well, let's see.

Your receding hairline, your semi-literate son, your budding man-boobs.

But that's just off the top of my head.

Charlie, please, I am begging you.

Look, I understand your concerns, but it's not like that.

I think Melissa is terrific.

You always think they're terrific.

They're terrific before.
They're terrific during.

It's the after when the crying and the quitting start.

Why is it always about you?

Aren't I entitled to some happiness?

You've had your share of happiness.

You've had your share of happiness, my share, everybody's share.

You've sucked the marrow of happiness from the...
bones of...

Oh, just leave her alone, won't you?

Alan, you don't have to worry.

You're thinking about the old Charlie, the old-hump-'em- and-dump-'em, one-track-mind Charlie.

Oh, oh, right, uh, the old Charlie from way back this morning.

I'm serious.
I honestly want to start building a relationship.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Get to know someone, let her get to know me, have something in common before we jump into bed.

Wow, I'm impressed.

That I'm growing up?

No, that you can so easily lie to my face.

You'll see.

It's gonna be different with Melissa.

I'm gonna take my time, form a friendship, bond emotionally,

and then and only then, take it to the next level.

98 minutes later...

Oh, Charlie!

You schmuck.

Morning, Dr. Harper.

Morning.

I like your jammies.

Thank you, I, uh, I like your...
thank you.

Guess you're kind of surprised to see me, huh?

Yeah, shocked.

Well, I hope you know it is not the kind of thing I usually do--

you know, hop into bed with a fella zippity-quick.

It's really none of my business.

Well, I don't.

But Charlie is so sweet and special.

Yep, he's a treasure.

Yeah, and this works out well for you.

Really?
Uh, how do you figure?

Since your car is still in the shop, we can carpool to and from work.

I see.
So, so you'll be coming back?

Oh, yeah.

Charlie asked me to stay the weekend.

- No kidding.
- Yeppers.

We really made a connection...

and it is not just physical.

Although the physical part is amazing.

Again, none of my business.

It is like I have known him all my life.

I know the feeling.
You get over it.

Hey, baby.

Hey yourself.

- Do I smell toast?
- You do.

Would you like a slice?

I can put butter and jelly on it.

Oh, d\j vu.

Stop it.
You're terrible.

Sorry, Dr. Harper.

That's okay.
I wasn't even listening.

I'm going to take a shower.

Hit the road in about 20 minutes?

- I thought you were going to call in sick.
- Shush.

He's kidding.

It's okay.
20 minutes is fine.

Great.

Alan, you know me as a cynical man,

but in just one night that little pixie has melted this cold, lonely heart.

You don't say.

You may not believe me, but there is something going on here,

and I really want to thank you for bringing her into my life.

I may not believe you?

You know what?
Fine.
Think what you want.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play Paul Bunyan takes a shower in Tiny Town.

Sorry we're running late.

That's all right.

Shower lasted a bit longer than I planned.

Yeah, well, uh, that happens.

I got to tell you, I am just crazy about your brother.

Swell.
Hope it works out.

How is a guy like that still single?

Well, he's always been a bit of a butterfly,

you know, fluttering through life, hard to pin down.

And being a fall-down drunk is kind of a speed bump for some of the ladies.

You're such a jokester, Dr. Harper.

Either that or put a gun in my mouth.

Oh, listen, on the way home tonight,

we have to swing by my apartment so I can get some clothes for the weekend.

And I'm gonna need a little extra time for lunch today.

I want to buy some sexy lingerie...

for you know.

I do.

Can I pick you up anything?

Yeah, yeah, um, ear plugs would be nice, um, and that gun I mentioned.

Nothing special.

I'm only going to use it just the once.

- Hi, Jake.
- Hey, got to hit the crapper.

You must be Judith.

I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

I'm Melissa, Dr. Harper's receptionist.

We talk on the phone all the time.

Oh, right, Melissa.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Alan!

Oh, oh, hey, hey, hi, uh, hi, Judith, this is Melissa.
Melissa, Judith.

It's not what it looks like.
Charlie's doing her, not me.

And, uh, where is Charlie anyway?

Taking a nap.

He says I drain him.

Isn't that adorable?

Adorable, disturbing, whatever.

Uh, thanks, I've got this.

- Your brother and your receptionist?
- What do you want from me?

Th-The Volvo's in the shop, he twisted my nipples and peed in my office.

What?

I'm not thrilled about this either, but what can I do?

You could think about the effect these shenanigans have on your adolescent son.

Okay, you know what, Judith?
I have enough problems.

If you're not comfortable leaving Jake here for the weekend, then take him home.

Nice try, Alan.

You think Uncle Charlie and Melissa are coming down for lunch?

I doubt it.

Can I have their chicken?

Knock yourself out.

You know how you always say I can ask you anything?

Yeah?

Is them being together weird for you?

No, no.

Well, you're a better man than I.

How so?

Well, you remember when Uncle Charlie was hittin' my fifth grade teacher?

Okay...

can we please stop calling it "hittin'"?

Well, I got another word, but I don't think you're going to like it.

Fine, fine, then I, uh, I do remember when he was...

hitting your fifth grade teacher.

That kind of bugged me.

Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

I mean, don't you think there should be boundaries?

I do think that.

But I thought you said it's not weird that he's hittin' your receptionist.

Ah, uh, w...
uh, well, pal, um, the thing is, um, Daddy lied.

Oh, then it is weird for you?

Yes, yes, it is weird for me.

Are you jealous?

Uh, no, no.

'Cause I was a little bit jealous about Miss Pasternak.

She had a rockin' bod.

Eat your chicken.

Melissa?
We, uh, need to get a move on.

A lot of traffic what with the rain and all.

- We need a minute, Alan.
- Oh, God.

What can they do in a minute that they didn't do all weekend?

You are just a selfish son of a bitch and you can go right to hell!

Sorry, Dr. Harper.
I'll be in the car.

Well...
that could have gone better.

I knew it.

I thought it might take longer than 48 hours, but I knew it.

A little sensitivity would be appreciated.
I'm hurting here.

I'm sure a lot of that is friction burn.

Where does that come from?

Where does it come from?

It comes from a long history of you using my life as a specimen cup.

Excuse me, but you're still talking about the old Charlie.

This Charlie was hoping to have a relationship of substance and depth.

By locking a stranger in your room and hittin' it for two days straight?

Okay, mea culpa.

Change is hard.

And now that I'm hearing it, I agree with you.

Hittin' it is an ugly term.

Don't change the subject.
What happened?

Nothing.

I just said to her that maybe we should slow things down, see other people.

Wait, y-y-you said this after the two days?

How could I know beforehand?

I thought you'd be happy.

You didn't want me to go out with her in the first place.

Yes, but it's no longer the first place.
It's the last place.

What can I tell you, Alan?

I made a mistake.

I rushed to love.

No, no, your mistake was you rushed to love my receptionist,

the woman who I depend upon to run my business.

Oh, she's a good kid.

She'll get over it.

You hear that?
You hear that?
Does that sound like a woman who's getting over it?

Well, Alan, the wounds are fresh.

You're going to need to be patient.

Why should I have to be patient?

Well, you have to work with her.

And it sounds like you'd better get going.

Sure you don't want to come back to my office and hump my fax machine?

You still have a fax machine?

You're despicable.

- Alan, wait.
- What?

Let me make it up to you.

How could you possibly make it up to me?

Well, I'm guessing she won't be inclined to bring you back here tonight.

So why don't you take a cab and I'll pay for it?

Thanks.
That makes up for everything.

I'm talking cab, not Town Car.

Oh, man.

Break-ups are so hard.

I do have a little friction burn.

That miserable son of a bitch.

Might want to extend your brake zone on the wet roads.

- I'm so stupid.
- No, no, no, no, you are not stupid.

You're, you're a dear, sweet, remarkably bright...

Truck, truck-- watch out for the truck.
Watch out for the truck.

- I want a raise.
- Sure, sure.

- And health insurance.
- That's a given.

I-I can't believe you don't have it already.

**********

*****

.......... ********** ..........

I can't believe you've been going to gym

all this time without a jockstrap.

I don't like it.

It feels like I'm flossing my butt crack.

Based on what I'm paying your dentist,

you know nothing about flossing.

Think of it as a bra for your balls.

Oh,now I want one.

What size are you?

How should I know?

I think they havone ofhose measuring things.

You know,like at the shoe store.

Length,width.

He's kidding,right?

Yes,he's joking,

Don't do that.

Here,"teen."

Think you can t your junk into that?

I'll make it fit. Let's just go.

No,no,put it on ||over your pants. We'll take a look.

The heck|| you will.

Charlie,you're embarrassing him.

Of course I am.

That's why I came.

Oh,sorry,sorry. Excuse me.

Charlie Harper?

|| Where? He owes me money.

Miss Pasternak?

Jake! Wow,look at you.

Look how much you've grown.

I reached puberty.

Oh,right,Miss Pasternak, fifth grade,

Woodward Avenue Elementary School.

o  Oh,yeah, Miss Pasternak!

Oh,yeah, Miss Pasternak.

So,are you still teaching?

No. No,I'm not.

|| How are you,Charlie?

Good,goodNice to see you. Long time.

You look terrific. Guess who's wearing a jock.

Oh,how nice.

Well,it's great to see you all.

Good-bye.

Bye,Miss Pasternak.

Dodged a bullet there.

I'll say.

She was kind of shook up after I broke it off with her.

Kind of shook up?

She went bananas and bit the gym teacher.

Where?

In the gym.

You miserable son of a bitch!

en I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul,

I gave you my bodyB@ and you just threw me aside

like I was some piece of garbage!

Yeah,my bad.

So,what's new?

Oh,you want to catch up?

Yeah,sure,let's catch up.

Let's see,um,well,okay, after you dumped me,

I had a nervous breakdown.

Well,it sure looks like you bounced back.

And then after my breakdown,

I got fired and blackballed from teaching.

Oh... bummer.

So,what are you up to now?

I'll tell you what I'm up to now.

I lost my house,I'm living in a cheap motel,

and my new career is giving lap dances to strangers

while I'm swinging by my crotch on a pole eight times a night.

Have you considered an athletic supporter?

Okay,well, thanks for thepdate.

Nice seeing you.

(hushed): Move,move,move.

You ruined my life, Charlie Harper!

Righto. Bye.

We didn't pay for the jockstrap. Just keep walking.

How can you live with yourself, you horrible evil man?!

He drinks.

Two And A Half Men S06E05

DeSto presents: A Jock Strap in Hell

What are you watching?

The Food Network.

I'm learning how

to prepare a cinnamon-apple cobbler.

Tired of being at the mercy of the dealers,huh?

What?

Nothing,nothing.

Listen,I think I owe you an apology.

For what?

You know,this morning in the drugstore?

Oh,yeah,the jockstrap jokes.

You should be sorry.

||No,not the jockstrap jokes.

Those were funny. I stand by those.

I meant the run-in with your old teacher.

You probably shouldn't have seen that.

I've seen worse.

Remember the Pilates instructor who threw

the lit road flare through your bedroom window?

Yeah. That was awesome.

That's one word for it.

Oh,and remember  the dental hygienist

who ot your ass up full of Novocain?

I do.

That was so funny.

You kept falling off the toilet.

Yeah,good times.

What do you do that gets these men so pissed off at you?

It's hard to say exactly.

I guess when a guy has an intimate relationship...

Oh,remember the girl from the tanning salon

who tried to shoot you with a bow and arrow?

Yeah,Jake.

My point is,I was wrong in the way I treated those women,

and you should learn a lesson from my mistakes.

You mean like keep a fire extinguisher by your bed?

Sure,that's one lesson.

An||d whenever a dental hygienist drops a quarter,

never bend over to pick it up?

Yeah,that,too.

And never go to a Halloween party

with a girl dressed as Robin Hood?

The thing is,Jake,

you wouldn't have to learn any of these lessons

if you always treated women better in the first place.

I'm confused. If I don't have to learn them,

why are you bothering me with them?

I don't know.

I'm sorry to take up your valuable time.

What the heck was that all about?

* Men. *

Hey. Guess what?

Turns out my kid's jockstrap is too small.

||Good news,eh?

Yeah,terrific.

Alan,let me ask you something.

Do you think I'm a horrible, evil person?

Yes.

||What? You are.

Thanks a lot.

Well,you know,not intentionally evil.

I mean,you know,

is a tornado evi when it picks up a mobe home

and flings it into an orphanage?

Is a shark evil

when it eats some poor schmuck on a boogie board?

Is a flesh-eating virus evil when it attacks...?

I get it,I get it,I get it.

I'm a malevolent force of nature.

Pretty much.

Is this ||about what happened with Jake's old teacher today?

She said that I ruined her life.

Well,she did choose to sleep with you.

How much of a life could she have had in the first place?

Don't try to make me feel better.

Because of me,the woman lost her teaching career,

and now she's dancing in this skeevy club in Van Nuys

and living in some fleabag motel.

How do you know what club she works at?

The clubs have Webites, the Web sites have pictures.

It's not rocket science.

Her dancing name is Desiree Bush.

Certainly more colorful than Delores Pasternak.

And presidential to boot.

I gotta tell you, I'm feeling a little glty.

Does that surprise you?

No,what surprises me is the liquor isn't helping.

It just beads up on the guilt and rolls right off it.

Oh,come on, this can't be the first woman

who had a nervous breakdown,

lost her job and wound up taking her clothes off

for horny strangers because of you.

Of course not.

But it's never bothered me before.

Well,maybe you're finally

developing a conscience.

At long last realizing that your actions have consequences

for other people.

Don't talk down to m Jiny Cricket.

Sorry.

But you're right

I do need to take responsibility for the damage I've caused.

Where you going?

Where else? Strip club.

Wait up. I'll drive.

* Men. *

("Cherry Pie" playing)

Good Lord, she's quite the gymnast.

I know. I never understood why this isn't in the Olympics

and synchronized diving is.

Hey,honey,when's Miss Bush come out?

Whenever Ben Franklin comes out.

I mean Desiree Bush.

She's around here somewhere.

Thank you.

How come she's not taking her clothes off?

Because this is a bikini club.

What's a bikini club?

Hard liquor,no nipples.

Man,I could've stayed home and seen no nipples.

Hey,there she is.

Miss Pasternak.

What the hell are you doing here?

I just wanted to talk to you.

Yeah,well,I'm working, so unless you want

a private dance, I got no time.

I don't need a dance. Then you get los

No,no,wait,wait,wait.

Alan needs a dance.

Oh,no,I don't,I-I...

|| I'm buying.

Do you mind if I take my belt off?

So anyway, I just wanted to tell you

that I'm really sorry for the way that I ended it,

and  there's anything I can do

to make it right, just let me now.

(groans deeply)

What can you do for me,Charlie?

Well,maybe I can help you get back on your feet.

Oh,oh,not yet,not yet.

Are you gonna get me my house back?

Are you gonna do that?

Ooh,doggies!

Well,no.

My parents have disowned me.

Are you gonna fix that relationship?

I'm not real good with parents.

Uh,excuse me,I've gotta, I've gotta readjust.

I'm playing ring toss with my car keys.

What then? Are you gonna get me my teacher's license back?

I wish I could.

Okay,I'm all set. We can continue.

Alan,this doesn't concern you.

At this point,it kinda does.

Come on, hop on Pop.

Thank you!

lf What if there was a way for you to go back to teaching

that didn't require a license?

What are you talking about?

Private tutoring for a special-needs child.

Oh,oh,Charlie, don't drag him into this.

Why not?

She's a good teacher, and if his grades go any lower,

we'll have to start renting him  out as a speed bump.

Tutoring?

Yeah,I don't know.

I'll match what you're making here.

Is it okay with you,Alan?

Oh,yes,yes,yes!

Okay,it's a deal.

Oh,thank you,thank you.

Now come on,teach.

I'll buy you a drink and we'll toast your new career.

(laughs): Great.

Uh,uh... O-O-Okay.

I'll,uh,I'll catch up with you guys later.

Let me get this straight.

She was his fifth grade teacher,

and then she became a stripper because you dumped her,

and now she's his tutor because you felt guilty?

Pretty much.

And you approved?

He caught me at a weak moment.

Well,who am I to judge?

I almost traded one of my kids for a riding lawn mower.

I'm sorry,but I'm still confused.

Oh,boy.

Hm. Okay,um...

let's look at it this way.

How about if you make $40 a dance.

If you want toind out how much you can earn per hour,

you have to solve for xd times 40,

X being the number of dances you can do in an hour.

What about tips?

That's a variable.

Oh. I get it-- so the money

|| you kick back to the house is...

The constant! The constant!

Good for you.

That's a good start.

Yeah,it was. You make learng fun.

(laughs): Where you going?

Take a shower.

Guys,we're done!

Hey. So,how'd it go?

Oh,a little slow.

He's not exactly the quicker picker upper.

Well,that's why he needs you.

He's kind of an idiot.

Yeah,uh,

I wasn't !gonna say anything, but wow.

So,we'll see you tomorrow,then?

Great. Hey...

! Charlie,thank you.||

For what?

Well,you've given me back

something I lost a long time ago.

I gave it back?

|| How did I give it back?

My self-respect.

Oh,sure,that you can get back.

And you haven't even tried to hit on me.

No. And I don't intend to.

I just want to see you get your life together again.

Boy,I've hated you for so many years.

I'm starting to think maybe I was wrong.

No,no,no,you're were right-- this is new for me.

Well,I like this Charlie.

He's got a big heart.

Thank you.

Desiree,wait.

Instead of going back to that motel,

why don't you stay here?

No strings-- just until you can get a real apartment.

Where would I sleep?

You can have the guest room.

Well,where would Alan sleep?

If there was any justice, at the bottom of a ravine.

* Men. *

I can't believe you gave her my room.

I can't believe you're still calling it your room.

How long is this gonna last?

Just until she|| gets back on her feet.

Oh,please, that's a load of crap.

That's what I said to you six years ago.

You've been here six years?

I'll just go make up the couch.

(quietly): Story of my life.

No bonerS goes unpunished.

* Men. *

(door opens)

Charlie.

Huh?

I was lying in bed alone, and I had an epiphany.

Okay.

It suddenly became clear to me why you came back into my life.

Why?

The Lord sent you.

The Lord?

Yes. He sent you to save me from my sinful ways.

He did? Yes.

I really don't think he'd send me.

I'm more of a recruiter for the other side.

It's not for us to question his will.

Come,come,let's pray together.

Now? Yes,now,while the spirit is with us.

|| Can I pee first?

There'll b||e plenty of time to pee in Heaven.

There's peeing in Heaven?

Shh!||

Weird,us both being on our knees at the same time,huh?

Shh!

I'm just saying.

* Men. *

Morning.

Morning. Morning.

Morning. How'd everybody sleep?

Fine. Fine.

Lousy.

So,listen...

we might have a little problem with Miss Pasternak.

Oh,Charlie,you didn't.

No,I didn't. Why do you always believe the worst of me?

Because you're a horrible, evil person.

I thought we established that.

I'll tell you what happened.

Last night,I was upstairs, sleeping alone,

minding my own business...

Good morning,sinners.

Oh,what a glorious day

to bask in the forgiveness of our Lord.

Uh-oh.

Jake,I have wonderful news.

From now on, as part of each lesson,

we're gonna spend time casting demons out of you.

It's the Devilh] that's making him stupid.

I told you it wasn't my fault.

Uh,uh,Miss Pasternak, while I'm thrilled

that you're helping Jake with his schoolwork,

I'm not sure an exorcism is really called for.

Do you want your son to go to hell,Alan?

Depends.

Do they have a college prep program?

Eternal damnation is no laughing matter.

I know-- I've been married twice.

(laughs)

You think you have to wear a jockstrap in hell?

Yes,but not your own.

Anyway,

I just came down to tell you all

it's time to get dressed for church.

Uh,uh,gee,

uh,thanks for the iite,

but,uh,Sunday is kind of our "me" day.

Sunday's not a "me" day, it's a "he" day.

And he will strike down the blasphemers and the disbelievers

with fury and blood-soaked vengeance!

So,chop-chop,washy-washy.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again:

Boy,can I pick 'em.

* Men. *

CONGREGATION: * Bringing in the sheaves *

* Bringing in the sheaves *

* We shall come rejoicing *

* Bringing in the sheaves *

* Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... *

Dad? What?

I promise I'll work really hard in school

if you can just get d of her.

A little religion isn't gonna kill you.

Oh,really?

What's your definition of "blood-soaked vengeance"?

* Bringing in the sheaves *

* Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves *

* We shall come rejoicing *

Why you looking at me like that?

I just don't want to miss it when you burst into flames.

* Bringing in the sheaves *

* We shall come rejoicing... *

Isn't th a beautiful little church,Charlie?

Oh,yeah,it's great.

Listen,I thought maybe after the service,

you and I could drive around

and look for a nice apartment for you.

Oh,God doesn't want us to separate,Charlie.

He brought you back into my life

so that we could be together for all eternit

rn Um,are those his words or yours?

He speaks through me.

|| Oh,okay.

Um,to whom am I talking now?

(music ends)

Oh,oh.

It's time for the special blessing.

Come on,everyone, let's go.

Right behind you.

(organ playing)

Come on,come on,come on.

Blessing time, blessing time.

Come on.

Ishis the kind of church

where they hand out those little crackers?

oo

Relax.

It's just us.

Oh.

Why is your hair all wet?

They tried to drown me.

No,they didn't.

He managed to get himself baptized.

How'd that happen?

People were lining up.

||I thought there was food.

Even after they took your clothes

and gave you a white robe?

I figured maybe we were getting ribs.

So where's Berta?

She took a shine to the organ player

|| and stayed for the senior potluck brunch.

So there was food.

I knew I wasn't crazy.

Aren't you at all concerned about

what happened to Miss Pasternak?

Of course I'm ||concerned.

I tried to hide,didn't I?

After she alized

that you had dumped her yet again,

she had a little bit of a meltdown.

There was more tmelt?

She was dripping through the cone when she left the house.

She grabbed all the bills out of the collection plate

and started grinding on the minister.

Okay. No harm,no foul.

How do you figure?

That's how we found her,right?

Dry-humping for dollars.

What happened to all your guilt about ruining her life?

Oh,I still got it.

I'm just learning to live with it.

You're unbelievable.

Oh,come on.

I tried to do the right thing.

My intentions were good.

That's the funny thing about you.

Doesn't seem to matter what your intentions are.

Good,bad or indifferent,

everyone around you ends up suffering.

|| So it's not my fault,right?

Right.

Come on,I'll buy you a drink.

I'm really not in the od.

Oh,relax.

It's all over.

Nothing to worry about.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, hey, Alan.

Jake, your dad's here.

So, how's it going?

All good.

Good.

You?
Good.

Well, good.

Yeah, good.

Gooood.

Well, I, uh, I see you
put in a new mailbox.

Oh, yeah, the old one
was pretty shoddy.

Whoever put it in didn't
anchor the pole correctly.

That would be me.

Oh, sorry.

The mailman was complaining
about the wiggle.

Herb, the mailman's a pothead.

Yeah, I know. I caught him
eating my tomato plants.

Anyway, I just decided
to replace the whole thing.

Yeah, I see it, uh,
it now says "The Melnicks."

Well, I paid for the mailbox.

I get my mail there.

My name's Melnick...

Yeah, I... I get it.

I mean, what does it
say on your mailbox?

Charlie Harper.

Oh.

Jake!

No need to yell.
He's in the bathroom.

Big surprise, eh?

He's either shoveling it in
or shooting it out.

Yeah, he's a regular Play-Doh
fun factory.

Just go make sure he hasn't
fallen asleep in there again.

Yes, dear.

So, how's everything?

Fine.

Listen, Alan, I've been thinking
now that Jake's a teenager,

he'd benefit from spending
some more time with his dad.

Oh, oh, that would be great.

Nothing would make me happier

than to spending more time
with my son.

Good.

Hey, Dad.

Oh, hey, buddy.

All finished
in the bathroom?

For now.

You should've
seen the last one.

It looked like
a question mark.

Terrific.

And it came out of my colon.

Get it?

Hilarious.

Commas are easy.

Go.

Um, so, uh, what are we
talking about here?

You know, an extra day or two
every other week?

Actually, I was thinking more
like a solid three months.

In a row?

Alan, how many sons do you have?

As many as you do.

Look, do you want
your kid or not?

Of course, but... well, I'll
have to clear it with Charlie,

and... and there is
the financial issue.

What financial issue?

Well, if he's going
to be living with me,

I'm thinking I should
get a sizeable break

on the child support.

Well, you're certainly entitled
to your opinion.

Well, thank you.

Wait a minute.

Three months in a row?!

Come on.
It'll be fun.
For who?

All he does is eat, sleep
and clog up the toilets.

Shh!

Let's talk
about this later.

Oh, please, chowderhead
can't hear us.

Right, chowderhead?

See?

Oh, just admit it:
you love having him around.

I love having him around because
I always know he's leaving.

Don't take the leaving part
away from me, Alan.

Let's just give it a chance.

See how it works.

That's what Poland said
about the Germans.

Been watching
the History Channel again?

It's Nazi week.

It's always Nazi week.

Look, tell you what,

why don't I take you and Jake
out to dinner tonight?

Can we get chili burgers?

So, numbnuts...

Any thoughts as to why your mom
dumped you off on us?

Charlie.

Oh, like you're not curious.

No! No, I'm not curious.

She just thought
it would be a good idea

for him to spend more time
with his father.

Yeah, and I'm trying
to save girls

a long ride home on the freeway.

So what's your theory, Alfalfa?

I think you're just pretending
to be considerate

so you can have sex with them.

No, no, I mean
about your mother and Herb.

Oh.

They are fighting a lot.

They're fighting?

Yep.

31.

31?

It's what you get when you add
24 and seven.

You know, they're fighting
all the time.

24/7.

31.

I'm not gonna make it
three months, Alan.

You're gonna be fine.

They're fighting
in front of you?

They don't think
they're fighting in front of me

'cause sometimes when
I wear the headphones,

I turn the music off.

And you figured that out
all by yourself?

Hey, you may think I'm dumb,
but you overestimate me.

My mistake.

So what are they arguing about?

Well, she doesn't
like his parents,

he doesn't like her spending,
and something about sex.

What about sex?

That's when I turn the music
back on, you sick freak.

Sorry.

I mean, that's my mother.

I said I'm sorry.

Man, I'm not gonna make it
three months.

Oh, great, now he's got
the moral high ground.

Forget about that.

The important thing is,

Judith and Herb are having
marital problems.

Why does that make you happy?

Well, it's not happiness
exactly.

It's just that, you know,

all these years
she's been blaming me

for the failure of our marriage,
and now...

Yeah, I guess happiness
pretty much sums it up.

* Men. *

Hey, what's this I hear

about Little Lord Skidmark
coming to live here full time?

Oh, it's just for a few weeks.

I'm sure
if we all pull together,

you'll hardly even notice
he's here.

Yeah, pull this.

Charlie!

You and me gotta
have a conversation.

Nice talking to you.

(doorbell rings)

Hey, Alan.
Oh, hey, Herb.

Judith asked me to drop
this stuff off for Jake.

Oh, let me help you.

Thanks.

So, what have you two lovebirds
got planned

for the next few months?

Second honeymoon?

No, not exactly.

Hard to believe you're coming up
on your second anniversary.

Yep. Hard to believe.

Two years.

Time flies
when you're having fun, eh?

I wouldn't know.

Hey, Herb.

Hey, Charlie.

You ask him about his marriage
going down the crapper?

I was easing into it.

So was I.

What's the problem, Herb?

Is it in the bedroom?

It usually starts
in the bedroom.

That's still my mother,
you sick freak!

We usually wait till
he puts on headphones

before we discuss
these things.

Gee, Herb, something
you should know

about the headphones is...

Shh, shh!
Don't spoil it.

So what's the deal?
Is it sex?

No.

Well, yeah, but...
it's no big deal.

I mean every marriage
has an ebb and flow to it.

Of course.
Sure. Sure.

Right now Judith and I
are kind of ebbing.

A lot.

31.

Right.

31.

I don't know
what's happening, man.

We can't seem
to communicate anymore.

She constantly
finds fault with me.

I don't know
what to do.

I'll tell you
what to do.

What my testicle-challenged
brother should have done.

As soon as
she starts complaining,

you put your foot down.

Let her know who's in charge.

And no matter what, do not
let her use sex as a weapon.

You let her know that if she
won't satisfy your needs,

there's plenty of women
out there who will.

Really?

Why would I lie?

Women like Judith respond to
strength and confidence, not...

well, that.

Oh, you make a compelling case.

Damn right I do.

Now go claim what's yours.

I believe I will.

Thanks, Charlie.

I'm here for you, big guy.

Why did you do that?

I get bored.

* Men. *

Hey.
Hey.

Why aren't you in school?

I'm sick.

Sick?

Relax, I'm just faking
to get out of a math test.

Oh, okay, good.

You scared me.

What's with the staple gun?

Oh, the sole's coming
off my shoe.

Ah.

You might want
to take it off first.

Good call.

Morning.

(staple gun clacking)

It's none of my business,
but that's one kid

who can't afford to miss
a single day of school.

(staple gun clacking)

Yeah, like school's
gonna make a difference.

(staple gun clacking)
JAKE:
Ow! Crap!

I stapled my fingers together.

You got a point.

* Men. *

Come on, honey. Blow.

(blowing nose)

(muffled):
What's he got?

A cold, I think.

Then why didn't you
leave him at home?

That way, we all don't
have to get sick.

(coughing)

And that's why
you should always
take your shoes

to a fully qualified,
professional cobbler.

You know what's good?
Apple cobbler.

What's the damage, doc?

Will he play
the violin again?

He'll be fine.

You might wanna keep him away
from staple guns.

Right.

Also nail guns,
glue guns,

pretty much anything
with "gun" in it.

Got it.
Thanks, Herb.

Hey, Charlie, could I talk
for you a sec?

Why don't you go wait
for me in the car?

Gimme the keys.

I'm not giving you the keys.

Then how am I gonna wait
in the car?

Wait by the car.

I don't have sunscreen on.
I'm very fair-skinned.

Then wait under the car.

What's up?

Well, remember that advice
you gave me

about how
to handle Judith?

Oh, gee, Herb,
that wasn't so much advice

as, you know, social satire.

Well, it worked
out great.

Really?

She bought
that king-of-the-castle crap?

No, no, she kicked my ass out.

But the thing is,
talking with you

and seeing how you live,

I'm convinced
I'm better off single.

Is that so?

Oh, yeah. I mean,
why chew on one chicken wing

when you can eat
from the whole bucket?

Just so there's no confusion.

Chicken wings are...?

Women, Charlie.

I was offering up a metaphor.

And you went with wings
rather than breasts and thighs.

Ooh, that is better.

Anyway, I was thinking maybe
you and I can go out sometime

and get a party pack.

Sex with strange women.

I'm extending the metaphor.

Of course.
Sure, let's do that sometime.

Thanks again for
sewing up the kid.

So, uh, what color
do you like?

Excuse me?

Oh, I-I was thinking Asian,
but I'll take the green.

* Men. *

Hey, Dad..

Oh, hey.
How are you feeling?

Fine.

Throat's not sore anymore?

(coughs)
Oh, yeah, a little.

What happened to your fingers?

Oh, I stapled 'em together.

Ah.

Hey, hey, we do not leave
our shoes on the...

What the hell?

We need to get rid
of the staple gun.

Alan, staple guns don't staple
shoes to coffee tables.

Idiots do.

Why are you taking
your temperature?

I think some little snot locker
gave me smallpox.

(phone rings)

Oh, man, leave me alone.

Is that Mom?

You think maybe I might want
to talk to her?

Do you?

Of course not.
It's the principle.

Well, that wasn't Mom.
It was Herb.

Why is Herb calling?

Since Judith
threw him out,

he wants me to help
him pick up women.

Wait.
Backupbackupbackupbackup
backupbackup!

Wait. Judith threw Herb out?
When?

I don't know.
Apparently, about a week ago.

Oh, my God.

That's terrible.

Judith must be
devastated.

Alan.

Yeah?

You got a little evil
on your face.

Other side.

* Men. *

Oh, Judith, that's terrible.

You must be devastated.

You must be devastated.

What are
you doing here?

Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

Apparently, Jake left
his Social Studies book,

so here I am.

I think I saw it
in the bathroom.

Why?
Was he out of toilet paper?

Wouldn't it be great
if he could learn that way?

You know, assmosis.

What?

Nothing.

Is Herb around?

Uh, no.

Oh. Oh, too bad.

Why?

No reason.

I just enjoy seeing
the big galoot.

Well, the galoot is not here.

Oh. Well, uh...

tell him I said hi.

I will.

(sobbing)

Herb moved out!

Our marriage is over!

Oh, Judith, that's terrible.

You must be devastated.

* Men. *

What exactly do
you have in mind?

Give me your hand.

Okay.

Do I feel warm to you?

Dude!

Aw, crap.

So, uh, you fishing here or can
I throw my bobber in the water?

Bye.

How'd you know I was here?

Well, I tried calling,

but your phone
must be broken,

so I went by your house
and Jake said you went out.

All I had to do
was punch "liquor"

into the ol' in-dash
navigation system,

and three stops
later, voila.

So, uh, they
biting tonight?

can we stop
with the fish talk?

Believe me, it's not
gonna lead anyplace good.

Back to the chickens?

If we must.

I'll have what he's having.

I'm having a tall
Pain in the Ass.

Sounds good.

Does it have rum in it?

How did this happen?

How did I blow
another marriage?

Oh, sweetie, you can't
blame yourself.

Although you are the
common denominator.

Alan, I'm 40 years old.

How am I ever gonna
start over again?

I know, I know.

And soon you're gonna be 41.

Do you have any idea
what it's like

to try and date
when all the men your age

are only interested in
25-year-old hard bodies?

Well, you can't blame us.

Of course, you can't compete
hard body to hard body,

but you're still
a very desirable woman.

You think so?

Well, of course I do.

For your age,
you're a very...

Hey, Charlie, I've got
a question for you.

Yeah.

The hotel I'm staying in
has pay-per-view adult movies.

Uh-huh?

Whatever happened
to pubic hair?

Gone the way of the dodo bird,
my friend.

I mean, I can understand
with the ladies,

but what's the deal
with the fellas?

It's like with
an ugly house.

A little shrubbery
helps the curb appeal.

I don't have an answer
for you, Herb.

What about you?

Do you trim the old hedges?

Yeah. They're shaped
like Disney characters.

Two more vodka tonics.

Cock-a-doodle-do.

Hello.

Hello.

Allow me to
introduce myself.

Dr. Herbert Melnick.

Ooh, a doctor.

Dr. Charlie Harper.

Wow, two doctors.

Maybe we should
let them examine us.

(both giggle)

In the interest
of full disclosure,

I should let you know
that I'm new to the dating world

and still have all
my original pubic hair.

Oh, Alan, why did
I ever let you go?

Well, if I recall,

it was something about me
sucking the life out of you.

I was wrong.
I was so wrong.

You are a good man
and I'm never gonna
let you go again.

Never?

Never.

Never ever?

Morning.

Morning.

What was Herb
doing here?

Oh, he, uh...

(rock music blaring)

(music stops playing)

He shaved his pubes
and passed out in your room.

You might want to change
the blade in your razor.

Thank you.

Where were you
all night?

I was in Never Ever Land.

Um...

do I want to know?

I took away the staple gun,
but he found the superglue.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:Two and a half men

Wait. Judith threw Herb out? When?

Apparently, about a week ago.

Of course you can't compete hard body to hard body,

but you're still a very desirable woman.

You think so?

Oh! Oh, Alan.

You're a good man, and I'm never gonna let you go again.

Never?

I thought you'd be happy.

I thought so, too.

I mean, come on.

You had the woman who took all your money

and threw you out of your house, naked and crouched on the sofa.

There was no sofa.

It was the divan in her bedroom, and I was doing the crouching.

Why were you...?

Never mind. I don't want to know.

The point is, you won.

You had a perfect night of revenge sex.

That's the fourth best kind of sex you can have.

Fourth?

What are the other...?

Never mind. I don't want to know.

Charlie, the problem is that now that Judith and Herb are over,

she thinks that we're...

...back to square one

in dealing with the PTA carnival.

What?

The-The school carnival

that we used to, uh, raise money for.

I don't want Jake to know about me and Judith...

...Ithcariot.

Judith Ithcariot.

Who thold out our lord for 30 pieces of thilver.

What are you talking about?

Oh, I was just, uh, telling your uncle

about this, uh... this, uh... this great, uh, cartoon.

Uh, "Daffy Duck and the Greateth Sthory Ever Told."

Sounds lame.

Classic Warner Brothers animation.

Boy, you really suck at this.

The thing is, I'm not sure I want to be back with Judith.

Well, let's look at the pros and cons.

The pros are, if you move out,

I'll have an empty guest room....

tinest, tootin'est apostle in all of Jerusalem.

Gethsemane Sam!

What?

Or how about Barabas Bunny?

Uh, what's up, Pontius?

If Berta finds out you're leaving,

she'll want your room, and I n't need a live-in maid.

Oh, don't worry. I'm not leaving.

Oh, good, 'cause I was worried.

Look,

I have already been married to Judith, and we...

We... We...

We should send Jack to military school?

What?

Oh, oh, uh, yeah.

Charlie, he wasn't supposed to hear that.

I'm going to military school?

If you don't shape up, yeah.

And it's not gonna be our military, either.

I don't want to go to any military school.

Well, then, you better get to your homework.

Okay, okay.

Extortion.So simple.

Who knew?

If the kid's going to military school,

I'll take his room.

No, no, Berta, you misunderstood.

He's not going to military school?

I'm not going to military school?!

You are going to military school!

He's not going to military school.

Okay, then, I'll take Zippy's room

when he moves back to Judith.

Oh, for God's sake, does she hear everything?

Some things I just infer.

Get me another beer, would you?

Why can't you get it yourself?

(Reveille)

This is beautiful.

Hey, Judith. What's shakin'?

Mom, I'll be good! Don't send me to military school!

Where's that beer, maggot?

Nothing. Nothing.

Just a little game we're playing.

So anyway, Judy, what's new in your little world?

Hang on. I'll see if he's here.

Oh, no, no. I'm not here. I'm not here.

Sorry, he's not here.

Oh, wait. He just walked in.

Why?

Why not?

Oh, hey, hey, Judith.

I was just about to call you.

Hold on a sec.

Let me... Let me get some privacy.

What are they talking about?

Nothing important.

I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

Where's Jake?

Washing my car.

Then he's gonna clean the garage.

We should have thought of this years ago.

I know. I'm kicking myself.

Okay, I won't be late.

Hot date with the ex?

Oh, no, nothing hot about it.

It's just dinner, and I'm going to tell her

that the other night was just a onetime thing,

and that I don't see that we have a future together.

But me you see a future with?

I finished the garage.

You sure?

Yeah.

("The Halls of Montezuma")

Let me look again.

More wine?

Oh, I'd-I'd better not.

I have to drive.

Have some more wine.

Maybe a splash.

Oh, oh, my.

I, uh, hope this is a good driving wine.

Oh, that-that feels good.

I'm glad.

Have you been working out?

Oh, just the Bowflex.

I, uh, had to give up my gym membership

so I could get my tooth filled.

Well, whatever you're doing, it's working.

A lot of definition here.

Oh, Oh, that would be this one.

Oh, yeah, there it is.

So, would you like some dessert?

Oh, oh, don't go to any trouble.

It's no trouble, sweetie.

I like taking care of you.

And I like being taken care of.

Wake up! Wake up!

Um, uh, listen, Judith,

I-I've been thinking about you and me.

Me, too.

Oh. . Oh, good.

You know, even though

the other night was wonderful and all,

I think it might be better

if we tried slowing things down a bit.

I agree. You do?

Of course. I'm barely out of my marriage to Herb.

True, true.

Here, careful. Hot pudding.

So, uh, you'll get the divorce,

and then, you know, we'll see where we are.

That sounds great. Well, good.

I'm, uh... I'm glad we're on the same page.

-Oh, hot.  -I told you it was hot.

Hot! Hot! Hot!

Have some more wine.

That's better. That's better.

I'll get your spoon.

Oh. Oh, God.

Oh.... pudding!

So when the moment's right, and she's ready,

you'll be ready, too.

Side effects may include, nausea, headaches, dry mouth,

blurred vision, dizziness, anal leakage,

kidney failure and massive stroke.

She'd better be ready to call an ambulance.

Is Jake asleep?

Probably not.

After dinner, I made him watch  Full Metal Jacket

and Deerhunter.

Oh, Charlie.

And how was your evening?

Oh, it was really a lot of fun.

You know, I'd forgotten how nice she can be.

Judith?

Who else would I be talking about?

I don't know. Somebody actually nice.

What was the name of Jimmy Carter's wife?

Rosalynn?

She was nice.

I always got a good vibe off her.

Are you drunk?

Define drunk.

Would you rather I talk to you in the morning?

No, no. The liquor makes you more interesting. Go on.

Judith's changed, Charlie.

She's-She's a different woman.

Different than the one who threw you out of your house

with your nuts in a to-go bag?

That's a little graphic, don't you think?

I'm an artist, Alan.

I paint with words.

You're a lush, Charlie.

You paint with vomit.

My point is that Judith has become a warm, nurturing woman.

You nailed her again, didn't you?

No, no, no, it was just, just the one time.

Tonight, we did not have sex.

Technically.

Really? Judith?

I know. I had to keep peeking to make sure it was her.

Well, congratulations.

So when are you gonna move back in?

Ah, we're not quite there yet.

Oh, come on, why wait?

We could load up the car and drive over there tonight.

You promised if I shaped up, I wouldn't have to go!

Aren't you starting to feel a little guilty about misleading him?

Yeah, I guess.

Tell you what.

After he finishes cleaning the deck tomorrow,

let's really senend him to military school.

How's it going?

I'm almost done.

What about the railing?

It's getting dark. I won't finish in time.

No problem. I'll give you a hand.

Gee, thanks.

You back-talkin' me, soldier?

No.

No what?

No way?

No, sir.

Right. No, sir.

That's better.

* I don't know, what I've been told *

* Screwin' with jughead never gets old. *

Okay, don't wait up.

Hey, Alan,

the chimney's a little blocked up

with leaves and crap, and I thought,

maybe if I tied a rope around the kid,

I could lower him down into it...

Charlie, that borders on child abuse.

So, it's okay?

Around his waist, not his neck.

Good night, Jake.

Good night, Dad. I love you.

Oh, Herb, hi.

Hey, Alan, Charlie.

Hey, Herb. What's up?

Well, I was just on my way down to The Sand Dollar.

I thought maybe you and Alan would like to join me.

It's ladies night.

What do you say, Alan?

You can get in for half price.

Plus, all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.

Just keeps getting better, huh?

No, I-I-I... I have other plans.

Oh. Got a date?

Yeah, Alan.

You got a date?

gn No. A date?

Not likely.

No, I have a-a-a... a meeting with the, uh,

the-the-the thing about the... about the group.

I told you. Remember?

No. Tell me again.

He's a little pickled.

Uh, well, if you must know, uh, uh,

I-I-I-I belong to a...

a book club that I am going to.

Oh, that's right.

What book are you reading again?

It's... it's a mystery,

uh, called Why Are You  Doing This To Me?

Oh, yeah, it's by the same guy

who wrote  Because It Amuses Me.

Boy, I wouldn't havead you two pegged as readers.

Well, there you go.

Good night.

-Hey, Alan?  -Yeah?

You talk much to Judith these days?

-Nope, see you.  -Oh, well,

you speak to her, tell her I say hi.

-Okay.  -And that the

time we spent together is very special to me,

and if she needs anything, uh, just call me.

I'm there.

u know what's a good book?

Under the Dining Room Table by Richard Gobbler.

But... but it does not compare

to Wait Till Your Liver Fails by Hope Udai.

Well, what do you say, Charlie, huh?

Me and you?

Go down to the Sand Dollar, have a few drinks.

Who knows, maybe we'll meet a couple of nice gals.

Sure, why not?

And if the pickings are slim,

you could always wrangle up some of your prostitute friends.

Oh, boy.

Prostitutes and popcorn shrimp.

All you can eat.

Okay, Herb,

let me explain to you something about hookers.

Oh, man.

Who's been feeding the seagulls blueberries?

Here you go.

Oh, qui brille.

Yummy.

Oops, I dropped my spoon.

Um, you know, I... I ran into Herb today.

What?

He came by the house.

Why would he come by your house?

I just think he's lonely.

He misses you.

Well, too bad.

So, you don't miss him?

Ow, ow, Alan!

Are we gonna spend all night talking about Herb

or do you want me to get my spoon?

Well, if you're gonna bark at me,

there's really no point in you getting your spoon.

I'm not barking at you, I'm...

You're right.

I'm sorry.

I'm right and you're sorry?

Let's not waste the night arguing

when we could spend it doing anything you want.

Anything?

Anything.

Can you say I'm right again?

Jesus,herb. you live here?

This is really depressing.

You should see i during the day.

You'd want to hang yourself.

Well, ladies,

welcome to Casa de Herb.

That's Spanish for House of Herb.

-Just open the door. -Hold on.

I'll trade you the lounge lizard for the Jolly Green Jackass.

I hope you gals like trains.

Slow down, buddy.

It's just the two of us.

All aboard!

I bet you thought this was gonna be weird.

Pretty nice, huh?

Best H.O. money can buy.

You don't have to spell it, Herb.

They know what they are.

So, shall we get this party started?

Okeydokey.

Would you like a snack or a cold beverage?

Um, Herb, while there is a social stigma to this transaction,

the big plus is these girls don't require any wining and dining.

They just want to do the deed,

then get as far away from us as they can.

Really?

Not even a Snapple?

They're not thirsty, Herb.

And you're paying them by the hour.

Oh, okay.

Well, I guess we should just, uh,

go to the bedroom and, uh...

Don't make me do this, Charlie.

What are you talking about?

This was your idea.

I don't care.

I'm not like you.

I can't lay with whores.

No offense.

Where are you going?

I love my wife!

I want her back!

All aboard?

Sweetie, uh, you're humming again.

Sorry.

Don't know the words.

Um, okay, uh, could you please not open your mouth so wide?

Better now?

Yeah, it's fine.

Just, uh, can you not talk in my mouth?

More rules than a public pool around here.

They're not rules.

It's just, uh, I know what I like,

and you're not doing it.

All right, fine, what, uh...

what do you like, Judith?

I have to tell you?

No, no, let me guess and get yelled at.

Nobody's yelling at you, Alan.

-I'm not your mother.-Oh, you're right,

my mother can emasculate me without raising her voice.

Oh, God, I can't do this.

-Do what? -I can't be with you again.

I was afraid of being 40 years old and all by myself,

but dying alone has got to be better than being stuck with you.

Okay, now you're starting to sound like my mother.

Judith, I love you.

Please take me back.

Oh, boy, this is awkward.

Coming, darling.

Get out of here.

Oh, uh, just so we're clear,

we've decided to see other people?

Get out!

Thanks for the ride, girls.

And for bringing me home.

* I've been working on the railroad *

* All the livelong day *

* Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow... *

Hey, Alan.

Mind if I join you?

It's your house.

Oh, yeah.

Excuse me.

Pardon me, hot soup.

What the hell?

Well, that's a little embarrassing.

What is that?

A railroad crossing sign.

Sorry, I need more.

I was having sex on a train set.

How else do you get a crossing sign stuck to your ass?

Of course.

Hey, it could have been worse.

I could have had a caboose in my caboose.

Well, come on, that's funny.

So, what happened when Herb showed up at Judith's house?

How did you know about that?

Lucky guess.

She kicked me out again, Charlie.

I had to sneak out her back door

while she threw herself into Herb's arms.

What's so funny?

You said, "back door."

That reminds me of my caboose joke.

Good night.

I'm here all week.

Tip your waitresses.

Hey, Mom, it's Charlie.

Yeah, I know it's late.

Listen, do you think this is funny?

Must have got disconnected.

Hey, Jake, you sleeping?



-Doorbell. -Doorbell!

Coming.

Oh, hi, uh, thanks for bringing him over.

Oh, no problem-- hey, guess what?

Uh, Herb, why don't we let Jake tell him.

Uh, tell me what?

Jake?

My grades aren't good enough for military school, so ha-ha.

No, sweetheart, the other thing.

I'm gonna have a little brother or sister.

You're... you're pregnt?

Yes, Alan.

Herb and I are going to have a baby.

Congratulations.

Try to keep this one away from the lead paint.

Did you hear that Alan?

They've only been back together six weeks,

and they're gonna have a baby.

I heard.

Come on in.

We'll pop a bottle of champagne.

Champagne.

Uh, no, we really should be going.

Come on, Herb.

-Good-bye. -Ah, shoot.

What a remarkable coincidence.

Yeah, coincidence.

-You okay? -No.

Come on, let's sit you down.

Yeah... let's sit me down.

Here you go, buddy.

Here I go.

What's wrong with him?

He's doing math in his head.

Oh, yeah, that's a bitch.



.......... ********** ..........

Morning.

Mmm. Morning.

Charlie, please don't start anything.

Too late. I woke up started.

I have to get to work.

Okay, I've got a job for you.

We'll finish this tonight.

I may have to finish this myself.

Knock yourself out.

It's no fun if you have permission.

So, Charlie, I was
thinking maybe tonight

we could stay at my place.

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

Charlie?

I'm sorry, did you say something?

I said maybe tonight we
could stay at my place.

You want to play on my face?

Stay at my place.

What about it?

I've been coming here
for the past three weeks,

and it's like an hour
drive for me to get to work.

Well, I'd be happy to spring for a cab.

It's not the drive, you idiot.

You just said it was the drive.

What I mean is if we're gonna
see each other on a regular basis

there should be some give and take.

Based on last night,
we're pretty even Steven

in the give-and-take
department.

And if I recall correctly,
you're up one "take."

Hey, of the two of us, I'm
the one with tennis elbow.

So what about tonight?

I'd love to, but it
might be a little tricky.

Why?

Oh, I knew she'd ask me that.

I'm starting to get the feeling

that you only want to see at your place

and at your convenience.

No, of course not.

Well, then fine, you'll
stay at my place tonight.

Sounds great.

Lookin' forward to it.

So what do you want to do this weekend?

Doesn't matter, just as
long  you and I are together.

What did you do?

I didn't do anything.

Why would you even ask me that?

I'm guessing he either
robbed a liquor store

or killed a drifter.

Do I need to call your
mother and ask her?

If you want to, but you know
how she pushes your buttons.

I'll take that chance.

Fine, I don't care.

All right, all right! I got
thrown off the school bus.

You got the spine of a gummy bear.

Why were you thrown off the bus?

Well, actually, it's a funny story.

Amuse me.

Have you ever heard of
this thing called mooning?

Yeah. Yeah, it rings a bell.

The bus was going past
the girls' track team

and a bunch of us thought
it'd be funny to moon them.

See, she gets it.

Berta.

Sorry. I'm just remembering my prom.

So what happened?

Well, I was working near
the high school that night,

and I thought it would be
fun to drive the backhoe...

No. Not you.

Him.

Well. Excuse me for sharing.

What happened?

Well, it sounds like
Berta had quite a prom.

You're skating on thin ice, Jake.

Boy, that's something we haven't done

In a long time-- skating.

Jake!

Mom grounded me for two weeks.

Why didn't your mother
tell me about this?

I promised I'd tell you.

What can I say? She believed me.

So how about a movie? A
little father-son bonding.

No, no. No movies.

- Skating?
- No skating.

Fine.

Also no TV, no video games,

no cell phones,
and no iPods--

nothing that gives you
any amusement or enjoyment.

Couldn't you just smack me with
a belt and get it over with?

Get out of here.

I'm bored.

Oh, man.

What's the matter?

Did you know that Culver City

is all the way down near the airport?

Yes.

That's gotta be like
45 minutes from here.

If there's no traffic.

Traffic?

Is this Culver City place popular?

Not particularly, but there
are other people with cars

living lives completely
separate from your own.

Oh, right.

I hate those people.

"So what's in Culver City?," he asked,

knowing the only possible answer.

Can you believe she wants
me to schlep all the way

over to her place just so we
can spend the night together?

Aw, you poor guy.

You have to drive 45
minutes to get laid.

And 45 minutes to get back.

That's 90 minutes behind the wheel

for 20, 30 minutes behind...

Well, I don't need to draw you a map.

You're breaking my heart.

And it's not just that.

She said there's only street parking.

Which means trees.

And trees have that,
you know, toxic syrup

that drips out of them
and gets all over your car.

Sap.

If I make that drive, I am.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

You always said that it was better to go

to the woman's house so that
you could make a quick getaway.

Yeah, for one-nighters that's fine.

But this girl, I care about.

We've been seeing each
other for almost a month.

And yet you just found
out where she lives.

There's a difference between
caring and stalking, Alan.

Hey, Dad, I need my laptop.

- What for?
- Homework.

What homework?

Um... Damn, you're good.

Thanks for driving all
the way over here, Charlie.

Are you kidding?

I would've walked here if I had to.

Probably would've been
faster with the traffic.

Good night.

Good night.

What are you doing?

I heard a car door.

Your Mercedes is fine, Charlie.

I know, I know.

Just double-checking.

Probably gonna get sap
all over the car cover.

Isn't that what it's for?

You don't get it. That's fine.

No TV in the bedroom, huh?

It's in the living room.

You just got the one?

How many do I need?

Well, you've got three
rooms and a bath, so... four.

If you want to go watch
television instead of cuddling,

that's up to you.

No, no, I'd much rather cuddle.

At my house, we could do both.

You know, cuddling and Sportscenter.

Good night, Charlie.

Sweet dreams.

What now?

Nothing. I'm just used to sleeping
on the other side of the bed.

Yeah, so?

So I usually sleep on my left side,

which faces me towards
the edge of the mattress.

But here, I'm facing the back
of your head-- which is fine;

there are certainly times
when I enjoy seeing it

from that angle--

but, you know, when I'm trying to sleep,

it's a little disconcerting.

Well, I'm sorry, but this is my side.

But you sleep on the
other side at my house.

Because it's your
house; this is my house.

But I'm a guest.

And I'm the guest at your house.

-That's different.
-How?

Give me a minute.

Good night, Charlie.

Boy, you're being pretty inflexible.

Oh, you think  I'm inflexible.

Well, not physically,

but you got to admit in this regard,

you're a little stubborn.

Good night, Charlie.

Okay. Good night.

How about this?

If we switch sides and
an armed intruder came in,

I could leap up and protect you.

But this way, you're pretty much
guaranteed to catch the first bullet.

What if he comes through the window?

Oh, great.

Now I'm never gonna get to sleep.

Jake?

You'd better not be watching TV.

Maybe he's upstairs.

It's like trying to sleep
in the freaking jungle.

What's going on?

Nothing, nothing.

I was going to the bathroom,
and I stepped on a cat.

You don't have to sneak out.

If you want to leave, leave.

Whoa, I'd say someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

But I don't want to revisit that topic.

Good-bye, Charlie.

Gee, you sound kind of angry.

Why would I be angry?

Just because I drive to
Malibu every night for a month,

and you won't stay
even one night with me?

Well, that and, you know,
possibly crippling your cat.

Go home, Charlie.

Are you sure?

I'm begging you.

Okay, if that's what you want.

So tomorrow at my place?

You make love like a woman,
but you throw like a man.

Jake?

Why are you sleeping out here?

I was, um... camping?

Okay, well, as long as
you're not watching TV.

Stupid birds.

Hey, how'd it go last night?

I couldn't do it, Alan.
I tried, but I couldn't.

Oh, well, that happens
to all men occasionally.

Especially when you get to be our age.

What are you talking about?

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about how
I'm so set in my ways,

I couldn't spend one
night in a strange house.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

I mean, there was a time
when I could sleep anywhere:

couches, floors, witness
boxes, police cars, jail cells.

That's not sleeping. That's passing out.

I'm not gonna argue semantics with you.

The point is I was really
uncomfortable over there.

Even if I could have gotten to sleep,

the morning would have been a disaster.

How so?

Think about it.

After I had my morning coffee,

where would I go to do my business?

Oh, right, you always want

to have home-field advantage for that.

She's got one of those
wooden toilet seats.

It would've been like
sitting on Pinocchio's mouth.

You ever wonder about people
who can poop in a gas station?

What is wrong with them?

What about Porta-Potties?

Those aren't people. Those are animals.

I'd rather go in the trunk of my car.

I have.

You've gone in the trunk of your car?

No, yours.

That was you?!

I convinced myself a
coyote had gotten in there.

What the hell are you doing?!

Playing "Smoke On the Water."

With your tongue?

Pretty cool, huh?

No, that is not cool. It's disgusting.

Alan, get in here!

What now?

Your kid's licking my piano.

Jake, don't lick your uncle's piano.

I'm bored.

Go read a book.

I don't want to read a book.

Then go lick a book.

How long is this whole
grounding thing gonna go on for?

Two weeks.

Two weeks?

Charlie, he stuck his
ass out a bus window

at the girls' track team.

That's what you're punishing him for?

When you were his age, you
mooned the girls' choir.

No, when I was his age, you pantsed me

in front of the girls' choir.

Oh, right.

Well, either way, you made the yearbook.

Berta, I'm leaving.

Hang on!

Where you going?

I talked Chelsea into
giving me another chance

to spend the night at her place.

Here's your overnight bag.

Thank you.

All that's for one night?

One night and one morning
business meeting with Pinocchio.

I got your flip-flops for the shower,

your personal bath towel,
hand towel and washcloth,

your hand soap, face soap and shampoo.

Great.

One handheld TV, your
goose-down pillow,

Egyptian cotton pillowcase and sheets

and a ziplock baggie of your
special blend French roast coffee.

Terrific.

One jar of seedless
raspberry jam, a mild laxative

and one roll of quilted
toilet paper with lanolin.

Okay.

Culver City, here I come.

He ain't gonna make it.

Not a chance.

You knowI have never once seen
him eat seedless raspberry jam.

That's because you've
never applied a thin layer

to your hindquarters.

I'm so glad you decided

this was important to you, Charlie.

Well, you're important to me.

What are you doing?

I brought my sheets.

You wanna grab the other side?

What's wrong with my sheets?

Nothing, nothing. But mine are better.

Egyptian cotton.

Like, eight-million thread count.

And good news.

I solved the wrong-side-
of-the-bed situation.

Okay...

I'll just sleep with my head down there.

That way, I'm facing the right way.

But then your feet will be in my face.

Way ahead of you.

Peppermint foot lotion.

You'll think you're
sleepin' in Candyland.

Oh, before I forget.

Toilet paper?

Don't get your hopes up, but
I'm gonna make the effort.

Hey, Jake?

You out here?

Seen my kid?

What the hell?

Can I have some privacy, please?

Get out of the tub. Out of the tub.

Fine.

You're unbelievable. Is
TV that important to you?

Do you really have to ask?

Go to your room.

Fine, but check out Uncle
Charlie's toilet seat.

It heats up.

Just go!

Can I have this raspberry jam?

Don't touch the jam!

Toasty.

If only I could poop at night.

Maybe I'll just pee girly style.

Charlie...

What?

This isn't working for me.

My feet too minty?

It's not your feet.

Well, it is your feet,
but it's also the sheets,

the pillows, the towels, the
TV, the electric toothbrush.

It's not a toothbrush.

It's an ultrasonic dental appliance.

It's probably got more
vibrations per minute

than that plastic egg you
keep in your nightstand.

That's right.

I do have one of those.

Go home.

But I want to spend the night here.

No, no, I made a mistake.

From now on, we'll stay at your place.

Oh, okay.

Your call.

I'm nothing if not flexible.

You really should put
a bell on that thing.

.......... ********** ..........

It's Mom.

Say hi for me.

Hi, Mom. Alan wants to talk to you.

Hi, Mom. How was Dubai?

Oh, good, I-I'm glad you met somebody.

Yes, yes, they are a hairy people.

Uh, yeah, I-I don't need to know any more
details, as long as he makes you happy.

That's a detail, Mom.

Oh, no, d-don't worry about your house.

I, uh, I check on it every
day on my way home from work.

Yeah, now, that's why I'm the good son.

Well, uh... have fun with Hamid.

That's another detail, Mom.

Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay, bye-bye.

You haven't been to her
house once, have you?

I checked on it with Google
Earth. It's still there.

At least the roof is anyway.

I'll just run over today and pick
up the newspapers and the mail,

and, uh, replace the dead plants.

You don't think she'll
notice new plants?

Nah, she doesn't pay that much
attention to living things.

Remember when she had the cockatoo?

Oh, yeah.

Polly really wanted a cracker.

Hey, listen, as long as you're
going to be in Beverly Hills,

you can drop my Mercedes off
at the dealership for service.

Happy to do it.

Hey, I don't want to hear it.

You and your kid live here rent-free.

I don't ask for much in return, so
the least you could do for me, Alan...

Charlie, Charlie.

I said I'm happy to do it.

Damn, I was all set to bust your balls.

Sorry to disappoint you.

And just so we're clear, my car is cherry,
so if you bang it, ding it, dent it,

or even change the ass-print in the seat,
just keep driving till you get to Mexico,

then bury yourself in the desert.

I understand your concern, and
trust me, I will be very careful.

You know, you're taking
all the fun out of this.

Okay, "get car serviced." Check.

What's next?

Oh, nap time.

Check.

What the hell are you doing?

You okay?

No, I landed on my ass bone.

Sack up. You'll be fine.

Would you grab my sunglasses
while you're down there?

Recover sunglasses. Check.

Here.

Thks.

What's so interesting over there?

Nothing.

Hey, you know the rule: if
there's topless sunbathers,

you don't hang out and stare at them.

You come get your Uncle Charlie.

Nobody's topless.

Then what are you looking at?

Son of a bitch.

Uncheck.

Just some new neighbors.

New neighbors, huh? What's the deal?

- They making s'mores on the barbecue?
- No.

Chicken?

It has nothing to do with food.

a girl. Is she cute?

No, I'm hanging off the
balcony to look at a mutant.

Don't get snippy. I was
just showing an interest.

Why don't you go over there
and introduce yourself?

I can't do that. It'd look desperate.

You are desperate.

Come on. We'll both go.

Really?

Yeah, why not?

I got a little window
before my next nap.

- Thanks.
- No problem.

What am I going to say?

I don't know. Try saying hello.

Hello? That's all you got?

That's all I got that you can use.

I should have peed before we left.

You've just got a nervous bladder.

Wait till you turn0. You'll feel like
you have to pee while you're still peeing.

- You ready to do this?
- No.

Oh, come on, what's the
worst thing that could happen?

She laughs at me?

Oh, that is so sweet.

No, the worst thing that could happen is
she falls in love with you, you get married.

Ten, 12 years later she comes to her
senses, leaves you, takes all your stuff,

and you have to go live in your car.

Yeah.

What kind of car do you think I'll have?

Hello.

I'm Charlie Harper, and this is Jake.

We live next door. Right, Jake?

I'm Jake.

Hi, I'm Celeste.

I'm Jake.

Honey, is that the cable guy?

No, Dad, it's our neighbors.

Jerome Burnett.

Charlie Harper. This is my nephew Jake.

We just came by to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

Well, that was very nice of you.

Yeah, welcome to the neighborhood. Bye.

Hang on. Hang on. Do
you know who this man is?

Yeah, her dad. Bye.

This is Jerome Burnett, one of
the great NFL players of all time.

You're very kind. Thank you.

- You know what his nickname was, Jake?
- No.

Tell him.

Mad Dog.

That's great. Can I use your bathroom?

- Honey, show him where it is.
- Come on, Jake.

Lady in the house, Jake.
Put the seat back down.

So what have you been to lately?

Oh, still working for the Chargers.

You know, mostly front office stuff.

Really? So you probably have
access to tickets and such.

I do. Do you want me to hook you up?

Oh, gee, I don't want to impose.

I just came by to say hello.
Can you get me a sky box?

I'll see what I can do.

That'd be great.

And I'm guessing if a, if a player got injured,
you'd probably be one of the first to know about it.

You know, even before the, uh,
what do you call 'em-- bookies?

Don't push it, Charlie.

Hey, Dad, would it be all right if
Jake and I take a walk on the beach?

Yeah, sure, why not?

Thanks. See you later.

Isn't that nice?

That boy touches my daughter,
I'm going to be touching you.

Understood.

Can I use your bathroom?

Here you go, Mr. Harper.

Oh, oh, thank you.

cappuccino.

I wonder what they're serving
at the domestic dealerships.

They do take good care of you here.

Of course, they ought to,
considering what we paid for our cars.

Oh, yeah. They are expensive.

Is that your CL65 outside?

yes, it is mine.

How do you like it?

What's not to like?

It does everything
but trim your toenails.

Or maybe it does and I just
haven't found the button yet.

Not that I need to trim my toenails.

Did 'em last night. Over the tub.

Clip, ping, clip, ping!

Diane.

Alan.

So you live around here, Alan?

Uh, no, I live down by the beach.

Santa Monica?

Uh, Malibu.

Ooh, Malibu.

Yep. Malibu.

Yeah, uh, we just call it "the Boo."

You know, like, "Hey, how
are things down at the Boo?"

Mr. Harper, your car is ready.

Oh, uh, thank you. I'll,
uh, I'll be right there.

Well, uh, looks like I'm all done here.

Guess I'll, uh, head back to the Boo.

Don't rub it in. They told
me I'd be here all day.

Oh, that's terrible.

And I'm starving.

Oh, well, they have the little croissants
and the, uh, and the chocolate chip cookies.

Or, uh, maybe I could take
you out for a nice lunch.

That would be lovely, Alan. Thank you.

Well, terrific. Let's go.

This never happened with the Volvo.

It's 5:00.

Thanks. I almost slept
through happy hour.

Where's my little girl?

They're not back yet?

Why else would I be here?

Honestly, I was thinking happy hour.

Let me give Jake a call,
see what's keeping 'em.

Yeah, you do that.

Did you try calling your daughter?

She left her cell phone at the house.

Kids, huh?

It's ringing.

Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up

Yo, bitch, I'm gonna slap you up

Oh, that's unfortunate
on so many levels.

This is just
my pied- -terre.

I spend most of my time
out at the beach house.

Looks like you haven't
been here in a while.

Oh, just two weeks.

Don't you have someone to
come in to water your plants?

Oh, I do, but he's
incredibly unreliable.

My brother.

A bit of a mooch.

So, now that we're here,
what do you want to do?

Ah, gee, I don't know, I...

Oh, well, that's an option.

Oh, excuse me.

Alan Harper speaking.

I know who's speaking, you dill weed.

We've got a problem here.

Oh, really?

It's the mooch at the Boo.

So, uh, what's the problem?

Not the wine cellar again, is it?

What are you talking
aut, you gibbering moron?

Good, good.

Listen to me, your idiot
son's about to get me killed.

Oh, so he's okay?

He's great. Probably
having the time of his life.

I'm the one in trouble.

Uh, well, I-I-I trust
you to take care of it.

Thanks for the update.

Take a bottle of Pinot for yourself.

Alan?

My God, I thought there was an eclipse.

Excuse me, I need to go
to the bathroom again.

I knew it. You're married.

Oh, oh, no-no-no.
I'm not married.

This is, uh, this is just, uh...

A silk evening gown.

Actually, I think it's chiffon.

You men are all the same.

No, no, no, wait. Diane, Diane...

You've got the wrong idea.

There's something you
don't know about me.

- You're gay?
- No.

- You're a
cross-dresser? - No.

'Cause, you know, I could
really get into that.

Yes!

I'm a big, ol' cross-dresser.

Sorry it took so long.
I had a little accident.

Come on, you and me are going
to go out and find those kids.

- Jerome, Jerome, hang on.
- What?

Still pretty nimble.

Let's sit down, take a deep breath,
and talk this through for a minute.

Come on, big fella. Please?

Make it quick.

Okay, here's the deal.

Jake is harmless.You don't
have a thing to worry about,

unless your daughter's
made out of doughnuts.

Which I'm assuming she's not.

Look, Celeste is all I've got.

You don't know what it's
like being a single father.

You're right. I don't.

But I do know what it's like to
exploit women with daddy issues.

What the hell are you talking about?

Believe me, if you don't trust your
daughter to make her own decisions,

if you try to control her life, she's
just going to grow up to resent you.

And the next thing you know,

she'll be trying to punish you by going out with
some weaselly little con artist like, well, me.

And you can't kill us all.

I can try.

Let me start again.

Uh, uh, uh, are you sure
this is what you want?

Oh, yeah, baby. It's always
been one of my fantasies.

Oh, okay.Just a little heads-up:

I'm wearing the panties,
but I'm not bikini-safe.

Ugh, my ass looks huge in this.

Diane?

Oh, no.

Oh, no!

Not bad.

Oh, no! Oh, no!

Yes, yes, my car has been stolen.

Yes, just now. If you hurry, you ca...

Sure, I'll hold.

Why am I not surprised?

Did it have to be my red chiffon?

Then after I blew out
my knee, my wife left me.

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

For a place kicker.

Ooh, insult to injury.

A little, tiny dude from Serbia.

Not a single vowel in his entire name.

Oh, yeah, Grl Zrbnck.

That guy could sure split the uprights.

In a football manner of speaking.

And ever since then, it's
just been me and Celeste.

Sure, sure.

I don't know what I'd do if anything
ever happened to her, Charlie.

I'd go crazy.

I'd go crazy just thinking about it.

Well, then, for God's
sake, don't think about it.

Come on. Come on. Let's get you home.

Thanks, Charlie. You're okay.

No problem.

You just kick back and relax.

And when Celeste walks through that door, all
you've got to do is act like nothing's happened.

You think something happened?

No, no, no, nothing happened.

Which is why it's not really acting.

And it will show your
daughter that you trust her.

Okay, I'll give it a shot.

You won't be sorry. I promise.

Okay. Hey, come over to the house.

I've got a couple of tickets for
Sunday's game I want to lay on you.

Oh, you don't have to do that. I'll
just grab my keys. Okay, let's go.

Whatever happened to the guy you
tackled in the Tampa Bay game?

Robinson? He's walking again.

Celeste!

Hi, Dad.

Hey, Mr. Mad Dog.

Am I going to be walking again?

Listen, Jake.

I'm real proud that you stepped
up and got a little action tonight,

- but I've got to ask you something.
- What?

Are you out of your freakin' mind?

I'm sorry. We just lost track of time.

Yeah, well, thanks to you, I've got to
change my shorts for the second time today.

Oh, there's my phone.

- Who are you calling?
- Celeste.

No-no, no, no, no, no,
cool it with Celeste.

And change your ringtone.

Now what?

I'll be with you in a minute.

Jake, go to your room.

No matter what you
hear, do not come out.

- What?
- Just go!

Look, I spoke to the kid.

He's not going to bother
your daughter anymore.

So whatever you gotta do, do it to me.

I'm sorry, buddy.

I overreacted.

Okay.

Celeste told me everything.

She told me your boy was a perfect
gentleman and that she wanted to kiss him.

She wanted to kiss him?

You may have bigger
problems than you thought.

Hey, here's two tickets for the game.

You take Jake;I'll bring
Celeste. We'll make a day of it.

Oh, thanks. That's... that's great!

- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

Okay, well...See you Sunday.

Alan! Where's my car?!

Why are you wearing a dress?!

Alan!

Why aren't you in Mexico?!

.......... ********** ..........

Jake. You're hardly touching your salad.

I promised Berta I'd
cut down on the roughage.

Well, all right. Why
don't I get the soup.

Based on the salad, Im
not so optimistic.

So you have absolutely no
idea why she invited us here?

All she said on the phone was "dinner."

And you believed her?

Good God, man, do you
realize what you've done?

Just relax.

"Just relax"?

We'll be lucky to leave here
with all of our limbs and gonads.

What's a gonad?

You are.

So it's bad.

You're not a gonad.

Says the other gonad.

Here we go.

Potato leek soup.

Oh, delightful.

You got any crackers?

"Crackers"?

Yeah, I like having
something crunchy in my soup.

Little goldfish, crouton, a stale bagel...

I'll check. Go ahead and start.

Captain Crunch will work in a pinch.

I've got a bad feeling about this, Alan.

What? We're having a nice
dinner with our mother.

So you feel it, too?

What kind of person doesn't
serve crackers with soup?

The only thing I have that's
crunchy is macadamia nuts.

Interesting. Let's give her a try.

Well, I suppose you boys are
wondering why I asked you here.

You mean this isn't just
a nice, warm family dinner?

Knock it off, Charlie.

I have some good news.

And no, Im not dying.

I didn't say anything.

Why would you even go there?

Okay, Im sorry.

Anyway, I have been doing
some financial planning.

So you're thinking about dying?

Trust me darling, I promise to
stick around long enough to identify

your bloated, gin-soaked, syphilitic
remains.

Okay, so we've got a time frame.

So what about your financial plan?

Yes well, one thing I've done is
to set aside enough money to ensure

that my grandson will
get a college education.

You're gonna buy a college?

I have set up a trust fund.

Oh Mom, Mom, that is uh, that
is very generous,

but, uh I actually started a college
fund for Jake when he was born.

Really?

How much you have in there now?

Did you hear? Grandma's
sending you to college.

Now? I haven't finished my soup.

Mom, have you thought this through?

Look at him.

Maybe there should be
one child left behind.

Charlie, Charlie, shush.

Mom, I-I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate this.

Jake, do you understand what
your grandma is providing here?

Yeah, more school. Big whoop.

Well Jake perhaps this
will help enthuse you.

If you buckle down and your grades improve, when
the time comes for you to go to college,

Grand mommy is going
to buy you a new car.

I love you, Grandmommy!

By the way, when I get my car from Grandma, one
of you guys is gonna have to park on the street.

The car is for college.

And what makes you think
you'll still be living here?

Oh, come on, you know you love me.

He's got you there. You do love him.

Yeah, but he doesn't have
to rub my nose in it.

So what do you think Mom's angle is?

Does she have to have an angle?

A college trust fund? For him?

Last week he bit his
hand eating a sandwich.

He smelled the ham. He got excited.

Maybe she's just trying to buy his love.

Alan, think it through.

She could've done that with
a pork chop and a Creamsicle.

Well, whatever it is, it is a big load off my
mind knowing his education's taken care of.

Oh yeah, that's what Mom wants, to
take a load off your mind.

Okay, why do you think she did it?

I don't know. But if you
want to get inside her head,

you've got to start thinking
more twisted, manipulative, devious.

For example, if by some miracle he gets through
college and she sends him to law school...

L- law school?
You've already lost me.

Maybe she's boinking the dean of
admissions. We don't know. Just hear me out.

Go on.

Let's say he crawls through law school, takes
seven or eight shots at passing the bar.

We know how that ends.

So what are his options
as a failed lawyer?

I don't know. Government work?

Exactly. Maybe he lands
on the zoning commission.

And bingo-bango, Mom finally gets
to put a second story on her house.

You really think she's going to
send him to college and law school

just so she can add an extra bedroom?

That's insane.

Is it, Alan?

Is it really?

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

You having a stroke?

No, I'm just, I'm just trying to
figure out why I need to go to work today.

I mean, Moms taking care of
Jake's education, buying him a car.

Why should I bust my hump?

For your self-respect?

Nah, Judith got that in the divorce.

'Cause you like to heal people's back
pain with your chiropractic magic?

Okay,well you've got to go somewhere.

Why?

'Cause you're creeping me out.

I should take up motivational speaking.

Morning.

Something's wrong with your brother.

We don't say the word
"wrong." We say "special."

No, its true.

My friends don't think
you're my grandma.

They think you're my young aunt.

If he gets his nose any
further up her keister,

we're gonna have to
tie a rope to his feet.

Hey, I was thinking.

You know what would be a
nice, safe vehicle for me?

A used police car.

I don't know. I guess from the police?

She's buying Lunkhead a car?

And a college education.

Well, I guess that makes sense if it's
a clown college and the car seats 20.

All right, then I'll see
you in an hour. Hold on.

Nah, I don't need one.

Okay, okay, bye.

I'm gonna spend the afternoon with
Grandma. If she asks, I took a shower.

Figured out her angle yet?

No. And that's what scares me.

Bom-bom-bom.

Seemed appropriate.

All right, Mr. Sharipa.

How's it feel right here?

A little tender.

Yeah, yeah, you've got a spasm right here.

It's my own fault.

I was trying to do it in the
shower with Mrs. Sharipa last night.

The woman is no ballerina.

Well, sex in the shower is
really a young man's game.

Or a middle-aged man
with a skinny wife.

Sure.

What can I say?

I like a little junk in the trunk.

I,I think that says it.

Slap her on the ass at Christmas,

it doesn't stop shaking
till New Year's Eve.

Just between you and me, she enjoys
a little spanking from Santa.

Who doesn't?

I check the list twice: always naughty.

Could you, turn on
your right, Mr. Sharipa.

I'll, try to relieve the
pressure on your sciatic nerve.

Would you cross your
arms, please? Thank you. Okay.

Excuse me.

Oh, no, that happens.

It's, uh, it's perfectly natural...

Oh, dear Lord.

Yeah, that's the garlic
clams I had for lunch.

I like them. They don't like me.

Um, if you'll just
excuse me for a moment.

Hey, you know, I feel better.

Maybe that's where
the pressure came from.

- Where are you going, Dr. Harper?
- Home.

Will you be coming back?

Dr. Harper?

Oh, my God.

Let's spend a little time
talking about our college plans.

"Our plans"? Are you going, too?
'Cause that changes everything.

I've already been to college, darling.

And they were some of the
happiest years of my life.

Really?

What kind of car did you have?

Look, Jake, I understand that
you're excited about getting a car,

but keep in mind the car is
predicated on you getting into college.

Right.

What's "predicated" mean?

No college, no car.

What if I flunk out? Do I
have to give the car back?

Oh sweetheart, what makes
you think you'd flunk out?

Well, history.

Right now there's a 60/60 chance I'm
gonna have to repeat eighth grade.

60/60,huh?

At least. It could be 70/40.

Well, we can rule out the Ivy League.

- Is that good?
- For the Ivy League.

You know dear, maybe we're
going about this the wrong way.

College should be about
pursuing the things you love.

What do you love?

TV, video games, sleeping.

I love sleeping so much sometimes
I actually dream about it.

Okay, maybe I wasn't clear enough.

Oh, you know what I really love?

Twice-dipped French toast with
a sprinkling of orange zest.

Orange zest?

Yeah, you scrape it from an orange peel.

It's what really makes my recipe work.

- You have a recipe?
- Yep.

It kinda happened by accident.

I was making once-dipped
French toast, but I dropped it.

A lot of great discoveries are accidents
like Thomas Edison and the telephone.

That wasn't Thomas...

So you like to cook?

Yeah, I love it. 'Cause, you know, I love
to eat and I love to surprise my mouth.

Well, you know, dear, what you are
talking about is becoming a chef,

and there are schools for that, and-and
the potential to make a terrific living.

Do I get to wear one
of those poofy hats?

- If you want to.
- Cool.

Then I guess I'll be a chef.

My grandson the chef.

I can live with that.

You know what I could
drive if I was a chef?

The Oscar Mayer Weiner mobile.

I got a kayak.

I see.

Guess what I'm gonna do?

Go kayaking?

Yep. I have decided
that life is too short.

So you're going out in the
Pacific Ocean in a plastic boat.

Good thinking.

No, I was at work today and it
suddenly became clear to me that...

Sorry about that.

It became clear to me that
I don't like what I'm doing.

And now that Mom is taking care of Jake,

I can spend my time doing
the things that give me joy.

So you're gonna masturbate in a kayak?

No, but that's the point.

You'll have to elaborate.

I could if I wanted to.

Yeah, who could've seen that coming?

Look, Im sorry.

Here you go. Grilled cheese
with gouda, Swiss and monster.

You mean muenster.

No, thats an old TV show.

And they're called that
'cause they're monsters.

This is a cheese.

Anyway, the sandwich also has heirloom tomatoes
and smoked applewood bacon on sourdough toast.

Where did you learn this?

Food Channel and FoodChannel. com.

Food Channel on
Demand, Food Channel magazine.

And the school lunch lady.

Oh, and save room for
homemade potato chips.

You're making potato chips?

Oh yeah, it's easy.

You slice the potatoes real thin, rub
the slices with lemon and garlic,

fry 'em up in a hot iron
skillet and then salt to taste.

- I can't get over this.
- Bon appetite.

Teet.

No, thats a cow's boob.

Oh, my goodness. This is delicious.

Don't eat more than three
or you won't poop for a week.

Trust me.

Well, at least we have finally
found a career path for you.

Cool. I'll go get the chips
and then we'll talk about cars.

You know what? Let's
settle this car thing first.

Oh God, it was incredible.

The-the wind, the sky, the surf.

I feel like I'm reborn.

You were out there for 15 minutes.

Yeah well, my arms got tired.

so you did decide to
go with the kayanking.

- What?
- Masturyaking?

You're terrible.

But anyway, no one could see me.

So now what?

Now? Now I just live. I enjoy.

All right.

This rat has quit the race.

Good for you.

This hamster is off the treadmill.

Glad to hear it.

This squirrel is satisfied
with the nuts he has.

No comment.

I'm not gonna make it, Charlie.

Didn't think you would.

No goals, no challenges, no, no
gut-wrenching fear driving me forward.

I mean, how can you stand it?

Me? Well, I have kind of an existential
philosophy that shapes my outlook.

It involves a willingness to let
life carry me along in its wake

as I contemplate its infinite mystery.

Plus I drink and take a lot of naps.

Yeah well, I need something
meaningful to strive for.

Sorry, I don't follow.

I need a carrot in front
of me and a stick behind me.

Without that, I... I
have no reason to live.

That's it!

What's it?

"No reason to live."

That's Mom's angle.

This never had anything to do with Jake.

She's trying to kill you.

Oh, come on.

Think about it.

She takes the financial
pressure off your shoulders,

knowing you can't live
without it. Oh, she's good.

Why would Mom want to kill me?

I don't know. Why do I want to kill you?

Why does your ex-wife want to kill you?

You just bring that out in people.

You're being ridiculous.

Okay, okay, let's look at
the alternate explanation.

For the first time in her life,

our mother is being totally selfless and
thinking about someone else's well-being.

Dear God, my own mother
is trying to kill me.

Well, Im glad we got that settled.

It was really bugging me.

- Terrific sandwich.
- Yeah.

I think you'll find the fire gave
everything a nice smoky flavor.

Just out of curiosity, what
does a used fire truck go for?

Hey Alan, I got an idea
that might cheer you up.

I'm listening.

You need a carrot and a stick
to make your life meaningful?

How about this?

Every month I let you give me a
small amount of money in exchange

for the pleasure of living in my house.

We'll call it... rent.

Wow, its been a long
time since I paid rent.

Five years, two months,11 days.

Interesting. It would certainly
give me a reason to go back to work.

Right. That's the carrot.

And if you fall behind, I
get to hit you with a stick.

Very funny.

No, Im serious. That's my carrot.

Okay, how much did you have in mind?

Well, Ive given it some thought...

and...

I think you'll find
this to be a fair number.

Oh well, uh, at least if I'm paying rent
I'll get a say in what goes on around here.

No,no,no,no,no,no. No.

If you want a say, this is the number.

I don't need a say.

Good. So, every month on the first.

Deal.

All right, all right, I feel good about
this, pitching in, pulling my own weight.

It's long overdue.

Five years, two months,11 days.

Right.

Uh,of  course since the month has already
started, we'll, we'll start next month.

Fine.

Uh, although, uh, with the holidays coming,

maybe it'd be better to start fresh
with the new year, you know? 1/1.

- Sure, whatever.
- Okay.

Unless the economy's still in the tank.

Always a possibility.

In which case, you know, we'll, uh, we'll
probably want to revisit the number.

Probably.

I mean, the market is-is
pretty volatile right now.

I mean, I think some belt-tightening
is in order for everybody,

you know, landlords
and-and tenants alike.

.......... ********** ..........

Check it out. They got cars
that run on vegetable oil now.

How about that.

You know what would be cool? A
Hummer that runs on French fry grease.

We could be energy independent
and still smash through crap.

Sounds great.

Plus, the new car smell is French fries.

Okay, I'm only gonna
say this one more time.

You don't get your license for two more
years and you're not getting a Hummer.

You know, you say you want me to
open up to you, but what's the point?

Yeah, I always loved
Paris in the springtime.

Oh, you're lucky.

I only got to do her once, on Halloween.

Oh, hey, Alan.

Andy, this is my
brother Alan. Alan, Andy.

- Hello.
- Hey, Andy.

Pull up a chair. We're
just telling war stories.

Oh, great.

- The sponge?
- Yeah.

So, uh, how do you guys know each other?

- Well, Andy and I--
- Can I have a cigar?

- Sure, help yourself.
- Thank you.

Anyway, Andy and I
have known each other--

Maybe I'll take one for
now and one for later.

Anyway, before he moved to New York,
Andy and I were partners in crime.

There weren't that many actual crimes.

Unless you count the
ones against nature.

Alan, this is a great man.

No, no, Albert Einstein was a great man.

I just drink, gamble and hump.

But I'm great at it.

Andy once managed to hitchhike from
Vegas to L.A., wearing no pants.

Hey, anybody can use their thumb.

This right here, this is
the brother I never had.

Oh, well, how nice for you.

I don't mean it that way.

- You're my brother.
- Well, thank you.

I just like him better.

Got it.

Andy is the one guy in the world that can
match me drink for drink and broad for broad.

In fact, the one time I thought
I drank him under the table,

it turned out he had
a broad under there.

Right, Andy?

Andy?

Don't screw with me, dude.

Who's your favorite brother now?

So, he died right out
there in the chair, huh?

Yep.

Remind me to flip that cushion.

You should've seen it, Berta.

The paramedics zipped him
up in a big plastic bag.

Is that so?

It looked like one of those things the
delivery guys use to keep pizza hot.

I wonder if they got him to the
morgue in 30 minutes or less.

Not funny, Jake.

Maybe it is funny and
you just didn't get it.

Eat.

So, uh, did you know him?

Andy? Sure.

Before he moved to New York, he
and Charlie were just like brothers.

Yeah, I heard that part.

How's Charlie taking it?

He's pretty shook up.

Well, you can understand why.

Somebody your age, living the same dumbass
lifestyle you live keels over and dies.

It's gotta give you pause.

You're right about that.

Actually, I'm surprised
that Charlie didn't go first.

Excuse me.

I'm standing right here.

But for how long?

Did you get that one?

I'll see you later.

Where you going?

Where do you think? My
best friend just died.

I got a lot of things to take care of.

You're handling the funeral?

I'm sure Andy would like that.

The hell with Andy.

I'm going to the hospital to get
every damn medical test known to man.

Good one.

You're not getting
any of these, are you?

Hey, how'd the tests go?

I won't know for a couple of days.

All right, I'm outta here.

How about you, Charlie?

Wait, I got something for you.

It's a gift certificate for a
week at a spa in Palm Springs.

Well, I'll be. Thank you, Charlie.

I just wand you to know that I love you and
appreciate that you've always been there for me.

Great, see you in a week.

Look at you.

The minute you start
thinking about your mortality,

you realize how much you care
about the people around you.

Yeah, and I need to start showing it.

Well, little gifts are always a
nice way to express your feelings.

I know.

Could be as simple as a cashmere
robe or as extravagant as a new car.

Yeah, I suppose it could.

Excuse me, I got something
really cool for Jake.

Doesn't even have to be new!

Certified pre-owned is
still very thoughtful!

Hey, what are you doing?

I was trying to research cars, but you wouldn't
believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."

Actually, I would.

Here, I got you something I
think you're really gonna like.

wich?

*****

'Cause you want me to be surprised?

Just open it.

You know what's a great
sandwich? The Monte Cristo.

'Cause it has ham and
cheese and it's fried.

Open the damn box.

Whoa, don't get your period.

Oh, wow, a mini video camera.

Pretty cool, huh?

Is this 'cause you think you're dying?

No, no. I just wanted to
do something nice for you.

Before you die.

Do you want the camera or not?

Yeah, I want it.

Then just say thank you.

Thank you. Geez.

You need to relax. You'll
give yourself a heart attack.

I'll work on it.

Have a sandwich. That always relaxes me.

All right, one more gift to give.

Oh, yeah? Saving the best for last?

I don't know about the best,
but it's sure the hardest.

Any way I can make it easier?

Yeah.

Call Mom and tell her
I'm on my way over.

Oh, Charlie, what a beautiful watch!

Do you really like it?

Are you kidding? It's gorgeous!

And the best part is now I don't
have to wear my good one every day.

Anyway, you're probably
wondering why I bought it for you.

Well, I just assumed you love me and
did it out of the goodness of your heart.

I'm kidding. Why, dear?

Okay, I deserve that.

But the truth is I do love you and despite our
many differences, I'm glad you're my mother.

You didn't drive over
here drunk, did you?

I'm not drunk. I just...

I've been thinking a lot
about how fleeting life is,

and that none of us really knows
how long we're gonna be here.

Did you find another
lump on your pee-pee?

No, Mom, my pee-pee's fine.

I don't know how "worn down to a
nub" can be fine, but all right.

My point is, I don't want
to be angry with you anymore.

I want us to be friends.

I was always your friend, Charlie.

You were just too
self-involved to see it.

Okay, I got to go.

Where you off to?

I have to pick out a
casket for a friend of mine.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Yeah, well, what are you gonna do.

Don't cheap out.

It's one thing to do it with a
watch, but a casket is forever.

So young. I can't believe it.

Yeah...

Who'd have thought smoking,
drinking and whoring could kill you?

You realize that could just
as easily be me in there.

Yeah.

Don't even think that.

It is a nice casket, though.

Should be. It cost me ten grand.

Ten grand? Wow.

What can I say? I take
care of the people I love.

Could've taken care of
me with a freakin' robe.

Kind of a light turnout.

You'd probably get more
people with an open bar.

Hey, make sure there's
an open bar at mine.

Oh, now I'm your funeral planner?

Don't you want a friend or someone you
really care about in charge of that?

No, you do it.

Good afternoon and welcome.

We are here to celebrate the
life and mourn the passing

of Andrew Donald Patterson.

How do we measure a man's life?

Geez, this guy's a load.

Don't get a guy like this for me.

I want someone with a
little bit of gravitas.

I'll see if James Earl
Jones is available.

That would be nice.

"...a time to die,a time to reap,"

"a time to sow,a time to mourn..."

"...a time to heal."

"a time for every purpose under heaven."

And so we say goodbye to
Charles Francis Harper.

Devoted son, loving
brother, caring uncle.

Bon vivant and world-class
connoisseur of the booty.

Nice turnout.

Yeah, man. Standing room only.

Goes to show you, give
the people what they want.

You mean the open barright?

Sure.

Thanks for coming, by the way.

Well, you came to mine.

Yeah, but you're dead.

Charlie, take a look in the box.

That's not a tanning booth.

Oh, yeah.

So, listen, as long as you're
here-- what's Heaven like?

It's unbelievable. It's paradise.

Like your house. Before
your brother moved in.

Oh, that was good.

You can drink all you want
and there's no hangover.

Endless supply of women, each one more
beautiful than the last, and, Charlie, get this:

they believe everything you tell 'em.

Everything?

It's Heaven, dude.

Well, save me a good seat.

I wish I could, but that's
not where they sent me.

Then how do you know what Heaven's like?

They make us look at a video every day,
while they're putting lube on the pitchfork.

Well, at least you get lube.

Only on the little prong.

To be completely honest, I
didn't know Charlie Harper,

but any man who, with his dying
breath, would set aside $25,000

and a first-class air ticket,
so I could deliver his eulogy...

is aces in my book!

That being said, uh...

there are many people here
today who did know Charlie,

and perhaps some of them would like
to stand up and say a few words.

I want to say something.

Hello, everybody.

Hello, James Earl Jones.

hey, bro. Don't get up.

What can I say about Charlie?

Uh, so many words come to mind--
so few that you can say in church.

But we'll give it a shot.

Charlie was a man of love.

Um, he loved his friends;
he loved his family;

but, most of all, he loved his penis...

the only part of him that
ever had an actual job.

Well, anyway...

this was a man so full of love that
it practically oozed out of him,

at which point, of course,
he would see a doctor.

But I kid the deceased whoremonger.

Anyway...since he never made out a will,

I hope you will all join me for a
wake-slash-luau at my Malibu beach house!

He got my house?

He got everything you had.

Everything?

Well, not the diseased liver
and the swollen prostate.

Oh, look, your old girlfriends
are saying their final goodbye.

That's not very respectful.

Just FYI-- spit is
the Devil's lube.

Listen, would you mind recording
my answering machine message for me?

That'll be an extra $500.

That's okay. I'm rich now.

Well, what do you want: "This is
CNN" or "Luke, I am your father"?

So, Charlie, it's been great
catching up but I gotta go.

Already? Can't you stay awhile?

No. It's pitchfork time.

If you're late, you don't get the spit.

And, believe me, Charlie,
you want the spit.

I want the spit!

Harper. Charlie Harper.
It was in a few days ago.

I peed in a cup; you took my blood and
slipped a camera up the heart of darkness.

You know, the doctor said my
results would beeady today.

Fine. Have him get back to me.

He's avoiding my calls, Alan.

I'm gonna die.

No. No you're not.

I can feel it.

You might as well just drive
into that tree and kill us both.

Sure. I don't want to
go on living without you.

What's the point of it all?

Yeah, I'm rich, charming,
classically handsome.

I've laid more pipe than a
guy who has sex with pipes.

But what have I done with my life?

A few stupid jingles; some kids'
songs-- nothing that really matters.

Now, now, you're being
too hard on yourself.

I've got no wife,
I've got no children...

I'm going leave this
world the way I came in...

By Cesarean section?

Alone.

Oh, for God sakes, Charlie, I
am tired of listening to this.

There has always been one person in your life who's
been there for you and loved you unconditionally.

You mean...

You're right.

How could I have missed it?

It's been in front of me the whole time!

Well, you know, sometimes you
can't see the forest for the trees,

even when the forest
is in your own backyard.

Or guest room.

Rose?

Yep, the one and only.

I know, I know. It's been awhile.

I was thinking, if you're not too busy, maybe
we can get together, have a drink or something?

Well, great!

So, do you want to meet,
or should I pick you up?

Okay, I'll meet you back at my place.

Small world.

Yeah. Teeny-tiny.

- Here you go.
- Thank you, Charlie.

- You comfy?
- Oh, very.

Good.

So, Rose...

Charlie...

Haven't seen you in awhile.

Can't say the same.

Right, uh, sure.

Sorry about your friend.

Yeah, yeah, it was a
real wake-up call for me.

I can imagine.

Makes you stop and wonder
what's important in your life.

Who's important in your life.

I've always known who's
important in my life.

You have, haven't you.

You know how I feel about you, right?

Tell me anyway.

Oh, okay.

Well, as you know, we've
had our ups and downs.

I told you that was my medication.

I was talking about our relationship.

Yes. That's had ups and
downs, too. Continue.

Well, uh, I'm thinking,
we're not getting any younger.

You know, there was a time when
I did think I was getting younger

but it turns out that
that was my medication.

Sure.

I also thought that
I was getting smaller.

Anyway, uh, it struck me that life is...

short, and maybe the time has come for you
and I to start thinking about our future.

What about it?

Well...

I know this is kind of sudden, but...

Rose...

Yes, Charlie?

Would you do me the honor of...

I'm sorry. Let me just get rid of this.

Oh, it's my doctor.

Hey, Doc. What's the word?

No liver damage whatsoever?

What about my heart?

Well, that's terrific!

Lungs are good, too?

So I don't have to give up cigars?

No, no, no, I won't overdo it.

Just when I drink.

Speaking of which--
how's the plumbing?

Does that include the prostate?

Yes.

All right, well, uh, thanks
for getting back to me so soon.

And, again, I'm sorry for all the name
calling when you slipped your finger up there.

Oh, boy, this is awkward.

Look at him-- he's
gonna live forever.

Nah, it's just gonna seem like forever.

He smokes, he drinks, he
parties like there's no tomorrow.

Me?

I have Mexican food and a couple
of beers and I'm farting blood.

Yeah, boo-hoo.

You just said Mexican food
and I grew a third butt cheek.

Life isn't fair, is it, Berta?

If it were, you'd be cleaning my
toilets and I'd have my own talk show.

A talk show?!

Why not? I'm personable.

Well, at least he has a clean
bill of health. I'm happy for that.

Me, too.

I don't care if I never
inherit this house.

Uh, uh... excuse me?

Oh, you ain't seen his new will, huh?

Uh, what new will?

Never mind.

But in case tragedy strikes,

be prepared to clear your
crap out of here in 48 hours.

Son of a bitch.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

.......... ********** ..........

Allright, Mrs. Freemantle we will see you next week.

Oh, thank you, Dr. Harper.

And remember,no more rough sex.

Oh, Dr. Harper, you're terrible.

Okay. Bye-bye.

I wish I was kidding;
the woman's a freak.

You are so good with
the patients, Dr. Harper.

Oh, thank you.

Just you're
- you're warm and personable and funny.

Oh, I'm all right.

But you, the patients love you.

- No.
- Uh, don't give me "no."

- I'm giving you "no."
- Well, I'm not taking "no."

- Don't make me blush.
- I'm making you blush.

Well, I'm blushing.

So we all done for the day?

Yeppers. Mrs. Freemantle
was our last patient.

Okay, then, uh, I will see
your smiling face tomorrow.

Well, it's only smiling
'cause it's looking at you.

Don't make me blush.

- Well, I'm making you blush.
- Well, I'm blushing.

I'm so sorry.

I should apologize.

No, I'm the one who
stepped over the line.

No, no, I stepped, too.

- No, no, I stepped first.
- No, no, no.

Don't give me "no, no."

I'm giving you "no, no."

We can't do this.

I'm sorry, I can't help it.

I ache for you.

Yeah, well, I'm not all that
comfortable right now either.

- It-it-it's just that I feel
like... - You don't have to explain.

I understand.

Okay. Okay. Well, then, uh, I
guess I will see you tomorrow.

I'll be here at, uh, 7:30.

In case you want to get in early.

Oh, okay. Uh, I-I might
actually want to... get in early.

You're the boss. You can
get in anytime you want.

Oh, God.

DeSto proudly presents:

Two and a Half Men Season06 Episode12

Mind if I watch the game?

Uh, actually, I came in
here for a little quiet time.

Still quieter than sleeping
under the Santa Monica Pier.

I'm conflicted, Charlie.

Shh, quiet time.

Do you think you can
choose who you love?

Oh, boy.

What's his name?

What? No!

Oh, all right. Come
out when you're ready.

Do you remember my receptionist?

The itsy bitsy spider who
climbed up my water spout?

Yeah. Whatever happened to her?

You dumped her after one depraved
weekend, and I had to give her a raise,

health insurance and a paid
vacation to keep her from quitting.

Oh, good. Thanks for
smoothing that over for me.

Hey, you think she has
plans for this weekend?

What is wrong with you?

Uh, I am trying to tell you that I'm
starting to have feelings for her.

For who?

For Melissa.

Who's Melissa?

My receptionist!

So I should forget about this weekend?

Yes, you should forget
about this weekend!

I was just asking. You don't
have to bite my head off.

So you and her are, uh...

Oh, no, no, no, nothing's happened yet.

Just a little kissing,
and she could feel my...

enthusiasm.

What, are you Noel
Coward? Just say "boner."

Why do I bother talking to you?

Beats the hell out of me.

The thing is, Melissa and
I have-have this chemistry,

and it's really hard not to act on it.

Yeah, it's tough when you work together.

Right.

- You don't crap where you eat.
- I know.

You don't dip your pen in company ink.

And you never bang a woman
who owns a snake or a bird.

What?

They're usually nuts.

So what you're faced with
here is a moral dilemma.

Oh, I'll say.

Whether or not to have an intimate relationship
with a woman who is also your employee.

Exactly.

- I got it, I got it.
- Oh, you do?

Fire her, then boink her.

I don't got it?

You don't got it.

I'm right about the
snakes and birds though.

Really? The one who works for him?

Yep.

Tinkerbell with the knockers?

The same.

Well, everybody makes that mistake once.

I crossed that line in the '70s when I
was cleaning house for Mr. Telly Savalas.

No kidding. TV's Kojak?

One and the same.

What happened?

What do you think happened?
He's Greek, a man of passion.

You can't tie your
shoes around those guys.

That's rough.

Bet your ass it's rough.

- Morning.
- Morning.

So, Zippy, I hear you've been sinking
your putts on the company golf course.

Thanks for telling her.

Thanks for telling me.

Word of advice: it may seem like
fun and games at the beginning,

but mark my words, sooner or later,
you're gonna wake up with a broken heart

and a lollipop stuck to your keister.

You want to explain that to me?

I'd rather forget I ever heard it.

So, decide what you're
gonna do about Melissa?

There's nothing to do.

I have to take the physical
feelings I have for her

and channel them into something creative,
productive, something, something that'll last.

You're gonna have sex with the
vacuum cleaner again, aren't you?

That wasn't sex, that was an accident.

Once is an accident.

Morning, Melissa.

Good morning, Dr. Harper.

How's my schedule look today?

It's packed pretty tight.

Oh, okay. Uh, tight's good.

You know, better-better
tight than, uh, you know...

Thank God for scoliosis.

Um, listen, Melissa, um, about
what happened yesterday...

Please, Dr. Harper, you
don't have to say anything.

Yes, yes, I do.

We obviously have feelings
for each other, and...

there's nothing wrong with that. It's-it's
a beautiful thing. It's-it's natural.

But for us to maintain a-a working
relationship, and I hope friendship,

I-I think it would be unwise
to succumb to those feelings.

I agree.

Oh, good, good. I'm glad.

Oh, well, now we got
that out of the way...

Uh, what time does my
packed schedule begin?

Uh, not for a half hour.

Half hour?

Yeppers.

Nothing for a half hour?

Wide open.

Everything work out at the office?

Manage to keep your hands
off Really Little Annie Fanny?

Well, not exactly, but, uh,
we did keep it above the waist.

Her waist or yours?

Both. And it wasn't easy.

I haven't checked, but I'm pretty sure my balls
look like two-thirds of the Blue Man Group.

Berta, hide the vacuum cleaner!

For the last time, I use it
to get lint off my trousers.

Then why do you call it Brenda?

So when the mood strikes and
she's ready, you'll be ready, too.

Ready today, ready
tonight, ready tomorrow.

I'm ready now.

What's he ready for?

If I were to guess, I'd say he's ready
to screw up his life a little more.

Is that even possible?

We'll see.

I'm hungry.

So eat something.

There's nothing here I like.

Welcome to my world.

****

*******

Am I even allowed to be in a bar?

Probably not. So if anybody
asks, you're a homely lesbian.

Why do I have to be homely?

Just sit down.

What's that smell?

Stale beer, vomit, urine. You hungry?

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi, Janine. This is my nephew Jake.

Hey, Jake. How old are you, sweetheart?

Keep your hands off him,
Janine, he's married.

I thought I was a lesbian.

We're just gonna have a couple of
hamburgers and a basket of fries,

he'll have a soda and I'll have a draft.

That's not a very healthy
dinner for a growing boy.

Well, don't worry, he
can process anything.

The other day, he ate a
handful of packing peanuts.

You bet me ten bucks I wouldn't.

Oh, Charlie, shame on you.

Yeah, shame on you.

Tell you what, Jake, I get
out of here in ten minutes.

Why don't you get your uncle
to bring you over to my place,

and I'll cook you a
nice, healthy dinner?

Thanks, but I'm already
healthy. I'll have a hamburger.

No, you won't. We'll be there.

I don't get a vote?

You're lucky you're getting
dinner. Thanks, Janine.

You're welcome.

What is wrong with
you, turning that down?

Excuse me, but we have no
idea what kind of cook she is.

Oh, God...

For all we know, she's a vegetarian.

Dr. Harper, what are you doing here?

What do you think I'm doing here?

Please don't make me guess.

I'm making you guess.

Correct.

Melissa, honey, who's here?

Uh, Mom, this is my boss, Dr. Harper.

Dr. Harper, this is my mother.

- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

I understand there's been some
inappropriate behavior in the workplace.

Yeah, well, about that, I-I-I just want you to know
that I have nothing but respect for your daughter,

and I would never do anything...

I'm just yankin' your chain!

Ain't nothin' wrong
with beddin' the boss.

That's how I wound up with the little
princess here and half a Black Angus franchise.

Come on in. I'm watchin' Hellboy.

Okay. Thanks.

You smoke dope?

This is, like, the best dinner ever.

I'm glad you liked it, Jake.

You are a great cook.

And you are a cutie pie.
I could just eat you up.

- Want another root beer?
- Sure.

Comin' right up.

Listen, buddy, you're gonna
have to make yourself scarce.

Maybe take a cab home.

You take a cab home. I'm doin' great.

How do you figure?

You blind? First base on the top
of my head, second base in my ear?

Listen to me, knucklehead.

That woman's got to be
ten years older than you.

So? You're, like, 15
years older than her.

Step aside, grandpa.

Okay, fun time's over.
Go wait in the car.

You go wait in the car.

- No, you go.
- No, you go.

Jake, how about I put some ice cream
in that root beer and make it a float?

Thank you. That'd be great.

It's like she can read my mind.

Go get in the car.

Fine, I'll just go tell Janine that
you want me to wait in the car by myself

so you can try and have sex with her.

Sit down, you little bastard.

Now, this picture here is
toward the end of my labor.

That's my vagina,

and that's Melissa's little head
pokin' out of me like a groundhog.

Hey, I guess if she'd seen her shadow, I
would've had six more weeks of labor, huh?

It's funny.

You know, of all my
kids, she was the easiest.

Just like popping out a ping-pong ball.

That's quite an image.

Yeah, oh, and it was a
natural childbirth, too.

No drugs, just a couple of peyote
buttons and bitin' down on a rope.

Mom, would you mind if Dr. Harper
and I have a little time alone?

I'm sorry, honey.

You kids must be as horny as
a couple of drunken rabbits.

Enjoy.

Oh, uh, Kama Sutra's on the bookshelf
case you feel like pushin' the envelope.

I'm sorry about that.

Mom never really made
it home from Woodstock.

Don't be silly. She's delightful.

I'm just gonna close this up now.

Don't mind me.

I'm just gonna a roll a fatty in the
backyard and zone out in the hammock.

Ah, that hit the spot.

I'm glad you liked it.

The best part of a root beer
float? Your burps taste good.

Listen, Janine, thanks for everything,

but I should probably get this
little guy home and come back.

It's way past his bedtime.

What are you talking about?
It's not past my bedtime.

What do you wanna bet he falls asleep
in the car and I have to carry him in?

What do you wanna bet he has to go home and take
a laxative because he's too old to poop normal?

- All right, that's it!
- Not in the face! Not in the face!

What? Stop that! He's
kidding. I never hit him.

Jake, tell her you're kidding.

I'm kidding about that, but
he can be verbally abusive.

Not funny, Jake.

The liquor makes him mean.

Okay, I didn't want to have to do this,

but I am calling your
father, let him deal with you.

I'm gonna go straighten
up in the kitchen.

You don't know who you're messing with.

Are you kidding? I think she's gorgeous!

You don't know who you're messin' with.

I'm sorry about that. Hang on.

Charlie, now is not a good time.

All right, put him on.

I can't talk now, Dad. I'm about
to get lucky with an older woman.

What? Where are you? Jake? Jake?

Alan, would you be totally weirded out
by a little mother-daughter tag team?

I hope you're happy.

I hopeyou'rehappy.

I could've been happy.

u gonna tell me what happened tonight?

You don't wanna know.

Where are you going?

I'm a 14-year-old boy
who recently got ear-boob.

Where do you think I'm going?

Ear-boob?

You don't wanna know.

So how'd it go with Melissa?

You don't wanna know.

Oh, come on.

All right. I met her mom,saw
a photo of mom's vagina,

and chose to leave before being
introduced to the real thing.

You're right,I didn't wanna know.

Where are you going?

I'm a 40-year-old
guy who recently...

Ah, screw it.I'm gonna
go play with myself.

Okay,thatI didn't want to know.

Still not a bad idea.

30 days has September,
all the rest have 31,

except for Judith, who has 28.

Hey, Alan. Meet Don.

Hello, Don.

Hello, Alan.

Don drove me home and
I don't have any money.

Okay, uh, is Don a cabbie?

No, no. Don is a close, personal friend.

Don is a cabbie. He has enough
friends, and he wants his $80.

What happened to your money?

Good question.

You know how easy Texas Hold 'Em looks on TV
when you can see the other guys' hole cards?

Yeah.

Very different in real life.

Uh, 20, 40, 60, 80.

No tip?

Hold on.

Let's see, five dollars...

Keep your money, Mr. Trump
You need it more than I do.

Are we still on for lunch?

I think you offended Don.

He'll get over it. Where's your car?

Don't change the subject.
You owe Don an apology.

- Oh, hey, a calendar.
- Yeah.

- What's "JMC" stand for?
- Nothing.

Oh, come on. John Mellencamp Cougar?

No.

Jumping Methodist... cougar?

No.

Then I give up.

Well, if you must know, it stands
for "Judith's menstrual cycle."

Get out.

No, look. This is when
Judith and Herb broke up.

And this is the day
that I had sex with her.

Dude... you need a better hobby.

Judith is now five months pregnant.

Oh, yeah, right.

She's probably in that sweet spot where her boobs
are big and cushy but her ass is still normal.

Charlie, it is almost certain that
I am the father of Judith's baby.

Are you still grinding on this?

What if it's a girl? I
always wanted a daughter.

I finally get one and some
other guy gets to be her dad.

I feel like the universe is playing
some horrible practical joke on me.

I lost $8,000 playing poker.

I have no idea where my car is,
threw up in my mouth three times,

and I'm still having a
better night than you are.

I don't expect you to understand.

You don't know the
joy of being a parent.

Of watching a part of you grow and develop,
blooming into a fully formed human being.

Four times.

Jake, your father's here.

- So, how you doing?
- Good.

- Over the morning sickness?
- Yes, Alan.

Uh, by my calculations probably
about a week, ten days ago?

That sounds right.

Good, good. You have a nice break till the,
uh, till the old hemorrhoids come a-callin'.

Jake1

Judith, are we gonna talk
about the elephant in the room?

What elephant?

Come on, you, me, the baby?

- I mean, we did have unprotected sex...
- You shut your mouth. We did not.

Yes, we did.

Read my lips. We did not have sex.

Oh, hey, Alan. How goes it?

Oh, uh, fine, Herb. Uh, how you doing?

Proud as a peacock.

- Honey, did you show him the sonogram?
- No.

- Oh, you should see her, Alan.
- Her? So, it is a girl?

Yep, one fresh-faced
little fetus sans wee-wee.

I always wanted a sans wee-wee.

Well, you can't have mine.

No, no, of course not.

Hey, wanna see how we're
decorating the nursery?

He doesn't wanna see the nursery, Herb.

Sure I would. You going with
mermaids? Little girls love mermaids.

Actually, I was thinking little ponies.

- Little ponies?
- Yeah, why?

Oh, gosh... Little ponies
have little penises.

Really? I didn't notice
that on the stencils.

- Let's go take look.
- I'm ready.

Oh, uh, I'll be right back. I'm
just going to go see the baby's room.

He never wants to see my room.

That's because your room is a pig sty.

I didn't ask for a reason.

Alan, buddy, I'm getting a little
concerned about your drinking.

I don't have a problem.

Well, I do. You're
swillin' my good stuff.

Here. Have some Old Wal-Mart.

Thank you.

What's this?

Ugh, a diary I kept
during Judith's pregnancy.

Jennifer, Jocelyn, Jasmine, Jolene?

Some of the names that we picked
out in case Jake had been a girl.

Oh, man, can you imagine him as a chick?

Woof1

Yeah, well, that's
not how it turned out.

Think about it though.

Every weekend, me, you and a
big ugly girl with a bad haircut.

I'm gonna have a daughter, Charlie.

Okay, okay, first of all,
you don't know it's your kid.

All we know is that when Judith
and Herb broke up you nailed Judith.

Then when they reconciled,
Herb nailed Judith.

So, the only thing we know for sure is that
despite all outward appearances, Judith is a slut.

Hey, I'm aware that technically
either one of us could be the father,

but I know in my gut that
this is my sweet bastard child.

You don't know squat.

And you wanna talk technically?

Technically, maybe neither
one of you is the father.

Oh, dear God, Charlie.
What have you done?

Not me, you fool.

- Although if I had known she was that easy, may...
- Stop1

All I'm saying is there could very
well be some guy in her driveway

with a leaf blower pining
away for "baby Juanita."

That's just ridiculous. Judith
won't even eat Mexican food.

Look, even if you're right, doing anything
about it, it's just gonna destroy a marriage.

I know, I know. It's just... it's so
hard to ignore my paternal instincts.

Sure, I see those instincts
with Jake and I admire them.

If I was his dad, I would've dropped him off at
an orphanage with 20 bucks and a bag of doughnuts.

No, you wouldn't. He was
adorable when he was a baby.

Baby? I'm lking about last week.

I walked into his room. He was
trying to bite his toenails.

Let's be honest. That's monkey behavior.

son inot a monkey.

My point here is, rget the baby.

- You've already got a kid to raise.
- Yeah, I guess.

He's not a monkey.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

I don't wanna watch football.

Nobody cares what you wanna watch.

Why do you get to decide
evything around here?

Oh, I don't know.

Maybe it's because I bought
everything around here.

Oh, right, play the money
card. That's all you got.

That's all I need. Now shut up.

No, you shut up.

All right, I'm gonna count to three
and then I'm gonna kick your ass.

Ooh, I'm scared.

One. Two.

I'm only leaving 'cause I'm bored.

He keeps growing, I'm screwed.

Hey, hey, uh, you wanna hear what
I wrote the night you were born?

Not really.

Oh, come on. Come on. Uh,
sit down. You'll like it.

It's kind of a poem.

"My son, my son, my only one.

You open my heart like the morning sun."

"Your tiny face, your tiny hand.

Never have I felt a love so grand.

Gay.

What do you know about
poetry, you monkey?

Oh, hey, Herb.

Just thought I'd stop by and see if you
needed any help with the baby's room.

Thanks, I'm painting today.

Oh, great. Just call me Vincent
Van "Gogh-ing" to help you.

Funnier in my head. Let's go.

Oh, Judith, look who stopped by
to help paint the baby's room.

Surprise.

Herb doesn't need any help, Alan.

- Yes, I do.
- Yes, he does.

Come on, I'm just finishing up the base coat,
but I'm gonna start on the unicorn stencils.

Unicorns? Oh, Herb, that's
just a pony with a strap-on1

I know, tell me about it.

It's like nine kinds of
"suck" in an eight-suck bag.

- Hey, Jake?
- Gotta go.

I didn't mean to interrupt your call.

Yeah, well, you should've thought
of that before you barged in.

Yeah.

The reason I barged in was to apologize
for threatening to kick your ass.

I wouldn't really do that.

You couldn't really do that.

Anyway, I was thinking about
ordering a pizza. You interested?

No, thanks.

Maybe you didn't hear me. Pizza.

Dough, sauce, cheese, grease,
meat. I've seen you lick the box.

I'm not hungry.

- Okay, what the hell's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

Fine. Be that way.

I know what's going on here.

You're bent out of shape 'cause
your mom's having another baby.

- No, I'm not.
- It's okay. Nothing to be ashamed of.

In fact, I know exactly how you feel.

My mom's second child ruined my life.

That's my dad.

Listen, it wasn't all bad.

When babies grow up a little,
you can have fun with 'em.

You know, pee in their
canteen, teach 'em to stutter.

Of course, the down side is they're so
damaged later on they move into your guest room

with their kid and never leave.

Not that I don't love having you here.

You're a delight.

I'm fine with the baby.

- Really?
- Yeah. I'm actually kinda looking forward to it.

Well, that's a novel approach.

So if it's not the baby, why have
you been such a dillweed lately?

None of your business.

So it's a girl.

Just get out of my room.

- Make me.
- God, you're such a child.

Oh, yeah, it's a girl.

- Hmm, Jolene.
- Yeah.

Jolene Melnick.

Nope, I don't think so.

Why not? You could call her Jo or Josie.

Kinda wanted to name her
after my Grandma Mildred.

- Mildred Melnick?
- Yeah. We could call her Mil, or Millie.

I'm sorry, Herb.

But with a name like Mildred you might
as well call her Staff Sergeant Melnick.

Herb, can you get the cookies for me?

Oh, sure. We, uh, keep 'em on
the top shelf of the pantry.

- You know... Jake.
- Yeah.

Charlie keeps his fudge
nuggets in the trunk of his car.

Thank you, dear.

What are you doing here?

I'm helping my friend, helping you.

If not for me, our little girl would
be surrounded by metaphorical pony peni.

Our little girl?

Alan, I don't know what you
imagine happened between you and me,

but if you say anything to Herb,

I swear to God I'll put a gun in your mouth
and paint these walls with your brains.

I think we settled on mermaids.

Cookie for my cookie?

Oh, yum. Thank you.

Pregnancy's a wild ride, huh?

One minute she's loving and affectionate,
the next minute she's, well...

Cruel, vengeful, castrating?

I was going to say moody.

Wait for it.

Of course I want to go to the party.

'Cause my stupid uncle won't let me.

I don't know, 'cause
he's old and clueless.

No, I can't sneak out.

'Cause I gotta be here to
change his adult diapers.

Otherwise he just sits in his own filth.

I know, it's really gross.

- Hi there.
- Gotta go.

You're not supposed to listen
to my private conversations.

You're not supposed to
tell people I crap my pants.

Okay, whatever.

So what's the deal with this party that
I'm supposedly not letting you go to,

like I actually give a rat's
ass about your social life?

Just leave me alone.

You know that's not going to happen.

Come on. You can trust me.

You told me never trust
a guy who says "trust me."

Did you trust me when I told you that?

I'm confused.

Of course you are. Now tell me why
you don't want to go to this party.

I can't tell you. It's embarrassing.

Okay, okay.

How about I tell you something
embarrassing about myself first?

Like what?

Well, let's see.

All right, about 15 years
ago, I was in Bangkok.

- What?
- Bangkok.

It's a real place, you nimrod.

Still funny though.

Anyway, I was in this bar and
I met this beautiful woman,

and I was a little drunk and I
didn't notice the Adam's apple.

But later that night...

Well, believe me, I
was really embarrassed.

Girls don't have Adam's apples.

Oh, dude, you are such a 'mo.

No, no, no, no, we just kissed.

Oh, that's even worse1

All right. I shared. Now you share.

You didn't have to share that.

A fart in the lunch line
would've made your point.

I get it. I'm sorry. Now talk.

Okay.

Well, there's this girl I kinda like
and she's gonna be at the party tonight.

And she... said she
wants to hook up with me.

And you're nervous.

Well, she's gone out with a ninth
grader and I think she's done stuff.

Okay, I get it.

You've got yourself an experienced
older woman who knows more than you.

Everybody knows more than me.

You should hear some of the
things my friends have done.

Oh, please. How old are your friends?

Same age as me.

- How old are you?
- Fourteen.

Mmm, horrible age.

All right, first of all, whenever 14-year-old
boys talk about sex, they're lying.

But for a guy like you, the
truth can be a powerful tool.

- What?
- Powerful tool.

Stay with me, Jake.

How about a powerful tool in Bangkok?

Jake, what I'm trying to tell you here
is that the truth can work for you.

What truth? That I don't
know what I'm doing?

Yep, play to your strengths,
which in your case is ignorance.

Here, I'll show you.

You gently cup her face in your hands,
look her in the eye and tell her,

"I'm new at this and I'm trusting
you to be patient with me."

You're kidding.

Nope. Girls eat that crap up.

And I'll tell you something else-- that line
will work for you all the way through college.

Or in your case, your
second hitch in the Navy.

Now go get dressed and
I'll take you to that party.

Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

No problem, buddy.

Still didn't need to
hear that Bangkok story.

I'm sorry.

It's going to give me nightmares.

Welcome to the club.

All right, we're agreed
on a Montessori preschool.

But what about child care?

Oh, well, uh, Judith's mother has already
told us we can count on her for baby-sitting.

What?

Oh, nothing, nothing.
Lenore's a lovely woman.

I'm, I'm sure the baby will be fine.

Oh, okay, good.

Yeah. She's probably got
a lid on those dons by now.

What demons?

Oh, ah, well, it's no biggie.

Um, she just, uh, hit a little rough
patch with the prescription pills...

the intervention, the, the rehab.

There was an intervention?

And rehab. Um, three times.

Three times?

Well, so far.

Oh, dear God, what the hell happened?

Golly, I-I didn't want
to be the one to tell you.

Alan, please.

All right, um, Lenore was
baby-sitting one night,

and when Judith and I came home,

we found her face down in a bowl of H agen-Dazs
with a couple of Percocets in her hair.

You're kidding.

Well, that's not the scary part.

Um, we heard some shrieking and, uh,

found baby Jake with his head stuck in a
doggie door trying to fend off a raccoon.

A raccoon?

Yeah. Yeah.We-we got him all
the shots just to be safe,

but he was never the same after that.

Judith never told me about this.

Well, it's her mother,
Herb. What's she gonna say?

But tell you what, sneak up on Jake one night
wearing a Davy Crockett hat and see what happens.

Anyway, if you ever need a-a sitter for
little Jolene, you, uh, you call Uncle Alan.

How's it going in here?

Oh, honey, good news.

Alan's offered to baby-sit so we
don't have to risk calling your mother.

Get out1

A raccoon?

And you believed him?

Are you insane?

How do I look?

- She already likes you, right?
- Yeah.

Then you look great.

Let's go.

Hello?

I'm still not real sure about this.

What's the big deal? I
told you how to handle it.

I know. I just...

I just don't want to go.

All right... All right.

No hurry.

It's not like they're
going to stop makin' girls.

how about we order that
pizza and watch a movie?

Cool. I should probably change
back into my eating shirt.

Don't worry. You can't ruin this shirt.

What the hell is that cologne?

Air freshener from the toilet.

I figured I was spraying it anyway.

14 years later

Oh, hey, Judith. What's up?

Actually, quite a bit.

Is something wrong?

No, uh, it's just, um, I think
it's time you knew the truth.

What truth?

Marlene Melnick is your daughter.

Would you like the last sausage?

- Oh, how about we split it?
- Okay.

Meet you in the middle.

Okay. Sexy.

Nothing says love like
a little morning pork.

You're home early. How was Vegas?

Never again.

Oh, you lost?

No, Alan. I won so much freaking
money that I'm embarrassed to go back.

All right... well, uh,
you remember Melissa?

Of course he remembers me, Alan.

He deflowered me, then dumped me.

No offense, sweetheart, but your flower had
been plucked and potted long before I met you.

Okay, okay, look. Look,
we're all adults here.

This doesn't have to be awkward,
you know. I mean, sure...

Melissa is my receptionist, and sure, she was
with you, and sure, that ended badly, but, uh ...

Okay, I guess this
does have to be awkward.

Honey, shouldn't we be
getting ready for work?

Yes, yes, let's do that.

You want to shower together?

Oh, great, great. Uh, let me
just, uh, start without you.

There's a couple of
things I'd like to prewash.

There's a mental image I didn't need.

Charlie, I need to talk to you.

I'm sorry I was a jerk.

I'm happy for you and Alan, and I will kick myself for
the rest of my life for losing someone as special as you.

No, silly, it's about something else.

Oh, good, 'cause even
I didn't believe that.

Alan's birthday is next Saturday.

Really? I don't think so.

Yeppers. He's gonna be 40.

Wow, that is so weird.

My baby brother's gonna be 40.

- How old are you?
- 39

That's what makes it so weird.

Anyway, I think we should
have a party for him.

Why?

Because it's an important birthday, and he deserves
a big party with all his friends and loved ones.

All right... all right,
let's break this down.

You want him to get what he deserves.

You want it to be with his friends and
loved ones, and you want it to be big.

Pick one.

Come on, Charlie.
Don't be such a pooper.

If it's gonna be a fun
party, I need your help.

You want it to be
fun? Don't invite Alan.

- Charlie...
- Okay.

Okay, you know who would love to
help you out with this? Our mom.

Really?

Oh, yeah. Nothing she likes better
than extending herself for other people.

Good idea. I'll give her a call.

You do that.

Wait till she hears Alan's 40.

DeSto presents:

Two and a Half Men
Season 06 Episode 14

Charlie.

Wake up. I need to talk to you.

Don't move. Don't blink.

Maybe she'll think
you're dead and leave.

I know you can hear me, Charlie.

She's bluffing. Just stay still.

Okay, don't panic.

You've experienced
oxygen deprivation before.

I can't breathe, Mom.

Oh, good, you're awake.

What can I do for you?

I received a very unsettling
message on my answering machine,

and I would like you
to explain it to me.

Okay, look.

Sometimes the liquor makes
me say hateful things.

No, this message was from
some woman named Melissa.

Alan's receptionist.

Really?From the sound of her voice,

I'd guess she earns her living
baking cookies in a hollow tree.

Anyway, she's somehow gotten it into her
head that Alan is turning 40 on Saturday.

Yeah, so?

Is she insane?

Running around telling
people my son is 40?

I know. She's a bad person.

That's not all. She wants
me to help with a party.

Where in God's name could
she have gotten such an idea?

Beats me.

Maybe the fact that you're his
mother confused the poor girl.

Oh, you're up.

You've been cleaning in
there this whole time?

Sure, let's say I was cleaning.

Hey, Uncle Charlie, if you're going out
today, can I pull your car out of the garage?

No, I don't want you pulling
my car out of the garage.

Okay, I won't. From now on.

Hey, what's, uh...
what's going on up here?

Oh, terrific.

This meeting of the worst club in the
history of the world can now come to order.

Madam President, you have the floor.

Oh, I get it. Sorry to interrupt.

Go back to what you were planning...
uh, uh doing, uh, whatever.

Oh, uh, apropos of nothing, uh, I like
red velvet cake and close-up magic.

Oh, crap. Now we have
to throw him a party.

- Who?
- Your father.

- Why?
- It's his birthday.

Can I bring a date?

- You got a date?
- That depends.

- On what?
- Can I borrow your car?

You don't got a date.

You know, we don't have to go out to
dinner just 'cause it's my birthday.

Don't be silly. This
is a very special night.

How many times do you turn 40?

In my family, three or four.

Well, the first time
is the one that counts.

Okay So... so, it's just us, right?

Of course, it's just
us. Who else would it be?

I don't know. My friends, family.

A close-up magician.

Oh, darn, what gave it away?

Well, when I left the house, Jake was taking
a shower, uh, Charlie had on long pants,

and Berta said she had to quit early because
she was going to some loser's birthday party.

Oh, good, I had her down as a "maybe."

Promise you'll act surprised.

Oh, my God, what a surprise!

I don't know these people.

We have a private room.

Sorry.

We got a private room.

Go back to your dinner.

Ooh, gazpacho.

This is so nice.

A private, intimate dinner
for just the two of us.

Oh, my God, you guys!

There's nobody here.

I don't understand it. I told
them to be here an hour ago.

Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

My family are a bunch of
thoughtless, selfish butt-wipes.

Surprise.

Evelyn, smile.

That's a keeper.

Listen, darling, are you going
to be cutting the cake soon?

Because, actually, I have
a real party to go to.

You can't go. We haven't
even done the speeches yet.

Oh, of course.

Were we supposed to write speeches?

For what?

For Alan.

Let him write his own speech.

Uh, can I have your attention, please?

I want to thank you all for coming
to celebrate this wonderful occasion.

I thought it was Alan's birthday.

And now it's time to say a few
words about the guest of honor.

I can think of a few words.

Not only is he a terrific
doctor and fantastic boss,

he is also good and kind
and smart and funny...

and... a really swell kisser.

I can still hear you.

Sorry I'm late. I was burning a fatty
with one of the busboys in the parking lot.

How are you?

Everyone, this is my mother, Shelly.

Mom, this is Alan's
mother, Evelyn, and...

Sweetie, save your breath, because I'm
way too toasted to remember a lot of names.

Ooh, bread.

All right, well, uh,
now that we're all here,

why don't we take turns saying something
about Alan and how much he means to us.

Okay, Jake, you want to start?

No, I got to go make room for cake.

Uh, Berta, why don't
you get the ball rolling?

Sure. What the hell?

Zippy, I got to tell you, when you first
moved in, I didn't really care for you.

You were a persnickety,
self-righteous, smug son of a bitch.

And now here we are, six years later.

Thank you.

Hear, hear.

Oh, okay. Anyone else?

Okay. I'll go.

I have pictures of myself dressed
in a forest ranger uniform,

and I have absolutely no memory
of ever working as a forest ranger.

Thank you.

All righty.

Uh, who's next? Evelyn?

Me? Isn't it enough I carried
him for seven and a half months?

You'd be surprised how many
women opt for the full nine.

Come on, Evelyn, you
have to say something.

Oh, fine.

Alan, darling.

You were always the good son.

Of course, your brother
didn't set the bar very high.

- Hear, hear.
- Wait a minute.

Charlie, do you want to say anything?

Uh, all right.

Alan, you're my little brother.

And I know over the
years I've tormented you.

I've embarrassed you in public.

I've tied you to streetlights, car
bumpers, the occasional angry animal...

Oh, remember that Fourth of July when I used
your ass as a launch pad for my bottle rockets?

Anyway, I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

thanks for the memories.

That's it? That's all you have to say?

I suppose I could talk
about his bed-wetting.

You people are horrible.

No. Honey, it's okay.

No-no-no-no,
it's not okay.

You should be ashamed of yourselves.

This is a warm and wonderful human being and
he deserves more, especially from his family.

I don't even know why you
guys showed up tonight.

Well, I can't speak for anybody
else, but I'm getting overtime.

Come on, Alan. We're leaving.

Really? Before the cake?

You don't need people
who don't appreciate you.

Uh, well, no, but I do kind
of need Charlie's house.

No, you don't. You'll come live
with me and Mom. Right, Mom?

You know, I did spend a summer
in Yosemite doing shrooms,

so maybe I wasn't an
official forest ranger.

Let's go. Mom, we're leaving.

Okay. I'm sorry. This is
the best bread I ever had.

Who likes magic?

I shaved for this?

- Berta?
- Who's asking?

What's wrong?

Too much celebrating last night.

I didn't notice you
drinking at Alan's party.

No, afterward.

With the magician at his place.

You went back to his place?

Well, technically, his van.

Well, why didn't you just stay home?

If I stay home, you don't pay me.

So you just came in to lie on my couch?

Tough times, Charlie.

Some people are living in their vans.

Oh, make it stop!

Hello?

Hi, Mom.

Alan? Nah, he didn't come home.

You're right. We were
funny. He just overreacted.

I'm sure he'll come back
eventually. He always does.

You should've named him "Herpes."

Yeah, I wish I'd thought
of it last night, too.

Talk to you later.

So what are we going to do today?

Aren't you going to ask about your dad?

What about him?

Were we not at the
same party last night?

Did you not notice when you finally came
out of the toilet that your father was gone?

You know, now at you mention it...

Herpes, Jr.

Look who's back.

I'm not back I just
came to get my stuff.

You're really going to
milk this thing, huh?

I'm not milking anything,
Chlie. There is no milk.

I'm moving in with
Melissa and her mother.

Sounds like milk to me.

I need to be someplace where I'm appreciated,
someplace where I'm nurtured and loved.

You're not taking me seriously, are you?

Oh, come on, Alan.

You ain't going anywhere.

You know it. I know it.

The seagulls out there
crapping on my deck know it.

You think he'll be back?

Oh, yeah.

No, no. This is it.

This is where I cut the cord!

Oh, man.

I think David Copperfield
slipped me a roofie.

I really appreciate you
taking me in like this.

Yeah, we love you,
Alan. We want you here.

You're a good man, and
you have a beautiful soul.

It is beautiful, isn't it?

God forbid my family should notice.

- Oh, damn, I knew I'd forget something!
- What'd you forget?

My son.

Well, that's no problem.

We'll just move Mom's hydroponic equipment
out of the garage and make a bedroom for him.

Hydroponic equipment?

I'm a bit of a horticulturist.

A little herb garden.

Ah, okay. Well, uh, uh, just a
heads-up, I love my son and everything,

but he hasn't quite gotten
to "beautiful soul" yet.

He's more "methane cloud."

He's still one of God's flowers.

All he needs is a little love,
ultraviolet light, potassium

and he'll grow into
some righteous chronic.

Quitting time.

What are you doing here?

I'm watching TV.

- Why didn't you go with your dad?
- Dad was here?

Yeah, he came by to get his stuff
and I figured that included you.

I'm not stuff, Uncle
Charlie. I'm a human being.

Don't flatter yourself.

And turn off the TV. I'm
taking you back to your mom's.

Mom and Herb are in Mexico.

For how long?

I don't know.

Turn off the TV. I'm
taking you to Mexico.

Can I drive?

You all comfy, cozy?

Mom made you some hot chocolate.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, and it's got those little
marshmallows. I love those.

Good. I'm going to the market.
What would you like for dinner?

Oh, gosh, I don't
know. What do you want?

I want to please you.

Really?

No one's ever said that to me before.

Get used to it.

I'll try.

Now, what can I get you?

Um, well...

you know the macaroni that's
shaped like the little wagon wheels?

I do.

I like that with melted cheese.

You got it.

Oh, and maybe a couple of
those bottled wine spritzers?

Okeydoke.

I'm getting mac and spritzers
I'm getting mac anspritzers.

Here you go, bright eyes. I
made you some banana bread.

Aw, really? Banana bread? Oh, thank you.

Wow, it's still warm.

Mmm, right out of the oven.

Oh, that's, uh, that's very unusual.

Uh, I'm tasting bananas and,
uh, what is that, nutmeg?

Nope.

Mmm, that's good.

You know what? You might want
to just start with half a piece.

I can't believe it.

Believe what?

I think I miss him.

Miss who?

Your father.

What about you?

What about me what?

- Do you miss him?
- Who?

- Your father.
- Why? Where is he?

Honey, they didn't have any spritzers,
so I got you 7Up and sangria.

Alan?

Oh, hey, baby. Have you
tried your mom's banana bread?

I'm back.

I'm shocked.

- Hey, Alan.
- Yeah?

- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

- I told you he would be back.
- Who?

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, man.

That was intense.

I need some fluid.

It must been down a quarter.

Just make sure you are up a quarter.

Hey, you know what will be good right now?

Pudding cup

I've made some in the fridge, you want one?

You have bad experience in pudding?

What are we doing, Charlie?

Well, you are crying, and my best guesses  is

i am about to apologize for something.

Everytime i came over is same routine

We have chinese takeout, then we have sex,

then we roll over, and go to sleep.

Which is why i suggest to the pudding.

You know, fix up a little.

Besides, what about the wonderful talking,

and joking and, you know, sharing we do?

Sharing?

What do we share, Charlie?

Well, uh, we share Chinese takeout.

And, uh... hey, the other night,

we watched the Laker game together.

You watched it over my shoulder while we were having sex.

Oh, come on. It was overtime.

What kind of relationship is this?

We don't go anywhere. We don't do anything.

Where do you want to go?

What do you want to do?

I can get Laker tickets.

I don't want to go to a basketball game!

I want to know who you are.

I want you to know who I am.

I know who you are.

You do?

Okay, what's my middle name?

Your middle name.

Okay.

I know this.

Sunburned boobs...

What?

Hang on. Hang on.

Sunburned boobs...

red boobs, red breasts.

Robin.

Little memory trick.

My middle name is Christine.

Not a very good trick.

Who's my best friend?

Where do I work?

What's my cat's name?

What's my favorite movie?

What kind of music do I like?

What religion was I raised in?

And do I have any brothers and sisters?

Okay, I'd like to start with the cat.

I'm gonna go with...

Fluffy.

Drop dead.

Snowball?

Mr. Mittens?

Tiger?

Whiskers, Puss-Puss?

Oh, come on.

What's my middle name?

Francis.

No, it's not.

Yes, it is!

Show-off.

<b>Two and a half men
Season 06 - Episode 15
"I'd Like to Start With the Cat"</b>

Oh, Chelsea, come on.

How much do I need to know about you

other than I'm crazy about you?

It's not that you don't know.

It's that you don't care.

I do care.

I just don't pay close attention.

Good-bye, Charlie.

I mean, I pay attention, but I don't test well.

Damn.

What did you do, bring out the handcuffs too early?

Apparently, I don't know her middle name.

It's Christine.

-How do you know?
-She told me.

-Why did she tell you?
-I asked her.

-Why did you ask?
-How else do you get to know a person?

Go away.

If a woman stormed out on me after sex,

would you go away?

That's beside the point.

So, what happened?

I don't know.

We were having a nice night.

Little lo mein, little sex.

Then the crying started.

Oh, yeah.

Been there, done that.

No, she was crying.

She wants more out of our relationship.

-More what?
-I'm not sure.

I know it's not pudding.

Well, what did she say?

She said I don't know her well enough.

You tell me: what's more important to know?

Her cat's name or which of her body parts you can't sneak up on?

Well, I'm not sure one necessarily precludes the other.

Yeah, well, I've never been mule-kicked

for not knowing a cat's name.

It doesn't matter.

There's more where she came from.

Speaking of which...

where does she come from?

I don't know, and I don't care.

Davenport, Iowa.

Bite me.

-Want to know her cat's name?
-No.

It's Mandu.

Mandu?

Yeah, you know, Cat Mandu.

It's cute, huh?

Why was I thinking Puss-Puss?

Because that's what you're always thinking.

What happened to all the pudding cups?

I guess your uncle ate them.

All of them?

There were two 12-packs.

Have something else.

No cookies?

What the hell is going on around here?

Hey, watch your mouth.

I am watching it.

It's empty. I need dessert.

Son of a bitch.

Jake!

Frozen peas?

What am I gonna do with frozen peas?

Well, if you want dessert, have an apple.

It's not funny, dad

You sure I can't interest you in a pudding cup?

Thanks.

I'm okay.

How about a chocolate chunk cookie?

No, thank you.

Did you quit drinking?

God, no.

Why?

You seem to be experimenting

with a new sugar delivery system.

Anything bothering you lately?

Well, there is this one thing,

but I don't know if it's medical or psychological.

Tell me.

Lately, I've passed up

a couple of opportunities to get some strange.

Strange?

women with whom I have not previously been acquainted.

Oh, right, strange.

Charming.

Go on.

Anyway, I was wondering if there's something wrong with me.

Because you passed up meaningless sex with strangers?

Exactly.

That's not like me.

Hey, you know, I bet "strange" comes from "stranger."

I wouldn't be surprised.

So, what else is going on with your life?

Not much.

I've been gaining a little weight for some reason.

Maybe 'cause I haven't been sleeping well.

Yeah, that's probably it.

Oh, and this one girl I've been seeing pretty regularly

decided to dump me.

Huh.

"Huh," what?

Oh, nothing, it's just...

sometimes I feel like I'm stealing your money.

So, tell me about this woman.

Chelsea?

Not much to tell.

She's beautiful, sexy, smart, independent.

Sometimes when she laughs,

she makes a little snorting noise.

It's really cute.

Kind of like...

Not as cute when I do it.

Sounds like quite a catch.

She's okay.

Why did she dump you?

Who can understand a woman's mind?

Yeah, we're pretty little puzzles, ain't we?

So, it's not just me.

Anyway, for some reason,

she suddenly became dissatisfied with our relationship.

Well, describe the relationship.

It was great.

She'd come over a couple times a week.

Either she'd bring food or I'd have something delivered.

We'd have sex, then eat.

Then, maybe have sex again, depending on what was on TV.

And she became dissatisfied with that?

I know, right?

Butterscotch.

So, how did you feel about losing her?

What do you mean? What do I mean?

Come on, Charlie.

Dr. Seuss could diagnose this.

You're stuffing yourself with crap

to suppress your negative feelings.

No, I'm pretty sure that's why I drink.

You have a choice here.

You can dig down and confront your feelings

so they won't be controlling your behavior,

or you can keep eating pudding and cookies

until you have more chins than a Chinese phone book.

No, what else you got?

Do you have a better idea?

What if I could get Chelsea back?

That would only be a temporary solution.

So?

That's what people said about bourbon,

and we've been together for almost 30 years.

Okay, you're right.

Go get Chelsea back, and all your problems will be solved.

I'm sensing sarcasm.

Oh, good, we're finally making progress.

Here you go.

What are you drinking?

Chocolate caramel frappuccino

with whipped cream and sprinkles.

My nephew turned me on to it.

You want some?

No, thanks, I had a hot fudge sundae for breakfast.

Ooh, that sounds good.

You look nice.

I've got to get back to work, Charlie.

What do you want?

I just wanted to see you.

See how you're doing.

I'm fine.

Good.

And how's your family back in...

Davenport, Iowa?

I'm from Champaign, Illinois.

You sure?

I'm sure.

Bastard set me up.

What?

Nothing, nothing.

I miss you.

I miss you, too, but it doesn't matter.

Our relationship wasn't going anywhere,

and you are incapable of change.

It's not that I'm incapable.

I've just been unwilling.

Thanks for clearing that up.

No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

I've been seeing a shrink.

Really?

Yeah, and I'm making a lot of progress

confronting my-- what do you call them?-- personal issues.

Well, I'm glad to hear it.

Come.

Sit.

And check this out: the shrink's a woman.

A real ballbuster.

I can't get away with anything.

Ballbuster?

In a good way.

You know, a buster of emotional balls.

You should meet her.

Are you suggesting we go to couples counseling?

Sure.

I mean, I want to work on our relationship,

and what better way than couples counseling?

You're serious.

Well, of course I'm serious.

What, you think I'd blurt out something like that

in the spur of the moment in a desperate attempt

to keep you from leaving?

It occurred to me.

Well, clearly, you don't know me as well as you should.

All right.

Couples counseling.

Wow, I'm impressed, Charlie.

Me, too.

Okay, I got to run.

Let me know when our appointment is.

Sure thing.

Bye-bye.

Oh, God, what have I done?

Davenport, Iowa?

Uh, did I say Davenport, Iowa?

I meant Champaign, Illinois.

Okay.

That's one for you.

Thank you.

And that's one for me.

Now, I need some advice.

Oh, and just a friendly heads-up.

You screw with me again, it's gonna cost you some teeth.

I'm listening.

Wait a minute.

What's this about?

Oh, he bought some stuff with his own money,

and he doesn't want you eating it.

You've been to couples counseling, right?

Yeah, why?

I'm going with Chelsea,

and I need to know what I'm getting into.

Oh, you're gonna love it.

I am?

Absolutely.

Once a week, you sit on a couch with your significant other

while she snips off your testicles,

reaches up inside your chest cavity

and goes like this...

to your heart.

That doesn't sound very good.

Oh, it's horrible.

But it's worth it

because you're paying a stranger to watch

while your life goes down the toilet.

Along with your money and your house and your car

and every last shred of your self-respect!

You know, maybe you're not the right guy to ask.

Oh, no.

No, no, no, I'm the perfect guy to ask.

When Judith and I started,

we were just a couple with a few problems.

When we finished, I came to live on your couch!

God bless couples counseling!

That better not be one of my pudding cups.

Nope.

Hi, Charlie.

Come on in.

Shouldn't we wait for Chelsea?

She's already here.

Really?

That seems a little ambushy.

Hi, sweetie.

You're late.

I know. I know.

I'm sorry.

But...

I have a good excuse.

Happy first day of counseling.

You brought a present?

Yeah.

Isn't that the protocol?

No.

So...

you don't want this bottle of champagne?

Bastard got me again.

Well, why don't we get started.

Hold on. Hold on.

Does the name "Mandu" ring any kind of a bell?

What?

I'm gonna kill him.

Well, why don't we start out with why we're here

and what our goals are.

Chelsea, would you like to go first?

Sure.

I want to know if my relationship

with Charlie can be more than...

sex, TV, and Chinese food.

It can.

Right, Doc?

Of course it can.

Ð»Ð»°¡
Thank you.

Well, this is good.

This is progress.

I have to say this has been a very good session.

Where do you think you're going?

Nowhere.

Just...

stretching my legs.

Charlie, before you got here, Chelsea mentioned

that she feels you've fallen into a rut.

A rut?

We're not in a rut.

When's the last time we did something new?

Hello?

Great... and what else?

He's got nothing.

Excuse me, but if this is gonna work,

you can't jump all over me while I'm thinking.

I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Thank you.

I got nothing.

Okay, might I make a suggestion?

Would you be willing to commit to Chelsea

that maybe once a week, twice a month,

you do something together

completely outside your comfort zone?

Done. No problem.

So, we could go to the ballet,

the opera, visit my parents,

hang out with my brother,

go hiking with my friends?

I was thinking more like renting a chick flick

and ordering Italian.

This is hopeless.

No, no, no, no, there's hope.

There's always hope.

Keep hope alive.

I can do those things.

Come.

Sit.

Charlie, has it ever occurred to you

that you might enjoy doing new things

and meeting new people?

I know I'm supposed to say yes, but...

every fiber of my body is screaming, "No!"

All right, then I have to ask.

Given that you and Chelsea are such different people,

why do you want to be in this relationship?

Well...

'Cause I'm crazy about her.

'Cause, when I'm with somebody else,

I'm thinking of her.

Not that I've been with anybody else.

Tell her, Doc.

He passed up strange.

See, that's got to mean something,

considering how I used to, you know, live for strange.

First time in the sack,

she was the strange.

Charlie, can I give you my opinion as your therapist?

Sure. Shut up.

Oh, God, I wish I could.

Chelsea, look.

I know I'm not perfect.

Hey, hey, hey.

I'm sorry.

That was probably unprofessional.

Anyway,

you need to know

that you mean everything to me,

and I'll do whatever it takes make this work.

You really mean that?

I do.

Thank you, Charlie.

Well, this has been very helpful.

Sit down, Charlie. Sit down, Charlie.

We're not done?

Not even close.

Oh, boy.

What else could we possibly have to talk about?

Well, there's always your mother

and the fact that your relationship issues

are linked to your anger towards her,

as well as fear of your latent homosexuality.

It was kind of a rhetorical question.

Charlie?

Yeah.

How was couples counseling?

You really want to know?

Sure.

Tell me everything.

Why?

Why would you do that?

You know, I've been asking myself the same thing,

and the only thing I can come up with is:

it's really, really funny.

Go ahead.

Yuk it up.

Those were among the worst

50 minutes of my entire life.

I told you.

Didn't I tell you?

Yep.

You told me.

I bet you left with your gonads in a guppy bag.

I didn't get a bag.

Going back next week?

Uh-huh.

$180 an hour?

$240

Licensed.

You two kids will patch things up in no time.

Hey, just because counseling didn't help your relationships

doesn't mean it won't help mine.

Right, right.

Keep drinking that old Kool-Aid.

Looking for something?

Don't screw with me, kid.

Now, hand over the pudding or you'll be sorry.

Have an apple.

Little turd called my bluff.

.......... ********** ..........

It seems to me that it would be more fair if
everybody on both basketball teams was the same height.

That's how it seems to you, huh?

Yeah, like in boxing.

Heavyweights fight heavyweights.

Lightweights fight lightweights.

So, in your world, everybody on a
basketball team would be, say, 6'5*,

and they'd only play
other teams that were 6'5*.

Exactly. That way, no one
would have an unfair advantage.

That's very interesting.

You really think so?

No, but it's less likely to start a fight than
** That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. **

And yet, you said it anyway.

Listen, I've got to talk
to you about something.

Okay, dumb was a poor choice of words.

It's not about that.

Can it wait till halftime?

No.

I've got to go to a
funeral this weekend.

Oh, man, I'm sorry. Who died?

My
ex-mother-in-law.

That couldn't wait till halftime?

Charlie.

I'm just saying she'll
still be dead at halftime.

I was very close to her and I want to pay
my respects, so I'm going to Santa Barbara,

and I'll be spending the
weekend with my ex-husband.

Oh, okay.

Define with.

Well, everyone's staying
at his parents' house.

All right... well, do you
want me to come with you?

- No.
- Great.

- Why not?
- Do you want to come?

Hell, no.

That's what I figured.

Look, I just want to
be up-front with you.

I was married to Alex for eight years, and
I just don't want you to get the wrong idea.

I wouldn't have had any idea if
you hadn't felt the need to tell me.

Yeah, well, I don't want us to
have any secrets from each other.

Oh, I agree. We definitely
should not have secrets.

- Right.
- You know, from this point forward.

What kind of guy is this Alex?

He's a good guy. We just got married
too young and wanted different things.

He wanted something
different than your things?

'Cause your things are terrific.

Thank you.

He didn't go gay on you, did he?

- No.
- Rats.

- Are you jealous?
- No, no. Of course not.

I mean, maybe a little. You know,
in the sense that his mother's dead.

<b>Two and a Half men
Season 06 - Episode 16
** She'll Still Be Dead At Halftime **</b>

I miss you, too, honey.
How was the funeral?

Yeah, I guess they're all pretty sad.

Probably why they don't
call them fun-erals.

Yeah, that was lame.

So, where are you now, at the house?

And where is your ex-husband?

And where is his room
in relationship to yours?

Hey, hey, it's got nothing
to do with jealousy.

I just know, based on a
lifetime of experience,

that penises do not observe
a traditional mourning period.

Forget it, you are not driving my
car until you get a learner's permit.

- Not even in the driveway?
- Not anywhere.

What if you have a heart attack?
Can I drive you to the hospital?

- No, call an ambulance.
- Fine.

If they don't get here in
time, can I have your car?

There's my posse. What
are we doing tonight, boys?

Think big. It's my treat.

- Drunk?
- Probably.

Where is Chelsea?

She had to go out of town.

Oh, so your girlfriend's
gone for a couple of days.

- Now, suddenly, you have time for us?
- Yeah.

You ever think that maybe
Jake and I already have plans?

That our lives go on even
when you're not around?

That we don't just pop into
existence the moment you need us?

I'm free.

Me, too. I'm just making a point.

So, what's it going to be? A movie,
bowling? Putt-putt, Nevada cathouse?

I vote for cathouse.

Do you even know what a cathouse is?

Not firsthand. That's
why I voted for it.

A movie would be fine.

All right, a movie it is.
What's out that's good?

There's a new pirate
movie. It's rated Arr!

You guys have no sense of humor.

Can we go to that new theater with the
reserved seats and the jumbo kosher hot dogs?

You just finished dinner.

That doesn't mean I finished eating.

Hey, Charlie.

Wanda... what are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood,
and I'm drunk and horny.

New plan.

Have I met this one before?

I doubt it.

She looks familiar.

Blond, bustyand bombed?

Around here, that's familiar.

I thought Uncle Charlie liked Chelsea.

He does.

Well, then, what's he doing with Wanda?

Well, buddy, it's like this.

Uh, despite his many admirable qualities,
your Uncle Charlie is, at heart, a sleazeball.

That's what I figured. I
just wanted a second opinion.

Hang on. I'll grab another bottle.

Broad is part camel.

Except the humps aren't on her back.

Oh, come on. That was
funnier than Rated arr!

Look, I know you're upset, but I'll
take you to the movies some other time.

This has nothing to do with the movie.

Then what's the problem?

The problem is you're a sleazeball.

Really? How so?

Oh, please. You're in a committed
relationship with a wonderful woman,

and the minute her back is
turned, you're out gallivanting.

- Gallivanting?
- Screwing around.

Then, why don't you just
say, Screwing around?

Hey, as we speak, Chelsea is
doing the same thing I'm doing.

Oh, really?

She's pouring liquor down the
throat of an inebriated party girl?

- Inebriated?
- Drunk.

Geez, who are you showing off for?

At this moment, Chelsea is in
the same house as her ex-husband.

- Why?
- His mother died.

Oh, my apologies. Clearly, anything
you do at this point is justified.

- No, it's not.
- I was being disingenuous.

- What?
- Sarcastic.

You know, this is why Mom
gets pissed off at you so much.

Look. Charlie, do what you want.

If you can live with
yourself, more power to you.

If I could live with myself, we'd be
having this conversation by telephone.

See, him I understand.

Charlie, bed, now, come.

Succinct, ain't she?

Does succinct mean
what I think it means?

I highly doubt it.

Hello?

Right here, baby.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

Never mind. Come on. Come on.

- Let's get you into bed.
- Thank you.

Hey, you remember when we were in Vegas and
I talked that cute waitress into joining us?

Yeah, I do.

I saw her last week at the Hard Rock.

- No kidding.
- She gained a lot of weight.

- Is that so?
- Yeah, we were lucky.

We nailed her right
before she quit smoking.

Listen, Wanda, uh...

She does smell better, though.

- I'm sure, but listen...
- Like Fritos.

You know what? I got
to... check on something.

Well, is it okay if I start without you?

Top drawer, nightstand--
take your pick.

Careful. The big one's a flashlight.

That was fast. I'm guesng.

You're right. I'm a sleazeball.

Don't tell me you actually
had a moral epiphany.

- Uh, epiphany means...
- Don't bother.

I don't know what you call it, but I've
got a gorgeous, willing girl in my bed,

and I'm just not interested.

Maybe you're a gay sleazeball.

I'll tell you what's going on.

You care about Chelsea too much to cheapen your
relationship with a meaningless one-night stand.

You're right. I do care about
Chelsea. I'm crazy about her.

Boy, that sucks.

Hello. Oh, hey, Chelsea, we were just...

Give me that.

Hey, baby, what's going on?

He did? At his own mother's funeral?

Her ex-husband put the moves on her.

What a sleazeball.

No, no, no, don't blame yourself.
You were right to go to the funeral.

Tonight?

I'd love to see you tonight, but...

isn't it a little late to drive
all the way from Santa Barbara?

Oh, you're already on the road.

Oh, that close?

Wonderful. Drive safe.

Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

Remember when I was little and every time someone
said crap, ey had to put a dollar in the swear jar?

I do.

Whatever happened to all that money?

Wanda, I don't want you to take this the wrong
way, but you got to get the hell out of here.

Come on. Chop-chop.

Wanda?

Wanda...

Oh, darn.

So the car's a time machine?

Yeah, it's called a DeLorean.
They don't make 'em anymore.

Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. Help.

- I need help. - Oh, my God,
w-what happened? What's wrong?

Wanda passed out and
Chelsea's on her way over.

Interesting story about the DeLorean.

- It was built by a man named John DeLorean.
- Are you not listening to me? I've got an emergency here.

A dead girl in your bed is an emergency.

A passed-out girl is a dinner date.

I still don't understand why
it's called Back to the Future.

Because they're stuck in the
past, and they have to get back...

Home.

Oh, for God's sake, come on!

My girlfriend's on her way over, and
I've got a half-naked broad upstairs!

Half-naked. I'm your man.

Sit down.

Have you tried waking her up?

Well, of course I've tried waking her
up. This is not my first unk bimbo!

So, what do you expect us to do?

I expect you to help me get
her dressed and drive her home.

Enough talk. Let's get to it.

I said, sit down.

Where does she live?

I have no idea.

So, how am I supposed to drive her home?

Oh, come on. Do I have to think
of everything? Just help me!

All right.

Oh, and I'm a sleazeball?

You're-You're
misreading my-my wow.

I meant Wow, what a predicament.

Yeah, right. You hold her
up. I'll put her dress on.

Okay. She's very fit.

- Hold her arms up.
- Really soft skin.

Smells nice, too.

Okay, why don't you just put a
chloroform-soaked handkerchief over her face

and throw her in the
back of your panel van?

Sounds like a waste of
chloroform, doesn it?

Okay, you get her
head; I'll get her feet.

Why do you get her feet?

- What difference does it make?
- I like feet.

Just get her head.

Okay, on three. One, two, three.

Goodness.

Slowly, slowly.

Slowly, my ass. Come on.

- Let's get her out of here.
- Charlie. Charlie...

Goodness gracious, these are real.

Slowly. Slowly.

Quickly. Quickly.

Hi, baby. Come on in.

Oh, Charlie, you were
so right about Alex.

Alex?

Oh, yeah. Alex. What a sleazeball.

Can I get you something to drink?

No. I just want to get
in bed and hold you.

Oh, boy, does that sound good.

- Leme just say good night to Jake.
- Okay. I'll meet you upstai.

You know what? Why don't
you come say good night, too?

Why?

Well, you're my girlfriend,
and he's my nephew, and...

isn't that enough?

Hey, Jake...

Might want to hang back a sec.
I just ripped off an air biscuit.

- What?
- I farted.

Sorry. I get the fancy
words from my dad.

Anyway, Chelsea and I just
wanted to say good night.

Okay.

He keeps his feelings bottled up.

Everything else he shoots
into the atmosphere.

- Hi, Chelsea.
- Hi, Alan.

Uh, sorry to hear about
your ex-mother-in-law.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, hey, Jake. I could
really use your help.

- With what?
- I'm taking out the...

I'm taking out the trash.

What are you talking about?

The trash.

I'm taking it out, and I could
use your help carrying it.

So now you want my help?

Yes, now I want your help.

What about the 20 bucks you owe me?

Charlie?

Here.

Is the trash still out
where you can see it?

Never mind. Just go help your father.

Fine.

- Nice seeing you, Chelsea.
- Good night.

I could have said 50, couldn't I?

Could have said a hundred.

Can we please go to bed now?

- Beds are for amateurs.
- Oh, Charlie.

What if Jake comes back?

We'll breathe through our mouths.

She really does look familiar.

Terrific.Just don't drop he

I can't wait to tell
my friends about this.

You're not telling anybody about this.

What's the point of doing
it if I can't tell anybody?

You've got 20 bucks and
a memory. Now shut up.

Okay, we've got to get her in the car.

You want me to pull it around?

No, I don't want you to pull it around!

Okay, well, then, you pull it
around, I'll stay here with her.

But be very careful.

Come on, let's finish this upstairs.

Move, move, move!

- Chelsea, wait.
- What?

I'm so happy you're back.

Oh, hey, Alan. Is the trash out?

Uh, almost.

Almost ain't gonna cut it.

Did you at least clean out my room?

- Yes, I did.
- Good. Good.

Okay, well, good night.

Uh, Charlie, can I
talk to you for a sec?

- About what?
- uh, recycling.

I'm not quite sure what
to do with the... big jugs.

Honey, why don't you go up and get
comfortable, and I'll be right there?

- Hurry.
- I will.

Okay, first you need to separate
the plastic from the glass.

Then when you get to the newspaper...
What the hell is your problem?

Shs in Jake's room.
What am I supposed to do?

I don't know.

Here's my credit card. Take
her to a hol or something.

Okay. Chain motel or someplace nicer?

What?

You know, uh, room service, ocean view.

That way when she regains
consciousness, she won't feel so cheap.

Plus, in the nicer places, you
have a free continental breakfast.

Assorted pastries, coffee,
freshly squeezed orange juice...

I know what a continental breakfast is!

- Just get her the hell out of here!
- Okay, fine.

- Oh, Charlie?
- What?

I'm a little low on gas.

- Use the card!
- Right, right, right.

- Charlie?
- What?

I'm really happy you're trying
to make it work with Chelsea.

Go!

What the hell are you doing?

You said I could have
a memory. This is it.

Give me the phone.

Oh, good idea. I can't
get us both in the frame.

Can you make it look like
we're talking to each other?

Forget the picture. We have
to bring the car around.

Shouldn't someone stay here with Wanda?

Yeah, but it shouldn't be you.

- Give me the keys.
- You said I could pull it around.

I changed my mind.

Okay. I'll tell Mom about Wanda.

One ding, one scratch, and you're dead.

Dude, mellow out. You'll
give yourself a heart attack.

Hey, look! It's me!

I'm glad you came back.

I don't like it when you're gone.

I don't like it when I'm gone, either.

Here they are.

Funny story.

I know you hate it when I review the game
tapes, but that was one for the highlight reel.

The highlight reel?

Yeah, you know, "best of"
moments for deathbed reflections.

Only in your memory, right?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I got rid of the
camcorder like I promised.

Good.

It's a shame. The
camera really loves you.

Shut up, Charlie.

I'm not just saying that.

Even from unflattering angles,
you light up the screen.

Oh, I hate you.

That's too bad, 'cause I love you.

Really?

actually, yes.

Yes, I do. love you, Chelsea.

Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you.

No, no, thank you.

Half Men Season06 Episode17</font>

Morning.

Always got to make a comment, don't you?

Oh, my.

Fitful night's sleep on Alcohol Island?

Keept up, funny man.

You're going to be homeless, wearing a tube top
and turning tricks on Santa Monica Boulevard.

What crawled in your
keister and built a nest?

You want to know? You
really want to know?

I've fallen in love with Chelsea.

Well, why are you so upset?
Love is a beautiful thing.

Beautiful thing, my ass.

And we're back in your keister.

Last night, in bed, I
told her I loved her.

And you know what she said?

"I'm still not going
to let you do that"?

She said, "Thank you."

Ooh, that's an ice cube to the man sack.

I don't get it.

I've gonthe whole nine
yards for this relationship.

I gave her her own drawer in my bedroom.

I stopped smoking cigars after sex.

I even started seeing a shrink
so I can be more sensitive,

and I still can't get
a freaking "I love you."

But you've obviously
become more sensitive.

For what I've spent on therapy, I could
get a couple of very expensive hookers

who will say anything I want.

There's that sensitivity
again. Look at the bright side.

What's the bright side?

Well, when women do
tell you they love you,

it usually ends with them tossing a lit
road flare through your bedroom window.

That happened one time.

Why can't you just be
grateful for what you've got?

What do I got?

Oh, a woman who may not
proclaim her love for you,

but who doesn't y to set you
on fire while you're sleeping.

One time.

Okay. A woman who may not
proclaim her love for you,

but who doesn't steal your Mercedes
while you're passed out in the backseat

and drive it into the Pacific Ocean.

Another isolated incident.

I believe I've made my point.

I'm sorry, Alan.

But not being drowned or burned by
the woman I love is not enough for me.

I want more.

Oh, sure. Reach for the stars.

Hey, Charlie, how's it going?

Boy, you really blew it this time.

Did I now? How so?

I've fallen in love with Chelsea.

Ooh, my bad.

Damn right, your bad.

There were plenty of medications that
would've turned me into a happy little potato,

but would you prescribe them? No!

You said I had to get in touch with my feelings
and express them to the people I care about.

Sorry, I must've been drunk.

No. No, it's too late for excuses.

I'm sensing something
happened with Chelsea.

Oh, you're good. There's no
sliding anything past you.

Hey, last night I dreamt I was a giant hot dog
jumping through a doughnut that looked like my mother.

What do you suppose that means?

All right, Charlie,
you've made your point.

Now, tell me what happened.

We can go back to the
doughnut dream later.

It wasn't a real dream.
I was being sarcastic.

Oh, I know, but thfact that you chose that
particular imagery is a little troubling.

Now, what happened wi Chelsea?

I told her I loved her,
and you know what she said?

This process isn't really
about me guessing, Charlie.

She said, "Thank you."

Interesting. How did that make you feel?

No, no, no, no, no! No more
feelings. We tried it your way.

Now, just take out your little
prescription pad and start scribbling.

You don't need medication, Charlie.

You're actually making
tremendous progress.

Are you not listening to a thing I say?

I drift in and out.

Look, the fact that you're upset about this
tells me you've come a long way from the guy

who first walked into this office.

The guy who first walk into
this office was a happy-go-lucky,

fully-functioning man
whore and I want him back.

I'm guessing you don't mean that.

Oh, now you're guessing?

A minute ago it was, "That's
not how the process works."

A minute ago, it didn't.

So are you still seeing Chelsea?

Well, of course I'm still seeing her, but
now the relationship's totally screwed.

Why is that?

She knows I love her.

The whole balance of power
is completely out of whack.

Okay, I really don't like it
when you give me the "huh."

Now,ou're just screwing with me, right?

There's no sliding anything past you.

So let's talk about this whole
balance of power issue of yours.

What about it?

Why do you look at relationships
as a power struggle?

'Cause that's what they are.

Is that how you saw your parents'
relationship, as a power struggle?

Oh, there was no struggle.

My father sat very quietly while my
mother sucked the life out of him.

I see, and you're terrified
of that happening to you.

No, I'm looking forward to it.

In fact, I'm thinking about having a nozzle attached
to my heart to make the sucking more convenient.

Let me ask you something.

What would it take for you feel that
things were back in balance with Chelsea?

Simple. She has to tell me she loves me.

Even if she doesn't feel it?

It's even better if she doesn't feel it.

'Cause that means she's only saying
it 'cause she's afraid to lose me.

Wow.
- Wow?

What's "wow"?

Kind of like "huh," but
with a "wuh" and an "ow."

Charlie, I would suggest that you forget
about getting the "I love you" back

and focus more on what it feels like to give
love, maybe for the first time in your life.

You know, I can get
the drugs without you.

I've got a nephew in junior high.

Do what you got to do.

Now, let's get back to that
mom-shaped doughnut of yours.

So you really told her you loved her?
- Yeah.

Were you loaded?

No.

Were you trying to get
her to do something kinky?

No.

Did she catch you doing
something kinky to somebody else?

No.
- By yourself?

No.

Then I don't get it.
What was your angle?

My angle was I love her.

Why does everybody go
"huh"? What's with the "huh"?

We always knew this day would come.

What day?

The day you stopped
manipulating and conning women.

The day you dropped your guard and
let an honest emotion into your heart.

Well, that's a good day, right?

If you don't mind being
some broad's prison bitch.

What are you going to do now?

I don't know.

I can't keep seeing her, 'cause the
relationship's completely out of balance,

and I can't stop seeing
her because I love her.

I feel for you.

I once loved a guy, didn't love me back.

What did you do?
- 90 days in County.

Plus anger management classes, which by
the way, are a total freaking waste of time.

Have you ever been in love?

Hey, Alan.

Ocupado!

I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!

I know how to restore the
balance of power with Chelsea.

Excuse me! What part of
"ocupado" don't you understand?

The "ocu" or the "pado"?

I understood it all. I was
just hoping you were shaving.

Well, I'm not!

And as you well know, this is an uphill battle
for me, even in the best of circumstances.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is imrtant.

I'm going to get an "I
love you" from Chelsea.

If you let me finish,
you'll get one fm me.

Check this out.

Oh, Charlie, this is so sudden.

If you wait a few minutes,
I'll have a gift for you.

I'm going to marry Chelsea.

Are you serious?

Serious enough to ignore what's
going on right in front of me.

Well, congratulations... I guess.

Thank you.

Let's see her not say "I love you" now.

Let's see what marriage
does to his bowels.

How's your salmon?
- Delicious.

And this is such a romantic restaurant.

I'm glad you like it.

Haveou been here before?

No.

Yes.

Well, a couple times.

A lot.

I know you've dated other
women. Why would you lie?

Survival instinct. Same reason I
don't drink in the bathtub anymore.

What else have you lied to me about?

I don't know. What else
haven't you believed?

You're awful.

Awful good, right?
- Yeah.

Excuse me, I have to powder my nose.

Okay, who's lying now?

Bobby.

Is everything all right, Mr. Harper?

Yeah, terrific.

Listen, my date's in the ladies' room
and I need you to do something for me.

Not a problem.

I'll have the valet bring
your car around to the alley.

I'll open the men's restroom
window so you can shimmy out.

And I'll have a cab standing by to take the lady
home along with the customary chocolate souffl\ to go.

No, no, no, I'm not
breaking up with her.

I'm going to ask her to marry me.

I think we need to
get some coffee in you.

I'm not drunk. I know
exactly what I'm doing.

As always.

All I need you to do is bring a bottle of
champagne, pour a glass for her and a glass for me,

then distract her so I can
slip the ring into her glass.

Oh, how charmingly original.

You've seen that before?
- Never.

Here she comes. Go get the champagne.

I'll keep the bathroom
window open just in case.

Charlie, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

Okay.

The other day when you said you
loved me, I didn't really respond.

Yes, you did. You said"Thanyou.
You were very courteous.

's tt don'ha taking that
extra step is really hard me.

Welldon't woy about it. I'm sure
you'l that step en it's appropriate.

Oh, look, chamgne.

is it special occasion?

Every night with you
is a special occasion.

I'm going to miss you, sir.

Oh, dear. I hope I'm not
having a massive coronary.

Oh, my God, are you all right?

I'm not sure. Yes, I'm fine.

The one waiter in L.A. who's not an actor.
- What?

Nothing. Nothing. A toast.

To saying what we feel.

What the hell did I just swallow?

A one-bedroom
condo. - What?

I put a diamond ring
in your champagne glass.

Why?

What do you mean "why?"

I was going to propose and I had no
idea you'd chug it like a Jell-O shot.

That was a ring I just swallowed?

Who drinks champagne like that?

I was thirsty. Stop yelling at me!

How in God's name could
you swallow it so easily?

Hey, that's one of the
things you love about me!

Problem?
- No problem. Go away.

Car's outside, window's open.

Let's go.
- Where?

The emergency room.
- Why?

Because I have a ring in my stomach!

Oh, don't worry about
that. You'll be fine.

How do you know?

When Jake was little, he
swallowed a handful of nickels.

Nothing bad happened.

Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

He still shoots one out every now
and then. Bets me heads or tails.

Just between you and me, I'm not
even sure they're the same nickels.

Trust me.

A couple cups of coffee in
the morning, problem solved.

I suppose you're right.

So, what do you say?

What do I say about what?

I asked you to marry me.

No, yodidn't.

Well, I was about to until
you ruined the moment.

I ruined the moment?

Okay. Okay, there's no
sense in assigning blame.

The point is, I'm proposing.

You want to marry me.
- Yes. I love you.

I don't know what to say.

Say you love me and you'll marry me.

Gee, Charlie, you're kind of
putting me on the spot here.

Yeah, well, that's kind of built
into the whole proposal concept.

Oh, come on, just say
it so we can be even.

Ev? Is that what thiisbout?
Some kind of power thing?

N-no, no, no. I meant so that
we could be even... closer.

Right.

Okay, that was lame.

But don't blame me, blame my shrink.
- What?

If I was properly medicated, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

Boy, this keeps getting
more and more romantic.

Look, do you love me or not?

I guess so.
- No guessing. That's not how the process works.

All right, I love you.
- Oh, great! Great, good.

That's all I wanted.

But I won't marry you.
- What?

Oh, yeah, right. That's okay, no biggie.

I just got out of a marriage.
I'm not ready to do it again.

That's fine. I understand.

I'm not saying "no," I'm
just saying "not now."

Hey, "not now" is my
favorite time for a wedding.

The important thing is
that we love each other.

Right.
- Equally.

Yes. -
Fifty-fifty.

If it means that much to you.

Come on, say it again. I love you.

No.

Why not?

I want to see the ring first.

Hey, Berta?

Where do we keep the
spaghetti strainer thingie?

It's called a "colander."
What do you need it for?

It's not for me. It's for Chelsea.

Okay, what kind of Martha Stewart
freak show you got going up there?

Trust me, you don't need the details.

I don't want the details

I just need to know whether to wash
it or throw it away when you're done.

Oh, I think you'll
want to throw it away.

Morning.
- Hey, Alan.

Congratulate me. I'm kind of engaged.

So she said "yes"?

Not exactly.

You gave her the ring, right?
- Yep.

Well, what did she say?

You had to be there.

Okay. So, have you set a date?

For what?
- The wedding.

What wedding? Nobody's getting
married. I'm just engaged.

When do we get to see this rock?

Well, Chelsea just finished her
second cup of coffee, so I'd guess...

15, 20 minutes.

Anybody understand
what that was all about?

I think Chelsea swallowed some nickels.

Chelse.
- Yeah?

You've been in there for
awhile. How's it going?

Just fine.

You need any help?

I brought Alan's little poop stool.

Go away!

All right,all right.

But just rember,when you
hear a metallic clink,stop.

I think I can handle it.

I'm just saying,it's not on
my homeowner's policy yet,

so if you flush it by
mistake,I'm screwed.

Charlie,I swearif you don't
walk away from that door,

I will eat a block of cheese and
you will never see that ring again!

Okay,I'm walking.

Good.

Love you.

Don't push it, Charlie!

Right back at you.

Oh,Charlie, it's beautiful.

.......... ********** ..........

Chelsea?

Yeah?

You okay?

I think I'm coming down with a cold.

That doesn't sound like a cold it
sounds like quitting time in Bedrock.

Do I feel hot to you?

- Let me see.
- Stop it.

You're supposed to feel my head.

Yeahbut those babies
are my frame of reference.

Maybe I should go home.

Wellif you think that's
the right thing to do.

Charlieit's the middle
of the night and I'm sick.

I'm not going home.

Then why'd you say you were?

I was testing you.

YeahwellI knew that
and I was testing you.

I think we both did very well.

Tell you what you get
a good night's sleep.

I'm sure you'll feel
better in the morning.

Where are you going?

I'm gonna go crash on the couch let
you have the whole bed to yourself.

Really? You're gonna
leave me here alone?

NonoI just thought you
might want your own space.

You knowwhen dogs are sick
they hide till they feel better.

Probably why they're man's best friend.

Could you please stay?

Pretty please?

How can I say no?

Seriouslyhow?

Spoon?

Try and stop me.

So whatyou're just gonna swallow that?

Go to sleep.

What are you doing?

Come onyou know what
happens when we spoon.

I'm sick.

Obviouslyso am I.

All rightfine.

Go ahead.

This is another testisn't it?

Two and a Half Men
Season 06 Episode18

Coming up next on Turner Classic
Movies: The Bridges of Madison County.

I am not gonna cry.

What are you doing up?

Watching a Clint Eastwood movie.

What are you doing up?

Chelsea's sick.

She was coughing and
sneezing all over the place.

Ohno.

Yeah.I had to wait till
she finally fell asleep

so I could get the hell outta
there without pissin' her off.

How considerate.

What do you want from me?
I'm not a big phlegm fan.

This isn't a Clint Eastwood movie.

Yesit is.

Even Clint Eastwood doesn't think
this is a Clint Eastwood movie.

WelltoughI like it.

Sureyou do. You're
a giant fruit basket.

I'll never apologize for my femine side.

BoyI hope she gets better soon.

This sick stuff is not
what I signed on for.

You're kiddingright?

This is exactly what you signed on for.

You told Chelsea you loved her
you gave her an engagement ring.

This is what it's all about.

Being there for her no matter what.

For richer or poorer better or
worse in sickness and in health.

Call me crazy but I prefer
richer better and health.

Wellregardlessthis could
be a real opportunity for you.

Opportunity for what
a massive infection?

An opportunity to show her
that she can depend on you.

That you're not just
there for the good times.

OkayI hear that.

- But tell me one thing.
- Yeah?

What's in it for me?

Watch Clint and Meryl.
Learn how to love.

I'll take my chances in the snot locker.

I will not cry.

Charlie?

You awake?

BoyI hope not.

I feel awful.

Really? You look swell.

I should go home.

Nononono. I am not
falling for that again.

You stay right herelet
me take care of you.

You mean it?

Ohmando I have to mean ittoo?

Just kiddin'. Can I make
you some tea or something?

- Yesplease.
- Comin' up.

- With honey?
- Sure.

And maybe an English muffin.

No problem.

Toasted crispy.

Right.

And let the butter melt into all the nooks
and crannies before you put the jam on.

Anything else?

Can I have a hug?

Try and stop me.

Nice necklace.

Thanks.

Buy it for yourself?

Noa girl gave it to me.

Really? She must like you.

Yeahshe's nuts for me.

Wellis she cute?

I guess.

Youuhyou don't seem
very happy about it.

I'm not.

Why? What's the problem?

She's nine.

Nine? Where would you
meet a nine-year-old girl?

We're in the same math class.

Isuhis she one of
those advanced students?

Sadlyno.

But she does help me with my homework.

HeyBertaChelsea's not feeling well.

Could you make her some
tea and an English muffin?

SureIcould.

But you won't.

Is that what you're saying?

Where are the muffins?

In the fridge. As always.

Don't condescend to me.

He does it to me all the
time. It's very irritating.

No one's talking to you.

See? Like that.

That wasn't condescending.

But that wasright?

Right...

Boyas soon as I get my
licenseI am so outta here.

Sure. You can drive your
girlfriend to Gymboree.

At least I have a girlfriend.

At least I have a girlfriend.

So what's the deal?
DoesuhChelsea have a cold?

I'm not sure.

Coldflusomething disgusting.

Maybe she has an STD.

What?

It means "sexually transmitted disease."

I know what STD's are.

Your uncle helped invent them.

You knowthey can be
prevented by using a condom.

I know we could've prevented
you by using a condom.

Now we gotta use a hammer.

I don't understand.

Go get me a hammer and I'll show you.

Okay.

You must be so proud.

Ball peen or claw hammer?

Do me a favor when he
comes backjust do it.

Okayhere we go. Room service.

Chelsea? Honey?

- Don't come in.
- Wasn't even tempted.

I got your tea and muffins.

I have diarrhea. I can't eat now.

I may never eat again.

Would you mind going
to the drugstore for me?

For youI'd go to the ends of the earth.

Coming back's a whole other question.

What?

I said"What do you need?"

WellI need Pepto and we're almost out
of tissues and I need some decongestant

some cough syrup something
for canker sores and wet wipes.

For your hands?

- No.
- Got it.

And I'm probably gonna
need some tampons.

Ohgreat. There's gonna be bloodtoo.

You're really being wonderful
about all this Charlie.

Ohit's nothing.

It's what a guy does
when he loves somebody.

Should've known.

The second you give 'em a
ring they fall out of warranty.

HeyRussell?

What's good for canker sores?

You got canker sores?

Nomy girlfriend. What do you recommend?

Tennis shoes.

- Excuse me?
- Put 'em on and run away.

There's a lot of broads
out there. Find a clean one.

I
- I can't run away.

I'm kind of engaged to her.

OhCharlieno.

Yup. I bit the bullet.

You bit the big one.

Heyjust because you blew three marriages
doesn't mean I can't make this work.

You're a funny guyCharlie.

And that's not just
the Oxycontin talking.

Here you go.
Cank-B-Gone.

What else?

Uhlet's see. Cough syrup.

Regular or codeine?

Don't you need a
prescription for codeine?

What are youa cop?

Here. I'll give you the
kid stuff. What else?

Uhtissues throat lozenges
decongestant Peptowet wipes.

Geezwhere'd you find this
one? A hospital parking lot?

Come onRussellhelp me out.

Okay. Okayhere you go.

A dam for every river.

A plug for every jug.

OhrightI almost forgot.
She also needs tampons.

Ohlucky you.

What size?

How should I know?

Is there some kind of a
condom-tampon conversion chart?

Nobut that's an amusing idea.

Actuallyit's not about sizeper se.

It's more about flow.

Okayseethat's a piece of information I could
have gone the rest of my life without knowing.

Here you go. Here's a variety pack.

This'll handle anything from
a little drizzle to a monsoon.

Listenis it too late to change
my mind about the codeine?

The first one's free.

Okaygot all your stuff.

Took you long enough.

I just went shopping for
wet wipes and tampons.

I'm allowed to take my time.

I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?

No. No. Why would I be mad at you?

'Cause I'm sick and you
have to take care of me.

Are you kidding me? I
love taking care of you.

I just... love... it.

YeahI can see that.

Listencould you go over to my place and get
me some clean clothes and feed Sir Lancelot?

- Who?
- My cat.

He's not gonna feed himself Charlie.

Are you sure? Maybe you've got mice.

And you're probably gonna have
to change the litter boxtoo.

Change it into what?

You got to scoop out the
poop and put in fresh litter.

Ohthis just keeps
getting better and better.

- Charlie?
- Yeah?

- I love you.
- Great.

Aren't you gonna say it back?

I'm gonna go pan for cat turds.

If that doesn't say "I
love you" nothing does.

I promiseI'm wearing it.

Wait a sec.

OkayI sent you a picture.

Now what's the answer to number four?

Ohyeah. That's what I had.

What you doingAlan?

My taxes. I promised myself I wouldn't
wait till the last minute this year.

Yeahand you promised me you'd only stay here
for a few days so your word means nothing.

Come onyou're driving me to Chelsea's.

Why don't you drive yourself?

Because I just chugged a
half a bottle of codeine

and this bourbon might make me
a bit of a threat on the road.

Ahgood call.

Herekittykitty.

Herekittykittykitty.

OkayI got her clean clothes.

Great.

Now I just got to feed the damn cat.

Come onSir Lancelot.

Come out and eat your kibble.

Son of a bitch!

I'm pretty sure if you just put the food out
he'll find it and eat it when he's hungry.

Really?You'd think if he was that smart

he'd just crap in the toilet
instead of a litter box.

Ohuhdid you change the litter yet?

No. I was actually gonna
offer you $20 to do it.

- I'll take it.
- Deal...

I would have done it for ten.

I would have given you a thousand.

Big cat.

You know what I just realized Alan?

Cough syrup and hard liquor don't mix?

Nothey're delightful.

I'm thinking that sooner or later
Chelsea's gonna want to move in with me.

Yeahif you marry her
that's a chance you take.

And she's probably gonna
want to bring Sir Craps-a-lot.

You never know.

He might want to get his own place.

I'm guessing he will before you will.

OhLord.

This cat's been eating more than kibble.

This turd's got feathers.

You knowthere's a real chance that someday
without any kind of warning whatsoever

Chelsea will up and
decide to get sick again.

And we're on the air with codeine
and bourbon. Go aheadcaller.

I'm just sayingI don't think
I can go through it again.

I'm not cut out to be a caregiver.

Wellyou might not think
so but you're doing it.

I meanyouCharlie Harper are unselfishly
taking care of the woman you love.

Maybe sobut...

it's getting harder
and harder to love her.

You don't mean that.

OhAlan if you'd seen and heard the
things I have in the last 24 hours

it'd turn you gayer than a French horn.

Excuse me but I have
witnessed childbirth.

I saw my son's enormous head poke out of what
used to be one of my very favorite places.

Thanks for the image.

I'll never be able to watch
the kid pull on a sweater again.

Trust me.If you hang in
there and show Chelsea

that you'll stick by her even
when she's not at her best

she will love you more deeply and
intensely than you ever could have imagined.

And you know this how?

How else? Chick flicks.

This is not a kitty cat.

This is a mountain lion.

Look.

You need some more orange juice?

Nothank you.

It was so nice of you to bring
some up without me even asking.

Don't tell Charlie.

It's taken a long time to train
him not to expect anything from me.

Yeah.

He really is crazy about youyou know.

You think?

Are you kidding?

Charlie doesn't go near sick women.

I meanphysically sick.

Around here one sneeze will get you
cab fare and a complimentary travel mug.

I have noticed he's trying very hard.

Just rember when it comes to nurturing
Charlie's like a dog playing the piano.

You can't fault him if
he hits a few bum notes.

You just got to applaud the effort and
hope he doesn't whiz all over the keys.

I understand.

ThanksBerta.

Just so we're clear
this ain't no hotel.

You need more towels
you get 'em yourself.

Sorry about that.

You really can't expect much from her.

I won't.

Here. I got you clean
clothes and underwear.

The cat's fed and the
litter box is turd free.

Thank youCharlie. You have been
so wonderful through all of this.

I havehaven't I?

I just want you to know I am
definitely gonna make it up to you.

Chelseato be honest that's the
only thing that's kept me going.

Uh-ohwhat?

OhCharlieI'm so sorry.

Nonoit's okay.

At least it's not wicker.

Excuse me a sec.

OkayI am going to go to the
pharmacy and get your medicine.

If you get it from
Russell count the pills.

Will do. Hope you feel better.

Thanks.

Charlieyou don't mind Sir
Lancelot being heredo you?

- Nonot at all. I love cats.
- Good.

Don't scratch the door Sir Lancelot!

Did you clean my litter box?

Ohcome on. I've been sick.

Fine. I'll just use your facilities.

Not in the tub this timeokay?

Your houseyour rules.

I'm not gonna make it.

Yesyou are.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, come on, Melissa.

How long are you gonna
keep punishing me for this?

Okay, okay, uh, once again, uh, I did not
technically have sex with your mother.

You want to catch me up?

- Melissa, are you gonna let me talk?
- Well, you know Alan was nailing his receptionist, right?

Yeah.

- Apparently, she caught him in bed with her mother.
- Are you gonna let me talk?

What do you know?

I've been calling him that for
years, and now he's up and done it.

I was not responsible for my actions.
I was stoned out of my mind.

You know, that excuse has
never once worked for me.

Me, either. Copsorboyfriends.

No. Hey, hey, hey, your mother put
enough pot in that bana bread

to treat every case of glaucoma
in the San Fernando Valley.

I have a recipe for
macaroons. Very similar.

I was so high, I didn't
even know who she was.

We were just colors.

I was red, she was blue.

We were trying to make purple.

Honey, my phone's dead.
Can I borrow your cell?

- Sure. It's on the coffee table.
- Thanks.

Okay, so-so bottom line, I was drugged and
molested by your mother, andI'mthe bad guy?

Man, how many times have I
heard you make this phone call?

Yeah, who'd have thought, of the two of us, I'd be
the one to end up in a healthy, stable relationship?

Who is Rachel, and why is she
sending you topless photos?

Yeah, who'd have thought?

Transcript: SFile.YDY.com

Sync: ßÇÈâÈâ

S06E19:
The Two Finger Rule

You want to explain to me why this woman
is sending you naked pictures of herself?

I'd love to explain it.

Go ahead.

I said I'd love to.
I didn't say I could.

Are you sleeping with her?

No, no, of course not.

Then why the pictures?

Uh, well, my-my-my-my... my best guess
would be that, like a lot of girls,

she wanted to show off her new boob job.

That'syour best guess?

Well, you wouldn't understand because clearly,
God has blessed you with this great bounty.

- Damn it, Charlie, I want to know...
- Excuse me. I am on the phone.

Alan's on the phone.

Don't shush me. Who is this Rachel?

Nobody really.

I used to go out with her way, way before
you and I met and I fell so deeply in love.

Head-over-heels in love.
Puppy dog love. Woof!

Hang on, Melissa. I couldn't hear
anything after "You son of a bitch."

Does this Rachel know you're engaged?

Think long and hard before
you start lying to me.

I was. That's why I said, "Um..."

- Charlie...
- She doesn't know.

Why not?

Boy, you're gonna keep this
flapjack on the griddle, aren't you?

Berta, would you give us a minute?

Oh, you're gonna need more than a minute.

So long. I'm gonna miss you.

What are you talking about?
She's not going anywhere.

Are you? Where-where
you going? Chelsea?

Chelsea, wait.

Can't we just put this behind us?

I
- I swear I'll never make out with your mother again.

Let's face it, Charlie. We both knew
you were gonna blow it eventually.

I didn't. I had my
suspicions, but I wasn't sure.

I wish I could say the same. Good-bye.

- Oh, please don't leave.
- Oh, please don't hang up.

I love you!

And I love you, too.

Sure you don't want a drink?

No. When I'm depressed, alcohol
just makes me feel worse.

Yeah, see, the trick
is to drink past that.

Not a sprint, it's a marathon.

You ever think we're both doomed
to grow old alone and unloved?

A couple of pathetic bachelors with
no one to talk to but each other?

You ought to do ads for this stuff.

So, are you gonna tell me
what happened with Chelsea?

I can show you.

Chelsea found this on my phone.

I ask you, is that worth
breaking an engagement?

It's worth breaking a spine.

Were you sleeping with this girl?

No. No. She just sent me a few pictures.

Well, then, why'd you keep 'em?

All right, all right, all right.

But you got to understand the-the
message that this sends to Chelsea.

Other than, you know, "Got milk?"

But I'm not cheating.

There are other forms of cheating.
There's, uh... there's, uh, flirting.

There's fantasizing about other women...

Oh, come on. Fantasizing is not cheating.

To women it is. They-they don't like the idea that
you're mentally replacing them with someone else.

What if I'm mentally
supplementingthem with someone else?

You know, like I'm making love to Chelsea, and
in my mind, Rachel here is just helping out.

She does look very helpful.

Nevertheless, I-I can understand why
Chelsea would take a dimmer view.

Yeah, well, I think she overreacted.

In fact, I think she owes me an apology.

Really? So, you're just gonna sit here and
wait till she comes crawling back, are you?

Yes, I am.

And then, because hell will long since
have frozen over, we can go ice-skating.

It's good that you have a plan.

Now if you will pardon me, I have
to go pick up Jake at his mother's.

Oh, good. Just what we need
to brighten up our weekend.

A large, sullen teenager with
gas and questionable hygiene.

There's nothing questionable about it.

There we go. Over the hump.

She's my mother, Herb! I want
her here when I have the baby!

Yeah, well, I don't need yet another woman in
this house yelling at me, calling me an idiot!

My mother doesn't yell, you idiot!

Okay, I'm gonna let that
pass because you're pregnant!

Don't you dare blame this on hormones!

What's my alternative, Judith?
Accept the fact that I'm an idiot?

Oh, hey, Alan.

Is this a bad time?

They're all bad.

Seven-and-a-half
months of bad.

Don't you walk away from me.

Well, I'm sorry. I was
answering the door!

That's what we idiots do
when we hear a doorbell.

Hi, Dad. Bye, Mom. Good luck, Herb.

Bye, Jake. Wish I was going with you.

I knew it as soon as
it came out of my mouth.

I could get used to this.

Don't.

As far as Charlie is
concerned, mi casa es mi casa.

All right, I've ordered
your pizza. I'm going home.

Thanks, Berta.

Ordering a pizza and going home- two
of the three things you want in a woman.

And you wonder why Chelsea dumped you.

I'll tell you what I wonder.

I wonder how you could possibly get
stoned enough to stick your tongue

in the mouth of a
60-year-old woman.

Zing!

Boy, I just love this male bonding.
Giving each other the old business.

The old business?

Yeah, you know, the needle,
the zetz, the razzmatazz.

Herb, I got to ask you something.

Are there any other
guys you hang out with?

Oh, sure, I have my peeps.

There's my, uh, water polo league,
the guys down at the model train shop.

Oh, and my, uh, barbershop quartet.

Although I can't have them
over to the house anymore.

Why not?

Four part harmony triggers
Judith's migraines.

Plus, mustaches creep her out.

Oh, not just mustaches.
Any facial hair whatsoever.

Except eyebrows.

- Neatly trimmed.
- Right. The two finger rule.

Chelsea had a two finger rule.

Nothing to do with eyebrows, though.

All right, I'll see you later.

Where are you going?

Down to the pier with Celeste.

- Who's Celeste?
- My girlfriend. She lives next door.

Is she pretty?

She's gorgeous and smart and popular.

- No kidding?
- We don't get it, either.

Maybe she's punishing her father.

Let's hope so.

You know, I'm just the stepdad here,
but, uh, shouldn't you tell him what time to be home?

I don't have to. I know her father.

Hey, Jake.

Hello, sir.

Celeste, Jake's here!
So how have you been?

We're walking down to the pier, we're
gonna play skeeball, we'll be back by 11:00.

You're damn right you will.

Come on. It's freezing out here.

Shouldn't we put out the cigars?

Why?

'cause we're not allowed
to smoke in the house?

It's my house. We can smoke cigars,
we can smoke salmon, whatever we want.

Are you sure?

Relax. No whiny broad
is going to nag at you.

Uh, Herb, make sure you use
an ashtray and a coaster.

I stand corrected.

Zing!

Hotcha!

Oh, this is going to be a long night.

Hi, Charlie.

Oh, God. What did the
little knucklehead do?

Nothing- Jake said you guys were hanging
out, and I thought you might want some company.

Sure, come on in.

I baked snickerdoodles if you're hungry.

- You baked snickerdoodles?
- Yeah- why is that funny?

It's not.

You know Alan, and this is Herb.

Make yourself comfortable. Can
I get you something to drink?

I wouldn't say no to an apple-tini.

An apple-tini? My brother
drinks apple-tinis.

Why is that funny?

It's not.

One apple-tini coming up.

He can get away with it; you can't.

So, how do you know Charlie and Alan?

Oh, I'm married to Alan's ex-wife.

No kidding. And you hang out?

- Yeah.
- Sure.

I couldn't be friends with the
man who's putting it to my ex.

Well, to be fair, there hasn't
been a lot of putting lately.

And after the baby's born,
there will be even less.

How is that possible?

Not only will she not let you touch her, she'll
interrupt you while you're touching yourself.

I had to start showering at the Y.

- Okay, one apple-tini.
- Thank you.

What are you guys talking about?

Masturbating at the YMCA.

Really? Just talk, right?

Yeah, but the night is young.

So, Jerome...

solve one of the great
mysteries of life for us.

What does your daughter see in Jake?

You know, I've been asking
myself the same thing.

Maybe she's punishing me.

- No offense.
- None taken.

We're way ahead of you.

You know, my wife and I are
having a girl. Any advice?

Yeah. Before your daughter
starts dating, um, bulk up.

Okay.

Boy. Remember when we
first started dating?

Yep, eighth grade. Louise Miller.

Oh, ninth grade. Maxine Chernakoff.

Sixth grade, Mrs. Terapotta.

Wasn't actually a date.

Nowadays, she'd probably go to jail.

So, uh, what about you, Herb?

What about me, what?

Uh, your first date.
Uh, junior high, high school?

College, freshman year. I was
kind of a geek in high school.

Hard to believe.

No, really. They called me Big Bird.

So, what happened in college?

I stopped wearing yellow
shirts and lowered my standards.

Okay, okay. Here's one.

First sexual experience that
was not traditional intercourse.

What are we talking about here?

You know what I'm talking about.

Boy Scouts?

What?

Zing!

Alan. When did you first
take your oral exams?

Oh, I... I-I don't think I should say.

- Why not?
- I just don't.

Come on, Alan, we're all
friends. Who was it?

Your wife.

So, your first time doing
that was with Judith?

Hey, me, too.

Me, too.

Just kidding-
zing, zing!

What is "zing"? Is that
some type of white guy slang?

Quite possibly.

My barbershop quartet does a killer version
of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart".

Real showstopper.

Kind of like that story.

Zing!

Did I get that one right?

Oh, good. Finally.

- Hookers?
- Pizza.

That's nice, too.

- Hey, Mr. Harper.
- Oh, hey, Gordon.

- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, two years.

So, what you been up to?

Well, I, uh... I finished night
school, got my business degree,

met an amazing girl and got married,
landed a great job as a stockbroker.

The company went under,
my wife left me, and, uh...

that'll be $28.50

Oh, man, I'm sorry. You want a drink?

Why stop now?

Come on in.

Hey, everybody. This is
Gordon. His wife left him.

- Hi, Gordon.
- Welcome to the losers lounge.

Glad to be here.

The topic of discussion is first
nontraditional sexual experience.

Bible camp.

Where do you guys want me to put these?

Oh, uh, here, let me move
the snickerdoodles.

Snickerdoodles.

You don't like them?

No, no, I do. It's just that my wife used
to call me her little snickerdoodle.

- You're kidding.
- Well, no, not all of me.

It was her little nickname for my, uh...

Oh, that is a terrible name for a penis.

Oh, yeah? What did your wife call yours?

Mr. Roundtree.

Richard Roundtree.

The guy who played Shaft.

Oh, yes.

That's way better than Snickerdoodle.

Judith calls mine "that thing".

As in, "Get that thing away from me"?

Yeah, how did you know?

Just a guess.

Okay. I'm out of here.

Where you going?

Someplace where I'm not knee-deep
in pathetic, penis-naming sad sacks.

- No offense.
- None taken.

Let's go, King Snake.

- What do you want?
- Just listen.

Rachel? Hey, it's Charlie.

Look, about the pictures you sent me...

No, no, no, they were very nice.

Yeah, real artsy.

But the thing is, I'm
kind of engaged now.

I amdefinitely engaged now, so
you shouldn't send me any more.

It doesn't matter who asked for them.

The point is, I am no longer interested
in anyone's boobs other than my fianc?e's.

No, I'm not going to send
you a picture of hers.

Right?

No. Okay, take care.

Thank you, Charlie.

I just want you to know
how much you mean to me.

Did you delete the pictures?

I guess there's a case
to be made for that.

What are you doing? Press delete.

Hang on. I'm printing them in my memory.

Delete, delete, delete. Look, I'm deleting!

Zing! Dear, when you smiled at me

Zing!I heard a melody

Zing!It haunted me from the start

Zing!Something inside of me

Zing!Started a symphony

Zing!Went the strings of my heart

Zing!'Twas like a breath of spring

Zing!I heard a robin sing

Zing!About a nest set apart

No wonder they're all alone.

Zing! All nature seemed to me

Zing!In perfect harmony

Zing!Went the strings of my heart...

Who is the man That will
risk his neck for brother man?

Shaft!

Right on I heard this
cat, Shaft, is one bad mother...

- Shut your mouth.
- Well, I'm talking about Shaft.

Then, we can dig it.

He's a complicated man...

No. I can't do this.

She has to take me back.

.......... ********** ..........

Aren't you going to wash
your hands before you eat?

No. I wrap the toilet paper around
my fingers like an oven mitt.

You could catch a puck with it.

So, Mom, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

I'm showing a house down at the beach.

Thought I'd swing by
and see my grandson.

Tada!

Nice house?

Oh, magnificent. And priced to move.

The owner lost everything in
the stock market, killed himself.

Oh, that's terrible.

Oh, no. He didn't do it
in the house. Thank God.

Even with an ocean view, suicide
homes are a bitch to unload.

Keephat in mind in case you ever
want to teach your brother a lesson.

Thanks for the tip.

Good morning, Alan.
Morning, Jake. Satan.

Good morning, darling. Two coffee cups?

Did you have a friend spend the night?

Yes, I did.

Couldn't get her to stand
on the trapdoor, huh?

Charlie, I don't have
time for coffee, so...

- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

Uh, Chelsea, this is my mother.

Mom, this is Chelsea.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

Welcome back to the States.

Thank you. Where have I been?

Charlie says you have
a place in Italy and...

You know, Chelsea, sometimes when
I'm drunk, I make up stories, so...

You know, grain of salt.

That is quite an engagement ring.

Thank you.

Does your fianc know about this one?

My fianc is thione.

You want me to put this in a travel mug?

You didn't tell your
mother we're engaged?

If she hadn't sold me the house,
she wouldn't even know where I live.

When were you going to tell
her about me? At the wedding?

Well, technically, I think we
have up to a year after that.

Shame on you. I am so sorry.

It's all right, dear. I'm used to it.

Although a phone call
would have been nice.

It's good to meet you. Excuse me.

So, yea or nay on the travel mug?

Charlie, you just broke
your mother's heart.

How is that funny?

It's not. Guys, a little respect.

What is wrong with you?

Same stuff as always, nothing new.

Does this smell like butt to you?

Half Men Season06 Episode20</font>

I'm glad you came over.

That was the plan, wasn't it?

Yeah, but I thought you
might still be angry with me.

I'm not angry, Charlie.
I'm just disappointed.

Gee, I'd kind of prefer
it if you were angry.

Why?

Because angry sex is hot.

Disappointed sex is... well,
we might as well be married.

- Just brush your teeth.
- Brushing.

Look, I understand you have a
difficult relationship with your mom.

But it makes things kind of tough on me.

Hey, I don't expect you
to dislike her right away.

Give it time. Let it happen naturally.

That's not funny.

If I'm going to marry into your family, I want
us to act like a family, care for each other.

With my family, it's kind of either/or.

Let me put it this way.

I'm taking your mother
to lunch on Thursday.

You're doing wha

I'm not going to participate in
this childish little feud of yours.

It's not a childish feud. Boy.

Come on, Charlie.

What's wrong with me having a warm and
healthy relationship with your mother?

Well, for starters,
you'll be the only one.

Ever.

Oh, don't be so dramatic.

No, no, no, no. I'm not
being dramatic enough.

I should be wearing
tights and holding a skull.

Preferably hers.

It's just lunch.

That's what Hitler said Czechoslovakia.

Hitler said, "It's just lunch"?

Well, he said it in German.

Watch the History Channel.

Charlie, I'm not doing this to hurt you.

Did you ever think that by my
spending time with your mother,

I can get a better understanding of you?

Chelsea, trust me.

Any insight you gain into me via my
mother will end our relationship faster

than catching me in
bed with a farm animal.

Just relax. It'll be fine.

That's what Hitler said to Poland.

And for the record, as long as we've been
going out, I've never met your mother.

My mother's in Illinois.

Oh, yeah, and my mother's in "Italy."

My mother really lives in Illinois.

And besides, when you meet her,

you will count your blessings you
have someone as wonderful as your mom.

Tell you what, I'll trade you.
Sight unseen, my mom for yours.

- Charlie.
- I'll even throw in Alan and a couple of Omaha steaks.

Come here.

No, I don't want to. I'm too upset.

Okay. Good night.

I'm sorry. I can't separate
my emotions from my body.

- I understand.
- I don't want to punish you.

I'm just saying, if my heart's not in it, then
it's just my penis going through the motions.

Well, we certainly wouldn't want that.

- Good night.
- Good night.

17*****

Chelsea?

I'm not upset anymore.

Charlie, I'm sleeping.

I know.

Can you just wake up
enough so it's not weird?

Never mind. Sweet dreams.

Okay, let me remind you, this
is Malibu beachfront property.

The previous owner had a spectacular
view as he filled his pockets with rocks

and jumped into the pool.

- Mom?
- Hang on.

No, it's not a suicide home.

At most it's... suicide adjacent.

All right, get back to me.

What are you doing here?

What, I can't come
visit my mother at work?

Well, I suppose you could, but I've been
here for 22 years and you never have.

Well, maybe if you validated parking.

Or any part of my life.

What do you want, Charlie?

Okay, first of all, I want to apologize for not
telling you about Chelsea and the engagement.

I know that was wrong and selfish of me.

Thank you.

Good, I'm glad we got
that out of the way.

So, I understand you guys
are having lunch tomorrow.

Yes, we are. Is that a problem?

No, no, no, it's great.

I came all the way down here and paid
for my own parking to tell you it's great.

All right, let's put
our cards on the table.

What's your angle?

Angle? I have no angle.

Yeah, and I have no hangover.

Look, Charlie, if you're really
going to marry this woman,

I want to get started on
the right foot with her.

I don't want to make the same
mistake I made with Alan's wife June.

Judith.

Oh, whatever.

Heinous woman.

The fact remains, had I overlooked
that and welcomed her into the family,

she wouldn't have kept me at arm's
length all during Jake's formative years

and I'd have a better
relationship with him today.

Do you want a better
relationship with him?

Not the way he is now.

But if I'd gotten to him earlier, he
wouldn't have the manners of an outhouse rat.

So, bottom line: you want a
good relationship with Chelsea

so you can get your hooks
into the next generation?

Can't I just want to be a
loving mother and grandmother?

Well, I suppose you could, but I've
been here 40 years and you never have.

Evelyn Harper.

Oh, hello, Dr. Yakimora. What's up?

That is good news. What's the address?

Nice neighborhood. Thanks for the tip.

What's the good news?

Massive coronary in Brentwood.

Six bedrooms, four baths, and a fully equipped
gym that that idiot shouldn't have been using.

Now, if you'll excuse me, Mommy has
to fly faster than the other vultures.

You mother took me to the most
adorable little restaurant.

No kidding.

It's called Mon Grenier du Vivre.

You know what that means?

Probably "The Spider's Web."

Charlie...

The Devil's Barbecue?

Be nice.

Sorry.

Bitch in the Box?

So what did you guys talk about?

You know, everything.

She's so smart and funny.

She's been through so
much. She's a real survivor.

Just remember, in order for her to
be a survivor, others had to die.

Okay, that's enough. Your
mom's a terrific lady.

And I'm starting to think that any problem
you have with her is your problem, not hers.

Oh, damn, it's too late.

You're infected with the virus.

Stop it.

I'm sorry, but when you fall asleep
tonight, I'm gonna have to set you on fire.

Shut up.

Believe me, Charlie, when you meet
my mom, you'll thank God for Evelyn.

What the hell is your mom, a rabid
werewolf that craps hot lava on people?

Never mind about my mother. Let's play.

I don't know.

What's the matter?

All this talk about
mothers, I'm not in the mood.

I bet I could get you in the mood.

Maybe, but it'd be a cheap manipulation.

All right, but don't come rubbing up
against me in the middle of the night.

I won't.

- Fine. Good night.
- Good night.

22*********

Don't even think about it.

Listen, you gotta do me a favor.

That's what I live for.

Sarcasm is for winners, Alan.

What can I do for you?

Chelsea's somehow gotten it
into her head that Mom is,

you know, human, and you
need to set her straight.

Why don't you set her straight?

I tried, but she doesn't believe me.

Probably because I turned out okay.

She needs to hear about Mom from somebody whose life
is completely wrecked and unsalvageable, i.e., you.

Thanks. And what do
you expect me to say?

I don't know.Just tell
her about your phobias,

your obsessions, your failures
with work, marriage, and parenthood.

She'll connect the dots.

You know what? I think I'll pass.

Oh, come on. I always back
you up when you need me.

When have you ever backed me up?

Okay, let's just stay
focused on my problems.

Listen, Charlie, I'm not gonna argue
that we didn't have a difficult childhood,

but really, who had a good one?

And isn't it time we forgive and forget?

Where's this coming from?

No, I'm just saying that
maybe our lives would be richer

if we let go of this pointless
resentment toward our mother and,

and just moved on with our lives.

She got to you, didn't she?

What are you talking about?

What did she do? Pay off your car?

Get that dead black tooth fixed?

Oh, listen to yourself. Excuse
me. I have to go to work.

- Hold it.
- What?

- Your watch.
- What about it?

It doesn't have Hamburglars
on the wristband.

So?

- Let me see it.
- No, it's mine.

Let me see it! Let me see it!

This is a Rolex.

You sold me out for a watch.

Hey, I did not sell you out for a watch!

I sold you out for a
certified Swiss chronometer.

Stainless steel Submariner,
waterproof up to 300 mets.

And look, it winds itself.

Put it on your right
arm, it'll run forever.

Oh, good thinking.

Oh, hey, look what else I got.

Genuine porcelain veneer.

From an English-speaking dentist.

From an English-speaking dentist.

Hey, Jake, I need a favor.

Sorry, I can't say bad
things about Grandma.

Okay, what did she buy you?

A new guitar? Minibike?

Pizza.

You sold me out for a pizza?

Not just a pizza. A meat-lover's pizza.

* M is for the misery she caused me

* O is for the other things she did

* T is for the traitor who's my brother

* H is for the...hump who is his kid

No, it's true. They can
bleach anything these days.

Really? It's gotta burn like hell.

Oh, like a lit cigar.

But it's worth . Curb appeal
isn't just for the front door.

* E is for extremely
frightening girl talk.

Hey, honey.

How was shopping?

Mom, pick up any new souls?

Charlie, that's uncalled for.

It's okay, Chelsea.
He can't help himself.

Yes, he can.

There's no excuse for speaking
to your mother that way.

You don't know that.

Evelyn, thank you for a wonderful day.

The pleasure was mine. It's nice
to be appreciated for a change.

- Are we on for yoga tomorrow?
- Can't wait.

Oh, and of course, you and Charlie
are coming for dinner on Saturday.

- We wouldn't miss it.
- Um, uh, actually...

Chels, we have plans
on Saturday, remember?

What plans?

Oh, for God's sake,
can't you just play along?

- We'll be there.
- Wonderful. Ta-ta.

- Are you proud of yourself?
- Not really. I lost that one.

* R is for the rifle in my mouth

* Put them all together,
they spell "mother"

* A word that's only half of how I feel.

Hello, I am Alan Cousteau.

I left the Calypso at...0500 hours,

and have descended to
a depth of 60 fathoms.

And yet my Rolex is
keeping perfect time.

Oh, ok, there goes a giant squid.

Alan?

Yes?

What are you doing?

I got no good answer.

It's Saturday night, and I'm all alone.

Do you know where Charlie is?

We're supposed to be at
your mother's at 7:00.

Oh, you are cutting it close.

Have you seen him?

Uh, not for a couple of
hours. Have you tried his cell?

I did. There's no answer.
I'm getting worried.

Chelsea, I'm home.

Thank goodness.

I return to the deep.

Where have you been?

Picking up a little
surprise for you. Come on in.

Mom?

Hello, sweetie.

Ooh, feels like you gave
up on the Jenny Craig, huh?

What are you doing here?

I flew her in from Illinois.

First class. Very swanky.

Of course, I had some rich Jew lawyer
chewing my ear off the whole way.

Tell her about the food.

Oh, the food was terrific, but the
flight attendant was a colored homo.

I'm glad they make 'em pick up the dinner
rolls with tongs 'cause I can't risk the AIDS.

I hope you didn't fill up.

We're going to my mom's for dinner.

Oh, how nice.

Now be honest with me, Charlie.

You're sdark and handsome, you
gotta have some dago in ya, right?

God, I love your mom.

That was the worst dinner of my life.

Really? I thought the
two moms hit it off.

Kinda country mouse, city mouse.

I especially liked the partrt when
country mouse kicked off her shoes,

put her big yellow bunions on
city mouse's mahogany coffee table

and asked her how she liked having
a commie A-rab for a president.

You've made your point, Charlie.

Point? Whatever do you mean?

You leave my mother alone,
and I'll leave yours alone.

Well, gosh, I don't know.

I've really taken a shine to your mom.

She promised to teach me how to
chew tobacco and burn a cross.

Do we have a deal or not?

Deal. Come here.

I'm not in the mood.

All right, but don't be rubbing up
against me in the middle of the night.

Don't worry. I won't. Good night.

Good night.

All right, I was bluffing.

Feel free to rub.

Ruyourself.

- Chels?
- What?

Can you watch me so it's not weird?

.......... ********** ..........

 Here in my car, I feel safest of all

 I can lock all my doors

 It's the only way to live

 In cars...

Whatcha doin'?

Building an original 1978 Firebird.

Got it on eBay.

Okay.

Why?

I had this model when I was little, remember?

I spent a month building it and painting it

and putting on all the decals.

Is that the one I tried to make a bong out of?

No, that was my Munster Mobile.

And my ventriloquist dummy.

And my Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

My Firebird you blow-torched

with a cigarette lighter and Mom's Aqua Net.

Oh, yeah, the "Fire"-bird.

Anyway, I loved that model and now I'm gonna have it again.

I am gonna have it again, right?

Relax.

If I destroy any of your cars,

it'll be that oil-dripping piece of crap

out there in my garage.

 Here in my car

 I can only receive

 I can listen to you

 It keeps me stable for days

 In cars...

I'm worried about my brother.

#NAME?

he's either so lonely,

he's trying to recapture his childhood,

which was not that good in the first place,

or he's created an elaborate ruse to hide the fact

that he's become a degenerate glue-sniffer.

To be honest, I'm rootin' for the glue.

You know, I've been meaning to talk to you about him.

You want him gone? He's gone.

That's how much I love you.

No, no, he's a wonderful guy.

I actually have a friend that I think might be a good match for him.

Oh, no, you're wrong.

Oh, come on, Charlie.

Listen...

 ...started to think

 About leaving tonight

 Although nothing seemed...

You don't want to do that to a friend, do you?

Alan's a doll.

He just needs to find the right woman.

If you check his closet,

you'll find the right woman is a doll.

At least let me try.

I'll set up a dinner with the four of us.

It'll be fun.

For who?

It's bad enough you want to punish your friend.

Why do I have to suffer?

Isn't it worth one night of your life

to maybe make two people happy?

That's not fair.

I always come off bad

when I answer questions like that truthfully.

Just do it for me.

Is that a yes?

Remember those words when we go to bed tonight.

What words?

Just do it for me.

So, anyway,

he's Charlie's brother and a very sweet guy

and I really think you'll like him.

Boy, I don't know.

Blind dates.

You never know what kind of freak you're gonna end up with.

-So you don't know her name?  -Nope.

-And you don't know what she does?   -Nope.

And you don't know what she looks like?

What do you care?

You were gonna spend the night building a scale model

of The Dukes of Hazzard car.

actually.  I just finished it

Now I'm working on Burt Reynolds' Trans Am

from Smokey and the Bandit.

Okay, okay, just promise me

you won't bring any of that up tonight.

Why? Why?!

You're asking me why a 40-year-old man shouldn't talk

about model cars on a first date?

I see your point.

Leave a little mystery.

Yeah, that's my point.

Come on.

Oh, speaking of mystery,

I am currently the high bidder

on an original, mint in the box Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.

How do I look?

Don't open that can of worms.

You are what you are.

There's Chelsea.

-Sorry we're late.  -No, no,

-we were early.  -You look great!

Thank you. So do you.

Charlie, Alan, this is my friend Rose.

Rose,

this is Charlie and Alan.

It's nice to meet you, Alan.

No, that's Charlie.

Ooh, even better.

Hi, Alan.

Hi.

Why don't we all sit down?

So many reasons.

Chelsea's told me so much about you boys.

It-It's so nice to finally meet you.

Alan, I understand you're a chiropractor.

Yes.

I'm a chiropractor.

Charlie?

Yes.

He is a chiropractor.

Oh, that's just terrific.

And what do you do, Charlie?

Um...

I write kids' songs and jingles.

Alan?

Yes.

He writes kids' songs and jingles.

And I am a chiropractor.

Yes, he's a chiropractor.

They don't get out much, do they?

Apparently not.

So, Chelsea, where did you meet...

Rose.

Right.

Rose.

Yoga class.

No kiddin'.

Yeah.

And then we ran into each other at Pilates,

and the manicurist,

and jogging,

and the dry cleaner.

Crazy, huh?

Sure are. Sure is.

Seemed like every time I turned around, there she was.

Seemed like every time I turned around, there you were.

I thought maybe you were stalking me.

That's funny.

Good one. Yeah.

Can I start you off with cocktails?

I think I need to stay sober tonight.

But you guys go ahead.

I'll have a Chardonnay.

I'll be right back.

I'll go with you.

I'll have a double vodka rocks.

I feel a little reckless tonight.

Fun personality, huh?

Yeah.

Unfortunately, she's got six more of them.

And for you, sir?

Whiskey, neat.

Since when do you drink hard liquor?

Since right now.

I'd order a glass of crack if it were on the menu.

Tru dat.

Why didn't you say something?

Why didn't you say something?

I was following your lead.

What lead?

The minute I saw her, I practically peed my pants.

Well then, I did follow your lead.

So-So what are we going to do now?

I don't know.

I guess we play along.

Play along?!

Are you serious?!

What am I supposed to do, Alan?

Tell the truth?

"Oh Chelsea, I almost forgot,

"your new BFF and I had a one-night stand

"and when I dumped her, she superglued my nutsack

"to my thigh and started stalking me.

"Oh, and then

"I thought maybe I was in love with her

"and followed her to England.

"And then when she came back from England,

I thought I was dying and almost asked her to marry me."

Yeah, when you put it in story form,

it really does sound bad.

So, we play along

until I can find out what Rose's angle is.

So, what, I'm supposed to date her?!

Stop flattering yourself.

This isn't about you.

It's me she's interested in.

What are you saying, I'm not good enough for her?

What are you saying,

you want that looney tune as a girlfriend?

No!

But I am currently unattached.

Now, you listen to me,

this is a blind date that goes no further.

You understand?

I got it.

She really likes him.

Swell.

I thought there was real chemistry between them.

I'm sure they have some meds in common.

But I wouldn't get your hopes up.

Why not?

She's not his type.

What do you mean?

She's pretty, smart, rich...

Okay, then, he's not her type.

This is crazy.

I know.

We just met.

Oh no, no,

no, you idiot.

Morning, Charlie.

Morning.

Should've smothered him in the crib

when I had the chance.

Boy, take one day off for a poker tournament

And you miss a whole lot around here.

You said you were sick.

I was healed. It's a miracle.

You want to catch me up?

Chelsea set Alan up on a blind date

With a girl she met at yoga class.

Well, what's he doing with Rose?

She's the girl.

Diabolical.

So Chelsea doesn't know...

Chelsea knows nothing and I want to keep it that way.

Okay.

Why is Alan playing along?

Because Alan is a horny idiot.

And horny idiots are perfectly willing

to have sex with crazy girls.

Yeah, I know. But I've grown.

Charlie, did you see?

Yeah, I saw.

Told you they'd hit it off.

Didn't I tell you?

You told me.

I'm a little worried they're moving so fast.

Yeah, that's the worrisome part.

Berta, have you met Rose yet?

Screw it, I'm going home.

Feel better!

Cut it out!

Stop it.

Hello.

Sit down.

Um, you know I have company.

Yes, I know you have company, now, sit down!

Okay.

'Sup?

Explain it to me, Alan.

Help me understand.

You mean Rose?

No, I mean the internal combustion engine!

Yes, Rose!

Uh, well, we, uh, we started talking

On the ride home last night, and we really hit it off.

She has changed, Charlie.

Changed?!

She was stalking my fiance.

Ah, ah, well, actually, she explained all that.

#NAME?

What did she say?

Uh, well, um...

Okay, I don't remember all the details

'cause she was tweaking my nipples at the time.

Oh... Hi, Charlie.

All right, Rose, what are you up to?

What do you mean?

I'm telling you right now,

I love Chelsea and if you mess things up with us,

I will never forgive you.

Wow.

What did I ever do to deserve that?

You're kidding, right?

Yeah.

So, once again,

What are you up to?

Okay, at first, I was just doing

A little light recon on Chelsea

To make sure you weren't dating a whack job.

You thought Chelsea might be...

Go on.

Well, good news, she's not.

She's got a cousin who's a truck stop hooker

And her mom's an honorary Kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan,

but Chelsea is clean as a whistle.

Kleagle?

According to Wikipedia it's below Grand Dragon

And above Exalted Cyclops.

Sure, whatever.

What's the deal with the lunch lady here?

Alan?

Well, that was Chelsea's idea, not mine.

#NAME?

I'm sorry, sweetie,

But I thought a double date with Charlie and his fiance

Might be a little awkward.

A little awkward?

When I saw you sitting there,

My sphincter slammed shut so quickly,

You could've used it as a cigar cutter!

Yeah, you should've seen your face.

Anyway, it all worked out for the best.

Last night, I saw a side of your brother

That I've never seen before.

What side?

He's only got the two.

Oh, no, here he comes and "Oh good, he's leaving."

Look, Charlie, this has nothing to do

With you and Chelsea.

This has nothing to do with you and Rose.

The fact is, we really like each other

Snd we want to keep seeing each other.

And we'd really like your blessing.

So, you actually want to be with him?

I do.

And you believe she's got no ulterior motive whatsoever?

I do.

Fine.

I now pronounce you fruit basket and nutcase.

May God have mercy on your souls.

Yay!

Uh, I don't think that was really a blessing, Rose.

It doesn't matter.

So what are we doing this afternoon?

Oh, uh, gee, I gotta pick up Jake.

Um, I promised him I'd take him to the movies.

You know, a little father-son time.

Oh, that's sweet.

Well, just call me when you want to get together again.

Sure, or you can call me.

Okay.

Hello?

Oh, Jake, thank God.

Uh, nothing.

Wait, hang on, I got another call.

Hello?

Yes, Rose, this is my number.

So how did you like the movie?

It was an insult to my intelligence.

Really?

Everybody knows zombies can't ride motorcycles.

Yeah, that bumped me, too.

And why would they wear helmets?

They're dead.

Another good point.

I don't know who they're

making movies for these days.

Fine, next time, you pick.

Anyway, there's something I want to talk to you about.

Oh, come on, it was one fart during the previews

and everybody laughed.

No, no, not that.

Uh, I just want you to know

that I've been dating somebody

and you might be meeting her soon.

Oh, okay, good.

So, you have no problem with that?

Not at all; you should have a girlfriend.

You think so?

Yeah, the model car stuff is starting to freak me out.

I mean, seriously.

You're a grown man.

What the hell?

You didn't call me!

- Hi, Rose.  -Hi, Jack.

So, tell me about your new girlfriend.

I'm so glad you forgave me for my little outburst in the car.

Well, you have a very compelling way of apologizing.

But we need to have a little talk about boundaries.

It was just my pinky, Alan.

No, no, that was fun.

Is it about me following you and Jake

into the movie theater?

You followed us into the movie theater?!

No...

Look, Rose, I really like you

but you've got to realize

that people need their space.

And you need to respect that.

All right.

So, we're clear on that?

Yes. I'm sorry.

It won't happen again.

Hm. Good.

Well, good night.

Good night.

Boy, this is an Alan Harper I haven't seen before.

Forceful, confident...

Thank you.

I don't like him very much.

Morning, Charlie.

Morning, Rose.

Alan needs his space.

I'm gonna give it to him.

#NAME?

Will do.

Oh, I got a bad feeling.

Alan?

Yeah?

You okay?

Been better.

I'm coming in.

#NAME?

Impressive.

It's not me.

No kidding.

What is it?

Oh, Burt Reynolds' Trans Am from Smokey and the Bandit.

Yep.

Would you care to explain why it's parked

in your handicapped spot?

Not parked.

Glued.

Ah.

Rose?

Rose.

Told ya. You did.

But did you listen? Nope.

Okay.

Happy motoring.

 Here in my car, I feel safest of all

 Scooby Dooby Doo

 Where are you?

 We got some work to do now

 Scooby Scooby Doo

 Where are you?

 We need some help from you now...

I feel bad it didn't work out with Alan and Rose.

Me, too.

Terrible.

The problem is they jumped into bed too fast.

The problem is he doesn't keep his glue solvent

in his night stand.

What's that mean?

Another way of saying what you said.

Ow!

What's wrong with him?

Little car accident.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh,come on,Chelsea.

Is this about money?

'Cause I'd be happy to pay
the lease on your apartment.

It's not about money,you ass.

I just think it's ridiculous that
we're engaged and not living together.

Well,excuse me for being old-fashioned, I'm
just not comfortable with us living in sin.

So you think we should stop having sex?

No,no,no,it's not the sin I
object to, it's the living in it.

Charlie,there is no reason for me to renew the
lease on my apartment when I'm here every night.

And I love having you
here every night...

You going to eat your pickle?

Yes,I'm going to eat my pickle.

But you're almost done with your sandwich,
and your pickle's just sitting there.

I like to eat it last.

How very European of you.

- Here's another pickle.
- Shut up.

Oh,you are just so full of it!

Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't be living here.

I can give you several.

This ought to be good.

Go ahead.

- Oh,you mean right now?
- Dance,monkey,dance.

Okay. Well,there's the safety issue.

You should keep your apartment for the same reason
that airplanes are equipped with oxygen masks,

and cruise ships have life rafts.

You know,if theTitanic had enough life rafts,
Leonardo and Kate would've lived happily ever after.

Oops.

You're comparing our
relationship to theTitanic?

Rope-a-dope,rope-a-dope.

No,no,no, of course not.

But P.S.,that was a very romantic movie.
Thanks for making me watch it again.

He's still swinging.
The kid's got heart.

Where are you going?

- Home!
- See?

You just proved my point.

Where would you go right now if
you didn't have your own apartment?

I suppose you all
enjoyed listening to that.

- Beg pardon?
- I enjoyed it.

<b>Two and a half men
06x22
** Sir Lancelot's Litter Box **</b>

Can't sleep,huh?

No.

This Chelsea-moving-in
thing is really bugging me.

Why are you up?

Well,I realized you were out here drinking yourself
into a miserable stupor over this whole situation and...

I just want to be a part of that.

Thanks.

I hate to say it, but I
think Chelsea might be right.

You don't hate to say it.

Oh,did I say I hate to say it?

I meant I can't wait to say it.

But I did admire how you ferociously
defended an unwinnable position

by comparing your
relationship to theTitanic.

That was beautiful.

Oh,come on, who remembers the
names of boats that don't sink?

Sure,sure. I couldn't give you a
zeppelin other than theHindenburg.

Still,it was not your finest moment.

There was a time it would've worked.

Yeah,back when you were
dating silicone simpletons.

Unfortunately,Chelsea is
too smart for your crap.

Yeah.

And there's not an ounce
of silicone in those babies.

Shoot. I owe Berta five bucks.

Uh,b-but more to the point, why are
you so afraid to have her move in?

I'm not afraid of her
moving in,that's easy.

Moving her out's the bitch.

So,you're already assuming
you're going to break up?

Oh,come on, what evidence is there to
suggest that it'll end any other way?

Well,I think she's capable
of a long-term commitment.

And you,you could... change.

You don't believe that.

No,I was just trying to be supportive.

Well,you're not doing a very good job.

I'm not trying very hard.

Let me ask you a question.

What did you think was gonna happen
when you and Chelsea got married?

Honestly,I never thought that far ahead.

I figured we could stretch the engagement thing
out for a couple of years, and by then,who knows.

Maybe I'd die, maybe she'd get fat.

Well,kudos to you for not
bringing that up in the argument.

It wasn't easy.

You know what you have to do,don't you?

I don'thaveto do anything,Alan.

If not living together
is a deal breaker,

then she's free to break off the
engagement and go on her merry way.

She most certainly is.

So you know what you have to do.

Yes,I know what I have to do.

Are you done torturing me?

Yeah,almost.

I'm the king of the world!

Okay,now I'm done.

Here.

What's this?

Alan's house key.

Why?

'Cause I want you to move in, and I
didn't have time to make a new one.

Plus,he kind of pissed
me off last night.

- You want me to move in?
- Yes.

I thought about it, and you were right.

Which is not to say
I was wrong, but,uh...

Okay,I was wrong.

You're sure you want me to move in?

Absolutely not.

But I figure what the hell.

I mean,it's gonna happen
sooner or later,right?

Oh,shut up.

Come on in,I'll make some coffee.

What's all this?

Let's just say I had faith in you.

Those go upstairs in the master bedroom.

Careful, they're fragile.

Okay,you and me need to talk.

I know. I know. You
didn't sign up for this.

You work for me,not for her, and it's bad enough
you have to put up with Zippy and the chimp.

No. I like her better than you,so
from now on I'm working for her.

What?

You need something,you ask
her, she talks to me,we decide.

I don't get a vote?

Yeah,you get a vote.
One vote out of three.

Good luck with that.

Oh,boy.

You like it?

Oh,boy!

Don't the colors just
liven the place up?

Well...

Oh,boy!

Come on,I want to show you
what I did in the bathroom.

Oh,boy.

What do you think?

I don't know.

I have this sudden urge
to pee sitting down.

You like the new towels?

I guess.

What was wrong with the old ones?

They didn't match my shower curtain.

What was wrong withmyshower curtain?

Didn't match your towels.

Maybe that's how I tell them apart.

Oh,oh, please tell me that's
one of those Zen sand gardens.

You know very well that's
Sir Lancelot's litter box.

You brought the cat?

Of course I brought the cat. What
did you think I was gonna do with him?

I don't know. Return him to the wild?

You're being ridiculous.

Is it ridiculous to want the
turds in my bathroom to be human?

Fine,we'll put it in the laundry room.

Near my clean clothes? Forget it.

So where am I supposed to put it?

Oh,I don't think you really want
me to tell you where to put it.

I'm just saying it's too much!

Pillows,towels,shower curtains,cat crap!

I don't like it, I don't
need it, I don't want it!

What do you want me to
do,Charlie? You want me to leave?

No,no,no! You just got here! I'll leave!

It'll make more room for
you and Sir Crapsalot!

Charlie!

- Get a good earful?
- No.

I did. And I don't appreciate
being called Sir Crapsalot.

Oh,good. For some reason,
I can't find my house key.

I hope you're happy with yourself.

Why would I start now?

How'd you find me?

Wasn't hard.

When you're not volunteering to read
stories to the elderly or feed the homeless,

you're usually here.

Sea breeze, extra pineapple.

I'm not cut out for this
living together stuff,Alan.

I mean,I tried,I really tried.

That's true. You gave it a whole,uh...

hour and 20 minutes.

Hey,now Berta owesmefive bucks.

Charlie,it's not really that
difficult to live with a woman.

Says the man who's
been thrown out twice.

I didn't say it wasn't hard for them.

Did you see the salt and pepper
shakers Chelsea put in the kitchen?

No.

They're like these foot-high ceramic roosters
with little S and P holes in their beaks.

Cute. I think I saw those in
the Williams-Sonoma catalog.

What am I freaking out about?

A woman's been living
with me for six years.

Cheap shot. Canned pineapple?

It's not just the salt shakers.

It's the fancy pillows on the bed,
the fruity towels in the bathroom,

and then there's the
clothes and the shoes.

Oh,my God,the shoes. She's
got almost as many as I do!

And lest we forget, she brought her
big,fat, pooping cat to live with us.

As opposed to what,
having it put to sleep?

I suggested letting it go.
I didn't even think of that.

The cat aside,you do know it was
wrong to storm out the way you did.

Of course I know. I'm
an ass,not an idiot.

One does not preclude the other.

You realize this has nothing to do with the
cat or the towels or the pillows,don't you?

Tell you what. Here's 20 bucks.

Don't tell me what it's really about.

Boy, you're putting me in
a tough spot here,Charlie.

- 40.
- Good night.

Nah,I care too much
about you two kids. Here.

Now,the reason you panicked is that...

This is just 20.

Is it? My mistake.

The reason you panicked and ran away is that
you recognize that the old Charlie is dying.

But what you have to understand is, he has
to die in order for a new Charlie to be born.

Well,that makes sense.

- Let me ask you a question.
- Of course.

Does the new Charlie
still have the old brother?

Absolutely,and he's here for you.

Man,I can't catch a break.

So,how pissed off was
Chelsea when I left?

It was pretty bad at first.

Did you really suggest that she do something
anatomically impossible with the kitty litter box?

I didn't suggest anything.

She may have inferred.

Well,regardless,I think I may have been
able to smooth it over for you a little bit.

Really? What'd you say?

Uh,I said you had the emotional maturity of a
nine year-old,and that she had to make allowances.

That's good. That's
good. Make it her fault.

So now all you have to do is go home,

admit that you're a frightened little man who
doesn't deserve her love, and beg for her forgiveness.

Groveling comes easy for you,doesn't it?

Not at first. I didn't really hit
my stride till my second marriage.

Oh,by the way,have you
seen my house key anywhere?

Nope.

Oh,Chelsea,I was such a fool.

Thank God my brother
talked some sense into me.

Oh,Charlie, I love your brother.

He's so smart and masculine, and yet,his
femine side makes him sensitive and intuitive.

You're right. I only tease
him 'cause I'm jealous.

And secretly gay.

Oh,hello.

Don't worry.

This ain't the most embarrassing
thing I ever walked in on you doing.

Oh,yeah. Thanks for not
making a big thing about that.

Right back at ya.

You know, I really should cut
down on the talking to myself.

Yes,you should. It's
getting a little weird.

Son of a bitch!

Can I say I'm sorry again,
or are you sick of it?

Say it again. Let's see.

I'm sorry.

Nope. Still fun.

And?

And... I'm a big, stupid jerk.

And?

And I'd really like to go upstairs
and finish this apology with my mouth.

Charlie,a moment?

Not now,Alan.

Uh,yeah,well, there's a bit of a situation,
and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

I'd better talk to him.

He's about to go full fruit fly.

What is your problem?

Well,I noticed you put a
lot of stuff in my room,

and I was wondering how
long it was gonna stay there.

I've been wondering the
same thing about you.

Come on,Charlie.

How am I supposed to live in that room if you
and Chelsea are gonna use it as a walk-in closet?

Tell you what.

I'll give you a break on the rent.

- I haven't been paying rent.
- There it is!

Fine. I'll manage somehow.

- Alan,wait.
- What?

- I need you to pull your car out of the garage.
- Why?

You don't expect Chelsea to
park on the street,do you?

So,I have to park on the street?

You don't have to.

You can park it at your place.

- I don't have a place.
- There it is!

You can leave your clicker
on the coffee table.

Wait,wait,Charlie, if
I don't have a clicker,

and I don't have a house key,
how am I supposed to get in?

There it is!

I don't have to pee.

I don't have to pee.

Damn it,I have to pee.

Son of a bitch.

Oh,ski poles!

Oh,good. A litter box.

This is delicious.

Sure is.

Glad you like it. There's plenty more.

Jake,would you pass me the chicken?

It's fish,Dad.

Hope you're not
allergic to Sir Lancelot.

I'll be fine as long as he
doesn't sleep on my face again.

He is a snuggler,isn't he?

Yeah. By the way,do you know if
anybody rented your old apartment yet?

Actually,somebody just scooped it up.

Why? Are you thinking of moving out?

Well,obviously,there's not
a lot of room for me here.

What's a place like that go for?

$1,800 a month.

On the other hand, it's
nice to be close to family.

Well,you got no shame at all,do you?

I assume that's a rhetorical question.

Where's Uncle Charlie?

Said he had some sort of meeting.

That means poker or strip club.

I'm sure it's poker.

Ooh,pizza.

Hey,Gordon,small world.

Hey,Mr. Harper. What are you doing here?

Oh,I just rented this place.

Decided I need a weekend getaway.

From Malibu?

You'd be surprised. It
gets crowded sometimes.

Okay.

What happened to that beautiful
woman that used to lived here?

She lives with me in
Malibu. We're engaged.

- And you're hanging out here all alone?
- Yup.

- You know what you are, Mr. Harper?
- What?

A genius.

- Thanks,Gordon. Good night.
- Good night.

It's nice when someone gets you.

.......... ********** ..........

* Men. *

And how are you
this morning, Danny?

Well, I didn't sleep
very well last night, Alan.

I had nightmares.

Nightmares. Nightmares.

I dreamed I ate
a five-pound marshmallow.

A five-pound
marshmallow?

Yeah, and when I woke up,
my pillow was gone.

Pillow was gone.

Pillow. T-Tillow.

Pil... tillow. Pftil...

Alan?

Yeah?

You're starting to scare
the crap out of me.

Oh, oh, this?

This is, uh,
just a new hobby.

Charlie, say hello
to Danny O'Day.

Howdy-do, Charlie.

That's not a hobby.
That's a cry for help.

Oh, come on, Charlie,
play along.

So, Charlie, how did you
sleep last night?

With a woman, Alan.

Something you need to do
before this gets out of hand.

Wow.

He's got a stick
where I've got your hand.

Did you ask him
if he wants to go
to the movies with us?

No.
Why not?

Because he's a ticking time bomb
and we don't want to be

in the car with him
when he goes off.

Come on,
he's breaking my heart.

Staying home all alone
on a Friday night.

Don't worry.

You know how they say
you can be alone

but not lonely?
Yeah.

Well, Alan's kind
of the opposite.

He's always lonely
but he's never alone.

He's going through a tough time.

Your brother should
be surrounded

by friends and family.

My brother should be surrounded
by a SWAT team.

Please? For me?

Chelsea, we agreed that you only
get one of those a month.

Are you sure you want
to waste it on Alan?

Thanks for letting me
tag along with you.

This is really sweet.

We're thrilled
you could join us.

Right, Charlie?

Yippee skippy.

So have we picked a movie yet?

Nope. Would you
like to see

La Poubelle et le Fromage
at the Nuart?

Would I?

Who you calling
"wood eye"?

Big ears.

Now, Danny,
watch your mouth.

Why? Yours is the one
that's moving.

(Chelsea and Alan laugh)

Yippee skippy.

If she goes back to him
after what he's done,

I will never
forgive her.

She loves him.

What choice
does she have?

Oh, she can return
to her husband,
the cheese maker.

Listen, I'm going
to hit the head.

Let me know if any
kind of a plot
ever kicks in.

He's not coming
back, is he?

They sell beer
in the lobby?
Yes.

No.

for a Saturday morning.

ALAN:
Chelsea, it's 7:30.

We got to get
a move on.

Oh, God, that's right.
I forgot.

Give me a few minutes
to get dressed.

No problem.
I'll wait for
you downstairs.

What's going on?

Your brother and I are going
to the farmers market.

Since when?

We made plans
last night.

Last night when?

In the movie theater,

while you were sitting
in the lobby drinking.

Well, I wasn't going to go
sit in the car

with that scary dummy.

I like mustard,

and pickles,

and ketchup,

and mayonnaise.

Mayonnaise.

Mayonnaise.

You and me need to talk.

Howdy-do, Charlie.

Get that ugly thing
out of my face.

That's what she said.

Oh, Danny.

Danny, you're horrible.

My hand to God, Alan,

I will wrap
that dummy with meat

and throw him in the ocean.

Don't forget
the mayonnaise.

Ow!

I'm okay.

Why are you taking Chelsea
to that farmers thing?

Is there a problem?

Yeah, there's a problem!

You're ruining my Saturday.

I'm sorry.
Did you have plans for the day?

Damn right I had plans.

First, I was going
to have sex with Chelsea.

And then...

Well, then I was going
to go back to sleep.

Well, you can still
go back to sleep.

Yeah, but without sex,
it's a restless sleep.

Fine, fine,
I'll just go by myself.

No, no,
if you go without her now,

then I'm the bad guy.
So what do you want me to do?

In the future,
I want you to try to be

more sensitive and considerate
to other people's needs.

Okay.

Thank you.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to join Chelsea

in the shower and try
to knock out a quick one.

Oh, Danny...

Sometimes he can
be such a pig.

Well, you know what
happens to pigs.

They get slaught...

Danny, don't say it.

Don't even think it.

...ered.

What are you looking at?

Nothin'.

Oh, hey! Hey.

What are you doing here?

I thought you were
spending the weekend

with your mom and Herb.

Yeah, I was supposed to,
but Mom's got

all those pregnancy
hormones going.

What did you do?

One little fat joke.

Took it badly, eh?

Well, here I am.

Where's Dad?

He went out
with Chelsea.

You mean like a date?

No, no, not a date.

Good, 'cause
that'd be weird.

Yeah.

I saw something like that
on Jerry Springer once.

Two brothers, one girl--
it got ugly.

I'm sure it did.

So what's Dad's dummy
doing here?

He pissed off his mother.

Oh.

Hey, I did that, too.

* Men. *

Okay, please take this
kettle corn away from me.

I can feel it going
right to my behind.

Oh, stop it.

I wish my tush
was as small as yours.

Okay, first of all,
you have a perfect heinie.

And secondly, if you're
worried about firmness,

the secret is
isometric glute crunches.

Really?
Yeah, you can do
them anywhere, anytime.

I'm doing them
right now. See?

Mailbox open, mailbox closed.

Mailbox open,

mailbox closed.

Come on, try it with me.

BOTH:
Mailbox open, mailbox closed.

Mailbox open,

mailbox closed.

Mailbox open, mailbox...

You know, just once
I'd like to walk in this room

and not be freaked out.

Alan was just showing
me his butt exercises.

Have him show you the one where
he sticks his head up there.

That's my favorite.

Stop it.

Now, go away,
we're making dinner.

It's kind of like a Kegel
exercise, isn't it?
Exactly.

Except with the tush,
not the hoo-ha.

What up, homes?

What are you doing?

Enjoying the sunset,
waiting on dinner.

You're staying for dinner?

I wasn't gonna,

but your lovely fianc?
and her new gal pal insisted.

Yeah, I've got to put
a stop to that.

What are you, nuts?

This is the perfect
setup for you.

How do you figure?

Do you like
to go shopping?

No.
Zippy does.

Do you like to watch
chick flicks?

No.

Zippy does.

Do you like
to talk for hours
about your feelings?

No.

Zippy do.

Oh, right.

He digs the trench,
you lay the pipe.

How could I not see this?

Alan's not the competition.
He's her gay friend.

There you go.
Your life is perfect.

It is, isn't it?

Yeah. Now, be an
angel and get me
another beer.

Absolutely.

(door opens)

(door closes)

Jiminy, I'm drunk.

* Men. *

(TV playing)

Oh, I hate
to do this to you.

Uh, but using the existing "S"
in the top row,

with R-E before it

and I-Z-I-N-G after it,

hitting two triple word scores,

and it's a bingo.

"Resizing."

120 points.

Oh, my God.

You play for
blood, don't you?

Let me tell you something,
Chelsea.

When it comes to Scrabble,

nice guys finish
with a rack full of tiles.

(turns off TV)

(yawns)

CHELSEA:
What do you mean
it's not a word?

ALAN:
I mean it's not a
word. Try again.

Hmm.

Charlie horny.

Another glass of wine?

I would love one.

(giggles) Now?

But Alan and I are
playing Scrabble.

(chuckling):
Well, I'm playing Scrabble.

I don't know whatshe'sdoing.

I'm improving,
is what I'm doing.

I want a rematch.

Good night, Alan.

But I just poured wine.

Oh, thanks.

And thanks for being such
a good friend to Chelsea.

You don't have
to thank me.

I like her, and we've got
a lot in common.

Yeah, whatever--
just keep it up,

and I'll try
to do the same.

Kind of ruined the night.

He's using you.

(chuckling)

I know, but what
am I going to do?

You could... kill him.

Now, Danny,
I-I could never do that.

Don't worry, Alan.

I can do it for you.

Morning.
Morning.

Hope you're hungry--
I made pancakes.

Oh, I'm starving.
Can I help?

Uh, sure, slice
up some bananas

and warm up the syrup.

I'm on it.

Sleep well?

Yeah.

I mean, when your brother
finally let me go to sleep.

(forced chuckling)

Can I tell you a little secret?

Sure.

He's the best lover
I've ever had.

Oh, isn't that nice.

Yeah, it's great,

but sometimes he doesn't know
when to quit.

Have you tried pepper spray?

No.

But every once in a while,
I actually have

to give him a little smack
on the top of his head.

Yeah, I have the same problem
with Jake

when he eats spaghetti.

I mean, obviously not
the same problem.

Jake's head is
usually over here.

Don't get me wrong.

I'm not complaining,
but it can be exhausting.

I can imagine.

Have you given Charlie
enough attaboys?

Attaboys?

You know,
like when you're training a dog.

If you don't give them
a lot of hugs

and a treat every now and then,
they're gonna chew up your rug.

I mean, not your rug.

Hey, how are those
bananas coming?

Morning.

Morning.
How'd you sleep?

Good.

When you finally let me.
Hush.

Alan's making pancakes.

Can I pour you
some coffee?

I would love that.

Good morning,
Mrs. Butterworth.

(forced chuckling)

Ooh.

Lakers-Spurs today.

Charlie, you promised we'd go
to the Van Gogh exhibit.

I did?

Yes.

Wow, I don't remember that.

You got to quit hitting me
on the head so much.

Yeah, I have heard that exhibit
is supposed to be terrific.

I've been dying
to see it.

Really?

Then why don't we all go?

I can't. I promised Jake
we'd do something.

Bring him along.

What 14-year-old boy
doesn't love a fine art museum?

I think
that's a great idea, Alan.

You and Jake come with us.

Well, if you don't think
we'd be intruding.

No. No, not at all.

Okay, great.

Well, save me some pancakes.

I'm going to jump
in the shower and get ready.

Hurry! I want to get to the
museum before it's too crowded.

All right,
here's the deal.

You're gonna have to go
to the museum without me.

Why?

I am about

to get an acute case
of intestinal distress.

What?
You know...

the flapjack two-step.

But there's nothing wrong
with my pancakes.

No, they're delightful.

But the Lakers are playing
the Spurs,

and I'm not gonna miss it.

So what? So you're just gonna
use me to entertain your fianc?

while you stay home
and watch a basketball game?

Good. We're on the same page.

Hey, did you ever stop to think

that maybe
I've got plans of my own?

That I've got a life?

That I'm not always
at your beck and call?

No.

* Men. *

(sportscast playing)

You know, Berta, I thought

when Alan moved in here
I was being punished.

You and me both.

But come to find out,
it was a blessing.

With him in my life,
I think

I can actually make my
relationship with Chelsea work.

So you're really gonna go
through with this marriage?

Absolutely. I'm ready
for the whole shebang.

Kids, too?

Well, it's certainly
in the cards.

Of course, I'd have
to talk it over

with Chelsea
and Alan first.

Wow, marriage and kids.

I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

What can I say, Berta?

He c me.

(chuckles)

* Men. *

(cell phone chimes)

One second.

(laughs)

He's hilarious.

Who?

Your brother.

L-O-L.

(cell phone chimes)

Let me just tell him
we'll talk tomorrow.

(laughing)

He is out of control.

What now?

Hang on.

"Don't let him
chew up the rug."

What does that mean?

Nothing.

Why would I
chew up a rug?

Not a rug, my...
never mind.

Okay, where were we?

We were just about...

(cell phone chimes)

I'm sure he just wants
to say "good night."

(cell phone chimes)

(cell phone chimes)

(cell phone chimes)

I'm sorry. Let me just
make sure he's okay.

Is he okay?

Yeah.

Good, good.

Hey, I'm thirsty.
Are you thirsty?

No.
Be right back.

Hurry.

Don't worry.

This won't take but a minute.

Oh, Charlie...

Your penis is no match
for my technology.

Okay.

I know what you're doing,
now quit it.

What I'm doing?

Whatever do you mean?

You're text-blocking me.

Hey, I can't help it

if Chelsea finds me
witty and urbane.

Keep it up and she's going
to find you bloody and homeless.

You don't scare me, Charlie.

You need me to keep
Chelsea off your back.

That may be true,
but I don't need

him!

Wait, just let
him go, Charlie.

This is just between you and me.

Not anymore.

Don't you dare hurt him!

Well, now,
that's entirely up to you.

His tiny, wooden head
is in your hands.

Charlie?

ALAN:
Danny!
(thudding)

ALAN: Just let him go!
CHARLIE: No!

Charlie?

(both grunting)

What the hell are you doing?

Nothing.

Nothing.

Nothing.

CHELSEA:
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

That's no way for
a grown man to behave!

CHARLIE:
He started it!

CHELSEA: I don't care
who started it!

You're the older brother.

You set the example.
Really?

Then maybe I
should move out...

Boy, they're really
going at it.

Yeah. I'm glad
we never fight.

Me, too, Danny.

'Cause you don't ever
want to make me angry.

I-I-I know, Danny.

Seriously.

Fade in.

Exterior-- Night.

A dark, desolate prairie.

A lone cowboy sits on a
sturdy horse, gazing up at the moon.

Suddenly, a flash of
light appears in the sky

And a burning meteor
plummets to the Earth.

Fade in. Exterior--
Night.

New York City, Hell's Kitchen.

A lone cop sits in a
patrol car, gazing up at the moon.

Suddenly, a flash of
light appears in the sky

And a flaming meteor
plummets to the Earth.

All right. Now we're cooking.

- Alan?
- Mia?

- I thought that was you
- What a nice surprise

Didn't you move back to New
York with your husband?

We did but then we split
up. Then I came back here.

O Im sorry to hear that.

I mean, not that you moved back here,
but that it didn't work out.

So how is Charlie doing?

O he is fine Actually he is engaged.

- You're kidding?
- No, no. She moved in and everything.

- Good for him. So where a you living now?
- What do you mean?

You know. Since Charlie's
fiancé moved in I assumed...

You look great Alan.

Thank you. You too.

- Please give Charlie my best.
- Will do.

- Bye bye
- Bye

Fade in.
Interior, Coffee shop. Night.

An unconventionally handsome man
pounds away at his lonely laptop,

Writing the summer blockbuster that will lift him
from poverty and put him in a home of his own.

A beautiful woman crosses
to him. Their eyes meet.

Suddenly, a flash of
light appears in the sky

And a burning meteor
plummets to the Earth.

So, when do you think you'll be home?

But I was looking
forward having dinner with you.

Alright see you later.

Yeah. Love you too.

Love you too.

- Alan?
- Yeah.

Smack your kid for me.

Should we really risk more brain damage?

Thanks for sticking up for me, Dad.

You'll never guess who I ran into.

- Kobe Bryant?
- No.

- Lauren Conrad?
- No.

- Sean "P.Diddy" Combs?
- What is wrong with you?

No, I ran into Mia at the coffee shop.

You're kidding.

No, uh, apparently, she's
single again and, uh, living in L.A.

What's wrong with you?

So... Mia. How did she look?

Oh, better than ever.

Damn.

What did she say?

Uh, she said to give you her best.

- That's it?
- Pretty much.

- How did she say it?
- What do you mean?

I mean, was it
perfunctory or was there subtext?

Perfunctory.

That could be my rap
name. MC Perfunctory.

I don't know.

But I-I mentioned that you were
engaged, and, uh, she seemed happy for you.

You told her I was engaged? Why
the hell would you do that?

Because you are, in fact, engaged.

And she seemed happy about that?

Yeah, she said, "Good for him."

- How did she say it?
- Was it perfunctory?

Or were there subtitles?

I'm leaving.

And yet the memory of him lingers on.

- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Yeah?

Love you.

To think I fought for shared custody.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so... so back to Mia.

Oh, don't tell me you're still
carrying a torch for her.

No, I'm not carrying a torch for her.

Why, do you think she's
carrying a torch for me?

Charlie, you are
engaged to a wonderful woman.

Just forget about Mia.

I had forgotten about her.

I had forgotten
about her face... her eyes...

Her lips, her legs. Oh, God, those legs.

You're the one who brought her up.

Sorry. Look, I'm the
last one to tell you

You can't have feelings
for an old girlfriend.

I mean, I myself still have very
strong feelings for Melissa.

Who's Melissa?

My receptionist.

Oh, right. The one that caught
you in bed with her mom.

Uh, you're leaving out a lot
of extenuating circumstances, but...

Yes, she caught me rubbing
against her mother.

And you want to compare that freak
show to what Mia and I had?

I almost married her.

All I'm saying is, you can acknowledge
your feelings for Mia

While still moving forward with Chelsea.

That's exactly what I intend to do.

- Good.
- It is good.

You're thinking about sex
with Mia, aren't you?

You're thinking about
sex with Melissa, aren't you?

Trying to, but her mom keeps popping in.

Okay, okay. I'm just
going to come out and say it.

Baseball was better with steroids.

I mean, this guy is leading
the league with 11 home runs.

Back in Sammy Sosa's
day, that was a slow weekend.

Call me crazy, but...

I think people would pay real money to
see a meat-Covered robot hit a ball 750 feet.

Okay, well... Sports center is over.

Time for sex.

Charlie, please, this
report's due tomorrow.

All right.

I guess our relationship is getting to that
mature, evolved stage they talk about.

- Guess so.
- Terrific.

I hope I die soon.

- What?
- Love you.

Remember when you used to close
the door and tried to hit the porcelain

So I didn't have to hear you pee?

Yeah, way back when we used to
have sex after Sports center.

Hello? Uh, hang on.

Charlie, there's a
woman named Mia on the phone.

- Should I take a message?
- No, no, no.

Hello.

Oh, hey, Mia. What a surprise.

Yeah, Alan mentioned he ran into you.

Old friend.

Yes, yes, you heard correctly.

I am engaged. Thank you.

Yes, that was her.

Oh, she's terrific.

And how are you?

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Well, there's plenty more fish in the s.

And I'm sure you'll get out there in that
old dating pond and catch something.

You know, a-A-A fish,
not a disease.

Anyway, thanks for
the good wishes. Bye-Bye.

Okay, well, good night.

- Old friend, huh?
- Yeah.

She heard I was engaged
and wanted to congratulate me.

Sweet kid.

Is this the woman you almost married
in Vegas a few years ago?

- Charlie?
- I'm thinking.

Charlie.

- Who told you about that?
- Your brother.

Oh, really?

Did he tell you his last
girlfriend caught him in bed with her mother?

Yes, he did.

What a dirtbag, huh?

So, were you ever
going to tell me about Mia?

What's the point?

Have you told me about
every guy you've ever been with?

Actually, I have.

My boyfriend in high school, two guys
in college and the man I married.

That's it--
Four?

Back in your day, that was
a slow weekend, right?

It's not a competition, Chels.

So, why do you think this Mia is calling
you in the middle of the night?

Honey, it was perfectly innocent.

She just called to
congratulate me on our engagement.

No, she didn't. She
called to see if you're happy.

She wants to know if you're
still available.

Really, you think so?

I mean... Really, you think so?

Yes, I think so.

The question is: Are you happy?
Are you available?

Oh, come on, Chels. What
kind of question is that?

No, I'm not available,
and I'm certainly not happy.

- You know what I mean.
- I hope so.

Yep. I'm a happy and lucky man.

Happy, happy, happy.

Lucky, lucky, lucky.

And wet.

I'm kind of wet.

What you writing?

- A screenplay.
- Cool.

Hey, I got a great idea for
a movie if you want it.

Thanks--
I'm okay.

What is it?

Okay. So there's this
guy who on the highway

Where he hits like a moose or something.

And he loses control of his car and crashes
into a truck full of toxic waste.

And when he wakes up in the
hospital, he's part car and part animal.

Car-nimal.

Thanks, but think
I'll stick with my idea.

- Fine-- What's your
idea? - You really interested?

Sure.

Well, it's, uh... it's about a man,
uh, who's at a crossroads in his life, uh,

Coming to terms with,
uh, loss and... and mortality.

- You know what you could call it?
- What?

Boring.

Thank you.

Rated G... A-Y.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Herb.

I'm here to pick up Jake.

Oh, come on in.

Jake, time to get
the hell out of my house!

So, how's it going?

Oh, pretty good.
Baby's coming any day now.

Judith's got that glow of motherhood.

Gangway, I gotta freakin' pee again.

Yeah, she's radiant.

Hey, Herb. Jake's
just finishing breakfast.

Or he could be starting
lunch. It's a fine line.

Well, he is a growing boy.

He's a growing pain in my ass.

He says that with love.

No, I say it with a
dull, throbbing pain in my ass.

My water just broke.

Are you sure?

Yes, I'm sure.

I ain't cleaning that up.

Boy, this brings back memories, huh?

Shut up.

Slipping in Judith's amniotic fluid.

Guess this'll be pretty funny someday.

It's pretty funny right now, Herb.

Hello? A little help here!

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Hold your horses, I'm...

- Dr. Harper?
- Melissa, what are you doing here?

I work here.

I had to find
another job after... You know.

For the last time, I did
not have sex with your mother!

Excuse me, I'm having a baby here!

Yeah, and I think I broke my ankle.

- Quit whining, Herb!
- Her doctor's on his way.

The contractions are about
eight minutes apart.

Oh, well, let's get you to prenatal.

I'll sign you in and have an
orderly take you upstairs.

No. No, No, no. I'm the
father. I'll do it.

Bad idea, Herb.

I'm here, Judith. Everything's okay.

God.

My arm!

I'm coming, Judith!

Stay down, champ. It's not your night.

Oh, my freaking God!

Now, you're not breathing. You
got to remember to breathe.

Good, good, good. Okay.

Now, you're only two minutes
apart. So we're in the homestretch here.

Great.

Boy...

It seems like just yesterday
we were at this same hospital

Waiting for little Jake to arrive.

I guess after pushing
out his enormous head

This one will feel like
spitting a watermelon seed.

So anyway, I really love my fiancée,

But I can't get this other
girl out of my mind.

I mean, she told my brother
to give me her best.

And let me tell ya, her best could
curl your hair and make your ass whistle.

Is that what you're
here for? A whistling ass?

No-No, no. There's a baby and some
broken bones. Not important.

The thing is, I know
you can't expect to keep

The passion of a new
relationship going forever,

But I kind of miss it.

Maybe it's just that the grass
always looks greener, you know?

- You see this cooler?
- Yeah.

It's carrying two light beers, a
half a ham sandwich and my thumb.

So you'll excuse me if I lack

A certain degree of interest
in your romantic dilemma.

You got beer?

- Oh God! Oh, God!
- Now, focus on me.

Remember your
breathing. One, two, one, two, one...

Dr. Harper?

- Melissa.
- I miss you.

Oh, I miss you, too.

- Can we talk?
- Of course.

Alan!

You're fine. Just keep breathing.

Hey, Charlie!

Look at me. I'm half man, half machine.

Kind of like Jake's movie
idea. Car-nimal!

It's okay, dude. I'm
going to hang here for a while.

I love that guy!

What the hell did they give you?

Oh, the good stuff.

You could pull out every one of
my teeth, I wouldn't even notice.

They didn't, did they?

You're fine.

Okay, then. Guess we should get going.

You drive, okay? I'm pretty buzzed.

What about Judith?

No, let's not bring her. She's a downer.

No argument, but there is the baby.

Oh, my God... the baby!

Judith needs me. I must go to her.

I'm coming, Judith! I'm coming!

Hey, Charlie, how'd you
get here so quick?

Oh, I tried to forget you.
To hate you. But I couldn't.

Really? Most people don't
have that problem.

Beer and chips.
This is turning out okay.

Did you see where my friend went?

He went hobbling down the
hall, mumbling about some Judith.

I better go warn the villagers.

Good luck to you.

Thanks. Oh, and hey.

Good luck to you, too.

God!

Oh, there you are.

You seen Herb?

No, I haven't seen Herb!

Chips?

- No, I don't want any chips!
- Okay.

I don't think you're
supposed to have beer.

Get out of here!

No problem.

Wait! Don't leave me!

I need someone to coach me
through my contractions.

All right.

Way to go.

Judith! I'm coming!

See, I love Chelsea, but you know,
there was a time I loved Mia.

Breathe.

All right, you're fully dilated.

I think it's time to have this baby.

Okay, well... good luck.

Don't you dare leave me!

Judith, I'm here!

Whoopsie. Think I broke my nose.

Three cheers for Demerol.

-
Hip-Hip! - Hooray!

Interior--
Hospital delivery room. Day.

An unconventionally handsome man
looks down upon the baby that might be his,

But which he can never claim.

Suddenly, a flash of
light appears in the sky

And a flaming meteor
plummets to the Earth.

See, that's me holding the baby.

That's me and the doctor.

That's me, Judith and the baby.

Who's that?

Oh, that's just a guy who
got his thumb sewn back on.

I can't get over how into
this baby you are.

It was amazing. The miracle of birth.

If Judith hadn't been
there, it would've been perfect.

So you're not against maybe having
one of your own someday?

I don't see why not.

Turns out, I like babies.

And as you know, I'm a longtime
fan of intercourse.

I know. I got to get back to work.

- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Love you.

Love you, too.

- Bye, Alan.
- Bye.

- How's the screenplay coming?
- Great.

Still on page one?

Yeah, but now it really sizzles.

Hi, Charlie.

Mia.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

- So, how's Charlie doing?
- Oh, he's fine.

Uh, actually, he's engaged.

You told her I was engaged?
Why the hell would you do that?!

Charlie, there's a woman
named Mia on the phone.

I'll take it.

Hi, Charlie.

Mia.

and now

So, how are you?

- Great. How are you?
- Fine, fine.

Still engaged.

Come, sit, join us.

- Are you sure I'm not interrupting?
- No, no, of course not.

Yeah, his fiancÃ©e just left.

Oh, I'm sorry I missed her.

Oh, I bet she's still out in
the parking lot. I'll go get her.

So...

what's going on with you
these days? You still dancing?

Not so much. I'm a little
old for ballet now.

Oh, that can't be right.
You look great.

Young and vibrant and...

taut.

You know who else
has a great body?

Charlie's fiancÃ©e.

In fact, Charlie calls
her boobalicious.

I'm really happy you
found somebody, Charlie.

Thank you. She's great.
Really, really great.

Boobalicious.

So if you're not dancing,
what are you up to?

Well, believe it or not,
I'm trying for a singing career.

No kidding. That's terrific.

You know who's
a wonderful singer?

Charlie's fiancÃ©e?

Uh, actually, I was gonna
say Ms. Celine Dion.

I have no idea about Chelsea.

Although she does have
a set of lungs on her.

Right.

So listen, I'm putting together
a demo of some songs.

Any chance you could help me with
the arrangements, maybe play piano?

Oh, wow.

That sounds like fun.

It's just, you know, kind of
awkward 'cause, you know...

He's getting married.

Maybe I can find
you somebody else.

That'd be terrific.
Let me give you my number.

Are you still at 696-336-725?

Yeah, I can't believe
you remember it.

Well, I have a little
memory trick.

If you change the numbers to letters,
it spells out "oxofempal."

Oh, good trick.

I should get going.

Wonderful to see you again.

Same here.

- You too, Alan.
- Bye-bye.

- Charlie?
- Yeah?

I've missed you.

Oxofempal?

Hot, hot, hot! Ow!

You have to dial one first.







Hey, Berta, what do you
know about Percocet?

I know three of them with a Mickey's big mouth
can make you run buck naked through a Taco Bell.

Why do you ask?

Well, my mom says Grandma Lenore can't hold
the new baby until she stops popping them.

That's probably a good idea.

You drop one kid, you gain
a reputation as a kid dropper.

So how do you like
having a new baby sister?

Well, she eats,
she sleeps, she poops.

So far I'm not impressed.

Give her a bad haircut
and she'd be you.

Excuse me, but I paid
nine bucks for this haircut.

Sorry.

Besides, the baby doesn't
look anything like me.

In fact, she doesn't look like
my mom or my stepdad either.

Who does she look like?

Kind of like a girl
version of my dad.

I thought your dad was
the girl version of your dad.

I'm telling you,
Charlie, it's a bad idea.

What's the big deal?

I'm just gonna find
her a piano player.

Oh, come on, I saw the way
you looked at her.

You say "piano player,"
but you mean organist.

Oh, that's ridiculous.

I'm engaged to Chelsea. I'm living
with Chelsea. I'm in love with Chelsea.

- What's Chelsea's phone number?
- What?

What does it spell?
You know, your little memory trick.

Oh, uh...

it's... jklpuzo.

Really?

Let's, uh, let's test it out.

Uh, is that, uh, 818-jklpuzo

or, uh, 310-jklpuzo?

All right, all right,
I-I made it up.

But I don't have to
call Chelsea; she lives here.

You don't have to
call Mia either.

Oh, yeah?

Well, what about you and Melissa?

- What does that have to do with anything?
- Nothing! I'm changing the subject to your peccadilloes.

You were banging Melissa in the hospital storage closet
while your ex-wife was giving birth to your daughter!

- We don't know she's my daughter.
- Who's your daughter?

You're my daughter,
I'm your daughter!

This whole court is
out of daughter!

Al Pacino?

Great movie.

Hoo-ah!

See that one?

That was close.

Good thing he's slow.

Yeah, well, Judith's mom
dropped him when he was a baby.

Wow.

Yeah.

What brought that on?

You're the one who
started talking dirty.

All I said is,
"What'd you do today?"

There you go again,
you nasty girl.

Okay, seriously,
what did you do today?

Nothing.

Just a regular day.

Had coffee with you,
hung out with Alan a little bit,

then came home, had
a drink, took a nap,

next thing I know you're walking in
the front door with your whore talk.

All right, whatever.

Oh, yeah, there was
one other thing.

Really?

Yeah, I ran into an old buddy.

What's her name?

Her? Why do you assume it's a her?

When you've seen one of your old guy friends,
you don't try to hump me into a coma.

Fair point.

It was Mia.

Mia, the old buddy
you almost married?

Yeah.

And?

And nothing.

Well, she did ask me if I'd help her
out with this music thing she's doing.

- But I said no.
- How come?

I thought it'd be inappropriate.

Why? You still have
feelings for her?

No, no, of course not.

Then why wouldn't
you help her out?

What?

I mean, if she's just a friend,
then why would it be inappropriate?

Okay.

Uh, no reason.

So you're saying
I should help her out?

Unless you still
have feelings for her.

- I guess I'll help her.
- Good.

Good.

Or bad.

Probably bad.

I'm gonna go with bad.

Hi, Charlie!

We were just having a little
moonlight skinny dip in the ocean.

Good thinking.

Nothing more romantic than seaweed
hanging from a cold, shriveled penis.

There's no seaweed--
Oh, my...

Don't put it on the table!

Sorry.

Alan, what do you say we take a hot shower
and un-shrink the Snuffleupagus?

He'll be fine.

It's Bert and Ernie
I'm worried about.

I think Bert has
ascended to my rib cage.

You go ahead.
I'll be right there.

- Okey-doke.
- Okay.

Hey, uh, can I
ask you something?

I am not gonna help you
find your missing testicle.

No, no, it's about Melissa.

What about her?

Well, now that we're
seeing each other again,

the fact that she still lives with
her mom presents kind of a problem.

Why? 'Cause you
tickled mom's Elmo?

It was just light necking.

I never touched her Elmo.

Anyway,

since you set the precedent of
having girlfriends move in here,

- uh, I was wondering if maybe...
- No.

Why not? You let
Chelsea move in.

It's my house.

You are a guest.

And by "guest," I mean leech
I tolerate until our mother dies

and she can't lay a guilt trip on me
for kicking your ass to the curb.

You're gonna kick me
out when Mom dies?

You're planning on being
here until Mom dies?

Okay, okay, we're
getting off subject.

What about Jake?
You let Jake move in.

You're not helping
your case here, Alan.

- But I'm just saying...
- I said no!

Hmm. Hey, Bert, welcome back.

* You'll never find *

* As long as you live *

* Someone who loves you *

* Tender like I do *

* You'll never find *

* No matter where you search *

* Someone who cares about you *

* The way I do *

* Whoa, I'm not bragging
on myself, baby *

* 'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else *

* No... one else. *

That's a pretty mouth,
but it ain't made for singing.

- What's it made for?
- Eating.

Oh.

I thought maybe
she meant oral sex.

* You're gonna miss my lovin' *

* You're gonna miss,
miss, miss my love. *

So?

Wow.

- You want to run it again?
- I don't.

I mean, there's a danger
of over-rehearsing it.

Yeah. Plus I kind of
nailed it, right?

I don't see it
getting any better.

That is so sweet, Charlie.

Thank you.

I don't know how
I'd do this without you.

Hey, I don't deserve any credit.

God gave you that voice.
I had nothing to do with it.

- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hey, hi!

There she is!

Chelsea, this is Mia.
Mia, this is Chelsea.

- Hi.
- Hi!

We were just rehearsing.

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

What? No-no, no,
there's nothing to interrupt.

She's singing,
I'm playing piano,

Alan, Berta and Jake are
right there in the kitchen.

Guys, Chelsea's home.

Yay.

- I should get going.
- Good.

I mean, you don't
have to, but good.

Rehearsal was good.

You've got yourself
a terrific guy here.

- I know. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

- I'll see you Saturday at the studio?
- You bet.

* You'll never find... *

No, no, save your voice.

Yikes.

So, how'd it go?

Well, uh, how can I put this?

She's the picture you stick on the cover of
an album by a fat girl who can actually sing.

That's not what I mean.

Were there any, you know, sparks?

No, no sparks.

Why would there be sparks?

I'm with you. We're engaged.

We're gonna be married.
You and me, that's the sparks...

baby.

Relax, Charlie, I trust you.

Okay, lady, you're really
starting to piss me off.

Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

No problem, Charlie, as long as you're
willing to pay my weekend rates.

You've got weekend rates?

Yep, and you probably don't
want to waste time haggling.

Now, what's the big emergency?

Well, you might not think it's
a big emergency, but trust me, it is.

Okay.

I'm really constipated.

You do realize which end of
the body I specialize in?

I know, I knowI'm not
here for an enema.

Good, because that couch
isn't Scotchguarded.

I'm thinking it's psychosomatic
'cause I've tried coffee,

fiber, laxatives and something
my housekeeper said was a suppository,

but I now suspect
was a practical joke.

All right,
so psychosomatic constipation.

Good name for rock band, huh?

Weekend rates, Charlie.

Tell me what's going on in your life.
How are things with you and your fianc?

Great, great! She lives with me now.

We're planning the wedding.
Couldn't be better.

Good. And how's work?

Well, it's been pretty slow,

but thankfully,
the house is paid off,

my pension is funded,
and I've given up prostitutes.

So, really, all I need is drinking money,
and what's that, a couple grand a month?

That sounds about right.

Hey, do you remember Mia?

Your ex-fianc?the dancer.

Wow, you remember.

I'm not sitting here
sketching ponies, Charlie.

- Anyway, I ran into her.
- Really? And how'd that go?

Fine, fine. She looks great,

she's single again,
told me she missed me.

Uh-huh.

I always dig that.

Then she asked me if I could help her out
with this music project, and I said no.

But then Chelsea said if I didn't still
have feelings for her, why not do it?

So I did it.

Interesting. When did
all this happen?

Three of four days ago.

And how long have
you been constipated?

I don't know.
Three, four days.

Hey, you think
there's a connection?

I'm leaning that way.

Look, Charlie, you obviously
still have feelings for Mia,

and yet you're
committed to Chelsea.

It's an emotional conflict,

and until you resolve that conflict,
you're going to be physically blocked.

English, please?

As soon as you pick one,
you can go two.

What happens if I can't pick?

I don't know. C-section?

Anyway, she said I have to
resolve the conflict

because my emotions are
strongly connected to my lower intestine.

That makes a certain
amount of sense.

You think with your penis,
and your head's up your ass.

The baby just came!

Baby?

Well, it's not technically a baby,
but we know it's gonna look like you.

Hey, Charlie

Hey.

What's she still doing here?

Not still. She went away,
she came back.

She's not moving in, Alan.

Of course not.
You said no, it's no.

We're out of milk, sweetie.
I'm gonna run to the market.

Okay.

She likes milk.

So how are you gonna
resolve your conflict?

I'm not sure.

I may have to sleep with Mia.

What?!

Okay, here's the deal.

If I back out of
the recording session with Mia,

Chelsea will think I still
have feelings for her.

All right.

However, if I spend any more time
with Mia without sleeping with her,

I'm gonna split open
like a roasted pistachio.

Nobody wants that!

Charlie, cheating on Chelsea makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever.

That's what I thought,
but my shrink was pretty adamant.

Just promise if
anything happens to me,

you'll raise it as your own.

* Down in Louisiana *

* Where the alligators
grow so mean *

* Lived a girl that
I swear to the world *

* Made the alligators
look tame *

* Poke salad Annie *

I know, I know it's hard
to believe I'm not banging her.

Then why are we here?

She's an old friend.
I'm helping her out.

You really want to help her out?
Sneak up behind her with a big rock.

Detox?

No, constipated.

'Cause you're detoxing?

- Can we just do this?
- Fine.

* 'Cause your mama was
working on the chain gang *

* Poke *

* Salad.*

That one felt really good.

Okay, help me understand something.
You're hoping to bang her, right?

Can I hear a little?

Sure. Play it back.

* Down in Louisiana *

That's me?

That's you.

Wow.

I had no idea I was so good.

Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy!

Oh, well, if you're happy, I'm happy.

Why did I ever let you go?

If I recall, you had
a list of reasons.

Well, I was wrong.

How can I make it up to you?

Um, how do you want
to make it up to me?

Wow.

There it is.

Let's do this last track,
and then we can go back to my place.

Maybe we can sweeten
her vocals with some reverb,

a little echo,
lay a little guitar over it?

We can lay car horns and barking
dogs over it. It won't help.

I'm ready.

Just relax and feel
the groove, okay?

I got it.

Okay, this is "Boogie-woogie
Bugle Boy." Take one.

* He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way *

* He had a boogie style that
no one else could play, whoo! *

* He was the top man
at his craft *

* And then his number came up,
and he was going to the draft *

* He's in the army now,
blowing reveille *

* He's the boogie-woogie
bugle boy of Company B *

Okay, Mia, hold it,
hold it a sec.

Is something wrong?

Yeah, kind of. You can't sing.

What?

You got no talent.

I'm sorry, but we're
both wasting our time here.

I love Chelsea. I'm gonna marry her,
and I can't see you anymore.

Are you kidding?

You can't just walk
out on me! You...

- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall.

- Thanks.
- No,thank you.

I should have known this would happen,
you lowlife son of a bitch!

Uh, the lowlife son
of a bitch is gone,

but I think you have a real gift,
and we shod work together.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

You might want to
give it a minute.

You were in there
with your guitar?

You never know when
inspiration might strike.

That's called "Two Burritos
and a Root Beer Float."

Hey...??

???

??

???

??

???

Oh...??

- Well...???
- ??

- ???
- OK.

- Alen.
She...??

???

??



.......... ********** ..........

* Men. *

Hey, Danny.

Did you say good morning
to Melissa?

Good morning, Melissa.

You look lovely today.

Thank you, Danny

I think he's got
a little thing for you.

No, you've got
a little thing for her.

I've got a croquet mallet
in my pants.

Al, I thought I told you
to keep that doll in your room.

Come on.

He's got to feed
the broad sometime.

See what I did there?

You're so clever.

How about spaghetti with pesto
for dinner tonight?

Oh, boy, with the pine nut
You got it.

I've got your pine nuts
right here.

Danny.

Buy one, get one free.

Okay, Al, I'm only going
to ask you this once.

Has litt Miss Muppet
moved into my house?

What? No. Huh-uh.

Really?

Then explain why she's
here when I go to bed

and still here
when get up.

Well, to be fair, Charlie,

you do have an erratic
sleep schedule.

And that's not even
counting the drunken blackouts.

So you're saying I continually
miss it when she goes home?

Charlie, you missed Easter
last year.

Was that the time I woke up

with a Cadbury egg
melted in my short

Sadly enough, no.

Okay, okay,
just so you understand

this is my house and you don't
get to invite people to move in.

Why do you keep harping on that?

She is not living here.

I'm just going to throw
in a load of laundry

before I go to work.

Sure looks like she is.

I don't know
what he's talking about.

Hey, listen,
I was thinking.

Why don't we bring my bed over
from my mother's house?

We've already got a bed.

This isn't a bed,
it's a fold-out couch.

And you're the one who's always
complaining about it.

Oh, I complain
about a lot of things.

Like, uh, like automatic
flush toilets.

I mean, everything's gone
before you get a chance

to turn around
and check out how you did.

What the dickens
are you talking about?

Let's just leave the furniture
the way it is.

I don't want to rock the boat.

How is getting
a decent bed

rocking the boat?

This is our room, isn't it?
Well, yeah.

And-and no. I mean...

It's still Charlie's house.

But you pay rent?
Of course.

I mean, you know,
the actual number fluctuates

depending on the economy
and whether Charlie's conscious

on the first of the month.
But yeah, I pay.

Okay, then you need to start
standing up to him.

Oh, please.

I stand up to him plenty.
Is that so?

You think he likes
unsalted butter?

He does not.

Now you listen
to me, Alan Harper.

You are a strong,
assertive man.

I know that because I
couldn't be with you

if you were anything less.

Oh, well, yeah, I am.

You know, I...
I don't want to flaunt

my strong assertiveness by,
you know, asking for stuff.

Alan, you need
to tell your brother

we're moving my bed in here
and if he doesn't like it,

well, then that is just
his tough noogies.

Okay, I will tell him.

Good.
But slowly.

As I did with the butter.

And how long did that take?

That is not important.

What's important is this is now

a low sodium,
heart smart household.

He thinks he's fooling me,
But he's not.

She's living here.

He moved her in
right under my nose.

So?

So this is
the unsalted butter again,

but, you know, writ lae.

What difference does it
make if she lives here?

"What difference?"

Are you kidding?

First it's him
and his stinky kid

and now he's shacking up
with Strawberry Shortcake!

He pays rent,
doesn't he?

I don't know.

Once, maybe.

He says he did.

So why do you care
who he has in his room?

I care because...

There's a principle involved.

"A principle"?

Yes! I made a rule.

Ooh, you made a rule.

Yes, I made a rule.

And I'm making another one.

You do not get
to mock my rules.

You're being silly, Charlie.

Melissa is
a wonderful girl.

They love each other
and she makes him happy.

And I care about
that because...?

Because the Charlie Harper
that I fell in love with

cares about other
people's happiness.

That's the Charlie Harper
you fell in love with, huh?
Yes.

Well, joke's on you.

That whole nice guy
thing was a big act

to get you to have sex with me.

Ha-ha.

I know you'll do the
right thing, Charlie.

Oh, you do, huh?

Most of the time, I'm not even
sure what the right thing is.

* Men. *

Hey.

Hey.
Got a minute?

I'm reading.

Okay, we'll talk later.

Damn it, Alan, get back out there!

But I got to pee.
You already peed, now go!

(door opens and closes)

Hey-ho.

What do you want, Alan?
Well...

as you know, I pay my fair share
of rent around here.

We probably have different
definitions of "fair."

And "share."

And "rent," but go on.

I-I-I just don't think
I need your permission

when it comes to Melissa
living with me.

Well, you're wrong.
Nice talking to you.

Charlie.

I would hope that...
Don't Charlie me.

This is my house.

Not yours, mine.

And the fact is
if Melissa moves in,

that means you've got more
people living here than I do.

So?

So there's a principle
involved...

...that we must discuss.

Okay, so what's
the principle?

The principle is that...

you're my brother
and I want you to be happy.

So Melissa can stay?

I mean, move in?

Sure.

Well, all right then.

(exclaims)

* Men. *

You know,
I was thinking.

You've got me.
Alan's got Melissa.

Even Jake's got a girlfriend.

We need to find somebody
for Sir Lancelot.

Your cat?

Yeah. Doesn't he deserve
some happiness?

He can lick his own crotch.
What else does he need?

Come on, Charlie.

Why shouldn't he have
so companionship?

All right.

How about we get him
nice lady coyote?

Charlie!

What? It'd be good
for ol' Lance.

Get a little exercise
running for his life.

You're terrible.

(phone ringing)

Let the machine get it.

Hi, this is Alan.

And this is Melissa.

We're not home right now
and neither are Charlie
and Chelsea.

Well, Charlie might be
home, but he's probably

in no condition to answer.

Leave a message
when you hear the beep.

Beep!

(machine beeps)

Hello, Charlie?

It's your mother.

Remember me?

The woman who carried you
in her womb

for roughly
seven and a half mons.

Anyway, I'd say call me,
but what's the point?

I've long since
given up expecting

any kind of consideration...

"Seven and a half months"?

She always said,
"If God wanted us to lose our figures

he wouldn't have invented
C-sections and incubators."

Oh, hey, all.

We're home.

Oh, boy.
Hi.

Charlie?

Hi.

Oh, uh, just so you know,

Melissa and I are going to put our food
on the bottom shelf

and you guys can take the top
and we'll split the door, okay?

That's a great idea.

No, it's not.
It's my refrigerator.

Be quiet.

I bought it.
I paid for it.

Charlie!
The whole thing, not just half.

Stop being a child.

I'm just saying.
I'm not going to forfeit

a grape soda just because
I put it on the wrong shelf!

Mind if we join you guys?
Sure.

What are we watching?

An Odd couple rerun.

Oh, I never really
liked that show.

Why not?
I don't really buy the premise.

I mean, you know, who in his right mind
would put up with somebody

who drives him crazy
for all those years?

I mean, it would be
different if they were reled.

* Men. *

That was fun picking out
our wedding crystal.

Oh, yeah.
Barrel of monkeys.

I'm so excited
about that big punch bowl.

You know what would be
really exciting?

Next time you ask me to go
shopping with you,

use it to cave in my skull.

What the hell is this?

Oh, look who's here.

He dude, party down.

What are you doing?

We invited a few friends over.

You don't have any friends.

Yeah, but Melissa does.

So now they're mine, too.

They don't
really like you.

They do, too.

Dream on, meat puppet.

Who said you could have a party?

I'm sorry.
I thought we lived here.

Must we check with you
about everything we do?

Yes!

What's that guy drinking?

Is that my grape soda?

It was on our shelf.

What'd I tell ya?

Okay, that's it.
Charlie...

No-no-no. No, no, this is
not acceptable.

Hey, everybody!

Everybody listen up.

(music stops)

Party's over.

Pack up your crap and get out.

I'm not kidding!

One.

I'm counting to three,
by the way.

Two.

Ah, screw it.

I'll leave.

Charlie.

Forget it.
I'm out of here.

(crowd chatter)

See what happens
when I do the right thing?

Okay, I think you're
really overreacting,

but if you want to spend
the night at a hotel, fine.

No, I ll not come over there
for a quickie.

Good-bye, Charlie.

He just needs to cool off.

We're really sorry, Chelsea.

We probably should have talked
to you guys

before inviting
our friends over.

Your friends?

Maybe we just need
some kind of system

where we give each other
a heads up about guests.

That's a great idea.

Excuse me.

Since when do you two call
the shots around here?

What are you
talking about?

All right, ladies,

let's make something very clear.

There is an established
pecking order in this house

that needs to be honored.

Oh, really?

And what might that be?

Wow.

(laughs)

Do I have to spell it out?

Please do.

Fine.

When Charlie is not here,
I am in charge

That's okay, isn't it?

* Men.

Yeah?

Room service.

Guess who got himself kicked out
of the house.

Ow! Ow!

Cut it out!
Cut it out!

What are you
doing here, Alan?

Honestly, I didn't have
any place else to go.

Yeah, well, I got news
for you. You still don't.

Oh, come on, Charlie.

Alan, you're the reason
I'm here in the first place.

I know, I know. I might have
crossed a bit of a line.

A bit of a line?

You moved your girlfriend into
my house without telling me.

You invited strangers over
without my permission.

And then, then, to add
insult to injury,

you show up here with
your ugly friggin' dummy?!

Did you hear that?

He called you ugly.

Good-bye, Alan.

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

I...

I brought a peace offering.

That's my
ten-year-old Scotch!

No, it's not.

Yes, it is.

I saw him take it.
Oh!

Damn it, Danny,
what is wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

You're the one with your hand
between my little wooden cheeks.

All right, all right,
enough. Enough.

I'm gonna
drink scotch,

I'm gonna need ice.

There's a machine down the hall.

Be right back.

Yeah, like I don't have ice.

* Men. *

Thanks for letting
me back in.

You were crying
in the hallway.

The other guests complned.

Still, it's very
considerate of you.

Shut up and drink my scotch.

Cheers.

Bite me.

This is kind
of fun, though.

You and me sharing a hotel room
just like when we were kids.

Swell.

Remember that time Mom took us
on that Caribbean cruise?

We had our own cabin.

Yeah.

Took us three days to figure out
Mom was on another boat.

Good times.
Mmm.

We've lost our
house, Charlie.

Your house.

We've lost your house.

I know.

How did this happen?

Slowly.

In irements.

Starting with the butter.

I can see that now.

The problem is, the women have
established a beachhead.

(chuckling)

What?

Nothing. Nothing.

You just reminded me why
I bought a house in Malibu.

The thing is,

if we go back,
we'll appear weak.

I don't mind that.

No, no, we need a plan.

We need to figure out
some way

to drive a wedge
between those two.

You know, divide and conquer.

Oh, yeah, but how?

I'm not sure.

Maybe we should sleep on it.

Want to watch
some porn first?

No.

Why not?

I'm drunk in bed in a hotel room
with my brother,

and you want to know
why I don't want to watch porn?

Okay. Okay, I get it.

You don't want
to watch porn.

Mind if I watch?

(Danny screaming)

* Men. *

So they both just up and left, huh?

Yeah.
Uh-huh.

Those boneless chickens.

They'll be back.

They just have to get used
to the way things are now.

Damn right.

Girl power, my bitches.

Hey, Berta, why don't
you whip us up

some French toast
to celebrate?

Or, uh, we could do it.

Good plan...

my bitches.

Hello, anybody home?

In here.

Oh, what a nice surprise.

Good morning, ladies.

Berta.

Botox.

So where are the
boys this morning?

Oh well, Charlie's off, soaking
in a hotel.

Oh, really?

Well, what about Alan?

Oh, Alan's too cheap for a hotel.

I see.
And what brought this on?

A lot of macho nonsense.

Mm, and Alan?

Just nonsense.

No kidding.

Well, I'm glad to see you didn't
let them get away with it.

Thank you.
Thank you.

And I'm doubly pleased
that you two

have managed to put aside your
somewhat distasteful history

and bond the way
you obviously have.

What distasteful history?

Oh, come on, let them
make my breakfast first.

What are you
talking about, Evelyn?

A lot of women might resent
the former lover of their fiancÃ©

living in the same
house as them.

It ain't me, start cooking.

You and Charlie?

Just one little weekend.

But believe me, if I knew
what kind of man he was,

What's that
supposed to mean?

Oh, he's fine for you.

Fine for me?!

Well, I've got an early meeting.

Nice to see you girls.

Why didn't you
tell me?!

I thought you
were my friend!

I'm your friend?!

Hey, if it weren't for me,

your ass would've been
gone a long time ago...

I believe the balance of power
is restored.

Thanks, Mom.

Thank you.

You owe me large.

All right, sweetheart,
I think yore overreacting,

but if you want to spend
the night in a hotel

that's fine.

Hey, you want me to come over
for a quickie?

Kidding. Love you.

Damn.

Hey, at least Chelsea's
coming back.

Melissa said she'll never
set foot in this house again.

All's well that ends well, huh?

Bite me.

Oh, come on, the important thing
is, we got the house back.

And we're once again
kings of the castle.

That's true.

Hey, Celeste and
I are going  be

studying in my room.
Okay.

Oh, right.

Set another place for dinner.

She's going to be
joining us.

Fine.

Also, she's a vegetarian,
so no meat.

Got it.

Come on, Jake.

Coming.

Kings of the castle, my ass.

We're whipped
unto the third generation.



.......... ********** ..........

I said, "no!"

- And I said, "why not?"
- No!

- Why not?
- I don't have to give you a reason.

Dad, I got my learner's permit
but mom won't let me drive her car.

Just because they give 15-yo
learner's permits

doesn't mean they're ready to drive.

I've been driving for years.

Grand Theft Auto one,
Grand Theft Auto two.

And I never ran over anybody
but pimps and crack whores.

Sorry. Crack prostitutes.

Get started on your homework.

- Will you take me driving?
- We'll talk about it.

- When?
- Go to your room.

- I'm available now.
- Go!

Man, if I knew how to hot-wire
a real car, I'd so be outta here.

Thanks for bringing him by, I guess.

If you need to reach me, Herb and I

are going to Laguna beach
for a weekend getaway.

How nice!
Taking the baby?

Are you insane? I said "getaway."
Herb's lucky I'm taking him.

I see.
So... Who's watching little Millie?

My mother.

Are we sure that's a good idea?

First of all, there is no "we" here.

And what are you implying?

I'm implying that there might be
better choices for a babysitter

than a woman who has a sandwich named
after her at the Betty Ford clinic.

She's three years clean and sober,

all the charges were dropped
and she's great with Millie.

All right, all right.

I hope you don't mind, but I gave her
your number in case of emergency.

I don't.

So... how is the baby, anyway?

- Fine.
- Good, good.

Jake showed me some pictures.

I gotta say,
she doesn't look much like you.

And she doesn't look like Herb.

- Don't go there, Alan.
- Go where?

I'm not implying that someone
other than Herb could be the father.

Even though that someone
did have unprotected sex with you.

Approximately 9 months
before the birth of a child

that looks suspiciously like
that someone.

You get that I'm talking about me,
right?

Honey, if we wanna beat the traffic,
we should get going.

Did you hear?

Judith and I are spending
a romantic weekend in Laguna.

I said "weekend", Herb. That's all.

Okay, fine, no romance.

But sex is still on the table,
right?

Just get in the car.

- Can I drive?
- No.

Why not?

Is she gone?

Damn it!

Chelsea,
your cat's trying to kill me!

Is he okay?

The cat's fine!

Probably off
plotting his next move...

- Are you okay?
- No.

- What happened?
- Uncle Charlie fell.

Can I drive you to the hospital?

Season 7 Episode 03
"Mmm, fish. Yum"

Subtitle: Mr. Bo Jingles Team



Sir Lancelot!

Here, kitty, kitty!

He's probably hiding
because he thinks you're mad at him.

For God's sake, Chelsea, the cat
doesn't think anything except maybe:

"Fish, I'll eat it!"

Or "ooh, sand, I'll crap in it."

You're wrong.

He's very intelligent
and very intuitive.

He knows you resent him living here.

Thank you, Chelsea,
but I can defend myself.

I was talking about my cat.

I'm sorry.
Mmm, fish. Yum.

Okay, I'm going to work.

- Feel better.
- Thanks.

How's the shoulder?

The shoulder's fine.

I'm just hopin' to get a little
"Poor Charlie" tonight.

"Poor Charlie"?

Yeah. You know...

"Oh, poor Charlie..."

"I feel bad about your shoulder,

"so you just lie still while I provide
you with a series of intense orgasms."

I don't know what to say,
other than "oink."

Is that a car? Can I drive?

Relax,
it's just Chelsea going to work.

Uncle Charlie,
you need to go anywhere?

- Away from you.
- All right. I'll drive you.

You want to drive
my $80,000 Mercedes?

Yes, please.

It's good he's polite.

It's a necessary quality
in a doorman.

Was that a yes or a no?

- That was a no.
- So the doorman thing was an insult?

Yes.

And a prophecy.

Hello?

No, it's Charlie. Who's this?

I can't hear you. What?

Alan, it's for you.

Hello?

Hi, Lenore.

It's Judith's mother.

Is that the house alarm?

Is the baby okay?

All right, open the little panel
by the front door

and enter pound, star and the code.

Pound is the little
tic-tac-toe board.

Yeah, like on Hollywood squares.

She still poppin' the pain pills?

Good.
See if she's got any leftovers.

Okay, the code is Jake's birthday.

Your grandson.

Anyway, it's o-three-one-four...

Lenore,
don't punch it into the phone.

Calm down, calm down.

I'll be right there.
I will turn it off for you.

I gotta go.

You couldn't be more of a sucker
if you were on the end of a stick.

Why?

Because I'll take any excuse
to spend time with my daughter?

You don't know you're the father.

Come on. She's got my jawline,
my eyes, my ears.

You left out thinning hair
and poopy pants.

That was one time and I begged you
to stop at a gas station.

Thank god you're here.

I pushed all the buttons,
but I can't get it to stop.

That might be because you were adjusting
the thermostat.

There we go.

Thank god.

Here, let me see
if I can turn this alarm off.

Come here, Millie.
Come to papa...

... was a Rolling Stone

wherever he laid his hat
was his home...

Always sang this to Jake.

Worked like a charm.

And when he died...

all he left us was alone.

Look at that.

You're a miracle worker.

I just have a knack for babies.

And... and animals.

It's only English-speaking adults
that don't like me.

I think you're a wonderful fella.

And if you don't mind my saying,
I think Judith was a fool to let you go.

She didn't so much let me go

as drop me from an airplane
with an anvil necklace.

Okay, honey,
time to get your beauty rest.

I'm afraid that's gonna have to be
a long nap.

I hate to say it about
my own granddaughter, but let's face it.

With those big ears...

she looks a little like a fruit bat.

I think her ears
are the perfect size.

You would.

How about some wine?

Thank you,
but I really should get going.

Come on, join me.
Just one. We'll catch up.

It's really none of my business,

but do you think
you should really be drinking?

Because I've been to Betty Ford?

Because
you got kicked out of Betty Ford.

Britney bit me first.

Anyway,

I was there for pills.

I've never had a problem
with alcohol.

See? No problem.

Where did I hide
those muscle relaxers

I picked up in Mexico?

That's right.

Between my buttcheeks.

Turn around.

Uncle Charlie?

What?

You hungry?

'Cause if you are,
we could go get something to eat.

And I'll even drive.

Jake, I'm sleeping.

You know, you could nap in the car.

I just gotta have an adult with me.
They don't have to be conscious.

I'm not hungry.

Okay, fine.

Hey, want to go see a movie?
'Cause if you do...

Maybe after your nap.

Crap.

Now I'm awake.

Great. You hungry?

You're lucky you're single.

- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, no, trust me.

I've been married for 39 years!

Really? But Judith's 40.

Do you know what it's like
to wake up every morning,

year after year,
and see the same stupid

face lying next to you?

All I can tell you
is what I told your daughter.

If you don't like it, roll over.

Fred hasn't touched me in 14 years.

In his defense,

he did have that stroke.

Do you know
what happens to a woman's body

when it goes unloved for that long?

Oh, gee, Lenore, I don't really
feel comfortable talking about this...

Oh, Alan, come on,
we're both grown-ups.

Think about what I'm saying.

All right, well...

I'm getting an image of a...

A cave from an Indiana Jones movie.

What?!

You know...

cobwebs,

dust,

human skulls.

This is my vagina
we're talking about.

I am well aware
of what we're talking about.

I've been so lonely.

I'm...

I'm sorry, Lenore.

A stroke's starting to look
pretty good.

Can't I at least back it out?

Come on, nothing's gonna happen.

- Look, you wanna eat or not?
- Fine.

How about an empty parking lot?
Could I drive it then?

Jake, how many times I gotta tell...

What the hell was that?

I don't know.

Sounds like you ran over a cat.

Told you you should've let me drive.

Chelsea's gonna
completely freak out.

No, she will not be happy.

Doesn't even
look like a cat anymore.

More like a cat pancake.

Catcake.

Sorry.

- What am I gonna tell her?
- She doesn't have to know.

You're right.

She thinks Sir Lancelot's missing,
so he stays missing.

Sir squished-a-lot.

Let's just think what we gotta do.

We have to get rid of the body,
clean up the mess

then act like nothing's happened.

- Good plan, except...
- Except what?

Say, "cheese!"

What are you doing?

Making sure I get to drive your car
whenever I want to.

What?! Give me that!

Too late,
I already emailed it to myself.

You're bluffing.

Perhaps. But can you really afford
to take that chance?

Hush, little baby,

don't say a word

daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird

if that mockingbird don't sing...

Forget it, I'm not sleepy.

Let's go in the hot tub!

But I don't have a bathing suit.

Me neither.

Come on, stroke.

Judith...

This keeps getting better
and better.

Oh, hey, look who's up.

Hi, sweetie.

You need a little change?

Oh, yeah.

I'll let you in on a little secret.

Before this day is over,

I might need
to change my undies, too.

It's your mommy again.

Hello?

Oh, hey, Judith, what's up?

So, how's Laguna?

Laguna's fine.
My mother's not answering the phone.

I need you to go check on her
and the baby.

Me?

You... you want me to drive
all the way to sherman oaks

to check on your mother
who you assured me was clean and sober?

What's that?

That is the...
is the tv that I am watching.

The... Baby channel.

A... documentary about obese babies.

Tragic.

Okay, listen, I-I will check up
on your mother for you but...

- you owe me one.
- Oh, Alan...

Ta-da!

Not bad.

What's not bad?

I mean, it's not a bad idea
for me to check up on her.

Thank you.
Call me when you get there.

Oh, Judith...

Look who mowed the front lawn.

So, we're agreed.

We will never speak of this again.

Well, that kind of depends on you,
doesn't it?

I've already got the shovel, Jake.

I can dig another hole.

Charlie, I'm home!

Hi, sweetie, how was work?

Okay. I was a little worried
about Sir Lancelot.

- Have you seen him?
- No, haven't seen him, not a trace.

What about you, Jake?

No, but if I was a cat
I'd probably be on the beach.

'Cause, is one big litter box
and the ocean is a giant fish bowl.

Kind of a sushi bar
in your bathroom.

Wow, how great would that be?

I guess.

I'll still feel better
when he comes back.

We all will.

- You're quite the little liar?
- I'm 15. My life depends on it.

Chelsea, uncle Charlie's
gonna take me driving.

- Can we bring you back anything?
- No, thanks.

That woman just cut you off!

Learn how to drive, you whore!

- Yeah, I'm talking to you!
- Lenore,

Lenore,
we should probably keep it down.

- We don't want to wake the baby.
- What baby?

Oh, right.

Woof.

Hello, Judith.

Yeah, I was just about to call you.
The baby's fine,

- nothing to worry about.
- Hey, Judy, Judy, Judy!

Yeah, yeah, that's her.

Blotto.

No need to rush home,
everything's under control.

We're in the car,

Millie's sleeping in the back seat
and we're heading for Malibu.

Ehab-ray.

Ehab-ray?

You said you were taking me
for crabcakes at gladstone's.

Well, I'm sorry,
but you don't have a choice here.

The hell I don't.

Lenore? Lenore? Lenore!

Red light.

Slow down, slow down, stop!

You're making me really nervous,
you know that?



Hey, you mind getting me
another grape soda?

Yeah, I mind.

Get it yourself.

Fine. I just have to send this jpeg
to chelsea real fast.

Okay, okay.

Look who finally came home!

Who?

Sir Lancelot.

You've been a bad kitty cat.

I've been so worried about you.

Okay, I'm confused.

If that's Sir Lancelot,
then what did we squash?

Your hope of ever getting
behind the wheel of my car again.

Oh, man.

Leverage is a fickle bitch,
my friend.

I got it!

Can I help you?

Sorry to bother you. I live down
the beach and I'm looking for my cat.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I haven't seen it.

In fact, I just found my little guy.

I'm really worried.

He's black and white, about yay big.

Answers to puss-puss.

I'll keep an eye out for him.

Looks like the fickle bitch is back.

.......... ********** ..........

Call now. Operators are standing by.

- What are you doing?
- I'm calling them.

Don't you want to be able to scramble
an egg while it's still in the shell?

Okay... new rule-- you can't drink
while we watch cable television.

You won't say that when you get a
blanket with sleeves for Christmas.

Hi, Jake.

Can I offer you some fruit and cheese?

- You can, but I won't eat it.
- Okay.

So what's new? How's your girlfriend?

That's kind of personal, isn't it?

Sorry. I'm just curious.

Why, you writing a book?

Yeah, it's called The Day
Jake's Uncle Kicked His Ass.

Whatever.

Oh, no, don't go. We
so enjoy your company.

Did I do something wrong?

- Yeah, you anthropomorphized him.
- What?

It means treating something
that's not human as if it is.

You know, like you do with your cat.

Which frankly, makes more sense.

- I'm starting to think Jake resents me.
- See? You're still doing it.

Look, you can't take it
personal. He's a teenager.

You know, that awkward stage between
junior high and methadone clinic.

I just want to get to know him better.

I already know him. Trust
me, you're not missing anything.

Come on, there's got to be something
underneath that sullen exterior.

Yeah, a "D" student
with a perpetual boner.

Ginzu knives.

Kind of like high school, huh?

- I never did this in high school.
- Really? Sex in a car?

You're kind of built for it.

Oh, what the heck is this?

Oh, Jake's retainer.
He lost this years ago.

This cost me like,$500. Anyway...

No, this is not working for me.

- Want another wine cooler?
- No, I want to be in a real bed.

Well, what do you want me to
do? You won't stay at Charlie's.

How can I go back there after
his fiancee called me a tramp?

Oh, come on, she didn't mean it.

That was just heat of the moment when
she found out you'd slept with Charlie.

It doesn't bother you, does it?

Well, yeah, yeah, a bit, you know,
but beggars can't be choosers.

And I love you.

No, not here.

Well, then where?I'd be more than
happy to go back to your place

if you could just get past that
little incident with your mother.

Little incident? I caught
you in bed with her!

Boy, you are just going to keep
harping on that, aren't you?

Why don't we just got to a hotel?

Uh, well, we could, but wouldn't
that feel kind of cheap?

I'll tell you what feels
kind of cheap-- you.

- What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.

What-what, you're gonna walk home?

Well, it's not far, Alan. You didn't
want to waste the gas, remember?

- Pardon me for being
green. - Good-bye.

Oh, come on, Melissa! Let's
not ruin a beautiful evening!

I already broke the seal on the condom!

All right, all right. All
right, you win, you win.

I'll take you to a cheap motel.

Oh, great.

Stand up and put your
hands behind your head.

- Uh, I can explain this.
- Hands behind your head!

This is not what it looks like.

I-I-I was just chasing this
girl who jumped out of my car.

- You got a minute?
- I'm practicing.

Yeah, well, take a pause for the cause.

- What?
- Take five.

Five what?

Just shut up and listen to me!

- You have a problem with Chelsea?
- No.

- So what's with the attitude?
- What attitude?

I just don't consider fruit
and cheese an acceptable snack.

I don't care. You were rude.

- Kettle corn-- that's a
snack. - That's not the point.

Nachos-- that's a
proper use of cheese.

All right, all right, listen to me.

You're hurting Chelsea's feelings and I need
you to make an effort to be nicer to her.

Hey, it's not my problem if
your girlfriend's oversensitive.

Yeah, it kind of is.

If you guys can't get along,
then one of you has got to go.

- And guess who that's going to be?
- Why? Just 'cause you sleep with her?

Good for you. Why do
people think you're stupid?

'Cause of my grades.
Actually,I'm an underachiever.

Just be nice to Chelsea, all right?

Fine.

Well, that was uncalled for.

Just F.Y.I.,your son's a moron.

- No, he's an underachiever.
- Where have you been?

- Had a date with Melissa.
- How'd it go?

She broke up with me and I may
have to register as a sex offender.

Well, as long as you had fun.

Charlie, do you have any idea how
difficult it is to maintain a relationship

when you don't have a place of your own?

Alan, if I didn't have a place of my own,

I'd be worried about more important
things than a relationship.

Like, you know, getting
a place of my own.

So, you're saying I'm not
entitled to a relationship?

No,I'm saying if you can't afford
dog food you don't get a dog.

Oh, great, so I'm just supposed to
be alone for the rest of my life?

No, you're supposed to get
your own freakin' place!

Just 'cause you keep saying it,
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

How's the French toast, Jake?

It's bread dipped in eggs.
You can't really screw it up.

It's fine.

It's the best damn French toast I've
ever had in my whole freakin' life.

Now stop kicking me.

Okay, guys, I'll see you later.

- Oh, you're working on a Sunday?
- Well, kind of.

Since my brother and I are both extremely
anxious for me to get my own place--

me, because I'd like a sense of autonomy,
and him, because he's a spiteful turd--

I have found a way to
earn some extra money.

Great. Put me down for three boxes of
Thin Mints and some Peanut Butter Sandies.

Ah, Girl Scout cookies?
I like those Samoas.

I'm not selling cookies, Jake.

Then what are you selling? It better
not be your liver-- I got dibs.

Hello. Where is my new assistant?

Oh, you didn't.

Morning, all. Here, darling, put this on.

Ooh, snazzy. Do I get to keep it?

No, but if this works out,
I'll sell it to you at cost.

- You're going to work for Mom?
- What else am I supposed to do?

I don't know, some job that
lets you keep your self-respect.

Like, you know, man whore...

Dog de-wormer...

Outhouse inspector.

- Morning, Charlie.
- Hey, Mom. How are you?

Laxative tester, horse inseminator.

I'm going to work weekends
with Mom selling real estate,

and she's going to give
me a piece of the action.

No, I said having an assistant would give me
a little peace so I could get some action.

Well, whatever. It's a start. Let's go.

No, dear.I say,"Let's go""

- Oh, oh, okay.
- Let's go.

Stop. Take my bag. Now let's go.

This is going to be fun.

Okay,I'm done.

He didn't say thank you.

He's leaving the room.
We should thank him.

Jake, come back in here and
say thank you to Chelsea.

Jake,I'm warning you.

Jake!

Thank you, Chelsea.

Now was that so hard?

Oh, welcome, welcome. Please
sign in. Take a flyer.

- There's juice and cookies in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

I know, you think you'd never use
a bidet, but trust me, once you do,

you'll never go back to just wiping.

Anyway, if you're not ready to buy,
the owners are willing to lease.

Thank you.

You're very welcome. Thanks for coming.

Oh, the rat bastards live
right across the street.

They probably just came
for the free cookies.

Um, Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.

Number one or number two?

What difference does it make?

Alan,I'm trying to sell a house here.

Warm cookie smell, good--
hot poop smell, bad.

- I'll wait.
- You're damn right you'll wait.

So the people who own this
live mostly in New York?

Oh, they have homes all over the place.

Probably don't even
remember they have this one.

- Hardly seems fair.
- Want fair? Go live on a kibbutz.

Funny. How's that work, exactly?
Do you have to be Jewish?

Oh, welcome, welcome. Please sign in.

Uh, there's juice and
cookies in the kitchen.

Loose floorboard.

Okay, we need to talk about
your kid and my fiancÃ©e.

I already talked to him, and he promised
to stay out of her underwear drawer.

What?

Not that he ever went into
it. It's just a precaution.

Alan, I don't think you realize...

Look, look, look, I would love to have this
conversation, but I've got to get to work.

- It's 9:00 at night.
- Tell that to our mother.

People want to see a house at night and she's
got a date, guess who has to show the house?

Well, fine, at least take
the rhesus monkey with you.

Oh yeah, nothing sells a multi-million dollar home
more than a 15-year-old boy with greasy hair and BO.

Okay, let him stand on the lawn in
a jockey costume, holding a lantern.

Look, you're the one who said
I needed to get my own place.

This is what I got to do.

You don't fool me. You're
never leaving. Never!

That's it. I'm done
trying with that kid.

When did my life turn
into Leave it to Beaver?

It was more fun when it
was Leave it to Beaver.

- Okay, numb nuts, what did you say to Chelsea?
- Nothing.

- Then why is she so upset?
- I don't know.

Maybe it's her period. She says
it wasn't, but I don't believe her.

Welcome to our love
nest, my tiny sparrow.

This is unbelievable.

How can you afford it?

Well, I didn't buy it,
of course. I'm renting.

I don't get it.

Just the other day we were
going to do it in your car

because you didn't want to
shell out $59 for a hotel room.

It was $69, but, uh...
But this is different.

I, uh... I get a tax break on
it. You know, the home office.

So, you've moved out of
your brother's house?

Uh, well, not quite yet.
This is just a pied-a-terre.

Besides, I might flip it and move
up to something a little bigger.

But you said you're renting.

Yes, yes,I'm renting...
with-with an option to flip.

But let's not talk
money. Let's talk love.

Shall we go try out the bed?

The bed? With the--
with the sheets?

Beds are so bourgeois, don't you think?

Ooh, Alan. The couch?

Uh, actually I was thinking right
here in front of the fireplace...

on this beach towel.

Come on. I was trying to be nice.

By asking her if she was on her period?

- I was taking an interest.
- You're an idiot.

Why are you making it personal?
I'm not making it personal.

Okay, here's the deal.

You two are going to stay in
here and work this thing out

until you're either getting
along or one of you is dead.

FYI, she can kick your ass.

Have fun.

So... I guess you owe me an apology.

I've never seen you
so forceful and virile.

Oh, thank you, thank you.
You were wonderful, too.

You're-You're still on the towel, right?

You know what I think?

I think finally making love in a place
of our own has given you more confidence.

Well, truth be told, I
do feel kind of cocky.

No pun intended.

- Oh, it is so intended.
- You got me.

Yes, I do.

I want to make love to you
in every room in this house.

I don't see any reason why not.

As long as we bring the towel.

Of course, we're going to have
to wait about a half hour,

give my erectile medication a chance
to overcome my anti-depressants.

Complicated man, Alan Harper.

And I've got the medicine
chest to prove it.

- Whoopsie.
- Oh, damn it!

Sorry.

Sorry doesn't get out the stain.

- Do you have any club soda?
- How the hell would I know?

Don't rub! Blot, blot, blot!

- Stop yelling at me!
- Just get out of the way.

- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. I just...

Oh, no!

That's your whoopsie.

Oh, my mother's going to kill me!

What does your mother
have to do with it?

Are you kidding? She doesn't
even let me poop here!

Hey, so, how did everything work out?

Sit down, Charlie.

- Why?
- Just sit.

Okay.

What's going on?

We figured out what the
problem is between us.

- Well, great. What is it?
- You.

Well, this ought to be good.

You told Jake that he should be nice
to me because I was oversensitive?

Well, I don't know that I
said those actual words.

And you called me a "D" student
with a perpetual... you know what.

Boner. Yeah, those were my actual words.

Charlie, don't you see how you're the one
who's been driving a wedge between us?

No, not really.

I told you he wouldn't get it.

Well, hang on a second. Hang on.

You're blaming me because you
two can't get along and now...

You're right. You're
right. I'm the problem.

I am so sorr It won't ever happen again.

- Thank you.
- Thanks.

"Perpetual" means "pointy," right?

Okay, I think I got it all out.

You didn't have to yell.

I know. I'm... I'm sorry. I
don't know what got into me.

- It was just an accident.
- I know.

You hurt my feelings.

Again, I am so sorry.

Come here.

Now, wait till you see the panoramic
city to ocean views at night.

Why are we running?

- Well, remember when I told you I rented this house?
- Yeah?

I lied.

Oh, no. Not again.

Okay. Okay. Just let me
do the talking. Melissa?

Get down on your knees, and
put your hands behind your head.

Uh, okay. Okay. First of all,
let me explain the erection.

What's going on?

Not much.

Where's Jake and Chelsea?

They went to the movies together.

Oh, how nice.

Yep. Life is good.

So, did you sell that house?

Uh, no. Actually,I'm not
working for Mom anymore.

You quit?

Yeah, let's say that.

And while we're at it,
let's say I dumped Melissa

and decided she never wants to
see me again as long as she lives.

Okay.

Oh, uh, hey, you know how they say
if you take one of those pills

and your erection lasts for more than
four hours, you should call a doctor?

- Yeah.
- What time is it?

.......... ********** ..........

Not yet. Not yet.

Ok,wait for the traffic until cleared

And then turn into the left lane.

Not yet. Not yet.

Okay. Go

Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

All right, good.

Good, well done.

Thank yo

What are you doing?

Driving.

Both hands-- ten and two.

Twelve.

No, no, like a clock.

10:00 and 2:00.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Put your left hand on the wheel.

Fine.

You got to like that he can add ten and two.

Yeah.

And he did it in his head.

(music plays on radio)

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Concentrate on the road.(turns off ra

What? You listen to the radio while you drive.

I'm an experienced driver.

You dre like an old woman.

An experienced old woman.

My point is, never take your eyes off the road

Hey, don't distract the kid.

He can barely crap and read at the same time.

I can, too! Don't look at me!

ok at the road! Don't yell at him! Jake, look out!

Look out! (horn blaring)

Will you guys just let me drive?

Fine, fine.

Drive.

(breathing deeply)

So, Charlie, when's your, uh...

when's your fianc? back in town?

Uh... next week.

Huh. So, uh...

so herad's out of the hospital?

Huh.

Sohe had a bad hip?

No, Alan, he has a bad tooth,

but he went to the wrong doctor.

You don't have to be snide.

You don't have to ask dumb-ass questions.

He didn't ask me anything.

Yellow lht, yellow light, yellow light. Speed up.

Speed up, speed up, speed up!Slow down, slow down, slow down!

Okay, I've just abou had it with you two.

Now, if you don't quit it, I'm gog to turn this car around

and nobody's going to the movies.

Man, I've always wanted to say that.

I have to go to the bathroom.

You should have peed when he made that left turn, like I did.

Oh, there's, uh... there's three over there.

Too far away.

Why don't you ever wear your glasses? Because I don't need them.

Oh, really? So, why did your eye doctor prescribe them?

It's racket.

I think they print those charts blurry,

and then teld you it's your eyes.

Look, can we just sit down?

No, no, slide... slide over one.

Slide over one. I ne the aisle.

Why do you always need the aisle?

Because he's got a prostate the size of an apple,

and he has to pee evy five minutes.

There's nothing wrong with my ostate.

I've got a teeny bladder. It's genetic.

Another reason I think you were adopted.

Ha, ha.

Wasn't fun when I was six, not funny now.

For God's sake, can't you at least wait

until the lights go down?

I'm hungry.

Deled egg?

No.

Closthe lid.

It smells like a box of ass.

I don't know why they call them deviled eggs.

I think they're just heavey.

Why can't you just sneakn candy like a normal cheapskate?

Way ahead of you.

Still t these left over from last Halloween.

Shh.

What the hell are you doing?

How am I supposed to have a rum and Coke

without the rum?

You're not supposed to bring liquor

into a movie theater.

CHARLI Where are you going?

I'm going to sit over here.

But... but this is family time.

I like this family better.

Oh, damn it!

I have to pee.

Oh, great.

Focus!

Focus!

Focus!

Another great movie choice, Alan.

Excuse me, but it was recommended

by four out of five crics

who were not plowed when they saw it.

Can we please just get some ice cream?

You sure we need to buy some?

Your dad probably s gelato in his pants.

Uh-oh.

What? Nothing.

You know those girls? Kinda.

You want to go over and say hello?

Alan, don't be an idiot.

No teenar wants to be seen out with his father.

Especially when his father stinks of deviled ass eggs.

Yeah, but teenagers love to be sn

with degenerate rum-soaked uncles

who always dress like they're on line at Epcot Center.

Well, pardon me for having a personal style.

Will you guys please, please shuup?

Hi, Jake.

Hey.

Oh. She's cute.

Yoguys go to school together?

Of course they go to school together.

Where else is he going to meet a girl like that?

ALAN: He has outside interests. He could've met her anywhere.

He only has two outside interests,

and I don't thk he met her

at a taco truck or a public toilet.

You know what, I'm not hungry. Let's just go.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

We're not going anywhere.

I want ice cream.

Why, you going to pour rum on it? No.

Cr?e de cacao.

All that drinking. You know, feel sorry for you.

Don't feel sorry for m You're the reason I drink!

ALAN: Oh, plea! If it weren't for me,

you uld've choked on your own vomit years ago.

Hey, don't flatter yourself.

I was vomiti

in my sleep long before you came into my life,

and I'll be vomiting long after you're gone.

MAN: Next, please. Oh, y.

ALAN: Um...

uh, I would like to sample

the, uh... the Passion Fruit,

and the Banana Brickle,

and-- ooh-- uh, maybthe, uh, Nutty Butter Buddy.

Oh, geez-- why don't you just get a double scoop of gayberry

and be done with it?

What... What do you want, Jake?

A quick, painless death.

Hey, what happened to those cute rls?

They left.

Oh, too bad.

I think the one liked you.

They were looking over here a lot.

I know.

Next time, take a little initiative.

Yeah. We're not alys going to be here to support you.

So, you peek over your right shoulder

and slide it into the spot.

Parallel parking.

Easy peasy.

Are home?

We're dropping off Jake.

Oh.

I kind of got a sugar crash off that ice cream.

Oh, yeah, it had nothing to do

with the four ounces of liqueur you poured oveit.

Better liqueur than Halloween leftovers.

They charge 50 cents for each topping,

and I had perfectly good candy corn.

Okay, bye.

See you next weekend.

Yeah, maybe. What's that mean?

I'll call you.

Okeydoke.

Boy, you really pissed him off.

I pissed him off? What about you?

Hey, he likes me.

Oh, please. Nobody likes you.

We only tolerate you because you have a lot of money.

Alright, get out.

What are you talking about?

This is my car. Fine.

How much do you wt for it?

Don't be ridiculous.

We talking blue book? 'Cause I just put a new tire on it.

You are a lush!

You are a leec

You are a misogynist!

You are a mistake!

You are a...

What are we up to? "N."

Thank you.

Uh, you are a...

necrophiliac.

She was drunk, not dead.

I challenge.

Ok, fine. You're a narcissist.

Better.

You are a Nancy boy.

You are old.

You are odd...

...ly shaped.

(phone ringing) Hang on.

You are a parasite.

Not your turn.

Hello.

Ohhey, Judith. What's up?

What do you mean, what happened with Jake?

We had a nice weekend.

Well, we went iving, to the movies, um, ice cream.

Quack, rectal, suck-wad!

I never got my "P."

All you do is pee.

What? What? Uh, n-nothing.

Little... little word game. You know,

ercise the brain. Twit!

Turd burglar!

Judith, I-I-I don't know what Jake's problem is.

We had a terrific weekend.

Huh.

Jake says he doesn't want to come here anymore.

Really? Why?

I don't know.

Did he say why?

Charlie and I don't bicker.

I mean, no me than any other couple.

Of guys.

Right?

Right.

Oh, oh, !

You are a eunuch.

(sighs)

That's "E," not "U."

Learn to spell. Useless!

Look, I dot know what to tell you.

's a teenager-- he'll get over it.

Okay. Okay.

Bye-bye.

Well, I hope you're happy.

I haven't been happy in seven years.

For your information, I will not

have been here seven years until next fall.

Oh, good to know.

Circle the date on the calendar

so I'll know when to hang myself.

Ha, ha. Funny.

It-it's because of you Jake doesn't want

to come here anymore. Great.

Tell me what I did so I can do it to you.

(sighs)

God, you are such a...

What are we up to? "V."

Varmint!

You are a varmint.

Yeah, we...

you e a vagina.

You're calling me a gina?

No, no, no, no, no.

No, that's too good for you.

What you are is...

vagina adjact.

You know, for some women

this could be considered a hostile work environment.

Hey.

Isn't it past your bedtime?

I don'like to go to sleep angry.

Try drinking more.

What will that solve?

Sobriety.

We need to talk.

Oh, good.

I was so worried weren't going to talk.

I've been thinking.

Maybe Jake not wanting to hang out here

does have something to do with us.

I mean, we have been fighting a lot lately.

So?

So, don't you want him to feel comfortable re?

He farts at the dinn table.

How much more comfortable do we want him?

Charlie, if we don't figure way out to get along

there's a chance we might not see him anymore.

And the downside is...?

Come on, tough guy, you know you love him.

Why don't you just admit it?

Okay, I love him.

Now go tyour room and masturbate.

Already did, still can't sleep.

My point is, we have to work out our differences

for the sake of the child.

Are you out of your mind?

I mean, if it weren't for Jake,

we could just shake hands and walk away.

After what you've been doing,there'll b

keep Purell in my nightstand.

I'm not an animal.

Where is this going, Alan?

Well, I am glad you asked.

A Blueprint for Love?

It's a workbooJudith and I got in couples counseling.

But the principles can be applied

to any two human beings in a relationship.

I see.

So you did this right before e kicked your ass out

and took everything you own?

The principles are sound.

Judith is an unreasonable bitch.

Now, oka uh, the, um, the first exercise--

"Building a Foundation of Trust."

So, we eh say three things we admire about the other.

Uh, I will go first. Um...

I admire your sense of humor,

uh, your generosity

and your devil-may-care attude.

ank you.

Now, your turn-- three things yoadmire about me.

Three? Really?

All right, uh...

I like that you think I'm funny.

(laughs)

Good one.

Still counts, right?

Sure.

Two to go.

What did Judith put?

Okay.

Uh...

And...

yodisinfect your hands after you masturbate.

Thank you.

Now, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

Okay, next.

There's more?

Have we healed our relationship, Charlie?

I'm good.

and three things you would change about yourself."

This time u start.

Why would I want to change anything about myself?

You're kidding, right?

You think you're perfect?

In my way.

Oh, so you he no flaws?

Let us consider the hummingbird, Alan.

Or the butterfly.

All of God's creatureare perfect

just the way he made them.

Except you. You suck.

Okay. Okay, fine.

Name three things you would change about me.

Your personality,

Your voice,

your face, and again, your address.

All right... (anxious laugh) All right.

Your haircut, ur fruity little workbook

and your address.

Just... Just nded three.

Oh, come on, we're healing.

Your cheness,

your smug arrogance and your addre.

I'm leaving.

Hey, this thing really works!

* Men. *

The way you chew your food,

the hair in your ears and your address.

That stopped being funny a week ago.

Judges?

Still funny.

So where's the kid this wkend?

He's not coming, thanks to my broth.

Thank you, Charlie.

Sure, lay it l on me.

Nothing's ever your fault.

Hey, at least I was willing to work on our probls.

What, that stupi Blueprint for Love?

That was just an excuse to try to chan me.

You knew who I was when y moved in here.

That doe't mean you can't grow.

Why can't you gr?

Because you hold me back!

Stop it!

Can't you see yore tearing this family apart?!

Hah! What a couple of 'mos.

Look, can we at least establish some ground rules

about how we treat each other in front of Jake

Like what?

Like we agree that if there's something's bothering us

we wait and discuss it prively. Fine.

And no name-calling. Done.

d the sarcasm.

While you and I know

that our good-nared ribbing is all in fun,

Jake might perceive as hostile.

I hate you.

Exactly.

If Jake heard you say that, he'd think you reallmeant it.

I do mean it. I hate you.

nny. One of those things

I admire about you.

Now, come on, we'll get dressed and go talk to Jake.

You know, I just thought

ofnother thing I'd change about you.

Oh, yeah? at's that?

Your inability to accept my hatred.

And your address!

* Men. *

Hey.

He stillays he doesn't want to spend the weekend with you two.

You heard her, Al. Let's go.

Oh, stop it.

I'm serious. We don't need him.

I can pick my nose and wipe it on your car seat.

We'll talk to him.

Where is he? In his room.

How did you convince Alan you hated him?

What? He won't believe me.

ALAN: Charlie!

It's not like I can withhold sex, ke you did.

Ifou think of anything, text me.

Wow.

You are getting pretty good.

I'm just tuning it.

Well, tune on, broheim.

What are you doing here?

Okay, first of all,

your uncle and I would like to apologize

for our behavior last week.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

I've got nothing to apologize for.

Oh, really? So you've been just perfect

through this whole thing?

What can I tell you? I'm a hummingbird.

Shut up, Charlie.

I hate you, and you were adopted.

Your uncle and I understa

that we might have made you uncomfortable,

and we want you to know

that we're going to make a real effort to change.

When are you planning to sta?

Right now.

Right, Charlie? Yeah, sure.

So, you guys will stop fighting so much? ALAN: Yes.

Uh-huh. And you won't embarrass me in public anymore?

When did we embarrass you in public?

Oh, come on, you embarrass him constantly.

Uh, you don't? Hey, I'm the colorful uncle.

One day, he'll be telling his kids all kinds

of funny storiesbout me.

He'll be telling stories about me, too.

Yeah, to his court-appointed psychiatrist.

You know, u have got a cruel streak that is just ugly.

You want to know what's just ugly?

The schmuck who livesin my guest room.

At least I am not an aging pretty boy

desperately clinging oto the last dregs of his youth.

What are you saying, I'm losing my looks?

Oh, now you're worried.

Let me tell you something, pal.

Looks is all you've ever had.

No heart, no soul, no depth of character whatsoever.

Come on,e honest.

Which would you rather have?

My looks or those other three things?

You know what? Bite me!

I can't believe you actuly bit me.

Wait, wait!

I thought you were going to talk to him.

We did. He's still kind of upset with us.

You know teenage.

You just can't reason with them.

Oh, really? Wait right here.

I don't give a damn!

Weekends are the only peace I get around her

They're both losers!

Deal with it!

Now get your ass up and go with your father!

I'm driving.

I call shotgun.

Shotgun? What are you, a child?

Me a child?You just

(engine revving)

Hey, and don't rev it! You're wasting gas!

(engine revving)

Hey! Hey!

Hey, come back he!

Was he waving,

or did he justgive us the finger?

Both hands on the wheel!

10:00 and 2:00!

Okay. Okay.

That completes the "How to Disagree in a Loving Way" section.

I think we did very well.

I disagree...

but in a ling way.

Okayokay, next.

Um... things we have in common.

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh

Charlie.

Same last me. Same last name.

Oh! Very nice, very nice.

Drink?

Uh, yes, I am.

(grunts)

Okay, things we have in common, things we have in common.

Uh... Mom!

We both have the se mother.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

You're adopted.

Oh, right, right, right.

Okay, let's see, let's see.

Uh, what do we have in common?

Uh... Oh, oh, oh! Uh, here's one.

Um, we both feel unwort of love

and battle homosexual panic.

Maybe that's just me.

Maybe.

Mmm.

Okay, okay, here's one, here one.

Uh, we both ve Jake.

Oh, Jake.

Mmm.

Yeah, I love him.

ere is the little fartmeister?

I think he's sleeping.

Oh, he needs to know we love him.

You're right.You're right.

We d't tell him enough.

Come on, let's go wake him up and tell him we love him.

Mmm, good idea, good idea.

Jake!

Guess who loves you!

.......... ********** ..........

- Morning.
- Morning.

What you doing?

Saving a little money,
so Jake is brown-baggin' it.

Who am I kidding?

Breakfast of champions.

Type Two Diabetes Division.

Charlie's still in bed?

- You all right?
- Just a little back pain.

Oh, no.
Would you like me to take a look?

It's okay.

Chelsea, I'm a chiropractor.
This is what I do.

And you're like family now.

Which entitles you
to my family and friends discount.

All right.

You'll be the first one to use it.

I trust your insurance
is up-to-date.

- I don't think it covers chiropractic.
- Of course not.

Big insurance will pay
for an 80 yo man to get a boner,

but God forbid his spine is erect.

How long
have you been dealing with that?

On and off since I'm a teenager.

So, would this be around the time
you started to develop?

- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, as a woman.

Boobies.

I've always known that's a factor,
but what are you gonna do?

Well, I would recommend
that you get two adjustments a week

and ultrasound massage therapy.

We'll strengthen
your upper traps and rhomboids

so they can support
the load on your pecs.

Or, in layman's terms,

reinforce the door
that holds up the knockers.

You're staring.

It's okay, I'm almost a doctor.

Anyway, I've tried all that,
it didn't help.

There is one other option,
but it's kind of a last resort.

- What's that?
- Have you considered breast reduction?

Something's wrong.

Season 7 Episode 06
"Give Me Your Thumb"

Subtitle: Mr. Bo Jingles Team



You see, they reshape the whole breast
so you can't even tell.

- How long does it take to heal?
- It says just a few weeks.

You can keep Charlie off 'em
for that long,?

I don't know.
Might have to get some loaners.

That is not good porn.

It's not porn.

It's a website
about breast reduction surgery.

Alan, you don't need surgery.

A little exercise'll firm up
those man boobs.

Don't be silly.

Alan suggested it might be a solution
for my back pain.

Really?

Alan made that suggestion?

I just said it could help.

I'll tell you what helps pain.
Pain pills.

I saw a guy on the news
with a nail in his head,

and thanks to pain pills,
he was laughing.

What about addiction?

That's the least of his problems.
He's got a nail in his head.

Kidding, kidding.

I love your breasts
the way they are,

but if you're in pain,

you have my support to do
whatever you have to do to feel better.

Really?

You'd be okay with this?

Sweetie, come on.

If you knew the weight of my penis
was causing me back problems,

you'd be okay with me shaving off
a few inches, right?

I suppose.

I've learned to deal with that pain,
but that's my choice.

Thank you
for being so understanding.

- Don't thank me. I love you.
- I love you too.

I'm gonna go get ready for work.

I'll be up in a minute.

Charlie, I gotta say,
you handled that really...

Are you out of your freakin' mind?

My fingers!

What are you doing sticking your nose
in my fiancée's breasts?

- I was just trying to help.
- Let's make one thing clear.

The only acceptable boob reduction
in this house is you moving out.

Funny.

Please, Charlie...
I make my living with my hands.

Really?
Somebody's paying you to masturbate?

Also funny.

Don't I wish.

Now, please stop now.

I am duly chastised.

Not good enough.

- You need to be punished.
- What?

I'm giving you a time out.

What?

You've been bad

and you need to think
about what you've done.

- Fine, you want me to go to my room?
- Not far enough.

- Movies?
- Not long enough.

What, then?
I can't afford to stay in a hotel.

Here.

That's enough
for two nights in a nice hotel

or two months in an airport locker.

- I don't want your money.
- Fine.

Go sleep in your car.

Hold on.

I'll take a couple of bucks for gas,
that's it.

And meals, I have to eat.

Tips and incidentals.

That feel good?

Flavored oils.

This one's...

Apple cinnamon.

Nice.

- Want a lick?
- No, thanks.

You sure?

Tastes kind of like oily pie.

I'll pass.

Okay, more for me.

You know, I appreciate this.

But it's not gonna solve
my back problems.

Well, not right away.

But if we do this enough, who knows?

You might feel so much better,
you'll want bigger boobs.

I don't think so, Charlie.

Fair enough.
I want 'em bigger, you want 'em smaller.

So we'll compromise
and leave them the way they are.

I love
that we can talk these things out.

I made an appointment for a consultation
with a plastic surgeon.

What?

The more I think about it,
the more I think Alan's right.

Alan's never right.
Ask anybody.

He's like an idiot savant
without the savant part.

I hope you'll come with me
for support.

You can always count on me
for support.

I love you for who you are,
not the size of your breasts.

Thank you.

Of course it goes both ways,
you know.

One of these days I'm gonna need you
to love me for who I am.

Despite my old man balls.

Old man balls?

They get long, baby.

Don't throw away your D-cup bras.

We may be able to re-purpose them.

Hi, Mom.

Oh, Alan.

To what do I owe this unannounced
and inconvenient pleasure?

Just hoping to ask for a favor.

I see.

Tell me that there's a severed head
in that bag and you want me to hide it.

Nope, just socks and underwear.

How many pair?

Come on, don't make me beg.

All right.
You know where the guest room is.

Thank you.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

Not unless you want to talk
to my gentleman friend.

I was joking, Edgar.
Don't stop.

Good night, Alan.

Night, Mom.

Edgar.

Lord...

you've blessed me with a lot:

more money than I know what to do with,
a beautiful home,

and a surprisingly resilient liver.

You have truly given unto me
with both hands.

Which brings me to my request.

Of all the gifts
you've bestowed upon me,

none are a greater testament
to your glory

than Chelsea's heavenly breasts.

I don't know why you don't thrown
in a sturdy spine

so she could tote
those things around, but...

who am I to question your methods?

Anyway, you probably know
that she's thinking about tampering

with your great work,
and I was just...

hoping that you could, you know,

talk to her,

return her
to the path of righteousness...

and bodaciousness.

Amen.

Oh, one more thing.

Sorry we haven't talked recently,

but I had a little crisis of faith
after last year's Super Bowl.

Water under the bridge.

I got healthy on the NBA Finals.

Nice work with Kobe, by the way.

Looks like somebody missed
their period again.



So... where's Edgar?

He didn't stay tonight.

Kind of a booty call.

More like a dine and dash.

What'd you do
to piss your brother off this time?

Nothing. I suggested
that Chelsea's back pain

might benefit
from breast reduction surgery.

You suggested that Charlie's fiancée
get smaller breasts?

While you're at it,
why not try and reinstate Prohibition?

Anyway, Charlie and I have decided
to take a little break from each other,

so I'll only be here
a couple of days.

Oh, Alan.

I know I'm old to run home to mom.

Believe me, if I had money for a hotel,
I'd be there right now.

It's nice to know

that my investment in chiropractor
school was pesos well spent.

Hey, I think things are starting
to look up.

I'm at a real turning point,
career-wise.

You're an eternal optimist,
aren't you?

Yes, I am.

Oh, that just breaks my heart.

So, we'd make an incision here...

And here...

- And one more here.
- Oh, God.

Then we would remove
some fatty tissue,

reshape your breast
and relocate the nipple.

Oh, not the nipples.

I thought you were going to be
supportive.

I am being supportive.

I just didn't know we were going to play
Mr. Potato Head with our boobs.

They're not our boobs,
they're my breasts.

If we were to dust 'em for prints
right now, who's suspect number one?

I take it you're not entirely on board
with this.

No, no, no, no, I'm trying.

I don't want her to be in pain,
but come on, look at those babies.

They're perfect.

The only way you could improve on 'em
is if you could make 'em squirt money.

Don't worry.
They'll still be perfect when I'm done,

except that your fiancée
will be pain-free.

Hey, hey, I'm not questioning
your abilities, Doc.

In fact, I've been a big fan
of your work for years.

I mean,
when you make 'em freakishly huge.

Really?
You know my work.

Oh, yeah.

I have an lifetime membership
at the Pussycat Palace.

They named a pole after me.

You know, maybe it will help

if you get a better sense
of the end result.

Yeah.

This is Chelsea now.

That's about right.

And this is the size
I'm recommending.

- You got the one that goes with this?
- Sure.

Nah, what else you got?

- I made you a cup of tea.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

- Whatcha doin'?
- Finishing up some escrow paperwork.

Inspector found

no termite damage.

Sign here, sweetie,
where it says "inspector."

Is that legal?

Oh, don't worry about it.
There are no termites.

The mold killed them.

You have to cut corners
with the estate market the way it is.

True dat.

Initial here, here, and here.

- More termite stuff?
- The less you know the better, dear.

I was thinking
when we're finished with this,

we'd run over to Rodeo Drive
and do a little clothes shopping.

Rodeo Drive.
That sounds fun.

Do they have a Sears
or a Kmart over there?

Oh, don't worry about it.
It's my treat.

No, I'm a grown man.

I can't have my mom
buying me shirts, slacks,

boxer briefs
and possibly dress shoes.

You're my son. I want nothing more
than to see you happy.

And not dressed
like an unemployed lesbian.

Now, give me your thumb.

You've never been arrested,
have you?

Berta, these fish sticks are great.

Thank you. My secret is
I take 'em out of the freezer.

Well, kudos.

Where's my dad?

Damn it.

Pay up.

Thought for sure
he'd stay oblivious until Monday.

Well, "obliviously," you were wrong.

- Charlie, I talk to you for a minute?
- What's up?

Let's talk upstairs.

Sure.

Here's your cut.

No, you didn't do anything wrong.

Oh, cool.

So what's up?

You want a quickie?

No.

I got a call from the plastic surgeon
and they had a cancellation,

so they can squeeze me
in tomorrow morning.

Tomorrow?

But... that's so soon.

Why put it off?

Well, I was hoping we'd have time
to go away for a few days.

You know, one last fling,

just the four of us.

You've flung them plenty.

Come on,
just give me some more time.

- Time for what?
- Time to talk you out of this.

- You had to support me.
- Yeah, but when do I get my support?

- What are you talking about?
- This decision affects both of us.

I should get a vote.

You're not the one in pain.

Then why does it hurt so much?

Oh, you're just making it worse!

I love my new silk jammies, Mom.

It's like wearing a baby seal.

Well, I'm glad you like them, dear.

Oh, and I thought, tomorrow,

I could take you to my hair stylist.

Get you one of those hip,
new spiky looks.

That sounds like fun.

Although I'm only two haircuts away
from a free one at the barber college.

Oh, nonsense.

You deserve
to be pampered a little bit.

- I kind of do, don't I?
- Yes, you do.

I just have to be careful
not to make you too attractive.

I don't want to lose
my fella to another gal.

Your fella.

Funny.

Well, I'm serious.

You'll always be my fella.

And I'll always be your best gal,

right?

Okay.

And I've been thinking,

this is a big house.

And you and I are clearly not
the marrying kind,

so...

why don't you just move in?

- Here?
- Sure.

Why not?

Can't you see
how you and me are meant to be?

Well, we're meant to be
mother and son.

That's a given.

It's how we're livin'.

Very clever.

Of course,

there is a certain

financial imbalance.

But I'm sure
that we can come up with a plan

that meets both of our needs.

- Plan? There's a, there's a plan?
- Of course there's a plan.

I mean,
I'm a vibrant woman now, Alan,

but there will come a time
when I won't be able to fend for myself

and I don't want to pay
some stranger to dress me

and feed me
and carry me to the bath,

soap up a wash cloth and give me
a good, thorough cleaning.

Thanks, Mom! I'll call you.

That should keep him away
for a while.



- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
- I'm fine.

- Would you do me a little favor?
- What?

Go like this.

For old time's sake.

Chelsea?

- Ready for you.
- Oh, God, this is it.

Take a deep breath, Charlie.

I will if you will.

It's still gonna be me,
just a little smaller.

I know.

I guess the good news is it'll draw
more attention to your backside.

What?

You know, with your breasts smaller,

the eye will naturally
go to your ample tush.

Are you saying my ass is too big?

No, no, no, I love your ass.

I'm saying with smaller boobs,
more people will notice it.

Are you insane?
I don't want people noticing my ass.

Hey, hey, don't kill the messenger.
It's the first law of landscaping.

If you trim down the tree,
the backyard looks bigger. Am I right?

Damn you, Charlie Harper.

- What?
- Tell the doctor I changed my mind.

- What did I say? Where are you going?
- Home.

- And your back pain?
- I'll live with it.

- You sure?
- I live with you, don't I?

Come on.

How about that?

Thank you, Lord.
You speaketh through me.

Who wants more potatoes?

Hit me.

Uh, Chelsea, the way it's supposed to
work here is that Berta serves us dinner.

I don't mind.

Hear that? She doesn't mind. Shut up.

We're back!

Hey, how'd it go?

I don't know what you
were worried about.

Your son is a wonderful driver.

Oh, well, thanks for taking
him, Mom. He needs the practice.

Mmm, pork chops.

What are you wearing?

Grandma bought it for me.

Pretty cool, huh?

You made him dress up as a chauffeur?

He loves it.

Don't get grease on that jacket, dear.

Yes, Miss Evelyn.

Would you like to join us for dinner?

Oh, no, thanks, I had a late lunch.

And she sent a piece of pie out
to the car, so I could eat, too.

Anyway, I better get going.

Well, thanks again, Mom.

Say thanks to Grandma.

Thank you, Miss Evelyn.

Good to see you.

You, too.

Oh, I almost forgot.

Have you two set a wedding date yet?

No.

We haven't.

But we're gonna.

Well, it just so happens that a client of mine
schedules the weddings for the Bel Air Hotel,

and she told me that there was a
cancellation for the weekend of June 26.

The Bel Air Hotel?

In June.

Charlie, the Bel Air Hotel.

In June.

Yeah, I heard.

What do ya think?

Gee, I don't know. We
hadn't talked about a date.

Boy, it's almost impossible to get
a June date at the Bel Air Hotel.

Thank you, Alan.

Judith and I had to get married at the Sportsmen's
Lodge in November on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

Yes, I remember the Indian
corn centerpieces.

Oh, Charlie, I've always dreamed of getting married
at the Bel Air in the garden with the swans.

Yeah, but keep in mind
those birds are vicious.

They look pretty, but they'll
peck your eye right out.

Besides, I thought if we had the wedding here, the
money we save could pay for a nice long honeymoon.

Yeah, I guess that's probably smarter.

Shame on you, Charles.

Depriving your fiance?e
of her dream wedding.

Especially considering all the money you
blew on hooch and whores over the years.

Thank you, Berta.

Tell you what-- the wedding at
the Bel Air will be my gift to you.

Are you serious?

Gee, Mom, thanks, but that's
a little too generous.

A little?! All she gave Judith
and me was a dinette set.

Yes, and who's eating
on that dinette set now?

That's not the point.

Charlie's marriage is just
as likely to fail as mine was.

Thanks again, bro.

Anyway, I asked them to
hold the date for 24 hours.

So you can talk it over and decide.

Thank you, Evelyn. That is so sweet.

Well, I do have an ulterior motive.

The sooner you two get married, the
sooner I'll have more grandchildren.

Why? Does Miss Evelyn need
a cook and a butler, too?

Let me know, dear.

I will.

The Bel Air Hotel.

In June.

Let's see ya get out
of this one,Houdini.

So, have you thought
about your mother's offer?

Yeah, I have.

I've got one question.

Why June?

What's wrong with
getting married in July?

Or the following October?

October is a perfectly good month.

Birds all fly south, so you don't
have to worry about swan attacks.

Charlie, if you don't want to get
married in June, we don't have to.

What? No, no.

No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

Where do you get this stuff?

So?

So, what?

Do you want to get married in June?

Oh, we're back on that.

Well, I can't think of
any good reason why not.

And believe me, I'm trying.

So that's it?

We're getting married June
26 at the Bel Air Hotel?

I guess so.

Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy.

That's only because you don't have
a swan beak in your eye socket yet.

I'm going to go call your mom, and
then my mom and then all my friends.

Good, good.

Alan, we're going to do it.

June 26 at the Bel Air Hotel.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

That's so wonderful!

I know! I gotta go call everybody.

Congratulations.

Thanks.

Wow, the end of an era.

Guess so.

Well, you had a good run.

Yep.

But now it's over.

Forever.

Nothing's going to change, Alan.

Sure, I'm going to be married, but I'm still going to be
the same guy living in the same house with the same woman.

Yes, yes, the same woman.

Forever.

Hey, can I be the best man?

You'll need a sex change.

Where you going?

Out for a drink.

You can drink here.

I could, but I don't want to vomit here.

Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.

Why?

I'm not done poking at you.

Hey, shouldn't you ask the
ol' ball and chain first?

I don't need her permission.

Really?

Yes, really.

Although, it is considerate to let your
partner know your plans, so she won't worry.

Sweetie, I'm going out for
a drink with Alan, okay?

Sure! Have fun!

Thanks! Love you!

Shut up.

You're driving.

Jake has one big-ass head.

All kidding aside, she's a great girl and
I'm sure you're going to be very happy.

Thanks.

Forever.

Are you done poking?

For the moment.

Boy, who would've figured that of the two of
us I'd end up being the carefree bachelor?

If by carefree, you mean broke and
lonely, everybody would've figured.

Charlie.

Betsy.

I'm getting married on June 26.

Good for you.

At the Bel Air Hotel.

Nice!

That means no matter how easy
you are, I can't sleep with you.

I can. I'm Alan.

Can he buy you a drink?

What you watching?

Golf!

Don't sneak up on a guy, all right?

Sorry.

Your dad watches a lot of golf, too.

So, listen, how'd you like to
be a groomsman in the wedding?

What do I gotta do?

You just walk down the aisle with one of the
bridesmaids and stand with Charlie during the ceremony.

Tell me more about the bridesmaids.

They're friends of mine.

So, they're old.

No, not all of them.

I have a niece who's about your age.

Is she pretty?

I think she's cute.

Okay, I know what that means.

She's not a brainiac, is she?

What does that mean?

Well, I don't like 'em stupid, but I
don't like 'em talkin' down to me either.

Got it.

And I like a little junk in the trunk.

You won't be disappointed.

All right, I'm in.

Great.

You know, of all the women my
uncle's been with, you're my favorite.

Oh, thank you.

And there's been a lot.

I know.

A whole lot.

Right.

Like, I'm betting around a thousand.

And that's just since I've been
old enough to pay attention.

No kidding.

When I first got here, he told me that
they were coming over to water the plants.

And I believed him.

What did I know?

Sure. You were young.

And naive, too.

We didn't have any plants.

And there were some crazy ones, too.

I'll bet.

Your niece doesn't have a license
to carry a concealed weapon, does she?

No.

Good.

You should've seen where
this one girl hid hers.

Come to find out that what I thought was
a boil on my neck was actually a carbuncle.

Lovely.

Little known fact, uh, carbuncles
are technically in the boil family,

but they take way longer to drain.

Charlie, help me here. I'm dying.

No, you're doing fine.

Tell her about your hemorrhoids.

Please, I'm begging you.

All right.

No sense letting my
superpowers go to waste.

So,Dr. Harper, are we still going to Sun
Valley in your Gulf Stream this weekend?

You own your own trailer?

No, no, no, that's an Airstream.

Dr. Harper has a private jet.

Really?

Oh, yeah. He needs one for his work.

What do you do?

Uh, I am a chiropractor.

A chiropractor without borders.

He travels the world adjusting
the backs of starving children.

Yes, you... you have to be, uh, very careful, um, because
their little bones are very brittle.

You're amazing.

Nah, it's just my job.

You're amazing.

It wasn't tough.

We had her at trailer.

Uh, another round. On him.

Charlie...

Charlie?!

Go away, Alan.

I really think you need to wake up now.

Chelsea's sleeping.

Perhaps, but not here.

Okay, what the hell is your prob...

Oh, dear.

What happened?

I don't know.

Who is she?

I don't know.

What the hell do you know, Alan?

I know we're in a strange
woman's bed, together, naked.

Let's get the hell out of here.

Good idea.

Do you remember anything?

Well, I remember we were in Pavlov's.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You
were hitting on some chick.

Guess it worked.

Do you happen to remember how I did it?

Alan, focus.

Okay, right, right. I-I think there was
something about a-a trailer in Sun Valley.

Are we in Idaho?

No mountains, no snow.

Why are you wearing my underwear?

Why are you wearing mine?

Oh, boy.

Let's just go.

Should we leave her a little note?

What?!

You know, a thank
you, maybe my phone number.

Are you crazy?! Just keep moving!

But she's cute, and I'm gonna
need a plus one for your wedding.

Oh, my God, my wedding.

You're right, it could be awkward.

What have I done, Alan?

Less than 24 hours after I set a date for my
wedding, I wake up in bed with another woman.

And me.

You woke up in bed with me, too.

What the hell did we do last night?

I wish I knew.

What am I gonna tell Chelsea?

Well, let-let's think. I mean, maybe
there's an innocent explanation.

Oh, really? And what might that be?

- Okay, clearly, we all had a bit much to drink.
- Yeah.

And you and I, being
gentlemen, escorted the lady home.

She invited us in for a
cup of coffee to sober up.

Was that before or after
we switched underwear?

Let me finish.

Uh, so, we went into her apartment and...

I don't know what you're
gonna tell Chelsea.

Here is what you tell her.

Tell her you were detained by the secret
police, strip-searched and water-boarded.

Just drive.

Worked for me.

All right.

Here's what we're gonna do.

We're gonna forget this
night ever happened.

Good idea.

Giddy-up
horsey, giddy-up.

Of course, that may be
easier said than done.

Great. No one's up yet.

All right, go to bed.

I'll see you later.

Charlie?

What?

You want your boxers back?

You keep 'em.

Really? Gee, thanks.

Oh, oh, Charlie?! Charlie?

Yeah?

Uh, if I put 'em in the laundry,Berta
will wash them and give them back to you.

Then hand-wash 'em.

Of course.

Charlie?! Charlie?!

What?

Woolite or a mild detergent?

I don't care.

All right, no worries.
I'll check the label.

Oh, Charlie?

What?

Thanks for taking me out with you
tonight. I had a really good time.

Charlie?

Yeah, babe?

Are you just getting home?

No, no... no, I was a little drunk, so
I slept downstairs for a while.

I didn't want to disturb you.

Did you have a good time with Alan?

Oh, come on, it was Alan.

How much fun could I have had?

Happy birthday Mr. President

Happy birthday To you.

Oh, you don't mean that.

No, no. We had an okay time.

Pretty forgettable.

I talked to my parents last night.

They are so excited.

Not as excited as me.

I'm gonna make you a
great wife, Charlie Harper.

I know.

And I'm gonna... cut
down on my drinking.

Boy, I don't know, Chels.

I really like the white
roses for the centerpieces.

You don't think it's too much?

No. No. The rose symbolizes love, and white
symbolizes, you know, the cleanness of that love.

Cleanness?

Yeah, yeah, like purity
or... untainted by filth.

A white rose is a rose you can trust.

And making it the centerpiece is
appropriate because you're mycenterpiece.

You know, the piece that
supercedes all other pieces.

Are you still drunk?

Only with love.

Oh, it's my grandmother.

Hi,Grammy!

Yeah, it's gonna be a June wedding.

Excuse me.

That's a terrible thing to say,Grammy.

Besides, I said "June," not "Jew."

Okay, what've you done?

Beg your pardon?

That sweet, naive hick you're marrying might buy
this loving, cooperative attitude, but not your mommy.

Hey, can't a fella just be
excited about floral centerpieces?

A gay fella.

You're feeling guilty
about something. What is it?

Nothing. I've got nothing
to feel guilty about.

Okay, okay, okay, now you
give him your underwear.

Charlie...

I'm not really sure what I did.

So, a drunken escapade?

Is there another kind of escapade?

Well, whatever you do, don't
tell Chelsea about it.

Confession may be good for the soul, but
it's a hot lead enema to a marriage.

I know, I know, but I've got these freaky
memory flashes, and I feel so guilty.

Trust me... those memories
will fade with time.

How do you know?

Let me tell you a story.

Many years ago, when I was married
to your second stepfather...

The carpet king?

Well, I called him that.

Wasn't his occupation.

Anyway, he was away on business, and you and your
brother were in summer camp or somewhere, and I...

Well, I was lonely, bored
and the circus was in town.

And when I woke up in that Motel 6, clown
makeup smeared all over my bosom, I was alone.

The Chinese acrobats, the strong man and the
little people had moved on to the next town.

Oh, my God!

What did you do then?

Well, what could I do?

I showered, plucked the
sequins from my hoo-hoo...

held my head up, got on with my life.

And you never told the carpet king?

No, of course not.

I loved him too much.

Your second stepfather was the third
best thing that ever happened to me.

Behind me and Alan?

Sure.

I think some teenagers are fooling
around under the deck again.

Really?

Yeah, I found a pair of men's
briefs by the side of the house.

Damn kids.

No respect for anything.

Listen, Chels... we need to talk.

Something wrong?

Yeah.

What is it?

I got these... these
pictures in my head,

and I'm afraid if I don't tell you
about them, they're gonna drive me crazy.

Go ahead.

Well, what happened was...

my second stepfather went on a business
trip while the circus was in town.

Alan and I were at camp-- or
someplace-- and my mother was lonely.

Should we leave her a note?

just keep walking

Ask your doctor
if it's right for you.

So, do either of you guys
urinate with abnormal frequency?

I mean, you gotta define abnormal.

And keep in mind the body
doesn't process alcohol efficiently.

Which is why your uncle Charlie
is a perpetual urine machine.

Also keep in mind that your father

has the bladder control
of a frightened nine-year-old girl.

Which is why he needs to wear
two pairs of undies and a panty liner.

Only on long drives.

Really?

- How many times a night do you pee?
- Just once.

- I can hear your toilet flush.
- Okay, four times.

But at least
I get out of bed to pee.

That was an isolated incident.

I was dreaming my shoes
were on fire.

That answer your question?

And remind me
to never ask another one.

- Why aren't you ready?
- Ready for?

You've got to be kidding me.

I've told you we're having dinner
with my girlfriend Gail tonight.

Excuse me, gotta pee.

You never listen
when I'm talking to you!

It's like you just tune me out.

You look like you're paying attention,
but your mind is a million miles away.

Do I need to pee?

Nah.

I mean, I could.
Might be traffic.

Probably should pee.
Yeah, better pee.

We're gonna be late,

and I'm gonna be embarrassed
because you don't listen.

Boy, she's got great boobies.

Season 7 Episode 08
"Gorp. Fnark. Schmegle."

Subtitle: Mr. Bo Jingles Team

So, Charlie, I've heard
so many nice things about you.

Really? From who?

Hello.

Oh, right. Thanks.

I only hear the complaints.

- You don't hear anything.
- That's not true.

You're right.

He hears what he wants to hear.

So I'm right.

- Well, you still make a great couple.
- Thank you.

And I'm really looking forward
to your wedding.

I'm sure it's going to be beautiful.

What'd I do?

Nothing. I told you
she's going through a bad breakup.

- When did you tell me that?
- In the car, on the way here. God!

- It's gonna be okay.
- I know. It's just hard.

I thought I knew him.

I thought we were going to be together
forever, like you and Charlie.

Hard to believe
somebody got tired of doing her.

French fries look good.

Why did I order the baked potato?

- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

Is this the one
who's the old college roommate?

I should really listen more.

I mean, I knew he was insensitive...

Boy, I bet, if they were roommates,
they did some experimenting.

Why is it that girls can experiment
with other girls and not be gay,

but if a guy so as much
kisses another guy...

Bad memory.

Drink, drink, drink.

So you're just all alone
in that big apartment?

He even took the dog.

- Bastard.
- What? It's my first drink.

Not you.

Brian took Rufus.

Who's Rufus?

For that matter, who's Brian?

Life of Brian,
that was pretty funny.

Brian's song, not so much.

James Caan was great in it, though.

That's 'cause he's a great actor.

The Godfather, Rollerball...

I can so see these two
kissing in a dorm room.

That's really sweet,
but I couldn't impose.

- We insist. Right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

You'll stay with us for a few days
and heal.

- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

Good.

After dinner, we can go
to her place so she can pack a bag.

Absolutely.

You'll love Charlie's place.
It's right on the sand.

Very quiet, restful.

Dear Penthouse forum...

I always thought
your letters were made up,

until my fiancée's college roommate
came to stay with us for a few days.

- Right, Charlie?
- Absolutely.

Be right there.

What's up?

What were you doing?

Shaving.

- At night?
- Well, not so much shaving as trimming.

So, how was dinner?

Forget dinner.

- Tell me you weren't using my razor.
- Mine doesn't have the floating heads.

I don't believe you!
I put that thing on my face.

I was gonna clean it.

I don't want it back!

- Really?
- Yeah, it's yours.

Merry Christmas.

Thank you.

This is a stocking stuffer, right?
You're gonna get me a real present, too.

A real present?

Well, you obviously
didn't put much thought into this one.

- Good night, Alan.
- Good night.

I almost forgot.
Pack up your stuff and get out.

Okay,
the razor can be my Christmas present!

No, no, no, Chelsea's girlfriend
is staying here for a few days,

so you sleep on the couch.

Put her in Jake's room
and have him sleep on the couch.

Go trim your ball hair
with a steak knife.

I feel bad kicking
your brother out of his room.

That's only because
you don't know him.

Here we go.

A little chamomile tea,
help you sleep.

Chelsea, I can't thank you enough.

Don't be silly.

I know what it feels like
to have my heart broken.

Me, too.

You know, theoretically.

- I'm grateful to you both.
- And we're grateful to you.

You know, theoretically.

Anyway, tomorrow, you can sleep in,
take a nice, long walk on the beach...

I've been
a really good boyfriend tonight.

Chelsea
should do something nice for me.

Like make out with Gail.

I put fresh sheets on the bed.

- Alan, this is my friend Gail.
- Gail, this is Alan.

I'm so sorry
to put you out like this,

- but your brother said...
- Gorp.

Fnark. Schmegle.

Oh, god,
I've been waiting for you all my life.

Marry me. Have my children.

... it's really
very generous of you.

Come on, I'll show you the room.

Chels, you in there?

It's okay, Charlie. Come on in.

- Everything all right?
- She's pretty upset.

I'm sorry I'm such a basket case.

Please. We're here for you, baby.

Right, Charlie?

Absolutely.

I guess I'll...

leave you two alone.

You don't have to go.

I don't?

Not unless you want to.

Come on, Charlie.

We all know
what you really wanna do.

We do?

We do.

Come here. Join us.

So...

What now?

Do I really need to tell you?

We'd probably be better off
if you did.

I want you to make Gail happy.

And you're on board?

It was my idea.

Don't worry,
she and I have done this before.

In college.

I knew it.

Let's turn that frown upside down.

That's a good boy.

- Hey, Chels?
- Yeah, babe?

This is a dream, right?

Of course it's a dream.

I'm really gonna let you sleep
with my best friend?

Well, in that case, hang on.

'Cause I'm gonna do
some real freaky stuff here.

Excuse me.

I brought you
some fresh towels, Gail.

Aren't you sweet.

Sure, sweet.

Go smell his room.

Morning.

Good, you're up.

I made you some toast.

- Here's your orange juice.
- Thank you, honey.

I'll see you later.

Wait, you're leaving?

I told you I have to go in
to work today.

- But what about Gail?
- She can take care of herself.

I think she's already made
a new friend.

Yeah, I saw.

You don't think
he's got a shot, do you?

Charlie, you're horrible.

I was joking.
So how long are you gonna be gone?

I'll be home for dinner,
I may pick up some chinese food,

- and we could stay in and...
- Is she nuts?

I can't be trusted alone
with that chick.

Wait, maybe this is a test.

A trap.

The two of them are in cahoots
to find out if I'll make a move.

Cahoots,

that's a funny word.

Sounds like an owl sneezing.

Ca-ca-ca-cahoots!

- So, I'll call you later.
- Absolutely.

Morning, Alan.

Morning.

Thank you again for the room.

Don't be silly. Happy to do it.

Mi casa, her casa.

It's actually his casa,
but the dehumidifier

and the night-light belong to me.

Still very nice of you.
See ya later.

What you got going on today?

Gonna play a little tennis in 1958?

This old thing?

This is just
my knock-around clothes.

So, what's the story on Gail?

- Bad breakup?
- Something like that.

So, she's on the rebound.

- Where you going with this, Alan?
- Nowhere, I'm just curious about her.

And, you know, when we met last night,
I sensed a little spark between us.

If there was a spark, it's only
'cause she was warming up her taser.

Very funny.

Trust me, the only way

you're gonna hook up
with someone like her is in your dreams.

Already did.

Really? Was Chelsea there?

No! Good lord!
How creepy would that be?

Regardless, forget about Gail.

Potato head out there
has a better shot than you do.

I've got a nephew about your age.

You should meet him.
He plays guitar, too.

Maybe you guys could jam sometime.

Boobies.

For your information,
there is a good chance

that a woman like that is tired of rich,
handsome, successful guys

who have their own homes
and recently built cars.

You really believe that?

I have to.

Who's that?

Chelsea's friend.
She's going through a bad breakup

so she's gonna stay here
for a few days...

Too bad I prefer the fellas.

Then again,
I can always draw a moustache on her.

Alan?

Jake?

Berta?

Oh, boy.

Although,
maybe this is another dream.

Gail, you okay?

I'm fine.

Good. Good.

I'm going to run some errands.
Can I get you anything while I'm out?

A reason to live.

All righty.

Coming in.

Sorry.

I just got some bad news.

What happened?

My boyfriend...

Rufus?

That's my dog.

Oh, yeah.
He's okay, right?

He's fine.

I just found out Brian
is already seeing someone else.

No.

I mean, we just broke up and he's
already sleeping with another woman?

The pig!

I thought we had something.

He always said I was his soul mate

and that he wanted spend his life
with me.

This can't be a dream.

She's still got her clothes on.

And she's talking.

Why can't I find
a nice guy like you?

Absolutely.

Maybe Chelsea
would let me borrow you.

Excuse me, gotta pee.

Oh, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

I don't know if I can hold out.

I hear you.

- What?
- Nothing.

I gotta get gail out of here
before I do something I'm gonna regret.

You know,
after I thoroughly enjoy it.

Tell her to leave.

I can't do that.

She's Chelsea's best friend.
They were college roommates.

Really?

You think they experimented?

Oh, yeah.

I gotta figure out a way
to get gail to leave on her own.

You got the perfect tool
for the job.

What are you talking about?

The one tool that's guaranteed
to drive any woman out of your house.

Hello.

Oh, look, it's an Allen wrench.

- What was that about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

I was telling Berta
that maybe I was wrong

about you not having a shot
with gail.

Why? Did she say something?
Did she ask about me?

How would you feel a double wedding?
As long as you're paying for one.

Slow down, slow down.
Nobody said anything.

I just realized I might've been jealous
'cause she's so beautiful

and if I can't have her,
I didn't want you to have her either.

Yeah,
I was thinking it might be that.

Anyway, it's not fair for me
to stand in the way of your happiness.

Really? I always thought
that was one of your favorite things.

You want to pick nits
or to go talk to a beautiful woman

who's extremely vulnerable and may
very well be looking for revenge sex?

I don't want revenge sex,
I want a loving relationship

that has depth and meaning
and that will withstand test of time.

Oh, that's good.
I'd lead with that.

- You think?
- Oh, yeah, go get her.

All right.
All right. Wish me luck.

You don't need luck.

You've got the exact skills need
to get this job done.

Thanks. You're a good brother.

If he actually gets laid,
I'm going to hang myself.

Come in.

- Hey, there.
- Hi, Alan.

You... up for a little company?

I guess.

You know, it does get easier.

The wound does heal.

I know. Thank you.

It may not feel like it now,

but before too long, you'll forget all
about that fella who hurt you, 'cause

another fella will be in your heart.

A fella who'll never hurt you.

Who'll never leave your side.

A fella who wants nothing more than

- to love you...
- Oh, dear god, no.

Thanks for your hospitality, Charlie.
I should get back home.

- Anytime.
- Where'd we leave it?

- I'll call you, you'll call me?
- I'll call you.

So...

How'd it go?

You heard her.
She's gonna call me.

Shame on you, Alan Harper.

You knew that Gail
was going through a difficult time.

What do you do?
You try to take advantage,

- to exploit her vulnerability...
- What is it about an angry woman

that I find so hot?

Even when that fat cashier
at the supermarket was yelling,

I got a little engorged.

Boy, if I could just find somebody
like Chelsea.

I mean, look at her go.

She's a real fireball.

Speaking of fireballs,

next time I manscape I should
probably skip the aftershave.

.......... ********** ..........

That was great.

Good, I'm glad.

Wait, wait, wait, you're glad?

I knew it.

There was no "gaa."

"Gaa"?

When the sex is working for you,

you try to say "God",
but it comes out "gaa."

And this time, there was no "gaa."

No "gaa," no good.

And I'll tell you another thing.

You usually grab my ass
like you're holding

a tree trunk in a hurricane.

Now, it was like you were

palming a couple of cantaloupes
at the supermarket.

Fireworks don't have to go off
every time for me to enjoy it.

Please, fireworks is the whole point
of the exercise.

Otherwise, all you've got
is two people humping on a stairmaster.

Sometimes it's nice
just being close.

Nice being close.

Great.

Now I know what it's like
to be my brother.

- Would you stop it?
- No, this is the beginning of the end.

First our sex life goes to hell,

then we start eating dinner at 4:30,

watching reruns
of Dr. Quinn, medicine woman,

and at 9:00 we shake hands,
pee and go to sleep.

Then around midnight
I get up to pee again.

Quit making such a big deal
out of it.

Just because once in a while
I don't have an orgasm...

Wait, wait, wait!

This has happened before?

A few times.

Why didn't I know?
Were you faking it?

- Does it matter?
- You're damn right, it matters.

Why'd you stop?
Don't you love me anymore?

Of course I do.

If you really did,
you'd keep faking it.

Fine, from now on I will.

Too late.

Now I'm on to you.

Honey, there's nothing
to get so upset about.

I've just been working really hard,
under a lot of stress.

Then on top of that,
I'm trying to plan our wedding

and dealing with my parents,
your mother.

But trust me,
as far as I'm concerned,

you're still the sexiest man
on earth

and I'm the luckiest woman
who ever lived.

Lucky, lucky, lucky.

Season 7 Episode 09
"Captain Terry's Spray-On Hair"

Subtitles: Mr. Bo Jingles Team



Aren't you taking
your girlfriend out for dinner?

If I eat first, I won't pig out
in the restaurant and make her sick.

Good idea. You'll have
the rest of the night to make her sick.

Exactly.

Plus I won't snap at her
if she reaches for one of my fries.

All right, Chelsea'll be home
in a few minutes.

How we doing?

The wine's decanting,
pasta's on the stove,

salad's in the fridge,
Marvin Gaye's on the CD player.

Gay.

And what about this?

- Where's this gonna be tonight?
- It has a date.

Eating first.

- I taught you well.
- Thank you.

Clean underwear?

Cleanish.

Not good enough!
With underwear, there's no gray area.

Don't worry, it's not gray.

Anything but white is unacceptable.

I'd better change.

And take off the bib!

If he can score just once before I die,
my life will have been worthwhile.

Then you might want to start
eating healthier.

- What's the big occasion tonight?
- There's no big occasion.

Just trying to keep the fire going
with Chelsea.

You know what's good for that?
Doing it in public.

Really?

There's nothing like the thrill
of thinking you might get caught.

You almost walked in on me
a couple of times.

You're kidding.

Just a heads-up, the next time you see
the sparkletts' truck parked outside

avoid the garage.

From now on, I'm gonna avoid water.

Good news, Alan.

You're going to the movies tonight.

Blame it on the Bossa Nova

With his magic spell

Blame it on the Bossa Nova

That he did so well

- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

- What is that?
- That's hairspray.

Really? Hairspray?
Let me see it.

No. Leave me alone.

- What's the big deal?
- It's not a big deal, go away.

I need you out of the house tonight
to be alone with Chelsea.

- Don't worry, I have a date.
- Another Internet hook up?

Suavesingles.com.

First month's free.

Must be how they keep out
the riffraff.

- Have fun.
- Thank you, I will.

Captain Terry's spray-on hair.

"Guaranteed to cover bald spots."

It's not a bald spot.
I'm just getting thin on top.

So you're painting your head?

It's not paint.

It's a specially formulated
hairlike substance

designed for the active man
on the go.

You poor, gullible bastard.

- It gives me confidence.
- Okay, fine.

But what happens to your confidence

when your date runs her fingers
through your...

Specially formulated
hairlike substance?

It's guaranteed
"not to smear, drip or ignite

"under normal circumstances."

You're gonna spend the rest of your life
spray-painting your head

like it's a freeway underpass?

This is just a stopgap
till the pills kick in.

- What's this, like propecia?
- Better, stronger.

From eastern Europe where they don't
worry about all those FDA regulations.

There's a monkey on the label.

It is not a monkey,
it's the inventor.

- How long have you been taking these?
- A couple of weeks.

It has to build up in your system,
and then stand back and grab a comb.

Far be it for me to judge someone

for taking
questionable pharmaceuticals,

but be careful with this stuff.

Do you think I'm so vain
that I would jeopardize my health

to grow a little hair?

Need I remind you about the Japanese
penis enlargement system you bought?

That is not what caused the rupture.

I'm sorry, but this is a monkey.

So...

did you make your way
around the mountain?

Excuse me?

You know,

- were you driving six white horses?
- What are you talking about?

She'll be driving six white horses
when she...

Are you asking me
if I had an orgasm?

Yeah, but I'm trying
to be cute about it.

No, I did not.

But it doesn't matter.
It was wonderful.

- Were you at least close?
- Yes, I was close.

That's a start.

When you were close,
what was I doing?

Getting a beer.

I'm kidding.
Can we please just drop it?

Excuse me
for trying to bring you back to "gaa."

Sex is not just about orgasms.

Really?

Then how are we supposed to know
when we're done?

- Don't pout.
- I'm not pouting.

Yes, you are.
Your bottom lip is sticking out.

It's swollen.

You could've stopped at any time.

I am not a quitter.

Do you know
what the best part of tonight was?

For you or me?

'Cause I think mine
was pretty obvious.

It was that you cared enough
to plan this amazing evening for me.

The beautiful dinner,
wine on the deck,

the two of us talking,
just being together.

It's nights like these
that make me realize how lucky I am

to have found the man I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

Lucky.

I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

your bangs
are dripping down your face.

A little lesson for you.

There are two things
you never wanna buy on the cheap:

canned hair and condoms.

I'm assuming
it never got to condoms?

No, it did not.

Once my hair started dripping
on her chicken Marsala,

the evening was pretty well shot.

I probably should've sprung
for Captain Terry's hair sealer.

Maybe you'll have better luck
with the monkey pills.

Thanks for reminding me.

If the date was so bad,
why are you home so late?

I've been at the emergency room
having my eyes flushed.

Apparently, my hair
contains small particles of fiberglass.

What the hell's he doing?

Trying to sneak in
two hours after curfew.

Aren't you gonna punish him?

Maybe tomorrow.

It's hard to assume
any moral authority

with Captain Terry's specially
formulated hair all over my face.

True.

You do kinda look like
a hot fudge sundae.



Didn't see you there.

That's the first time
anyone ever said that to me.

Taking a lunch break?

Sure, let's call it that.

- Mind if I ask you a question?
- It's Liz Taylor's White Diamonds.

- What?
- My fragrance.

You can get it at Costco.

Nice.

It's a great stocking stuffer
for Christmas.

- I'll remember.
- I'll act surprised.

Actually, I was gonna ask you
about when you were married.

Which time?

- What was the long one?
- Jerry.

14 years.
God rest his soul.

- He's dead?
- He better be.

When Jerry walked among us,

was there a time
when he wasn't, you know,

doing it for you?

You mean
even though he was doing it to me?

Well, sure. But that's natural.
Passion always fades over time.

Before you know it,
you find yourself daydreaming,

barely noticing the naked guy
with the bad mullet

and the flip-flops
doing his dirty business on top of you.

God, no... I never let Jerry on top.

He was like
a fur-covered water heater.

So that's it?

That's all I have
to look forward to?

A wife that has to go to a happy place
every time I have sex with her?

Is Chelsea complaining?

Can you read her mind?

Then don't worry about it.

How can I not worry?
Orgasms is one of the few things

I bring to the table
in this relationship.

I can't argue with you there.

But maybe
this is the perfect opportunity for you

to become a better boyfriend,

a more compassionate,
caring individual.

Or you could buy her
one of them vibrating eggs.

They're awesome.

I heard.

I gotta go.

Man, I hope I can hold on to this buzz
until the sparkletts' guy gets here.

Alan, you in here?

Bathroom.
Getting ready for a date.

Another suave single?

No, my free trial expired.

Now I'm on J-Date.

Alan, we're not Jewish.

Who cares? You should see
these girls... Very hotsy-totsy.

And the best part is,
till my hair pills kick in, two birds

with one stone.

So, how can I help you?

Well... Believe it or not, I wanted
to ask your advice about women.

Me? I'm flattered.
What do you want to know?

- Well...
- Sit, boychick.

Okay, I'm having a little problem,
you know,

satisfying Chelsea in the bedroom.

So I thought to myself,

who knows more about not satisfying
a woman than my brother Alan?

That's a very unfair
characterization...

but not entirely inaccurate.

Go on.

My question is...

How do you live with yourself?

How do you wake up in the morning
and not drag a razor across your throat?

Well, that's not an easy question
to answer.

First of all,
I don't own a straight razor.

This is what happened with Judith?

Actually, Judith was always
highly orgasmic.

- Really?
- Not with me, of course.

As long as I don't let the battery
get empty, she was one happy Shiksa.

So, how did you deal with that?

Didn't it make you feel like less
of a man?

Okay, I understand.

Your problem is, your male ego

is tied
to your partner's sexual pleasure.

Your self-esteem
is almost entirely based

on whether or not she achieves
some level of physical satisfaction.

You got to get past that.

- What, you're saying I shouldn't care?
- Charlie...

Our people have spent
thousands of years

carrying the burden of guilt.

I say enough!

It's time to break the shackles.

Okay, first of all,

I'm pretty sure
that our people are Scotch-Irish.

Perhaps.
But the Talmud teaches us

that the true worth of a man

is in his good works
and devotion to god.

- The Talmud?
- Yeah, I googled it.

Figured I might need a little
Jewish dinner chat.

I did some research... I was planning
on taking this girl to red lobster.

Meshuggah, right?

I got to go.

Listen, Jake's grounded
for coming in late last night,

so be a Mensch and keep an eye
on the little Pisher?

Oy...

vay.

This is fun, huh?

I guess.

Gin.

Damn. Okay.

Let's go again.

You do realize that at a certain point
we're going to have to go to bed.

I know. It's not like
I'm avoiding it or anything.

Really? 'Cause this is the first time
since I've known you

you've suggested we play a game
that doesn't involve money or nudity.

We could play for money if you want.

What do you say, penny a point?

We'll go to bed
when someone's up a hundred bucks.

Come on, are we gonna talk
about the elephant in the room or not?

What's there to talk about?

I can't ring your bell anymore,
so we'll grow old,

I'll die, and you'll find happiness
with a vibrating egg.

You ever stop to consider
that maybe this isn't about you?

No, not really.

- Well, it isn't.
- Then what's it about?

It's personal.

What's more personal
than bumping pee-pees?

All right, fine.

My ex-husband's getting remarried.

I'm sorry, are we still having
the same conversation?

I know it sounds stupid, but...

ever since I found out,
I somehow felt shut down.

Why?

I don't know, I guess
'cause he's moving on with his life.

But you're getting married, too.

Yeah, but I'm getting married
because I'm over him.

He's getting married
because he's over me.

Wait a minute.
Are you still in love with him?

Of course not, you idiot...
I'm in love with you.

Good, good,
because I'm sure feeling loved.

I'm sorry.

Let me make sure I'm following this.

Knowing that this guy
is getting married

has gotten in the way of you
having an orgasm.

Maybe.

I think so.

Boy, women.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, nothing.

It's just I once had an orgasm
with a lawn dart in my foot.

- You think I'm crazy?
- No, no. No.

Having sex over the hedge from where
kids were throwing the lawn darts...

That was crazy.

And believe it or not,
I do understand.

- You do?
- Sure.

No one wants their former lovers
to be happy.

- They don't?
- Hell, no.

Most of my former lovers
want me dead.

A couple have tried.

In fact,
now that I know you have a vengeful,

petty side, I love you even more.

Thanks... I guess.

Don't worry about the sex.
It'll work itself out,

just like the lawn dart.

- I love you, Charlie.
- You should.

I'm being really sensitive
and understanding and all that crap.

Now, how about another game?

All right.

I got to tell you.

I'm kind of relieved to find out
I'm not the problem.

Neither of us is the problem.
It's just that I have feelings.

Okay, for me,
that would be a problem.

You do realize
that Jake snuck out of the house.

He's grounded.
How else is he gonna leave?

Hey, how about the winner
of the next hand

gets to be sexually satisfied
without any guilt or reciprocity?

- You have a good hand, don't you?
- No, not at all.

- All right, it's a bet.
- Gin.

Okay, I got to ask.

Was that a real "gaa,"
or a mercy "gaa"?

Oh, that was the real thing.

So, it was good?

Lawn dart good.

You know what I think?

The fact that you shared your feelings
with me, and I really listened,

made the sex more intimate

and helped you overcome
whatever was inhibiting you from...

That's just rude.



Morning.

Morning.

Hey, looks like your hair
is really filling in back there.

Yeah, I think the pills
are starting to work.

What?

ANNOUNCER (over TV): You don't have to be a prisoner of depression.

Unlock the door of darkness and despair,

and step into the sunlight with Lumitrol.

If you're taking an MAO inhibitor,

consult your physician.

Side effects may include dry mouth,

high fever, tremors, nausea, sweating...

You should try that stuff.

What for? I'm not depressed.

Really? Why not?

What have I got to be depressed about?

Well, you've been divorced twice,

you're living on your brother's couch,

and your only child is flunking tenth grade.

Wh-you... you're flunking tenth grade?

When the hell did this happen?

Easy, dude. I think you

got bigger things to worry about.

CHELSEA: Charlie, you're being a complete ass about this.

CHARLIE: I said no. End of discussion.

Yeah, that'll do it.

It's just a couple of dance lessons

so we don't look like idiots at our wedding.

Hey, I have said yes to everything

having to do with this stupid wedding,

but this is too much.

You think our wedding is stupid?

If I have to dance, it is.

You know what, just drop dead.

Fine.

I'll drop dead, and you can dance on my grave.

You do know you're going

to be taking dancing lessons?

Oh, yeah.

Does that depress you?

A little.

May I suggest you try Lumitrol.

What?

Unless you're already taking an MAO inhibitor,

in which case, consult your physician.

Hard to believe he's flunking tenth grade.

Hey. Hey.

Did you cave on the dancing?

Yeah.

You have to grovel?

Like a leper at a kissing booth.

Did you at least get makeup sex?

Nope.

Wow, it's like you're already married.

Yeah, I might as well just give her my testicles right now

and use the empty sack as a man purse.

Hey, hey, don't knock the man purse.

Terrific way to carry your keys,

ChapStick, sunblock, moist wipes.

Please move out of my house.

Hey, face it, big brother.

We're a team.

Like Ernest and Julio Gallo.

Seriously, get some cardboard boxes,

fill them with your crap and go.

Now, see, that's just misdirected anger.

You're not mad at me; you're mad at yourself

for trading your dignity and self-respect

for security, peace of mind and regular sex.

Where do you get that?

I've been married twice, Julio.

The key is to make the best of it.

Uh, like with the dance lessons, for instance.

They... they can be fun.

You and Chelsea practicing,

learning to glide across the dance floor

as a single organism,

embracing the music like the breath of life itself.

Okay, first, decorate my house, then move out.

Cute. You'll see what I'm talking about

on your wedding day when you step out

onto the dance floor with your new bride

and sweep her into your arms with everybody watching.

I'm sorry. I can't see it.

Let me help you.

* Precious and few are the moments *

* We two can share...

How'd you know that's the song she wants for our first dance?

Who do you think suggested it to her?

Okay.

Let's see what you got.

What? Dance with me. Come on.

Are you out of your mind?

I'm just going to give you a few tips.

Keep your tip away from me.

You can either embarrass yourself now

or you can embarrass yourself at your first dance class

in front of Chelsea and a bunch of strangers.

Okay, I just want you to know

I'm only letting you touch me

'cause I'm half in the bag.

Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that.

Now, put your right hand on my lower back.

And your left hand holds my right hand.

Okay.

Whoa, whoa!

We're not cracking walnuts.

Firmly but gently, like you hold a baby bird.

I've never held a baby bird.

Okay, like you hold a boob.

I am holding a boob.

Ha ha.

Now, we're going to start with a simple waltz.

You're the boy, and I'm the girl.

That's how it would break down in prison.

I don't know, Charlie.

You've always been the pretty one.

And...

one, two, three, two, two, three.

One, two, three,

two, two, three.

Okay, you're going to have to back off a half step.

There's no groin contact in ballroom dancing.

Huh.

Wonder if that's why they call it "ball room".

Man, your grandmother really did a number

on those poor bastards.

It's a miracle I turned out as well as I did.

Hey, Uncle Charlie, want to dance with me?

Hey, Jake, want to live in a foster home?

Sometimes.

Don't sass me, boy.

I'll take the switch to you.

Hello, man of my dreams.

Hello, love of my life.

Hello, reason I go to therapy.

You go to therapy because you're weak.

I'm weak because you broke my spirit at age five.

Oh, boo-hoo for you.

Guys, guys, can we please not do this?

What?

Just saying hello.

I'm going to go put this stuff away.

Thanks again for the scarf.

My pleasure, dear.

Looks beautiful on you.

Thank you.

That woman is just a treasure.

I know.

Worth her weight in gold. Yes, she is.

Speaking of which, have you talked to her about a prenup?

What?

No, I'm not going to ask her for a prenup.

Charles, 50% of all marriages end in divorce.

And guess which half the guys

who can't keep it in their pants fall into?

Hey, I have never once cheated on Chelsea.

How long have you known her?

I don't know-- about a year and a half.

How long do you plan on being married?

Criminy, I need a prenup.

And...

Very... nice, two, three.

You're doing great, sweetie.

Have you been practici

No, no, no.

I'm a musician.

It's instinctive.

So, the pictures Jake e-mailed me

of you and Alan cheek to cheek was jut,

a tender moment between brothers?

How old do kids have to be

before it's legal to punch them?

Come on.

You'd never hit Jake.

That's exactly what I want you to tell Child Serves.

I think it's great that you cared

enough about this to practice.

So, I get some points in the bank?

Whole bunch.

Good. Good.

Speaking of the banks, I've been thinking.

Now, don't overreact,

but maybe we should start talking about,

you know, the possibility of getting some kind of a--

what do you call them?-- prenup.

Sure.

You want your lawyer to draw it up or mine?

INSTRUCTOR: Now switch partners with the couple to your left.

Hello.

Hi.

Are you two getting married?

Yeah.

That's wonderful.

It took me 38 years

to get my husband to dance with me.

Well, better late than never.

He's only doing it now 'cause I caught him

banging our church organist.

Wow.

Want to help a nice lady give a little payback?

Switch!

Hi. Missed you.

Me, too.

So, you were saying you're okay with the prenup thing?

Yeah. In fact, I was trying

to figure out a way to bring it up.

Really? Why were you going to bring it up?

Well, I just think it's smart

for both of us to protect our property.

What property do you have?

Um, not a lot.

Just a little real estate.

Real estate?

No big deal.

Just a few apartment buildings.

Buildings?

INSTRUCTOR: And switch!

Keep walking, pal.

When were you planning on telling me you own buildings?

Um, I didn't think it was that important.

Well, it's important enough for you to want a prenup.

Hey, you're the one who brought it up.

Yeah, but I'm not hiding anything from you.

You know everything I've got.

A house on the beach, a car in the garage

and a worthless douche in my guest room.

What about all the royalties from your music?

Yeah well, uh...

you've got buildings.

Just three.

Just three?

Why are you getting so upset?

I thought I knew you.

I had no idea you had some secret life as a slumlord.

I'm not a slumlord.

Two of the buildings are in the marina,

and one's in Brentwood.

Oh, my God, that's even worse.

Why?

We've been together almost two years.

Would it have killed you

to pick up a check once in a while?

Switch!

Hello again.

EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

for the first time as husband and wife,

Mr. and Mrs. Alan Harper.

* Now I've had the time of my life *

* No, I've never felt like this before *

* Yes, I swear it's the truth

* And I owe it all to you

(high-pitched): * 'Cause I've had the time of my life *

* And I owe it all to you...

Hey.

How was dance lessons?

Want to know how dance lessons were?

I'll tell you how dance lessons were.

Chelsea wants a freakin' prenup!

Just 'cause you dance like a middle-aged white guy?

I'm not middle-aged.

Oh, sorry.

You. You're middle-aged.

I'm younger than you.

You're also broke,

losing your hair and sleeping on my hide-a-bed.

Always gotta bring a gun to a knife fight, don't you?

What the hell are you watching?

It's my wedding video.

No kidding. Where am I?

In the coat room banging Judith's sister.

Oh, right.

Wish you had that video.

So why does Chelsea want a prenup?

Apparently she's got three fancy apartment buildings

she doesn't want me to get my hands on.

Really? Anything I could live in for free?

You know, house-sit,

building manager in lieu of rent.

How did this become about you?

Fine, I'll stay here.

Oh, good. I was worried.

The point is, Chelsea's been keeping a secret from me.

Well, maybe she just wants to make sure that you loved her

for herself and not her property.

Oh, so I don't even get the choice?

I would think that you would be happy.

This means she's financially well-off

and doesn't care about your money.

Which makes me trust her even less.

What?

Alan, think it through.

If she's not interested in my money,

then why is she marrying me?

I have no idea.

Exactly.

We may have to consider the possibility

that Chelsea's insane.

I see your point.

She look like she's sorry?

Yeah.

Sorry she ever met you.

Hey, Chels.

Hello, Alan.

Brr.

My nipples just got hard.

Yeah, well, too bad.

She deceived me and she doesn't trust

that our marriage is going to last.

Aren't you the one who wanted the prenup in the first place?

That's different. How is that different?

Because when I brought it up,

I thought I had more stuff than her.

Okay, let me get this straight.

You're upset because you're marrying a woman

whose only character flaw

is that she happens to have her own money?

I knew you wouldn't understand.

* So we take each other's hand

* 'Cause we seem to understand *

* The urgency

* Just remember

FEMALE VOCALIST: * You're the one thing

MALE VOCALIST: * I can't get enough of...

That's the last time she ever moved her pelvis like that.

So, are we going to talk,

or you're going to sit there pretending to read?

I'm not pretending.

If I didn't know how to read,

I would've told you a long time ago.

I wouldn't have deceived you.

Don't be such a child.

I'm the child?

You're the one who's been keeping secrets.

Wasn't really a secret.

I would've told you if you'd asked.

Oh, really?

So it's my fault that I didn't ask you

if you're a land baron?

What else should I be asking you?

Were you born with a penis?

Is this your home planet?

Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

No, no, no, what I'm being is committed to this relationship.

Really? You're committed?

Yes, and I've jumped through hoops to prove it to you.

What hoops? Dancing lessons?

No, not dancing lessons.

Yeah, okay, dancing lessons.

And meeting your mom, and being nice to your friends,

even all the ones that don't like me,

and letting you put these stupid throw pillows on my bed.

Did I ever complain about that? Constantly.

And yet here they are.

With your frilly curtains

and your girly lamps.

It's like living inside the I Dream of Jeanie bottle.

So I'm supposed to be grateful

because you've behaved the way a fianc?is supposed to behave

towards the woman he loves?

Oh, yeah.

Okay, I see.

Now you're going to turn it around on me.

Make me the bad guy.

Where are you going?

I'm sleeping on the couch.

In my house.

Which you know I own

because I bragged about it the first night we met.

Alan.

What? What-what's wrong?

Chelsea and I had a fight.

Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

You want to talk about it?

I just did. Now go sleep on the couch.

Wait, if you and Chelsea had the fight

why do I have to sleep on the couch?

You ever hear of crap rolling uphill?

Now get out.

You know, just using the word "please"

would go such a long way with me.

Fair enough.

Please get out

before I pull your pajama bottoms up so far

you'll be wearing your balls as a bolo tie!

There, was that so hard?

I'm sorry for keeping a secret from you.

Is there any way I can make it up to you?

Okay, I would be remiss...

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

You let me lay down naked on top of you!

I didn't know it was you! I thought it was a dream

and then when I realized it was you, I didn't know what to say

and you're so soft and warm and... (groans)

Oh!

Oh, I deserve that.

What the hell's going on in here?

Your brother's a pervert!

You woke me up to tell me that?

I came down here to apologize for keeping a secret.

It was dark, and I thought it was you under the covers,

so I laid down naked on him and he let me!

You let Chelsea lie naked--

Wait a minute. You came down to apologize?

Yes.

So, you're saying I'm right and you're wrong?

Yes. You're right.

Excuse me, I didn't quite get that.

Do you want to gloat or do you want to come upstairs

and let me make it up to you?

Ooh, make up. I choose make up.

Come on.

Right behind you.

You sick freak. (high-pitched scream)

Still worth it.

But eventually, Alan's bed-wetting stopped.

At least I hope it did for the sake of the honeymoon.

Unless, of course, you're into that kind of thing.

To Alan and Judith.

Mmm!

And now...

I'd like to introduce the best man,

although I consider him to be a bitter disappointment,

Alan's brother Charlie.

Charlie?

Charlie?

Charles!

Coming!

What's going on?

You're making a toast to your brother and his bride.

Oh. How am I doing?

Just make the toast.

Okay.

Can I throw in a word about the bride's sister?

No.

Got it.

Well, just FYI, that word would've been "nasty."

Don't look at me like that, Judy.

Your sister's a freak.

* She's a super freak

* Super freak

* She's super freaky

* Super freak, super freak

* She's super freaky... Unbelievable.

.......... ********** ..........

* Men. *

* Oh, the weather outside
is frightful *

* But the fire is
so delightful *

* And since we've
no place to go *

* Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow. *

Snow, sleet, rain, sun,

you've still got
no place to go.

(in Dickensian accent):
Which is why I'm grateful

for your generosity,
Mr. Scrooge.

Speaking of generosity,

check out what
I got Chelsea.

Diamond earrings.
Nice.

Yeah. She dropped
a couple of hints

about stuff she wanted.

But I wasn't really listening,
so I got her these.

How romantic. Will she be
joining us for dinner?

I think so.

She's out doing some
last minute shopping.

Or something with work, again,
I wasn't really listening.

Why did you mail me
a letter?

Oh, I decided to send out a
Harper Christmas Newsletter.

You know, keep everybody
updated on all things Harper.

You're kidding.

(in Dickensian accent):
Don't worry, governor,

I didn't mention your
ongoing battle

with the demon rum.

(sighs)

"As this wonderful year
draws to an end,

"I send this note
to family and friend.

"So thankful are we
for blessings galore.

"Like Charlie's fiancÃ©e--

a lady, not a whore."

Keep reading.

(sighs)

"And young master Jake is
growing like a weed.

He makes us all proud,
not a waste of my seed."

Keep going, keep going.

"He tried his darnedest
in every class.

And made tenth grade
by the skin of his ass."

And, see, I put in
a little drawing

of an elf with
his pants down.

What the hell's
the matter with you?

You're a grown man.

Oh, come on, people
love this stuff.

Read, read.

(sighs)

"And our sweet mother Evelyn
had a small operation.

Her secret garden needed
rejuvenation."

Secret garden?

Find a rhyme for vulva.

I dare you.

(sighs)

"And what about the author
of this Christmas poem?

"He's healthy and happy
in his beautiful home.

"And while some might argue
that he's just a leech,

it bothers him not,
he lives at the beach."

"Happy Holidays
from the Happy Harpers."

What do you think?

You're sad, pathetic,
lonely and blue.

If I gave a rat's ass,
I'd worry about you.

(with pirate voice):
Expecting rough
weather, Captain?

What?

(normal voice):
What you looking at?

Uh, nothing.

Really?

So the beautiful girls
playing volleyball

completely escaped
your eye?

I see 'em, you perv.

The little hottie
in the tank top is
checking you out.

I know.

Now please go away.

Why don't you go
down there and
talk to her?

I can't.

Why not?

I got a girlfriend.

Oh, buddy, you can't
call the posters in
your room girlfriends.

No, I'm talking
about Celeste.

I'm in a committed
relationship.

What are you talking
about? You're 13.

I'm 15.

Who cares?

You're too young for
a committed relationship.

I'm 40 and I'm
barely ready.

You're 42.

What is it with you
and numbers?

Let me ask you something--

where is Celeste
right now?

She's spending Christmas
with her mom in Brentwood.

So what, your life
just stops when she's gone?

That's the deal we made.

Listen to me, if you want
to go talk to the beach girl,

you've got every
right to do so.

Are you sure?

I don't think so.

Don't worry about it.

Just go talk to her.

Can I borrow ten bucks?

Why?

If she shoots me down,

then I can go buy a
couple corn dogs.

She's not going
to shoot you down.

Yeah, but now I got
a taste for corn dogs.

Just go.

What if she wants
a corn dog?
She's about to meet one.

Now get out of here.

Do I look okay?

Jake, she waved
at you. She smiled.

Clearly her standards
aren't that high.

Right. Thanks.

When did I turn 42?

Son of a bitch.

Hey, I'm an organ donor.
Good for me.

* Men, men, men, men, manly men,

Hey, Berta, merry Christmas.

Thank you, Charlie.

You're very generous.

Well, I just want you to know

that I appreciate
all your hard work.

And I appreciate you pretending
I work hard.

Hey, you feeling lucky?

What do you got in mind?

My Christmas bonus--

double or nothing that Zrbnck
makes the field goal.

Are you crazy?

That's 52 yards.

He hasn't made one
that long all year.

I got a hunch.

You got a bet.

ANNOUNCER:
There's the snap.

The kick is up.

It's long enough,
but wide.

It's no good.

Zrbnck's missed another one.

Well, happy birthday, Jesus.

Told ya.

No biggie.

Easy come, easy go.

Sorry.

Looks like the grandkids
are getting

beef jerky and Lotto scratchers
this year.

Here.

You're too kind.

Don't mention it.

You got a big heart.

Thank you.

Double or nothing
they don't make
the first down.

Hey.

Oh, hey. Where you been?

Out on the beach.

So, how'd it go?

Fine. I'm getting
her a grape soda.

No, no, no, no, no.

You don't bring the grape soda
to her.

You bring her
to the grape soda.

Her who?

Hang on.

You bring her here.

She sees your beautiful house.

She thinks you've got
it going on,

and then you've got a shot at...

Well, I don't know what you got
a shot at, but you got a shot.

Whoa, whoa, catch me up.

Do you see what I'm saying?

So I should bring her here?

Absolutely.

Women love this house.

It's an aphrodisiac.

I don't think
she's afro anything.

She's more like Chinese.

Wait, who's Chinese?
What's going on?

He met a girl on the beach
and I'm helping him out.

What about Celeste?

Uncle Charlie said my life
shouldn't stop just 'cause
she's not around.

So you're encouraging my son
to cheat on his girlfriend?

Oh, come on, there's
no cheating going on.

Are you cheating?
I'm not sure.

You're not cheating.

Yes, he is.

How would you feel if Celeste
was somewhere right now

flirting with
some other guy?

How do you know she's not?

She's with her mom.

And you're with your dad,

but that's not stopping
you, is it?

Good point.

No, no, it's a lousy point.

Relationships are built on
trust and mutual respect.

Oh, grow up.

Relationships are built on
diamond earrings and Viagra.

Now go take the young lady
her grape soda.

I still think it would help

if I had some corn dog money
to flash around.

Go.

Shame on you.

What's the big deal?

It's not like he and
this Celeste girl are
sleeping together.

No, no, but I think that
once a relationship reaches
any physical level,

there's an implied
commitment.

Yeah, that's because
you married the first girl

who touched your wiener.

Not true.

The first girl who touched my
wiener was Maxine Chernakoff.

And she refused to marry me.

As did the blind girl
at camp, the school nurse

and crazy cousin Wendy.

* Men.

I hope you're
proud of yourself.

I'm more proud of him.

I mean, he actually
got her back here

without hitting
her over the head

and stuffing her
in a burlap sack.

Pretty girl.

Yep.

You'd think she'd have
more self-esteem.

Hey, Jake may be dull-witted,
but he does have

a certain je ne sais quoi
with the ladies.

Well, maybe six years of picking
his underwear up with a rake

has made me immune
to his charms.

Hey.

Hey. Nice work talking her
into coming back here.

I didn't really talk
her into it.

She had to pee.

Yeah, but you gave her the
grape soda that made it happen.

Now, Jake, you're
just hanging out

with this girl, right--
as friends?

So far.
What does that mean?

It means I haven't
made my move yet.

What move?

I'm not sure.

That's why I haven't
made it yet.

Anyways, I don't think
it's going to get serious.

She doesn't even live here.

She doesn't?

No, she's just in town
for the holidays
visiting her aunt.

She pronounced it "awnt,"
but I figured it out.

Oh, dude, you have
hit the jackpot here.
I have?

This girl is most likely
looking for a hot story

to tell her friends
back home,

and you, you cute, little,
clueless bastard,

can be the star
of that story.

Really?

Yes, so stop
wasting time.

What are you even
doing in here?

I had to fart, and I didn't want
to do it in front of her.

Attaboy. Good thinking.

I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

(doorbell ringing)

Oh, that must be Mom.

Mom? What's Mom doing here?

Well, it's Christmas Eve,
Charlie.

I know. Why isn't she out
stealing toys in Whoville?

Merry Christmas,
one and all.

Hello.
Hi, Mom.

Boys, this is the
legendary TV producer

Mr. Marty Pepper.

Hi.
Hello.

(loudly):
Marty, these
are my sons,

Charlie and Alan.

Is it important
which is which?

Not really.

Would you help me
with the wheelchair?

I'll call you Scooter.

And you, uh, Dutch.

Uh, Mom...

are, uh, are you
and he, um...?

Oh, good Lord, no.

The man is 1,000 years old.

It's a wonder his scrotum
doesn't get tangled up
in the wheels.

So he's just a friend?

Yes.

And I just couldn't let him
spend Christmas Eve alone--

rattling around his
25,000 square foot

Beverly Hills mansion,
with adjoining guest house,

Olympic size saltwater pool
and home theater.

There it is.

Are you really this
hard up for a listing?

Alan, it's a $60-million home.

My commission will be
almost $2 million.

How much did you make last year?

Welcome to our home,
Mr. Pepper!

What are you shouting for?

I'm incontinent, not deaf.

Sorry.

What?

Have an Abba Zaba, Marty.

Thank you.

Did I ever tell you
I knew Lucille Ball?

Yes, you did, dear.

You know, she wasn't
a real redhead.

Ask me how I know.

Warning: it's dirty.

(clicks tongue)

Uncle Charlie, I think Celeste
knows I'm seeing another woman.

What? Why?

She's texting me.

What are you talking about?

Nothing, nothing.

Jake has a shot
at some out-of-town strange.

You see how he is
corrupting your grandson?

Come on, Alan.

It's out-of-town strange.

Do you really have a shot?

I don't know.

Uncle Charlie seems
to think so.

Tell her you wanna get her
her own sitcom.

Never fails.

(text alert plays)

There she is again.
What do I do?

Just text her back,
"Thinking of you."

Which you are,
so you're not lying.

Good, that's good.

Okay, this may be your house,
but this is my son.

Yeah, and you've been living
here seven years,

which makes us a common-law
couple, which makes him our son.

Homos with a kid.

A great idea for a sitcom.

(text alert plays)

It worked.
She wrote back,

"Merry Christmas,
I miz you."

Then write back,
"I miz you, too."

Man, you are good.

Look at that.

Our little boy is growing up.

How would you feel about us
having another child?

(piano playing
"Jingle Bell Rock")

* Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock *

* Jingle bells swing
and jingle bell ring *

* Snowing and blowing up
bushels of fun *

* Now the jingle hop
has begun *

* Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock *

* Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time *

* Dancing and prancing
in jingle bell square *

* In the frosty air

* What a bright time,
it's the right time *

* To rock
the night away *

* Jingle bell time is
a swell time *

* To go glidin' in
a one-horse sleigh *

* Giddy-up, jingle horse,
pick up your feet *

* Jingle around the clock...

Alan?

* Mix and mingle
with the jinglin' feet *

Alan?

* That's the jingle bell,
that's the jingle bell... *

Alan?!

40 years ago you asked for a
little brother for Christmas.

Happy?

* That's the
jingle bell rock! *

Could somebody move me?

My chestnuts are roasting
by this open fire.

Is that you?

I thought Alan
burned the ham.

Berta, don't you wanna spend
Christmas with your family?

Do you wanna spend Christmas
with yours?

Let me freshen your drink.

What is that fragrance
you're wearing, my dear?

Ben Gay and foot powder.

Whatever it is,
it's making me hot.

Turkey's almost done.

Aren't you gonna put on
some nice clothes?

Why? It's just
gonna be you, me,

Chelsea, Berta, Mom

and the ghost of showbiz past.

And Jake.

No, Jake split.

What?

He's hangin'
with his new girlfriend.

Where?

Her aunt's house.

I think they got
the place to themselves,

so he might get
a little, you know,

peace on Earth tonight.

How do you make everything
sound dirty?

Hey, I took
the high road.

I coulda gone with
"Come, all ye faithful."

(sighs)

He needs to be home.

Oh, come on, Alan.

He's got a real shot
with that girl.

I don't care.
It's Christmas Eve.
So?

So if I can't get laid,
nobody gets laid.

Yeah, Jake,
this is your father.

Whatever you're doing,

I want you to stop it
and get your ass home.

What's he doing?
Is he decking her hall?

Shut up!

Right now, mister!

Fine, bring her back here
if you want.

Yes, there's
still pie left.

(doorbell rings)

What are you lookin' at?

How would you like
to have your own sitcom?

Hi. Is Jake home?

Um, I don't know.

Sorry to intrude,
but Celeste wanted

to give Jake
his Christmas present.

Please come in.

Aw, crap.

Wow, check out the mom.

Forget the mom.

We gotta get
rid of 'em

before Jake walks in here
with another girl.

Yeah, yeah, good idea.

Uh, hi, hi. I'm, uh, Alan,
Jake's divorced father.

Keisha,
Celeste's mother.

Her mother?

Oh, please, you look
like her sister.

You're sweet.

And single.

Where's Jake?

Uh, um, uh, uh...

Actually, he's, uh,
distributing corn dogs

to the homeless tonight,

But we'll make sure
he gets your gift.

Thanks for stopping by.

Merry Christmas.

Jake?

Oh, hi.

Who's this?

Um... I don't know.

Who's she?

Uh... Uncle Charlie?

I don't know what
to tell ya, pal.

It happens.

You said you didn't have
a girlfriend!

He doesn't!

Would you like
some eggnog?

You've got to be kidding.

You want some pie?

You are such a liar!

Why all the yelling?

What's going on?

Uncle Charlie
just ruined my life.

What?

He said it was okay

to see other girls as long as
my girlfriend wasn't around.

Really?

Is that what you believe?

No, no, not at all.

He completely misunderstood me.

Merry Christmas!

Yeah, right.

Nice going.

Would you like a lick?

Not of that.

* Men.

You want to take
your hand off my leg?

I certainly do not.

Love you.

Yeah. Who do you love
when I'm not around?

Hey, Uncle Charlie?

You really suck,
you know that?

Yeah, I've been told.

Listen, Jake, would it
be creepy for you

if I called Celeste's mom?

Are you insane?

Think about it.

Here you go, sweetie,
bite-size, easy to chew.

Marty?

Oh, God! Marty?

Ha, just messin'
with you, ya vulture!

She thinks she's gonna sell
my house when I'm dead,

but I ain't goin'.

Oops.

Actually, I am goin'.

Merry Christmas, everybody!

.......... ********** ..........

So what time
is your flight?

8:00 a.m.

8:00 a.m.?

Wow.

Yep.

You want me to drive you?
That'd be nice.

So what time you think
we should leave, around 6:00?

To be on the safe side.
Sure, sure.

You never know with traffic
and airport security and all.

Would you rather
I call a cab?

No, no. No, I won't hear of it.

I'll call one for you.

Golly, I'm gonna miss you.

A couple days without
sex won't kill you.

It's not just sex.

You're my friend,
my companion.

And what makes you think
I'm not going to have sex?

Excuse me?

Hey, when the cat's away,
the mice masturbate.

Tell you what,

why don't you open
a bottle of wine,

come upstairs and I'll
give the mice something
to remember me by.

Oh, yay, fresh memories.

Much better than the video
of you on my iPhone.

You took video of me
on your iPhone?

Well, I...

Just a little.

I'd have asked permission,
but you were kind of busy.

Give me the phone.

Aw...

Give it.

Thank you.

Oh, Charlie!

What? You can't even tell
it's you.

I can't turn my back
on you, can I?

Actually, I have photographic
evidence that you can.

Not anymore.

Aw...

Don't pout.

Just get the wine
and come upstairs.

Okay.

And leave
the phone down here.

Aw...

Let's see, what's the proper
wine for the occasion?

Ah, who cares? Everything goes
with ass biting.

Hey.

Thought you were on a date.

I was.

It didn't go well.

Really? You're usually
such a hit with the ladies.

This might have been
the worst date of my life.

Did she dress you in
a leather bustier

and tie you to a bed?

No.

Did she Super Glue a model car
to your balls?

No.

Did she talk you into putting on
one of Mom's dresses

while she stole your wallet?

No.

Well, then this wasn't even
your worst date this month.

I suppose.

And thanks for the
highlight reel, by the way.

Happy to help.

I feel like going down
to the beach

and diving into the ocean
and swimming out

until my arms are so tired that
I sink below the waves

into blessed oblivion.

Hold on. Before you
do anything crazy,

can you help me get
this bottle open?

Sure. I mean...

these women you meet online--

you think you have
some kind of a connection,

you know, a bond,

and then you meet them
face-to-face

and there's nothing.

Just two lonely strangers
staring at each other

across buffalo wings
and soft-serve ice cream.

Well, maybe your problem
is taking them to a mall
food court on a first date.

Well, excuse me, but I don't
want to make a big investment

until I have a sense
of where things are going.

Plus, the parking
is free.

Here you go.

Thank you.

Okay, well, good catching up.

If you're going for that swim,

make sure you tuck
your driver's license

in your crack so I can
identify your body.

I mean, is it so much to ask
to make a connection with
another human being?

No, it's not.

I'm not even looking
for sex. I just want a
little companionship.

That's rough. Buy a dog.

You said I couldn't have
a dog in the house.

Fine. Buy a dog and move.

You know what would be great?

If you could find a dog
with its own house.

What's taking
you so long?

Oh, hi, Alan.

How was your date?
Awful.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to talk about it?

No. He's going
for a swim.

Well, I-I could use
a friendly ear.

Of course. Now tell me, this
is the girl you met online?

Uh-huh. "Perky Dodger
fan in Tarzana""

So what happened?
First of all, she wasn't
so much perky as porky.

More like a Dodger Dog fan.

Don't you hate it when people
misrepresent themselves?

I do. When someone
makes a date with

"Buff Malibu doctor,"
that's just what they get.

(indistinct conversation)

Apparently,
even when the cat's here,

the mice have to masturbate.

Hey.

Hey.

Watching some football?

No fooling you.

Who are we rooting for?

The spread.

Ah, so we're making
an illegal wager.

Technically.

Don't get me wrong,
I'm not judging.

It's really a victimless
crime, don't you think?

So far.

Sorry.

Heard any good
jokes lately?

Yeah.

Two brothers are
sitting on a couch.

One of them says,
"Heard any good jokes lately""

And then the other one--

get this-- the other
one lights him on fire.

Okay, we'll just
watch the game.

Thank you.

All right, it's
a commercial.

Now you can talk.

Well, I was thinking,
with Chelsea out of town...

Hold on, hold on, it's that
baby that trades stocks.

I love this kid.

(chuckles)

Look at this...

Okay, go ahead.

I was thinking, with Chelsea
out of town,

that maybe, you know,
after the game...

you and I could go out
and grab a bite to eat.

No, thanks.

Not hungry?

Don't like you.

Oh, come on,
I need some human contact.

(doorbell ringing)

That's probably a human.

Go contact them.

That was clever.

I'm a clever guy.

Well, hey, buddy.
You're here early.

Oh, I was thinking,
that if you're hungry,

you and I could grab
a bite to eat and...
(door closing)

Maybe later.

He's been a little crabby
since his girlfriend dumped him.

The kid's a stone-cold
bummer, Alan.

Okay, well, thanks
for dropping him off.

You're welcome.
Oh, hey, Herb,

by any chance, do you want to
go out and maybe grab a bite?

Really? You and me?

Sure. Why not?

That's kind of weird, isn't it?

I mean, you're the ex-husband,
I'm the current.

So we've got
something in common.

We do, don't we?

Right.

Neither one of us is
having sex with Judith.

(laughing)

That's actually a little
too close to home.

Sorry.

So what do you think?

I could eat.

Let's go.

Uh, you ever been
to Kabob Kingdom?

At the food court?
I love that place.

(sportscast playing)

Hey, Berta, would you
grab me a beer?

Sure.

Jake, grab your
uncle a beer.

Let him get it himself.

Sorry. I tried.

Hey, numbnuts, just take a beer
out of the fridge

and bring it over here.

Fine.

Here.

Thank you.

What's with the attitude?

You're the reason
Celeste broke up with me.

You still grinding on that?

Yeah, I'm still grinding on it.
I love her.

Stop it. You love fart jokes
and pie.

Fart jokes, pie and Celeste.

If you hadn't talked me into
hanging out

with that other girl,
I'd still have all three.

Oh, come on, pal.

At your age, relationships
aren't serious.

They're just, you know,
puppy love.

No, no, this wasn't puppy love.

This was... dog love.

Trust me, you have not had
dog love yet.

I don't even think your father's
had dog love yet.

Not unless you count
getting bitch slapped.

I promise you'll get over this.

You'll meet somebody else.

You'll love her,
she won't love you.

She'll love you,
you won't love her.

You'll love each other, but
she's married to a cop

who catches you in a motel room
and beats you near to death

with his big police flashlight.

The point is,

you've got a lot of living
to do, right, Berta?

You don't want to
piss off a cop.

Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

You've really given me
a lot to think about.

Hey, hey, hey, nobody
likes a smartass.

Not so sexy when it
happens to you, is it?

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

I give up, Herb.

How do you tell
a kabob to be quiet?

Shh... kabob.

Very clever.
Very clever.

Well, when you're
a pediatrician,

you need to have a lot
of kid-friendly jokes.

Sometimes when I use
the little reflex hammer,

I pretend I'm an Indian.

(chanting)

It's not politically correct,
but the tykes love it.

Oh, boy.

I wish my doctor had
a sense of humor.

Every time I have a prostate
exam, I say,

"What, you're not going to buy
me dinner first?"

And nothin',

not even a smile.

Really? 'Cause that's a beaut.

That's what I thought.

But most people
just don't get me.

Well, that's their loss.

(ringtone playing "I've Been
Working on the Railroad")

Excuse me.

Uh-oh.

Hi, Judith.

I, uh, just stopped
for a bite to eat.

I know you have
leftover meat loaf.

Probably left over from when
I was married to her.

Shh, shh, shh.

What?

That was Alan.

Yes, that Alan.

Hi, Judith.

No, no, Jake's not here.
It's just the two of us.

No, I have not
lost my mind.

Whoa, whoa.

Calm down.

Judith, calm down.

Can we talk about this
when I get home?

All right, bye.

She says hi back.

Sorry to get you in trouble.

Oh, no trouble. I'm a grown man.

And I think I can have lunch
with whoever I want.

Right.

So, how's the chiropractor biz?

Well, it's been a little slow,

you know, with the economy
and everything,

but I'm starting to see
a little turnaround,
and it's been...

I'm sorry. I gotta go.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(acoustic guitar playing
soft chords)

JAKE:
Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, Celeste,
you are the best Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª With you I was blessed,
but I failed the test Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª And now I'm depressed,
Celeste... Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª You might as well take
my heart Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Out of my chest Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª And mail it... Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª All the way to Budapest Ã¢ÂÂª

(knocking)

Got a minute?

I'm busy.

Yeah, I heard.

Budapest.

Very catchy.

What do you want?

I want to apologize for sending
you down a bad road

with your girlfriend.

Yeah, well, forget it.
I'm gonna get her back.

Well, good, good.

So what's the plan?

I'm gonna finish writing my song

and then I'm gonna sing it
to her.

Okay, uh,
is that the entire plan?

No.

I'm also gonna put on
a clean shirt.

Ooh, pulling out the big guns.

Yep.

Can I offer an alternative plan?

I don't want to hear
any more plans from you.

Understandable.

I'd be a little
skeptical in your shoes,

but just hear me out.

The song, good as it is,
it smacks of desperation.

Thank you.

Uh, no, no.

I mean, girls don't generally
respond to desperation.

How do you know?

Are you kidding?
I've been watching your father

get shot down for 25 years.

It's like living with
an Air Force training film.

Listen, if you really want to
get Celeste back, you man up,

go over to her house,

admit you made a mistake
with the other girl,

you realize now
that Celeste is
one in a million,

blah, blah, blah,
and if she doesn't

ever wanna see you again,
you understand.

And then sing her the song?

Forget the song.

Okay.

Do I really say
"blah, blah, blah"?

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

Alan, wait!

You forgot your kabob.

Oh. Oh, thank you.

You're welcome.

And thanks again
for driving.

It was fun.

Oh, yeah,
I had a good time, too.

I'm glad.

So... we should
do it again sometime.

I'd like that.

Great, great.
You know, I'm gonna go

to the flea market tomorrow.
You wanna join me?

Tomorrow?

Oh, gee, I don't know.

Oh, I'm sorry.
It's probably too soon.

No, no.

No, it's not, it's just...

Judith. I know, I know.

I'm just not sure
what to tell her.

Well, you can tell her
the truth.

What is the truth, Alan?

That we're friends.

We are friends, aren't we?

Okay, friend.

I'll see ya tomorrow.

It's a date.

(chuckles)

(chuckles)

(chuckles) Oh! Jake,
Jake, hi, buddy. Um...

I don't care.
I got my own problems.

Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, Celeste, I am congested Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª With love
for my Celeste... ed Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Yeah Ã¢ÂÂª

(knocking)

Did you talk to her?

Yeah.

How'd it go?

Not so good.

You sang that song, didn't you?

No, I did exactly what you said.

I told her I'm sorry,

I made a mistake
with that other girl

and she's one in a million,
blah, blah, blah.

Okay, just to be clear,

you didn't really say
"blah, blah, blah"?

I'm not an idiot, Uncle Charlie.

No, no, of course not.
Then what?

Then I said if she never wants
to see me again, I'd understand.

And what'd she say?

"I never want to see you again""

Ouch.

Ouch? That's it?

That's all you've got?

Well, you know,
look at the bright side.

You got a great song out of it.

Ten more girls peein' on you,
you got an album.

Or a fetish.

Okay, well...

say no to drugs.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(doorbell chimes)

Oh, hey, Judith.

Just came by
to pick up Herb.

We're going
to the flea market.

No, you're not.

What do you mean?
I just talked to him.

Look, Alan, I discussed it
with Herb and we decided

that it's not in anyone's best
interest for you two

to be spending time together.

You both decided that, huh?
Yes.

Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to hear it from Herb.

I do mind.

The two of you hanging out is
wrong. It's unnatural.

Excuse me, but I have done
a few unnatural things

in my day,
and this is not unnatural.

Good-bye, Alan.

Our marriage,
that was unnatural!

You can't do this, Judith!

You cannot keep us apart!

Herb and I will find a way
to be together!

Hi.

Hi.

That must've sounded
kinda strange.

Not at all.

Herb is a very handsome man.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

Hey, I brought you
another soda.

Thanks.

(sighs)

Believe me, Jake,
you'll get over Celeste.

I don't wanna get over her.
I think she was the one.

The one what?

The one, you know,
who was pretty and liked me

and maybe was gonna let me
do stuff to her someday.

And you think there's only one
of those out there?

What do you think?

It doesn't matter what I think.

Jake, you gotta start looking
at this differently.

Women are kinda like
the little boxes of cereal

in one of those
variety packs.

I like the variety packs.

I know you do.

But they should put in more
sugary cereals

and less cereals
that help you poop.

No argument.

But my point is, a variety pack
approach gives you a choice.

It's really not
that great a choice.

In a pack of eight,

there's always at least
three poopin' cereals.

Okay, we're getting away
from the point.

What's your favorite cereal?

It used to be Frankenberry,

but I'm kind of on
a Froot Loops kick now.
Terrific.

They don't get
soggy as fast.
Got it.

Plus the milk
tastes better afterward.

Okay, okay, okay.

So imagine Celeste is
Froot Loops.

You like her now,

but who's to say she isn't
tomorrow's Frankenberry?

You're wrong.

Celeste will always be
my Froot Loops.

You can't know that.

Look at me.

I've been with a lot
of women,

but I only just recently found
the love of my life.

Well, no disrespect,
but I don't wanna wait

until I'm as old and hard up

as you are
to find a good girlfriend.

What?
I said no disrespect.

You know, you make it really
difficult to love you sometimes.

Yeah, that's what
my mom says.

Told ya I'm not an idiot.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(hushed):
Herb!

Herb!

(thud)

Alan?

Over here!

Alan...

I didn't want you to think
that I stood you up.

Oh, I know you'd never do that.

Judith just doesn't understand.

I know, and I'm sorry.

But what are we gonna do?

I don't know.

Well, maybe I'll see you
when I bring Jake back.

That'd be nice.

Bye.

Bye.

Alan, wait!

I'm coming with you!

But how?

Be careful, you big galoot.

I'm okay. I'm okay!

(creaking)

I'm not okay!

(thud)

Oh, God! Herb, talk to me!

(groans)

What's going on out here?!

Alan, wait! Take me with you!

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(TV plays)
I miss Celeste.

I miss Chelsea.

I miss Herb.

Uh, I mean, I mean,
Sex and the City.

I miss Sex
and the City.

Yeah, Alan,
that's much less gay.

I guess that's just what
our lives have come down to;

three pathetic,
lonely guys

watching television
on a Sunday night.

Oh, crap, it's Sunday night!

Chelsea's flying into LAX!

You gonna pick her up?

No, I'm gonna call her a cab
and take a Viagra.

Well, buddy, I guess
it's you and me.

No disrespect, Dad, but that
just makes it worse.

I said no disrespect.

Why doesn't that ever work?

(phone rings)

Hello?

Yeah, this is Jake.

Oh, hi, Nicole.

Yeah, I broke up with Celeste.

Now?

Sure. See ya in a few.

I'm gonna go meet Nicole
at the pier.

Who's Nicole?

I'm not really sure.

(sighs)

Ã¢ÂÂª I remember you... Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª You're the one who made
my dreams come true. Ã¢ÂÂª

(doorbell rings)
(music stops)

Herb.

We haven't got much time.

Judith thinks
I'm in physical therapy.

Well, then let's make
the most of it.

Hey, you got anything special
going on next week?

Well, let's see...
next week.

I like to keep Mondays
free for hangovers.

Tuesday, I was planning
on getting a haircut,

mani/pedi and a facial.

You know, guy stuff.

Wednesday, I have a meeting
with my business manager

to discuss my
retirement plan.

And, as you know,
Thursday and Friday

are kind of my "me" days.

Why do you ask?

I was thinking,
since I have a couple days off,

we could fly to Illinois
and visit my parents.

Oh.

I mean, you've only met
my mother once,

and you've never
met my dad.

That's true.

And I'd really
like him

to get to know you
before the wedding.

Of course.

Although, sometimes
with parents,

I'm better served
up as a surprise.

Don't be silly--
he'll love you.

And I'm sure
I'll love him.

So, good,
we'll fly out.

Illinois, here we come.

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

Good night.

Good night.

Oh, darn it.
What?

I just remembered I have
an appointment next week.

Doctor's appointment?

Yes.

Yes, a doctor's appointment.

Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, just a routine procedure
I've been putting off.

What do you mean,
like a colonoscopy?

Yes, exactly.

A colonoscopy.

Oh, Charlie,
you can't put that off.

No, no. No.

I want to meet your dad.

I've been putting off getting
a colonoscopy for years.

Forget it, mister.

You're keeping
that appointment.

But what about
meeting your dad?

We'll do it another time.

Are you sure?

Your health
is the most important thing.

I know how you
procrastinate.

I do, don't I?

Boy, what would you do
without me to take care of you?

Well, I'm pretty sure

I wouldn't be getting
a colonoscopy next week.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Hey.

You're not going to believe
what I just did.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Men, men, men, men,

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

All right, let me see if
I've got this straight.

In order to not spend time
with your fiancÃ©e's parents,

you're willing
to let a doctor

snake a camera
up your keister.

I'd be willing to let them
shoot an IMAX feature.

But, fortunately,
it won't be necessary.

Oh, how do you figure?
I have a plan.

Oh, a plan.

The day of the "procedure,"

you're going to pretend
to drive me to the "hospital."

But we're not going
to the hospital.

Precisely.

What we'll actually do
is go to the movies.

Then, afterwards, we'll go out
for a couple of drinks,

so when I get home,
I'll be appropriately woozy.

And I'll tell Chelsea

that my colon
is clean as a whistle.

You know, a whistle
that you swallowed,

then blew out your bunghole.

Sure.

And then, she'll
put me to bed.

I'll get some
"Oh, poor Charlie" sex,

with her being ever mindful
of my tender area.

Wow.

This is a new low,
even for you.

Now, now, to be fair,

it's only a new low
in this relationship.

True. True.

Can I pick the movie?

Fine.

Do I get snacks?

Yes.

I'm paying for everything.

Why do we continue
to play this game?

Because I still
have my pride.

No, you don't.

Charlie, you okay?

Uh, yeah, yeah.

I was just reminding Alan

that he has to take me in
for my colonoscopy.

Oh, that's not necessary.
I'll take you.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, I don't want you
wasting your time off

in a doctor's waiting room.

Don't be ridiculous.
I'm driving you.

Now, come back to bed.

Good plan.

âª Men. âª

No, no, no, no, no.

You don't understand.

I need a colonoscopy,
and it has to be next Wednesday.

Yes, I'll hold.

Can you believe it?

Their hold music
is "Tunnel of Love."

It's better
than "Brown Eyed Girl."

Oh, God, I hope I can get
an appointment.

Maybe you should grease
a few palms.

If it was me,
I'd be greasing everything.

Yeah, hi.

Well, great, great.

Wednesday, 8:00 a.m.

Thank you, thank you.

You've made me very happy.

Yeah, I imagine you don't
hear that too often.

What?

Yeah, fine, fine.

I-I-I won't eat on Tuesday.

What do you mean,
flush out my system?

Oh, ick.

All right,
I'm a little less happy now.

Good-bye.

You won't believe
what they want me to do.

You mean taking laxatives
and drinking a half gallon

of industrial strength
Colon Blow?

Oh, right,
you've done this before.

It seemed funnier then.

I gotta tell ya,
it seems pretty funny now.

Why don't you just
tell Chelsea the truth?

What, that I'd rather get
violated by a long metal tube

than spend time with her folks?

Somehow, I don't see her
taking that

in the spirit
in which it was intended.

True, true.

Well, I've said it before,

and I think I need
to say it again.

Good plan.

âª Men. âª

Why isn't Uncle Charlie
eating?

He has to fast before he goes
to the doctor's tomorrow.

Is he okay?

Oh, yeah.

He's just getting
a routine test.

They're taking a look
at his intestines.

How do they do that?

Well, what they do is,
they take a tiny camera

and put it on the end
of a tube...

Why don't we eat first?

Good idea.

Well, I'm happy to report

I just saw a piece
of Hubba Bubba

I swallowed in fifth grade.

Oh, for God's sake, Charlie,
we're having dinner.

Don't rub it in.

Speaking of which,
I'm out of baby wipes.

I bought you two boxes
of baby wipes.

What can I tell you?

Babies don't crap like this.

At least not healthy babies.

There's a jar of aloe vera
under the sink.

What am I supposed
to do with that?

Oh, you put a little glob

on the end
of your finger...
Alan!

It's cooling
and soothing.

Oh, good, good.

'Cause let me tell you--

you could roast a marshmallow
on my anus.

You know what'd be good
for dessert?

S'mores.

âª Men. âª

How come I'm not loaded?

They're supposed
to get me loaded

before they
do it, right?

Yes. They'll hook you up
to an IV

right before the procedure.

All right, just so we're all
on the same page,

I want to be stone-cold out
before anything goes in.

I'll tell them.

All I get is a glass of wine
and a "pretty please."

All right, Mr. Harper,
we're ready.

Did you bring
the drugs with you?
Oh, no, sir.

The anesthesiologist
takes care of that.

Good luck.
Thanks.

By the way, since we couldn't
make it to Illinois,

I'm flying my parents in
to stay with us for a week.

What?

Enjoy your colonoscopy,
you lying dirtbag.

You knew?

I knew.

I'll give you $1,000
to push me to the parking lot.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

How are you feeling?

Like a new fish
at Leavenworth.

Oh, don't be
so dramatic.

Good news is,
you have a clean bill of health.

Yes, but I lost
my watertight seal.

Yes, but you have
peace of mind.

Yes, but now I can't wear white
at our wedding.

Yay, no polyps!

Way to go, Uncle Charlie.

Now you know
how it feels.

Thanks for calling ahead.

There's the
happy couple.

Welcome home.

Charlie, you remember
my mother, Martha.

And this is my
father, Tom.

Good to see you again.

You, too.

Nice to finally
meet you, Charlie.
Nice to meet you.

Uh, not much of a grip.

But you're probably a little
weak from your anal probe.

Didn't make me stronger.

Isn't this great, Charlie

Because you couldn't
go see them, Chelsea's folks

dropped everything
to come spend time with you.

Yeah. It's great.

Isn't it funny
how plans work out?

Hey, I found some steaks
in the freezer.

Thought we'd have
a little barbecue.

Oh, Dad, he has to eat
light for a while.

Oh, please.

He's been treated like
a girl enough today.

He's not wrong.

I'm never wrong
about what a man needs.

Good golly.

What's that fruity smell
coming from your head?

It's an apricot
conditioner.

It keeps my hair
from getting frizzy

with all the humidity.

Oh, we need to get some
meat in you, pronto.

Tom's always on guard against
the homosexual agenda.

No offense.

âª Men. âª

You're a great cook, Tom.

Well, I always say,

a man's gotta be
self-sufficient.

I agree.

All I need is booze,
satellite TV and a housekeeper

and I could survive in a cave.

You know, if it were
air-conditioned.

I gotta ask you
something, Charlie.

Okay, I admit it.

I slept with your daughter.

But don't worry,

I'm still going to marry her.

Damn straight you are.

Which brings me
to my question.

When a man gets to be your
age and he's never married,

it's usually for one of
two reasons. One...

He's really lucky.

You're right,
not funny, go on.

What I'm tryin' to say is,

when a man gets to be 40
and he isn't married,

he's either a
rascal or a poof.

Interesting.

So?
So what?

So which one are you?

Uh... actually,
there's a third choice.

What's that?

Well, sometimes it takes a while

for a man to meet his soul mate,

like I finally met
your daughter.

Soul mate?
Yep.

So, poof.

Oh, just kiddin'.

How are my two favorite
fellas doing?

We're just fine, princess.

I just cleaned the grill

and now I'm givin' your beau
here a grillin'.

Well, stick a fork in me,
'cause I think I'm done.

Sorry, honey, my dad's always
been a little overprotective.

Well, I have to be.

When it comes to men, you've
always had a rotten picker.

No offense. I'm sure
you're the exception.

I'm glad you're sure.

Dad, why don't you go
see how mom's doing.

Oh, good idea.

She's jet-lagged and
still pretty wound up

over having a Colored pilot.

What can I say?

Mommy and daddy are
horrible biggots.

But they're my parents,
and I gotta love 'em, right?

You're askin' the wrong guy.

Look at them though.

42 years together

and they're still
best friends.

Well, let's face it.

Who else would
have them?

At least they don't lie
to each other.

Okay, I get it.

I lied about the colonoscopy.

Trust me, I've been
punished enough.

I'm just saying, if our
marriage is going to last,

we have to make
a commitment

to always be honest
with each other.

You have my word.

You've given me
your word before.

Well, then you'd be silly
to take it again, wouldn't you?

What? I'm being honest.

So, how are you liking
Los Angeles?

Well, the weather's
lovely.

Oh, it is, isn't it?

What we don't care for
are the freeways and Mexicans.

Yeah, yeah,
they-they do get congested.

I think it's all the cheese
they cook with.

How's everybody getting along
out here?

Oh, everything's
fine, dear.

Remember what
we talked about?

No politics, religion
or what have you.

You don't have to tell me twice.

I'm not a Polack.

Hey, Charlie,
when we drove in,

I noticed a tavern down the road.

How about you and I
go out for a drink?

Get to know each other
a little better.

Uh... sure, I guess.

Although, if you're on the
fence about me now,

alcohol isn't going to really
improve my chances.

I think it's a terrific idea.

You boys have fun.
All right.

I'm buying.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

He said he's buying.

Who would have thought
that the best part of my day

would be having a colonoscopy?

âª Men. âª

To my future son-in-law.

Down the hatch.

Considering my day,

it'd be more like
"up the hatch""

Cheers.

So, Alan, Chelsea tells me
you're a chiropractor.

I imagine you give
a great back rub.

Uh, well, I do, but there's
a lot more involved than that.

I like back rubs.

But I need strong
hands on me.

Martha's got these
little parrot claws,

can't get deep
in the muscle.

Let me see what you got.

Hmm. No calluses.

I prefer the feel
of calluses.

If you want to see calluses,

check the inside
of his right palm.

Look at that.

You don't see that
where I come from.

Oh, come on,

there's no gay people
where you live?

Of course there are,
but they got their own bar.

Little place called
"The Log Cabin."

On Forrester Street.

Right next to the A&W.

âª Yes, I'm on my way... âª

Amazing that people
in California

can behave that way in public.

Well, we kinda believe
in live and let live.

Oh, that's baloney.

I believe in the sanctity
of the family,

marriage between a man
and a woman.

âª Yes, I'm on my way... âª

But, damn,
those fellas do look happy.

Probably 'cause in California
they can't get married.

Really, really happy.

âª Men. âª

Down the hatch.

Looks like my future
father-in-law

has made
some new friends.

Yeah. I'm a
little confused.

I don't think
you're the only one.

âª Do you really want
to make me cry. âª

Oh, I love that song.

I hit it out of the park

on karaoke night at the VFW.

Chelsea didn't tell
me you're a vet.

Yeah, Navy.

Submarine Corps.

Oh, six month tours under
the polar ice cap.

Nothing to do but lift
weights, shoot the bull

and enjoy the company
of other men.

Six months with just men?

Not just men.

Young men.

Hard men.

And the hardest of them all
was Edward Boyton,

Seaman Third Class,

and my best pal.

1966, we were in the Philippines
for a week of R & R,

and we bought matching shirts.

Of course you did.

Oh, I remember
one night,

it was real hot and humid.

I can still see the wet silk

clinging to his
magnificent body.

Did you see this coming?

Uh-uh.

Then after we did our
hitch, we both went
our separate ways,

got married,
raised kids.

We still exchange
Christmas cards

and family photos
every year.

Terrific. Great,
great. Okay.

Why don't we drink
up and go home.

He's still in
great shape.

65 years old and
solid as a rock.

He lives in
Valencia.

Hey, how far is that from here?

Not so far.

It's right next
to Magic Mountain.

It's far, Alan...

Real far.

Right, right, it-it's far.

Come on, let's get you home
to your lovely wife.

Oh, she means well,
but she doesn't understand me.

Well, you're obviously
a complicated man.

Now, come on,

we've got a big day
tomorrow.

Universal Studios, then
Grauman's Chinese Theatre...

I want to go to Valencia.

Okay, we'll pencil it in.

See if we have time.

I want to go now!

I want to see Ed!

Yeah, but Ed is probably asleep.

You know, with his wife.
You want to know
a secret?

No, no, that's okay.
Don't ask, don't tell.

That's our philosophy.

I brought my silk shirt

and a VHS copy of
Ice Station Zebra

just in case, but shh.

You know who was great
in that movie?

Rock Hudson.
Shut up.

âª Men. âª

You guys have fun?

Oh, yeah.

My dad's really something,
isn't he?

Uh-huh.

Kind of a man's man.

You could say that.

I'm telling you, Martha,
I can't live this lie anymore!

You're drunk!

Now come to bed.
No!

It's a bed of lies!

I love Edward Boyton
and he loves me.

What the hell is happening?

I don't know,
but I have a feeling

your dad's going
to Magic Mountain tomorrow.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hey.

You get your mom
on the plane okay?

Yeah.

How's she doing?

Pretty shook up.

It's not every day
your husband tells you

he's leaving you
for a 65-year-old man.

What bothers her more,

that her marriage is over
or that her ex-husband

is now promoting
the homosexual agenda.

I'm not in the mood, Charlie.

You took my dad to the hotel?

Yeah. Yeah.

I met this Edward Boyton
he's been talking about.

Nice guy.

Oh, yeah?

Black guy.

Really?

Can I be the one
to tell your mom?

I'm going to go lay down.

Hey, Chels?

What?

Given everything that's
gone down with your dad,

I'm off the hook on the whole
lying to you

about the colonoscopy thing,
right?

Right.

Isn't it nice
when things work out?

.......... ********** ..........

Men.

Mmm, oh, and here's
another money saver:

If you buy a big bag
of irregular socks,

you can pair up the good ones

and use the cash you save
for underwear.

Good to know.

And you can use the leftover
misfit socks

for dusting gloves, golf club
cozies, even a hand puppet.

A hand puppet?

Oh, sure, couple of buttons for
eyes, and you're ready to go.

Hello, pretty lady.

That's funny.

So, you done the Internet dating
thing before?

All the time.
Oh, and if you're interested,

I know a couple of tricks
to weed out the losers.

I'm very interested.

Hey, how are ya?

Hi.

Oh, you know him?

No.

Oh, talking to
strange women.

Must be drunk.

Anyway, my profile says
that I am a chiropractor,

but I also do a lot of
holistic work, you know

acupressure, deep
tissue massage,

both of which promote a
general sense of well being

and also a heightened
sexual sensitivity.

(chuckles)

Assuming, of course,

your sexual sensitivity
requires heightening.

I have absolutely no intention
of sleeping with you, Alan.

Whoa, whoa, where'd that
come from? (chuckles)

I'm just talking about my job.

Making conversation.

And when you say
"absolutely no intention,"

you just mean tonight, right?

Um, you look like you could use
another one of these.

You're a mind reader.

Uh, excuse me,

but, uh, I'm
with this lady,

and if she would like
another drink,

I am more than capable
of providing one.

But the dinner's still dutch.

What's your name?

Uh, Louanne.

Hi, Louanne, I'm Marcus.

All right, all right,

fun time's over.

Look, Marcus,
the lady is on

a date with me, and
you are intruding.

Why don't we ask the lady
what she wants?

Not necessary. I can tell you
what she wants and it's not me.

But there is a
principle involved

and that is one

of poaching
another man's gal.

Is that so?

Yes, that's so. Now take a hike.

Why don't you just sit down
and finish your peanuts?

Don't you touch me!

Hey, hey, calm down.

You're right, you're right.

We should just, uh,
take a deep breath

and calm down.

That's a good idea.

So, what are you doing after
Potsie here drops you off?

Hey, Marcus?

How's that, bitch?!

* Men. *

What are you doing in there?

Be patient.

I got you a surprise.

You hear that?

She got us a surprise.

(phone rings)

You gonna grab that?

You'll have to be more specific.

Answer the phone,
Charlie.

Right, right.

Hello?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down.

Who is this?

Oh, hi, Alan.

Not a good time right now.

Really?

What the hell
are you doing in jail?

You're kidding me.

That's hilarious!

(laughs)

All right, all right,
I'm on my way.

What do you think?

Doing-oing-oing-oing!

I was gonna save it
for our wedding night,

but I couldn't wait.

Oh, baby, by the time
we get married,

that thing's gonna be
half-eaten.

Who was on the phone?

Alan.

Everything all right?

Yeah, he was just callin' to say
he wouldn't be home tonight.

Oh, did he get lucky?

Not yet, but the night
is still young.

* Men, men, men, men, manly men,

Ten hours!

Ten hours I sat in that
urine-soaked jail cell!

You shouldn't have
peed yourself.

You said you'd be right there!

Look, look,
I understand your anger,

but you gotta see it
from my side.

What's your side?

I get really sleepy after sex!

What's going on?

Oh, your gallant fiancÃ©

let his baby brother rot
in a prison cell all night.

What?

Oh, come on, it was
the Beverly Hills jail.

I've been there
plenty of times.

You slip
the booking officer a $20,

he'll send out for Starbucks.

You know I don't carry
that kind of cash.

Regardless, it was
just one night.

Nobody took your man cherry,
did they?

Was that why
Alan called last night?

Uh... I assume so.

Oh, Charlie.

Hey, hey, you had that sexy
lingerie on

and you were so beautiful,

plus you know how

I hate to waste an erection.

I can't believe you abandoned
your brother when he needed you.

It's horrible.

How did I become the bad guy
in all this?

He's the felon!

Why were you in jail, Alan?

I was forced to use my hands
to defend a lady's honor.

Ask him what happened
to the lady.

She drove the guy I punched

to the emergency room.

I don't understand.
Why would she go with him

if you were defending her honor?

Who knows?
I would've asked her,

but I was busy being handcuffed
and dragged off to jail!

Where I spent the night covering
my behind with a food tray.

Shame on you,
Charlie Harper.

Now she's mad at me.

Happy?

Oh, yeah, m m riried!

If my transsexual biker
cell mate had only been

a little more affectionate,
my life would now be perfect!

* Men. *

I don't know.
I just snapped and hit him.

It's the first time in my life
that's ever happened.

You mean it's the first time
you've ever won.

The important thing now
is for you to know

that your family is a hundred
percent behind you.

Thanks, Mom.

Now, before we waste money
on some expensive lawyer,

how much jail time
are we talking about

if you just roll over?

I don't want to go to jail!

And if he does, he certainly
doesn't want to roll over.

Charles, that is crude
and uncalled for.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Nobody wants to go to jail,

sweetie, but let's face it,

if all we're talking about
is 60 days alone in a room

with no friends, how is that
different from two months

squatting in
your brother's house?

You're kidding, right?

I guess.

You know what?
Don't worry yourself.

I'll just get a public defender
and take care of this myself.

There you go, problem solved.

Charlie?

What? Some kid out
of law school

hungry to make his bones.
What's wrong with that?

He gets his hair cut by trainees
at the barber college.

Alan, I'd be happy
to help you hire a lawyer.

Oh, no, Chelsea,
I couldn't take money from you.

That's an honor
he reserves for family.

So, what, you guys really aren't
gonna help him?

Well, of course we are.

But if we didn't torture him
a little bit,

he wouldn't feel comfortable
accepting our help.

You don't know that. Try me!

I'll tell you what.
I'll find the lawyer,

and we'll sptit thfefe

Not fifty-fifty, 'cause I'm out
six years of room,

board and incidentals.

And by incidentals, I mean
mostly Kleenex and hand lotion.

Oh, please, I paid

for four years of college
and chiropractor school,

and he still gives me handmade
tchotchkes for Christmas.

You said you loved
the pot holders I made you.

I said they made me cry.

Okay, okay, okay, fifty-fifty.

But we'll put it on my card
so I get the miles.

I can't believe you two.

That's oyay,helsea, I'm used
to being treated this way.

The mocking, the insults,
the humiliation.

It's all part of the festering
ugliness of this family.

See? He's fine with this.

* Men. *

Thanks for coming, you guys.

Your support
means a lot.

Thank her.

If it was up to me,

you'd be in San Quentin wearing
lipstick and a mop wig.

Okay, Mom,
I gotta go.

No, I love you.

Okay. What?

No, you're not bothering me.

I'm happy
to take care of it. Okay.

Okay, bye-bye.

Sorry. I just bought my mom
a new computer,

and it's opened up
quite a can of worms.

Ironic. I just bought my mom
a can of worms.

Brad Harlow.

Are you Alan?

No, no, no,
I'm his brother Charlie.

This is my fiancÃ©e Chelsea.

And this pasty-faced jughead
is the family Rottweiler.

I just want it
on record

that I am not by nature
a violent man.

My fuse is long,

but it is attached
to dynamite.

Shut up.

I'm payin' by the hour.

Would you two
just stop it.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.
I have siblings, too.

We tease each other constantly.
You know, sometimes I think

it's just easier
than saying "I love you."

Okay, well, I got some good news
for you, Alan.

Hey, when's the last time
you heard that?

I made some calls,

and the fella you punched has

quite few
alcohol-related priors,

and is definitely not looking
to press charges.

So I don't have
to go back to jail?

You won't even see the inside
of a courtroom.

Oh, thank God!

I can't go back to
the joint again.

All right, great,
we're off the clock.

What do I owe you?

Eh, relax,
you don't owe me anything.

Even better.
Thank you.

Charlie. We... we have
to pay you for your time.

Oh, you hippie.

Well, uh,

well, you can always make
a donation to my charity.

What's that, Lawyers
Without Yachts?

(laughs)

No...

no, it's for inner city kids.

They come out to my ranch
once a month,

you know, learn to ride horses,
get out in the fresh air.

Oh, that's wonderful.

I love horses.

I used to ride
all the time.

Shall I write you a check?

No, no, no, no, I got it.

Who do I make it out to?

Danielle's Darlings.

Who's Danielle?

My late wife.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, thank you. Thank you.

I started the charity
to keep her memory alive.

She loved horses.

Crap. That's another zero.

There you go.

Wow.
This is incredibly generous.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

You know, we're having
a nature ride and barbecue

for the kids this Saturday.

You should come.

Really? That sounds wonderful.

Doesn't it, Charlie?

Do the kids race
the horses?

What?

No.

There's no action?

No action.

I don't see the point.

He's just joking.

No, I'm not.

I really don't
see the point.

Well, if you change your mind,
here's the info.

We'd love
to see you.

Thank you. Maybe we will.

Great.
Yeah, maybe.

Thanks very much, Brad.

Always nice to bring
good news to a client.

And the best news is,

I think having a criminal record
is really spice up

my online dating profile.

I might even post
the mug shot.

* Men. *

Wasn't Brad terrific?

Who's Brad?

Alan's lawyer.

Uh, he's okay, I guess.

You guess?

Not only does he have
a successful law practice,

he's doing so much
to help poor kids.

What, by sticking
them on horses?

How's that
going to help?

Get them a high paying job
with the pony express?

It's not about jobs.

It's about getting
them out of the city

and into the fresh air.

Fresh air?

Have you ever
smelled a horse?

You know what I mean.

And did you hear the way
he talked about family?

They obviously mean
a lot to him.

Family also meant a
lot to Charles Manson.

That's a terrible
thing to say.

Sorry.

Hey, speaking of
horseback riding-

why don't you hop on and
I'll race you to the finish.

You know what, I'm not
really in the mood.

That's okay. I've got enough
mood for both of us.

Good night, Charlie.

But Charlie's a
frustrated pony.

Go to sleep.

I was pretty
charitable today.

Mm-hmm.

I guess the spirit of giving

doesn't extend
to the bedroom, huh?

Good night, Charlie.

(nickering)

* Men. *

Hey.
Hey.

Can't sleep?

Nope.

Me neither.

Even though I dodged
the legal bullet,

I've got all this stuff
building up inside me.

I'm afraid I'm going to explode.

I'm afraid I won't.

The other night in that bar,
I just snapped.

It was like I became
a different person.

Well, th had to be
a nice break for you.

I'm scared, Charlie.

I mean, there was a part
of me that really enjoyed

driving my fist into
that jerk's stupid face

and watching him crumble
to the floor in agony.

So what are you scared of?

What if this is
just the beginning?

What if I've awakened
some long-dormant monster

inside of me
who revels in violence?

What if I can't
control the monster?

What if the monster
takes over?

Ouchy!

You're fine. Go
to bed, monster.

Okay, good night.

* Men. *

What happened
to your hand?

Oh, well...

I won't lie to you.

I got into a bar fight

and punched a guy
in the face.

Yeah, right.

No, I'm serious.
I spent the night in jail.

Fine, don't tell me.

I was just trying
to make conversation.

Hey, I am warning you.

There is a monster
inside of me

and you don't want
to wake him up.

Oh! Oh! Hot, hot.

Did the monster burn his
mouth with his chamomile tea?

It's oolong.

Where's Chelsea?

She went to that
charity thing

for inner city horses.

You let her go
without you?

Why the hell would I want to go?

I hate kids
and I'm scared of horses.

Maybe you didn't notice
the way my lawyer

was looking at your fiancÃ©e.

What are you
talking about?

Or the way she was
looking back at him.

That's ridiculous.

I'm telling you, there
were definitely sparks

between the two of them.

You think?

Charlie, that guy
is everything you're not.

Well, what's that mean?

He likes people,
he loves his mother,

he works with children

and he doesn't stumble
through life

stinking of whiskey
and KY Jelly.

Hey, hey, hey,
KY Jelly is odorless.

Not where you put it.

I'm just saying that
if Chelsea were my fiancÃ©e,

I wouldn't leave her
alone with this guy.

If Chelsea were
your fiancÃ©e,

you'd have bigger problems.

Like what?

Like being the
last man on Earth.

* Men. *

I don't understand why
I have to go to this thing.

Because your uncle
wants to use you

to camouflage
his growing fear

that his girlfriend might
be interested in another guy.

Hey, hey, hey.
I have no fear.

Of course not.

You just got
a sudden craving

for barbecue
and horses.

Whoa, there's gonna be
barbecued horses?

Cool.

Where the hell is this
lawyer's stupid ranch?

You must have passed
the turnoff.

Maybe we should put
the GPS back on.

I don't need
the GPS.

GPS: Take the
next legal U-turn.

Then proceed 22 miles
to main road.

Okay, turn around.

There's no room.

Well, then back up.

22 miles?

Just till you find
a place to turn.

I'm hungry.

We're almost there.

I don't think so.
I'd smell the barbecue.

Jake, would you pipe down

so I can concen...?

Oh, damn.

You have reached
your destination.

(sniffs)

I don't think so.

* Men. *

Un-freakin'- believable.

Still no signal.

Well, of course,
there's no signal.

We're in the middle
of nowhere.

I'm starving.

What do you want from me?
Go catch a squirrel.

This is why
I always tell you

to keep an emergency kit
in your car.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No matter what happens,
I know that in my trunk

is a thermal blanket,
flashlight, batteries,

bottled water and
assorted protein bars.

You hear that, Jake?

You have an inheritance.

I already ate
the proteibars..

You were right, Alan.

The more time Chelsea
spends with this Brad guy,

the more time she's going to
have to contrast and compare.

And I'm not going to come
out of that looking so good.

If you're really worried
about her being attracted

to a better man than you,

why don't you become
a better man?

(mocking tone): Why don't
you become a better man?

Yeah, like that.

* Men. *

You guys think there are
mountain lions up here?

Hadn't given it
much thought.

Till just now.

Relax. There's no
mountain lions here.

You know, this is where
it normally goes bad

in slasher movies.

One guy falls back a little bit,

usually to smoke pot
or have sex,

and he gets his head
hacked off.

Let that be a lesson to you
about drugs and premitalalex.

Good parenting, Alan.
Thank you.

(growling)

ALAN: Mountain lion!
Mountain lion! Run! Run!

Oh, crap! Hey, guys wait up!

(screaming)

Psych.

I can't believe you really
thought I was a mountain lion.

Go to your room.

You're punishing me just because
you're gullible?

Yeah, pretty much.

(Jake growling)

Still not funny!

Chelsea's not home.

How could she not
be home yet?

That thing was
over hours ago.

Are you worried she might be
cheating on you with Brad?

No, I was thinking car trouble,
but thanks for that.

Sorry.

Look, Chelsea and I have been
together for over a year now.

We're engaged to be married.

What are the odds she's going
to leave me for some lawyer

just because he's kind,
rich, handsome, generous,

loves his family and named
a charity after his dead wife?

I don't know, even money?

At least.

So ten bucks just
to make it interesting?

(slap)
ALAN: Ouchy!

.......... ********** ..........

Maybe you didn't notice the way

my lawyer was looking at your fiancÃÂ©e.

What are you talking about?

Or the way she was looking back at him.

Charlie, that guy is everything you're not.

* Men. *

Where the hell is she, Alan?

Calm down; don't work yourself into a tizzy.

A tizzy?

I don't have tizzies.

Women have tizzies. You have tizzies.

Me, I am outraged,
I am furious, I am, I am...

Miffed?

Do not complete my sentences

if you don't grasp the concept.

Sorry.

She should've been home hours ago.

I'm sure there's a
perfectly good explanation.

Oh, really? And what would that be?

Okay, well, after the barbecue ended,

Chelsea stayed behind to help clean up.

And then she and Brad got to talking

about all the things they have in common.

You know, their love of horses, children...

Probably just lost track of time.

Because, you know, he's so easy to talk to.

Not to mention how...

good-looking he is.

Or she got diarrhea.

Oh, maybe she called.

Oh, look, there's two messages.

This is Jenny from Malibu Day Spa.

I just wanted to confirm
your Saturday appointment

for a bikini wax.

Bikini wax?!

Uh, I wear a European-cut bathing suit.

I like to keep it tidy down there.

Anyway, I'm sure the next one is Chelsea.

Hi, Mr. Harper. This is Jenny again.

Just a reminder- we can no longer accept

a personal check from you...

I should've just gone with her
to that stupid charity thing.

True. If you'd made a little effort,

you wouldn't be in this situation.

But I bet she knew I wouldn't go

when she asked me.

In fact, I bet she was
counting on me not going,

so she could be alone with this Brad guy.

Do you really think Chelsea
would do something like that?

Why not? That's what I'd do.

I mean, hypothetically.

If I were ever in that situation.

Again.

Right.

The point is, I've been honest
through this whole thing.

She's the one who's been deceitful.

She's nothing but a manipulative,

calculating, two-faced... Hey, honey.

(sweetly): Oh, hi, baby.

How was the party?

It was great.

There was, like, 80 kids
taking turns riding a horse

for the first time in their lives.

So, what, there was just one horse?

No.

Good, 'cause that would've
been a tough day for the horse.

Sorry I'm late, but after we got
the kids back on the busses,

a bunch of us hung out to
chat and help clean up.

Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.

I just want to jump in
the shower and go to bed.

Okay, I'll be right up.

Night, Alan. Night.

Glad you had a good time.

Well done.

You sublimated your anger and
came from a place of love.

You took the high road.

Really? Is that what you call it?

'Cause I call it a
complete and total betrayal

of my testicles.

If you'd done it as much as I had,

you'd call it the high road.

* Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men *

* Ah. * * Men. * * Men. *

Transcript by Addic7ed.com

Hey, Chels?

So, when you say a bunch
of you stayed to clean up,

how many are you talking about?

I don't know; a couple.

Uh-huh.

You know, technically, a couple is two.

So are you saying there were two people

in addition to you and
Brad or just you and Brad?

What are you getting at?

Nothing. Just trying to get
an accurate head count.

You could've come with me, you know.

I know.

to do some things together once in a while.

We do plenty of things together.

Besides sex.

Oh...

When Brad's wife was alive,
they played tennis every day.

Probably what killed her.

She was hit by a car.

Maybe she was chasing a tennis ball.

You know, like a dog.

You throw it, they run after it,

even if there's traffic...

Goofy dogs.

* Men. *

(crowd cheering)

What the hell is that?

Two guys in a cage beating
the snot out of each other.

I can't believe I wasted so
many years watching cartoons.

Turn it down.

Aye, aye, Captain Douche.

What did you say?

Aye, aye, Captain. I'll do that.

Why are you on the couch?
You and Chelsea have a fight?

No, we didn't have a fight.

Were you farting in your sleep?

No.

Did you screw up the sex?

What the hell are you talking about?

You know, there's more than
one way to satisfy a woman.

Oh, really? Like what?

I'm not sure.
But I have some theories

Get out!

Fine.

We wouldn't have these problems
if you just put a TV in my room.

We wouldn't have these problems

if I just put a python in your room.

TouchÃÂ©, douchÃÂ©.

What?

I said touchÃÂ©, douchÃÂ©.

BERTA: * I really can't stay *

(in deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside *

(normal voice): * I've got to go away *

(deep voice): * Baby, it's cold outside... *

You mind? I'm trying to sleep.

Hey, I didn't see you there.

What'd you do?

I don't want to talk about it.

Fine. I'm not one to pry.

Money?

No.

Old girlfriend?

No.

She find those Polaroids?

No.

How did you know about the Polaroids?

You just told me, you dirtbag.

So, what did you do,

try to sneak in at 2:00 a.m.

smellin' of booze and pole dancer?

For your information,
Chelsea's the one who came home late.

And she was smelling of horse.

Oh, good Lord, Charlie,
you can't compete with a horse.

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Seriously.

and you're blessed,
but you ain't no Seabiscuit.

When have you seen my... tallywacker?

I don't know, maybe the nine or
ten times I found you passed out

in your bathtub, holding onto it
like it was a flotation device.

Sorry about that.

Don't be.

Mmm, boy!

Breakfast,

the most important meal of the day.

Three scrambled egg whites,

two slices of "I can't believe
it's not buttered" rye toast

and to flush it through me,

a piping hot cup of freshly ground coffee.

(coffee grinder whirring)

Shut that thing off!

(whirring resumes)

Don't push me. I'm not in the mood.

Did you sleep on the couch last night?

What's it to ya?

Oh, Charlie, what'd you do?

Nothing. Nothing?

I may have compared Brad's
recently deceased wife

to a ball-chasing dog.

Whose balls?

Tennis balls.

Get your mind out of the gutter.

All right, look- while this is
admittedly a bump in the road,

you do have an opportunity here

to really improve your
relationship with Chelsea.

How do you figure?

Well, think about it-

the reason you're threatened by Brad

is because he's a much better man than you.

No, he's not.

I would never come on to
another guy's fiancÃÂ©e.

Okay, first of all, we don't know

that he's come on to Chelsea.

And secondly, I've seen you hit on a bride

while she was walking down the aisle.

That was a joke.

I asked her what she was doing later.
Everybody laughed.

My point is, if Chelsea is
looking around for a better guy,

why not make that guy you?

Because I'm not a better guy than me.

Not yet.

But you do have something going
for you that Brad doesn't.

What's that?

Room to improve.

Lots and lots of room to improve.

***

And keep in mind, you're the underdog here,

and everybody loves an underdog.

Then how come nobody loves you?

The principle is still sound.

Just go up there and tell Chelsea you know

that you're a flawed human being,

but that you will spend the rest
of your life trying to be better

because she deserves the best.

So, lie.

You don't have to lie.

Don't you think you're a flawed human being?

Of course I do. But I know me.

I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life doing anything,

let alone try to be a better human being.

Oh, come on, Charlie.

Look at every New Year's
resolution I've ever made.

I've got the best of intentions,
but by January third or fourth,

there I am broke, hung over,
and coughing up stripper glitter.

Okay, lie.

* Men. *

Hey Chels... I brought
you some orange juice.

Thank you.

Is there any coffee?

No, no, my stupid brother broke the grinder.

There's vodka in this orange juice.

Whoopsie, that's mine.

It's 8:00 in the morning.

Hence the orange juice.

about my unfortunate remarks last night.

And tell you I love you and
I'll spend the rest of my life

trying to be a better man
because you deserve the best.

Well, I appreciate you saying that.

So... we're good?

Yeah.

Great.

So what do you want to do today?

Your choice - whatever
makes you happy. Really?

I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything.

Of course, you'll have to drive.

Well, I was thinking of
going to Beverly Hills

for this charity blood drive.

Great.

We'll give blood together.

Nothing I like better on a Sunday

than tapping a vein for a good cause.

Terrific. Brad will be happy to see us.

Brad?

It's his charity.

He's got another charity?

What the hell's this guy's problem?

It's not a problem, Charlie.

He's a very caring and compassionate man.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a freakin' saint.

And you were already
planning on seeing him again.

Well, yeah. He told me

about the blood drive last night.

Right, right, while you were "cleaning up."

What's "this"?

Oh, I think you know what "this" is.

Just go to hell!

Hey, hey-hey,

I'm not the one sneakin'
around seeing somebody

behind my fiancÃÂ©'s back!

I am not sneaking around!

Figuring that I wouldn't.

Very sneaky!

Drop dead!

(grinder whirrs, revving up)

Fixed it.

* Men. *

So...

*****

Okay, first of all,
I have nothing to be sorry about.

And second, I am not gonna
discuss my personal life

with someone whose current
girlfriend is a gym sock.

Wow, no wonder she left.

You just lash out for no reason.

EVELYN: Hello?

Out here!

That's my reason.

Boo-hoo. When you gonna stop

blaming your problems on your mommy?

Hey, boys.

Charlie, where's your bride-to-be?

We were gonna finalize the guest list.

She's not here.

She told him to go to hell.

Will you please shut up?

Oh, Charles, what did you do?

I didn't do anything!

He slept on the couch last night.

Nobody's talking to you!

And this is what we've been living with.

Stop heating your socks in the
microwave, you little freak!

Charlie, please don't
let this girl get away.

Don't worry, I won't.

Good, 'cause she's one in a million

and you're a dime a dozen.

Yeah, but I'm the underdog,
and everybody loves the underdog.

Oh, God, now you sound like your brother.

How do you plan on getting her back?

I'm gonna become a better man.

Great, so no plan at all.

* Men. *

What's the forecast?

(slurring): High tonight, low tomorrow.

A hundred-percent chance of hangover.

Heard from Chelsea?

She's staying with her
father for a few days.

At least that's what she e-mailed me.

You don't think she could be with...

Go ahead, say it.

Braa-ad!

You know what?

If she is, fine.

Good riddance.

I was never meant to be tied
down to one woman, anyway.

Well, you are by nature a free spirit.

(sobbing): I miss her, Alan!

I can't live without her!

And you don't have to.

Remember our talk?

Becoming a better man?

Screw it!

I'm as good as I'm ever gonna be!

If she doesn't like it, the hell with her!

That is true. In a healthy relationship,

your partner needs to
accept you for who you are.

(sobbing): Oh, she deserves
better than me, Alan!

She's such a wonderful gal!

I know, I know.

She's-she's like an angel!

She... She sure is.

Then why is she running off with Braa-ad?

This is not angel behavior, Alan.

You know what kind of behavior this is?

Charlie behavior.

(wailing): I took an angel
and I turned her into me!

* Men. *

Charlie...?

I can't sleep in my bed.

It smells like Chelsea.

O- Okay. Well...

why don't you stay here

and I'll go sleep in your room.

No, no, no, don't go.

I don't wanna be alone.

All right.

You're wearing pajama bottoms, right?

Shh...

Exactly how drunk are you?

Both questions...

asked and answered.

* Men. *

(curtly): What?

Oh, hi, Chelsea.

No... no, he's up.

Or not.

Hang on. I'll find him.

Charlie?

Found him. Hold on.

Hey, Charlie?

What?

You got a phone call.

I'll call back.

It's your fiancÃÂ©e.

(brightly): Oh, hey, baby.

No, no, I've been up for a while.

So how are ya?

Uh-huh.

What's going on?

Man, you'll do anything not to
kick in a little rent, won't ya?

Are you coming home? I really miss you.

Uh, sure, I can meet you
for coffee, no problem.

Half hour? No problem. See ya.

(groans)

Problem?

What the hell are you doing here?

* Men. *

Hi, sweetie.

Sorry I'm late.

I got you some coffee.

Thank you.

(gulping)

Isn't that awfully hot?

Scalding!

(raspy cough)

So, what's new?

We need to talk about Brad.
No, no, we don't.

I'm sorry.

I trust you, and I was
totally and completely wrong

to think there might be something going on

between you two.

Thank you for that. You're welcome.

Okay, let's go home.

Hold on. I do have a
confession to make.

Oh, this is never good.

The reason I got so upset

by the things you said was because,

well, you kind of touched a nerve.

Yeah, I do that. I'm a nerve toucher.

Runs in the family.

Okay, well, confession's over.

And you forgive me, I forgive you.

Let's go home.

I'm not done.

Aw, crap.

The thing is, I was kind of
attracted to Brad.

He loves his family and he really cares

about his friends and his community.

I'm taking from your tone
that stuff's important to you.

Yes, Charlie, it's important to me.

Okay.

Did you and Brad do
anything other than talk?

Of course not. Nothing's happened.

Oh, thank God.

But while I do love you,

I need to know you care as much as I do.

I do.

You say that,

but are you willing to really
work on our relationship?

Of course I am.

We can start doing things together;
community things.

You know, with the-the-the...
the kids that are poor

and the old people that
fall and can't get up.

What about your family?

I'll get a new family.

Look, I'm telling you, I can change.

(gagging): I can be a better man;
the man you want me to be.

(gagging intensifies): And I promise you...

Excuse me.

(vomits)

Oh, my God!

I am so, so sorry.

You threw up on my baby!

(baby crying)

Anyway, to be fair,
I don't think the carrots were mine.

Get away from him, you pig!

Cute kid.

(baby crying)

Chels?

(sighs)

Damn.

I just got a call from Chelsea.

Oh, yeah?

She said she wants to postpone the wedding.

I know.

I'm sorry.

Thanks.

Believe it or not, I do love you,

and I hate to see you hurt.

Yeah, well... I guess I kinda had it coming.

But you tried.

I did.

I just have one question.

What's that?

Did you really vomit on a baby?

Don't beat yourself up too much.

We've all done that.

You're kidding.

most of us do it on our own babies.

.......... ********** ..........

CHELSEA: First box goes in my car, the other in the truck.

Guess that's it.

You got everything?

I think so.

I, uh, left the house keys

and the garage clicker by the nightstand.

Thanks.

so you still plan to...move in with your dad?

Just for a while.

- You gonna be okay? - Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

I mean, I am gonna miss the cat.

You hate Sir Lancelot.

I did at first, but over time I came to find...

Yeah, you're right. I hate that thing.

I put in a change of address at the post office,

but here's my dad's address just in case.

I might be open to a trade.

I'll keep the cat, you take Alan.

Still got his carrier.

Take care of yourself, Charlie.

You do the same.

I'm sorry it didn't work out.

Me, too.

Well, she's gone.

You handled that very maturely.

What are you gonna do?

We tried.

Didn't work. Life goes on. Mmm.

You want a drink?

Nah. Drinking isn't gonna solve anything.

What-what are you doing?

Nothing.

Really?

Doesn't look like nothing.

Where you going?

Out for a swim.

You never go in the water.

That's 'cause I'm not a good swimmer.

You don't think he's gonna...

I don't know.

Charlie, stop this!

Charlie, come back!

It's not that bad!

Come on, Charlie, you still got your family!

Very smart; now he's sprinting.

Damn it, Charlie, get out of that water!

We need to go after him.

Well, don't look at me.

I just ate; I got to wait a half an hour.

Well, I just took a shower and washed my hair.

And this is leave-in conditioner.

Well, what about Jake? Jake's at his mother's.

I wish you give him a call.

There's no time!

Water's really cold.

Just so you know, we were about to come get you!

ALAN: Charlie?

You awake?

Come on, man.

It's time to get up.

Charlie?

What?

I- I didn't see you there.

She was the best thing that ever happened to me, Alan.

I understand.

But you've been up here for two days.

It's time to move on with your life.

There's no life to move on with.

Oh, sure there is.

You've got money, a beautiful home, good looks, all your hair.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I have all the things you don't.

That wasn't really the point I was trying to make, but, uh...

Come on. Come on.

Where are we going?

We are going to get you cleaned up.

No.

No, I can't go in there.

Reminds me too much of Chelsea.

The bathroom?

That's where she used to brush her hair and floss her teeth

and tinkle like a princess.

Okay.

***

I may need a new ficus.

I'm glad you came with me.

You needed to get out of the house.

No, what I need is to be loved again.

Uh, well, I think a good first step

is to stop urinating in the potted plants.

Jake, your dad's here!

Charlie, I was so sorry to hear about you and Chelsea.

Thank you.

I know that breakups can be

very difficult.

Unless you're kicking out your husband of 12 years.

That seemed remarkably easy.

It was.

You know the part that I don't understand, Judith,

is how somebody can tell you that they love you one day,

then turn around and break your heart the next.

Well, relationships are complicated.

People drift apart.

Nobody's to blame.

You blamed me.

It was your fault.

I tried to change,

tried to become the man she wanted me to be,

but it wasn't enough.

Oh, I'm sure there's a part of her

that still loves you very much.

Is there a part of you that still loves me very much?

No.

What's wrong with him?

Your uncle's very upset about his breakup.

Oh, yeah, that sucks.

Can I drive?

Sure. Cool.

Let's go, crybaby.

Hey.

Yeah, hey, kind of busy here.

I can see that.

Hi, I'm Jake's Uncle Charlie.

Nicole.

So what's the deal, Nicole?

Are you tutoring our little genius here?

No, we're dating.

Oh. Dating?

Uncle Charlie?

Hang on.

Listen, Nicole, I love this kid,

and I don't want to see him get hurt.

I'm not gonna hurt him.

Oh, really? So you like him just the way he is?

You don't want to change him at all?

Uncle Charlie...

I got your back here, buddy.

'Cause let me tell you something.

This here is a lump of clay.

And you know what it's gonna be five, ten, 20 years from now?

A larger, more bitter lump of clay.

Come on, let's go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not done.

So if you're gonna dump him, dump him now.

Don't wait till he falls in love with you

and asks you to marry him and have his children!

Okay, enjoy yourselves!

Are you out of your mind?

I mean well.

You think maybe it's time to go back to your shrink?

Why? She's just another woman that wants to change me.

Well, you have to do something.

No, no.

If I can't have Chelsea,

I don't want to live.

W- Where you going?

Strip club.

Ah, yes.

Death by lap dance.

Hey, Lord.

It's Charlie.

I know it seems like I only call on you when my ass is on fire,

but, well, let's face it,

that's how you made me.

Anyway, I'm just hurting real bad since Chelsea left,

I was kinda of hoping that maybe you could

take away some of that pain.

Even with the help of your blessed wine,

I can't get through the day.

Even your blessed vodka's stopped working.

So, anything you can do would be much appreciated.

WOMAN: Hey.

You got a light?

I like a little buzz before I pray.

Gets me closer to God.

(whispers): Thanks.

Come on, Charlie, answer the phone.

Ugh, damn it.

Voice mail.

Uh, Charlie, it's me again.

It has been three days.

Please call and let us know you're okay.

I think we should call the police.

Nah, he'll turn up.

May be broke and riddled with gonorrhea,

but he'll find his way home.

No, I-I don't think this is a typical bender.

He really cared for Chelsea.

You know, he put her in his will.

Anything happens to him, she gets everything.

Really?

So, like if he swam out in the ocean and drowned, for instance,

she gets the house?

The house, the Mercedes,

the bank accounts, music royalties.

Man, I just can't catch a break.

Hey, look what someone threw away.

Uh, put that back outside.

And wash your hands.

Welcome to your new home, baby.

Hey, everybody.

I want you to meet the love of my life,

Mrs. Charlie Harper.

Better put me down. I'm not wearing panties.

I told you he'd come home with gonorrhea.

All right, who's who?

Well, this is my brother Alan.

Alan, Betsy.

Hello, brother.

Call me Alan.

Okay.

He doesn't look like such a mooch.

Okay, well, this is my mom Evelyn,

and she doesn't look like such an Antichrist.

Hi, Mom.

Call me Mrs. Harper.

This is my housekeeper Berta.

Don't call me at all.

And lastly, this is Jake.

Oh, are you my son?!

I'll be whatever you want me to be.

Um, actually, he's my son.

Butt out, Dad.

Well, you've met everybody.

Why don't we go upstairs and continue the honeymoon.

(gasps) We have an upstairs?

CHARLIE: Yep.

Are there people up here, too?

I like her.

Hey, Dad. Mm-hmm?

Do I call Uncle Charlie's new wife Betsy or Aunt Betsy?

I guess either one's okay.

I'm gonna go with Aunt Betsy.

Fine.

Aunt Betsy made a lot of noise last night.

Uh, yeah, yeah, she did.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining.

Good morning, family.

Morning.

How we doing today?

Good. Good.

Will Aunt Betsy be joining us

or is she taking a hot, soapy shower?

She'll be right down.

So, based on this latest turn of events,

would it be fair to say you're over Chelsea?

Oh, absolutely.

Betsy and I are soul mates.

Soul mates. Uh-huh.

So, where'd you meet your soul mate?

Guess.

Strip club?

Wrong.

Massage parlor?

Wrong.

Okay, I give up.

Betsy and I met in church.

So what, she's a nun?

No, she's a stripper and part-time masseuse.

See, I drove to the strip club, but the parking lot was full

so I circled the block looking for a spot

and found one right in front of this little church.

And for some reason- I don't know why-

I got out of my car,

walked into the church and started praying.

Are you saying God sent you Betsy?

I think he did. Oh, Dad,

we gotta get our asses to church.

Then when I'm done, I get up to leave

and she appears in front of me

like some kind of vanilla-scented angel.

Mmm, vanilla.

So, we got to talking.

Turns out she's going through a difficult time as well.

Next thing I know,

we're cleaning out her locker at the strip club

and driving to Vegas.

Where you got married.

I understand your skepticism,

but I'm telling you this girl is special.

She's really sweet and spiritual.

BETSY: Charlie?

In here, baby.

Good news, bad news.

I got my period.

Oh, that's okay.

We can take a break.

We don't have to.

There's more than one way to skin a cat.

Oh, you are so wonderful.

What are the other ways?

Shh! Uh...

Charlie, uh, can I talk to you in private for a minute?

Sure.

Bets, coffee's right there.

You just make yourself at home.

Okay.

Morning, son.

Morning, Mom.

So, I was gonna do a little topless sunbathing later.

You're welcome to join me.

Okay, not to put too fine a point on it,

but you're out of your mind.

You need to call a lawyer

and get this marriage annulled immediately.

I knew you wouldn't understand.

Oh, I understand, I understand.

You're still reeling from losing Chelsea

and you're trying to fill the void

with a menstruating pole dancer.

Hey, hey, hey, that's my wife you're talking about.

Oh, damn it, Charlie, you don't know anything about her.

I know I love her and she loves me for exactly who I am.

She doesn't want to change me.

Oh, stop it.

Okay, you get one of those.

Next time, that hand comes back a bloody stump.

Charlie, please, I'm begging you.

No, I'm doing the right thing.

You're lucky you're not a girl.

Having a hoochie is like owning a vintage car.

A lot of maintenance and once a month

you gotta put down an oil pan.

Okay, I may have made a mistake.

Chelsea?

Hey, Charlie. What are you doing here?

I need to see your daughter.

I'm sorry, she's not here.

Hi, Charlie, what's going on? Ed.

You know when she'll be back?

I'm not sure.

She just took Skipper for a walk.

You're welcome to come in and wait.

Thank you.

What are you doing?

I'm just trying to be polite.

Did you ever consider that maybe she doesn't want to see him?

Watch your tone, mister.

Sit, please.

Sorry the place is a mess, we're still decorating.

I'm decorating, he's critiquing.

What, I can have opinions.

He wants me just to shup up and be pretty.

So, listen,

I'm sorry things didn't pan out with you and Chels.

Me, too.

Relationships can be a lot of work.

Even if you've known someone for 40 years.

That's right.

People get set in their pigheaded ways.

You want to get something off your chest, hmm,

I'm right here.

You really want to open this kettle of fish now?

Oh, yeah, let's open it up, open it up.

Okay.

I'm just saying that two grown men should be able to pick out

a club chair without it turning into Iwo freakin' Jima!

Well, I'm not the one that thinks that everything

he sits his ass on has to be made out of leather.

Lucky for you!

CHELSEA: Come on, Skipper.

Charlie? I'm sorry to drop in like this.

I just really needed to see you.

Okay, what's going on?

Uh, well...

Uh, why don't we go in the other room

and leave these two alone? Fine, fine.

There's no law that says we can't order the area rug later

and get two club chairs.

You see, right there.

That's why I love you.

What are you doing here?

Okay, well,

I don't know how to say this,

except just to say it.

I still love you very much, and I miss you like crazy.

I miss you too, Charlie.

Then what are we doing?

Taking some time to figure out

if we're meant to be together.

And how the hell are we supposed to do that?

I don't know.

I guess we should start dating other people.

What?!

I'm not ready to see other people.

I don't know that I am either, but I think we have to try.

Chelsea, I can't even think about dating right now.

Can I tell you something

I've learned about myself since we split up?

Sure, but first, marry me. No.

Okay, just checking.

Probably some legal complications, anyway.

What? Nothing, nothing.

Go ahead.

I've learned that I shouldn't have tried to change you.

What you need is someone who loves you for you.

No, no, no, no, no, no. I need to be changed.

There's something seriously wrong with me.

Please, Chelsea, take me back and turn me into someone else.

That wasn't a very good argument, was it?

Nope.

Well, that's the best I got.

Okay, I guess I should get going.

I'm really sorry.

That's all right.

Say goodbye to your dad for me.

I will.

They're a really cute couple.

I guess.

It's a little weird for me.

Well sure, you're probably used to seeing your dad

with your mom and not a big, handsome black guy.

He is handsome.

Hey, Chels...

I just want you to know that if by chance you should

do something crazy and stupid

like running off and marrying some stranger,

I would forgive you and take you back with open arms.

Good to know.

Seriously, I wouldn't hold it against you at all.

Thank you.

All right then.

Good-bye.

Bye.

TOM (giggling): Stop it, Ed!

Your beard tickles!

Come on, Skipper, time for another walk.

Uh, Charlie, we've got a little problem.

What's up?

This is Besty's husband.

Hello.

Want to catch me up?

Really?

Calling him Betsy's husband didn't do the trick?

I don't understand.

She never said anything about being married.

She never does.

This has happened before?

Oh, yes. Any time I find her wedding ring

inside her empty diaphragm case,

I know she's off on one of her little adventures.

I don't believe this.

Why do you put up with it?

Hey, look at me.

I'd rather share a girl like Betsy

than have an exclusive relationship

with a box of old porn magazines.

I hear you.

That would be sad.

BETSY: Hey, baby.

Hey. Hey.

Charlie, I'm really sorry.

I was less than honest with you.

Sure, let's call it less than honest.

I did enjoy our honeymoon.

Me, too.

We stayed at Bellagio.

Nice!

We should go.

Bye. Bye.

I'll make it up to you in the car.

Oh, Betsy, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

How about that?

I guess I'm not married.

I guess not.

You know what that means.

Going back to church?

That means I just got three days of unbelievable sex

with no obligations and no commitment.

Please don't make me slap you again.

Nah, go ahead.

I think I got one more coming.

That's all right.

I'm happy that things worked out for you.

Again.

Thanks.

Oh, hey, did I tell you I won 18 grand in Vegas?

(loud smacking) CHARLIE: Ouch!

- Detestero' questo film.
- Come fai a esserne cosi' certo?

Ha i sottotitoli.

I soli sottotitoli buoni sono per i nazisti,
i signori della droga colombiani

e gli alieni.

Oh, e il kung fu.

Scusa ma la NPR ha definito
"Hiroshima la poubelle"

un "incantevole viaggio alla
scoperta di noi stessi".

Non possono certo definirlo "2 ore
di festival francese del pisolino

per pomposi idioti".

Ehi, eri d'accordo che se avessi pagato i
biglietti avremmo visto quello che volevo io.

Si' perche' non pensavo potessi racimolare 18
dollari senza fermarti alla banca del sangue.

E' un piccolo prezzo da pagare
per trascinarti fuori casa.

Sono passate 3 settimane da quando tu e
Chelsea avete rotto, e devi andare avanti.

Disse l'uomo che porta ancora con
se' una foto della ex moglie nuda.

Ehi, ho pagato io quelle bocce.
Ho il diritto di guardarle di tanto in tanto.

Maledizione. Non ci credo.

- Cosa?
- E' qui.

La mia ex moglie?

No! E' Chelsea.

E' con quel Brad.

Quindi cosa facciamo? La salutiamo?

No. Ce la filiamo da qui.

Charlie?

Ehi, guarda chi c'e'.
Alan, c'e' Chelsea.

Oh, ciao, Chelsea.

Ciao, Alan.

Vi ricordate di Brad...

- Come va?
- Bene. Benissimo.

Sono trepidante per il film.

Mi stupisce vederti qui.
Questa non e' una cosa da te.

Scherzi? La NPR l'ha definito un "incantevole
viaggio alla scoperta di noi stessi".

Sai che vivo per questa roba.

Certo.

Ok, beh, e' stato bello rivederti.

Anche per me.

Che momento imbarazzante.

Non dirlo a me.

Dev'essere stata dura per te.
La tua ex fidanzata esce con un altro uomo.

Un bell'uomo.

Si'.

Tu sei qui con tuo fratello.

Lo so.

Questo si' che ti fa
strizzare le chiappe.

Oh, Dio.

Sei ancora dell'idea di andartene?

No. No, non le daro'
questa soddisfazione.

Posso ingoiare il rospo per 2 ore.

3 ore e 20 minuti.

Cosa?

Copre 4 generazioni di
ballerini kabuki transessuali.

Andiamo.

Va bene.

Ma credo che dovresti ridarmi
i soldi dei biglietti.

Non ora.

Quando preferisci tu.

<b>Two And A Half Men - Stagione 07
Episodio 17 - "I Found Your Moustache"

<b>Traduzione: Ekimus, DanKo,
Kourtney, kkekko, /Slash/

<b>::Italian Subs Addicted::
[www.italiansubs.net]

Non riesco a credere che stia
gia' uscendo con qualcuno.

Scherzi, vero?

Il giorno dopo la sua partenza sei andato a
Las Vegas e hai sposato una spogliarellista.

Le persone soffrono in
maniera diversa, Alan.

Inoltre, la spogliarellista era gia' sposata,
quindi non ho fatto niente di male.

Tutti hanno una donna tranne me.

Pronto? Neppure io ho una donna.

Pronto? Tu sei uno sfigatone
che dice "Pronto?".

- Mi chiedo se ci sia gia' andata a letto.
- Non pensarci, Charlie. Non punirti.

Beh, se non l'ha gia' fatto,
scommetto lo fara' stasera.

Ok, punisciti.

Voglio dire, quale uomo si sorbirebbe
3 ore di film gay francese

se dopo non avesse buone
speranze di fare sesso?

Non hai dato nemmeno una
possibilita' a quel film.

Scommetto che proprio ora
la sta portando a casa sua.

Staranno parlando del film.

Si stara' inventando qualche cazzata sul
perche' il film l'ha fatto piangere.

Poi la fara' entrare, le offrira' un caffe'
che diventera' un bicchiere di vino.

Una cosa porta a un'altra
e in men che non si dica

finiranno insieme nella vasca da bagno e
lui la cavalchera' come una moto d'acqua.

Almeno, io farei cosi'.

- Andiamo.
- Dove andiamo?

Da Chelsea. Devo vedere
se stasera torna a casa.

- Ok. E perche' io ci vengo?
- Pronto? Sono sbronzo.

Che idea daro' se mi beccano ubriaco alla
guida mentre vado a spiare la mia ex ragazza?

E' molto responsabile riguardo
al bere e a tampinare le donne.

Per quanto resteremo qui?

Fino a quando tornera' a casa.

E se passasse tutta la notte con Brad?

Beh, allora staremo qui tutta la notte.

No, no. Non fare quel verso...

Ehi, posso farlo se voglio farlo.

Sono stanco.

Allora dormi.

Senza la mia melatonina e il
paradenti? Non credo proprio.

Macchina, macchina, macchina.

Sono loro. Stai giu', stai giu'.

Veloce, metti questi.

- Cosa diavolo sono?
- Baffi.

Cosa ci fai con dei
baffi nel portaoggetti?

Non preoccuparti. Sono finti.

Questo non risponde alla mia domanda.

Pensi di essere stato il primo a controllare
la donna che lo ha scaricato? Ora mettili.

C'e' un lato di te del quale non
voglio proprio sapere niente.

E' un bel look per te.
Sembri un pornodivo degli anni '70.

Immagino.

Ma guarda cosa guida.

- Cosa? E' una Prius.
- Certo che e' una Prius.

"Salvo il pianeta.
Posso giocare con le tue tette?"

Non criticare lo stile
di vita ecologico.

Ho lavorato sodo per ridurre
il mio impatto ambientale.

Sei uno scroccone e un avaro.
Non cercare di farlo sembrare trendy.

Ok, stanno uscendo dalla macchina.

Non si veste in modo splendido?

Voglio dire, giovanile,
ma senza sforzarsi troppo.

A differenza di certa gente.

Oh, grande. Si stanno baciando.

E' un bene che lui non sappia
dove e' stata la sua bocca.

Aspetta un minuto.

Sta tornando nella sua macchina.

E ora se ne va.

Permesso negato, signor
culattone amico di Greenpeace!

Ecco. Ti senti meglio?
Adesso possiamo andare a casa?

Solo un minuto. Voglio
essere sicuro che entri.

Sai, c'e' un lato gentile di
te che posso soltanto lodare.

Non lo mostri molto spesso,
ma quando lo fai, illumina il mondo.

Aspetta un minuto.

Perche' sta salendo in macchina?

Dove sta andando a quest'ora?

Forse c'e' un terzo uomo
e lei sta tradendo Brad.

- Cosa?
- Non e' come faresti tu?

Seguila.

- Vai, vai, la stai perdendo.
- Rilassati.

Non e' la prima donna che
ho seguito furtivamente,

pur rispettando alla lettera
l'ordinanza restrittiva.

Sembra che stia andando a Malibu.

- Chi conosce a Malibu?
- Non ne ho idea.

- Cosa diavolo e'?
- Dannazione.

- Ho finito la benzina.
- Come puoi avere finito la benzina?

Non lo so. Ci ho messo tre
dollari l'altro giorno.

Tre dollari?

In realta' erano 2 dollari e 50.
Ho comprato una barretta Milky Way.

Merda!

Va bene, dobbiamo solo
chiamare l'assistenza.

Non hai l'assistenza?
Costa 49 dollari all'anno.

Charlie, faccio benzina
tre dollari alla volta.

Ottimo! Proprio ottimo!

Tu hai l'assistenza?

Per la Mercedes ho l'assistenza oro
o platino, o qualcosa del genere.

Quindi? E loro non verranno ad aiutarci?

Chissa' se la Mercedes verra' ad assisterci
per rifornire di benzina una Volvo dell'89.

Li chiamo per chiederlo.

Ti aspetti davvero che chiami, vero?

No.

Andiamo. Ci tocca farcela a piedi.

Cioe', dovrei abbandonare la mia
auto sul ciglio della strada?

E se qualcuno prova a rubarla?

Ottima idea. Lascia le chiavi, soldi per la
benzina e un biglietto di ringraziamento.

Cosi' ha parlato quello
che ha l'assicurazione.

I piedi... mi fanno un male cane.

Beh, e' quello che ti meriti per aver
indossato quei costosi mocassini italiani.

Non sono adatti per camminare.

Hai ragione.

Ciao, Charlie.

Chels?

Ehi, zio Charlie, sembri un
pornodivo degli anni '70.

Immagino.

Che ci fai qui?

Ho bisogno di parlarti.

Va bene. Che succede?

Oh, andiamo, Jake.
Diamo loro un po' di privacy.

Perche'? Pensi che lo
faranno sul divano?

Ok, il motivo e' questo.

Vederti stasera mi ha fatto
capire quanto mi manchi.

Davvero?

Io ti manco?

Oh, certo, non fa che
piangere come una ragazzina.

Vai via!

Cosa? Sto dalla tua parte!

Beh, vedo che qui non e' cambiato nulla.

Beh, solo che tu non ci sei piu'.

E si', mi manchi e piango
come una ragazzina.

Bene.

Allora, che hai fatto ultimamente?

Non molto. Come e' vivere con
tuo padre e il suo ragazzo?

E' un po' strano.

Immagino. Due ex marinai
che ci danno dentro.

Le mura sono piuttosto sottili.

Ogni notte sento: "Periscopio
su, periscopio giu'!"

"Lancia il siluro".

Basta con le chiacchiere.
Cosa c'e' fra te e Brad?

Lui e' fantastico, ma...

non e' la stessa cosa.

Voi due avete...

No.

Togliti quel sorriso dalla faccia.

Toglimelo tu.

Dovrai fare molto di piu'.

- Una domanda.
- Si'?

Perche' quei baffi?

Non voglio essere riconosciuto
quando esco con Alan.

Ehi, lo stanno facendo
davvero sul divano.

Quindi, come stanno le cose
fra zio Charlie e Chelsea?

Sono tornati insieme o
era solo una botta e via?

Che ne sai di "botta e via"?

Teoricamente, tutto.

Oh, cavolo.

- Cosa?
- Sono solo un po' delusa.

Ho visto l'auto di Chelsea fuori,
non ho visto la tua.

E' stata qui stanotte, ma non sappiamo se
sono tornati insieme o se e' solo uno sfizio.

Che ne sai tu di "sfizi"?

E' un rapporto sessuale, papa'.
Perche' facciamo questi giochetti?

Buongiorno a tutti.

- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

Cosa c'e'?

Avanti. Parla.

Non c'e' niente da dire.

E' passata, ha detto che le mancavo
e ha trascorso la notte qui.

- Quindi torna a vivere qui?
- Volete ancora sposarvi?

O ci avete solo dato dentro come ricci?

Che problemi hai?

Sono nell'eta' critica.

- Buongiorno a tutti.
- Buongiorno.

Ehi, vuoi del caffe'?

Devo andare a casa a
cambiarmi per il lavoro.

- Oh, ok.
- Possiamo parlare?

Si', certo.

Oh, non e' mai una buona cosa.

E tu cosa ne sai?

E' la stessa cosa che mamma disse a te.

Stavo pensando, prendi delle
cose da tuo padre per stasera

e poi riportiamo tutto il
resto qui nel weekend.

Charlie, io non ritorno stasera.

Perche' no? Ieri sera
e' andata bene, no?

Benissimo, ma non ha
risolto i nostri problemi.

Di sicuro ha risolto i miei.

Non che non ti ami, ma non sono ancora
sicura se avremo un futuro insieme.

Chelsea, mi stai davvero
facendo impazzire.

Devo andare.

Andiamo, aspetta.

Ho trovato i tuoi baffi.

Dov'erano?

Dove pensi che fossero?
Erano attaccati al mio sedere.

Ehi.

Ehi.

Ti va di parlare?

No, non mi va.

Comprensibile.

Devi ammettere che ora la situazione e'
migliore di com'era ieri alla stessa ora.

Voglio dire, 24 ore fa la donna che
ami era fuori con un altro uomo.

Ma magicamente lei e' finita
a passare la notte con te.

Ovviamente poi e' venuta la mattina e ancora
una volta ti ha mollato come uno stronzo.

Scusami.

Non volevi parlare.

Io invece sono l'opposto.

Quando ho il cuore
spezzato devo parlare.

Non puoi fermarmi.

Scusami.

Ho provato a fare il tipo
forte e silenzioso ma...

non e' la mia natura.

E poi ci sono manifestazioni fisiche
quando si reprimono i sentimenti.

Cose tipo stitichezza, emicrania...

O succede l'opposto: gas, diarrea...

Sono cose imprevedibili.

Sono come tiramenti di culo emotivi.

Tiramenti di culo.

Mi e' venuta di getto,
direttamente dal cervello.

Ho capito.

Ma tu sei fortunato.

Hai la tua musica per
esprimere quello che provi.

Voglio dire, potresti suonare
il blues, per esempio.

# La mia ragazza mi ha lasciato. #

# Non tornera'. #

Che succede?

# Sto soffocando tuo padre. #

Sto solo dicendo che ogni volta che tocca a
me raccogliere la cacca ne fa una montagna.

Beh, smettila di fargli
mangiare il chili.

- Oh, ehi, Charlie.
- Ehi, Charlie.

Ehi, Tom. Ed.

Stai cercando Chelsea?

No, e' venuto a vedere due vecchie
regine che portano a passeggio il cane.

Chi hai chiamato regina, Elisabetta?

Non e' qui, Charlie.
E' andata a cena con quel Brad.

Oh.

Vuoi entrare a farti una birra?

- No, non vorrei disturbarvi, ragazzi.
- Non fare lo sciocco, entra.

Ok, grazie.

Dovevi proprio dirgli che e' con Brad?

Cosa dovevo fare, mentire?

No, ma potevi stare zitto.

Voglio dire, guarda quel poveraccio.

Mi dispiace. Non ci ho pensato.

"Non ci ho pensato". Dovrebbe
essere il tuo secondo nome.

Non offendermi mentre tengo in
mano un sacchetto di cacca.

Prendo qualche birra.

Chelsea mi ha detto di ieri sera.

Non riesco a capire, Tom.
Pensavo fossimo tornati insieme.

Gia', beh, non potrai mai
comprendere appieno una donna.

Sono come bellissimi
puzzle con pezzi mancanti.

O grandi libri senza finale.

O come diceva mio padre:
"Sono tutte dannatamente pazze".

Non so cosa fare. Devo lasciarla
in pace? Devo inseguirla?

Se posso intervenire...

direi che presentarsi senza preavviso,

con dei fiori presi al negozio di alcolici
sembra un gesto piuttosto disperato.

Lo so, lo so. E' solo che non potevo
stare a casa senza far niente.

Ci penso sempre. Cosa ho fatto di sbagliato?
Cosa avrei potuto fare diversamente?

Cavolo, quante volte mi sono fatto
questa domanda quando ero sposato.

Anch'io.

Quanti anni di matrimonio abbiamo alle
spalle, 80 anni contando me e te?

Vediamo, io sono stato
con Beth per 38 anni,

e tu sei stato con Martha 40, 41...

Non volevo che facessi
i conti sul serio.

Non urlarmi contro o
ti spacco la faccia.

Fatti sotto, signore.

Forse e' meglio che vada.

No, no, no, siediti. Finisci la birra.

- Non facciamo sul serio.
- Adoro questo vecchio figlio di puttana.

Oh, per l'amor di Dio, non comportarti
da gay davanti agli ospiti.

Adesso ascoltami, giovanotto.

In fin dei conti non importa cosa
hai fatto o cosa non hai fatto.

Vuoi riconquistare Chelsea?

Devi farle sentire la tua mancanza,
come e' successo la scorsa notte.

E non sentira' la tua mancanza se ti presenti
in casa sua con un triste mazzo di petunie.

Quindi dovrei pensare agli affari miei

e sperare che un giorno si fara'
viva e dira' "sono tornata"?

Oppure puoi fare come
abbiamo fatto io e Ed.

Cambiare squadra.

E' molto piu' facile vivere
con un uomo che con una donna.

Tom e io vediamo gli stessi programmi
in TV. Ci piace lo stesso cibo.

Non devi uscire dalla
stanza per scoreggiare.

Beh, non sei obbligato,
ma di sicuro sarebbe una buona idea.

Ok, grazie ragazzi.

Siete stati di grande aiuto.

Ci saremo sempre per te, Charlie.

Grazie.

E non dite a Chelsea che sono passato.

Neanche per sogno.

E ricorda cosa ti abbiamo detto.
Non farti vedere per un po' di tempo.

- Saro' invisibile come un sottomarino.
- Ci siamo capiti.

Beh, tu che dici?

Guardiamo Sports Center e
poi ci divertiamo un po'?

Devi...

Devi prendere il Viagra?

Sei tu il mio Viagra, tesoro.

Oh, sei cosi' dolce.

Solo per questo ti faccio
tenere il telecomando.

Ehi.

Scusa, non volevo disturbarti.
Prendo una bottiglia d'acqua.

No, no, no, non fa niente.
Vieni, siediti qui con me.

Sul serio?

Certo, siediti.

Ok.

Ascolta...

Volevo scusarmi per... insomma...

Aver cercato di uccidermi
con un cuscino?

Era solo per scherzo,
non prenderla seriamente.

Quello che voglio dire e' che so che
tentavi di tirarmi su e... ti ringrazio.

Grazie.

Capisco che ti rendo la vita difficile
per il fatto che vivi qui ma...

a essere sinceri, probabilmente
e' un bene per me...

averti vicino.

Caspita, Charlie...

Per me e' importante sentirtelo dire.

Beh...

Ti...

Ti voglio bene, amico.

Anch'io ti voglio bene.

Lo so, lo so.

Vorrei che questo
momento non finisse mai.

Ok.

Dico sul serio. Non ti lascio andare.

Beh, forse e' meglio che tu lo faccia
perche' la cosa comincia a diventare strana.

Non abbiamo bisogno delle donne.
Abbiamo l'un l'altro.

Va bene, te la sei cercata.

Non preoccuparti,
ti aspettero' nell'aldila'.

.......... ********** ..........

from your child support
check this month.

Because I paid
for Jake's haircut.

Yes, it is usually nine dollars,

but he wanted to go someplace
without hobbyhorses.

I know he's never gonna win
any beauty contests,

but he is our son.

Look, I've got a patient.
I got to go.

Sorry you had to hear that.

That's, uh, that's my ex-wife.

Bee-yatch.

Hello, Mrs. Honeycutt.
I'm Dr. Harper.

Doctor.

Okay, so you are having
spasms in your lower back?

Yeah, it's awful.

Some days I can't
even get out of bed.

Oh, I know how that is.

You have back problems, too?

No.

Anyway, why don't
you lie face down,

and we'll see if we
can locate the problem.

I've tried everything.

Acupuncture,

yoga, shiatsu.

Nothing seems to work.

Not surprised.

Those Eastern practices
are mostly hooey.

Modern chiropractic,
on the other hand,

is built on over 50 years
of solid science.

Okay, let's take a look
at what we've got here.

Okay, now is this
too much pressure?

No.

Okay, how about this?

No.

Okay, now is this
where the spasms occur?

A little lower.

Okay.

Here?

Lower.

Here?

Am I hurting you?

No! God, no!

Nobody's touched me like this
since my husband died.

Oh, um, I'm so sorry.

Um, how long has
it been since...?

That long, huh?

Oh, my, it's, uh, pretty...
pretty sensitive here.

Harder!

Oh, okay, no problem. Um...

So, just out of curiosity,
how did you find me?

Uh, referral?
Uh, my Web site?

Or the fliers
on the counter

of the Mongolian barbecue
across the street?

Shut up and rub!

Uh, I'm not technically rubbing.

Whoa!
Whoa, Nellie. Whoa!

Don't stop!
I'm not stopping.

Oh, spank me!

I'm-m sorry?

Spank my lonely ass!

What?!
Do it, bitch!

Yes, Doctor, harder!

Yes!

Oh, God, yes!

Okay, let's take a look
at the schedule.

See what the, uh, rest of
the afternoon looks like.

Oh, that's not too bad.

So, how are you liking
your first day at work here?

Thank you, Dr. Harper.

Uh, you are most welcome.

A- And remember, alternating
an ice pack with a heating pad

is, uh, very helpful
for spasming.

I'd like to make
another appointment.

Oh, sure, sure. Uh...

What were you thinking?
Maybe next week, or...?

Tonight.

Uh, tonight?

Oh, oh, gloriosky.

Uh, uh... well, we, uh...
we close up at 5:00, so...

So I can expect you
at my place at 9:00.

Oh, gee. Uh, I-I don't
do house calls.

Per se.

See you at 9:00.

Uh, some patients pay in cash.

Uh, uh, their insurance, uh,
won't cover chiropractic.

Uh, part of our ongoing
health care crisis.

Tragic, really.

Uh, by the way, you are doing
one heck of a job.

In fact, here's a little
something for you.

Just 'cause your smile
lights up the place.

You know what?
Let's sweeten the pot.

Um, can you give me ten back?

Not a problem.

Can't put a price on a smile.

Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

I like the new look.

Thanks.

It's fashion forward.

What does that mean?

I don't know.

It's what the guy
who cut my hair said.

He also said
it was "fun and fabulous."

Really?

Yeah, and he invited Dad
to a party.

I didn't go.

It's just nice to be asked.

So, why'd you decide to abandon
your classic cereal bowl coif?

What's a "coif"?

You can't glean it
from the context?

What's "glean"?

Why'd you change
your freakin' hair?

My new girlfriend
wanted me to.

If your new girlfriend
wanted you

to jump off a bridge,
would you do that?

If she put her tongue in my
mouth when she asked me, yeah.

Well, I can't blame you.

I once bought a woman a car
for the same reason.

She put her tongue
in your mouth?

Sure, let's say mouth.

Can we get
the check, please?

Hey, why don't you let
me get this one?

Really? You're not going
to go for the world record?

What are you talking about?

1,647 meals in a row

where you haven't taken out
your stupid Velcro wallet.

You were counting?

Am I close?

Nevertheless, I'm paying.

You smell that, Jake?

The air coming out
of your father's wallet

has been in there since
before you were born.

Very funny.

Thank you.

Wait, wait, wait.

Nobody is going to believe this.

For God's sake.

Hey, isn't that
Chelsea's friend, Gail?

Oh, yeah.

I wonder if I should
say hello.

I wouldn't mind
saying hello.

Finish paying the
check, you weasel.

Hey, Dad, as long as you
got your wallet out,

I could use
some new sneaks.

Hmm. Oh...

Sure.

Are you dying?

Charlie.

Oh, hi, Gail.

Great to see you.

How've you been?

Pretty good. You?

Well, you know...

Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
about you and Chelsea.

The way it goes.

Win some, lose some.

Start having liquor delivered
straight to your house-

you don't have
to put on pants.

Well, if it's any consolation,
I know how you feel.

I'm still not over
my breakup.

But I'm not much
of a drinker, so...

Cheers.

Have you, uh...
have you seen Chelsea?

Yeah, actually I had
dinner with her, and...

We had dinner
just the other night.

Her and Brad?

Yeah, come to think
of it, he was there.

Looks like they're
an item now.

I guess.

You guess?

What do you want
from me, Charlie?

They're in Mexico
for the weekend.

Mexico. Nice.

I went there with
her once.

I'm sorry.

No, no, no, no, it's fine.

We had a great time.

In fact, when we got
back, I bought her a car.

Yeah, she told me.

Ooh...

Listen, I got to go, but...

if you ever want to talk.

Oh, thank you.

Bye.
Bye-bye.

For the last time, I am not
dying and I'm not sick.

Everything's fine.

Okay, I got it.

But you can understand
my skepticism, right?

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

I really don't see why
I shouldn't ask her out.

Seriously? The woman is
Chelsea's best friend.

So?

She's single, I'm single.
She's lonely, I'm lonely.

She's gorgeous,
I'm well above average.

I'm just saying it's a bad idea.

I never said
it wasn't a bad idea.

I said I don't know why
I shouldn't do it.

What's that?

That's a portable massage table.

So, what, you're givin'
rub-and-tugs on the pier now?

No.

No, I am a licensed
professional,

and-and I will not stand here

and be accused
of unethical behavior.

I mean, just because you have
no moral compass

doesn't mean I don't.

And while, yes,
that's a triple negative,

it nevertheless defines me

as the man for whom
I am aiming to be!

What the hell
are you talking about?

I am just trying
to augment my income

by seeing clients
in their homes,

thus alleviating them of the
added stress of commuting,

not to mention speed bumps
and potholes, of which,

as you know,
can jostle the spine!

Wow, guy picks up one $30 check
and he has a brain aneurysm.

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

Yeah?

Chelsea?

Hey! How are ya?

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
slow down, slow down.

Why are you crying?

Wait a minute.

You're in Mexico?

Why on Earth are you in Mexico?

Oh, sure, Brad.

Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry
it's not working out.

Well, I love you
and I miss you, too.

When are you gonna be back?

Okay, okay,
I'll-I'll see you tomorrow.

I... can't wait.

All right, bye-bye, sweetie.

I hope that smile's
for me.

Uh, who else
would it be for?

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

You ready for round two?

Well, um...
yes and no.

Something wrong?

Yeah.

While you were in
the bathroom,

uh, Chelsea called.

Really?

Apparently, things didn't
go well in Mexico,

and she's coming home.

Well, that's a shame.

Yeah.

Anyway, she wants
to see me.

Said she loves me
and misses me.

So, one call and you're just
gonna go running back?

Um, yeah.

Well... this is awkward.

Come on. You know how
I feel about her.

I do.

So, we should probably keep
what happened tonight

just between us, right?

Mum's the word?

Zip the lip?

Ixnay on the oggie day
aisle stay?

Of course.

You know,
we could just pretend

that you didn't get
the phone call

for, like, another hour.

We could, couldn't we?

But wouldn't that
be... wrong?

I won't tell
if you don't.

Uh, I'm sorry, Gail.

I can't, I can't
justify it to myself.

Okay.

Well, can I at least kiss
you good night?

Sure.

On the other hand,

there's no arguing
with a boner.

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

Let's see.

When Gail came over,

it was 11:00 here
and midnight in Cabo.

When Chelsea called,

it was midnight here
and 1:00 in Cabo.

So when I did Gail at 12:10,

Chelsea technically
hadn't called yet.

Not my best work,
but I can live with it.

Hey.

Tough night, Bunky?

I'm a whore, Charlie.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

Jake needed a haircut,
and you had no money.

What? No, no!

I took money
to give a woman pleasure.

Wait a minute.

You... gave a woman pleasure?

Oh, you have no idea what
powerful orgasms

these hands are capable
of delivering.

No, no, no.
I've always known that.

I just find it hard to believe

they could give them
to other people.

Yeah, well, maybe this'll
convince you.

A woman gave you this?

Uh-huh, right before she told me

she was done with me and I could
show myself out.

Sounds like a dream date to me.

So what's the problem?

How do I live with myself?

How did you live with yourself
before?

By thinking I was better
than you.

Now after all these years, I've
finally descended to your level.

Oh, no-no-no, no, no.

I may have done some
questionable things in my life,

but I have never taken money
for it.

That's not to say
it wasn't offered.

Deservedly so.

Fine, I'm worse than you.

That's all I'm saying.

Well, I am going
to take a shower

and try to wash
the cheapness off me.

Better take some steel wool
and a cheese grater.

Hey, Alan.

Oh, Gail...

Hi.

Don't judge me, Pretty Woman.

Charlie, I better
get going.

Right, right.

So, uh, you and I are okay?

Yeah. I'm just sorry
it has to end.

Yeah, me, too.

Chelsea's a lucky girl.

You think so?
You should tell her.

I mean, don't tell her.

Bye.

Bye-bye.

Thank you, Charlie.

For what?

Proving once again that
I am better than you.

Hey, hey, I'm just a rascal!

You are a male prostitute!

That is a terribly hurtful thing
to say.

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

So there we are in this
beautiful hotel room

overlooking the ocean,

and he's on the phone
with his mother trying

to help her download music
to her iPod.

You're kidding!

And I just sat there thinking,

"Charlie would never do this.

Charlie hates his mother
with a blind passion!"

Remember when you used to think
that was a bad thing?

And when Brad's not on the phone
with his mother,

he's telling me how much
I remind him of his mother.

I hope not while
you were in bed,

'cause that would reflect badly
on everybody.

You don't wanna know.

There's nothing to know.

You went to Mexico
with another man,

he talked about his mother
in bed,

and you didn't have sex
with him.

Charlie...

Nope! That's what happened.
End of story.

I should never have let zou go.

Well, sometimes you can't
appreciate what you've got

until you go to Mexico and don't
have sex with a mama's boy.

I'm sorry about Brad.

I know that hurt you.

Ah, it's water under the bridge.

What you did, what I did,
doesn't matter.

What did you do?

Doesn't matter.

Charlie, no secrets.

Please, can't I just have one?

Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter.

We were separated.

All right, here goes.

I was having pizza with Alan
and Jake the other day.

By the way,
Jake got a new haircut.

It's just fabulous.

Okay, well, you'll never guess
who was there getting takeout.

Your old buddy Gail.

Oh, my God, you didn't.

I didn't say I did,
but good guess.

I don't believe you!

What?! We were separated.

You were in Mexico
with another man.

But she's my best friend!

Yeah, well, I'd have to say
the jury's still out on that.

You are such a pig!

A- A-A pig who hates his mother.

Go to hell!

Oh, come on!

It was 1:00 in Cabo!

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

Oh! Lower.

How about here?

Oh, yeah...

that's how
Mommy likes it.

Okay, you know what?

I'm sorry.
I- I can't do this.

What's wrong?

I am a professional.

I studied chiropractic

for three years
in Guadalajara.

And that was with almost no
Spanish language skills

and a family of parasites
living in my colon.

And I did not go through
all of that

to become some sort
of G-spot Johnny.

Is that what you think you are?

Well, you're giving me money,
and I'm giving you...

what I'm giving you.

It just, it makes me feel cheap.

So it's too much
like a business transaction.

Exactly.

Well, how about
we forget the money,

and I'll show you something
I learned in Guadalajara?

What?

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Ai, yi, yi, yi! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Canta y no llores... ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

Oh, hey, hi.

I'm sorry.

I overreacted.

Yeah, you kinda did.

You're both single,
you're both adults,

and you and I were separated.

Plus you were honest with me, so
I'm willing to put it behind us.

Oh, thank you. Thank you!

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

Why don't I take you out

for a nice lunch
and we'll catch up?

You wanna go out?

I'm a little hungry.

Aren't you a little hungry?

Gail's upstairs, isn't she?

Once again, we were separated
and I was vulnerable!

Just so we're on the same page,

are we still together or am I
allowed to go back upstairs?!

Oh, damn!

Oh, how much madder
could she get?

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª Men. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂª

Okay, well, I think
we're making good progress

with the back spasms.

Thank you, Doctor.
I'll see you on Wednesday.

Looking forward to it.

Uh, and Mrs. Honeycutt?
Yes?

Uh, if
it's okay with you,

I think I'd like to go back
to our original arrangement.

But you said
it made you feel cheap.

What can I say?
Turns out I am cheap.

Your call. Bye-bye.

Bye.

Have I told you lately that you
are doin' a great job?

'Cause you are doin'
a great job!

In fact, I am going to make you
employee of the month.

I want an adjustment.

Uh, I'm sorry.

Are-Are you having
back problems?

No, I want an adjustment
like you give her.

Oh, gee, I-I don't think
that would be appropriate.

All right, then I want a raise
and dental insurance.

Who the hell are you?

Oh, this is my

He plays drums.

Okay.

That explains the bad attitude.

What, you're ragging

No, I'm ragging

Now, beat it. I'busy.

This does suck.

Hey.

Jake's friend show up?

Yeah, he's here.

When's he leaving?

I said he could spend the night.

Really? Did you consider
clearing it with me?

You would have said no
to Jake having a friend over?

If you recall, seven years ago,
I said no to having Jake over.

And yet, here he is,
so what's the point in asking?

Fine.

What do we know
about the little drummer boy?

Not much. Jakes says he's one
of the cool kids at school.

Then, why is he
hanging out with Jake?

Are you saying
my son's not cool?

I'm saying your son
got his tongue stuck

to the freezer last weekend.

That could have happened
to anybody.

Anybody who tried to pick up
an Eskimo Pie with their tongue.

His hands were full.

With a HoneyBaked Ham.

Okay, so he's not cool.

And he eats a lot of crap.

And his grades aren't the best.

And his personal hygiene
is a little sketchy.

Is there a "but" coming?

But he's my son,

and I love him.

(chuckles)

What's so funny?

Mom says the same thingabou.

Really? Mom says she loves me?

from your fridge,

go down to the beach
and get wasted.

Okay, but I got to warn you,

I get kind of stupid
when I drink.

Don't worry.ou can leave
the thinking to me.

Hey, you know what?

It does rhyme with "ditch."

What does?

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

BOY (over TV):
Daddy, is Mr. Boots dead?

MAN: Well, Jay Bob, you did
throw him out of a moving car.

That's never good
for a housecat.

(audience laughing)

JAY BOB: I thought they were
supposed to land on their feet.

MAN: And that's what
he was trying to do

when he bounced off
the FedEx truck.

But let me see what I can do.

Cover your eyes.
JAY BOB: Okay.

(high-pitched whirring)

(cat meows)

JAY BOB:
Mr. Boots, you're okay!

MAN: Just remember, he's
ly got five lives left.

(laughter)

Maybe my song
doesn't suck enough.

Hey.

So, where's Jake
and Eldridge?

Beats me.

Last I saw them,
they were stealing beer

out of the fridge
and sneaking out the back.

They stole beer?

They had to.
I locked up the hard stuff.

Charlie!

Relax. How drunk can they get
off a 12-pack?

(sighs)

Damn it.

This had to be
Eldridge's idea.

Jake would never think of it
on his own.

That's true.

Last bright idea he had

was to pick up an Eskimo Pie
with his tongue.

I better go look for them.

Good idea.

Embarrass him in front
of his only guy friend.

Eldridgeisn't his o.

Who else does he hang out with?

And you can't count you, me,
orilitary recruiters.

So, what, I'm supposed
to do nothing?

They have to be punished.

Don't worry. The alcohol
will punish them plenty.

Yeah, that's really worked
for you.

Trust me, Alan:
inside, I'm suffering.

Oh, the agony.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(retching)

Beer's not so cool now, is it?

Leave me alone.

And you-

what is your mother
going to say?

(retching)

For God's sake,
that's wicker!

(chuckling):
Hey.

How are we all doing in here?

(Jake and Eldridge retching)

You should have stopped them
when you had the chance.

And miss out on this?

How's it hanging,
Alfalfa?

(retching)

And you call yourself a drummer.

Keith Moon is vomiting
in his grave.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(playing romantic melody)

That's really beautiful,
Charlie.

Thanks.

I wrote it before
I got kicked out of Juilliard.

I got to ask:

how'd you go from writing
something like that

to jingles and kid music?

Well, after I left school,

I came back to L.A.
hoping to write film sres.

But I met this advertising guy

who needed a song
about toothpaste.

Before I knew it, I was rhyming

"exhilaration"
with "constipation."

"Open doors" with "cold sores."

And one I am particularly
proud of,

"make a switch"
with "feminine itch."

I hear you.

When I came out here,
I was hoping to be a dancer.

(stops playing)
Really?

Yeah.

Then I met pot and doughnuts.

Before I knew it,
I was scrubbing toilets

and hosing teenage bf
out of wicker baskets.

Rhyme that, Beethoven.

Ã¢ÂÂª A tisket, a tasket Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª I'm barfing in a basket. Ã¢ÂÂª

That's what pays
your salary, baby.

(doorbell ringing)

All ght, this
is Eldridge's mom.

I'm going to give her
a piece of my mind.

Oh, just let it go.

No, no. This is poor parenting
on her part,

and she needs to know about it.

Hi. I'm here
to pick up Eldridge.

I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

ouble?

He was an angel.
Come on in.

Ã¢ÂÂª Superdad. Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

Thank you so much, Alan.

Well, hey, Eldridge
is welcome anytime.

We single parents
have to stick together.

Yeah.
See you, buddy.

Yeah, bite me.

I heard that, young man.

Good for you.
Get in the car.

Can I drive?
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

You suck!
And you're ruining my life!

Okay, bye-bye.

Yes?

What happened to giving her
a piece of your mind?

Oh, come on.
We both know what happened.

Right.

Piece of tail always trumps
piece of mind, doesn't it?

What do you want from me?

She's a beautiful woman.

She's been through
a tough divorce.

She raising a teenage son
by herself.

Last thing she needs

is me dumpinmore
problems in her lap.

So, what are your plans
for her lap?

I don't know.
I... I might call her.

We'll see.

You're unbelievable.

Your son finally gets a friend,

and you're going to tr
to nail his mother?

All right, okay, first of all,

with a classy woman like
Lyndsey, there's no nailing.

There's, uh...
there's dating and bonding

and-and getting
to know one another.

And then, you know, eventually
consummating the relationship

with mutual respect and caring.

Oh, grow up.

This is a hot divorced mom
from the Valley.

You're going to need
three penises

and a set of jumper cables
just to get her attention.

Oh, you're disgusting.

Hey, I'm not the one trying

to bang the drummer's mom
slowly.

Don't you judge me.

Why not?

You've slept with one
of Jake's teachers,

his den mother,
his karate instructor,

his ballet teacher,
and his aunt.

Great. So five wrongs
make a right.

What?

If I jump off a bridge and land
on top of some broad Jake knows,

that makes it okay
for you to do it, too?

What?

I think I've made my point.

What?

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

I'm never gonna drink again.

Quitter.

Charlie?

Oh, right.

Atta boy.

Here's your wastebasket.

I rinsed it out,

but there are still some
tiny chunks in the weave.

Maybe you could use
your dad's Waterpik.

Give the kid a break, Berta.

He's hung over.

Oh, the poor dear.

Next time, tell your friends
to puke out the window.

Want to know
a surefire hangover cure?

Never stop drinking.

Charlie?

Let me finish.

Or never start
in the first place.

See how I turned that around?

Bring it home, Dr. Cosby.

All right, for starters,

you and Eldridge stole beer
that did not belong to you.

That is not how I raised you.

Now to the issue
of underage drinking.

Not only is it against the law,
alcohol destroys brain cells.

Alan, Alan,

you gotta tailor the pitch
to the audience.

What do you mean?

Forget brain cells.

Jake, listen to me.
This is very important.

You're kidding.

I can't tell you
how many times I've said,

"This has never happened
before."

Huh.

Where are you going?

To check out your theory.

Remember: he's your son,
and you love him.

Ã¢ÂÂª Up, up, and away in my... Ã¢ÂÂª

Dr. Alan Harper.
May I help you?...

Oh, oh, hi, Lyndsey.

No, no, you're
not interrupting.

Just doin' some
stomach crunches.

Hang on.

And... a thousand.

So what's up?

Uh, tonight?

Sure, sure, I'd love to.

Yeah, yeah, I know that place.

8:00? Perfect.

See you then.

(chuckles)
How about that?

She called me.
Wants to have drinks.

Nice.
What are you gonna tell Jake?

Who?

I mean, what do you mean?

I mean, are you gonna te him

you're hookin' up
with his buddy's mom?

Okay, first of a, nobody said
anything about hooking up.

It's just drinks.

And-and second of all, Jake nt
out and had drinks last night

and didn't tell me.

Man, that's the most lame-ass
rationalization

for questionable behavior
I've ever heard from you.

Yeah, so?

Kudos.

Hey, Uncle Charlie?
You were wrong.

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

It is so nice to get out
of the house

and spend time
with another grownup.

I know.

It's hard to be a single parent.

Thankless, really.

Oh, tell me about it.

Dealing with the ex.

Setting boundaries.

The loneliness.

e frustration.

It's all worth it though.

u're so dirty!
e frustration.

I'm a dirty mom!

My son is the greatest
gift of my life.

Mine, too.

I can't imagine loving anything
more than I love Jake.

To our children.

Our children.

(gasping)
Tell me I'm a good mom!

Oh, you're a good mom!

I'm a dirty mom!

Oh, you're so dirty!

(toilet flushes)

Uh, whoopsie!

Automatic flusher.

(gasping):
Do, do that again!

Okay.

(toilet flushes)

Not the toilet!

Sorry! Sorry!

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(plays srt arpeggio)

Hey!

Hey-hey-hey-hey-
hey-hey!

Aren't you grounded?

Um, I think that's just
when my dad's here.

Get in the house...

all of you.

I thought you were cool.

No, you didn't.

How old are you?

Sixteen.

What about you?
Same.

That's what I thought.

We were just goin' down
to the beach.

Nobody asked you.

I want you
to listen to this

and tell me if it makes you
wanna watch the TV show.

(plays rollicking melody)

Ã¢ÂÂª Larry was just a single dad Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Till a toxic spil

BOTH: Oh, my

Absolutely fantastic.
Yeah, I would so watch that.

You wrote that?

You think?

BOTH: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

Oh, yeah, really makes you
wanna see the show.

Thanks. Thank you.

All right, well, I guess
you guys all wanna get going.

Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Yeah.

Psst, Jake.

Yeah?

If you've got a choice,
take the tall one.

Why?

Trust me.

It's my superpower.

Thanks.

(plays chord)

Super uncle!

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

Ã¢ÂÂª Men. Ã¢ÂÂª

(audience cheering or TV)

I'm back.

Oh, good.
I was starting to worry.

How'd it go with Jake?

Hardly knew he was here.

Can you keep a secret?

The real question is
"Can I remember a secret?"

You were right.

That's no secret.

I- I mean about Lyndsey.

Who's Lyndsey?

Eldridge's mom.

Who's Eldridge?

Jake's friend.

The drummer?

Anyway, we did wind up
having sex.

You and me?

You really need
to get into a program.

It's not funny anymore.

Humor is very subjective.

Come on. Be serious.

I'm just telling y
about Lyndsey

because I may need you
to cover for me with Jake.

Don't worry.
I got your back.

ThanksCharlie.

Good night.

Is he gone?

Who?

Dad.

Oh. Yeah.

Thanks.

Don't worry. I got your back.

Good night.

What just happened?

.......... ********** ..........

(chuckles)

I can't believe this is
only our second date.

I know, I feel like I've
known you all my life.

Me, too.

I'm assuming you mean
that as a good thing.

Absolutely.

(both moan)

You're such an unexpected
surprise in my life, Alan.

Oh, thank you.

Uh, once again, I'm
assuming that's good.

(laughs)

It's great.

(both moaning)

Do you always wear
your socks in bed?

Oh, oh, no, it's just one of
my toenails is kind of snaggly

and I didn't want to
scratch you with it.

Oh, okay.

Had I known we were
going to make love,

I would have slapped a corn
pad on the little bugger.

(chuckles)

(door opens)

BOY:
Mom!
Damn it.

Eldridge, why aren't you
with your dad?!

'Cause he's
a giant douche!

Don't talk
about your father that way!

He's actually
a colossal douche.

Um, uh, should I go?

No, no, it's fine.

(moans)

Do we have anything
to eat?!

Order a pizza!

I've got company!

Is it Dave?!

No!
Jimmy?

No!

He's just trying
to push my buttons.

Yeah, Jake's exactly
the same way,

always trying
to get my goat.

Now, who are Dave and Jimmy?

Shh, shh, shh.

ELDRIDGE:
Please don't tell me

you're doing
Jake's loser dad!

I'm a divorced mother
with a 16-year-old son!

I can't be picky!

Now, shut
your pie hole!

I hate you!
I hate you right back!

(door slams)

So... where were we?

Um... are you sure
you don't want

to spend some time
with your son?

I just did.

Fair enough.

Can you tell
I got my boobs done?

Oh, no. They, uh,
they feel very natural.

Oh, good.

That kid absolutely
ruined the first set.

Same thing happened
to my ex-wife.

By the time Jake got
through with them,

they looked like a couple of
windsocks on a quiet day.
Yeah.

Oh, just, uh, just FYI,

I'm all original equipment.
Ah.

Aside from, you know,
a little anal bleaching.

What?

Oh, it was an accident.

I, uh, sat on a Clorox
bottle by mistake.

Story for another day.

(music blasts from radio)

Eldridge, turn down
the freakin' music!

Yeah, well, I don't
want to hear you have sex!

Then put on
your headphones!

That's why I bought
them for you!

(music stops)

That's better.

Come here.

Is something wrong?

Oh, no, no.
Everything's great.

Are you sure, 'cause...

your toenail's the only
thing poking me right now.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm a little distracted.

Well, let me
undistract you.

âª Woke up,
it was a Chelsea morning âª

âª And the first thing
that I heard âª

âª Was a song outside my window âª

âª And the traffic
wrote the words... âª

Oh, give it a rest.

I miss Chelsea.

Hey. I miss the '80s,

but you don't see me
snorting blow off a DeLorean.

I know he's grounded, Judith,

but why can't he be
grounded at your house?

Well, I have a life, too.

Yes, I do.

Since now.

Okay, I'll tell you e truth.

I... I've got
a new girlfriend

and she only gets off
one night a week a...

Why is that funny?

Oh! Ha, ha.

That's the pot calling
the kettle non-orgasmic,

don't you think?

Hello?

Hello? (groans)

Well, have a nice day,
you miserable bitch!

Oh, oh, you're still here!

Uh, uh, have a good weekend.

You know, Zippy, you
remind me of a blind
cat I used to have.

Bumping into walls,

stepping into his
water dish.

He was a hoot.

called him "Magoo."

Cute.

No, he was ugly, too.

Oh, hey, Charlie, uh,
you gonna be home tonight?

Why?

No.
Come on.

I've got a romantic nigh
planned, but I need somebody

to keep an eyen Jake
'cause he's grounded.

I got a better idea.

Open the front door
and leave a trail of hamburgers

to the Army recruiting office.

Everybody wins but America.

Hey, uh, Berta,
would you do me a favor?

Oh, Magoo, always
walking into walls.

âª Men. âª

(rapping on wiow)

(screams)

(rappiWhere are you going?

I told you. I've got a date.

And I told you I'm not going
to be responsible for your kid.

Oh, you don't have to be
responsible for him,

just let him see you.

You know, the illusion
of adult supervision.

No, nono.
I've got plans of my own.

So if you're going to go,
take your kid with you.

Please, Charlie, I booked
a beautiful hotel room.

And I put it on a credit card,
so there's no refund.

What do you mean
"a credit card"?

I'll pay you back, I swear.

Come on, it's just
for one night!

I don't ask for much.

Don't ask for much?
You're a human tip jar

I'm begging you.

I already tookhe Cialis.

Please don't make me
stay he with a boner.

You were going to make me
stay home with a boner!

Okay, okay, think about this.

If it works out
with me and Lyndsey,

I mit be able to move
out of your house and into hers.

Don't do that, Alan.

Don't toy with my heart.

Alright, all right,
tell you what.

Go tell Ja to pack a bag.

I'll drop him off at his mom's.

Now, you're making sense.

(tires screeching)

Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

This isn't over!

Sorry!

All right, here's the deal.

I've got someone  ming ,

so I need you
to make yourself scarce.

Are you back with Chelsea?

No, I'm not back with Chelsea.

So what's this new girl's name?

I don't know--
Jasmine, Jade.

I asked for Asian.

Who'd u ask?

Nobody.

Just get out of here
for e night.

But I'm grounded.
Hey,ey!

Hey, hey, hey.

I don't burden you
with my problems.

Hey, Eldridge.
My uncle's horny.

I'll meeyou at the pier.

âª Men. âª

This is fun, huh?

Sneaking off
to a hotel room

like a couple
of horny teenagers.
Mm-hmm.

Of course, I never
had engh money

like a couple
of as a teenager to
Mm-hmm.     afford a hotel room.

My first time was on
a miniature golf course.

Inside the windmill.

No kidding.
Did you get a hole in one?

Uh, well actually a hole in two.

I lost the first one taking
the putter out of the bag.

aughing)

So, uh, where was
your first time?

Backstage
at aolice concert.

Oh, Sting?

Little bit.

(laughing)

Can we stop at the drug store?

Oh, uh, don't worry.

I brought enough condoms
to gf our brains out.

No, actually, I have
to get some tampons.

Oh. Oh, you mean
for just in case, right?

'Fraid not. Sorry.

Oh, no, no.
Don't, don't be silly.

Um, this is more about us

spding quality time together
than anything else.

I'm glad you feel that way.

Nevertheless,
I do have a plan "B."

Plan "B," Alan.

Itoes with my plan "J."

Oh...

Yay!

ANNOUNCER (on TV):
The conference said it has been
informed by the NCAA...

WOMAN:
So, Charlie,

how can I make you happy?

What are my choices?

Well, you paid for

the full girlfriend
experience, so...

anything you want.

Anything I want.
Mm-hmm.

I like that.

Okay...

Read this magazine...

.while I watch
SportsCenter.

I want the girlfriend experience

and that's what
my girlfriend used to do.

Okay.

And every once
in a while,

look at me and sigh
whe rolling your eyes.

(sighs)

Oh, baby, that's
what Daddy likes.

(Lyndsey moaning)

Cramps, huh?

LYNDSEY:
, I'm having
another child.

(laughs)

Uh, you know,
not that I'm complaining,

but don't you gals
usually circle

this time of the month
on the old calendar?

It's not
an exact science, Alan.

Aw, for God's sake.

It's like the horse head scene
in The Godfather.

Could be worse.

Could be the prom scene
from Carrie.

That's not funny.

Sorry. Tell you what.

I will, uh, call
for some room service.

Any special requests?
Maybe some champagne?

Sure, whatever.

Oh, your wish is my command.

(louder):
Uh, hello. Hi.

Yeah, this is
Dr. Alan Harper.

I'in room 710,

and I would like a bottle
of your best champagne

Oh, really?

You don't have anything
more expensive?

Alright, it'll have to do.

Also, I would like some
fresh strawberries

and a dozen blue point oysters.

Well, find some.

This is a special evening
and I will spare no expense.

Thank you.

LYNDSEY:
Hey, Alan?

Yes, my sweet?

Can u hand me
my purse?

Oh, su.

Ow!

Soy.

We're in luck.

We are?

I've still got a couple
of Vicodin I stole from myon.

You stole drugfrom your son?

I's only fair.
He stole my youth.

All righty.

Room service.

Oh, that was quick.

Men. âª

(TV chatter)

All right, now, we've
circled back around

to hockey scores, so...
(TV turns off)

time for sex.

Okay.

And what kind of sex
does Charlie want?

Ooh...

And what kind of sex
does Charlie wanHard to pick.

It's kind of like
Baskin-Robbins.

You know, if they
charged $1,000 a scoop.

And sprinkles
are way extra.

Well i guess if i have to choose

my favorite kind of
sex is make-up sex.

You're kidding.

No, it's great.

Here's how we do it.

I will do or say sething
that will really irritate you.

I can imagine
that happening.

And then we'll have
an argument,

which will escalate
into a fight.

You'll sulk, I'll pout.

Then after a couple
of minutes, we'll look
at each other

and realize we're being
silly, and how lucky we
are to have each other.

Then I will take
you in my arms

and we'll hump
our brains out.

Fine. How do we start?

Let me think.

All right.

Go in the bathroom
and look in the sink.

What?

Just-just do it.
Trust me.

Oh, God,
it's disgusting!

Good, go with that.

Would it kill you to rinse out
the sink after you shave?

Sorry.

All right, I forgive you.

No, no-no, no,
no, no, no. Not yet.

Make me work for it.

Okay.

Damn it, Charlie,

you're the most thoughtless man
in the wld.

Oh, come on, I'll rinse out
the sink when I brush my teeth.

You haven't brushed
your teeth yet?

What kind of a pig are you?

Nice touch.

But just remember, you're not
really mad about the whiskers.

You're mad, 'cause
I don't listen to you

and I don't like your friends

and I said snide things
about your mother.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so...

when do we get to the "humping
our brains out"?

Oh, we're not even close.

This goes on for hours.

Take this and pretend
like you're working.

Oh, sweetie,
I don't have to pretend.

How would you feel
about slapping some

greasy skin cream
all over your face?

Where you going with this?

I'm just talking skin cream.

What do you think,
I'm some kind of freak?

Okay, but I'm not
that kind of freak.

âª Men. âª

(music from TV)

(belches)

Whoa, that's going
to attract seagulls.

Okay, let's get this over with.

Don't you want to have some room
service champagne and oysters?

No. I do this better
on an empty stomach.

(TV turns off)

By the way, um,
I'm a little foggy
from the Vicodin,

so if I fall asleep
in the middle,

just give me a little
tap on the shoulder.

Okay.

Come here.

You're a good
kisser, Alan.

Thank you.

Better than my ex-husband.

Oh. Well, good for me.

He made up for it

below the waist,
if you know what I mean.

He had big feet?

Three of them.

But only two wore shoes.

Lucky you.

Ah, don't worry.

Size doesn't matter to me.

Good to know.

In fact,
in this situation,

the smaller the better.

Um... you're welcome?

(gurgling)

What the hell was that?

Um, I don't know.

Maybe the strawberries are
fighting with the oysters.

(gurgling)
Uh-oh.

What?

I think the oysters
are making a break for it.

Excuse me.

Are you going to throw up?

I wish!

You might want
to turn the TV on-- loud!

Why?

You don't want to hear
what's about to happen!

âª Oh... klahoma âª

âª Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plain âª

âª Where the waving wheat âª

âª It sure smells sweet
when the wind... âª

âª Men. âª

All right,
one grilled cheese

with avocado and bacon,
extra crispy.

Oh, thank you, honey.

You realize that bacon's
going to kill you.

I know.

You say you know,
but you keep eating it.

Oh, come on, don't nag.

I'm not nagging,
I'm concerned about you.

Fine, fine.
I'll take the bacon off.

Don't do me any favors.

No-no, no. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it, see?

(door opens and closes)

Who's that?

Just the kid.
Jake, get in here!

We have a kid?

You didn't say anything
about having a kid.

He's not ours.
He's my brother's.

So what's my part
in this scenario?

You don't think I'm a good role
model, and yet, paradoxically,

you still want
to have children with me.

What?

Did you go out even
though you were grounded?

You told me to.

Don't look at me
like that. He's lying.

I'm not lying.

And I'm not looking at you.

All right, all right, enough.

You, young man,

go to your room and think
about what you've done.

Whatever.

I think we handled
that really well.

Tough love, but I'm
still the cool uncle.

Hey, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

I'm very happy.

In fact, are you free tomorrow?

I'm never free,
but I'm available.

Well, great.

How about you drag me
to some boring museum

so I can miss the Laker game?

It's your money.

Is it okay if I go
take a shower?

Well, sure.
Okay.

I'll be up in a bit.

(sighs)

Still cheaper
than getting married.

âª Men. âª

All righty.
Here we are.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Believe it or not,
I actually had a good time.

Nice hotel,
room service, no teenagers.

Um, I'm glad.

So, shall we try it again

in, you know,
five or six days?

I would like that.

Okay, uh...

I don't mean to rush
you, but I really

have to go home
to my bathroom.

Want to use mine?

Uh, no. No, that wouldn't

be good for our
relationship.

All right.

Well, bye.

Seriously, get out of the car.

âª Oh... klahoma

WOMAN (on TV):
Bill, did you notice that girl

in the bikini
coming down the slope?

MAN (on TV):
I did...

You might want
to eat something

so that when
you throw up later,

it won't just be alcohol
and stomach juice.

Way ahead of you.

I call it an Egg McBourbon.

So this is your life now?

You just sit here
miserable and alone,

waiting for Chelsea to call?

I'm not waiting for her to call.

I'm watching TV.
Hmm.

And occasionally, I cry.

You do realize you're watching
the Weather Channel?

WOMAN (on TV):
All the way to the South East...

(dramatic instrumental music
plays on TV)

Happy?

Oh, yeah, The Pet Channel.

Who doesn't enjoy seeing a dog
get his anal glands expressed?

(phone ringing)

Chelsea?

(sighs)

Your ex-wife.

Oh.

Speaking of having
one's anal glands expressed.

Hi, Judith.
What's up?

Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

That's terrible.

Oh. Her grandfather died.

He was 94. It's no big deal.

(clears throat)

Well, he's in
a better place now.

He has to be.

He lived in Sacramento.

I'm sorry.
What's that?

You're kidding.

Oh. Oh, I-I...

I always loved that clock.

He left me
his grandfather clock.

Very old, worth a fortune.

I can sell it and buy a new car.

Oh, Judith,
that's just tragic.

So, uh, when are they going
to deliver the clock?

Oh. Yeah, yeah.

I guess your grandmother does
have more important things

to box up now...

like your grandfather.

You're right, not funny.

She never got my sense of humor.

Uh, well, I guess
I'll just drive up

to Sacramento
and pick it up.

Uh, once again,
my deepest sympathies.

Okay.

Score!

Help me out here.

Why would dith's grandfather
leave you a valuable antique?

He liked me.
I was the only one in the family

who would sit
for hours listening

to his stupid stories
about Korea.

He fought in Korea?

No, he was a sex tourist.

Very creepy.

You know, I always
admired that clock.

I remember the first time
I saw it, I said,

"Bill, that is a hell of a clock
you got there."

Uh, and he was hard of hearing,

so that led
to the Korea stories.

Oh, hey,

you want to drive up
and get it with me?

Let's see.

Do I want to drive six hours
to Sacramento

to pick up a dead guy's clock?

With me.

Don't take this
the wrong way,

but I would rather get
a maple syrup enema

and then sit
on an anthill.

You didn't just make that up.

No. No, I've actually compiled
a list of things I'd rather do

than spend long periods of time
with you in an enclosed space.

Want to hear
some more?

No, thank you.

You sure? 'Cause I got a beauty

that involves hemorrhoids,
a bottle brush and sea salt.

I get it.

I'll just take Jake.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

So both you and Jake
are gonna be gone?
Yes.

Score!

âª Men. âª

MAN (on TV):
Here's ordinary cat litter

after five days
of continuous use

by a relatively healthy cat.

Yuck! Looks bad, smells worse.

Now, here's Magic Pussy Litter

with its patented
Cluster Busters...

That is really cool.

Hey.

Hey.

What you watching?

An amazing breakthrough
in cat crap technology.

Dad says you're vegging
in front of the

Well, he's right for a change.

You know, I kind of do, too.

Remember how she would
come down in the morning,

and lean over
to pour cereal for breakfast,

and you could see
right down her robe?

Too soon?

What are you
doing up so late?

I was hungry.

Want to join me
for a grilled cheese sandwich?

Nah.
Pigs in a blanket?

I'm all right.

Two ice cream sandwiches
on a waffle?

I'll pass.

It's no trouble,

I'm making 'em anyway.

I'm fine.

You know, I really am sorry

Well, thanks, buddy.

Her boobs are real, right?

Yup.

Relax, take in

Okay, now what?

We're two men on the open road,

We can do whatever we want.

Okay.

I want to drive.

Later. Pick something else.

Yeah.

Oh!

Oh, well, very funny.

Uh, so you want to go toot

Wow.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

That is a bran muffin and a half

Yeah, well,
this is grilled cheese sandwich,

pigs in a blanket

Aw, hell,

Hey, Russell.

Oh, hey, Charlie.

You wa a muscle relaxer?

You take one with a Viagra,

and you're essentially Gumby
with a Pokey.

(laughs)

No, thanks.

I actually have a prescription
from a doctor.

Whoa. Look at you

following the letter
and spirit of the law.

Sleeping pills.

Those can be fun.

You know, with a couple
Red Bulls

so you don't fall asleep.

Party is over, Russell.

I need to get some sleep.

Oh. Well, then
you don't want this.

Nope.

You want something organic,

something created
by Mother Nature.

What do you
got in mind?
Ganja.

You trying to sell me pot?

Ah, not just pot.

I call this Ojai So-high.

Two hits, and a couple
of chicken burritos,

and it's "Goodnight, Irene."

Don't you need a
prescription for that?

What are you, a cop?

Okay, okay, but you're just
driving the price up.

Hello.

Oh, Dr. Gollygupta.

Russell here.

Oh, hello, Russell.

How are they hanging?

Twice the length of my penis,
thanks for asking.

My friend here needs
a prescription.

All right, uh, let me see him.

Oh, okay.

Charlie, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Gollygupta

of the Gollygupta Hypertension
and Glaucoma Clinic

in Sri Lanka.

Please to turn your head
and cough.

Just turn your head...
Yeah. (coughs)

(coughs)
There you go.

Oh, that's no good.

I'll send you a prescription.

(phone ringing)

Excuse me.

Hello, DirecTV customer service.

Roger speaking.

(printer beeps)

Oh, here it is.

Ah. Great news, Charlie.

You've got glaucoma!

âª Men. âª

You know,
for gas station sweatpants,

these aren't bad.

I beg to differ.

May I say that you have become
a very good driver?

Grand Theft Auto, Dad.

It'd like driver's ed,
but with pimps and hos.

Well, whatever.

So, uh, have you given
any more thought

to what you want to do
after high school?

If this is the
college talk,

I think we need to
both be realistic.

Hey, hey, I know

a big university is probably out
of reach for the time being,

but there's still
junior colleges,

community colleges,
trade schools.

Hmm, man, I'd like
to trade schools right now

'cause this one's
kicking my ass.

Come on, Jake.

You know what
I'm talking about.

You have to start making plans.

Did you have plans
when you were my age?

Yeah, I had big plans.

What happened to 'em?

Just drive.

My life isn't over, you know.

Okay.

What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

Well, then, you must be
like The Hulk.

Let me tell you something,
young man.

Chapter two of your father's
story has yet to be written.

Is chapter one
"I Crapped My Pants"?

âª Men. âª

Is that what
I think it is?

Yeah. I got a prescription.

God, I love California.

Just walk into a store
and buy your weed.

No more schlepping out to Reseda

and trading a piece of tail

for a short bag of stems
and seeds.

You're welcome to join me here.

No, no, not while I'm working.

All right.

Okay, I'm done working.

Man...

if I'd known
you liked the wacky weed,

I wouldn't have spent
the last eight years

getting baked under the deck.

You know, when I was on break.

Actually, this is the first time
I've touched the stuff

since a ZZ Top concert in '92.

I got so paranoid, I locked
myself in a Porta Potti

and tried to tunnel home.

(laughs)

Well, good news.

Pot's a lot stronger now.

What do you think?

I've rolled better joints
on the back of a motorcycle

while digging a bullet out
of my boyfriend's shoulder.

All right, fine.

You try it.

Oh, man, I hope
this helps me sleep.

I can't take another night,

wandering around the house,
thinking about Chelsea.

Yeah, yeah, boo-hoo.

Let's fire up this bad boy.

âª Men. âª

This is stupid.

We should've just left it
in the car.

Well, it's very
valuable, Jake.

I don't want
to see it stolen.

Who steals clocks?

Clocktomaniacs.

You have your mother's
sense of humor.

Okay, let's put her
down real easy.

Okay.

O-kay.

Good.

So, it looks like we have
a couple of hours

of daylight left.

How about you and I get
to know our state capital?

You want to drive
to San Francisco?

No, Sacramento is the capital
of California.

I don't think so.

Trust me.

Come on, got a map
from the lobby

that shows all the places
of interest in Old Sac.

(chuckles) Old sac. Get it?

Oh, yeah.

That was much better
than my joke.

JAKE:
Look at us, a couple of nuts

hanging out in Sacramento.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

(both laughing)

Do it again.

Do it again.
No, no.
Oh, come on, please.

Do it again.
Do it again.

All right, all right.
Last time.
All right.

(Ã  la federale):
Badges?

We don't need
no stinkin' badges!

Okay, okay, I got one.

I got one.

(Ã  la Karl from Sling Blade)
Mm.

Some folks call it
a sling blade.

I call it a kaiser blade.

Mm.
(laughing)

I like them French fried taters.

Mmm.

Oh, good idea.

Where you going?

To the pier to get some of them
French fried taters.

No. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

What?

I love you, Berta.

I love you, too, Charlie.

Give me a thousand dollars.

Why?

Well, if you have to ask,
you don't really love me.

Oh, oh, and-and pretzels!

Get some pretzels!
Pretzels?

We don't need
no stinkin' pretzels!

(chuckles)

Oh, man, I'm so lucky
to have her in my life.

You've had a lot of wonderful
women in your life.

But you always find a way to
sabotage the relationship.

Chelsea?

MIA:
She's right, Charlie.

If there's a way it can
be blown, you'll blow it.

And not in the fun way.

Mia?

Tell me something,
Charlie.

Do you think your
inability to commit

and all your
macho posturing

is because deep down,
you're afraid you're gay?

You know,

I've wondered that, too.

Are you just a big ol' 'mo?

LYDIA:
He's not a 'mo.

He's got mommy issues.

Lots and lots of mommy issues.

Lydia!

Hey, it's Lydia.

EVELYN:
Excuse me.

Why does everyone
blame the mother?

Frankly, I think
you were more on target

with that homo theory.

Okay, I don't want
to be high anymore!

âª âª

âª Men. âª

Hey, ask me why they should
change the name

of the Sacramento Kings
to the Sacramento Nads?

Why?

That way, everyone can chant,
"Go Nads!

Go Nads!"

Another winner.

Yeah, I may not be good
at school or sports,

but no one beats me
at ball jokes.

I'm so proud.

Can we watch TV?

You can watch TV anytime.

Let's talk.

You sure?

That hardly ever goes well.

Come on, what's going on
in your life?

Nothing.

Oh, please, you're 16.

That-that's a very
tumultuous time.

I mean, especially
with all the sexual issues

and the drugs and the internet.

Yeah. You gonna eat
your chicken skin?

Help yourself.

You ask me,
the skin's the best part.

Yeah, but it's not good for you.

Anyway, about your life...

Hey, there's a business
opportunity.

Go to all thosskinless chicken
restaurants,

and take the skin
that they throw away

and open up a restaurant next
door named "El Pollo Skin-o."

That means "the chicken skin"
in Spanish.

That's very clever.

And guess where we'll open up
our first restaurant?

Sacramento.

Charming.

Then Muncie, Indiana, home
of Ball State University.

Then Lake Titicaca.

Not a ball joke,
but still funny.

Excuse me.

(muffled screaming)

What are you doing?

Screaming into a towel.

Oh.

I'm gonna watch TV.

Okay.

âª âª

(muffled screaming)

âª Men. âª

Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

How many times has that

been said in this bed?

Or in this chair?

Or all over this rug?

On the balcony

looking at the ocean?

(speaking Polish)

You're not here!

You're not here!
None of you are here!

Wow, so this is
the bedroom.

I never got past
the couch.

What are you
complaining about?

I never got out
of the car.

He did me in a little
church in Van Nuys.

Right in the pew.

I would never let him
do me in the pew.

He dumped me when I said,
"I love you."

He dumped me

when he saw my penis.

Me, too.

And he never called me again.

Why, Charlie?

Why didn't you call?

(women clamoring)

I was busy.

I lost your number!

I was out of town!

You had a penis!

You, I don't know
what that thing was!

(panting)

âª âª

This isn't happening.

This isn't happening.

Hey, Charlie.
(gasps)

Oh, Rose, not you, too.

Why not me, too?

Look, I'm really sorry
about our one-night stand.

I know I should've called you.

Yes, you should have.

Tell you what.

After I come down
off this stupid pot,

How about I'll call the real you

and take you out
on a proper date,

tell you how much
you mean to me--

how much you've
always meant to me?

The real me would like that
very much.

All I could find was
donuts and chalupas.

Hey, Rose!

Wait, you can see her?

Yeah, why?

(whispering): Can't you?

What the hell's going on?

You're imagining Berta.

Are you really here?

I don't know, am I?

Call me.

Okay, roll another fatty,

and let's polish off
these donuts.

âª Men. âª

Why can't I drive?

Because we are carrying
a very fragile clock

that is worth
a lot of money.
(sighs)

So when you sell it, what are
you gonna do with the cash?

Uh, I'm not sure.

I might buy a new car.

I might pay your Uncle Charlie
some of what I owe him.

Uh, I might put it
in your college fund.

So what kind of car
are you going to get?

I got my eye on a
Lexus convertible.

Sweet.
You know what?

That means you can
have this one.

No, thanks.

I want to get one
of those new Camaros.

Red with yellow
racing stripes.

And then I'm gonna
get a big, flaming skull

painted on the hood.

Don't you think
you ought to wait

to see how the people
at Domino's feel about that?

Really?

You think
I can get a job at Domino's?

Hey, a man's reach
should exceed his grasp

or what's a heaven for?

I have no idea
what you're talking about.

It means that as a
human, we should--

Oh, no!

No, no, no,
no, no, no!

I was afraid I had
another case of swamp ass.

Another case?

Yeah, it happens every year

Only thing that helps it

I see.

Half a tube of each,

It's like squirting ketchup

Hey. Where have
you guys been?

Van Nuys.

What were you doing in Van Nuys?

That's where the jail is.

What?

I got arrested.

You're kidding. What for?

Apparently, I ran a red
light at 64 miles an hour.

And I was in
the passenger seat.

Yes, I was driving,

therefore you were in
the passenger seat.

Anyway, it turns out

I had a couple of
unpaid parking tickets.

Seventeen.

Thank you.

They arrested you
for unpaid parking tickets?

Well, there was also
a bench warrant

when I didn't show up in court.

Well, how could you not
show up in court?

Don't they send
you a summons?

Lots of them,
but I threw them away.

I thought they were
for jury duty.

Long story short,
when I didn't show up,

they suspended my license.

And I was in the passenger seat.

So you were driving
with a suspended license?

Only for a couple of years.

Luckily though,
my license was fine,

so when they took him
to the police station,

I followed in the Mercedes.

By the way,

I reset all your radio stations
to good stuff.

I'd like to be alone now, Jake.

Understandable.

You've been through a lot.

By the way, if you need anyone
to drive you to the movies

or the mall or a strip club,
I'm available.

Appreciate it.

And you can just relax
in the passenger seat,

like I did earlier today.

Get out!

Listen, I am sorry
that you lost your license,

but I would be remiss
if I did not point out

what a bad example
you're setting for Jake.

Not now, Alan.

Oh, no, I think now
is exactly the right time.

That young man looks up to you.

And when he sees you blatantly
disregard the rules of the road,

he's more likely
to do it himself.

You're right. You're right.

I'm sorry.

Are you really?

Or you just saying the words?

Uh, don't walk away

I'm gonna count

come up with
some kind of safe word.

Like "pumpernickel."

Sure, whatever.

You know, until you get
your license back,

you can count on me to drive you
wherever you need to go.

Thanks.

Of course, during the week,
I'm working.

I know.

And, uh, and Monday nights,
I'm at the senior center.

What the hell are you doing
at the senior center?

Free pilates class.

(scoffs)

They don't even check IDs.

Uh, Tuesdays
and Thursday nights,

they have water aerobics, uh,
Wednesday is low-impact hip-hop,

and, uh, Friday
is movie night.

This week is Cocoon.

Again.

And of course on Saturday,
you know, I need to power down,

and, uh, Saturday night...

(knocks on table)

maybe a date.

(chuckles)

You're calling those
magazines dates now?

(laughs)

(makes whoosh, pop noises)

(laughs)

But, hey, any other time

you need a ride,
I'm your man.

Wonderful.

Sunday is usually good.

Uh-huh.

Not this Sunday though;
I got a little thing.

I know, but what does that
have to do with Sunday?

(chuckles)

Cute, cute.

Um, you know, actually,

I've been meaning
to talk to you about this,

but, um, I was waiting
for the right time.

Are you...

(knocks on table)

moving out?

(laughs)

No. But that never
ceases to be amusing.

Um, anyhoo, turns out,

I was invited to
Chelsea's birthday party.

What?

Yeah, well, you know,
when she was living here,

we were friends,
and we've remained friends.

She invited you to
her birthday party?

I won't go
if you don't want me to.

I don't want you to.

Okay.

Asked and answered.

Done and done.

I did buy her a lovely scarf.

Will it support your
weight from a shower rod?

(laughs)

Classic.

(laughs)

Of course, it might be a little
awkward if I don't show.

Why is that?

I volunteered to bring the ice.

Is that why you've been
filling Ziploc bags

with my ice
cubes all week?

It's exactly the same ice
as the kind you have to pay for,

sans the fancy
polar bear label.

I'm not gonna say
this again, Alan.

I do not want you hanging
out with my ex-fiancÃ©e.

I hear you,
loud and clear.

It's just so rare
I get to socialize

with people my own age.

What, there's no free nooky
night at the senior center?

(forced chuckle)

(makes whoosh, bang noises)

(laughs)

Okay, okay, what if I just go
for cocktails and skip dinner?

Three?
Three.

âª Men. âª

Alan, wake up.

Pumpernickel!

You got to go
to Chelsea's party.

Uh, okay.

If you don't go, she's gonna
know I told you not to.

That's possible.

It's a sure thing.

She knows you never
pass up a free meal.

That's not true.

How many birthdays have you had
at Denny's this year?

All right.

So you got to go to the party

and let her know that I'm doing
just fine without her.

Okay.

But you got to be cool about it.

You know, like in passing.

Sure, sure. Uh, how's this?

Uh, hey, Chelsea,
happy birthday.

Charlie's doing fine without you

and never wanders around the
house in the middle of the night

with a drink in his hand.

Alan.

Yeah?
You need teeth

to say "pumpernickel."

Got it.

âª Men. âª

Oh.

Alan, hi.

I hope I'm not
here early.

The, uh, the
invite said 8:00.

And, uh, 8:00 it is.

Come on in.

Who is this?

That's how you
greet a guest?

"Who is this?"

Okay. Who are you
and what the hell

you doing here
so freaking early?

This is Alan,
Charlie's brother.

Oh.

Alan, I'm Ed.

Heard a lot about you.

Oh, heard a lot
about you, too.

You know, uh, you being
in the Navy with Tom and, uh,

you guys keeping in touch, even
though you were both married.

And, uh, now you're reunited.

(chuckles)

Great song.

(chuckles)

âª Reunited and feels so good. âª

So where's the birthday girl?

Taking a shower.

(groans)
Women, huh?

(chuckles):
Always running late.

Bet you don't miss that.

I brought the ice.

Oh!

(sighs)

I guess the bottom got wet.
You know how that is.

I mean, because, you know,
it happens to everybody,

not because you're gay.

(quietly): And I thought
you were exaggerating.

(chucks)

And remember, looky, no touchy.

âª Men. âª

What's that?

A birthday present for Chelsea.

But you guys broke up.

Yeah, well, I bought it
a couple of months ago.

Why?
'Cause I thought

that's when her birthday was.

Turns out, I confused it
with St. Patrick's Day.

Are those real diamonds?

Yep.

Burn.

What?

You could've saved a lot of
money with Cuban zirconium.

Cuban zirconium?

Yeah.

'cause it's just
as sparkly as a diamond,

and it's cheap
'cause it's from Cuba.

Good Lord, you're an idiot.

Hey, I'm not the one
who wasted a bunch of money

on a bralet for a girl
who dumped me.

It's not a waste.

I'm still going to give it
to her.

In fact...

comen, you're driving
me to Chelsea's.

Did it occur to you
that I might have plans?

Oh, I'm sorry.

Do you have plans?

No, but there's
a principle involved.

I'm just saying,
there's a right way,

and there's a wrong way.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

You need any condoms?

No. Do you?

No. I got a buttload.

A buttload, huh?

You may need to read
the instructions more carefully.

I don't get it.

W-Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Have you used
any of them yet?

Yeah, sure.

For sex?

Oh. Um, no.

For water balloons.

Well, keep a few
in reserve,

'cause you're not
really breeding stock.

So, what are you
looking for?

Birthday card for Chelsea.

Oh. Good idea.

(chuckles)
Look at this one.

Says, "I got you
a birthday package."

And on the inside,
it's a naked fat guy

with a hole for you
to pop your finger through.

Mm, no.

Are you sure?

He really likes you.

Here we go.

"Wishing you all the
dreams of your heart,

"all the love
in the world

"and the beautiful
day you deserve

for being so special."

That's not funny.

Not supposed to be funny.

Yeah, well,
mission accomplished.

(snorts)

(chuckles)
Look at this one.

It's an old lady
with long banana boobs

and a dog looking at her.

And on the inside, isays,
"How many were in your litter?"

That's not a
birthday card.

It could be.
Write "happy birthday" inside.

I need a real
birthday card.

Okay.

Here's one
with a puppy on it.

"For someone very special
on her birthday.

Each day is a beautiful
gift to enjoy."

That's pretty good.

Yeah, and then you
could cut a hole

and pop your pinky through
and give that dog a bone.

I can't help you if you're not
going to work with me.

I'm really glad
you came, Alan.

How could I not?

We're friends.

I know, but I was afraid it
might be uncomfortable for you.

No, no. Don't be silly.

So, uh, that's it?

No dinner? Just finger foods?

Sorry.

Oh, no, it's fine.

I could never have enough
prosciutto and melon.

Oh. Hey, that'd be a good
name for a singing act.

Prosciutto and Melon.

"Ladies and gentlemen,

the song stylings of
Prosciutto and Melon."

There's an open mic night
at the senior center.

I'm going to use that.

Terrific.

So, how's he doing?

Who?
Alan.

Oh, oh, Charlie.

Uh, uh, he's doing fine--
just fine.

Good, good.

In fact, he told me to
tell you happy birthday.

Oh, that's nice.
Tell him I said thanks.

I will.

And I'm sure he'd say,
"You're welcome."

So, um, how are
you doing?

And it's me asking,
not Charlie.

Although I'm sure he'd
be interested.

Not that I'd tell him,
unless you want me to.

Do you want me to? Wait.

Tell me how you're doing first,
and then we can decide.

I'm doing fine, Alan.

Good, good. Oh, so is Charlie.

Can we change the subject?

You're the one
who brought it up, but sure.

You ever think about your
dad and Ed having sex?

"Happy birthday,
thinking of you."

(scoffs softly)

What's wrong with it?

It's, what to you call it,
redumbnent.

Redumbnent?

Yeah. You got her a present
and you got her a birthday card.

You're obviously
thinking of her.

So saying you're thinking
of her is redumbnent.

So if you act like a moron,

saying you're a moron
would be redumbnent.

Now you're getting it.

Oh, buddy, you really
shouldn't be walking around

without a helmet.

Wait here.
I'll be right back.

Why can't I
go with you?

Because I'm just
gonna give Chelsea
the bracelet and leave.

Bring me back
a piece of cake.

Corner with a flower
would be nice.

(door opens)

What the hell
are you doing?

Um...

checking for leaks?

Listen...

I need you to go up there
and give Chelsea the present.

Why? Did you wuss out?

No, no, I just don't
want to make a scene.

Here, wuss, wuss,
wuss, wuss.

Wuss, wuss, wuss...

(weakly):
wuss... wuss...

Just take the bracelet,
ring the doorbell,

say, "Happy birthday,
this is from Uncle Charlie,"

and leave.

Can I get a piece of cake?

Fine, grab a piece of cake.

What if they haven't
cut the cake yet?
Can I hang out?

No. I'm not gonna
sit here waiting for you.

Well, you don't
really have choice.

You're not
allowed to drive.

What are you saying?

Well, at the risk
of being redumbnent,

I'm saying I'll
be having cake.

I can't believe I'm being
blackmailed by Forrest Gump.

Can I tell her you're
waiting out here?

No! Are you nuts?

I was just thinking it'd
be a good way to get a
second piece of cake.

Get out of here!

(sigh)
Run, Forrest, run.

What if I meet a
cute girl up there?

Would you mind
walking home?

Jake, I swear to God,

do not make me
get out of this car.

Excuse me, let's not
forget who's doing
who a favor here.

Go.

Yes, sir.

Extra large?

Yeah, maybe if he
wears it as a lucky hat.

So, what about
the blonde?

Is she single?

Yeah, but she's
a little crazy.

Mm, not a deal breaker.

The well-adjusted ones
generally won't come near me.

Hey, Dad.

What are you doing here?

Uncle Charlie wanted me to give
Chelsea this birthday present.

Here.

So, have you cut the cake yet?

Uh, no.

We haven't even sung
"Happy Birthday" yet.

Oh.

âª Happy birthday âª

(others joining in):
âª To you âª

âª Happy birthday âª

âª To you âª

âª Happy birthday âª

âª Dear Chelsea âª

âª Happy birthday âª

âª To you. âª

WOMAN:
Yay!

Thank you.

Thank you for coming.

Excuse me,
I need to get some air.

Wasn't me-- I always
claim 'em, you know that.

Come on, Skipper.

So, where's the cake?

(clicks on radio)

(changes station)

(changes station)

Aw, geez!

(flask clatters)

(engine starts)

(crashing)

Oh, this is not gonna end well.

Charlie?

Hey, Chels.

Happy birthday!

âª Men... âª

âª Men... âª

Hey, did I tell you Uncle
Charlie's gonna pay me

to drive him back
and forth to work?

Oh, that's nice.

CHARLIE (calls):
I'm ready!

Yeah, I get to drive
his car twice a day

for three to six months,
depending on good behavior.

CHARLIE:
Move it, numbnuts!

Smart money's on six.

.......... ********** ..........

What the hell is that?

Oh, sorry. I set my alarm so I could
go home before Jake wakes up.

Turn it off.

I'm trying, but my arm's asleep.

Ugh. There. Whoo.

I can't believe you have a watch alarm.

Yeah, it's a Timex.
Well, a really nice knock-off.

Even has Indiglo. See?

Oh. Oh, for God's sake, it's 6 a.m.

Oh, I know, sorry. We agreed we don't
want our kids to know about us.

Yeah, yeah, goodbye.

Bye.

Guess a little morning quickie
is out of the question.

If you can do it without waking me up.

You're not really thinking about it,
are you?

Dear Lord. Charlie?

Huh?

- You okay?
- Sure.

Why do you ask?

Because you're passed out
on the stairs.

Really?

Oh, that's not good.

How much did you have
to drink last night?

Let's see.

I don't know.

I wonder how I got my pants off
over my shoes.

Maybe you took your shoes off
and then put them back on.

Think it through, Alan.

For what possible activity would I need
my pants off and my shoes on?

I don't know.
Chasing a reluctant hooker?

Can't rule it out.

So where have you been?

I was with Lyndsey.

Who's Lyndsey?

Eldridge's mom.

- Who's Eldridge?
- Jake's friend.

Jake is my son.

I know who Jake is.

What I don't know
is where my pants are.

Excuse me.

Guess who had a Cobb salad
for dinner.

Charming. I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go lay down.

You know, Jake may not be
the brightest monkey in the meadow...

but even he's gonna figure out
that you're banging his buddy's mom.

- I'll tell him when the time is right.
- And when is that?

When Lyndsey and I have built
a solid relationship that will last.

I don't wanna complicate
his friendship with Eldridge.

- Lyndsey's son, right?
- Right.

Ha!

Yeah, yeah, very good.

The point is,
I haven't said anything to Jake...

because in a lot of ways,
he's a little boy.

He's not very sophisticated
when it comes to adult sexual...

relationships.

Yours?

Alan, she's, like, 16.

And again, I ask...

hoping I won't be called to testify...

yours?
- No, she's coming from Jake's room.

Why would a girl
be leaving Jake's room at 7?

- Why do you think?
- Oh, come on, he's 16.

Not everybody waits
till they're a junior in college, Alan.

Sophomore.
And I still wasn't emotionally ready.

Well, obviously,
your kid's a little more advanced.

No, no. This is unacceptable.

He and I are gonna
have to have a little talk.

Maybe he can give you some tips.

Unbelievable.

My little boy spent the night
with two girls.

Two so far.

- What?
- We don't have a final tally.

There might be more clowns
in that car.

- You think?
- At this point, anything's possible.

- There's only one way to find out.
- Hang on, hang on.

Come here, let's think this through.

What? What is there to think through?

The possibility of my son
hosting an orgy?

Now, not to be a stickler...

but technically, an orgy requires
a minimum of six participants.

- What?
- It goes masturbation, one on one...

threesome, two couples swinging,
two couples with a looky-loo, orgy, six.

It frightens me that you know that.

Everybody knows that.

Whatever you call it,
it needs to be nipped in the bud.

Now we're talking three girls
and a guy named Bud.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

What are you gonna do, punish him?

What do you want to do,
give him a merit badge?

- It is quite an accomplishment.
- This is not funny, Charlie.

I'm not laughing. The kid's doing better
than I am. I woke up on the stairs alone.

Oh, you're up.

These were in the mailbox.

What were they doing in the mailbox?

I don't know,
but there's postage on them.

Well, I clearly had a plan of some kind.

What's everybody doing up so early?

We just saw two girls sneaking out
of Jake's room.

Two?

- Two.
- Taterhead had a threesome?

We don't know that.

Maybe they were having
an all-night study session.

My God, he had a threesome.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Hungry?
- Yep.

- Thirsty?
- Mm-hm.

Proud?

- What?
- Ignore him.

So, what'd you wind up doing
last night?

- Nothing.
- "Nothing," you say.

- So just an evening alone in your room?
- Pretty much.

Quiet, uneventful?

Boring?

I guess.

Nothing I have to clean up?

Nope. Wait, I did have a sandwich in bed.

I knew it.

- What are you talking about?
- We saw the girls, Jake.

Well, this is awkward.

Two hotties sneaking out of your room.
Up top, stud.

Charlie, this does not call for a high five.

You're right. It's hugging time.

- Come here, you dog.
- Stop it. Stop it.

I wanna know
what those girls were doing.

They were making a sandwich.

Would you please?

I am waiting for an answer.

Their names are Tiffany and Joanne.
They're from my school and into surfing.

Terrific. So, what were they
doing in your room?

Hey, chill, I'm getting to it.

- Yeah, chill.
- He's getting to it.

They were gonna sleep in their car
so they could hit the waves...

and I told them they could crash here.
- So nothing happened?

No, we're just friends.
I slept on the floor.

Aww.

This is not "aww." This is "yay."

Yay.

So when I asked you, why did you lie?

It's usually the simpler path.

Why didn't you ask permission
before asking your friends over?

You weren't around.
Where were you, by the way?

I went to the gym.

Yeah, a little, uh, cardio, spinning class,
light weights.

I'm just into maintenance,
not bulking up.

Don't find that attractive.

I prefer the lean, mean swimmer's body,
you know, like...

Jesus.

Nice, Alan, drag our Lord into it.

You still could've called me
or asked your uncle.

You didn't answer your phone, Uncle
Charlie was busy trying to mail his pants.

Good, you saw that. Did I happen
to mention why I was doing it?

- Nope.
- And you didn't ask?

Over the years,
I've learned to look the other way.

All right, let's not get off track here.

If you're gonna have company,
you give one of us a heads up.

- Fine.
- Oh, hey, look...

there's a note in my pocket.

"Dear Inspected By Number 94:"

It is with a heavy heart
that I write to you.

The zipper you signed off on
has snagged my ball sack.

Thank you for your attention
to this matter.

"Sincerely yours,
Charles Francis Harper."

Well, that explains the blood
in my shorts.

I hope.

I've got a little surprise for you.

Well, I've got a...

what I'm told
is a perfectly adequate surprise for you.

You like?

Oh, yes. Ha, ha.

Your surprise has greatly enhanced
my surprise.

Oh, is that whipped cream
or are you planning to shave me?

I mean, you know, I'm fine either way.

- It's whipped cream, Alan.
- Oh, okay.

Uh, fat free?
Because I'm trying to cut down.

Relax, you're not gonna be
the one licking it up.

Oh.

Well, bon appétit.

- Ma!
- Damn.

Eldridge, why aren't you in school?

It's a half day. Teachers' conference.

- How come I didn't know about that?
- I don't know.

Jake's gonna stay for dinner, okay?

Uh... Did he ask his dad?

Yes, Mrs. MacElroy. He said it's fine.

- No, he didn't. He's totally lying.
- Shh!

He's been lying a lot lately.

Boy, you try to bring a kid up
with some values...

Hand me a tissue, will you? The whipped
cream's dripping into my crack.

Want some pie?

Sure. Got any whipped cream?

Usually we do.

I don't see it.

Man, we go through a lot
of whipped cream in this house.

Was that my dad?

Hi.

Hello.

Did you know rottweilers are attracted
to the scent of whipped cream?

- Matter of fact, I did know that.
- Mm.

- I just learned it.
- Hmm.

Jake almost caught me sneaking out
of Lyndsey's house.

- Really?
- Close call.

- One question.
- Yeah?

Whose idea was it to spice things up
with a large dog?

The dog was not with us in bed.

The dog was being walked
by a 9-year-old girl...

who was not quite capable
of holding onto the leash...

when he got a whiff of my nonfat,
dairy-scented crotch.

Okay, okay.

I'm not judging...

but why was a 9-year-old girl walking
her dog through Lyndsey's bedroom?

No, the girl was on the street
with the dog.

Oh, all right, another question...

I was on the street because
I was sneaking out of Lyndsey's house.

Ah.

You know, for such a boring guy,
you lead a very complicated life.

Yeah, it's a paradox, isn't it?

Iced tea?

When you try to mail your pants
to a garment inspector in Malaysia...

it's time to quit drinking.

Some might say that day came and went
when you gave yourself that haircut.

But good for you.

Yep, long overdue.

- Want a beer?
- You just said you were quitting.

I did and I am.

My drinking days are over.

See? Beer.

- Hello?
- Oh, uh, in here.

- Ix-nay on the ottweiler-ray.
- What?

Oggy-day who tried to ite-bay
my alls-bay. Hey, buddy.

I'm not your buddy.

- What?
- I just came to get my stuff.

- I'm staying with Mom and Herb.
- Why?

I saw you sneaking out
of Eldridge's house.

Oh, Alan, no.

Are you crazy?
Having sex with my best friend's mom?

Hey, shame on you.

I had no idea, Jake.

I was gonna tell you,
you know, eventually.

You're such a liar.

Oh, I'm a liar? What were you doing
at Eldridge's in the first place?

You certainly didn't ask permission
from me.

Attaboy.

Try to take the high road with a crotch
full of whipped cream and dog spittle.

You know, I feel a lot better
since I've stopped drinking.

Yeah, we're all proud of you.

I have more energy,
I'm certainly more clear-headed.

Downside is I might have
to put a chip clip on my johnson...

to keep from peeing my pants.

I really screwed up. I should've been
honest with Jake from the beginning.

Told him
I was seeing his friend's mother.

Or you could've not slept with
his friend's mother in the first place.

Really? You're gonna preach
sexual restraint to me?

Let me explain something to you, Alan.
Jake expects me to betray his trust.

You are held to a higher standard.

- Is that so?
- It is.

You're like some kind of right-wing,
pro-family-values senator...

caught on his knees in an airport toilet
with a male hooker.

Whereas I am a well-known rascal.

When I don't do the wrong thing,
people are disappointed.

Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

No, the story was about me.
God, you're such a narcissist.

You know what, I can't just sit here
and do nothing. I owe Jake an apology.

- You're going to Judith's? I'll come.
- Why?

Why? You're my brother,
I wanna support you.

- Really?
- No, I'm just out of beer.

But I do love
that you still fall for that.

Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

I am. I haven't had a drink all day.

She's talking to me, Charlie.
And, no, I'm not.

Okay, Millie's finally asleep.

- Ooh, is that real beer?
- Knock yourself out.

Oh, thanks.
I'm going to regret this in the morning.

My God, Alan, I can't believe
you're sleeping with Lyndsey MacElroy.

You're sleeping
with Lyndsey MacElroy?

My man.

- How could you do that?
- Yeah, how? Don't leave anything out.

It just happened. Her son and Jake
are friends, which is how we met...

and we, you know, hit it off.

You don't sleep
with your son's friend's mother.

No, no, you marry his pediatrician.

He's got you there, sweetie.

There's a rumor going around...

that Lyndsey was in a porn movie
before she got married.

Really, which one?

I don't know, I've been checking
Cinemax every night for months.

- Oh, I love their stuff.
- It's classy, right?

A little story, nice lighting,
and you never have to see the guy's junk.

What is wrong with you?

You don't like seeing that stuff either.

I think that's enough beer, sweetheart.
I'll get Jake.

There you go, pal.

Thanks, but you heard her.
I've had enough.

Boy, oh, boy, Lyndsey MacElroy.

You are one lucky ducky.

- Yeah, she's very beautiful.
- Yeah.

Sometimes I drive past her house...

she's out watering her lawn in her
shorty shorts and halter top, cowabunga.

No one wants to talk to him,
but he's your father.

- Oh, hey, buddy.
- What do you want?

What I want is to apologize for not
telling you about me and Eldridge's mom.

You know, this is between you guys.
I'm just gonna go take a hot shower.

Eldridge doesn't wanna be friends
with me.

Oh, I am so sorry. This can't be the first
time something like this happened.

How many times has Charlie slept
with somebody you knew?

Yeah, but I expect that from him.

See, Alan? I'm Teflon.

You're a perv, is what you are.

It's not just that you were sleeping
with her, you lied.

You're right. I should've told you the truth
and Lyndsey should've told Eldridge.

But when it happened,
we didn't know if it would even last.

- I don't like you keeping things from me.
- That's fair and I'll make you a deal.

From now on, I will be open and honest
with you, you'll do the same with me.

- Deal?
- I guess.

Thanks.

I have to go finish my homework.

- Hey, so I'll see you this weekend?
- Sure.

Great. Love you, buddy.

Don't push it, Dad.

You're lucky he's so forgiving.

Takes after his mom, huh?

Um, you know, we should go.

I gotta pee. You mind, Judith?

Just try to hit the bowl this time.

Don't worry,
I only miss when I've been drinking.

I'll wait in the car.

Hey, Judith?

Is there surfing around here?

What? We're 20 miles from the beach.

That's what I thought.

I am so proud of that kid.

Isn't this nice?

The four of us sitting down, having
dinner, open, honest, no secrets? Heh.

- Yeah.
- Thrilling.

So, Jake, your dad tells me
you're getting into the surfing scene.

- What do you mean?
- You know, uh, Tiffany and Joanne.

Oh, yeah, right.

Tiffany and Joanne surf?

Yes, Eldridge. They surf.

Charlie, would you like some pizza?

No, thanks,
I'm kind of on a health kick.

- Didn't you tell me he quit drinking?
- He actually thinks he did.

Hello? Oh, hey, Herb. What's up?

Really? Right now?

Hang on.

Are you sure?

Wait, wait, wait.

- Hey, Lyndsey?
- Mm?

Never mind.

You're right, it's her.

Okay, Herb, thanks.

Well, great, great. Have a nice shower.

Boy, she sure does like
the whipped cream.

.......... ********** ..........

Sorry.

It's okay, Alan.

I don't have to have an orgasm
every time we make love.

I did my best.
It's just that my sinuses are blocked...

and I needed my mouth
for breathing.

Don't worry about it. You were great.
A for effort.

Yeah. But on my report card,
it's still gonna say, "Incomplete."

Don't dwell on that.
Let's just enjoy being together.

Mm! I am enjoying it. Ooh, thirsty.

I need to tell you something.

Uh-huh.

I think I love you, Alan Harper.

Did it go down the wrong way?

Yeah, that seems to be
the theme of the evening.

Are you gonna leave me hanging?

You said it was okay.
You told me to stop.

You know what I mean.
I just told you I love you.

Oh! Oh, that. Oh, uh, well, you know,
I mean, it goes without saying...

that I feel the same way.

- Then say it.
- Pfft. Okay. Pfft.

I love you, Lyndsey.

Why?

- Why?
- What do you love about me?

Oh, well, what's not to love?
I mean, you know, you're beautiful...

and strong, and smart, and sexy.

Uh-huh.

Uh, confident. Um...

Loyal.

Thrifty.

Clean.

Yeah?

Persistent.

- Why do you love me?
- I don't know. I just do.

That's not fair.
Why'd I get the essay question?

I think you should move in.

Ugh.

- You want me to move in here?
- Why not? We love each other.

Plus, our sons get along.
They can walk to school from here.

Jake's mom lives
just down the street...

and there's plenty of room for him
here on weekends.

- You've been giving this a lot of thought.
- I have.

Is that why I got an incomplete?
Because you were distracted?

No.

Oh.

Can you think of any reasons
why we shouldn't live together?

Uh, no. Not off the top of my head...

which you were staring at
for quite a while.

I don't wanna back you into a corner.
Why don't you think about it?

Yeah. Why don't I sit with it
for a day or two?

And you can think about
why you love me. Heh.

Okay.

- Ha, ha.
- Mm.

Oh. Aw, I guess I should be
getting home soon.

- If you lived here, you'd be home already.
- Ha.

That's true.

It's funny, uh, I always see
those signs on the freeway:

"If you lived here,
you'd be home already."

You know, I can't help but think
if I lived there...

I'd have a sign
outside my window...

ruining my perfectly good view
of the freeway.

And if you lived next to the freeway,
you wouldn't be getting this.

Mm-mm. Hang on.
Just wet the old whistle.

My mouth.
I'm talking about my mouth.

Yeah, hi.

I'm watching your commercial
"Cash4Gold."

And you just showed a woman
selling her wedding ring for $500.

No, I don't wanna sell gold,
I wanna meet that woman.

She's hot, and we know
her marriage isn't working out.

- Hey.
- Call you back.

- You got any gold in your teeth?
- A little. Why?

Just thinking.

Lyndsey told me
she loves me tonight.

- Really? What'd you say?
- Well, what could I say? "I love you too."

- Do you love her?
- Yeah, sure. What's not to love?

Oh, I don't know.
Her mood swings...

her idiot teenage son,
and the fact that you need...

a muscle relaxer, a bottle of wine
and a jackhammer to get her off.

Hey, I told you about that
in confidence.

Who else is here?

The same two people know.

All right, well, let's keep it that way.

She also said
she wants me to move in with her.

Is that forever
or just till you get her off?

- Charlie...
- You're right.

That's a distinction
without a difference.

Are you listening to me?

Lyndsey said she wants me
to move out of here and in with her.

Oh, you were serious?

Well, that's great. Congratulations.
When are you leaving?

I don't know.
I told her I'd think about it.

What's to think about? She's a terrific
gal, and she can make you happy.

- But you just said...
- Oh, please.

That was just me cracking wise.

Everybody's got a little baggage.

I drink
and try to mouth-kiss hookers.

You, you're cheap, annoying...

and no one likes you.
- Lyndsey likes me.

Which is why
you should move in with her.

But this is my home.
I'm comfortable here.

No, no, no. This is my home.

And before you moved into it,
I was comfortable here.

Now, now. You always say that,
but you don't mean it.

Well, yes, I do.
Why won't you ever believe me?

After all these years, you're saying
you wouldn't miss me if I was gone?

I'm saying I'd very much like
the chance to find out.

- Please, Alan, give me that chance.
- No, I don't think so.

My relationship with Lyndsey
is fine the way it is.

I can come and go as I please.
I have my own space.

No, no, no. No.
No, you have my space.

Also a distinction
without a difference.

- So that's it? You're not leaving?
- Like I said, I'm comfortable here.

Comfortable, huh?
Okay, my path is clear.

Ooh.

I can grow tomatoes upside down.

Hey. You awake?

- No, I can keep going.
- Alan. Alan.

- Mm. Oh, hi. What's up?
- I need a favor.

Okay, sure. What is it?

I got this girl upstairs,
and I need you to take care of her bird.

Okay, when you say "bird,"
what exactly is it you're referring to?

Get your mind out of the gutter.

Her bird. Here.

Guess what his name is.

- Mothra?
- Larry. Larry Bird?

Get it? This chick's from Boston.

Anyway, I'd put him in the living room,
but Larry didn't like to be alone.

- Okay, I guess.
- Thanks.

Oh, yeah.
Don't put your hands near his face.

And if you get up to pee,
make sure you close the bathroom door.

- Why?
- I don't know.

He's got this thing about penises.
He thinks they're big worms.

Or L.A. Lakers. Good night.

Good night.

Caw! Spank me.

- What?
- I'm a bad girl. Spank me.

Oh, for God's sake.

Too big, too big.

All right. All right, Larry.
Go to sleep.

That's it, baby. Oh, yeah.
You're the best.

Damn it.

Not a worm! Not a worm! Aah! Agh!

And let me tell you, it wasn't easy
finding a hooker with a big bird.

- Ha-ha-ha.
- Snakes, no problem. They all got snakes.

Shh! Shh, shh! Here he comes.

Thanks again for watching Larry.

I'd say, "Bite me,"
but that's been taken care of.

Hey, I'm sorry
if that made you uncomfortable...

but from time to time,
I do entertain women in this house.

That thing tried to re-circumcise me.

Maybe that's why
they call it a cockatoo.

I know what you're doing.
It's not gonna work.

Whatever are you talking about?

I tell you I'm not moving in
with Lyndsey because I'm comfortable.

Three hours later, you put
a giant penis-eating parrot in my room.

And you think there's a connection?

Yes, I think there's a connection.

Damn it. How do you get a guy to leave
your house who doesn't wanna go?

Tell him you missed your period
and you're out of pot.

Always worked for me.

Hey, Alan,
how are you with the Jumble?

Charlie. What are you doing in here?

Right now, the Jumble.

"O-L-C-U-D."

"Cloud."

"Cloud." Thank you.

What are you doing in my bathroom?

Not much yet,
but I have high hopes.

Come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I making you uncomfortable?

Not enough to make me
move in with Lyndsey.

Okay.

How about now?

Bottom line. What would it take to
make you wanna move in with Lyndsey?

There is no circumstance
where I would entertain leaving Malibu...

and moving in with Lyndsey.

Next time you drop the soap,
I'm gonna forget you're my brother.

Jake, your father's here!

- Hello, Alan. Charlie, how's it going?
- Great.

Did you hear Lyndsey MacElroy
invited Alan to move in with her?

- What? She lives right down the street.
- You and Alan would be neighbors.

- I didn't say I was gonna do it.
- You bet your ass you're not gonna do it.

I will not have my ex-husband
living down the street.

You're saying
that would make you uncomfortable?

Uncomfortable?
It would drive me crazy.

Jake, damn it, get a move on!

I'm moving in with Lyndsey.

How's the pizza?

- Awesome.
- Great.

It's a new takeout place.
A little more expensive, but it's worth it.

And for dessert
we have red-velvet cupcakes.

- Oh, man, those are my favorite.
- Hang on, Eldridge.

Something's wrong here.

Are you sending us to military school?

- No. Why would you think that?
- Of course not.

Sixteen years of bargain pizza
with fake cheese...

and Sam's Club vanilla wafers
for dessert?

- I don't wanna go to military school.
- No one's going to military school.

But there is, uh, something
we wanted to talk to you about.

Here it comes.

Relax. It's good news. Alan?

All right. Uh, as you both know...

Lyndsey and I have been dating now
for six months.

Oh, man. Did he knock you up?

No. Just be quiet and listen.

Anyway, uh, we've both grown
very fond of each other during that time.

You are using protection, right?

That's none of your business...

but I'm glad you're paying attention
in health class.

But what I'm trying to say
is that Lyndsey and I...

have decided to live together.

I don't think Uncle Charlie's
gonna like that.

He's never been real pleased
that you and I moved in.

Uh, no, no, no. We're gonna live
at Lyndsey's and Eldridge's house.

But I stay here, right?

When you're not at your mom's,
you'll be with us.

So I'm losing
my weekend beach house?

Yeah, but you're gaining
a whole family.

I'd rather have
a weekend beach house.

- Do I have to share my bathroom with?
- Eldridge.

What's wrong
with sharing a bathroom with me?

- I like my privacy.
- We know what that's about.

- Jake.
- You're Mr. Whack-a-Mole, not me.

- Well, at least I don't watch gay porn.
- That was a total accident.

- I don't wanna live with him.
- Don't worry. I'm not going.

- Guys, guys, come on.
- No.

It's bad enough
you're sleeping with this loser.

- Eldridge.
- Are you calling my dad a loser?

- You call him a loser all the time.
- He's my dad. I'm allowed.

- Jake, you're not allowed.
- Is it okay for me to call your mom...

what you call her?
- What do you call me?

Okay, we've gotten off track here.
Heh, um.

Who's ready for cupcakes?

- Screw you and your cupcakes.
- Yeah.

I'll just, uh, take one for later.

Happy days are here again

The skies above are clear again

I'm getting rid of the queer again

Happy days are here again

- Hey.
- Hey there.

- Ho there.
- What are you doing?

Just thought I'd help you get a jump
on the packing.

Oh, well, you can unpack,
because I'm not leaving.

- What? No.
- The boys just won't go along with it.

- You're giving those two morons a vote?
- It's too traumatic.

- Turning their lives upside down.
- So? Let them be traumatized.

That's the trouble with kids these days:
Not enough trauma.

I know you were looking forward
to having the house back to yourself...

but it's just not gonna happen.
- Oh, it's gonna happen.

As God is my witness,
and by all that's holy, it's gonna happen.

Amen. Keep packing.

He couldn't spell "miscellaneous"?

It's my house.
I don't need your permission.

I don't care.
I'll go live with Dad and Stephanie.

Aw, won't that be nice? You'll be
reunited with your old babysitter.

Excuse us. Walk.

- Dude.
- Don't "dude" me.

I'm in no mood for "dude."

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

- Dude.
- Don't "dude" him, dude.

What's this about you not wanting
to live together?

- I like it here.
- I want my privacy, and...

It was a rhetorical question.
I don't give a rat's ass.

Now, the happiness of your parents
is at stake here.

We're gonna reason this out like adults
in the interest of all involved.

Here's $500.

Split it up any way you want.

- Nice.
- And that's just a down payment.

There's 100 for every month
you keep my brother out of my house.

A hundred dollars a month?
That's like $1000 a year.

Almost.

- Do we have a deal?
- Deal.

Great.

I should write a book on parenting.

- How are we supposed to split this?
- I don't know, dude.

No matter how I figure it,
there's gonna be one left over.

Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back

No more, no more
No more, no more

Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more

- Okay, we're leaving.
- What you say?

I said we're all packed
and we're leaving.

I know. I know. I heard you.
I just never get tired of hearing it.

- Jake, say goodbye to your uncle.
- Bye.

- Bye.
- That's it? After all these years?

Um, I had a good time here.

Who wouldn't?
It's a beach house in Malibu.

That's what I told him.

So I guess I'll see you
at your high school graduation.

Heh, good one.

- I'll meet you at Lyndsey's.
- Drive safe.

Well, here we are.

- The final goodbye.
- One can only hope.

Come here.

You've been a good brother.
You were here when I needed you.

- I will be forever in your debt.
- So it's official:

You're never paying me back.

Boy, we had some great times
in this old place.

You're walking the wrong way, Alan.

Remember when you set us up...

with two hot soap-opera actresses
and then we both got the flu?

- Ha-ha-ha.
- Soap-opera actresses?

No. Doesn't ring a bell.
Drive carefully.

Oh, come on. Um, how about when
you found me handcuffed to my bed...

wearing a bustier
and fishnet stockings?

- Sorry. Blanking on that too.
- But you gotta remember when...

Let me save you some trouble.
My past is divided...

between things I can't remember
and things I don't wanna remember.

You're both.

Right. Then, uh, wish me luck.

You don't need luck.
You guys were meant for each other.

In fact, let me start you off
on the right foot.

Here's $100. Stop by the liquor store,
pick up a bottle of champagne...

to celebrate with Lyndsey.
- Hundred bucks?

For that kind of cash, I could get
a decent bottle of Chardonnay...

and still have
some walking-around money.

- Get the champagne, Alan.
- Right. It's your money. Ha, ha.

Exactly. We end as we began.

All right, so, uh, I guess I'll call you.

Yeah. Make sure
you leave a message.

Ha-ha-ha. That's what I'm gonna miss.

The banter,
the good-natured ribbing, the...

I admit I had my doubts, Lord...

but you have delivered me
unto the Promised Land.

You're right,
I should change the locks.

That's why you're the Lord.

Boy, I didn't even realize
they made wine in Oklahoma.

- That'll be 8.49.
- Mm. Here you are.

That's a hundred-dollar bill.

You owe me $91.51.

- Alan?
- Melissa?

- What a coincidence.
- Yeah. How have you been?

- Okay. You?
- Uh, fine. Ha.

- How's Jake?
- Oh, uh, he's good.

- Charlie?
- Ah, pfft. Same old.

- Ha, ha. You look great.
- Oh, you too. Gorgeous.

- Aw, thanks. Ha. Ahem.
- Ha-ha-ha.

- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

- So seeing anybody?
- Nope. You?

Nope.

Must be real important for you to call me
out in the middle of the night like this.

You're doing God's work.

Excuse me. Pardon me.

- Alan?
- I'll explain later.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

I'm still moving in with Lyndsey.
This'll just be my pied-à-terre.

Uh, that's French for "love shack."

Okay, that's it.
Let me speak to your supervisor.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

I think you should move in.

- You bet your ass you're not gonna do it.
- I'm moving in with Lyndsey.

- Alan?
- Lyndsey and I...

have decided to live together.

Well, here we are. The final goodbye.

One can only hope.

- Alan?
- Melissa?

- I've missed you.
- So seeing anybody?

- Nope. You?
- Nope.

- Alan?
- I'll explain later.

Hey, Charlie.

I'm still moving in with Lyndsey.
This will just be my pied-à-terre.

I'm sorry I have to go.

Me too. I mean, that you have to go,
not that I have to go.

Why would I have to go?
I live here. Heh.

- Can we do this again?
- Again?

Well, maybe you can do it again,
but men are different.

I mean, another time.

Oh, sure. Why not? I live here.

- Ha, ha. Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

All right.
I know what you're gonna say.

I don't think you do.

It was wrong, I'm cheating on Lyndsey,
I'm lying to Melissa.

No, no, no. What I was gonna say is...

you don't live here. You moved out.

Not officially.
I never made it to Lyndsey's house.

- Speaking of which, I should get going.
- Alan, listen to me.

If you screw this up,
you're gonna wind up back here.

You need to understand something.
There is no "back here."

I got it, got it. It was a crazy impulse.

Ha, ha. Old girlfriend,
it was a one-time thing.

Uh, well, technically,
it was a two-time thing.

Second one was in the shower.

Well, that is where
you've been practicing.

You know, you have to admit,
this is a very curious turn of events.

I mean, seven years ago...

I arrived on this very doorstep,
heartbroken and alone...

and you had chicks
coming out the kazoo.

Now look at us.
The student has become the master.

Arigato, sensei.

Ow!

You're welcome, grasshopper.

Lyndsey? You in here?

- What took so long?
- I was getting worried.

Well, uh, saying goodbye to Charlie
turned out to be tougher...

than I thought it was gonna be.

He didn't wanna see
his baby brother go.

- You're kidding.
- Nope.

Charlie may be prickly
and crusty on the outside...

but inside, he's all soft and gooey.

Kind of like a pudding-filled cactus.

Well, I'm glad you're back because
I have a moving-in present for you.

Oh, great. Please don't be sex,
please don't be sex, please don't be sex.

Ta-da.

Oh, boy, sex.

Mm.

I sent the kids to the movies
so it's just you and me.

So no interruptions. Goodie.

Come on, unwrap your present.

All right, um, but how about
we make this one about your pleasure?

- Aren't you in the mood?
- Of course I'm in the mood. I'm a man.

Men are always in the mood, heh.
Hmm...

Sex.

How about we do the first one fast
and the second one nice and slow?

- Heh, second one?
- Mm... Mm...

Oh, yay.

End of an era, huh, Charlie?

Yep. From now on,
no brother, no nephew...

just the sounds of the ocean...

punctuated by the soft voices
of prostitutes...

lying about the enormity
of my sexual organ.

You do know how to paint a picture.

What can I say?
I have the heart of a poet.

Unfortunately, the rest of you
is a drunken scumbag.

Cheers.

Ahh!

Hello?

Don't move, don't breathe.

Charlie? Berta?

Oh, there you are.

Um, listen, I know I said
it was a one-time thing with Melissa...

but she called and wanted to see me
and I just couldn't say no.

So she's coming here?

This is where I live, you know,
as far as she's concerned.

- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Take your time.

Thank you.

Come, let's talk.

- Here's the thing...
- Are you insane?

- Have you lost your mind?
- I know my future is with Lyndsey...

but I have so much chemistry
with Melissa.

- You can't keep this up.
- I know.

Last time,
I had to fake an orgasm with Lyndsey.

What? How does a man fake an orgasm?

I get it.

Please. Please, I'm begging you.

- Oh, okay, that's Melissa.
- No, Alan, this ends now.

I swear, last time. You got any Viagra?

What?

Not for now, for when I go home.
So I don't have to, you know:

- God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

I know a guy.

Ten grand,
you'll never have to see zippy again.

Ten grand?

Actually, he charges 500
but there's a finder's fee.

- Alan, dinner's on the table.
- Coming.

- You're a great cook, Mrs. MacElroy.
- Jake, I told you. Call me Lyndsey.

- Yes, ma'am.
- You are such a sweetie.

You could learn something from him.

- Suck up.
- Suck up with a drumstick.

I noticed this pipe on the mantel.

- It's a beauty.
- It was my grandfather's.

Oh, wow.
They don't make them like this anymore.

Hello, boys. How about
a little orange juice with your dinner?

Ba-ba-ba-bum.

- Is he high?
- I wish.

- I love a man with a pipe.
- Ha, ha.

You should get some tobacco for it.

Your dad's gonna smoke
a dead guy's pipe.

At least he didn't get hair plugs and
run off with my babysitter like your dad.

- Ow.
- Ow.

Now, boys, behave yourselves...

or I'll pull out my b-b-b-belt.

Alan, sit down.
White meat or dark meat?

I'll take a b-b-b-breast.

- Is that supposed to be somebody?
- It's Bing Crosby.

Oh! Heh.

- Who?
- Bing Crosby.

The black guy with the sweater,
used to have a TV show.

That's Will Smith, dumb-ass.

Hmm.

That's weird.

Hey, Charlie.

Oh, boy.

Isn't this nice,
eating together as a family?

It certainly is, Mother.

Maybe afterwards we can gather round
the fireside and sing a song or two.

Seriously, Alan,
that's not funny anymore.

- And don't call me Mother.
- Sorry.

And in this house, we don't talk
on the phone during dinner.

Oh, right, yeah.

Terrific rule,
but, uh, I just have to take this.

Hey, Charlie. What's up?

Oh, she's there now?

Well, what do you want me to do?

We're all gonna die, Charlie.

No, no, no.
Don't send her over here.

No. I'll be right there.
Just give me a minute.

Okay, let me tell you something.

This is now my house too.

If I want to talk on the phone,
I'm going to.

- What's wrong with you?
- Don't you nag me, woman.

- Where are you going?
- I am going to take a drive and cool off.

Mother.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

Doesn't Alan usually come home
right after work?

- Usually.
- Hope he didn't get into an accident.

No, I'm not that lucky.

- How can you say that?
- I'm just stating a fact.

Charlie, I'm home from work.
Oh, Melissa, ha, ha, what the heck?

I wanted to surprise you,
but you were so late we started to worry.

She's using the royal "we."

I would've been home earlier, but we had
a, uh, little situation at the office.

Oh, no. What happened?

Um, well, I, uh, lost a patient.

Oh, my God, someone died?

Oh, no, no.
Not, you know, lost like died.

Uh, more like, uh, uh, misplaced.

- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.

- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

I'm just wondering. How does
a chiropractor misplace a patient?

- Good question.
- I thought so.

Well, uh, he's an elderly fellow...

uh, who in addition to scoliosis...

also has dementia.

I just spent the last hour and a half
driving up Ventura Boulevard...

looking for a, you know, shirtless,
hunched-over, 80-year-old man.

Found quite a few, heh.

But, uh, none of them were mine.

So he's still out there?

Yeah.

Did you call the police?

Yes, Charlie, I did.

What did they say?

They thanked me for my help...

and told me to go home
and let them do their job.

So here I am. Home.

- Better late than never.
- Oh, please.

You've never given never a chance.

Do you mind?

I do. I thought I made that clear.

All right, all right.

- Melissa, we can't do this anymore.
- I agree.

- You do?
- Yes.

I think I should move in here with you.

- Here?
- Here?

Why don't we talk about it
after we make love?

Okay.

It could work.

I'm just gonna go home
and get some things.

- I'll be back in a little while.
- Great.

That's really getting annoying.

Do me a favor, talk me through this.

- Excuse me?
- What's your strategy?

Explain it to me, Lucy.

Okay, admittedly I may have overplayed
my hand a little.

A little?

You're living with Lyndsey
and you asked Melissa to move in here.

Yeah, I gotta work on that.

So listen, when Melissa comes back,
make some sort of excuse.

What? Like I was cruising
Ventura Boulevard...

for an old, shirtless hunchback?

Yeah, not my finest moment.
You're experienced at that kind of thing.

No, no, I'm experienced at promiscuity.

This is polygamy. And frankly,
I find it extremely distasteful.

Oh, this you find distasteful?

The man who was asked
to leave Bangkok for moral turpitude...

finds this distasteful?

That was a misunderstanding.

I had no idea
it was an endangered species.

Nothing I'm doing requires
a 10-day quarantine...

and a series of rabies shots.

- Oh, hello.
- Oh, Mom, thank God you're here.

Your sarcasm is unappreciated,
Charlie.

No, really. You gotta talk to Alan,
tell him not to screw up with Lyndsey.

- Who's Lyndsey?
- My girlfriend.

- You have a girlfriend?
- He moved in with her.

You moved in with a girlfriend?

Yeah. He's cheating
with his ex-girlfriend...

and he invited that one
to move in here.

When were you planning
to tell me all this?

- We're telling you now.
- So as usual, I'm the last to know.

Mom, Mom, focus.

He moved out. After seven years
of putting up with him and his kid...

he finally moved.
I need him to stay out.

So Jake is gone too?
No one thought to call me.

Okay, as usual, you're just useless.

Alan, this can't go on any longer.
You have to choose...

between Lyndsey and Melissa
and you have to choose now.

You're right, you're right.

What to do?

When did he start smoking a pipe?

I don't know. This is new.

- That's probably Lyndsey.
- Which one is Lyndsey?

- The one he moved in with.
- What's wrong with her?

- Single mom, teenage son.
- So, desperate?

Like a goldfish in a leaky bag.

Oh, my God.
Lyndsey is apologizing to me, ha, ha...

says she was wrong.

- About what?
- What difference does it make?

I won an argument with a woman.

Which is why she's the gal for you.
Go to her. Love her. Cherish her.

I don't know.

Okay, then take her for granted...

and treat her like crap
until she hangs herself, but go.

- What about Melissa?
- You have to break that off.

You're right. You're right.
I have to step up and be a man.

- What are you doing?
- Telling Melissa it's over.

With a text?

Well, I'm putting a little sad face
at the end.

All right.
Well, uh, I guess it's time to go home...

and come clean with Lyndsey.
- No, no, no. No coming clean.

Unless you're banging Mr. Bubble.

I don't want to build our new life
together on a foundation of lies.

Oh, yes, you do.

Listen to your mother.

Trust me. No good ever comes
from revealing an indiscretion.

And you know this how?

I'd rather not say.

You're saying when you were married...

Whoa, whoa.
When did everything become about me?

When we were born.

Don't get me started on that.
My episiotomy still itches.

My point, Alan, is it is not fair
to ease your conscience...

by dumping your sins
on the woman you love.

Yeah, Alan, don't be selfish.

Oh, what now?

Oh, Melissa is not taking it well.

"I hate you, you stupid cork-soaker"?

Auto spellcheck. Anyway.

I gotta go. Bye, Mom.

- Ahh, okay, dodged a bullet.
- Yep.

So now that he's gone, what are you
gonna do with that empty room?

- Uh, why do you ask?
- I was just thinking...

it might be nice to spend the
occasional weekend here on the beach.

Oh, darling, you should see your face.

- Hey.
- Oh, thank God you're back.

- Sorry I stormed off like that.
- No, no.

You had every right.

Sorry I treated you like
some kind of house guest.

Oh, that's okay, I'm used to it.

Seven years with Charlie,
a dozen years with Judith...

and all that time with my mom.

Well, from now on,
this house is your home.

If you wanna talk on the phone...

you just go right ahead and do it.
- Really?

Can I hang my
Chiropractor of the Year plaque?

- Of course.
- In the living room?

Wherever you want.

Charlie made me hang it
in my bathroom.

I'm not Charlie, and I'm proud
you're chiropractor of the year.

Oh, not this year. 2002.

After that,
they tightened up the voting rules.

So, uh, what about acidophilus milk?

- What about it?
- I like it.

- Then we'll get it.
- I can keep it in the refrigerator?

Where else would you?

Charlie made me keep all my dairy
products in an ice chest in the garage.

That's terrible.

I lost so much cheese.

Oh, honey.
Well, this is your home now...

and you can put your cheese
wherever you want.

Sing show tunes in the shower?

- Charlie didn't let you sing show tunes?
- That was my mother.

Said I was effeminate enough already.

Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you are all man.

Oh, Lyndsey, you're too good to me.

Oh, it's only what you deserve.

Okay, I can't live with this guilt.
I have to confess something.

What?

Okay, a few days ago
I ran into an ex-girlfriend...

who I had a lot of chemistry with.
- You had sex.

Let me finish.

No.

I did not have sex with her.

Then why do you feel guilty?

Uh... Well, after I ran into her...

I, uh, uh, found myself...

fantasizing about her.

- Fantasizing? That's it?
- That's it.

And nothing crazy,
just straight missionary.

Sweetie, we all fantasize.

Every time I go to the car wash...

I imagine myself
being bent over a soapy BMW...

by a man with callused hands
and no green card.

Really? Every time?

It's not always a BMW.

Come on, let's go to bed.

- Ha, ha.
- Don't ruin it.

Crap.

- Where is he?
- I don't know.

I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Where is he?

I'm sorry. I don't...

- What's going on?
- She kneed me in the nuts.

- What'd you do to her?
- Nothing.

- What'd he do to you?
- He won't tell me where his brother is.

I can't. I'm not a rat.

What are you gonna do to Alan
when you find him?

Same thing I did to Charlie,
but worse.

He's at Lyndsey's.
1182 Bonnie Meadow Drive.

Sherman Oaks. Big blue house.

I'm sorry, Charlie.

Oh, stop whining.

On some level,
I'm sure you had it coming.

So I was thinking of turning
that little storage room into a den.

You know, kind of a man cave.

Whatever you want, sweetie.

- Really?
- Mm-hm.

So I can get a flat screen,
maybe a wet bar?

If that's what it takes
to make you happy here.

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Enough talking,
let's make love in our home.

Oh, yes, our home.

Do you smell something burning?

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

How are you feeling?

I think she punched my right nut
up into my rib cage.

Poor baby.
You want Mommy to take a look?

No, thanks.

- I have seen them before.
- I know.

I imagine they're hanging
a lot lower now.

Right back at you, Mom.

Touché, darling.

You will never guess what happened.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

- Alan?
- Lyndsey and I...

have decided to live together.

End of an era, huh, Charlie?

From now on, no brother, no nephew...

just the sounds of the ocean...

punctuated by the soft voices
of prostitutes...

lying about the enormity
of my sexual organ.

Alan, dinner's on the table.

I, uh, noticed this old pipe
on the mantel. It's a beauty.

It was my grandfather's.

Wow. They don't make them
like this anymore.

So now that he's gone, what are you
gonna do with that empty room?

- Uh, why do you ask?
- I was just thinking...

it might be nice to spend the
occasional weekend here on the beach.

From now on, this house is your home.

Do you smell something burning?

Whew. What a day.

Who could've seen this one coming?

Oh, please. After seven years,
I finally move out of your house...

and within two days,
I burn my new home down.

You can't write this stuff.

I could if I used your skin for paper
and your blood for ink.

As soon as we get the insurance money
and repair the fire damage...

Lyndsey and the boys and I
will be out of your hair for good.

Unless, of course,
you burn her house down again.

Funny. See, that's what we need
at times like this, laughter.

I'm gonna take that as laughter.

Trust me, Eldridge is a great kid
and you're gonna love Lyndsey.

If you can open up your mind a little,
you will really enjoy having them here.

Damn it, Eldridge.

Why would you try to flush
a washcloth down the toilet?

Not enjoying it yet, Alan.

- Charlie, you got a mop?
- Laundry room.

- Thank you.
- Uh, need any help, sweetie?

No, but if I need my house
burned down again, I'll let you know.

See? She is keeping
a sense of humor about it.

You've ruined my entire life,
you know that?

You're right, I like her.
We've got a lot in common.

What do you want me to tell you?

If you wanna see your son,
you're gonna have to come to Malibu.

Grow up. You think I planned
to have the house burn down?

It was an accident.

It was, you know.

Drop dead.

Whew. I'd say
she's a little miffed with your dad.

- I'd say she wants to tear him a new one.
- Hey, watch your language.

- What'd I say?
- "New one."

Mm. Honey? Honey?

Uh, just a little heads up, um,
the boys could hear you out there.

I don't give a rat's ass
what they can hear.

His father's a jerk and
you burned down my freaking house.

Our house.

Dear God, stop talking.

Oh, damn.

Hey, Berta.
Bet you're surprised to see me back.

It's my own fault. I let myself believe.

Want you to meet my girlfriend, Lyndsey.
Uh, and this is her son, Eldridge.

They're gonna be staying with us
for a while.

What'd he do? Burn down your house?

It was an accident.

Hello, everyone. I hope you all slept well.
If there's anything I can do...

to make your stay more comfortable,
please be sure to tell me.

- Thank you, Charlie, that's so...
- Uh, he doesn't mean it.

- Hey, Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

You miss me?

He missed me.

Honestly, I don't see
why you can't live here.

You're kidding, right? There's no roof.

So wear a hat.

My great grandmother's candlesticks.

Oh, Lyndsey, I'm sorry.

She smuggled these out of Denmark
when the Nazis invaded.

Really? Where'd she hide them?

- Charlie, don't go there.
- Like I'm the only one?

Look at the bright side. Even though
we've lost some material items...

the important thing is we're all safe
and we've still got each other. Right?

You're making my skin crawl.

Hey, guys? Smile.

It's for your Christmas card.

- My stuff is wrecked.
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

Sorry isn't gonna bring back
my guitar or my Xbox...

or the history paper due tomorrow
that I totally had finished.

Where's Eldridge? He's drying out
his weed in the backyard.

Weed?

Wii. Nintendo Wii.
I better go help him.

I could use a little Wii right now.

Is this my Armani jacket?

Oh, yeah, you know, I don't know
how that got in with my things.

I was gonna bring it back.

But now that you're here, why don't you
just take it with you? Saves me the trip.

You know what? Happy birthday.

Not much of a birthday present.

- Ding dong.
- Hi, neighbor.

- We saw your cars out front.
- Hey, Judith. Incredible, huh?

Wow. This place is a wreck.

But still livable.

What are you gonna do?

Until the place gets fixed up,
we're staying in Malibu with Charlie.

Really? All of you. At Charlie's.

- What are you smiling about?
- You know what I'm smiling about.

Well, I hope the repairs go quickly
so we get you back here real soon.

Thanks.

I'm gonna miss your friendly face every
morning when I'm getting the paper.

- Every morning?
- Our, uh, schedules synch up...

when I'm doing my power walk.

Power walk?

- What are you smiling about?
- You know what I'm smiling about.

Hey.

My pipe survived. It's like a miracle.

Filthy habit.

Oh, look, look, look.
The Towering Inferno is on.

No?

Oh. Stephen King's Firestarter.

No? All right.

How about Blazing Saddles?

Too soon?

You guys are no fun.

I'm gonna call a hooker.

Charlie, there's two young boys
in the house.

- Let them get their own hookers.
- Charlie, for God's sake...

Don't worry. I'm a responsible uncle.

- That's nice to know.
- I promise I'll get a quiet prostitute.

Believe it or not,
that's a real concession on his part.

Where is my phone?

Oh, right, I must have left it
in the charred...

but still very livable remains
of your house.

Which he burned down.

You're gonna go over there now?

My hooker numbers are in that phone.
Unless you wanna have sex with me...

for a thousand dollars an hour,
I need the phone.

You don't really think he'd give me
a thousand dollars an hour?

If I were you,
I'd get the money up-front.

Ah.

There we are.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H...

Hookers.

Hookers, hookers, hookers.

Looking for a quiet hooker.

Ah. There we go, Silent Betty.

Not a lot of coverage in here.

- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

You're right.
Let's just stay mysterious strangers.

This used to be my house, you know.

- You're the ex-husband?
- Chris MacElroy.

- Charlie Harper.
- Alan's brother?

I don't usually admit it, but yeah.

What are you doing here, Chris?

I wanted to see what the damage was
and just, you know, sit here.

Try and figure out
where it all went wrong.

What'd you come up with?

I probably shouldn't have banged
the babysitter.

Yeah, that can do it.

I did a babysitter once.
My mom was furious.

Wouldn't drive her home
and absolutely refused to pay her.

- Want a drink?
- Sure, why not?

To babysitters.

Is this a private party
or can anyone join?

Hey, Herb. Come on in.

Hey, Chris. Long time no see.

Likewise. Grab a seat, have a drink.

Oh, gee, I don't know. I, uh, told Judith
I was taking out the garbage.

What the heck,
didn't say where I was taking it.

So you two guys know each other?

Are you kidding? Chris is a legend
in this neighborhood.

- What was she, like, uh, 19?
- Twenty-two.

Nevertheless,
quite an accomplishment.

Ah. Hey, is she still babysitting?

We're looking for somebody. Everybody
Judith interviews is fat and ugly.

Take it from me, Herb,
you're better off with fat and ugly.

Oh, I hardly think so.

You'd really be willing to risk your
marriage over a cute, young babysitter?

I certainly wouldn't risk it
over a fat, ugly one.

Can't argue with that.

I made us a snacky snack.

Swell.

Uh, we have onion dip and cool ranch.

Always good to have a choice of dips.

And I chose you.

Zing.

- What are you doing?
- Just getting comfy.

Snuggling up
on the world's best pillow.

Mm.

That was an accident, right?

Sure.

Let's call it an accident.

- Hey, can you take me back to Mom's?
- Why?

Eldridge is being a tool. Whoa!

- Dad.
- It wasn't me, it was...

Yeah, I'll take you back
to your mom's.

- Hey, Alan?
- What?

Try not to burn down her house.

Yeah, ha-ha. You might wanna light
some matches while I'm gone.

So, Chris,
what are you up to these days?

Not a lot. After Lyndsey threw me out,
I lost my job, started drinking heavily...

and I just found out
I have a lump on my groin.

Bad place for a lump.

- Tell me a good place.
- Somebody else's groin.

Touché.

Boy, you make one mistake
and you pay for it the rest of your life.

You only did the babysitter once?

No, that was two years, morning, noon
and night, but I count it as one mistake.

Maybe that's where he got the lump.

Did somebody order a pizza?

Hey, it's my favorite pizza boy.

I'm 38 years old.
I have high blood pressure...

and alimony payments.
- You got a lump on your groin?

- No.
- Then don't complain.

So, what are you doing here?

Having a lonely drink
in memory of our hopes and dreams...

that are now dead and buried.

Ah.

I'm in.

If it's all the same to you,
I'm gonna stay with Mom for a while.

Come on, Jake, I know it's been a little
rocky lately but things will work out.

Yeah, well, when they do, call me.

- Hey, Mom.
- What are you doing here?

What is he doing here?

He wasn't getting along
with Lyndsey's son.

Maybe because Lyndsey's son
is a degenerate pothead.

He's not so bad.
He's just made some bad choices.

So did his mom.

Yeah, well, you made
the same bad choice she did.

Ha-ha.

So Alan's like, I don't know,
5, 6 years old...

and I walk in his bedroom
and he's in there with the dog.

And I start yelling, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, no. Are you crazy? Stop that."

And he says, "What?"

I say, "Alan, the dog is supposed
to lick the peanut butter off you."

To this day I can't eat peanut butter.

- Hello?
- Hey, we were just talking about you.

- All good I hope.
- Oh, yeah, it was good.

- So, what's going on?
- Just having a drink with a few friends.

Chris, I believe
you know my brother.

The man who's banging your wife
and burned down your house.

Hi.

Pull up a chair...

have a drink with your girlfriend's ex
and your wife's new husband.

I just brought the pizza. I don't think
I've slept with anyone you know.

Okay.

Hey, you know what I just realized?

You three guys
have all slept with each other.

- What?
- With all due respect, Charlie...

I think I'd remember that.

No, no, no, think about it. They say that
when you have sex with someone...

you're basically having sex with
everyone they've ever had sex with.

Oh. Then I guess you and I have done
the dirty deed.

Because of Judith,
not the peanut-butter dog.

- You told them?
- I tell everybody.

Wait. So Herb has slept with Alan...

and Alan has slept with Chris,
which means that...

I've slept with Lyndsey.

Yes.

- Hello?
- How could you sleep with Herb?

Alan, is that you? Who's Herb?
Where are you?

I'm in our house.

What are you doing there?

Because there's nowhere else for me
to go because you won't forgive me.

Why won't you forgive me?

- You're drunk.
- Yeah, well, you farted at me.

Goodbye, Alan.

Where's Jake?

He left hours ago
to get away from you.

- Where's Alan?
- He left to get away from me.

Where's what's-his-name?
The guy who owns the house?

He left to get away from all of us.

Hey, this is working out
pretty good, huh?

You know, I envy you guys.

You've all been married, have kids.

Yeah, it didn't end well,
but for a moment in time...

each and every one of you experienced
what it is to have a family.

To give and receive
unconditional love.

My marriage isn't over.

Dude, you've been taking out
the garbage for two and a half hours.

I said it wasn't over,
I didn't say it was good.

Really, Charlie, you envy us?

Oh, come on, look at me.
What do I have?

A big house on the beach, more
money than I know what to do with...

and a cell phone full of candid video
of me having uninhibited sex...

with beautiful women whose names
I don't remember.

I don't think he envies us at all.

Good catch, Herb.

I gotta go pee.

- Oh, uh, bathroom's right back there.
- I know where it is, I used to live here.

Right, right.

That's a classy guy.

Using the toilet in a house
with no plumbing.

- Where have you been going?
- Refrigerator.

I filled the vegetable crisper.

See, that's what I love about you,
Charlie. You're a maverick.

I gotta start being
more "maverickyky."

Herb, where the hell are you?

Maybe tomorrow.

Hey, Lyndsey, you'll never guess
what we figured out about you and me.

Herb!

See you soon.

Alan, let's go home.

- You came to get me?
- Yeah.

- You forgive me?
- Well, I thought about it and...

Hey, Lyndsey.

Chris? What are you doing here?

Well, I came to see the damage
and I just started thinking about us.

What an idiot I was.

You were, you know.

- I'd give anything to start over.
- Really?

Uh, excuse me, but weren't you about
to forgive me?

Can we go out some place
and have a cup of coffee...

and, maybe, just talk?

Babysitter.

Well, I guess there's nothing wrong
with talking.

That's great. I can't tell you how much
I've missed you and Eldridge.

He really needs a father, Chris.

Uh, so I'll see you
back at the house, right?

She left her kid there,
she's gotta come back.

Would you come back for that kid?

She's never coming back.

You know who
you remind me of, Alan?

- Job.
- Job from the Bible?

How many Jobs you know?

Job. The guy God punishes
just for laughs.

God punishes Job to test his faith.

Still funny.

- Ugh. What time is it?
- A little after midnight.

So much for that 30-minute guarantee.

Goodnight, fellas.

- Goodnight, Gordon.
- Goodnight, Gordon.

So I guess it's just you and me, huh?

Two guys sitting alone
in a burned-out house.

Hey, Silent Betty. You made it.

See you, Alan.

Sure, half and half sounds good.

Huh.

Maybe I am like Job.

But I am not gonna lose my faith.

Crap.

.......... ********** ..........

Alrighty. Here we go.

Thirty-eight dollars and 41 cents
for school pictures.

Thanks.

- You forgot to sign it.
- No... Did I?

Oh, silly me. Ha, ha.

Um, "Alan Jerome Harper, D.C."

District of Columbia?

Doctor of Chiropractic.

You know, not everyone
can use those letters after his name.

Congratulations. Give me the check.

You put the wrong date.

- Oh, did I?
- Yeah. See? It's for next month.

Ah, don't worry about that.
That's just for bookkeeping purposes.

This isn't like the check you gave me
for the field trip to Catalina?

- Hey, that was the bank's mistake.
- The teacher made me...

stay on the boat while everyone else
went swimming with dolphins.

Dolphins carry disease, Jake.

Alan Harper, D.I.C.

- You're welcome.
- You're cheap.

I'm not cheap, I'm broke.
There's a difference.

He was cheap
long before he was broke.

If you knew what I'd done on that table,
you wouldn't put your face on it.

I don't get it. I'm a good guy,
I try to do the right thing...

and I have nothing to show for it.

You still grinding on the fact
that you finally met a great gal...

moved in with her,
had a house you could call your own...

then burned it down
along with all your possessions...

and watched her run off with her ex?

Was it necessary
to list the entire fiasco?

I enjoy the occasional recap.

- But look at the bright side.
- What bright side?

I just got a big residual check,
and I'm heading to Vegas.

Oh, my God. Do you have any idea
how long it would take me to earn that?

Oh, don't think like that.

You're never gonna earn
that kind of money.

- Seriously, table.
- Oh!

Okay, I know I give you a hard time...

but it makes me feel horrible
watching you go through this.

- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

Stop watching you.

I'm starting to feel better already.

Table.

- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Bye.

Oh, Zippy.
I can't stand seeing you like this.

You going to Vegas too?

I wish.

You know, I've been where you are.

What did you do on the table?

No, I've been down and out.

I've lost everything. Didn't know
where my next meal was coming from.

- Really?
- Felt like I was all alone in the world.

No friends. Nobody who gave a damn
whether I lived or died.

What'd you do?

Well, first thing I did
was pick myself up, dust myself off...

and rat out
my ex-boyfriend to the feds.

You're kidding.

Got a 2500-dollar reward...

from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

Took that and invested in a pallet
of counterfeit Jordache jeans.

Set up a booth at the Rose Bowl
swap meet. Made a killing.

- Really?
- Took those profits...

and opened up a little doughnut shop
across the street from a police station.

Can't miss, right?

Turns out,
cops don't like paying for doughnuts.

Lost my ass.

Had to go to work cleaning toilets
for strangers.

What's the point of this story?

I just wanted you to know
I've had a colorful past.

Good night.

It was a hell of a story.

Jake, I'm gonna take a nap.

Ow.

Egyptian cotton.

Might as well take a nap in style
for a change.

Oh, yeah.

No wonder he can have so much sex.
The mattress does half the work.

Oh, hello.

New TV.

Remote. Remote. Where is the remote?

Poor Charlie.

Went to Vegas
and forgot his hooker money.

Oh, here we go.

What the hell?

You sick bastard.

Hmm.

This would be terrific with a woman.

Ugh. My ass cannot be that big.

Who's your daddy?

Who's your daddy?

Unfortunately, you are.

Hey, buddy.
What are you doing up here?

You're on the TV downstairs.

Yes, well,
there's a very good explanation for that.

- I'm listening.
- It never happened.

Understood, Daddy.

This is Charlie Harper
in the garden suite.

I'm gonna need a couple more pillows
and some ice.

Thank you.

Okay.

This is nice.

Quiet. Private.

Come on in.

Mr. Harper?

Call me Charlie.

All right, Charlie.

Call me Kendra.

Can I call you Nurse Kendra?

If you like.

Oh, I like.

I gotta tell you, I'm a little nervous.
I've never done anything like this.

Oh, a newbie.

Well, don't worry, you're in good hands.

- Is it gonna hurt?
- Maybe a little soreness afterwards.

Some bruising.

Well, I guess
that's what I'm paying for, right?

Hello, Mr. Harper.
Welcome to the Schenkman Clinic.

We have you down for an eye lift
and a neck tuck in the morning.

- That's correct.
- Is there anything else you'd like done?

Little lipo? Nose job?
Penis enlargement?

No, no, no, thanks.

For the record, I got a penis enlargement
when you walked in the room.

Thank you.

Do you have any questions? Concerns?

I don't think so.
I wanna make sure I look natural...

like I haven't had any work done.
- Don't worry. My work is undetectable.

In fact, you might be surprised to learn
that Kendra is a 62-year-old black man.

I'm kidding. But those boobs?
Those are Schenkman's.

I'm not sure I want my eyes
to pop out like that.

- You're gonna look great. See you.
- Thanks you, doc.

Anything else you need?

I think I'm okay.

Wait, wait, wait. There is one thing.

No, you can't see them.

Then I'm good.

Jake, your mom's here.

Hey.

Well, I guess it was probably inevitable.

What? Oh, the clothes.

Well, as you know,
most of mine burned up in the fire...

and Charlie's in Vegas,
so I figured, why not?

Because you look like an idiot.

- Hey, Mom.
- Bye, buddy.

Get help.

Wish I could afford it.

Oh, man, my life is pathetic.

On the other hand...

Charlie's life is great.

Bartender, drinks for everybody.

Just house brands.

Hi. Charlie Harper.

Wow, a house on the beach.
That's awesome, Charlie.

I suppose it must seem that way.
You'd think driving around town...

in a big, brand-new Mercedes
would also be pretty awesome...

And it is.

- But at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter...

how much stuff you have.
What matters is what's in here.

What is in here?

Oh, pff, More cash.

How about that? Ha, ha.

And you got all that
just by writing jingles?

I know. Not even a real job.

What can I say?
You know, some of us are very lucky.

Very, very, very lucky.

Charlie?

Yeah, Charlie.

I mean, yeah, pff, Charlie, pff.

- You wanna get out of here?
- Wow, where'd that come from?

- I thought we were getting along.
- No, I mean together.

- Some place quiet?
- Oh, yes. Yes, by all means.

Let's go somewhere quiet.

Uh, bartender, thank you
for taking such good care of us.

Here you go. One, two, $3.

Give one of those to the waitress.
So where would you like to go?

How about your beach house?

Great idea.

Yeah, why go to Denny's or Applebee's
when you have your own beach house?

- Come, let us Mercedes to the beach.
- Okay.

This is so easy.

Charlie?

Mom?

- Sweet Jesus.
- Surprise.

What happened to you?
What are you doing here?

Since I referred you to Dr. Schenkman...

he was kind enough to offer me
a free chemical peel.

When this heals,
I will have the face of a 12-year-old girl.

Yeah, but from the neck down,
you'll still be an Egyptian mummy.

Oh, hush. I just stopped by
to wish you luck tomorrow.

Well, thanks.
Wait. Why would I need luck?

Oh. No reason.

That 60 Minutes report on
Dr. Schenkman was entirely one-sided.

Much like that poor woman's vagina.

Sleep well.

Yeah, like I'm gonna sleep at all.

- Welcome to the casa del Charlie. Heh.
- Wow.

What a beautiful beach house.

Yes. Yes, it is. Beach is out there,
and just past it, the ocean.

- Keep going, and you hit Hawaii.
- Oh.

Then Japan. Ha, ha.

And I guess
this is where you write all your jingles?

Yup, this is where the magic happens.

Play me something.

Oh, gosh.

I'd rather not.

Please? For me?

Well, if you insist. Ha-ha-ha.

Uh, here is a little song
you might remember by...

the immortal...

Mr. Billy Joel.

Harry Truman, Doris Day

Red China, Johnnie Ray
South Pacific, Walter Winchell

Joe DiMaggio, ho!

Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon
Studebaker, television

Marilyn Monroe

We didn't start the fire

It was always burning
Since the world's been turning

We didn't start the fire

No we didn't light it
But we tried to fight it

We didn't start the fire

You're very talented.

No, no, no. Billy Joel was very talented.

I'm just a piano man.

- I only have one question.
- What's that?

How long are you gonna pretend
to be Charlie Harper?

Sing us a song, you're the piano man

Oh, please, just give it a rest.

How'd you know?

I've been with Charlie.

I've been in this house.

Well, color me embarrassed.

So...

who are you?

All right. All right. Here's the truth.

My real name is Derek...

Brick...

house.

- Derek Brickhouse.
- Yeah, try again.

All right. My name is Alan.

I'm Charlie's brother.
I live on his foldout couch.

- I'm sorry. I'll drive you back.
- Hang on.

I didn't say I wanted to go.

Oh, no, but I thought
it was kind of implied.

- I'm having a good time. Aren't you?
- Well, not now.

I was, when I was Charlie.

And Billy Joel.

- Who else do you like to be?
- What do you mean?

I think role playing is kind of a turn-on.

- No kidding.
- Yeah.

That's why I came back here with you.

Makes some guys nervous.
Your brother hated it.

Well, I am not my brother. Ha-ha-ha.

As you so adroitly pointed out.

Come on.

Oh, boy, ha, ha, role playing.

Can I be the man?

- Are you serious?
- Well, I've had a bad run lately.

Mr. Harper.

Mr. Harper.

How are you feeling?

Okay. How'd it go?

It went great.

And the doctor decided
to give you a bonus.

Check them out.

Oh, no, no. I didn't ask for these.

- But you haven't even seen them yet.
- I don't wanna see them.

Hang on.

You know, this could work.

Gretchen, what exactly
was the role playing...

that freaked Charlie out so much?

Hang on. You'll see.

I'm glad you're not as uptight as he is.

Well, as you know,
I am capable of bending the rules...

and going with the flow...

What you think, schweinhund?

Not a deal breaker.

Honey, I'm home.

In the kitchen.

Kids okay?

How's the Beaver?

Everybody's fine. How was Vegas?

You know, the usual.

- How was your weekend?
- Pretty good.

I met a girl.

Did her name happen to be Gretchen?

- That's indelible marker, you know.
- I know.

- It'll come off in a few weeks.
- I figured.

Does she still have her little mustache?

You know, down at the Russian front.

I wouldn't know what she's got.
I was blindfolded and hog-tied.

Right. Right, right.

- Why are you wearing sunglasses?
- No reason.

Why don't you take them off?

Okay, fine. You might as well know.

Bar fight.

Oh, no. What happened?

Some bikers were giving a stripper
a hard time, so I jumped in.

- You're kidding.
- You know me.

I can't stand to see a naked,
high-heeled, glitter-covered...

Ping-Pong-ball-shooting woman
in distress.

Wow, that sounds very brave.

- Good for you.
- Thank you.

- Uh, Charlie?
- Yeah?

Uh, if you're gonna go with that story...

ask Mom to stop telling people
you had your eyes done.

Damn.

The mummy strikes again.

You know, it's actually not a bad look.

Shame one guy
had to ruin it for everybody.

.......... ********** ..........

Gee, that's too bad, Jake.
A sore throat and a runny nose?

Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess you should
stay at your mom's this weekend.

Yeah. Yeah, feel better. Okay, bye-bye.

- Jake's sick?
- No, he's lying.

Probably has a party to go to
or something.

- Or a hangover.
- Mm.

Remember when he wanted
to be around?

Remember when we
wanted to be around him?

Hey, that's my son you're talking about.
But point taken.

You're free for the weekend.
What are your plans?

I don't know. Uh, just catch up on
my reading, take a walk on the beach.

You know, a little me time.
What about you?

Pretty much the same.
Except instead of reading and walking...

I'm going on a date hoping to get laid.

Now, uh, when you say date,
do you mean an actual date...

or one of your $2500
"date experiences"?

If I were paying $2500,
I wouldn't just be hoping to get laid.

Mm.

So you're back in the dating game.

How'd you hook up? Was it a meet cute?

- Meet cute?
- You know, like, uh... Like in the movies.

She's carrying groceries and
you bump into her and she spills them.

You try to help her pick them up
and you bonk heads.

She's concerned she might
have a concussion.

You tell her you're a doctor and keep up
the ruse until she's fallen in love.

At which point you confess
that you're not.

And she's furious
and never wants to talk to you.

You go to her place of work
and make a complete fool of yourself...

by declaring your love for her
during an important business meeting.

Thankfully the meeting is with Japanese
bankers who find you charming.

And they give her the big account after
which you scoop her into your arms...

and ask her to marry you,
and you live happily ever after.

In Portland.

Um, no.

She's a dermatologist who scooped
a precancerous mole off my ass.

Oh. Well, that's cute too.

What's her name? How old is she?

Her name is Michelle
and I'm guessing mid-30s.

Oh, almost age appropriate.

Oh! If I took a picture of a strange wart
on my toe...

would you show it to her
and ask if it's normal?

Sure, I'll pull it out over dinner.

Come on. She's a dermatologist
and I have a hideous growth on my foot.

The hideous growth on your foot is you.

You know what? I'll e-mail you a jpeg.
You'll know when the moment is right.

- Hey, Alan. Listen...
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

Right. Having a little me time.

Wasn't little until you came in.

- What do you want?
- In case I get lucky...

and this girl comes back,
make yourself scarce.

- No problem.
- I don't wanna see you or your wart.

- Got it.
- Good.

Oh, try MalibuPuddingGirls. Com.

- Pudding girls?
- Trust me.

MalibuPuddingGirls. Com.

Oh. Yikes.

- Right here?
- That's great.

How's your tush?

Fine. How are your boobs?

I meant, how is it feeling
since I took the mole off?

- Oh. A little tender, but still functional.
- That's good.

- It's not fair, though.
- What?

You've seen mine, I haven't seen yours.

That's true, isn't it? We're going to have
to figure out a way for you to get even.

- Okay, show me your ass.
- You're terrible.

How are you at those trivia questions?

Well, let's see.

"Which TV shows jump-started
these movie stars' film careers?"

Okay.

"George Clooney." ER.

Nice.

"Leonardo DiCaprio." Growing Pains.

- I didn't know that.
- Oh, yeah, the last season.

"John Travolta."

Um...

Welcome Back, Kotter.

- Good memory.
- How could I forget?

It was my favorite show in high school.

You mean it was your favorite show
set in high school, right?

Oh, no, no. In 10th grade
I had a giant crush on Travolta.

But wasn't that show on in,
like, the '70s?

Yeah.

So you were in high school in the '70s?

Uh-huh.

Were you like really, really smart
and skipped a bunch of grades?

Uh-uh.

I'm 47, Charlie.

Oh, okay.
I wasn't even thinking about that.

Really? What were you thinking about?

Uh...

You know, the Scientology thing
with Travolta and Cruise.

- What's that all about?
- How old are you?

You know how old I am.
I filled it out on my form.

You are not 36 Charlie.
Even your mole was older than that.

Did I write 36?

I meant 40.

Two.

Three.

So I'm out with a younger man.

Sexy.

Yeah. Cool.

Do you want to come in
for some coffee?

Oh, gee, I'd love to, but, um...

But what?

This isn't something I normally say
on a first date...

but my left ass cheek is throbbing.

Oh, you poor baby.
Do you want me to take a look at it?

No, no, that would just be a pity peek.

I'm... I'm... I'm sure it's fine,
but I... I should go.

Okay. I suppose you'll call me...

if you want to get together again.
- Absolutely, I will.

Goodnight.

- You've got my number, right?
- Indeed I do.

Forty-seven.

- Hey. Hey. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- Alan, again?
- It's not what it looks like.

Hey, I get it. You're bored, you're lonely.

You can't afford a hooker.
But come on, keep it in your room.

Okay, in my defense,
I wasn't expecting you home till later.

Plus, it felt a little naughtier out here.
You know, in public.

You want naughty? Go yank it on
the pitcher's mound at Dodger Stadium.

Oh, clever. Ha, ha.
Seventh inning stretch.

You realize
I now have to burn the couch.

Well, if you're gonna do that, you might
wanna burn the deck chair too.

Oh, God, Alan.

- So how was your evening?
- Fine.

I thought you were
bringing her back here.

And yet, you were twanging
your magic clanger...

right in the middle of the living room.

I lost track of time. Sue me.
So, what went wrong with your date?

Nothing went wrong. She's terrific,
she's beautiful, she's smart.

- But?
- She's 47.

- You said she was in her mid-30s.
- That's what I thought.

Apparently dermatologists know how
to take really good care of their skin.

Or she's a witch.

I don't understand. You liked her when
you thought she was 35. What changed?

I found out she's 47.

- Oh, come on, 47's just a number.
- A big number. A scary number.

Are you really that superficial,
vain and shallow?

Yes, yes and yes.

The deepest thing about me...

is a little pit on my ass
where a mole used to be.

- But fish can swim in shallow water.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

I don't know, I'm a little dehydrated.

What I'm trying to say
is that it's silly to throw away...

a promising relationship
based on an arbitrary number.

It's not arbitrary. She's really 47.

Forty-seven!
That's like 10 years older than me.

Why do you do that?

I'm your brother.
I know exactly how old you are.

The minute I found out she was older, I
started looking at her in a different way.

- And what way is that?
- Like she's a woman who...

when I'm 52, she'll be 60.
- You'll be 56.

What are you, the math police?

- You know what this is about, don't you?
- Yeah, when I'm 58, she'll be 70.

- You're really gonna keep doing this?
- I can't help myself.

Look at it this way. When she's 70...

you're likely to have been dead
for 10 years.

Actually that does
make me feel a little better.

I'll tell you one thing, Charlie.

I would give anything
to find someone I enjoy being with...

who's close to my own age
and who I can really connect with.

Look no further, Alan.

You've found her.

You do get me, don't you?

I gotta be honest with you, I didn't think
I was ever gonna hear from you again.

- Why would you think that?
- I don't know, the age thing.

Oh, come on, that's just a number.

I like you, I'm attracted to you.

Plus, there's no way
anybody looks at you and thinks:

- "This is a 47-year-old woman."
- Thank you.

- We're only as old as we feel, right?
- Right.

So I say, for all intents and purposes,
you and I are a couple of 35 year olds.

Agreed. We're 35.

Hey, Mom.

That's my daughter.
For all intents and purposes, she's 8.

Shauna, this is Charlie.

Sorry to interrupt. I came to pick up
my snowboard stuff.

- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

- I'm going to Mammoth for a few days.
- With?

- What do you care?
- I'm your mother.

- Should I go?
- No, no. It's fine.

- Who are you going with?
- His name's Jeremy. You happy?

- Jeremy? What happened to Sarah?
- Sarah and I broke up.

- Sarah?
- When were you gonna tell?

Mom, I'm 20 years old, my personal
life is none of your business.

- Twenty?
- As long as you're my daughter...

it's my business.
Tell me about Jeremy.

What's to tell? He's a nice guy.
He's Sarah's roommate.

Wait, you broke up with Sarah so
you could hook up with her roommate?

No, no, we were all hooking up together.

But then Sarah got all weird,
even though it was her idea.

Don't you just hate that?

The three of you had sex together?

You said I should
explore all my options in life.

I was talking about grad school,
not threesomes.

- I'm so sorry you have to hear this.
- No, it's fine. Pretend I'm not here.

- I need to borrow money.
- How do you expect to pay me back?

I still have a job.

A webcam in your bathroom
and a PayPal account is not a job.

I admit it's not making much money.

But that's because
there's so much free porn.

She's got a point.

The whole pay-to-peek industry is dying.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

And if I could just throw in
my two cents here.

Your daughter's at that time in her life
where she's gotta make her own choices.

Doesn't matter if they're right or wrong.
Either way she learns.

- But I'm just trying to protect her.
- You can't protect her.

All you can do is love her
and be there for her no matter what.

I am there for her. You know that, right?

Yeah, I do.

Come here.

- What?
- I should go.

- Oh, no, no. It's okay.
- Really, I gotta go.

Have this time with your daughter.

- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. I'll call you tomorrow.

- Nice to meet you, Shauna.
- Nice to meet you too.

It's wrong, it's wrong, it's so wrong.

Oh, what the hell?

Let's try ShaunaShower. Com.

- Oh, for God's sake!
- Hey, hey...! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- It's not what it looks like.
- Well, that's a relief.

It looks like you were masturbating
to mariachi music in your car.

What do you want? I only get AM radio.

- Alan?
- In here.

Is it safe?

Yes.

We cool here?

Yes. Relax.

You do realize
you have a serious problem.

- It's not my fault.
- Really? Whose fault is it?

Big pharma.

Who the hell's big pharma?

You know, pharmaceutical companies
that make boner pills that last 36 hours.

- You took a boner pill?
- I had to. The pills were about to expire.

But you didn't have a woman.

Hence the constant masturbation.

You know how expensive
those things are.

I'm simply trying
to get my money's worth.

So this non-stop whack-a-thon
is just because you're cheap?

And horny.

- And nuts.
- Semantics.

- Why the car?
- You said not in the living room.

Did I say "in the car"?

Well, I didn't plan it. I... I was gonna go
to the movies and I got distracted.

What could possibly distract you
from driving out of the garage?

Think about it.
Slipping the key into the hole.

Gently turning it, pumping the gas
until the engine starts purring.

I'm thinking about it
and I'm still going with nuts.

Unlike you, I did not have female
companionship tonight.

- Well, as it turns out, neither did I.
- Hmm. What happened?

You really expect me
to share my personal problems...

with a self-abusing zoo monkey?

Who else you got?

Right, here's the deal.

I went back determined
to take the age thing off the table.

Good for you. Very mature.

It was great until her daughter walks in.

- She has a daughter?
- Not just a daughter, Alan.

A 20-year-old daughter.
A gorgeous daughter.

A bisexual daughter.

Summing up: A 20-year-old,
gorgeous, bisexual daughter.

Got it. What did you do?

- What could I? I got the hell out of there.
- Why?

What do you mean, why? You know me.

If I continue a relationship
with Michelle...

at some point I'm gonna try
to nail her daughter.

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.

But as sure as your speedometer could
use a Handi-Wipe, it will happen.

- So you're breaking up with Michelle?
- I have to.

Then you hit on the daughter?

No, no. No. I'm getting away
from both of them.

It's better to hurt Michelle a little now
than a lot later.

Oh. Well, color me impressed.

You're making a decision
that's considerate and selfless.

Putting aside, of course, the fact
that the motivation for the decision...

is sordid and despicable.
- Thank you.

Seriously though,
the daughter is unbelievable.

She has some kind of porn site
on the Internet.

Really?

Apparently there's a webcam
in her bathroom.

Can you imagine a 20-year-old co-ed...

in the shower, with her girlfriend,
soaping each other up?

Something to ponder.

Excuse me.

Actually, not a bad idea.

Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- Oh, jeez, Zippy.
- What are you doing with the pudding?

Well, I guess I appreciate your honesty.

It wouldn't be fair
to start a relationship with you...

knowing I'm still not over Chelsea.

No, it's understandable.
She was your fiancée.

I've tried to stop thinking about her,
and I can't.

I like you too much
to risk our relationship...

being some kind of a rebound thing.
- All right.

- I guess I just have to accept that.
- Thank you.

Bye.

You know what, Jeremy?
Just go to hell, you're a childish jerk.

Oh, hey.

You okay?

I guess. I just thought this guy
was something he's not.

Well, he's young, you know,
women mature faster than boys.

That is so true.

Have you considered
dating someone a little older?

I tried that once, it was disgusting.

- Really?
- The guy was almost 35.

It was like
sleeping with my grandfather.

- No kidding.
- He could only do it twice in a row...

before he needed to take a nap.

Uh-huh.

Excuse me.

Hey, Michelle, good news.
I think I'm over Chelsea.

Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!

It's not what it looks like.

So you feel like going again?

Sure. I just need, you know,
a little nap first.

Oh, jeez, Charlie. What are you gonna
be like when you're my age?

- Ouch.
- I'm kidding. Come here.

Hang on.

What do you want, Alan?

Arrested? For what? Oh, Alan.

What was the movie?

You're right, it doesn't matter.
Okay, I'm on my way.

- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

.......... ********** ..........

Swordfish looks good.

You eat a lot of fish.
Aren't you worried about mercury?

Michelle, on the list of things
I expect to kill me...

mercury poisoning
ranks well below liver failure...

struck by lightning
and heart attack during sex.

Guess which I'm rooting for.

Is that Charles?

Speaking of things I expect to kill me.

What a lovely surprise.

This is my mother Evelyn.
Mom, Michelle.

It's a pleasure.
You have a wonderful son.

Yes, I do. But Charlie and Alan
must never learn of him.

Before she kills, she likes to torture.

So how did you two meet?

Charlie asked me to look at his butt.

Oh, smooth, Charlie.

She's a dermatologist, Mom.

Oh, a doctor?

You have access to Charlie's medical
records and still went out with him.

Nice to see you.
I don't wanna keep you...

from whatever schmuck
you're here to meet.

Sorry I'm late, Mom.

How about that?
The poorest schmuck I know.

Michelle, this is my brother Alan.
Alan, Michelle.

- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

Would you like to join us?

- Sure. Heh.
- How sweet.

- Waiter?
- I thought you liked me.

Well, this is very pleasant.

The last time I met Charlie's girlfriend I
was picking glitter off my skin for a week.

Oh, right,
the, uh, 22-year-old pole dancer?

Oh! Don't get the wrong idea.

I mean, not every woman
Charlie dates is a stripper.

I can't imagine you stripping,
for example.

I mean, I can imagine it.

So, what's the occasion for you two?

No occasion.
Can't a son invite his mom to lunch?

- He needs money.
- No, no.

If you're looking to give
I'm not gonna turn it down.

You're a dermatologist.
How do I get rid of a 170-pound skin tag?

Excuse me, 164.

Really?
That's the part you object to?

You like to be called a
200-pound drunk?

- One-eighty.
- See?

Yeah, well, better a lush than a leech.

At least a leech doesn't miss
his mother's birthday in a blackout.

But when the lush wakes up...

he can buy her a nice gift
with his own money.

He can, but he doesn't.

- You wouldn't appreciate it.
- Let's not start with appreciation.

Did I ever get a thank you for bearing
you and raising you all by myself?

Thank you, Mommy.

Give it a rest. I'll write you a check.

Thank you, Mommy.

Do you have children, Michelle?

- I have a daughter.
- Isn't that nice.

She ripped your heart out yet?

- Not quite.
- Well, give her time.

Children are God's little way
of punishing us for having sex.

So, Michelle,
you've met my mom and my brother.

You breaking up with me now,
or prefer to wait till after lunch?

I'll wait. I already ordered the soufflé
and I understand it's very good here.

Oh, she's attractive,
successful and funny.

So tell me, dear, why are you settling?

Um, wait, wait, wait.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

Have there been
a lot of women in this bed?

Uh...

Actually in the bed?

Fewer than you'd think.

- Charlie.
- Listen...

I'm not gonna lie about who I am
or where I've been.

Don't ask unless
you really wanna know.

It doesn't matter.

- The past is the past.
- Agreed.

- Let's work on the present.
- Oh, goodie, I love presents.

Uncle Charlie?

Busy, Jake.

Oh, is Chelsea back?

- No, Jake.
- Mia?

No.

- The married stripper?
- Uh, what's her name? Betsy?

- What do you need, Jake?
- Can I borrow your car?

No, you can't borrow
my hundred thousand dollar Mercedes.

Okay.

- Sorry about that.
- It's not another hooker, is it?

Excuse me.

- Here's the keys. Go away.
- Thank you.

My nephew. Everyone's convinced
he's a freaking moron...

but I'm starting to think
he's an evil genius.

- Hey, did you hear that noise last night?
- What noise?

Around 2 or 3:00 in the morning,
I thought I heard a man crying.

Oh, that's nothing. That's just Alan.

- It's nothing?
- Yeah.

He gets up
in the middle of the night to pee...

then he can't get back to sleep,
so he masturbates.

Then he starts crying.

Oh, my God, that's awful.

It's like the ocean.
I don't even hear it anymore.

Hey, sorry I'm late. I stopped off
and did the shopping for the week.

This is my housekeeper Berta.
Berta, Michelle.

- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

- Planning a party?
- Every afternoon at 2.

She's kidding. Right, Berta?

Huh? Yeah. Sure, why not?

Can I go and make your bed or are you
just catching your breath and rinsing off?

It's fine.
We're gonna walk on the beach.

Ha-ha-ha. Good one.

Why is that funny?

Last time this one was on the beach
is because he fell off the deck.

It wasn't his fault. He was drunk.

I'll go make your bed.

She seems nice.

You think?
She scares the crap out of me.

- Well, why don't you get rid of her?
- Oh, no, no, no.

No, I could never fire her,
I love her to death.

Interesting.

So you love her
and yet she scares you?

Little window into old Charlie, huh?

More like a garage door.

Well, you've met my family...

you know all about my past,
my fondness for...

things I'm fond of.

- Uh-huh.
- So why are you still here?

Come on, Charlie, I'm a realist.
Nobody our age comes without baggage.

Well, yeah, but some people might
think that my baggage is extra icky.

- Extra icky?
- That's actually a quote...

from a former girlfriend.

Well, I think that a mature
relationship...

has got to be
based on honesty about our flaws.

- You know my flaws.
- Openness about our past.

You know my past.

And a willingness to forgive.

I forgive you.

I really like you.

I really like you too.

Hi, Charlie.

There might be one more thing
you should know.

Rose, this is not a good time.

I just want to talk. Sorry, Michelle,
this will only take a minute.

- Do I know you?
- Nope.

Seriously, Rose, not now.

How do you kno...?
How does she know my name?

- Long story.
- Well, not really.

Once you have a plate number
the rest is cake.

Could you give us a minute?

No, she's not going anywhere.

Charlie, who is this woman?

- Just a friend.
- Oh, I'm more than a friend. We dated.

- Just once, eight years ago.
- You haven't seen her in eight years?

- Well, no, no, no. Not exactly.
- We stay in touch.

- You stalk me.
- Oh, please.

Does a stalker babysit his nephew?

Does a stalker sleep with his brother?

Does a stalker's dad
sleep with his mother...

who you met at lunch the other day?

Have you been following me?

Not you.

Okay, I'm a little freaked out here.
I'm gonna go home.

What? Why?

Nice officially meeting you.

Oh, come on, don't go.
I'll get rid of her.

No, no, no. No.
Clearly you have lots to talk about.

But what about all that stuff you said?
Baggage, willingness to forgive?

- Obviously I was wrong.
- Michelle.

No. Look, I could deal...

with your mother, brother,
nephew, housekeeper...

- Yeah, I know...
- No, no, no. I'm not done.

Your drinking, your gambling,
womanizing...

but I am not
putting up with your stalker.

Really?
That's where you draw the line?

Seems a little arbitrary.

Goodbye, Charlie.

I like her. She's feisty.

That's it, Rose. This is the last straw.

Really?
That's where you draw the line?

I really care about this woman.

- I'm glad for you.
- No, you're not. You never are.

You do everything to come between
me and any woman I'm serious about.

- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- Of course that's what I think.

You just did it.

You've been doing it for eight years
and I'm sick of it.

Now get out.

Okay, but you should know that
I didn't come over to ruin your date.

- Really. Why did you come over?
- To tell you that I'm getting married.

I'm not marrying you, Rose.

Not you, silly. Manfred.

Manfred?

He's wonderful.
I can't wait for you to meet.

Uh-huh. Have you met him yet?

You don't believe me?

Of course I don't believe you.

All you've ever done
is manipulate and deceive me.

Fair point.

But I am getting married.

I wanted to let you know
before you heard it somewhere.

Where else would I hear it?

Society page
of The Crazy Bitch Gazette?

Clearly it was a mistake coming over.

No idea the news
would hit you this hard.

Yeah, I'm bowled over.

I'm devastated,
I can't imagine life without you.

Goodbye.

Last chance to kiss the bride.

What?

I'm not sure how to get home
from this side of the house.

Hey, Michelle, it's me again.

Sorry for all the messages.

Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. Ha, ha.

Anyway, again I am really sorry
for all the craziness last night...

but like you pointed out,
everybody's got baggage.

Unfortunately, one piece of mine
needs to be sedated and institutionalized.

Okay. Call me. Kisses.

Kisses?

If I was any fruitier,
I could open a Jamba Juice.

Check it out. Rose's engagement
announcement is in the paper.

"Manfred Quinn"?

Says he's an important figure
in the fashion industry.

No, I still don't buy it.

- What do you mean? It's in the paper.
- Oh, grow up.

Do you have any idea how many times
I printed my obituary?

Why would you do that?

Lots of reasons. Gambling debts...

angry husbands,
sometimes just to get a little me time.

Real or fake,
I'm a little miffed I wasn't invited.

How do you get invited
to a fake wedding, Alan?

With a fake invitation.

Obviously.

How come Rose only shows up
when I'm in a good relationship?

Where was she when I was dating
the manic depressive Satanist.

Or that chick with all the knives?

Don't forget the pre-op life guard.

Post-op. She was post-op.

Really?

I could've sworn I saw a bulge
in that bikini bottom.

The point is, it's like Rose
has some kind of...

sixth sense where she knows
I'm about to be happy.

Not a sixth sense. She follows you
and watches your every move.

All we know, the house is bugged
and she's listening now.

Hi, Rose.

Yeah, well, if she is...

she overplayed her hand this time.

I'm not falling for this wedding crap.

But just in case,
shouldn't we get her a gift?

- What?
- They're having a sale...

at Williams-Sonoma.
Wanna go halvsies on a pepper mill?

- I'm not going halvsies.
- Okay.

Okay. How about
a ceramic cow-shaped creamer...

handmade
by the Pennsylvania Dutch?

- No gifts.
- Why not?

Because there's no wedding.

There's no wedding.

You do what you want, Charlie.

But I, Alan Harper, am gonna
get Rose something really nice.

Ooh, a set of faux walnut napkin rings,
only 9.95.

Add to cart. Heh.

- Surprise.
- Not really.

You called like 11 times.

- These are for you.
- Thank you.

It doesn't change anything.

Oh, come on, Michelle.

I can't help it
if some one-night stand...

from years ago
is still obsessed with me.

It's not about her, Charlie.
It's about you.

Okay, I can't help it if I'm so wonderful
that she's still obsessed with me.

- That's not what I meant.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

The fact you have
a relationship with her...

after all this time tells me
you have feelings for her.

Okay, okay. Maybe we have developed
some sort of friendship...

but that doesn't change
that on a very primal level...

the woman scares the hell out of me.
- Listen to yourself.

What you said about your housekeeper.
You love her, but you're scared of her.

Having met your mother,
I'm betting you're scared of her.

Well, yeah, but I don't love her.

Charlie.

What are you trying to say?
I'm in love with Rose?

You tell me.

Bye, Charlie.

Okay, I do love Berta.

I suppose I kind of love my mother.

Oh, crap.

So today's the big day, huh?

- What big day?
- Rose's wedding.

Oh, please, there's no wedding.

- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

- But what if you're wrong?
- What do you mean?

I mean, would it make
a difference to you...

knowing that cute little face will never
pop up over that railing again?

That the one woman who's always
loved you and been there for you...

is forever out of reach?

- Come on.
- Where are we going?

To the church. I'm gonna prove
she's not getting married.

Okay.

Aren't we a little under-dressed?

There's no wedding.

Last chance to go halvsies
on the napkin rings.

There's no wedding.

Only cost you 50 bucks.

You see? No wedding.

You got x-ray vision?

Come on, I'll show you.

Just a heads up...

if there's no wedding,
you're getting napkin rings for Christmas.

Go ahead, Alan, look.

Tell me if you see a wedding.

- I see a wedding.
- What?

The two persons present
now come to be joined.

Rose and Manfred,
we are here to remember...

My God.

She's really doing it.

Rose is getting married.

It's not too late to stop it.

Don't be ridiculous.

It's way too late.

Okay, $25 to split the gift,
and I'm losing money.

This man and this woman should not
be joined in holy matrimony...

let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

And we're clear.

Yep, that ought to do it.

Thanks, Freddy.

My pleasure. I guess.

Unbelievable.

Rose is actually married.

Mrs. Manfred Quinn.

I see it now.

I love her.

I've always loved her.

I'm sorry.

It's true what they say, Alan.

You don't know what you've got
till it's gone.

You've still got me.

You're not who they had in mind
when they said it.

I'll always love you, Rose.

Mrs. Manny Quinn.

.......... ********** ..........

So I'm confused.

Is Edward the gay vampire
or the gay werewolf?

The vampire.

And he's not gay, he's androgynous.

So he can write with both hands.
Big deal.

No, I mean... Never mind.

I'll tell you what's a great movie.

Jackass Two.

I know what you're thinking,
sequels suck. But not that.

One part where this guy puts on
a diver's helmet with a hose.

And this fat guy farts into the tube
until he pukes.

The guy in the diver's helmet,
not the fat guy.

- Sounds puerile.
- Oh, yeah, it's totally puerile.

Unless puerile isn't good.

In which case, it's totally unpuerile.

Anti-puerile?

Maybe we shouldn't talk.

Hello.

- Crap.
- Is that your dad?

No. Worse. My drunken uncle.

I just pray he remembered
to pull up his zipper.

There's my main man...

Jake-a-roonie, Jake-a-reenie,
Jake the snake.

- Who are you?
- Megan.

Meg-a-roonie, Meg-a-reenie,
Megan the snagan.

- Zipper, Uncle Charlie.
- Good catch.

- I thought you had a date tonight.
- Not a date.

A date experience.

- What's the difference?
- About $1500.

So, Megan, what's your deal?

Trying to teach your parents a lesson?

- I'm in Jake's homeroom.
- Got it.

Yeah, I was pretty sure you didn't
meet him in Honors Math class.

Boy, I remember being your age,
going out with Beth Anderson.

She was head cheerleader.

I was crazy about her,
but she dumped me and left me...

with nothing but a broken heart.

And the clap.

The what?

Wow, you kids today have no idea
what that is, do you?

I know it sounds cute. The clap.

But it burns like hell.

I think I'd better get home.

Wait, don't go.
He'll be passed out in 10 minutes.

- I'll see you in homeroom.
- Come on, Megan.

Thanks a lot.

You're welcome.

- I'm really gonna get you back for this.
- Okey-dokey.

Megan, hold up.

Oh, Beth Anderson.

Every time it hurts when I pee,
I think of you.

Charlie.

- What?
- Sign this.

I'm not signing anything
till I see a lawyer.

- Wake up.
- What?

Birthday card for Mom. Sign it.

No, thanks.

Come back with a
do-not-resuscitate form and we'll talk.

Come on, Charlie.

- What'd we get her?
- You mean, what did I get her?

No. I mean, what did I pay for?

We went 50-50 on engraved stationery.

Fifty-fifty?

Okay, a hundred-zero...

but I will pay you back.
- Right.

I assume you don't want to give her her
present and wish her happy birthday.

And I assume
you're never gonna pay me back.

We are a well-oiled machine.

"Mom, you know how I feel.
Charlie."

Straight from the heart.

- This just blows.
- Come on.

Seeing you is gonna
make your grandmother very happy.

What do you two want?

Hi, Mom. Happy birthday.

Happy birthday.

We bought you a gift.

Doesn't give you license
to show up unannounced, but all right.

She just better keep me in the will.

- I can hear you, Jake.
- Love you, Grandma.

Just so you know, I like this even less
than you do.

That's hard to believe.

I gotta tell you, Mom,
you are looking younger every year.

Uh-huh.

I hope you lie to your parents
better than that.

I do.

I don't.

- So, uh, do you like your present?
- It's stationery with a big E on it.

- It stands for "Evelyn."
- Very good, darling.

Uncle Charlie said the E was for "evil."

So any big birthday plans?

- Like what?
- I don't know. Hot date?

I did have a date.

- What happened?
- He cancelled.

You got dumped on your birthday?

That's so puerile.

Or is it?

What is wrong with him?

Nothing organic.
We've had him checked.

So is there birthday cake?

Oh, Jake, what is to become of you?

Thank God
my life is mostly behind me.

I'd hate to be your age...

preparing to make my way in a world
that's coming apart at the seams...

while having no discernible job skills
or charisma whatsoever.

So is that a yea or nay on the cake?

Bye, Mom. Happy birthday.

That was grim.

Yeah, who has a birthday party
without cake?

Your uncle really dodged a bullet.

Yeah, he did.

Hey, Dad, maybe
we shouldn't leave Grandma alone.

She seemed kind of depressed.

Oh, uh, don't worry.

She doesn't commit suicide,
she inspires it.

Maybe it'd be nice to have her to Uncle
Charlie's for a real birthday dinner.

You know, Jake, it's moments like this
that make me proud.

You've got a big heart.

We'll bring her back
to Uncle Charlie's.

- Hey.
- Hey.

How was your time in hell?

So good he brought a little back
with him.

Hey... Hey, Mom, happy birthday.

I would've come over, but...

Oh, come on,
do I really need a reason?

That's all right.
I don't expect much from you...

and you never disappoint me.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to
drown my sorrows in alcohol.

If you're not committed to alcohol,
there's ocean out there.

What are you doing?

I thought it'd be nice
if we had a birthday dinner.

You thought it'd be nice
to invite Mom?

Actually, it was Jake's idea.

Of course.

Jake.

And where is the boy?

Sunday.
I dropped him off at his Mom's.

Hey, Uncle Charlie. How's it going?

You rat bastard.

Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

Bye.

What did he mean,
"payback's a bitch"?

Damn it, Charlie, how am I supposed
to make a martini without green olives?

He misspoke.
He meant "the bitch is payback."

So this is it? We're just gonna sit here
watching television till dinnertime?

I'm hoping to do it till bedtime.

We can't talk?

- What would you like to talk about?
- Don't encourage her.

What comes immediately to mind
is the futility of love...

the disappointment of family
and the inevitability of death.

I'd be with you if "inevitable"
meant now.

I am sorry, but I cannot go along
with you two gloomy Guses.

I look at life
and I see the cup as half full.

But the cup belongs to your brother,
and what it's half full of is tears.

- Good one, Mom.
- You're no one to talk.

He at least aspires to normalcy.

Tries to have meaningful relationships
with women.

You go out with a girl and break up...

before her hoo-ha can develop
a five o'clock shadow.

Well, in his defense, Mom,
he's usually paying by the hour.

Very smart, Alan.
Bite the syphilitic hand that feeds you.

Well, if neither of you is going to
refill my drink, I'll do it myself.

Help yourself, Mom.

I keep the vodka in a bleach bottle.

- I gotta get out of here.
- You're gonna leave me alone with her?

Hey, I was alone with her for two years
before you were born. You owe me.

- Why don't we both make a break for it?
- Okay. Great.

On three.

One.

Two...

You're supposed to say "go"
after three.

Before we pick up the olives,
can we stop at a pharmacy?

Sure.

Isn't anybody gonna ask why?

Fine. Why?

Don't ask if you don't care.

It's a woman problem.

- Enough said.
- As you get older...

certain parts of your body
don't lubricate properly.

Please, God, tell me you have to
pick up some Visine.

I'm not talking about my eyes, Charlie.

Oh, sure, one can masturbate
to keep things flowing...

but it's not the same
as actual intercourse.

What's his problem?

Just give him a minute.

That was very rude leaving us
sitting there on the side of the road.

Would you rather I threw up
in the car?

- Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, hey, Russell.

My mother, Evelyn. My brother, Alan.

- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

Can I interest you folks
in a codeine popsicle?

It's my own invention.

I think we're good.

You suck on one of these,
you'll be great.

I call it "springtime on a stick."

Yeah, listen, my mom needs some...

Mom?

Birth control pills.

Do you have a prescription?

Kidding, we're all friends here.

Come on back
and I'll show you our selection.

Well, aren't you a doll?

And I'm anatomically correct.

Good to know.

Why'd she ask for birth control pills?

Gee, I don't know. Maybe she didn't
wanna lead with her dry hoo-ha.

- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yes. But this time be clear.

- Do we run on "go" or just "three"?
- No, no, there's no running.

Let's set her up with Russell.

- Gee. I'm not sure that's a good match.
- When did this become eHarmony?

- We just need to get her out of our hair.
- Right, right.

- Follow my lead.
- Thanks, Russell, these'll be just fine.

- What do I owe you?
- Oh, it's on the house.

Any mom of Charlie's
is a potential lifelong customer of mine.

Aren't you sweet?

Or it could just be
Mr. Popsicle talking.

Russell, uh, we're having
a birthday dinner for Mom tonight.

If you're not doing anything,
maybe you'd like to join us.

- What a wonderful idea.
- I'd love to.

What can I bring? Xanax, Ritalin?

- What are you serving?
- Chinese takeout.

Then perhaps something
from the opiate family?

- Bring whatever you want.
- Done and done.

And I will see you later, birthday girl.

I'll see you later,
anatomically correct boy.

- So around 7?
- With bells on.

- Thanks for the invite.
- You're welcome.

You poor clueless bastard.

I don't know why I didn't think of this
years ago. Russell's perfect for Mom.

They've both been divorced
multiple times...

they're both trying to hang on
to their youth...

plus they're both big fans
of class A narcotics.

Does Russell have kids?

None that he admits to.

Just like Mom.

Well, boys, what do you think?

Wow, you look terrific.

- It's not too much, is it?
- No, no, no.

The bright colors are good for Russell.
It keeps him from nodding off.

I want you both to know
how grateful I am...

for everything you've done
to make this a special birthday for me.

- You're welcome.
- Want to make you happy.

Thank you, but if you wanted
to make me happy...

you would've made
different life choices.

- That's him.
- Hang on.

All right, open the door.

Russell. Russell!

- Oh! Hi, Charlie. This is Jill.
- Hi, Jill.

- Come on in.
- Thanks.

What's with the date?

Well, you said bring whatever I want.
I want her.

- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

To put on panties.

So, what do you do for a living, Jill?

Well, I'm an actress,
but you know how it is.

Once you turn 30, parts dry up.

You think your parts are drying up now,
wait till you turn 50.

Ah, don't worry, sweetie.
By the time you're 50, I'll be dead.

So how long have you two
been dating?

We're not dating.
We have an arrangement.

Arrangement?

Let him climb on top of me a couple
of times a month, and he pays my rent.

Four glorious months and counting.

Russell, mind helping me
make margaritas?

Oh, it'd be my pleasure.

You know what's good on the rim
of a margarita?

- Salt?
- Pharmaceutical cocaine.

It's actually good around the rim
of anything.

I'm only gonna ask this once.

What did you think I meant when I invited
you to a dinner for my single mother?

I don't know.

When you came into the store, I was
higher than Mel Gibson on Passover.

I cannot believe you actually walked
in here with a smoking-hot 30-year-old.

What's hard to believe?

She's an out-of-work actress,
and I have money and drugs.

I guess this isn't exactly
the birthday party you were hoping for.

No, no, what every woman dreams of
is her sons fixing her up with a man...

who arrives with a young,
hot arrangement.

Well, if it makes you feel any better,
when he touches me, I wanna vomit.

It actually does, thank you.

It's funny you should say that.

Um, my first wife, Judith,
towards the end of our marriage...

used to make this face
like she was gagging.

Sort of a...

No one cares, Alan.

Now, Jill, listen to me.

You still have time to make changes
in your life.

You don't want to end up
old, used-up and alone like me.

I'm always here for you, Mom.

Like I said, make changes.

Okay, another margarita
for the birthday chiquita.

Oh, hit me.

Uh, Evelyn, I believe I owe you
an apology.

When Charlie invited me to dinner,
I had no idea that he was thinking...

that you and I were
a potential couple.

I mean, you're a handsome woman...

but my tastes run more
to baby veal.

I understand. She's veal and I'm jerky.

Good, so you get it.

Excuse me.

Wow, that could've been awkward.

One of us should probably
go talk to her.

I'll go talk to her.

I can't believe I'm hitting that.

I can't believe I'm not hitting you.

Wait, wait. You're opening
a drug rehab facility in Malibu?

No. Not rehab. Prehab.

- What the hell is that?
- Prehab?

All right. Think about it.

Rich celebrities will spend
$50,000 a month...

to go someplace nice
where they won't do drugs.

Imagine how much
they would spend...

to go to a snazzy place on the beach
to do them.

- What about the legal issues?
- What are you, a cop?

- No.
- Then shut up.

Hey, is it me, or have Mom and Jill
been gone for quite a while?

Time is a very subjective thing,
Charlie.

Especially when you're abusing
powerful antipsychotics.

One of us should probably go check
and see if everything's okay.

One of us should probably answer
that phone first.

Mom?

- That tickles.
- You started it.

- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Jill.

Oh, Evelyn.

On three?

You wait till three.

I can't believe Mom ran off
with this idiot's girlfriend.

I can't believe this idiot's still here.

It's not that I can't hear you.

It's that I'm busy talking
to Jim Morrison.

Incredible.

Excuse me a minute, Jim.

I don't wanna spook you fellas,
but I took a handful of Viagra...

in anticipation of
a different kind of evening.

Three.

What are you looking at?

.......... ********** ..........

Yeah, hi. I'm watching
your commercial for the Shake Weight.

Yeah, I gotta tell you...

my brother does basically the
same thing in the shower every day...

and he has absolutely
no muscle tone in his arms.

- All right, I'm out of here.
- Hold on a sec.

What does this look like to you, Berta?

Your brother in the shower?

You hear that? It's not just me.

Thanks, Berta. I'll see you tomorrow.

No, you won't.

I told you, I'm going to a family reunion
for a few days.

But what about me?

All right, let's go through this
one more time.

I arranged to have a friend
fill in for me.

Her name is Esmerelda.

I have given her
detailed instructions...

about how you like things done
around here.

Did you tell her to roll me over
on my stomach...

so I don't choke on my own vomit?

That's number one on the list.

- Is she hot?
- She was in the '70s.

I guess it's better that way. Yeah.

Yeah, it's tough enough
that you and I have sexual tension.

Oh, by the way,
you promised me vacation pay.

Okay.

How much did we agree on?

That looks about right.

- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

- Uncle Charlie in there?
- Yep.

- Drunk?
- Hammered.

- Did you clean him out?
- Would I do that to my little buddy?

Thank you, Berta.

Your muscles expand and...

- Have a good weekend, Uncle Charlie.
- Enjoy your family reunion.

- What?
- What?

You owe me for that pizza
from the other night.

Oh, yeah, sorry.

- How much was it?
- That'll do it.

Jake, let's go. Your mom's outside.

- See you, Uncle Charlie.
- See you, buddy.

Thanks for the pizza.

- When did you guys have pizza?
- I have no idea.

- Hey, Charlie, you remember Lyndsey?
- Nope.

Hey, look.

I'm exercising.

Oh. Maybe you ought to sit down
for a minute.

Good idea. I'm getting a little dizzy.

- I hope I don't have a heart problem.
- No, you have a drinking problem.

Well, that's a relief.

So who's this Lyndsey?

You remember. Lyndsey.
Early 40s, blond, pretty?

No recollection.

I burned her house down, she left me
and went back to her ex-husband?

Keep going.

Nice, full, very natural-looking C cup?

- Oh, right, Lyndsey.
- Here we go.

- What are you doing?
- Childproofing you.

Thank you.

So you're dating Lindsay Lohan?

No, no, Lyndsey Makelroy.

Anyway, she called, and things
aren't working out with the ex-husband.

And though she didn't say
she wanted to get back together...

I am gonna meet her for dinner.
- Well, that's great.

- Mm-hm.
- Good for you.

How do I look?

Like Lance Armstrong
after a three-day drunk.

- Nice.
- Mm.

You are a good brother, Alan.

Have some money.

Thanks.

If I were really a good
brother, I'd stage an intervention.

Thanks for the pizza.

Eureka.

I've invented the drinking helmet.

Hello?

Man, did I go to Tijuana last night?

Me, you, not married, are we?

I guess if the answer was yes,
she wouldn't be polishing the piano.

- Hey, Alan, quick question.
- Yeah?

Who is that in our living room?

- That's Esmerelda.
- Gonna need more.

- Berta's friend.
- Keep going.

Berta went to her family reunion.
Esmerelda's filling in.

Oh.

Would've been nice
if she'd given me a heads-up.

- Aren't you gonna ask about last night?
- Oh, yeah.

What did I do last night?

Somehow I spent
almost all my money.

No, I meant what I did last night.

Oh. No.

Lyndsey wants to get back together.

- C cups.
- Right, Lyndsey.

She did split up
with her ex-husband, Chris.

Said she realized
she didn't wanna go backwards.

In what universe is dating you
not going backwards?

I know.
This guy must be some kind of mess.

Breakfast, Señor Harper?

Why is she saying breakfast?
Am I supposed to make her breakfast?

She'll make it for you.

Mm. Try the huevos rancheros.
They're amazing. Uh...

Where did you learn
to speak Spanish?

Junior high, high school, college...

two years of chiropractic school
in Mexico.

You say that
like I'm supposed to know.

You are supposed to know.
You're my brother.

Oh, no, no.

Mm-hm.

What's so funny?
Are you talking about me?

She says she likes your hat.

Alan, come here, quick!

Please, God, don't let it be a dead girl.

What is it?

Open my door
and tell me what you see.

Why? What do you see?

Just look.

- Are the flying monkeys back?
- Don't joke about that, Alan.

Wow.

- Esmerelda did this?
- Can you believe it?

The fresh-cut flowers,
the carafe of lemon water.

- She laid out my slippers.
- Since when do you have slippers?

I don't know.
Is it possible she made them?

- She put a chocolate on your pillow?
- Yep.

See what it says?

"Felicidad."

- That means "merry Christmas," right?
- It means "happiness."

You sure? What about that song
"Felicidad Navidas"?

"Feliz Navidad"?

Tomato, tamale.

The point is,
Esmerelda is a terrific housekeeper.

I didn't get a chocolate.

- You're not Señor Harper.
- I'm a Señor Harper.

Yes, but you're not the Señor Harper
that pays her.

Come on, you gotta see this.

Still could've given me a chocolate.
How much could it cost?

Look.

That's not a swan. That's my towel.

- Nice touch.
- Had me fooled at first.

I tried to kill it.

And look, she folded my toilet paper
into a little point.

After breakfast I used some,
stood up, shaved...

and when I looked back,
I swear it was pointed again.

- Is that a votive candle?
- Yep.

She's praying
I have pleasant bowel movements.

- Oh, please.
- No, no, no, it's working.

This morning, soft, firm, easy-peasy.

But wait, there's more. Come on.

- Ta-da.
- She bought you a new grill?

No, no, this is the old grill.
You know what she did?

- What?
- She cleaned it.

She cleaned the grill?
Berta never cleans the grill.

Tell me about it. She only comes out
on the deck to smoke pot.

Señor Harper.

- Yes?
- She's talking to me, Baba Louie. Yes?

Hell, yeah, botanas.

- What's that mean? "Screw you"?
- Basically.

Ha, ha. I love this woman.

Esmerelda, te amo.

- Thought you didn't speak Spanish.
- I don't.

I know how to say "I love you"...

and "how much for a happy ending?"
In like 17 languages.

You're kidding.

In case you ever wanna have
a good time in Central Africa.

- Alan, get that.
- Esmerelda's giving me a pedicure.

Pedicure? I can't even get
a freaking chocolate.

Hello, Alan.

Chris. Hey. Uh, what brings you by?

Lyndsey mentioned
you two were dating again.

I wanted to let you know that if
I had to lose her, I'm glad it was to you.

Thank you.
How'd you get my address?

Not important.
Here, I brought you a little gift.

Okay. Ha, ha.

- Nothing in here's gonna bite me, is it?
- Ha-ha-ha. Open it.

Oh.

Look at that.
It's a picture of Lyndsey and you.

Yeah, look how happy we were.
We just found out she was pregnant.

It looks like she's glowing,
but it's lights...

from the Ferris wheel
on the Santa Monica Pier.

- I can't accept this.
- Oh, I want you to have it.

You need to see how happy Lyndsey
made me so you can be that happy.

Okay, I'm not quite sure
I follow the logic, but thank you.

See you around.

Ah, it's too late, Alan.
You're already dead.

Well, that was a bit disturbing.

Hey, one decaf Grande soy chai latte
with extra whipped cream.

- And a black coffee for the lady.
- Thank you.

- I don't know how you drink that stuff.
- Back at you.

- Name?
- Alan.

What's so important that you didn't
wanna talk about it on the phone?

It's not that it's important,
it's just that it's...

If you dragged me here
to break up with me, I will murder you.

Oh, no, no, no. Nobody's breaking up.

But speaking of murder,
I saw your ex-husband yesterday.

I'm sorry, "speaking of murder"?

Oh, oh. Maybe I should back up a little.

Chris showed up at my house...

and handed me what I consider to be
a very inappropriate photo of you two.

That bastard. He told me
he threw those pictures away.

Okay, I don't think we're talking
about the same pictures.

But the point is,
before he left, he shot at me.

He shot at you?

Not with a gun, with his finger.
But the implication was pretty clear.

Okay, let me get this straight.
I wasn't naked in the picture?

No, you were at the Santa Monica Pier.

But not naked, right?

Right. But my concern here is that your
ex-husband seems to be threatening me.

Oh, Chris is harmless.
His bark is way worse than his bite.

- So you're saying he does bite?
- Alan, you have nothing to worry about.

And if it'll make you feel better,
I'll talk to Chris.

- Talk to me about what?
- What the hell?!

- How long have you been sitting there?
- I just got here.

I was gonna say hi,
but thought it was a little creepy.

- Ex-husband, new boyfriend.
- Are you following us?

No, I just stopped in
to have a cup of coffee.

- You live on the other side of town.
- But I like the coffee here.

Okay, I don't know what you're trying
to accomplish, but it needs to stop now.

Uh, I've got this, Lyndsey.

Now...

listen up, pal.

I'm dating your ex-wife,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

Do you understand me?

Police! Police!

Calm down.

- Chris, get out of here.
- I'm leaving.

- Oh, Alan?
- What?

See you around.

- See? See? He shot me again.
- Calm down.

Calm down? This guy is crazy.
We need a restraining order.

- I don't think that's necessary.
- Of course it's necessary.

This is unacceptable behavior.
I am not putting up with it.

Forget the restraining order.

I'm gonna pay him a visit and make it
clear he's messing with the wrong guy.

- Alan?
- Aah! Police! Police!

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Breakfast time.
Esmerelda's huevos rancher...

Whoa. Berta.

- Hey.
- I thought you were at a family reunion.

Came home early.
Turns out I don't like my family.

So you came back. Yay.

So Esmerelda's not coming in
anymore?

No, I called her.

She didn't mess things up too bad,
did she?

No, no, no. I mean, she's not you,
so there was a little adjustment.

What's that you're eating?

- Western omelet.
- Oh.

- Looks good.
- It is.

Which reminds me, you're out of eggs.

- Charlie?
- In here.

Staring at me while I eat
is making me very uncomfortable.

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Charlie, I've got a problem.

How about that?
The problem's got a problem.

Berta's back. Yay.

I'm going somewhere
I can eat in peace.

I thought my family was annoying.

- Can you believe it? Esmerelda's gone.
- Yeah, boohoo.

Lyndsey's ex-husband
threatened to kill me.

How is that a bigger problem than me
having to make my own breakfast?

I'm serious. He's crazy.

Of course he's crazy.
He's an ex-husband.

The words go together.
"Crazy ex-husband."

- I'm an ex-husband.
- There you go.

What're we gonna do about Esmerelda?
It's not like I can fire Berta.

Sure, you can.
Frankly, I never cared for the woman.

What am I gonna do?
I don't wanna lose Lyndsey. I love her.

And I love huevos rancheros
and chocolate felicidadas on my pillow.

Okay, we seem to be talking
at cross-purposes here.

Because you're not focusing
on the real issue.

I've just lost the best housekeeper
since Wilma Flintstone.

What the hell?

- What was that?
- A rock. Oh.

It's gotta be Chris.

- How can you be sure?
- Who else would throw a rock at me?

Good point.
I'm here and Mom's out of town.

I ain't cleaning that up.

Hello?

Hello?

Up, up and away in my beautiful balloon

Hello?

Hello?

Okay, whoever this is, you should know
that you're not scaring me...

Esmerelda. Come on in.

Yeah, yeah, me too.

Esmerelda?

Charlie, what's going on?

Excusez-moi.

From now on,
Berta will be our day housekeeper...

and Esmerelda will be our
night housekeeper, capiche?

- Does Berta know?
- Berta doesn't need to know.

Um, so, what's she gonna think...

when she sees pointed toilet paper
and swan towels?

Way ahead of you. I'll just unswan and
unpoint everything before she gets here.

Then why do it?

Is it worth the trouble
to sneak around behind Berta's back?

I know it's crazy...

but the woman makes me happy.

Botanas, Señor Harper?

Oh, sí... vous plaît.

How about that?
I'm starting to pick up the language.

It's a shame the language is French.

Alan, relax. If Chris wanted to kill you,
he'd climb through your window...

while you're sleeping
and smother you with a pillow.

Thank you, that's very helpful.

At least
that's how I always imagined doing it.

You rat bastard.

Berta.

- It's not what it looks like.
- Is that so? Then what is it?

Uh...

It's purely sexual.

I'm not stupid, Charlie.
I know when I'm being two-timed.

Charlie, I'm shocked. Shocked.

Berta, I had no idea this was going...

- Stay out of it, Zippy.
- I'm out.

- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I am so sorry. I got carried away.

I think if we all sit down like adults and
talk this through, we can make it work.

Uh-uh. It's either me or her.

Oh, please don't make me choose, Berta.
I love you both.

- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

It's you, Berta. It's always been you.

I'm sorry. It's just not our time.

Please tell her how sorry I am.

Adiós, Señor Harper.

Arrivederci, Esmerelda.

Okay, then, I'll see you tomorrow.

Good, good.

- I'll be late.
- That's okay.

You might wanna clean that hair up
off the floor before I get in.

- Sure, I'm on it.
- Okay.

Oh, Esmerelda.

No.

No, I can't let her go.

Oh, hey, Chris. Pillow's on the couch.
Alan's in his room. Esmerelda!

.......... ********** ..........

I've been looking forward to this
all year:

Giving you people the bird.

Looks great, Berta.
What's your secret?

I bought it pre-cooked
from the back of a truck.

I don't know
that I'd trust the stuffing.

I'd like to make
a little Thanksgiving toast.

You don't hear me say it often...

but I really am thankful
for every one of you.

I've never heard you say that.
You ever hear him say that?

I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

Anyway, there comes a time
in a man's life...

when he realizes there's nothing
more important than family.

Is he dying?

Probably just drunk.

And you know why
family's so important?

- Designated driver?
- Liver match?

- Bail money?
- Prescription medication to steal?

Would you please let me continue?

Family is important
because no matter what happens...

they are the people
who are there for you.

Good times, bad times,
it doesn't matter.

Blood is thicker than water.

I just want you to know
that I love you all.

I'll get that.

Plowed.

Hi, stranger.

Courtney?
I thought you were in prison.

I was, but I'm out.

Wanna go to Vegas?

You crazy? I'm in the middle
of Thanksgiving dinner with my family.

Last time we were together
you kind of ripped me off.

I haven't had sex in three years.

Goodbye, everybody.

Viva Las Vegas

Chucka, chucka, chucka

Viva Las Vegas

Chucka, chucka, chucka

Viva, viva Las Vegas

Hey, Alan, guess where we've been.

Las Vegas?

Viva.

I won $20,000.

- And look what he bought me.
- Wow.

Thirty grand.

So you're down $10,000?

I won a bundle at the roulette table
betting the color of her underwear.

Red or black?

Double zero.

What color is that?

Ass cheeks.

Hey, what happened to your eye?

- Oh, ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

Yeah, little accident.

We were getting kind of frisky in the tub
and I fell face first onto a Jacuzzi nozzle.

Me too, except it wasn't my face
and it wasn't an accident.

Good news is we're both really clean.

Inside and out.

Shall we go upstairs
and get dirty again?

- Right behind you.
- What else is new?

- Um... Uh, Charlie?
- I'll be up in a minute.

The trick is to keep it up.

- What?
- I'm just a little concerned...

Oh, I almost forgot.

- I got you a little something.
- Oh, you didn't have to.

Here you go.

You can't just buy those.
You gotta have them specially made.

Makes more sense
for me to be wearing it.

- Charlie, hold on.
- Ahh. Now what?

Do you think it's a good idea
to be starting back in with Courtney?

- I just had the best three days of my life.
- Okay, but it just seems...

Have you ever had a woman
give you Japanese rain goggles?

I've never even heard of that.

Neither had I until last night, and now
I don't know how I lived without them.

I'm saying,
we're talking about a convicted felon...

who seems to have
expensive tastes.

Yeah, what's your point?

You don't care about anything else...

as long as you get to indulge
your depraved appetites?

Still waiting for a point, Alan.

Jake, wanna go to a movie?

Jake?

What are you doing?

Resting.

I guess you're wondering
what's going on up there.

Not really.

Well, I just want you to know there's
more to it than what you're hearing now.

I know.
They've been going at it all afternoon.

No. What I mean is...

A couple of times
I thought somebody was gonna die.

What I'm trying to say is...

I didn't know human beings
could make those sounds.

Okay, what I'm saying is...

there's more to a healthy,
fulfilling relationship than sex.

- Oh, yeah, baby, right there.
- That's what I'm talking about.

Like, uh, mutual responsibility,
mutual respect.

I'm a slut, I'm a dirty little slut.

Taking care of each other.

Now do the rain goggles.

Sharing things.

Arigato.

- Dad?
- Yeah?

Get out.

Good talk.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Dean Martin and the Golddigger
keep you up again last night?

He's lost his mind, Berta.

All he does is have sex
and spend money on her.

Sometimes he spends money on her
while he's having sex.

How's that?

I picked up the phone...

and accidently overheard
a very disturbing call to QVC.

Pearl necklace. I'll say no more.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Morning.
- Nice shirt.

It's not too subtle, is it?

Something wrong with your arm?

I'm not sure.

I think I pinched a nerve last night
reaching around...

trying to scratch Courtney's back.

- Her back?
- Trying to be delicate here, Alan.

And God knows we appreciate it.

Good morning, everyone.

- Morning.
- Morning, baby.

Hmm.

- Car keys?
- Ah.

Credit card?

- Kiss? See you.
- Mwah.

Have fun.

"Have fun"?

You gave her the keys to your Mercedes
and an unlimited credit card.

Yeah, so? That's fun.

Can't you see she's using you?

You should have seen
the way she used me last night.

In fact, you can.

Oh, no, no.

No, I don't...

I just don't wanna see you
get played by her again.

Relax, I know what I'm doing.

I'm having fun, she's having fun,
nobody's getting hurt.

You have a black eye and a dead arm.

Obviously, we have different definitions
of fun.

What is wrong with him?

Classic case of vajayjay fever.

Colorfully put. I'm just surprised
to see Charlie fall for it.

Sooner or later, all men fall for it.

How do you think I got my condo
in Palm Springs?

You have a condo in Palm Springs?

No, figure of speech.
Don't try to stop by.

You caught me at a bad time, darling,
I was just going out.

- Well, I'm sorry, but I have a problem.
- Just the one?

It's about Charlie.

Sweetheart, you have been
sponging off him for eight years.

You've got to expect a little abuse.

No, it's not that.
I'm worried about Charlie and Courtney.

I really think
she's taking advantage of him.

Uh-huh. What are you worried about?

Well, I just said,
Charlie could lose everything.

Oh, I see.
Well, I understand your concern.

- Thank you.
- It's not like you could move in here.

Oh, no, no,
I'm not just worried about me...

Wait, you used to beg me
to move in with Jake.

That's when Jake was cute
and I still had a bit of hope left for you.

- Okay, well, anyway...
- Alan, your brother is a grown man.

I'm sure he can take care of himself.

I'm not sure. You should see
the way she's sucking him dry.

I should hope so.

- Mom.
- Alan.

There's not much you can do...

when a grasping, greedy woman
sinks her claws into a vulnerable man.

Marty, I'm leaving.

Come kiss me goodbye.

Come here, hot stuff.
Give me some tongue.

Marty, my son Alan is here.

- You've met Alan.
- The fruit bowl?

No tongue for you.

Cupcake, I need your credit card.

The usual place.

Oh, you bad boy.

Dig a little deeper.

There's a hole in this pocket.

Ha, ha. Keep going.

Surprise.

Well, how nice for you,
but I got to run.

Oh, damn, I worked on it all morning.

You know what? I'll just go.
Nice to see you, Mr. Pepper.

Mr. Pepper was my father.

Just call me
"the guy banging your mother."

I think I'll stick with Mr. Pepper.
Bye, Mom.

Bye, dear.

Anything you need before I go?

Yes. Uh...

Check my pocket again.

Hey, boys.

- Hi.
- Hi.

What's all this stuff?

Okay, here's the red one.

What do you guys think?

Oh...

The yellow one's better, right?

I'm not sure.
What do you think, Eldridge?

I think we need to see
the yellow one again.

Okay, okay, guys, guys,
I'd like to talk to Courtney.

- Go ahead.
- Pretend we're not here.

Okay, let me put it another way.

Get out.

- Bye, Courtney.
- Bye.

- Bye, fellas.
- Thanks again for inviting me over.

Was I lying?

So, what do you want to talk about?

Uh, well, the thing is...

Are my boobs even?

Even, what?

Well, I just wanna make sure
one's not popping out...

more than the other.

Oh, no, no.
They're both, uh, popping just...

Fine.

- Great.
- Hmm.

- So?
- Huh?

What do you wanna talk about?

Oh, yeah.
I wanted to talk about Charlie.

What about him?

I don't know if you're aware...

but he went through a bad break-up,
and he may not look like it...

but he's in a vulnerable place now.

And you think
I'm taking advantage of him?

Well, aren't you?

Look,
I know what you must think of me.

Based on some of the stupid things
I've done, I don't blame you...

but, Alan, I've changed.

What about all this stuff?

He likes buying me things.
Makes him happy.

Believe me, the money is fun
but it's Charlie I care about.

- Really?
- Really.

Okay, then.
Thank you, I feel better now.

Hey, beautiful, you ready to go?

Yeah, let me just grab my purse.

Oh. Alan, James. James, Alan.

- Hey.
- Hey.

He's my brother.

He was adopted.

Yeah, I remain skeptical.

- Charlie?
- In here.

- What happened to your foot?
- Broke my toe.

- Oh, jeez.
- Serves me right.

Trying to walk around in Courtney's
high heels with one good arm.

Why were you wearing her shoes?

Because they matched
her underwear. Duh.

Okay.

Whatever.

I thought you might wanna know
that Courtney left...

with a handsome,
young African-American fellow.

Yeah, her brother James.

And you're buying that?

People have a hard time
believing you're my brother.

Including me, by the way, and Mom.

All right, I'm just gonna say this.

I don't think you should trust Courtney.
She's trouble.

Well, yeah, she's trouble,
that's why I love her.

You love her?

Of course I love her.

Courtney is the woman
I'm meant to be with.

Everything in my life up till now,
all the women...

they've been leading me to her.

I would've guessed they were leading
you more to a clinic, but go ahead.

Remember how down I was
when Chelsea dumped me?

And when Rose got married?

All of that was necessary
in order for me to get back to Courtney.

It was also necessary for Courtney
to make early parole.

Exactly, this was meant to happen.

Don't you see it, Alan?
Courtney is the kind of woman I need.

She's non-judgmental,
free-spirited, open-minded...

- Double-jointed?
- Triple.

And she can pick up a dime
with her butt cheeks.

Just do me a favor and take it slow.

Give it time before you do
something stupid that you can't undo.

Don't worry, I won't.

Good.

Oh, guess what.

While we were in Vegas, I got a tattoo.

Oh, please don't tell me
you got her name put on you.

Look.

"Get out of my house."

The tattoo is temporary,
but the sentiment is forever.

You're kidding?
Now he's broken his toe?

This relationship goes on longer,
he's gonna run out of parts.

Don't be such a sourpuss.

Courtney's a terrific girl
and Charlie's happy as a clam.

Wait a second,
you never liked Courtney.

People change. People grow.

People buy expensive gifts
for the housekeeper.

- She bought you that?
- And the purse and the sunglasses.

Ciao, bello.

That's it, I am out of here.

Fine by me.

You're nothing but a selfish
son of a bitch.

- And you're a gold digger.
- Oh. Go to hell.

I'd meet you there
but they don't take credit cards.

Problem?

She was trying to use me, Alan.

Really? I'm stunned.

I still like her.

You know what she wanted me to do?

She actually found something
you didn't want to do?

She wanted me to give her money
to pay her brother's rent.

I said, hey, I've already got one brother
leeching off me, right?

Right.

This one doesn't have a job. At least
you pretend to be a chiropractor.

Well, I have my pride.

That's it for me.
No more meaningful relationships.

I'm gonna stick with the honesty
and integrity...

of the traditional
hooker-john arrangement.

Sometimes the old ways are best.

Glad you came to your senses
about Courtney...

and I just wanna say,
I'm always here for you.

- Never doubted that.
- Thank you.

Wasn't a compliment.

My point was,
I think you've made the right decision.

- I have, haven't I?
- Of course you have.

I mean, for God's sake,
look what she did to you. Heh.

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

I gotta get her back.

- Charlie?
- No...

Charlie?

Oh, God.

Are you okay?

I'm not sure.

How bad is it?

It's fine.

I ain't cleaning that up.

You're a very lucky guy, Charlie.

I ran through a plate-glass window
and you puked in my piano.

How is that lucky?

You could have bled to death and
I could've vomited on my suede shoes.

Those are my shoes.

Which is why you're lucky.

Hey, Alan.

At the moment, I'm not in your house.

I'm going to look at this
as a wake-up call.

Good, good.

- Courtney is bad news.
- I've been telling you.

You were right, I was blind.

Hard to see the truth when
you're wearing Japanese rain goggles.

I Googled the goggles.

Charlie?

Courtney. What are you doing here?

I went back to apologize,
there was blood everywhere.

I tried every hospital trying to find you.
Are you all right?

Not really.

Um, Courtney,
I think Charlie has something to tell you.

What?

Go ahead, Charlie.

I love you, Courtney.

I love you too.

Ow, ow, ow. Don't stop.

Ow, ow, ow.

Don't stop.

.......... ********** ..........

All right,
I have turned "it" into "ziti"...

uh, with a triple letter on Z
and a double word on the I.

Plus going down, I've created "za."

- Za?
- Uh, a colloquialism for pizza.

One of five two-letter words...

newly accepted by
the National Scrabble Association.

- Unbelievable.
- You can call them if you want.

That's what we in Scrabble circles
call a two-tile takedown.

Bam-bam!

- Alan, is our limo here yet?
- Sorry, I haven't seen your limo.

Oh, 100 points. Bam-bam!

That's a gorgeous dress, Courtney.

Thanks. Charlie insisted on buying it
for me to wear tonight.

- What's the charity again?
- I don't know. Landmines. Orphans.

Landmines for orphans.

- I just wanna show you off.
- Aw.

- Well, you look great.
- Thank you.

No, no. No, there's...

Something... Something wrong.

- What?
- I don't know.

I don't know. Something's missing.

Oh. Got it.

Ta-da.

Charlie, you shouldn't have.

Well, you've done a lot of things for me
you shouldn't have.

Now you look great.

God, it's beautiful. Thank you.

- What are you guys up to tonight?
- Not much.

Just a quiet romantic evening
at home.

Loser.

Come on. That's not fair.

- No, it's my word. "Loser."
- Oh. Oh.

I should point out that you could have
used the C at the top of the board...

and made "closer."

I'll stick with loser.

Yeah? Great, we'll be right out.
Our chariot awaits.

- Have fun.
- Thanks. You too.

Do me a favor. When we get in the limo,
ask the driver to put up the partition.

You bet.

Isn't that sweet? She's gonna do
more things she shouldn't.

- Gluten-free pretzel?
- No, thanks.

Guess this isn't
much of a Saturday night date.

Alan, it's fine.
I like staying in with you.

I could probably do without
the "bam-bam!"

I just wish I could take you out
and get you things like Charlie does.

I don't need those things.

I mean, they're nice.
They're more than nice.

They're what every girl dreams of.

But let's face it.
Some dreams just have to die.

Well, I'm sorry you had to settle.

I'm not settling. I'm accepting.

So you're not rich and successful
like Charlie.

So you can't take me out in limos
and shower me in diamonds.

So there's no expensive restaurants
or beautiful dresses.

- But?
- What?

Well, I can't take you out
and I can't give you stuff, but...

But I love you.

Why?

Boy, you're just gonna
keep pushing this, aren't you?

No, no. You love me. I'm good.
Ha, ha. Let's play Scrabble.

Oh, axolotl.

Bam-bam.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Pottery Barn?

Yeah, I'm looking for ideas
for a birthday present for Lyndsey.

At the Pottery Barn?

Well, I don't have your money.

There are ways to communicate
your feelings for a woman...

besides throwing diamonds at her.
- True, but diamonds get you limo skull.

Pottery Barn won't get you dry humped
in the back of a city bus.

Charming.

So, uh, how was the charity soiree
last night?

I don't know.
We never made it out of the limo.

Do you have any idea
how bad you're making me look?

Oh, buddy, that's not me. That's genetics
and barber school haircuts.

How do you think it makes me feel
when I'm with Lyndsey...

and I have to watch you shower
Courtney with limos and diamonds?

Huh. I never thought about that.
I have a solution though.

- What's that?
- Move out.

I'd appreciate it if you didn't do
so much of that stuff in front of us.

- Again, I have a solution.
- All right, let's stipulate for the record...

that you want me to move out
and I'm not going, okay?

What is it you'd have me do?
Not enjoy the money that I earn?

Not lavish it on the people I love?

Sneak around giving gifts
to my girlfriend so you don't get hurt?

Is that something you'd consider?

- No, but I'll tell you what I will do.
- What's that?

If I come home to find you standing on
a chair with a rope around your neck...

because you can't bear
another moment of your pathetic life...

I give you my word,
I will kick the chair.

Ooh. Santa Claus bottle stopper.
Only $12.

I can get her two.

- Dad?
- Yeah.

- I need money.
- Join the club.

Seriously,
my clothes are getting too small.

I give your mother money
every month...

for the express purpose
of buying you whatever you need.

Yeah, well, that's not how she sees it.

I don't know what to tell you.
Things are tight right now.

So are my shoes.

What do you want me to do,
tap into your college fund?

I guess not.

Hang on a second.

Let's not throw that idea out
so quickly.

- What do you mean?
- Well, realistically...

do you actually see yourself
going to college?

Because if you don't, we could use that
money to buy you some new clothes.

Plus maybe some other things.

It's funny that you ask that.

I had no interest in college
until a few days ago.

What changed?

I saw this video called
Topless Coeds of the Big 10...

and I decided
I need to go to college.

You expect me to pay
$30-, $40,000 a year...

so you can meet drunk girls
who lift their shirts?

Yes, please.

- Is that a "no" on the clothes money?
- I'll talk to your mother about it.

Oh, now I'm filled with hope.

Hey, Alan, come here.

- Are you gonna make me feel worse?
- Is that even possible?

I wouldn't think so,
but you usually find a way.

- What do you want?
- Couldn't help but hear you...

trying to talk Huckleberry
out of getting an education.

Yeah, not my proudest moment.

I'm desperate to find a way to buy
Lyndsey a decent birthday present.

All right, here's what I'm gonna do.

I'll "lend" you enough
so you can buy her something nice.

How much are we talking about?

Are you kidding?
You're negotiating with me?

No, no, forget it. I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not gonna take your money.

I'm sorry, I think I might have
just had a small stroke.

I heard you say
you won't take my money.

Yeah, you heard me right.

I have to find a way to buy Lyndsey
a nice present on my own.

- It's a matter of self-respect.
- Little late for that, isn't it?

- If it was for me, I'd take your money.
- If it was for you, I wouldn't offer it.

This is my girlfriend.

If I can't do this one thing for her,
then maybe I just don't deserve her.

- Okay, what's your plan?
- I'm not sure.

But when Alan Harper
sets his mind to something...

just stand back
and watch it happen.

Yeah, right.
Cue the theme from Rocky.

Need some help?

- A little late to ask, don't you think?
- Nope.

Well, the good news is I am done.
I have accomplished my mission.

After three weeks of 16-hour days
at the office and the mall...

I've managed to earn enough money to
buy Lyndsey a beautiful birthday present.

Voila.

A matching set of
natural South Sea Island pearls.

- No kidding?
- Mm-hm.

- And you got these at the mall?
- Uh, well, in the mall parking lot.

Alan, you bought pearls
from a guy in a parking lot?

Not a guy. A Tahitian wholesaler.

Do you have any idea
what the mark-up is on these?

By eliminating the middleman,
I saved a fortune.

- You sure about that?
- Don't worry. They're real.

I have a certificate of authenticity.

The word "authentic"
doesn't have a K in it.

It's the man's second language,
Charlie.

All right, but for future reference,
the way you tell if pearls are real...

is you rub them on your teeth.

Rough, they're real.
Smooth, they're fake.

Well, fine, fine.
I will prove it to you. See?

Mm. Rough.

And oddly minty.

Oh, darn.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Hey, nice pearls.
- Found them in the garbage.

Strange some of the things
people throw away.

I also found what looked like
a half-written suicide note...

in your brother's handwriting.
- No kidding.

Should I be worried?

You mean that he won't
go through with it?

He'll be fine.
He's just having money problems.

Okay, but fair warning.
He offs himself, I ain't cleaning it up.

- Who's offing themselves?
- Nobody.

Nobody important.

Hey, I was wondering,
you going anywhere today?

Don't try to play me, knucklehead.
Just ask.

- Can I borrow your car?
- No.

- Come on.
- Dude, that's a very expensive car.

There's no way
I'm putting you behind that wheel.

- See you. I'm going shopping.
- Have fun.

Courtney, you taking
Uncle Charlie's car?

- Yeah. Why?
- Maybe I could drive you.

Save you the hassle of parking.

Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
Thanks.

See you, handsome.

Yeah, see you, handsome.

Wonderful.

I just got outsmarted by
Mr. Potato Head.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- I did a bad thing, Charlie.
- Uh-huh.

- A very bad thing.
- Sorry to hear it.

- I don't even wanna tell you about it.
- Good.

- I am so ashamed.
- Okay.

We both know you're gonna tell me,
so tell me.

In order to explain,
I have to go back a few years.

Oh, please, God, help me.

When Judith and I were still married,
but having problems...

I tried to make her happy by buying her
a really nice pair of diamond earrings.

- You could afford diamond earrings?
- No alimony, no child support.

It was a bountiful time.

Uh-huh.

I spent a fortune on them.
I wrapped them up nice...

took her to an expensive restaurant
and gave them to her over cocktails.

- And?
- She said thanks, ordered the lobster...

then filed for divorce.

At which point I moved in with you.

You're right, Alan.
That was a very bad thing.

- Oh, no, that was just the prologue.
- Oh, please, God, help me.

This afternoon,
I was at Judith's to talk to her...

about using my child support
to buy Jake new clothes.

- Yeah.
- She's against it.

We argued,
she stormed out of the room...

and left me standing there by myself
in the house I used to own.

Anyway, before I left, I figured I'd pee.

I didn't need to, but with the traffic,
it's a good defensive move...

Would you please get to it?

Almost there. Almost there.

So as I was walking
down the hallway...

I noticed that
Judith's bedroom door was open.

And I thought about
those beautiful diamond earrings...

just sitting there in her jewelry box.

And how I can't even afford
to buy my girlfriend a birthday present.

Let me guess.

You peed in her jewelry box.

Judith never even wore them, Charlie.

You stole diamonds
from your ex-wife?

Yeah.

Kudos!

I don't know how it happened.

It was like I was in a dream and
my hands belonged to someone else.

I have that same dream all the time.

Except in mine,
the hands do belong to someone else.

I'm a good man, Charlie.
I play by the rules.

- This isn't me.
- Sure it is.

You made up your mind
to get Lyndsey a nice birthday present.

The only part that isn't you
is that you succeeded.

I can't give these to Lyndsey.
They're tainted.

I have to sneak them back
into Judith's jewelry box.

- Oh, you can't do that.
- Why not?

Don't you watch TV? Every time the
crooks try to put the stolen loot back...

it always goes horribly
and hilariously wrong.

I'll just have to take that chance.

Tomorrow I'm going back to Judith's.
I'll make this right.

Suit yourself.

I don't suppose
you wanna come with me...

maybe distract her
while I put the earrings back.

Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.
What could go wrong?

- Okay, I'll do it myself.
- Don't call me for bail money.

Why? You'd give me money
to buy a present.

You're not even planning
to get away with it?

Of course, I am.

But I was also planning
to become an astronaut and a cowboy.

- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

- How was shopping?
- Oh, we had a great time.

Yeah, it was a blast.

Look, I got the same watch
Johnny Depp has.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

- You bought him all this?
- Well, he was so helpful.

Here you go, handsome.

Oh, by the way,
you got a parking ticket.

I don't want you buying stuff
for that clown on my credit card.

Why not? You buy me stuff.

- There's a difference.
- What's that?

Well, you're having sex with me
and he's just screwing me.

You okay, honey?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

Oh, of course, you are.
You've been working so hard.

Mm-hm.

- I got a little something for you.
- Oh, not tonight.

I'm dead from the waist down.

No, silly, not that. This.

- What is it?
- Open it and see.

A day of pampering
at the Beverly Glen Spa?

You get a massage, scalp treatment,
facial, mani-pedi, anything you want.

- What's the occasion?
- You're my man. You deserve it.

- Oh, boy.
- What's the matter?

Well, your birthday's on Saturday.

Alan, I told you, I don't expect
anything fancy or expensive.

- I know you don't.
- Mm.

Which is why I got you these.

- You shouldn't have.
- Tell me about it.

They must have cost a fortune.

Oh, not really. I stole them.

Oh. To my birthday girl.

Thank you, sweetie.
How do they look?

Almost as beautiful
as the woman wearing them.

Oh, Alan.

Hey, hey, hey.

Judith. Judith, Herb. Ha, ha.

Um, what a surprise.
What brings you here?

- It's our, uh, weekly "in lieu of sex" dinner.
- Herb.

Oopsie.

- Hi, Lyndsey. How have you been?
- Good, thanks. How about you?

Fine.

Alan, what is wrong with you?

Nothing.
I'm, uh, just here with my girlfriend...

having a little, uh, birthday celebration,
you know.

What are you doing?

Oh, I'm sorry. I love it
when your hair is down. It's so sexy.

He's right, it is.

- Would you like to join us for a drink?
- Great idea.

- Uh, so, Lyndsey, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

Did you get anything special?

Well, as a matter of fact...

All right, all right,
I just have to say something here.

You whine and moan
about not having enough money...

to buy decent clothes for our son...

and yet somehow there's enough
for you to go out...

and have a big fancy dinner.
- What?

Oh, are you suddenly hard of hearing
or are you just allergic to the truth?

- Oh, hey. Hold on...
- No, no, no.

This needs to be said.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

Shame, shame, shame.

Shame.

Come on, Herb. He's crazy.

Happy birthday, Lyndsey.
I love the earrings.

- Herb.
- Coming.

Can you believe
I was married to that bitch?

- Hey.
- Hey.

Where have you been?

I was, uh, dropping Jake off
at his mother's.

- How are you handling your guilt?
- Oh, you mean about the earrings?

Well, interesting thing.

It's much easier the second time.

.......... ********** ..........

I hope you don't mind,
I used your toothbrush.

No problem. Where did you use it?

Nowhere your mouth hasn't been.

- You are so beautiful.
- Thank you.

- Your hair, your eyes, it's just amazing.
- Charlie.

- And this body, it's just perfect.
- Thank you.

So why don't I wanna have sex
with you anymore?

- You don't?
- I'm sorry.

No, no, no, it's okay.
I don't wanna have sex with you either.

- Oh, thank God, I was feeling so guilty.
- Me too.

- When did you know it was over?
- Ah. About two weeks ago.

Remember? Alan took Jake to the
movies and we did it on the deck.

All I could think about was picking up
the bottle and caving in your skull.

- Were you angry with me?
- No, no, it was just a way to kill time.

You know,
fantasizing if I can get away with it.

Interesting. I fantasized about you having
a heart attack or getting hit by a bus.

That way, I wouldn't be a suspect
and people would feel sorry for me.

Smart. So when did you know?

- It was the limo, wasn't it?
- Yep.

Yeah, I can tell your attention
was wandering.

Every time I looked up,
you were somewhere else.

I was making believe
you were another woman.

Well, that doesn't necessarily mean
it's over.

I pretended you were the big blue chick
from Avatar.

It's over.

So, what do we do now?

Uh, part friends, I guess.

- I'd like that.
- It's getting kind of late.

- You're welcome to spend the night.
- Oh, that's very sweet.

But I wanna get
as far away from you as I can.

That's okay. I just got Avatar on DVD.

- So we're all good?
- Absolutely.

All right, I'll go get dressed.

You couldn't wait till I'm gone?

Didn't seem to be any point.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Online poker?

Live girl-on-girl porn.

Really? At 7 a. M?

It's not 7 a.m. In Copenhagen.

How can you tell?
There's no windows.

Me, I like to start my day
with a cup of coffee.

Instant energy and it helps me poop.

Mm-mm-mm. Somebody's having
the breakfast of champions.

They say it's the most important meal
of the day.

Please tell me Courtney isn't in your
bedroom while you're looking at this.

Courtney went home. We broke up.

Oh. And you're trying to fill the void
and mend a broken heart...

at DanishMunchers. Com.

Yeah. Something like that.

So, what happened?

Nothing happened.
It just ran its course.

Wow. That's hard to imagine.
She's so hot.

Let me tell you something, Alan, for
every gorgeous woman in the world...

there's a guy out there
who's tired of banging her.

But that guy's never me.

I gotta get out of the house.

Maybe go to the movies. Is Jake here?

Uh, no, he's having a party
over at his mom's house.

Oh, damn. Did I forget his birthday?

Oh, no, no, no.
It's just one of those teenage parties.

Uh, but for the record, his birthday was
six months ago, and you did forget it.

- Oh, man, how old was he?
- Sixteen.

Huh. No wonder he keeps asking
to borrow my car.

- I'll just go to the movies by myself.
- You want some company?

Hello?
That's why I was asking about Jake.

Good morning, ladies.

No masturbating in the kitchen.

What do you say
we go someplace a little quieter?

Hey, what you working on?

It's a jingle
for a new kids' breakfast cereal.

- Oh, cool. Can I hear it?
- I guess.

Picture this over animated
dancing monkeys and zebras.

Got it.

Start your day with a big hurray

Chocolate Diddlers
Chocolate Diddlers

A bowl of fun for everyone

Chocolate Diddlers
Chocolate Diddlers

Yum

Uh...

Well, I like the lyric.

Uh, you know, it's kind of...
It's upbeat, uh, celebratory.

You know, "hurray, fun, yum." Um...

- Uh, if I had a note, it would be the music.
- What about it?

Uh, well, it doesn't say,
yummy breakfast treat...

so much as it says,
my puppy's dead.

- Yeah, I've been a little down lately.
- I know, I know.

- But, uh, keep working on it.
- Okay.

- Well, I'm off.
- Where are you going?

To have drinks with Lyndsey
and her friends.

Have a good time.

You know,
you're welcome to tag along.

A couple of these women are divorced,
got a few miles on them...

but they've been liposucked to an inch
of their lives, so they present well.

- That's okay, I gotta work.
- You sure?

For somebody like you,
it'd be shooting fish in a barrel.

In this case, the fish would be
40-year-old, neurotic soccer moms...

and the barrel
would be a Bennigan's in Encino.

- Sounds tempting, but I'll pass.
- Okay, good night.

Oh, honestly,
think more bouncy, happy.

I love Chocolate Diddlers, yay

Got it.

Okay, bouncy, happy.

C is for chocolate, D's diabetes

Do your kids a favor
And buy a box of Wheaties

Chocolate Diddlers, yay

Okay, that's a good day's work.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Charlie.
- Veronica.

How's life treating you, Veronica?

Not too bad. How about you?

Well, that depends
on which answer you want.

There's more than one?

I could give the "Everything's
hunky-dory, I live at the beach...

drive a nice car and have
a python in my pants" answer.

- Or I could tell you the truth.
- You have an inchworm in your pants?

No, the python part's true.

Okay, so, what is wrong with Charlie?

All right, fine, I'll tell you.

Two bourbons, straight up.
You want anything?

I'm good.

I'll spare you the details of my selfish,
narcissistic, soul-sucking mother...

my deadbeat,
oddly effeminate brother...

and the future organ donor
we call my nephew.

Okay.

And just to bring you up to speed
on my recent romantic adventures...

about this time last year, I was
engaged to the greatest gal I'd ever met.

- Uh-huh. So, what went wrong?
- Hard to pinpoint.

It could've been my drinking,
my compulsive gambling.

Or it could've been me
sleeping with her best friend.

I can see why it'd be hard to pinpoint.

I know, right?

So anyway,
she dumped me for a nice guy.

But I got right back on the horse
and married a drug-addled stripper.

And that didn't work out?

Not for the reasons you'd think.

She was already married. Whoops.

So I figured
maybe I'd take a break for a while...

from the dating
and just see hookers.

Sure.

Yeah, I'm aware of the social stigma.

But I like to think of prostitution
as trickle-down economics.

Actually, it's all kind of trickle-down.

It's very Republican
when you think about it.

Uh-huh. You know what?
I will have another drink.

So I take the moral high ground and
try to break up with the 47-year-old...

so I won't be tempted
to hit on her hot 20-year-old daughter.

Laudable.

But surprise,
mom breaks up with me first...

because I still have feelings
for this crazy broad that stalks me.

Next thing I know,
my ex-girlfriend gets out of prison...

- Can I stop you a sec?
- Sure.

- Thank you.
- For what?

I came in here tonight because
I was angry at my pig of a boyfriend.

But after listening to you,
I realize I was unfair to him.

There's something below pig.

Okay, well, glad I could help.

How's life treating you?

In what universe
did I not hear everything you just said?

Nobody likes an eavesdropper.

Dude, your party
is a total sausage fest.

You said,
"Let's not invite the girls we know.

Let's meet new girls."

Exactly. So did you invite them?

- Who?
- The girls we don't know.

Dude, how can I invite them
if I don't know them?

Good point, dude.

Guess who brought beer.

Oh, God.

Wow. This is a total sausage fest.

Told you, dude.

Hey, gang,
there's hot quesadillas in the kitchen.

Charlie? What are you doing here?

I heard that Jake was having
a party and thought I'd stop by.

To hang out
with a bunch of teenagers?

Yeah, that occurred to me.

The cab driver
thought it was a good idea.

And it's a really long drive.

There's something
seriously wrong with you.

- Get help.
- First, I gotta get another cab.

Taxi.

It was nice of him to bring beer.

He's a crazy bastard,
but he's got good manners.

Taxi!

Knock, knock.

Not a good time.

Alan, you're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

That's okay, I'll say it. Who's there?

Go away, Charlie.

Go away Charlie, who?

I'm very sorry. What do you want?

I want to give you a heads up
that your ex-wife...

is gonna be calling you in the morning,
and it's not gonna be a pretty call.

- Hi, Lyndsey.
- Hi, Charlie.

You're a saint
for having sex with my brother.

Okay. Good night.

No, really.

It's like taking a bird with a busted wing
and putting him in a shoebox...

and feeding him
with an eyedropper.

You know he's never gonna fly,
but you give it your best shot.

Alan's the bird.

- What are you doing?
- Just resting.

- Your brother needs help.
- I know.

And for the record,
I believe I will fly again.

What do you want me to do, Judith?

He's a drunk with a lot of money.
You can't control people like that.

The best you can do
is stay on their good side...

so you can inherit their house
after they crap out their liver.

As a matter of fact,
I have given it a lot of thought.

Oh, fine, I will talk to him about it.

Okay. Okay, bye.

- Still think you're getting the house?
- What?

Not important.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

- Why did I wake up in your bed?
- You passed out there.

Did we break any biblical laws?

No. Uh, Lyndsey and I
went up to your room.

Ah, gross. Did you have sex in my bed?

Uh, no. Actually, the romance
of the evening pretty much evaporated...

after you curled up at our feet
like a drunken Labrador.

Well, that's good.

Let's play it safe
and take those sheets out of rotation.

- Okay.
- Uh, just to put it on the record.

I'm officially telling you on behalf of
my ex-wife, don't ever do that again.

Don't ever do what again?

It doesn't matter.
I fulfilled my obligation.

You know, Alan, I'm starting to think
I'm not living up to my full potential.

Really?

You think you can hump and drink
even more?

No. Well, maybe.

The thing is, I woke up this morning...

and there were these little voices
in my head telling me to get help.

Get help.

- Your brother needs help.
- I will fly again.

Better I realize it before somebody
has to point it out, huh?

Mm-hm. No doubt. So, what are you
gonna do with this newfound insight?

Well, I think it might be time
to go back to my shrink.

- Mm. Talk about your issues?
- Renew my prescriptions.

Much more in character.

- Come on in, Charlie.
- Thanks.

Well, it's been a while.
How you doing?

- Good, good.
- Really?

You usually only come see me
when your hair is on fire...

and someone's chasing you
with gasoline.

That almost happened to me once.

Thank God
I was able to pee on the matches.

So, what's going on?

Well, I just recently broke up
with this terrific gal...

and I guess I've been
in kind of an emotional tailspin.

Been drinking heavier than usual?

Just the occasional glass of wine
with dinner.

Uh-huh. And how many dinners
have you had today?

Three. So far.

Okay, go on.

And it's not just this break-up.

For the last couple of years, I've been
trying to have a meaningful relationship.

As opposed
to picking up some pretty little thing...

for a quick bag, shag
and skedaddle.

Bag, shag and skedaddle.

That's charming.

Anyway, no matter how hard I try
to have something more lasting...

more meaningful,
the end result is always the same.

At some point, I gotta consider the
possibility that the problem might be me.

That's not a bad instinct.

If I'm doing something wrong, it would
be helpful if I had a clue what it was.

Well, if you had to guess,
what would you say you're doing wrong?

I don't know. I love too much?

Guess again.

- I'm afraid of intimacy?
- Do you believe that to be true?

Not really, I just hear it all the time.

Dr. Phil, movies, TV shows,
ex-girlfriends.

Let me ask you something.

What do you think being truly intimate
with a woman is?

Uh...

Not using a condom?

Wow.

- What?
- I'm sorry, I didn't expect that. Um...

But what I'm trying to point you to
is a kind of intimacy...

where you feel safe enough
to be completely honest with a woman.

To tell her how you really feel.

Oh, come on,
nobody cares how you really feel.

And what's a guy
like me feel anyway?

I'll tell you. Tired, hungry, horny,
hung over, happy, sad and pissed off.

And sad and pissed off
only come into play...

because I'm horny, hungry,
hung over and tired.

You know what?
Let's table the intimacy discussion...

and talk about your other relationships.

What other relationships?

We've spoken
at great length about your feelings...

towards your mother, brother
and your nephew.

Pissed off, pissed off, sad.

Sure.
How about non-familial relationships?

- You mean like friends?
- Yes.

- Then why don't you just say friends?
- I got the diplomas, I like to use them.

Okay, well, the answer to your question is,
uh, I don't really have that many friends.

Well, how many friends
would you say you have?

You know, I'm starting
to feel a little pissed off now.

Do you have any friends, Charlie?

Come on, I'm a grown man.
I have acquaintances.

Do you spend time
with acquaintances?

For what? To talk about my feelings?

I'm not one to indulge in chitchat
unless I feel like it's gonna get me laid.

I'm just saying it might be nice
to have some relationships...

that aren't based solely
on you trying to get someone into bed.

You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

Not a clue.

Okay, now I'm pissed off and sad.

Maybe you didn't have enough dinner.

Thank you.

Uh, are you sure you should be drinking
if you're on medication?

No, she wouldn't give me anything.
Said I'd abuse it.

Where does that come from?

One more.

So, uh, did you get anything
out of the session?

She kept saying I need to develop
relationships that aren't about sex.

You know, I can see the wisdom in that.

Sure you can. You didn't get laid
the last nine years of a 12-year marriage.

Not true. There were birthdays.

Let's pretend the shrink is right.
What am I supposed to do?

Just somehow go out and make
new guy friends? Who does that?

Couldn't hurt to try.

- Hey, there, how are you?
- Good, you?

I've already lost interest.

Well, I can't fault you for trying.

I mean,
I'm not against having a friend in theory.

But I'm a 43-year-old man
who's kind of set in his ways.

Where am I supposed
to meet this new buddy?

Did you consider
you could have a woman as a friend?

Alan, have you not been listening?
She said no sex.

Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I don't have many friends either.

- You don't have any friends.
- Well, neither do you.

But that's my choice.
You, you're just a social pariah.

And you're a malignancy
on the ass of mankind.

You wanna pick up a pizza...

on the way home?
- Pizza, really?

- Fine, what do you want?
- Um, I was thinking Chinese.

- We just had Chinese. How about ribs?
- I'm a little low on cash.

- What's a little low mean?
- Nothing.

All right, I'll buy,
but I get to pick the movie.

Oh, we don't have to watch a movie.
I TiVo-ed Glee.

I'm miserable and you wanna torture me
with hot chicks in cheerleading outfits.

Singing hot chicks.
It's Wang Chung week.

For God's sake, why don't you just put
on assless chaps and get it over with?

I'm not gay, I'm metrosexual.

That's just a gay man who can't get laid.

Everybody have fun tonight

Everybody Wang Chung tonight

The tall blond chick in the red tracksuit
is really starting to freak me out.

Everybody Wang Chung tonight

Everybody have fun

I love Mercedes. You go, girl.

.......... ********** ..........

No, Charlie. It's mine.

- What?
- Give it back.

Ow. Mom, Charlie hit me.

Oh, okay.

Consuela, Charlie hit me.

Ow. Mom, Consuela hit me.

Oh, God, here we go again.

I'll run away and then you'll be sorry.

Ow. Mom, Charlie's
making me hit myself.

Hey, what are you doing up?

Your brother's
talking in his sleep again.

No kidding. What about?

Some childhood dream
about you making him hit himself.

What childhood? That was last week.

SportsCenter?

Yeah, I'm making my picks
for tomorrow's games.

Really, Charlie?
Taking the points against Georgetown?

No?

If you wanna throw your money away,
just get married without a prenup.

You know something I don't?

So far this year...

Georgetown's covered the spread
eight times out of ten.

- Wow. You bet college basketball?
- Only idiots bet college basketball.

- No offense.
- How do you know this stuff?

I worked for a sports book in Vegas.
I opened my business...

in the back of a candle shop
in Sherman Oaks.

I wondered how those
stayed in business.

Yeah, so did the IRS.

So they nailed you for running a book?

No, a candle store that made
a quarter of a million dollars a year.

Without selling one freaking candle.

Okay, so no on Georgetown.

Does Alan know about this?

He knows about the candle store.
Let's keep the other part between us.

Yeah, he's kind of prissy
about moral stuff like gambling.

- Yeah, he is.
- And drinking.

That's only because when he drinks,
he gets all weepy, then he pukes.

- And whoring.
- He doesn't have a problem with that.

He's just cheap and he likes to cuddle.

Well, don't worry, your sordid
gambling past will be our secret.

- I'm glad to know I can trust you.
- Of course, you can.

Hey, I never told him
about your little soft-core film career.

Oh, God.
You saw Cinnamon's Buns?

Not all the way through.

Though I am very familiar...

with the bakery-shop scene
in the middle.

You know, with the frosting gun.

I was 19. I needed the money.
They promised me it would be tasteful.

It looked very tasteful.

And delicious.

Yum, yum.

Glad to hear you enjoyed it.

Yeah. I don't think
you were well-served by the screenplay.

Screenplay? There was just
a greasy guy behind the camera:

"Do this, do that, more frosting."

It's kind of weird.

You and I have more in common
than you and my brother.

All right, let's take something
off the table right away.

- What's that?
- My ass.

- That's not what I was getting at.
- Charlie...

in spite of my past, I'm just
a nice little Valley soccer mom now.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Soccer mom?
Your kid's a babbling pothead.

He played soccer when he was ten.
He scored two goals.

- In one game?
- In one season. Shut up.

The point is
I am way past guys like you.

What do you mean, "guys like me"?

Guys I'd have to dip in ammonia
before I'd let them anywhere near me.

Oh, those guys.

Long as we're being honest, I am happy
with the way things are between us.

Besides, you're really good for Alan.

- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, no.

You're smart, you're strong,
you're self-sufficient...

and he's, well, not.

You underestimate your brother.

It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.

You'll see. One of these days,
he's gonna surprise you.

One of these days,
I'm gonna die of liver failure.

Wanna lay odds which happens first?

- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.

Ammonia?

- Am I that skeevy?
- Yes.

- Morning.
- Good morning.

- Lyndsey leave yet?
- No. Why?

No reason. Just trying to keep track
of who's in my house.

Don't worry, she's leaving very soon.

I'm not worried.
Actually, I like having her around.

You, not so much.

Thank you.
That never ceases to be funny.

Ah! Cinnamon buns.

- How did you know?
- I bought them.

Oh, right. Cinnamon buns.
Who doesn't love cinnamon buns?

Ugh! Charlie.

What, what?
Alan bought cinnamon buns.

With frosting.

Oh!

Yum.

All right, honey, I'll see you later.

- I'll call you after work.
- See you.

Hey, Lynds,
has your son picked a college yet?

Uh, no. Why?

Well, I was just wondering...

if he were to choose between, say...

North Carolina and Kentucky...

which would you encourage him
to pick?

As an out-of-state resident...

Kentucky is two and a half times
more expensive.

I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.

Interesting. Well, I hope he gets in.

- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

- What was that all about?
- Hmm?

Since when do you care
about her kid's education?

Young people are our future, Alan.
I care about them all.

The only young people
you care about...

are sliding down a pole
to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.

Those aren't dollar bills.
Those are twenties.

- When did you become a cynic?
- When did you...

become so interested in the comings
and goings of my girlfriend? Or her kid?

- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill.
- I will not chill.

And what was all that about
liking having her around?

- Nothing. I like having her around.
- Yeah, but around what?

- Excuse me?
- I think when you say "around"...

you mean "under."

- Don't go down that road.
- Why shouldn't I go down that road?

Is it slippery when wet?

Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?

I think a better question
would be, what's gotten into you?

I mean, who have you gotten into?

Alan, Alan, listen to me very carefully.

I have not had sex with your girlfriend.

- Still in the planning stages.
- No.

- But you want her.
- No.

- Why not? What's wrong with her?
- Nothing. She's terrific.

So you do want her.

When it comes to Lyndsey...

you have
absolutely nothing to worry about.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's what
you said about Wendy Freidman...

and Kathy Bell
and Amy Driskell.

- Who?
- They're all girls you stole from me.

What? I never stole anybody from you.

Ha, ha. Wendy Freidman, sixth grade,
Halloween party.

I went to get her punch, when I came
back, you were bobbing for her apples.

- Innocent fun.
- Ha! Kathy Bell, ninth grade.

I brought her home.
I went to the bathroom.

When I come back,
you were teaching her French.

Harmless horseplay.

Amy Driskell, sophomore year.

First girl
who let me get to second base.

All right, her I nailed.

Wait, wait. Wait. You nailed her?

Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.

It took me six months
just to touch her right boob.

- You missed the signals, didn't you?
- What signals?

In my case,
taking off her sweater and saying:

"Quick, do me before Alan gets back
from his trumpet lesson."

Clarinet.
I didn't have the lip for trumpet.

Apparently, you didn't have
the lip for Amy either.

But all that was a long time ago.
You're with Lyndsey now.

What's important is that I wish you both
a long and happy life together.

- Really?
- From the bottom of my heart.

- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Though, I'd still like you to move out.

Got it.

- Soon.
- Right.

No, I guess that's about it.

Amy Driskell.

"No, Alan,
I'm saving myself for Jesus."

Come on in.

Hey.

- Wow! The place looks great.
- Doesn't it?

Even better than before I accidentally
almost burned it to the ground.

Yeah.

You're welcome.

Come here.
I wanna give you something.

Oh, heh.
Fooling around? On the new couch?

Get your mind out of the gutter.
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.

Here.

- A house key?
- Uh-huh.

For this house?

Maybe we're not ready
to move in together...

I want you to feel like you can come
and go without checking in with me.

Wow. Thank you.

In a lot of ways,
this isn't just the key to your house...

it's the key to your heart.

Don't gay it up.

Listen, I'm thinking of having
a housewarming party next Saturday.

- Great. What can I do?
- You can help me with the guest list.

What would you say
about inviting Judith and Herb?

- My ex?
- They live across the street...

Herb is always so sweet to me.

Every time Herb looks at you
he's pretending you're wet and naked.

All right, fine, I won't invite them.
Probably just upset Judith anyway.

Yeah, you're right.

You know what? Let's invite them.

- Take the high road.
- All right.

- What about Berta?
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

- Why not?
- She's kind of mean to me.

Honey, that's just
because she doesn't like you.

Fine. Berta.

- And Jake.
- Oh, of course. Great.

- And Charlie.
- There it is.

- There what is?
- Charlie.

Why do you want Charlie
to come to your party?

Why? When this place burned,
he took us in.

He took me in seven years ago,
I don't feel the need to invite him.

Oh, come on, he's a great guy.
I really like him.

- Of course. All the women like Charlie.
- All the women?

Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell,
Amy Driskell.

- Who?
- And now Lyndsey MacElroy.

Oh, please.
Charlie and I are just friends.

No, no. My brother does not
befriend women, he befouls them.

Are you saying you don't trust me?

No. I don't trust Charlie.
For him, you're unexplored territory.

At some point,
he's gonna try and plant his flag in you.

And when I say "flag," I mean his:

Flag.

Okay. You're out of your mind.

I do not want you
hanging out with my brother.

You can be courteous to him.
Like, "Hey.

You've got some vomit on your shoe."

Or "Hey, Charlie,
do you need me to move my car...

so your hooker
can park her pink Camaro?"

Do you realize how insulting this is?

You don't get to tell me
who I can be friends with.

It's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.

- You know what, I made a mistake.
- Well, I forgive you.

- Give me my key back.
- What?

- Give it to me.
- How can I come and go?

You could forget coming.
You're just gonna be going.

We were doing so good.

We were.
Then you started talking and spoiled it.

Wait. Okay, okay. Just to clarify.

You're not as angry with me now as you
were when I burned down your house.

Okay, we'll talk
after you've gained some perspective.

Jake, Berta, let's go.
Party train's leaving.

That what you're wearing?

- I'm not going.
- Well, why not?

- She and I had a little argument.
- That's too bad. Jake, Berta, let's go.

Charlie, if you do
what I think you're gonna do...

I swear to God,
I will never speak to you again.

Really?

Then by all means, tell me exactly
what you think I'm gonna do.

You know what I'm talking about.

All right, I'm gonna
run this down for you one last time.

I have no interest in Lyndsey...

and she has even less interest in me.
- I don't believe you.

You're right.
I'm going to your girlfriend's house.

- I'm gonna do her on the couch.
- No, you won't.

- Why not?
- Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.

You remember
to get the housewarming gift?

Jake's got it. Jake.

- Very funny.
- We thought so. Ha.

- How come you're not dressed?
- He and Lyndsey had a fight.

Oh. That sucks. See you.

- So you're just gonna sit here all night?
- Oh, I'll be fine.

Oh, I'm sure you will,
but if you get bored...

there's a load of laundry in the dryer
you could fluff and fold.

- So you want me to do your job?
- Somebody has to.

Well, I guess
there's nothing left to say except...

you're an idiot.

I may be an idiot, but at least
I'm home by myself reading Moby Dick.

Upside-down.

Might as well.

Maybe she'll like me better.

Where's Eldridge?
He lives here, right?

- Yeah. He's hiding in his room.
- How come?

He gets really paranoid
when he's "highding" in his room.

I just came to get him these snacks.
Bye.

Amateurs.

- Nice party.
- Thanks.

So give me the lay of the land.

You mean
who in this land can you lay?

If you will.

All right. Hot redhead by the bar.
That's Wanda.

Recently came out
of a terrible marriage.

Nice, nice.

What else you got?

Pretty blond on the couch.
That's Terry.

She divorced her husband
to be a lesbian.

How's that working out for Terry?

See the dirty look
she's giving Wanda?

Oh. I think I see an opening.

And by that you mean?

I wasn't being subtle.
I see an opening.

I knew it.

Anything good in my life,
you have to take it away.

"Oh, Charlie,
you're so funny and so clever."

"Why don't I lean...

so you can look down my dress
and see my boobies?"

"Why, thank you. I believe I will."

"So do you wanna have sex now...

or wait until after the party?"

"You don't mind
I'm carrying most, if not all...

communicable diseases
known to man?"

"No. That's part of your charm."

"Come, take me on the couch."

"Are you sure? It's not Scotchgarded."

"No matter.
We'll Scotchgard it with our love."

Hello, Mr. Skunk.

Don't be alarmed. I was just leaving.

There's certainly no reason
to feel threatened.

Good skunk. Nice skunk.

Bad skunk.

Ahh! Oh, God, Oh, God.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Who's out there?

- Alan?
- Oh. Hey, Herb.

Oh! Oh, wow!

Hope you don't mind.
I got skunked.

You sure did.

How come
you're not at Lyndsey's party?

I wanted to, but Judith came down
with a sudden migraine.

And by "migraine,"
I mean "bitch fit."

- Got it.
- How about you?

Lyndsey and I had
kind of a falling out.

Because you showed up
smelling like a skunk?

- No, no. It's a long story.
- I got time.

I think she's fooling around
with Charlie behind my back.

Charlie? That lucky duck.

- What?
- I said, that son of a bitch.

Story of my life.

Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell,
Amy Driskell.

Amy Driskell? I lost my virginity
to Amy Driskell.

- You're kidding.
- Never even had to ask.

Our first date.

Never got out of the driveway.

We weren't even in a car.

You know what's good for getting rid
of skunk smell? Tomato juice.

- Great. You got any?
- No.

- We might have some V8.
- Think that'll work?

Well, it sure doesn't
taste like tomato juice...

but you couldn't possibly
smell any worse. Hang on.

What else could go wrong?

Of course.

I'm standing in dog crap.

I can't tell you how happy it makes me
to bring two friends back together.

- Any better?
- Not really.

Well, that's all the V8.

- Wanna try some ketchup?
- Why not?

I found this in one of my son's shoes.

Oh, yeah.
I can get you better than this.

That's what I was hoping.

Lyndsey.

Alan? What the hell are you...?

- Whoa!
- Where is he?

Where is who? What is that smell?

Skunk, dog crap and ketchup.

And don't try to change the subject.
Where's my brother?

He left about 20 minutes ago
with two women.

- Really?
- Really.

So you and he aren't?

That's what I've been telling you,
you smelly fool.

Wow.

Guess we had nothing to fight about.
Ha, ha.

Hug?

I'll call you.

You don't scare me.

You already shot your load.

Although I suppose
you could be a different skunk.

So all I'm saying is,
given my history...

Alan's paranoia
is not uncalled for.

No, no, this wasn't paranoia.
This was insanity.

- I know, I know...
- The man was covered in ketchup.

To be fair, there was a time in your life
when you were covered in frosting.

It's not the same thing.
I was putting myself through college.

Look, all I know
is that Alan really loves you.

If you repeat this, I will deny it.

My brother is the most
decent human being I know.

Can't you just give him
one more chance?

- Well, I suppose...
- I knew it.

You bastard. You slut.

So, what do you say?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

Hi, Charlie.

You should know
I didn't come over to ruin your date.

Really. Why did you come?

To tell you that I'm getting married.

Today's the big day, huh?

Oh, please. There's no wedding.

Would it make a difference to you...

knowing that cute face will never
pop over that railing again?

That the one woman who's always
loved you and been there for you...

is forever out of reach?

Come on.

Where we going?

The church. I'm gonna prove to you
she's not getting married.

Look. Tell me if you see a wedding.

I see a wedding.

Two persons present
now come to be joined.

Rose and Manfred...

She's really doing it.

Let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

And we're clear.

Yep. That ought to do it.
Thanks, Freddy.

Eenie, meenie, minie, mo...

catch a tiger...

Oh, who am I kidding?
I love you all.

Let's see, what else do we need?

Oh, right, ice. Water in a useful form.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Everybody all right?

- Charlie?
- Rose?

What a nice surprise.

- How are you?
- Oh, good, good, good. You look great.

Thank you.
Married life agrees with me.

That's right. Congratulations.
So where you living now?

Manny and I moved into
my beach house.

Oh! So we'll be neighbors again.

I'll have to come by and meet him.

I don't think that's a good idea.

The old boyfriend meeting
the new husband. It's a little awkward.

Yeah, I guess you're right. I've never
been that popular with husbands.

Or fathers, or boyfriends, sons,
surly lesbian roommates.

- So anyway, you're happy?
- More than I ever dreamed possible.

You know what he said to me
the other day?

Without me at his side,
he might as well not exist.

Wow. That's a little gay, but all right.

What about you?
Is there anyone special in your life?

No, not really. I mean, there's gals
with special skills, but I gotta pay extra.

You should find someone
who loves you the way Manny loves me.

The love is the same.
It's just at an hourly rate.

Don't grow old alone, Charlie.

Right.

- Bye.
- Bye.

What is it with women?

They go off and get married and all of
a sudden seem a lot more beautiful.

No matter, McTavish.

We can grow old together.

After all, you're only 20.

But I doubt you're gonna see 21.

- Is it on?
- I think so.

All right, let's do this.

Hi, I'm Jake Harper,
and this is The Human Volcano.

We begin by drinking a warm can of
Diet Coke.

That's not Coke, dude.

Yeah, my dad did the shopping.

Anyway, a warm diet cola product.

And now, I will swallow a Mentos.

Mentos.

Now I'll lay on the floor.

- Goggles.
- Right. Safety first.

- You feel anything yet?
- Oh, yeah. It's working.

If it starts coming out the back door,
pull your pants down and roll over.

Good thinking.

- Hey, what's going on?
- Not a good time, Dad.

What are you doing on the floor?

Awesome.

What the hell are you doing?

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

Yeah, we were making a video of...
Hold on.

- Cool stunts.

Cool stunts? In God's name, why?

- You've heard of Jackass?
- Yeah?

We are Dumbass.

Really.

How ever did you come up
with that name?

Well, we were thinking,
what's better than Jackass?

No.
It's kind of a rhetorical question.

No, it wasn't that hard.

It came down to a choice between
Dumbass and The Asskateers.

I think you made the right call.

- Really?
- Oh, yes. I applaud your decision.

The plan is we shoot cool stunts,
post them online and sell advertising.

Who on earth would advertise on that?

Well, right off the bat,
we figure Coke and Mentos.

It's a product placement bonanza.

Come on, let's go upload
our premiere episode.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What about this mess?

Damn it.

I'm gonna be taking care of that kid
till I'm 90.

Please, God,
don't make me live that long.

You'll never guess who I ran into
at the supermarket. Rose.

Oh. She's back from her honeymoon?

And living down the beach
with her new husband.

- Good for her.
- Yeah. Good for her.

You have to forget about her, Charlie.

I know. That's why I got me
some milk of amnesia.

Nice.

What you doing down there?

Wiping up cola vomit
my son spewed in my face.

Oh, great.
The Human Volcano worked.

- You knew about this?
- It was my idea.

- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

It'll make a great first episode
of The Asskateers.

Actually, I think they went
with Dumbass.

Oh, damn, I already had
a bunch of T-shirts made up.

What can I say?

You gotta like that your son's
got entrepreneurial spirit.

Thanks for showing me
the bright side.

No problem. Memory wipe?

I think I will.

Looking for Japanese subs, captain?

What? No, I'm just trying out
these new binoculars.

You're spying on Rose, aren't you?

It's not spying, it's...
Shut up and leave me alone.

You said you were gonna forget her.

And you said you were gonna move out
after a few days.

Don't change the subject.

I'm just trying to get a glimpse
of her husband.

Oh! That's really sad.

Sadder than throwing your back out
trying to pleasure yourself?

I was doing yoga.

Then why were you wearing lipstick?

And again, don't change the subject.

I am simply curious to see
what kind of guy Rose would marry.

If that's the case,
why don't you go over there...

knock on the door
and shake the man's hand?

What would I tell him? "I'm Charlie,
your wife used to stalk me"?

I might leave that part out.

Besides,
I'm sure he already knows about you.

- How would he know about me?
- Well, it's possible she told him.

Uh, or perhaps he noticed the tattoo
of your face on her left butt cheek.

I kind of wish she hadn't done that.

After she takes a hot bath, I start
looking like Edward James Olmos.

Just go over, introduce yourself
and welcome him to the neighborhood.

I guess you're right. Bring over wine,
a little housewarming gift.

Now you're talking.

Geronimo!

- Oh, God! Are you all right?
- Mostly.

Did you remember to get it on video?

Aw, crap.

Charlie, what are you doing here?

I thought I'd welcome you guys
to the neighborhood.

This is a bad idea. Please go.

I thought we could
get to know each other.

Listen to me, Charlie.

I love my husband.
I'm building a new life with him...

and I won't let you ruin it.
- How could I ruin it?

He doesn't know you exist,
and I plan on keeping it that way.

What about the tattoo?

I added glasses to it
and told him it was Harry Potter.

Now, please get out of here.

Okay. Fine. I'm sorry.

Just so I'm clear, you and I, we're...

Over. Finished.

Okay. I get it.

Told you he'd stop by.

Do you realize how lucky you are?
You could have broken your necks.

We took precautions.

You flew off the roof!

In a shopping cart!

What precautions?

We were planning to land
in the ocean.

You missed it by a hundred yards.

It's not an exact science, Dad.

Okay. Let's not dicker over the details.

He said dicker.

- I know.
- Okay, okay. I am serious, okay?

This Dumbass thing stops right now.

You're the one who told me
I should follow my dreams.

I meant dreams like doctor or lawyer,
not crash test dummy.

Doctor Jacob Harper.
I like the sound of that.

Hey, doc, what's this on my nut sack?
Is it infected?

Yes, it seems we'll have to perform
a nut sack-ectomy.

Will you two quit...

with the cockamamie babble...

and focus on
what I am trying to tell you?

He said cockamamie.

He said focus.

Oh, what's to become of my son?

Don't worry, Alan.
There'll always be carnivals.

I suppose.

So how'd it go with
Mr. And Mrs. Manfred Quinn?

I never met him.
Rose told me to get lost.

Wow. That's gotta sting a bit.

Yeah, but I understand. She's happy now
and doesn't want me screwing it up.

You still love her, don't you?

I guess I do.

Funny how these things turn out,
isn't it?

I mean, eight, nine years ago,
she was just a crazy one night stand...

who ended up stalking you...

and all you wanted to do
was get rid of her.

But the years go by...

and stalking turns to friendship...

friendship turns to love.

But it's too late.

She marries another man,
and she's lost to you forever.

Boy, that would make
a great movie, wouldn't it?

Yeah, great.

Wanna write it with me?

What? No.

Well, don't go stealing it.

I mean, you know, it's your life,
but it's my idea.

Oh! How's this for a title:

Look Who's Stalking?

Meet the Stalkers.

Avatart.

- Are you done?
- Yeah.

Although I do think it has
real franchise opportunities.

Could be a sitcom.

Maybe not on a major network.

But, you know, TBS, TNT.

I Love Loony.

Where you going?
I was just spitballing here.

I said spitballing.

Oh, God, I wanna die.

That has gotta be the worst-looking
toupee I've ever seen.

What the hell are you doing here?

You scared the hell out of me.

Are you crazy? Climbing up on my deck,
snooping around like this?

I need to talk to you.

Well, I can't talk to you.
Manny is right inside.

- I love you.
- It's a little late for that.

Sorry. I realize now, Rose,
I can't live without you.

It doesn't matter what you realize.
I'm married.

Oh, please, Rose.

Charlie, why are you doing this to me?
It's so unfair.

I'm begging you. Just talk to me.

All right. Manny has to go back
into the office to do some work.

- Come back in an hour.
- Thank you.

- Just to talk.
- Of course.

And can you bring me some
Butter Brickle ice cream?

- What?
- And marshmallow fluff and sprinkles.

- Whatever you need.
- Chocolate sprinkles.

- Not the multicolored kind.
- Fine.

I don't know
why they even make those.

- Okay. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

Son of a bitch. How do you do that?

Don't lock your knees.

Good news, Manny.
We're getting ice cream.

Ready for some more beans?

Bring it on.

So I'm thinking we call this stunt
Fart Rocket.

No, I think we need to go
with something more intellectual.

How about
The Dumbass Assblaster?

No, you can't use two asses in a row,
it's redumbnant.

Hey.

What's going on?

I'm just making Eldridge
something to eat.

Really.

Yes, I was peckerish.

You mean peckish.

Fine, if you wanna dicker.

Good one, dude.

- Hey.
- What's in the bag?

Butter Brickle ice cream...

with marshmallow fluff
and chocolate sprinkles.

Oh, Charlie, no.

- What?
- "What?"

Only one person puts...

chocolate sprinkles and marshmallow
fluff on Butter Brickle.

Congratulations, Sherlock.
You cracked the case.

- She is a married woman, Charlie.
- I can't help it. I love her.

You didn't start loving her until
you found out you couldn't have her.

So? That doesn't make it not love.

But what if her husband catches you?

Then he shoots me,
and you can have my house.

Go to her, Charlie. She's waiting.

Ow! Son of a bitch!

Dude, don't waste it. Squeeze it in.

Not as easy as it looks, is it?

No.

- Is your husband gone?
- He just left. We're alone.

- Oh, great.
- Wait. We agreed, just talking.

Yeah. Right, right, right.
Just talking. Let's talk.

You know what Manny said to me
before he left?

Um, "It's okay to have
an affair with Charlie...

because he's a swell guy
and I'm secretly gay"?

No. He said in the whole world,
I'm the only one who can move him.

Like I said, gay.

How can I betray a man like that?

I can think of several ways.

You on top, you on bottom,
everybody facing the TV.

Charlie.

Who moves you, Rose? Him or me?

I don't know, I'm confused.
I love Manny.

You and I are soul mates.
Like Romeo and Juliet.

Really? Did Romeo ever
chew through the ropes...

holding him to a radiator
in a motel...

when Juliet was just trying to give him
a birthday surprise?

Birthday surprise?
You were gonna brand me.

Branding is the new piercing, Charlie.

Fine. Pierce me. Brand me.
Do anything you want.

- Anything?
- It's just an expression.

- Gimme another chance, Rose.
- No. It's wrong.

Fine. You just say the word
and I'll go.

Time's up.

- I love you.
- I love you too.

- You know what this means don't you?
- I think so.

You're going to have to kill Manny.

- What?
- Kidding.

Just wanted to see how far you'd go.

- Can I tell you something, Rose?
- Anything.

I've never felt happier and more at peace
than I do at this very moment.

Who's being a little gay now?

It's a text from Manny.
He's on his way home. You have to go.

When can I see you again?

- You can't. This was a mistake.
- How can you say that?

Charlie, I love my husband.

Forget Manny. Run away with me.

- You don't mean that.
- I do.

Come on, Charlie.

If you had me,
you'd be tired of me within a year.

Then you can go back to Manny.
Everybody wins.

Go.

I love you.

Oh, aren't you the naughty boy
who likes to watch.

- Hurry up. I'm about to blow.
- Hang on.

Hi, I'm Jake Harper.

You're about to witness
a little something we like to call...

Fumes of Fury.

Let's do this thing.

Remember, if for some reason
you don't reach the ocean...

just tuck and roll.
- Okay. Hurry up.

All right. Let her rip.

Dumbasses.

Can't believe nothing happened.

I wouldn't say that.
I think I crapped my pants.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

Persons present now come
to be joined. Rose and Manfred...

She's really doing it.

- Rose is getting married.
- And we're clear.

Yep. That ought to do it.

Thanks, Freddy.

- Who moves you, Rose? Him or me?
- I love Manny.

Fine. You just say the word
and I'll go.

Time's up.

Charlie, you home?

Charlie?

Hello?

Didn't you hear me?

Didn't you see me trying to hide?

Cute. Okay.

How would you feel
if I said I was moving out?

Same way Charlie Brown feels
when Lucy offers to hold the football.

Excited, but with a skepticism
born out of countless disappointments.

Ha-ha-ha. I deserve that.

But it's different this time. Read this.

"A larger penis can be yours
with a non-invasive surgical procedure."

No. No. Next to it. There.

"Dr. Dave Ciambotti."

Orange County's
number one chiropractor.

"Mention this ad for 20 percent discount
and a free Spinebuster key chain."

What's this have to do
with moving out?

I went to school with Dave Ciambotti.
We were roommates.

Say no more.

You're finally out of the closet
and shacking up with Dr. Dave.

Congratulations,
God bless you both.

No. No.

It's okay, Alan. I don't judge.

Although I'm sure
Old Dave could do better.

Will you stop?

Okay, Dave and I had
the same education, the same skills.

We started our practice
at the same time.

But he does three times the business
that I do. You know why?

He offers happy endings?

Target market advertising.

Another way of saying
"happy ending"?

No, no. It means newspaper ads,
uh, fliers, radio spots.

Since Dave started doing it,
his business has been through the roof.

How much is this gonna cost me?

No, no. The question is,
how much is it gonna earn you?

I'll stick with my question.

Charlie, I'm willing to let you in...

on the ground floor
of an amazing business opportunity.

Still waiting for a number, Alan.

Five thousand dollars.

Five grand?

For 2 I'd have you buried in the desert
and have 3 to get myself a larger penis.

To be honest,
that'd just be gilding the lily.

Come on. With targeted advertising,
I could double the size of my practice.

Wow, a second patient.

You're not listening. Once the profits
start rolling in, I can move out.

Once I grow boobs, I can start dancing
the lunch shift...

at Les Girls, Girls, Girls.

I'm serious. This is a chance
that could turn my life around.

- Did you ask Mom for money?
- Seriously?

No, I'm just grasping at straws.

So, what do you say?

Okay, fine. I'll give you 5 grand...

knowing full well that I'll never see it
again, and wishing that it was you.

Thank you, Charlie. Thank you so much.
You are not gonna regret this.

You have $5000 in your sweatpants?

I prefer to think of it as three hookers
and a Philly cheesesteak.

Hang on a sec.

Hello? Oh, hey, Rose.

Why don't I count it while you talk?

He's gone? Well, great.

I'll be over in five minutes
with bells on.

No, no, no,
it's just a figure of speech.

But... Sure,
I suppose I could try to find some bells.

Okay, I'll see you soon.

I gotta run.
Her husband's at a meeting.

Oh, Charlie, really?

The woman's trying to build a new life
and you're gonna have an affair?

- You want this money or not?
- Give her my best.

Aw, heh.

That was easy money.

Hi, Mom.

Do you have a minute to hear about
an amazing business opportunity?

So it isn't really a favor for me
as much as it's an opportunity for you.

Right.

Why don't you just ask your brother
for the money?

I thought of that,
but after all he's done for me...

I'd feel horrible asking for a loan.

And after all I've done for you?

I still feel horrible, but you never
threaten to smother me in my sleep.

Not since you learned to talk, anyway.

- How much?
- Well, I'm, uh, gonna take out some ads...

in the PennySaver, and on local radio,
probably some circulars.

Uh, maybe one of those giant
compressed-air guys...

with the flailing arms, you know?

Um, I think I'll need...

$10,000?

- All right.
- Although I could make do..."All right"?

You're my son. I should at least pretend
to believe in you.

Wow. Uh...

Thank you. Heh.

I'm putting American Cancer Society
on the memo line. Just ignore that.

No problem. You won't be sorry.

You'll get your money back,
plus interest.

Of course I am.

Never doubted it.

- That for luck?
- No, just kissing it goodbye.

What the hell was that?

It was the all-clear signal, silly.

You couldn't just say "all clear"?

All clear. All clear.

- Much better. When can I see you again?
- I don't know. I'll call you.

- How about tonight?
- We'll see. Now go.

- I love you.
- Because you can't have me.

No. This is real.
How can I prove it to you?

Vincent Van Gogh cut off his ear
for the woman he loved.

Think about it.

Would you settle for my brother's ear?

Bye.

Forgot your bells.

I almost forgot.
I need a hundred bucks.

- What for?
- SAT prep class.

Oh. Oh, sure. Glad to see
you're taking the test seriously.

If I don't do well,
then I can't get into a good college.

If I can't get into college,
I'll never get into grad school.

If I never get into grad school, what
kind of future can I look forward to?

What's the money really for?

Video games and online porn.

- You were gonna me give the money?
- I had a good week.

- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey, Herb.

Hey.

So how's it going?

Oh, you know. Living the dream.

Damn it, Herb,
how many times have I told you...

not to use the guest towels?

Hey, if I'm gonna sleep in the guest
room, I get to use the guest towels!

Yeah, I remember that dream.

- So how are things with you?
- Ah, could not be better.

Is that like me living the dream?

Oh, no, no, really. I'm, uh, working on
a pretty exciting business opportunity.

- Oh, no kidding.
- Yeah, it's, uh...

Well, actually, it's something
you might... No, you know, never mind.

So how's the pediatrician game?

Like taking money from babies.

Come on, tell me.
What business opportunity?

Well, it's an investment thing, but, uh,
Judith would never let you get into it.

And the fact that my mother and Charlie
are already in would just freak her out.

Your mother and brother invested?

They didn't do that out of love.

- No, they're not fond of you at all.
- Mm.

Well, anyway, it's good seeing you.

Alan, wait.
How much are we talking about?

Well, uh, my mother and Charlie
are each in for...

15,000.

I can do that.
Hang on, I'll get my checkbook.

Oh, and don't tell Judith.

The years I wasted
actually working for a living.

Schmuck.

- Hey, Mr. Harper.
- Hey, Gordon. How you been?

I'm almost 40 years old
and I'm delivering you a pizza.

Kind of says it all, doesn't it?

Pretty much.

That'll be 23.75.

Oh, let me get my wallet. Come on in.

Hang on a sec.

Hello? Oh, hey, baby.

I thought you said Manny was at work.
I thought this was our time together.

All right, fine.
Just call me when you can.

Damn.

Everything okay, Mr. Harper?

My date just cancelled.

Can't the service
send over another girl?

Not a girl like this one. This is the girl
I plan to spend the rest of my life with.

Probably regretting getting
the large then, huh? Heh.

- Wanna join me?
- Do I have to give back the tip?

- No, come on in.
- Okay.

So who's the woman?

- Remember Rose?
- My Rose?

- Your Rose?
- Yeah, we dated for a while.

No offense, Gordon, but I think she was
going out with you to make me jealous.

That's the only reason
she went out with anybody.

I don't know. There was
something special between us.

She was always getting me
love gifts: Cargo shorts...

bowling shirt,
20-year-old Scotch...

Yeah, I remember Rose.

So you guys are going out?

I wouldn't exactly call it going out.
She's kind of married.

Wow. Rose got married.

Yep.
To some clown named Manny Quinn.

Is he really a clown?

I have to ask because it's Rose.

No, no. He's in the fashion industry
or something.

Wow. So Rose is married
and cheating on her husband with you.

- Yep.
- God, I love your life.

Well, thanks,
but it's really not as fun as it looks.

- Really?
- I'm kidding.

Cheers.

To me.

Hey, Rose. It's Charlie again.
I don't know if you got my text.

Wanted to tell you I was thinking
about you, I can't wait to see you.

You know, when you can.

Love you. Really. I do.

- Hey, Charlie?
- Yeah?

When did you become a bitch?

What?
I was just leaving her a message.

The girl is married. Leave her alone.

I can't. I love her. I need her.

Bitch.

Oh, hey.

Been shopping?

- Little bit.
- A little bit?

Well, you know, uh,
a few pairs of socks, a new belt.

Couple of Dolce & Gabbana suits,
Gucci loafers and a Rolex.

Wow. Business must be picking up.

Uh, it is.

But not enough
to pay back your investor.

Oh. Oh, no. L...
I fully intend to pay you back.

In fact...

here...

is your initial investment, $5000.

And here is an additional $1000
in interest.

Berta? Are you seeing this?

Am I dreaming?

You got the Kardashian sisters
under the table?

- Nope.
- Then you're not dreaming.

Thank you for your confidence in me.

Hey, it's still confidence
if I'm figuring you'll fail.

I told you advertising would
drive in customers, and I was right.

- Hang on a sec.
- What?

Do you think more advertising
would drive in more customers?

I don't see why not.

Of course, the ads
would have to reach a larger audience...

and that would cost, you know,
more money.

Tell you what. Let it ride.

Really?

Hey, a 20 percent return
in a couple of weeks, come on.

In fact, here is another 4.

Hold on, I think I have more upstairs.

Oh, look in the back
of your underwear drawer.

I needed underwear.

You borrowed your brother's skivvies?
That's disgusting.

I agree. That's why when I found the
money, I took $100 to buy new ones.

So listen, can anybody get in
on this deal of yours?

Excuse me?

I'm always looking
for smart investments.

And I've got some extra cash...

that's a result of a little
hydroponic farming venture in Chino.

What are you farming?

Alfalfa. What's it to you?

I don't know, Berta, I mean...

You realize there's no guarantees.

You'd actually be doing me a favor.

My bank asks a lot of questions
about my alfalfa earnings.

All right, fine.
How much do you wanna invest?

- Ten grand?
- Great. Heh.

When can you get it to me?

As soon as I come back
from the bathroom.

Boy, I hope she means
it's behind the toilet.

- Who is it?
- Pizza.

Door's open. I'll be right down.

Hello.

- Gordon?
- Rose?

- Oh, my gosh, it's been so long.
- Yeah.

How are you doing?

Just great. Got a new shirt
with my name on it. Heh.

- Lighted sign for the roof of my car.
- How nice.

- How about you? Heard you got married.
- Yes. I'm now Mrs. Manfred Quinn.

Wow, congrats.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

So that will be 23.75.

Let me just get my purse.

Mrs. Manfred Quinn.

Manny Quinn.

Manny Quinn.

Holy crap, this is great.

It's real, Mom.

- You understand my skepticism.
- Sure.

And this is $12,000?

Yep. The 10,000 you gave me
plus your profit.

I don't know what to say.

How about,
"I'm proud of you. Well done"?

I'm proud of you, Alan. Well done.

"I knew you had it in you. Attaboy."

Let's not push it.

Okay, well, uh, again, thank you
for helping me get my business going.

I'll see you.

Hold on.

Yes?

Since you seem to be on a roll...

what would happen
if I didn't take my investment out?

And maybe threw in another 8
to make it an even 20,000?

Twenty thousand is a lot of money.

And as you're aware,
all investments carry risk.

Darling, if you cut me out, I'll kill you.

What can I say? You're in.

Alan has one L.

Oh.

- Hey, Mr. Harper.
- Hey, Gordon.

- 23.75?
- You got it.

I delivered a pizza to Rose
the other day.

Oh, yeah? Did you meet her husband?

You mean Manny?

Yeah.

I take it you haven't.

Well, no. For obvious reasons.

- What kind of guy is he?
- He's quiet.

A little stiff.

What did you say he did for a living?

He's some important figure
in the fashion industry.

Right, right.

So Manny Quinn.

An important figure
in the fashion industry.

Right.

Here's 30, keep the change.

Thanks.

Manny Quinn, Mr. Harper.

Fashion figure.

That's what I said.

Manny. Quinn. Figure.

- Uh-huh.
- Manny Quinn.

- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing. Good night.

Good night.

He's got the beach house, I'm delivering
pizzas. Un-fricking-believable.

- How dare you?
- Nice to see you too.

You go behind my back and talk
my husband into giving you some loan?

- Herb told you?
- Of course. We love each other.

And we love each other so much,
she went through my checkbook.

Not to worry.

I am very pleased to announce
that your investment has paid off.

That's your original $15,000
plus 20 percent interest.

- Wow.
- You're welcome.

- Can I see?
- Alan? Wait.

Yeah?

What if we don't wanna cash out?

Whatever do you mean?

Reinvest this, and add in six months
of your child support.

That money's supposed to be
for Jake.

Oh, don't be so naive.
You want it or not?

Sure, if you insist.

Well, see you.

Bye.

I'm thinking
somebody owes somebody an apology.

I'm sorry.

Ha-ha-ha. Unbelievable.

You ask for money
and they just give it to you.

And then you take the new money...

and use it to pay back
some of the old money.

But they don't want it back.
And they give you more.

Because they're greedy.

Greedy, greedy, greedy.

Oh, God, what have I done?

Oh, quit your whining.

Who said that?

Over here.

Hi. How you doing?

Not so good.

Feeling better?

This isn't happening.

I'm losing my mind.

Your mind is fine.

What you should be worried about
is losing your hair.

Now, do yourself a favor
and stop with the guilt.

How? I'm betraying my friends.
I'm betraying my family.

Feels good, doesn't it?

Yes... No.

L... Well... I'm not sure.

Come on. You've spent your whole life
being a doormat.

This is your chance
to get what you deserve.

What about the guilt?

The hell with the guilt.
Let's be bad guys.

- Bad guys?
- It's time for a change, don't you think?

Could we grow a mustache?

I've always wanted a mustache.

We're gonna grow balls.

Oh, good.

I've always wanted those too.

See you.

- Where you going?
- Out.

Out?

Yeah, out.

Got a problem with that?

No. Not at all.

All right then.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

Now come to be joined.

Rose and Manfred...

She's really doing it.

- Rose is getting married.
- And we're clear.

Yep. That ought to do it.

Thanks, Freddie.

Who moves you, Rose, him or me?

- I love Manny.
- Fine. You just say the word and I'll go.

- Time's up.
- Mm.

I am willing to let you
get in on the ground floor...

of an amazing business opportunity.

- How much is this gonna cost me?
- Five thousand dollars.

Okay, I'll give you the 5 grand,
knowing that I'll never see it again...

and wishing that it was you.

- How much?
- I think I'll need...

- Ten thousand dollars.
- All right.

- Although I could make due... All right?
- How much are we talking about?

- Fifteen thousand.
- Hang on, I'll get my checkbook.

Tell you what. Let it ride.

Really?

A 20 percent return
in a couple of weeks? Come on.

So, listen, can anybody
get in on this deal of yours?

You ask for money
and they just give it to you.

And then you take
the new money and use it...

to pay back some of the old money,
but they don't want it back.

And they give you more.
Because they're greedy.

Oh, God, what have I done?

Hi. I'd like a Jumbo Jack
and an apple turnover.

Do you want fries with that?

Sorry. I didn't realize
there was anybody in there. Um...

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned?

Are you asking me or telling me?

Telling you? I'm sorry.
I'm just not really sure of the rules.

When was your last confession?

Oh, wow, let's see. Uh, that would be...

Never?

- Are you even Catholic?
- No, but I'm a big fan.

The costumes, the music,
um, crackers and wine.

That's the body and blood of our savior.

I know. Mm-mm, good. Ha, ha.

You guys ever think about putting that
in supermarkets like a Lunchable?

What can I do for you, my son?

Oh, right to it. Heh.

Okay, just to be clear,
what I tell you is between you and me.

And the Lord.

Sure, but I'm not worried
about him blabbing. You, I just met.

Couldn't pick you out of a lineup.

Whatever you say here is confidential.

And I just drank a huge Arnold Palmer,
so could you get to it?

Absolutely, absolutely. Here it is.

Do you know what a Ponzi scheme is?

- I do. Are you an investment banker?
- No, I'm a chiropractor.

A chiropractic Ponzi scheme.
Okay, you piqued my interest.

Okay, long story short, I chiseled
my family out of a lot of money...

they're never gonna see again.
- You're feeling guilty.

Bingo. Hey, bingo. Ha, ha.
That's your racket, right?

Yeah, that's us.

You gotta like a God that's willing
to put the hustle on old ladies.

Arnold Palmer's on the 18th hole.

Right, right, sorry, sorry.

So I was hoping
that you could forgive me.

Are you prepared
to make restitution...

and confess what you've done
to your family?

Oh, God, no.

I was hoping you could give me
a few Hail Marys...

and I could make a donation
to the Church's legal-defense fund.

Win-win.

That's not how absolution works.

You have to make an act of contrition
and then do penance.

- Do I get to keep the money?
- No.

Ah.

Uh, you know what?

I'm just gonna mosey over
to Temple Beth Shalom...

and see what their deal is.

I'll get back to you.

Oy vey.

Wow.

Yeah.

That was incredible.

More than incredible.
It was transcendental.

This is where I was always meant to be,
Rose. Right here in your arms.

I'm so glad to hear you say that, Charlie.

Now get out.

- So soon?
- Manny will be home any minute.

But I wanna cuddle.

You want us to get caught?

This isn't fair.

The two of us sneaking around
so we can spend an hour together.

Well, what can I do? I have a husband.

Let's go away for the weekend.
Just the two of us.

Where?

I don't care. Someplace where we can
walk down the street holding hands.

Where we can laugh, play,
yell at the top of our lungs...

and not care who hears.
- So Disneyland?

I was thinking more in terms
of someplace with liquor, but...

That's Manny's car.

- I didn't hear anything.
- It's a Prius.

Just think about it, okay?

A romantic weekend
with nothing for us to do...

but make love and be together.

And, you know, drink.

Yay.

After all these years,
I finally get a weekend with Charlie.

Did you hear that, hubby?

Up top.

Think, damn it.

There's gotta be a way
to lose the guilt and keep the money.

There is.

You've made
enough trouble for me already.

Quit your bitching.

And for God's sake, stop washing
your hands like Lady Macbeth.

- I have to wash my hands. I just peed.
- So?

So, what if I don't wash
and then shake somebody's hand?

Screw them.
They were probably picking their nose.

Now listen to me.
You've gotta grow a pair.

Ah. I've got a pair.

You've got a pair of panties.

You can't talk to me like that.

And stay away from that darn priest.

I need somebody to talk to.

That's what I'm here for.

Dad?

Hey, buddy.

- Is there somebody in there with you?
- Oh, no. Nobody but me. See.

Then who were you talking to?

Oh, uh, I was just singing.

That wasn't singing.

Who are you, Simon Cowell?

- What do you want?
- I need to borrow 50 bucks.

Oh. Oh, sure.

Me and Eldridge went to visit this friend
of ours who's in the hospital...

but he forgot his book on the bus, so
I lent him mine but he lost that one too.

I have to buy two math books
because he's broke.

And there's this big math test coming up
and we were gonna study together for it.

Oversold it, didn't I?

- What's funny?
- Rose is at a party with her husband...

and she's sexting me
from under the table.

Sexting?

It's like regular texting,
but, you know, dirty.

- Hmm.
- You see, that's not a smiley face.

Charming. Um...

I need to talk to you about something.

Yeah, sure. What's up?

Oh, you bad girl. Ha, ha.

You know that money you gave to me
to invest in my business?

Yeah, what about it?

Well, here's the thing.

I know I said
I was gonna buy advertising...

I told Rose
about how well you're doing for me...

and now she wants in.

- She does?
- Oh, yeah. And she's loaded too.

Huh.

- So, what did you wanna talk about?
- Uh...

Just that we're making money
up the wazoo.

So you're gonna need a bigger wazoo.

That's great.

Man, she's not wearing
any underwear.

She texted you that?

Sent me a picture.

Excuse me, but I gotta respond.

Uh, let me just give you some privacy.

Where are you going?

Who's gonna take the picture?

So, Rose, I appreciate your interest,
but things are going incredibly well.

Yeah, I can barely handle
the volume of patients I have now.

Really?

Thirty thousand dollars?

Take it. Take it.

Shh, shh.

We can get a new car.

Maybe one with a working radio
and brakes.

You know what, Rose?

We've been friends a long time,
so I'm gonna make an exception here.

Ha, ha. You're welcome.

Can you wire the money over today?

I can give it to you right now.

Whoa.

You surprised me. Ahem.

Oh, Alan, Alan, Alan.

What are you doing?

Oh, uh, what do you mean?
I'm just taking a break between patients.

Oh, uh, uh...

Chiropractic x-ray glasses.

Cutting-edge stuff.

Oh, please.
There's nobody in the waiting room.

You don't even have a receptionist.

Oh, she's off. It's a Jewish holiday.

Which one?

What are you doing here?

Did you think I was gonna invest
without doing my due diligence?

Everybody else did.

- Now I know what's really going on.
- No, you don't.

You're stealing from your own family.

Oh. I guess you do.

Shame on you.

A whistle-blower.

This could be problematic.

Oh, boy, oh, boy.
She's gonna tell Charlie.

Charlie's gonna tell Mom,
then Berta, then Herb, then Judith.

Oh, my God, Judith.

Gotta be something that I can do.
There's gotta be.

You're on the toilet, why don't you
whip out your lady parts and tinkle?

You. This is all your fault.

I didn't hear you bellyaching when
you were watching 3-D beach babes.

Excuse me, but I am about to go to jail.

You know what happens
to slender fellas in jail?

They usually hang themselves
after their first shower.

But relax.

Rose ain't gonna tell nobody nothing.

Way I see it, you've got
as much on her as she's got on you.

You're right.
She's cheating on her husband.

Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

She tells on me, I tell on her.

Crisscross, apple sauce.

I got nothing to worry about.

Herky-jerky, where's your turkey?

- Why do you keep talking like that?
- I'm looking for a catch phrase.

- Zippy?
- Flimflam, you're in a jam.

Oh, hey.

- Somebody in there with you?
- Oh, no, no. Um, how can I help you?

Just brought your clean towels.

- What about my washcloths?
- I threw those away.

- Why?
- Do you really have to ask?

Miss you, kiss you, use a tissue.

You're awfully quiet tonight.

Now, don't look at me that way.

You knew the deal when we got married.

Uh-oh. Shh.

Who is it?

It's Alan. We need to talk.

Just a second.

Let's go, Rose. I haven't got all night.

What is wrong with you?

Manny is taking a nap on the deck.

Maybe I need to wake him up
and have a little talk with him.

About what?

You might be tempted to tell someone
about my little business venture.

- You mean your Ponzi scheme?
- Knock it off, Rose.

Unless you want me to tell your husband
you're having an affair with my brother.

You wouldn't.

Crisscross, apple sauce.

What?

Doesn't matter.

The point is, if you tell, I'll tell.

Go ahead. Tell him.

If my husband leaves me,
I'll still have Charlie.

But if I tell everyone what you've been
up to, what will you have?

Crap.

Oopsie-doopsie, watch your poopsie.

There's a bird on your husband's head.

Yeah. So?

Crap.

This is your husband?
This is Manny Quinn?

Oh, my God, Manny Quinn.

Your husband's a dummy.

To be fair, he wasn't the one
fooled by a mannequin.

What do you use
to get bird poop off a husband?

Charlie thinks you're actually married.

Uh, yeah, that's kind of the idea.

- I'm not gonna let you scam him.
- I understand.

What's that, Manny?
I hadn't even thought of that.

Thought of what?
What are you saying?

How much would you need
to pay back the money you stole?

I didn't steal, they invested.

- Fine. How much?
- Fifty thousand dollars.

Why don't you wait here
and I'll get my checkbook.

Oh, no, no... I am loyal to my brother.
You can't buy my silence with a check.

- You want cash?
- You have cash?

I mean, I won't betray Charlie.

You may have to kill him.

Well, hey, what are you still doing here?

I need my money back.

- Why?
- Just found out...

two of my teenage
granddaughters are pregnant.

- At the same time?
- By the same guy.

Long story short, I need cash, quick.

- Um, okay. How much are we talking?
- All of it.

- All of it?
- Is that a problem?

No, no, it's not a problem. Um...

If you want cash, you'll have to wait
till tomorrow so I can go to the bank.

- Tomorrow's fine.
- Good, good.

Of course, you're gonna lose
quite a bit by pulling out early.

Yeah, well, if Jimmy Lee had done
the same, I wouldn't need the money.

Okay, tomorrow.

Oh, boy.

Don't panic.

In the toaster, numbnuts.

Okay, Mr. Smart-Guy.

How do you suggest I pay off Berta?
I spent all the money.

- On what?
- Well, you know, clothing, jewelry...

electronics, little lipo.

Liposuction?

I had a bit of a muffin top.

You know, I actually feel a lot better
about myself now.

Okay, well, then you're gonna
have to get another investor.

- What about the goofy chick?
- Rose? She did offer me $50,000.

Why didn't you take it?

If I took it,
I would have to betray my brother.

Hey, Alan. Who are you talking to?

- Nobody. Want some toast?
- Maybe later.

Check it out.
Two first-class tickets to Paris.

We're going to Paris? Great idea.

Can we leave before the banks
open tomorrow?

What? Are you out of your mind?

I'm taking Rose. They have their own
Disneyland there and they serve wine.

But what about her husband?

I'm gonna ask her to leave him
and marry me.

Oh, gee, Charlie,
that may not be the best idea.

I don't recall asking for your opinion.

Hey, hey, I'm just looking out for you.

Do me a favor, a little less looking out,
little more moving out.

You're right. Screw him.

Let's go get cash from the crazy
chick who married the mannequin.

She's crazy? I'm the one talking
to a kitchen appliance.

Hey, look, I'm trapped in a toaster.

Wait, wait, I'm coming with you.

I think that's everything.

- What did you tell your husband?
- I didn't have to tell him anything.

He's in New York for a fashion show.

Perfect. So, what kind of clothes
does he design anyway?

- Men's sportswear, mostly.
- Anything I might like?

No, it's more the kind of stuff
Alan would wear.

Oh, so tacky.

You know, I think I left my raincoat
in the bedroom.

- I'll get it.
- Oh, thanks.

Uh-oh.

Whoa.

I guess the guy
brings his work home with him.

Yep. Tacky.

I got it.

Here is your $10,000. Hope it works out
with your granddaughters.

They're 15 years old and pregnant.

What should I look forward to,
the next season of Teen Mom?

And that is it.

Everybody is paid off.

But you're broke again.

But my conscience is clear.

Dynamite.

The rhyming thing
really wasn't working.

Leave me alone.
All you are is my dark side.

Fine, would you rather listen
to your light side?

- What are you talking about?
- There's more of us in here.

More?

Oh, really? That shirt with those pants?
What were you thinking?

Okay, who else you got?

Who else do you need?

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men, men, men, men âª

âª Men, men, men,
men, men, men, men. âª

Hello.

I'm Charlie's brother Alan.

I want to thank you all
for coming.

I know this is

a very sad day
for all of us.

Speak for yourself.

Okay.

Uh, I understand that some of
you have "mixed feelings."

Um... but I think
we can all agree

that Charlie lived life
to its fullest

and-and gave it
everything he had.

Gave me herpes.

Chlamydia.

Vaginal warts.

Excuse me, this is my dead
son we're talking about.

I loved him and I'm
devastated that he's gone,

leaving me with nothing but
my memories and my regrets

and the listing for his
beautiful beachfront

Malibu getaway
with three bedrooms

and three and
a half baths

and a beautiful
panoramic ocean view.

Help yourselves to brochures
out by the coffee urn.

Thank you, Mom.

Um, anyway...

Open house is Sunday,
1:00 to 5:00.

Okay.

Um, I'd like to take a moment
to talk about my brother,

um, and his incredible love
for life.

He also loved being spanked.

While wearing
my panties.

He used my panties to make tea.

M-My point is, um, that Charlie
lived life on his own terms

and-and never apologized
for who he was.

Yeah, blah,
blah, blah.

Why can't we
see the body?

Yeah, I didn't come all this way
to spit on a closed coffin.

Okay, I understand how you feel,

but unfortunately due to the
circumstances of his passing,

the remains aren't exactly...
spit-able.

I have a question.

O-Okay.

Uh, I wasn't planning on
doing a Q and A,

uh, but go ahead.

Thank you.

Charlie owes me $38,000
for some,

let's say, pharmaceuticals.

Who do I talk to about that?

Uh, well, I think
that's something

you'll have to discuss
with the lawyers.

Yeah.

I'd rather not involve the law.

And now, uh, I thought
we'd take this moment

to hear from the person who was
with Charlie at the end.

Thank you, Alan.

Charlie Harper was
the love of my life

and a wonderful, wonderful man.

Selfish pig.

Sure, our relationship had
its ups and downs

and the occasional
restraining order.

But at the end,

we ran away together to Paris,
where he asked me to marry him.

I said yes.

And the next few days
were the happiest of my life.

Nothing could spoil it.

Not even when I came home
from shopping

and found him taking a shower
with another woman.

That's our Charlie.

But I forgave him

because I loved him
unconditionally.

So you can imagine my horror
when, the very next day,

he slipped on the Metro platform

and fell in front of
an oncoming train.

Never cross a
crazy woman.

I just want you all to know
that Charlie didn't suffer.

His body just exploded
like a balloon full of meat.

Thank you.

I'm hungry.

Anyone else hungry?

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Charlie was the best boss
I ever had.

I needed a day off,
"Sure, Berta, no problem."

I needed a couple

extra bucks,

"Sure, Berta, no problem."

All he ever asked in return
was clean sheets

and hosing the vomit off the
occasional drug-addled hooker.

What a beautiful story.

Can I count on you to keep
the house clean till I sell it?

Can I count on you
to keep paying me?

Well, there's virtually no money
in Charlie's estate,

but I'll be happy to pay you
once the house sells.

Then that's when I'll clean it.

I still don't see
why we have to sell.

I mean, he left it to me.

Obviously, he wanted me
to have it.

Can you make
the mortgage payments?

No.

Can you pay the property tax?

Not per se.

But I was kind of hoping
you'd help out.

I mean, after all, your grandson
lives here part-time.

Good job raising him.

Uh, darling, I can't afford
to maintain my house

and your house
at the same time.

But you're my mommy.

Good job raising him.

Once I sell this place,
you can come live with me.

But why would I have to?

I mean, won't I get
a lot of money from the sale?

Oh, please. Charlie had
three mortgages on this place.

Once we deduct closing costs
and escrow fees

and my commission,
you'll be lucky to break even.

Wait a minute, you're planning
to take a commission?

She doesn't work for free.

Why should I?

Don't think those silent ones
are fooling anybody.

âª Men. âª

Hi. I'm here
for the open house.

Of course. Come right in.

Thank you.

Three bedrooms,
three and a half baths,

60 feet of prime
Malibu oceanfront.

Wait a minute, I
know this place.

This is Charlie Harper's place,
right?

It was.

Then I can't buy it.

Uh...

What? Why?

Bad memories.

Charlie and I had this

drunken threesome with a crazy
chick right on this couch.

Sounds like a good memory.

Yeah, well,
unfortunately she passed out

and Charlie and I
kept going without her.

Bad memory.

Oh, the feng shui is great.

I mean, the place just
oozes positive energy.

It's not practical.

The commute downtown
would kill me.

Don't worry, sweetie.

Just let the universe provide.

The universe doesn't provide,
I provide.

I bust my ass 80 hours a week.

Uh-oh.

Sounds like somebody
needs to meditate.

Uh-oh.

Sounds like somebody needs
to file for divorce.

Really?

You want to play that card?

'Cause I will take you and
your uptight bourgeois family

for every penny you've got.

Bye-bye!

Bye-bye!

What a fun couple.

âª Men. âª

Sorry, the open
house is over.

I got a package
for Alan Harper.

Oh, uh, that's me.

Sign here.

Ooh, how exciting.

Wonder what it is.

It's from a crematorium,

so that kind of
narrows it down.

That's, uh,
that's my brother.

Berta,
Charlie's here!

Thank you.

Enjoy.

Well...

here we are, buddy.

Just like old times, huh?

I'm talking and you're
in a bottle ignoring me.

I, uh, I wanted to tell you,
uh, that I loved you,

and I will miss you,

and I will always be grateful
for you taking Jake and me in,

letting us live here
all these years.

So, now the question is...

what do we do with you?

I know what you said
you wanted, but...

I really don't think
Pamela Anderson will agree

to swallow your ashes.

Um, I-I could take you with me
to live at Mom's,

but that's how
horror movies start.

Hey.

Maybe I could sprinkle you
on the beach.

I mean, it's simple,
it's dignified,

and pretty girls
covered with oil

will be sitting on you all day.

Kind of like your life.

Except for the dignified part.

All right.

Well...

I guess now is
as good a time as any.

I ain't cleaning him up.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Can I use your phone?

Sure.

I guess.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I was just trying
to drown myself.

Wait, you-you tried
to commit suicide?

Yeah. But I had no idea that
the water would be that cold.

Suppose I could've
worn a wet suit,

but who tries to commit suicide
in a wet suit, right?

That phone right there?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Thank you.

Uh, you got a towel?

Oh, sure.

Thanks.

Hi. It's me.

I want you to know that I just
flung myself in the ocean

'cause I can't live without you.

No, I'm not calling you
from the ocean.

Because it was cold.

I don't...
I'm in some guy's house.

Um, Alan Harper.

I am in Alan
Harper's house.

How about it?
Will you take me back?

Are you sure?

You heard what I said
about the ocean, right?

Okay, fine.
I'll stop bothering you.

But I want you to know that I
will love you forever and ever.

Really?

That bothers you?

Okay. Bye.

You got a wet suit?

Oh, come on.
It... it can't be that bad.

It could be.
You don't know.

No, no, I do.

Come on. Come on.
Sit down. Sit down.

Listen.

I have been
where you are--

uh, rejected,
friendless, broke.

I'm not broke.

I'm worth, like,
a billion dollars.

Beg pardon?

1.3 is what her lawyer says,
but I would give up every penny

if she would take me back.

No, no, no.
You don't want to do that.

Uh... I think you can find a lot
of girls for way less money.

I don't want other girls.

I want Bridget.

Right. Right.

Um, just to clarify, um,

did you say "billion"
with a "buh?"

Listen, trust me.

Money does not
buy happiness.

I wouldn't know.
I've never had either.

Come on.
You're doing all right.

You're living in
a beach house in Malibu.

I have to sell it.

And it's not even mine;
it's his.

His?

That's my dead brother.

Oh.

I'm sorry I made you spill him.

That's okay. That's okay.

I'll DustBust him later.

You know what?

I'll get out of your way.

Thank you for letting me
use your phone.

Wait, hang on.
You sure you're okay?

Yeah. I'm just going to go back
to my hotel room

and update my Facebook status
to "not dead yet."

Wait, wait, wait. I...
I just went to one funeral.

I-I don't want to be involved
in another one.

Why don't you and I go out
and have a drink and talk?

About what?

Oh, I don't know.

The weather, politics.

Why somebody would want
to kill themselves

when they have
a billion freaking dollars.

Come on.

We'll, uh, put your clothes
in the dryer.

All right.

Oh, by the way...

I'm Walden.
Walden Schmidt.

Well, it's nice to meet
you, Walden Schmidt.

Oh. Oh, sure. I suppose
there's no reason

you can't undress right
here in the living room.

Oh, Skivvies coming off, too.

Okay. Okay, well, uh,
no body issues.

Lucky you. That's...

You're a good guy,
Alan Harper.

Oh, and he's a
hugger as well.

Okeydokey.

I'll be right back.

$1.3 billion,

and he's hung like an elephant.

âª Men. âª

Uh, I will have
an appletini.

Uh, and, um...?

Oh, uh, ginger
ale, please.

Really?

Fresh off
a suicide attempt,

and you're ordering
a ginger ale?

Yeah. I don't like
the taste of alcohol.

Nobody likes
the taste of alcohol.

We like the effects
of alcohol.

How it makes you feel tall,
good-looking and smart.

I am tall, good-looking
and smart.

Give him an appletini.

So, just out of curiosity,

how does someone get
to be worth so much money?

Oh, it's pretty
simple, really.

You ever hear of
Blungogo.com?

No.

And you never will,

because Microsoft
bought it from me

for $1.3 billion, and
then they bundled it

with their iPod
killer, the Zune.

Really?

I don't think it
came with my Zune.

You bought a Zune?

I had a coupon.

Cheers?

Oh. Cheers.

So, don't take this
the wrong way,

but I can't get the image
of your penis out of my mind.

Thank you.
That's very sweet.

âª Men. âª

You don't understand.

Bridget was my
high school sweetheart.

She was the love
of my life.

So why'd she leave you?

She catch you
with another woman?

- No.
- Sex no good?

No, it was great.

Are you sure?

'Cause sometimes they'll
tell you it's good,

and then you
find out later

they hated
the very touch of you.

Happened to a guy I know.

Well, she said that I was
emotionally immature.

You mean like
threatening suicide

unless she
takes you back?

That is not immature;
that's romantic.

Shut up.

Well, regardless, I-I know
what you're going through.

I mean, I married
my college sweetheart,

and when she divorced me,
I was devastated.

Why did she leave you?

Not a clue.
She's a crazy bitch.

The point is,
when life serves you

ball breakers
who rip your heart out,

you have to make...

ball breaker-ade.

Bridget never
broke my balls.

If anything,
she treated them

with tenderness
and respect.

Okay. Okay,
just for tonight,

will you... will you
forget about Bridget

and-and just try
to meet somebody new?

Like who?

I don't know.

How about...
how about her?

Really?

What would I say?

Uh, well, I would not lead
with the testicle anecdote.

Just... just say hi.

Okay.

Hi.

Hi.

- I'm Walden.
- Kelly.

So, Kelly...

My... wife dumped me,
and I want to die.

Oh, you poor baby.

I love her so much.

I... I don't...

Whew! I don't know...

if I can ever
love anyone

the way
that I love her.

That's the most beautiful thing
that I've ever heard.

Oh, it'll be okay.

Oh, God, I miss my wife!

âª Men. âª

Here is where I live.

Oh.

Nice.

Just me and my broken heart.

Alan, I... I think
I should go back to my hotel.

Are you nuts?

We're doing great.

This crap about loving
our exes is gold.

My brother
would be so proud.

What, the dude in
the DustBuster?

Yeah.

Ah. Uh, ladies, uh,
who's up for a libation?

- A what?
- Huh?

A... a drink-- alcohol.

- Sure.
- Great.

Oh. Be right back.

What's upstairs?

I don't know.
Probably a bedroom.

Why don't we
go find out?

Uh... okay.

Hey, shouldn't we tell Alan
where we're going?

No.
No.

Who's ready for margaritas?

Wow!

One at a time, ladies!
One at a time.

Well, this is depressingly
familiar.

Shut up.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Morning.

Oh, good golly.

Oh, uh, I'm Walden.

I'm impressed.

Oh. Alan.

Guess what.

I had sex with two girls
last night.

Great. Um, I masturbated
and cried myself to sleep.

I like my night better.

Oh, hey.

I dig your house,
so I'm going to buy it, okay?

Oh, okay.

Thanks.

You're the best.

Oh... ah.

Whoa.

Um, this is Walden.

He's going to
buy the house.

Welcome
to my humble abode.

I like him.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

I think
we can all agree

that Charlie lived life
to its fullest

and-and gave it
everything he had.

Gave me herpes.

I still don't see
why we have to sell.

I mean, he left it to me.

Obviously, he wanted me
to have it.

Can you make
the mortgage payments?

Not per say.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I was just trying
to drown myself.

You tried to
commit suicide?

Yeah.

I had no idea that the water
would be that cold.

I have been
where you are.

Uh, rejected,
friendless, broke.

I'm not broke.

I'm worth, like,
a billion dollars.

Beg pardon?

I just went to one funeral,

I don't want to be
involved in another one.

Why don't you and I go out
and have a drink and talk?

About what?

Why somebody would want

to kill themselves when they
have a billion freakin' dollars.

My...

wife dumped me,
and I want to die.

I don't know

if I can ever love anyone
the way that I love her.

Oh, it'll be okay.

Oh, God,
I miss my wife!

Guess what.

I had sex
with two girls last night.

Great. Um, I masturbated
and cried myself to sleep.

I like my night better.

Hey, I dig your house,
so I'm gonna buy it, okay?

O-Okay.

You're the best.

Oh. Ugh.

Whoa.

Um, this is Walden.

He's gonna buy
the house.

Welcome to
my humble abode.

âª Men. âª

So, what do think?

Will you stay on?

I'd consider it,
if the price is right.

I'd also consider
smothering you

with my sweet, sweet loving.

Well, money is not an issue.

Good to know.

Ka-ching.

What's down here?

Ice.

Mm. I like it better on top.

Me, too, puppy.

Anyway, what I
really need is

a housekeeper who's gonna
be here all the time.

'Cause, you know, I'm not very
good at king care of myself.

Oh, I can take care of you.

Oh, I can
take care of you.

Well, my car's all packed.

I guess I'm ready to go.

Great news, Alan.

Berta has agreed to be
my live-in housekeeper.

Really?

Yeah, he talked me into it.

I wonder what his sweat
tastes like.

Well, that is good news.

Uh, here are
a couple of sets of keys,

remotes for the garage,

and remember,
garbage pickup is on Tuesday.

Oh, you take care
of the garbage, right?

Nope.

Well, uh, guess it's time
for me to go.

Wait. Come here.

Give us a hug good-bye.

Seriously?

Come on, Alan.

Despite everything, you and me
have been like family.

Uh, I guess.

I'm taking
your room, Zippy.

Of course you are.

Well, see ya.

I'll walk you out.

I could bite that ass
like an apple.

Well, I hope you'll be
very happy here, Walden.

Thank you. I don't
know if I can be

happy anywhere
without my wife.

Oh, come on,
you're young, you're rich,

and you've got a face
that gives women an erection.

What about love?

What about commitment?

What about spending a lifetime
with your spiritual soul mate?

Hey, look, a peephole!

Hello!

Man, I love peepholes.

Well, you know what they say.

People who love peepholes...

are the luckiest people
in the world.

Okay, good luck.

Hey, thank you
for all your help and advice.

Oh, you're welcome.

Uh, and if you ever need
a friend to talk to man-to-man,

you know where to find me.

Your mommy's.

Only temporarily.

Okay.

Well, uh, if I left
anything here,

feel free to, you know, keep it,
throw it away, whatever.

Great. Bye.

Bye.

Bye!

Okay, Walden Schmidt.

It is time to start your new
life as a single man in Malibu.

Hello?

Dad?

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Why are you
unpacking?

Because you told me
I could stay here.

Temporarily.

Yeah, a few days,
a couple of weeks,

a month, tops.

Yeah, right.

Why can't you just stay
with your girlfriend?

Oh, oh, this isn't a very good
time for Lyndsey and I

to be moving in together.

Why not?

Well, she's going through

one of those phases where,
uh, the very touch of me

fills her with revulsion.

Um...

I-I'm thinking
it's premenopause.

Yes, I'm sure that's why.

Well, just so you know,

I'm not putting my life on hold
while you're here.

Oh, and I wouldn't
expect you to.

Just go on with your life.

Do whatever it is you would do,
as if I weren't here.

Well, I have a date tonight.

Oh, great.

We'll probably
wind up having sex.

Sure.

Rough sex.

Right.

So, stay away from my bedroom.

No problem.

Even if you hear me screaming.

Especially if I hear you
screaming.

Unless I'm repeatedly
screaming "umbrella."

U-Umbrella?

That's my safe word.

Sometimes they can't hear it
through the leather mask.

Most moms would've stopped with
"I have a date tonight."

âª Men. âª

Hey, Bridge, it's me again.

What is the name of
that shampoo that I use

that doesn't sting my eyes?

Baby shampoo?

Where do I get it?

Any supermarket.

That is remarkably convenient.

Oh, uh, while I have you
on the phone,

will you take me back?

Wow, it's like "no"
is your favorite word now.

Okay, whoa, don't hang up,
don't hang up.

Hey, uh, what is
the toilet paper that we use?

You know, the stuff that's
soft on my tushy like a cloud.

You grow up.

H-Hello?

Hey, Berta, will you
run to the supermarket

and get me baby shampoo?
Sure.

Then I'll sit in the tub
with you and wash your hair.

Oh, Berta.

I miss her so much.

Oh, hey.

Hey, everything's
gonna be all right.

Just wait and see.

I've never felt
so bad in my life.

And I never felt so good.

Don't!

Stop!

Don't!

Stop!

What are you doing?

I said don't stop!

I should be on the roof
with a rifle.

- Oh. Hey, Walden.
- Hey.

Uh, you left some books
in your room.

Oh, thank you.

Um, you didn't have to
drive all the way over here.

Is it really possible
to hypnotize a woman

and make her your slave?

Oh.

That was a, that was a
gag gift for my birthday.

What about Ten Minutes a Day
to Incredible Wealth?

Oh, good, that's
my poop book.

Um, I'd invite you in,

but my mom doesn't let
me have friends over.

That's cool.

Mm.

You want to go out
and maybe do something?

What do you
have in mind?

Umbrella!

Doesn't matter,
let's go.

Umbrella!
Umbrella! Umbr...

Nice car.

What is it?

It's an
electric Fisker.

State-of-the-art
lithium ion technology

supplemented with a
turbo-charged engine.

Solar panels
on the roof.

Oh, blue Volkswagen.

Punchbug!

So, how much does
something like this cost?

About a hundred grand.

It's great for the environment.

I don't know why anyone
would drive anything else.

Speaking for myself,
bone-crushing poverty

is something of
a stumbling block.

Maybe you could lease.

I got a confession
to make, Alan.

Me, too.

The hypnotism book
wasn't really a gift.

I really came over because...

I was kind of lonely.

Oh, sure, sure.

I been there.

A lot.

In fact, I'm there now.

I've never really spent
much time alone.

I've been with Bridget
since high school.

Mm. High school sweethearts.

When I was in high school,

I was dating a poster
of Molly Ringwald.

You know, back then,
she was crazy in love with me.

I didn't even have
any money then.

Oh, I'm sure
she still loves you.

No.

She's changed.

Her heart has become
cold and angry.

Um, you're starting to go
a little fast there, buddy.

I mean, who just wakes up
one day and all of a sudden

decides they don't want
to be married anymore?

Uh, well, actually,
it only seems that way.

In my experience,

they've been mulling it over
for quite a while.

Uh, you know, the speed limit
is 35, and you're going,

oh, oh, 80.

I mean, what ever happened
to till death do us part?

Yeah, who died?

Not you, not her.

Oh, good golly, 95.

Whoa! Whoa!

This thing really
takes the corners.

I love her, Alan,
and I want her back.

Well, I know you do.

Oh, 103, Walden, 103.

Life is not worth
living without Bridget!

Truck, truck, truck!

It hurts so much, I
can't take it anymore!

Umbrella!

âª Men. âª

I'm sorry I scared you
by driving so fast.

That's okay.

I'm sorry I peed a little
on your seat.

Where are we?

We're going
to my house.

I got to talk Bridget
into taking me back.

Oh, no.

No, no, bad idea.

When a woman says she doesn't
want you, begging does not help.

And I say this having spent
more time on my knees

than any straight man
in America.

What is this,
a gated community?

No, it's just
my house.

Wow.

Instead of going
to chiropractor school,

I should have
married a billionaire.

Next time,
you'll know.

What are you doing here, Walden?

I just want to talk to you.

Go away or I'll call the police!

"Go away
or I'll call the police."

Man, that takes me back.

Um, what do you say
I drive us home?

How about that?

I'm not giving up that easy.

Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

W-Where...?

You heard what she said
about the police, right?

I'm going to get my wife back.
Come on.

Come on?
What's my part in this?

I need you to help me
over the gate.

O-Okay.

Again, voice of experience here.

Criminal trespass usually ends
with her dating the cop.

Will you just come on.

Here, give me a hand.

Here, let me go.
I'm going this way.

I got it.
I got it.

Okay, okay.
I got it.

Good luck.

Come on.

Again, come on?

I may need your help
getting in a window.

Oh, terrific.

Now I'm Spider-Man.

I got you.

Walden, do not make me
turn that gate on.

W-What does that mean?

Turn the gate on?

Don't worry, she's bluffing.

I still have
a buzzing in my ears.

I can't hear you, I have
a buzzing in my ears.

God, Walden, what
is wrong with you?

Well, if loving you
is wrong, then...

I am wrong.

It's true.

He talks about you all the time.

Okay, I expect
this kind of thing from him;

he has the emotional maturity
of a 12-year-old.

What's your excuse?

Uh, I live at my mom's,
and she's having

rough sex with a stranger, and
I had to get out of the house.

Honey, I just don't understand
why we can't work things out.

Okay, I'll tell you again.

Oh, this part
is never good.

I'm tired of living
with a child.

I'm tired of being
more of a mother than a wife.

Whoa, oh,
whoa, whoa.

You are not more of
a mother than a wife.

Really? Who picks out
your clothes?

You.

Who tells you
when to go to sleep?

You.

Who does all the cooking
and cleaning around here?

The cooking and the
cleaning ladies.

Before we were rich!

You.

Look, Walden, you're a sweet guy

and I'll always love you,

but I can't live
with Peter Pan anymore.

Uh, now, now,
to be fair,

uh, Peter Pan
didn't want to grow up.

Uh, from what I understand,
Walden's just never had to.

Sorry.

Seemed important
up here.

Down here,
not so much.

Bridget, believe
me, I can grow up.

Oh, please.

At least give me
a chance to try.

I gave you 15 years.

It's over!

Okay.

Can I at least play

a little Donkey Kong
with Alan before I go?

Are you insane?!

Get out!

Oh, yeah, fine,
I'm insane!

Come on, Alan!

Thank you for the water
and the...

Hold on.

Let's go.

Where does she get off
calling me a child?

Um, you seem a little upset;
maybe I should drive us. Um...

She is a stupid-head.

Oh, oh, white Volkswagen.
Huh?

Huh? Come on.

Oh, wait, wait,
I've got an idea.

Why don't we stop,
have a drink and talk about it.

Drinking is not the answer.

No, stopping is the answer!

Oh, dear God,
where is that toilet paper?!

Oh, boy.

Alan?

Yeah?

Why are you
lying on top of me?

'Cause I didn't want
to be on the bottom?

I think we're naked.

Yeah. You can ignore
what's going on down there.

That was a
morning reflex.

Could you get it
off of me, please?

Absolutely.
Absolutely.

Do you remember anything?

Uh...

we went to a liquor store,
and then we came back here.

Then we went
skinny dipping.

Right, right.

Whose idea was that?

Mine.

Shh.

âª Men. âª

Okay, your pants
are clean.

Thank you.

adult diapers.

Look, Walden was driving
ridiculously fast,

and-and I have
a nervous bladder.

Save it, Zippy.

This is not my first
pee stain rodeo with you.

Hi. Is Charlie here?

Oh, God, another one.

You deal with it.

Um, hi.
I'm-I'm Charlie's brother Alan.

I'm Penelope.

Is he here?

Uh, maybe you better sit down.

Is-Is everything okay?

Um, no.

Penelope, the-the thing is,
uh, Charlie passed away.

What?

It was very sudden.

Oh, my God.

I'm sorry, he was just
such a terrific guy.

I can't believe he's gone.

Hey, what's going on?

Hello, I'm Penelope.

Hi. I'm Walden.

What are you crying about?

I have no idea.

Don't worry about me,
I'll let myself out.

You smell good.

Oh, thank you.
It's baby shampoo.

"What are you crying about?"

"I have no idea."

Oh, Bridget. Hi.

Hi.

I came to talk to Walden.

Really?

Yeah, I think maybe

I've been a little
hard on him.

Well, um...

Bridget?

Hey.

Walden?

Look who came
to talk to you, Walden.

Your wife.

You're married?

Oh, yeah, long time married.

Uh, they just met.

This is Penelope, my girlfriend.

What?
Shut up and walk.

I'm-I'm glad you came.

Come, sit-sit down.

When I saw you with that girl,

I thought that maybe
she was with you.

You're kidding, right?

I mean, come on,
Alan's the ladies' man.

He's a total
pickup artist.

Come on!

Charlie's dead,
Walden's married,

what's wrong
with me?!

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

So, I was thinking

we could go out to
dinner sometime.

Let me prove that
I can change.

I can be a grown-up.

I guess I owe you
that much.

Sweet!

Sorry to interrupt.

I was just on a little jog
with my lady.

Uh, I'll, uh,

get out of your way.

Uh, hold on.

I'm-I'm going to say
good-bye to my guest,

because that's the grown-up
thing to do, right?

Alan, thank you.

You saved my
butt back there.

Oh, I'm glad
things are working out.

I owe you big-time.

If there's anything
that you need,

any way I can help you,
you just let me know.

Well, since you mention it,
you could do me a little favor.

Name it.

Well, really uncomfortable

living at my mom's.

Um, do you think I could
stay here for a few days

till I find my own place?

No problem.

Few days, couple weeks.

Yeah, done.

Month, tops.

Whatever.

Great, great. Thanks.

And, uh, and don't worry,

I'm not one
to overstay my welcome.

Cool.

I'm back.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on...
Two and a Half Men...

Great news, Alan.

Berta has agreed to be

my live-in housekeeper.

Yeah, he talked me into it.

I wonder what his sweat
tastes like.

Time for me to go.
(chuckles)

Wait.
Come here.

Give us a hug goodbye.

I'm taking your room, Zippy.

You saved my
butt back there.

I owe you big-time.

If there's anything
that you need,

any way I can help you...

Well, really uncomfortable
living at my mom's.

Um, do you think I could
stay here for a few days

while I find my own place?

Yeah, no problem.

I'm back.

# Men. #

# When Alan comes marching
home again, hurrah, hurrah #

# We'll give him a hearty
welcome then, hurrah, hurrah. #

Hello, room.

Do you miss me?

Whoa!
Whoa!

What the hell are
you doing here?

I live here.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Walden said I could stay
for a couple of days.

You don't stay
anywhere for a couple of days.

Besides, this is my room now.

It was my room first.

Walden!

Why don't you just
take Jake's room?

Why don't I just rip your arm
off and slap you silly with it?

Oh, hey.

What's going on?

Did you tell him
he could stay here?

Yeah, just for
a couple days.

Okay, I've got to explain
something to you.

This guy is like genital herpes.

Once you got 'em,

you got 'em for life.

Now, th-that's not very fair.

How long did you tell
your brother you'd be here?

You know what, I'll just
move over to Jake's room.

Good idea, go to Jake's room.

Wait, why are we calling it
Jake's room?

Herpes has a kid.

Herpes Junior?

Hey. What you doing?

I'm building
a neural metric backend

for a social media aggregator.

If I nail it,
I can revolutionize

the entire
online entertainment sector.

Ooh. Neural metrics.

Cool.

You know, I buy
all my underwear online.

Add to cart.

(doorbell rings)

Oh, no, no, no. Let
me get that, boss.

"Add to cart."

That's adorable.

What are you
guys doing here?

It's your weekend
to have custody of this.

Hello.

Uh, Judith, I told
you I'm a guest here.

I can't just bring my
kid over without asking.

So ask. Bye.

Uh, Judith, Judith.

Wait, Judith!

She left the car running, Dad.

All right, all right.

Uh, all right,
don't move.

Don't-Don't come
in the house.

Just stand
right here.

But I really
have to...

Okay, how am I gonna play this?

Dishonestly.

Hey, Walden...

Good news. I just got
an e-mail from Bridget,

we're going out
to dinner tonight.

Oh, dating the ex.

Always good news.

Uh, hey, speaking of broken
families and good news, uh,

do you remember
my son Jake?

Uh, yeah.

Nice kid with the big head?

Mm.

Yeah, I like him.

Uh, and he
liked you, too.

Uh, so much so that he decided
to drop by and say hi.

Where is he?

Oh, he's waiting outside.

I told him you can't just

come over
to someone's house unannounced.

Why not?
I do it all the time.

Yeah, but you're a
handsome billionaire.

People are always
happy to see you.

I also told him there was
no way he could sleep over.

Why not?

You wouldn't mind?

Why would I mind?

(urine sloshing)

(zipper closing)
Hey.

No reason.

He's a great kid.

# Men. #

Okay, you need to keep in mind
that it's not like the old days.

I am a guest here.

You mean like the old days
when you were a guest here?

I was not a guest.

Right, 'cause guests
eventually leave.

Charlie was my brother;
he loved having me here.

Wow. Denial isn't just
a river in South America.

Africa.

What about it?

Never mind.

Just-Just behave yourself
while you're here.

Fine. Can I have
some privacy now?

Oh, well, that actually
leads me to another thing.

Um, see, Berta's got
my room now, so...

No!

Yes.
No!

It's just temporary.

I'm not sleeping with my dad!

When you go to college,
you'll have a roommate.

Yeah, but it won't be you.

Come on, it'll be just like
that time we went camping.

I was ten and it was
the worst weekend of my life.

Hey, I didn't enjoy it either,

but it's a father-son memory
we'll share forever!

What are we gonna do,
sleep on the same bed?

No, I'll get the air
mattress out of the garage.

That you'll sleep on.

No! No!
Yes! Yes!

All right, all right!
Forget about it.

Look, okay, I will
pack up our stuff

and we will go back
to Grandma's.

Fine.

(scoffs)

Fine.

Okay.

Don't come crying to me when
she starts driving you crazy.

I won't.

And remember, at Grandma's,

you got to pee sitting down
so there's no splatter.

I'll manage,
and that's how you pee anyway.

I'm not bluffing, Jake.

I believe you.

All right, I'll sleep
on the stupid air mattress!

Good.

Three more seconds
and I would've folded.

Damn!

# Men. #

So, where do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

What do you mean?

You always pick the restaurant.

Well, who says the man's
supposed to pick the restaurant?

Well, that's a stupid rule.

Okay, yeah,
I'll-I'll pick a restaurant.

Okay, bye.

Hey, Jake, do you know
a romantic restaurant

I can take a girl to dinner?

How about Souplantation?

Is it good?

Are you kidding?

All-you-can-eat salad,
soup, pasta.

I am in.

Dude.

What?

That's my sandwich.

It's delicious.

(sighs)

So what's your deal?

Huh?

I'm 17. I don't think
I have a deal yet.

Ah, come on.

Everybody's got a deal.

Your deal is you got no deal.

Cool.

I'm a man without a deal.

What are you, like, a high
school senior or something?

Well, I should be,
but they got this dumb rule

that you have to pass
every single course.

I think five out of seven
is plenty, don't you?

Heck yeah.

In eighth grade,
I flunked all my courses.

Really?

Yeah.

My mom had me evaluated.

Turns out, I was just bored

'cause I was too smart
for all the classes.

Huh. Maybe that's my problem.

I'm too freakin' smart.

Ow!

I'm sorry.

I just think we need
to establish some boundaries.

Hey, don't make hitting
your deal.

# Men. #

(wheezing)

(blowing)

Hey, Dad?

Hang on.

(panting)

(groans)

Didn't you used to have
a bicycle pump?

Yeah, and I also
used to have my own room.

What do you
want, Jake?

Okay, so you know how
you're worried that 'cause I get

bad grades in high school
that I'm not gonna be able

to get into college and then
find a job to support myself?

That pretty much
sums it up, yeah.

Well, it turns out, I get
bad grades 'cause I'm too smart.

Too smart?

Yeah.

So I'm gonna forget college,

drop out of high school
and start my own business.

Hold on, hold on.

You're too smart?

Yep. Walden and me
have that in common.

Walden and I
have that in common.

No offense, Dad, but I don't
think you're that smart.

So, you're saying you want
to drop out of high school?

Why not?

Did you know that Walden made

his first million
before he was 19?

How many zeros
in a million, Jake?

M- I-L-L-I-O-N.

One.

Okay, okay, Jake,
listen carefully.

You are not
dropping out of high school.

But...

No, you're not a genius,

you're not a prodigy.

Nice.

My own father
doesn't think I'm special.

Oh.

(chuckles)

On the contrary.

Your father thinks
you're very special.

Of course, I'm the dummy
sleeping on the floor.

(mattress farting, hissing)

# Men. #

# Men. #

(knocking)

Come in.

Got a minute?

Sure.

Hey, I'm getting dressed
for my dinner with Bridget.

How do I look?

Your face should be
on gay money.

Listen, um...

You say something to my son
about quitting high school

and starting a business?

Oh, yeah, I told him
that's what I did.

Hey, what do you think
about a hat?

The only reason
to wear a hat on date

is if you're hiding a bald spot.

Oh.

For your next date.

Thank you.

So you really quit high school?

Mmm, no.

I skipped high school.

I quit MIT.

Oh, okay. See, there's
the misunderstanding.

Jake has a hard time
spelling MIT.

Oh. Well, then, he really
shouldn't quit school.

Hey, check it out.

My socks match my sneakers.

But your sneakers
don't match each other.

Oh...

Bridget used to pick out
all my outfits.

I can see why you miss her.

Well, uh, thank you for
clearing the Jake stuff up.

Yeah, no problem.

Uh, and, uh, going forward,

keep in mind that kids like him
are looking for role models,

so you have to be careful
around them.

Yeah, sure.
Although, truth to tell,

unless he sees you passed out
in a pool of vomit

with a tattooed prostitute,
you're going to be

an improvement
in the role model department.

Hey, Alan?
Yeah?

You got a lot of experience
with women, right?

A lot? (chuckles)
I don't know.

You know, I've, uh, been
around the block a few times.

Did a little dance,
made a little love,

got down tonight
on several occasions.

Um, why do you ask?

What can I do to convince
Bridget to take me back?

Oh.

(sighs)

Walden, Walden,
Walden, Walden.

Come sit.

Really? I got to sit?

A woman's heart is a deep
and mysterious place,

almost impossible
to reach.

Much like the G-spot.

Although at least we know
the heart, in fact, exists.

Okay, is that it?
Can I stand up now?

Oh, no. H-hang on.
Hang on.

When that heart closes
itself to a man--

and in my experience,
it inevitably does--

the only way to reopen it
is to allow time to pass.

That way, the
woman can reflect

on how much she
misses her man.

And that's worked
for you?

Oh, yeah.

There are quite a
few ladies out there

currently reflecting on how
much they miss Alan Harper.

Good luck.

Should've asked the kid.

# Men. #

Unbelievable.

You don't like it.

No, no, I blame myself.

I trusted you to make
a simple dinner reservation.

Uh, don't blame me;
blame Jake.

Who's Jake?

He's some kid without a deal.

Besides, does it matter
where we eat

as long as we're
with each other?

(loud clinking)

I got to pee!

Okay, bon appÃ©tit.

I got to pee!

Don't you move.

Hello!

(laughs)

She's cute.

You know, it's not too late.

We could still have a kid.

We already do.

I'm looking at him.

Oh, come on.
That's not fair.

Ah, hot soup!

Hot soup. (groans)

Thank you.
Look, Walden,

I agreed to have dinner with you

because I care about you,
but I just...

Are we going to have sex later?

(sighs)
Let me finish.

But no.

Aw.

The thing is,
even though I care about you,

this marriage is over.

I don't want to get
a divorce.

Why do we got to get a divorce?

Because I have grown up

and you are still the same guy
you were at 19.

No, that is not true.

I got a lot more money now.

Money isn't the point.

I got lawyers,
I got accountants,

I got my own
charitable foundation.

It's not about what you have;
it's about who you are.

Oh.

Well, I'm pretty much
the same guy.

What I want, what I need,
is a partner in life.

A grown-up, mature,
responsible adult.

What, and you don't think
that's me?

No, I don't.

And you don't think
I can change?

No, I don't.
But what if I can?

But you can't.
Can, too.

Just eat your dinner.

Ugh.

This blows.

I know, but it's something

we're both just going
to have to accept.

How's your beach house?

It's okay.

But I miss you.

I miss you, too, sometimes.

Really?

Walden, we were together
for 15 years.

Those feelings
don't just go away.

(laughing)

Hey, be cool.

So, uh, you really still have
feelings for me?

Of course I do.
Oh.

(laughing)

Hey.

Big girls don't throw food.

Trust me, I can change.

I really can.

(laughs)

All right, that's it.
Eat lettuce!

Walden!
What? She started it.

Whoa! No pasta.

I call no pasta.

(laughing)

Oh, it is on!

Oh, yeah.

And she got some...
Here it comes.

Here it comes.
Here it comes.

(whooping)

# Men. #

(doorbell rings)

Berta, can you
get the door?

I'm off the clock, Zippy.

What clock?
You're a live-in.

And I'm livin'.

You know you took
the wrong brother, right?

Judith, what are
you doing here?

Why did you tell Jake
he could quit school?

I didn't.

Well, then, where
did he get the idea?

Walden. He told him
about how when he quit

he made hundreds of
millions of dollars,

and now Jake thinks
he can do it, too.

Terrific.
And I thought your brother

was a horrible influence.

Don't speak ill
of the dead.

But you're right-- he was
a terrible human being.

Hey, who's at
the... Whoops!

You come back
here, young man!

He's not coming back, is he?

I wouldn't.

Hey.

Walden, I want a word with you.

Walden, you remember
Judith. Bye.

You're Alan's ex, right?

Yes, and Jake's mother.

And you and I need
to discuss how...

I just had dinner
with my ex.

Well, that's very
nice. Anyway...

She's not my ex yet,
but she's going to be.

I'm sorry.

She hates me,
but I'm still in love with her.

Well, I'm sure you'll find
somebody else.

Since we were teenagers,
she's been the only one.

You were high school
sweethearts?

Yeah.

That is so romantic.

And I blew it again tonight.

Oh. Hey, come on now.

It... it'll be okay.

No, it'll never be okay.

She's my soul mate.

Oh, you poor,
sweet man.

Who smells like ranch dressing
and fettuccine alfredo.

Have you ever loved
anyone like that?

No.

Don't, 'cause it
hurts too much.

Oh, I wish there was
something I could do.

Like what?

Oh, yeah,
I'm so quitting high school.

# Men. #

# Men. #

For the last time, Jake,

you're not dropping out
of high school.

What if I can convince Mom
to let me?

(laughs) Sure.

If your mother says it's okay,
you can have my blessing.

Cool.

And while I'm at it,
I'll buy you a car.

Oh, no, no, a space ship.

Car's fine.

Good night, Jake.

Good night, Dad.

(passing gas)

That...
that was the air mattress.

Okay.

(passing gas)

That was me.

(panting)

Holy moly.

What got into
you tonight?

You know,
besides moi.

Shh. Don't talk.

Okay.

(sighs)

How would you feel
about growing a beard?

Wouldn't that
scratch your face?

Yeah.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

I don't want to get a divorce.

Why we got to get a divorce?

Because I have grown up

and you are still
the same guy you were at 19.

No, that is not true.

I got a lot more money now.

Not about what you have;
it's about who you are.

Oh.

Well, I'm pretty much
the same guy.

Great news, Alan.

Berta has agreed to be
my live-in housekeeper.

Yeah, he talked me into it.

I wonder what his sweat
tastes like.

Time for me to go.

Wait.

Come here.

Give us a hug good-bye.

I'm taking your room, Zippy.

You saved my
butt back there.

I owe you big time.

If there is anything
that you need,

any way I can help you...

Well, really uncomfortable
living at my mom's.

Um, do you think I could
stay here for a few days

till I find my own place?

Yeah, no problem.

I'm back.

Hello, room.

Did you miss me?

Whoa!
Whoa!

What the hell are
you doing here?

I live here. What the hell
are you doing here?

Um, see, Berta's got
my room now, so...

- No.
- Yes.

- No.
- It's just temporary.

I'm not sleeping with my dad.

What are we going to do,
sleep on the same bed?

No, I'll get the air
mattress out of the garage.

- That you'll sleep on.
- No.

- Yes. Yes!
- No.

âª Men. âª

Good morning.

Morning.

Where you been?

Little power walk
on the beach.

Got to tell you, Zip,

I can see why your
brother couldn't get you

out of this house with
the jaws of life.

Malibu is the
greatest place

to wake up in
the morning.

I'm glad you're enjoying
my room.

Alan, I say
this with love.

It was never
your room.

Morning.

Ah... did I miss
our power walk?

I tried to cuddle you awake,

but you weren't interested.
Oh.

So, Alan, how's
the house hunting coming?

Oh, still looking.
Uh, not a lot available.

Maybe that's 'cause you're
looking in the sports section.

Well, don't worry.

You can stay here as
long as you need to.

Aw!

Oh, just a... a few more days.

Maybe a week tops.

Aw.

Hey, uh, listen, Walden,
um, while I am here,

I was wondering
how you would feel

about me having
an overnight guest.

Aw.

I thought you
were the overnight guest.

Your wit is only exceeded
by your generosity.

Um, the thing is,

I'm having dinner tonight
with this woman

I used to be
in a relationship with.

And I don't know how things
are going to play out,

but if they go well,
I'd like to bring her back here

and, uh, you know...

reconcile.

Is she homeless, too?

Oh, oh, no, no, it-it's just
that she has a teenage son,

and I'm not really keen
on him hearing us, you know...

reconcile.

But it's okay
for me to hear you?

Oh, don't worry, we'll be quiet.

And quick.

It's true.
That's why she calls me Zippy.

I guess it's okay.

I sure wish I could reconcile
with Bridget.

Oh, give her some time.

Took Lyndsey months
to forgive me.

What'd she have
to forgive you for?

Oh... I, uh...
I called her a slut

because, uh, I thought she
was sleeping with my brother,

uh, and I, uh... I accidentally
burned down her house.

Well, not in that order.

Anyway, thanks so much.

He is going to move out
at some point, right?

You are so cute.

I was so sorry to hear
about your brother.

Yeah, yeah, very sad.

He fell in front of a train?

Uh, fell, pushed, jumped.

Whatever the verb, the end
result was Charlie tartare.

That's horrible.

Yeah.

And we had to sell
the house in Malibu.

So where are you living?

The house in Malibu.

Wait, what?

Oh, it's actually
a funny story.

Um, the fellow
who bought it

is this incredibly
rich Internet guy

who's going through
a bad divorce,

and he's lonely,
he needs a friend,

so he asked me to stick
around for a while.

What's the funny part?

He actually thinks I'm
going to leave someday.

So, uh, how's things?
How's Eldridge?

Let's not ruin the evening
by talking about our children.

Agreed.

I have missed you.

I've missed you, too.

Can you ever forgive me
for being such an idiot?

Let's not ruin the evening

by talking about what
an idiot you were.

Good idea.

You know, I haven't slept with
anybody since we broke up.

How about you?

You know what?

Let's not ruin the evening
by talking.

âª Men. âª

I got it.

Hello, little girl.

Hi, big daddy.
You got everything?

Hell, yeah.

Beer, bucket of drumsticks

and nine magic fingers.

Let's go.

Uh, Berta?

What's going on?

What's it look like?

I'm going to get drunk,
eat some chicken

and rock this
old man's world.

I got ten fingers
and a billion dollars,

and this guy's getting
more action than me.

What now, Walden?

Nothing.
I just wanted to say hi.

Sweetheart, listen to me.

We're getting divorced.

You need to get some friends,
get a life.

I don't want friends.
I don't want a life.

I just want you.

What... what are you
doing anyway?

Why... why are those people
wearing masks?

I'm at a charity event
for people without faces.

Are you at an orgy?

An orgy?

Don't be ridiculous.

What kind of charity
has an orgy?

Bye.

You know, a real gentleman

would've taken his poop
before he came over.

Hello!

Oh, I'm sorry. I-I didn't
know you were still up.

You must be Walden.
I'm Lyndsey.

Oh. Hi.

Okay, uh,
everybody's met.

Time to hit
the old sackaroo.

Don't be rude, Alan.

So, I understand you're going
through a tough divorce.

Yeah, it's tough for me.

She's breezing through it
with naked, faceless people.

Have you guys tried to work
things out, go to therapy?

I offered.
She's not interested.

Well, that's all you
can do-- make the offer.

Lyndsey?

Hang on.

So what, you're
just sitting around

feeling sorry
for yourself?

No. Sometimes I lay down.

Sometimes I curl up in a ball.

See, he's fine.

Listen to me.

We just met,
we don't know each other,

but you obviously have a lot
going for you.

You're tall,
good-looking,

very successful.

Believe me,
women settle for a lot less.

And thank God for that.

You need to get out there
and find somebody

who appreciates
all that you have to offer.

I don't want anybody else.

That's just because you haven't
found that special someone.

Believe me, somewhere out there
is the perfect girl for you.

Who knows?

She could be sitting
right in front of you.

Gee, I'd like to believe that.

So would I.

You know... you know,
Lyndsey's right.

You need to go out
and find Ms. Right.

I mean, in fact, you should
get started immediately.

Now?

No, I was just gonna
curl up in a ball.

Oh, come on. There's a great,
big, wide world out there

full of beautiful,
exciting, sexy people.

Where am I going to find them,
a bar?

I am not going to a bar.

Hey, if you're
looking for honey,

you got to go
where the bees are.

Forget it.

I am not going to a bar.

Hey, slick.

Where do you keep the plunger?

I am going to a bar.

âª Men. âª

Whoa.

Hi-ho, Silver.

I didn't hurt you,
did I?

A little, but I only
need the one ball.

Boy, you really seemed
like a different woman.

Well, you seemed
like a different man.

Hey, Alan?

Speak of the devil.

Hey. Am I interrupting?

No. Come in.

I just wanted to tell you
that I found her.

Found who?

Ms. Right.

Really?

At a bar at... 12:30
on a Wednesday night?

Is she on a leash?

Woof.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Isn't that the girl
who almost married your brother?

Yep.

Didn't she go to jail

for being some kind
of con artist?

Yep.

Doesn't it strike you

as an amazing coincidence

that she just ran
into Walden?

Nope.

You have to warn him
before he gets in too deep.

Sounds like he's
already in too deep.

Who's my hungry boy?

Me.

Who's my naughty boy?

Me.

Who's going to get their bottom
spanked after breakfast?

You.

You are so smart.

Open.

Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.

No, wait, Alan,
come back.

We're just having
breakfast.

Scrambled eggs and tongue.
Nice.

Hey, Alan, I want
to thank you.

If you hadn't made me
go out last night,

I would have never
met Courtney.

You're welcome, but I have
a feeling one way or another

she would have found you.

Oh, wait, hey, you know
what would be fun?

Whatever it is, I'll do it.

You are something else.

No, Walden, what
would be fun?

Oh, right.

What I was gonna say is,
why don't you and Lyndsey

and me and Courtney
all go out for dinner?

Oh, gee, I'd have
to check with Lyndsey.

Oh, come on, man, like
a big fancy dinner.

It's sort of short notice.

My treat.
We'll be there.

Alan, do you want to watch
me and Walden having sex?

No, not particularly.

Then you'd better
get out quick.

Hot diggity,
that feels good!

I can't believe she's using
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.

âª Men. âª

Hello? Dad?

Oh, yay.

Hey, Courtney.

Jake, it's so good to see you.

You, too.

Oh, you've grown.

No, that's just my cell phone.

Jake, what
are you doing here?

I just, uh...

came by to...

What?

Look, could you do me a favor
and give us some privacy?

Yeah, sure.
Can I have a good-bye hug?

Jake, go.

Way to block me, Dad.

So, Courtney.

So, Alan.

Where's Walden?

He's upstairs taking a nap.

Recharge the batteries?

The batteries are fine.

It's the flashlight
that needs a rest.

What can I do for you?

I want you to leave
Walden alone.

He's not ready
for someone like you.

Someone like me?

What ever do you mean?

Someone who's creating
a lifestyle

from finding wealthy men

and sponging off them
as much as they can.

Gee, Alan, that sounds
a lot like you.

What ever do you mean?

Eight years living
off your brother,

sleeping on
his fold-out couch.

Oh, leave it to you to
spin it so I look bad.

See you at dinner, Alan.

Oh, I will see you at dinner
all right, young lady.

âª Men. âª

Ugh, gristle.

Aw, here honey, let me cut
that fat away for you.

Thank you.

Bit of a fatty
piece here myself.

Yeah, so?

Oh, you got a little schmutz.

Thank you.

So, looks like you two guys
hit it off pretty quick.

What's the point
of going slow?

When it's right,
it's right.

- And it is right, right?
- Right.

Hey, I finished my beans.
Can I have dessert?

I am dessert.

Thank you.

Hey.

- Hmm?
- You know what would be cool?

What?
Move in with me.

Whoa, slow down, Walden.

Yeah, slow down, Walden.
You just met her last night.

Yeah, but I want to be
with her all the time.

Oh, baby, that is so sweet,
but is there even room for me?

What about Alan?

Yeah, what about Alan?

But he's moving
out, right?

Right.

I don't know. I'm not
really the kind of girl

who just moves in with
a guy after one night.

Please.

Okay.

Well, I guess I need to
find a new place to live.

Yeah, good luck with that.

âª Men. âª

Morning, Alan.

Morning.

Where's your little girlfriend?

She couldn't sleep,
so she went home.

What was the problem?

I think it was hearing the third

"Hot diggity, that feels good!"

Oh, yeah, number three
was a well-timed ice cube.

You think you've beaten me,
don't you?

Alan, it was never a contest.

Of the two of us,
only I can bring the "diggity."

Don't be so sure of yourself.

I may have a final card to play.

Well, unless that card
is a vagina in your pocket,

I'm not particularly
worried.

Oh, thanks for
coming, Bridget.

Well, you said Walden
was in trouble.

Hi, I'm the trouble
Walden's been in. Repeatedly.

Uh, Courtney, this is
Walden's wife Bridget.

Bridget, this is the "lad""
I was telling you about.

Bridget?

What are you doing here?

Well, Alan called
and told me

that you were doing
something stupid.

And I just met her.

She's just sorry

she threw you out,
but it's too late now,

- isn't it, baby?
- Really?

You're sorry
you threw me out?

Who cares?
Come upstairs.

Walden, just because
I can't live with you anymore,

doesn't mean that I want you

to be taken to the cleaners
by Botox Barbie here.

Don't listen to her.
Come upstairs.

Walden, if you go with her,
I will never talk to you again.

Why don't both you broads
hold out a treat and whistle

and we'll see which
one he goes to.

Boy, this is a toughie.

I really love having
a life with you.

Sharing my hopes

and dreams.

But I also really love

burying my head in your breasts
and going.

Honey, it's not
about the sex.

It's not about
your money.

I want to be with you.

I want to take care of you.

Oh, that's a good answer.

Bridget?

We have a winner!

Courtney, do you think that your
deep feelings for my husband

can in any way be affected

by a cashier's check
for $50,000?

$50,000?

You actually think
that you can buy me off?

Your real name is Sylvia Fishman
and you're wanted

in three states for fraud,
forgery and money laundering.

Bye, Walden.
It was fun.

Aw, darn.

I was really looking forward
to more diggity.

If Bridget will write me
a check like that,

I'll diggity
your brains out.

I'll diggity you for free.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

How you doing?

Let this be
a warning to you, Alan.

There are women out there
that will be nice to you

just to get to your money.

Thanks.

But that's not very high
on my list of concerns.

I just feel so stupid.

Oh, hey. Don't sell
yourself short.

I'm sure she was also attracted
to your chiseled good looks,

youthful stamina
and freakishly large penis.

Thanks.
That makes me feel better.

I'm glad, 'cause it makes me
feel like hanging myself.

So how'd you leave
things with Bridget?

Pretty much the same place.

She still wants
a divorce.

Oh, I'm sorry.

But she obviously
still cares about you.

I mean, a lot of people
would have used

the money she
gave Courtney for--

I don't know--
medical insurance, a new car,

maybe a college prep tutor
for their idiot son.

You can have
all those things, Alan.

I can?

Sure. You just have
to make more money.

Right.

Duh.

Hey, thanks for calling Bridget.

Oh, no problem.

No, you really had my back.

Oh, that's what
friends do.

Well, I want you to know
that you have

a home here as long as you want.

Really?

Because I am looking
for a place.

No, I want...
I want you to stay.

I like having
somebody here I can trust.

Well, if it's
what you want.

Ah, son of a bitch.

I knew you'd
find a way

to weasel your
way back in.

I'm out of here.

Well, you're not
quitting, are you?

Nah, I'm moving
back home.

I'll see
you Monday.

Wow.

Looks like I get to take
my old room back, huh?

Hey, whatever
you want, buddy.

Just make sure the
nine-fingered man is gone.

How about that?

For once, things actually
work out well for old Alan.

.......... ********** ..........

# Men. #

Ready, sweetheart?

LYNDSEY:
Almost.

Okay.

Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

(belches)

Oh, dinner's sitting
a little heavy.

Well, maybe I can help you
work it off.

Yeah, about that--

honey, would you mind terribly
if we just go to sleep?

I'm so full and bloated
from that dinner,

it'd be like sticking
a pin in a balloon.

Can we not call it a pin?

I'm sorry.

I just don't think
I'd enjoy sex tonight.

Since when is that
a requirement?

(chuckling)

But seriously, it's fine.

It's no problem.

Thank you.

Ugh.

Well, actually, it is a
little bit of problem.

What's that?

Well, uh, based
on past history--

um, expensive dinner,
drinks, valet parking--

um, I thought

we would probably
be fooling around tonight.

Uh, and-and-and with that
in mind,

uh, about 20 minutes ago,
I popped a little blue pill

to ensure that, uh,

when you were ready, so was I.

Of course, uh, now I'm ready
and you're not,

a situation they didn't really
cover in those commercials.

Oh, Alan.

No, that's okay. It's okay.

It's just kind of a shame
to waste them.

I mean, they-they are
kind of pricey,

even if they're expired ones
from Mexico.

If I give you $20,
will you let me go to sleep?

Oh, don't be silly.

I don't want your money.
(sighs)

But there are...

other ways you
could reimburse me

that wouldn't require a lot
of effort on your part.

Should've taken the 20 bucks.

ALAN:
Oh, hey.

Oh, hey, Alan.

Want some whiskey?

I thought you
didn't like to drink.

I don't.

I'm trying to learn.

(groans)

I'm getting better.

Is this about
your ex-wife?

No.
Walden.

Maybe.
Walden.

Yes.

(groans)

All right, all right.

Listen to me.

Alcohol is just a bandage
for your problems.

And I know this

because I used to live
with the Mummy.

Uh... come on.

We, uh... we got to get
your mind off of her.

Let's, uh...
let's watch some TV.

(sighs)

Bridget and I
used to watch TV.

That's the spirit.

Okay, let's see
what's on.

Oh. (chuckles)

Cinnamon's Buns.

"A medieval wench
falls for a bawdy baker.

Adult. 1992."

Ooh, a selection
from the classic era

of soft-core cable porn.

Or what I like to call
the winter bush years.

I haven't watched much
porn since college.

Yeah, me, neither.

When I see it now, I just
feel bad for the girls.

Yeah, yeah,
somebody's daughter. Shh.

MAN (over TV):
Are you ready to learn my craft?

Of course, Master Baker.

I am entirely in your hands.

This is not
historically accurate.

Medieval bakers did not
dress like Chef Boyardee.

Don't need the DVD
commentary here.

Sorry.

BAKER:
Now, Cinnamon,

take my frosting bag.

It's so big.

I can barely get
my hand around it.

Use both hands, m'lady.

It's well written.

Like this?

Now, squeeze,

and anoint thy muffins
with my frosting.

Boy, she looks
familiar.

Yeah, she does.

If I wasn't here,
would you be masturbating?

You kidding? I'd be done
and fixing a sandwich.

Master Baker,
whatever are you doing?

I'm going to put my
loaf in your oven.

(chuckling)

That's clever.

I don't know.

She looks like a younger version
of your girlfriend.

Lyndsey?
Uh-huh.

Oh, nah.

WOMAN:
Oh, oh, you're so masterful!

Kind of sounds like her, too.

Maybe.

Although I can't say
I've ever heard Lyndsey

use that particular phrase.

WOMAN:
Don't stop! I can't get enough!

Or that one.

Maybe if I heard her say,
"Damn it, get off my hair."

I don't know, Alan.

I think that's
your girlfriend.

No, no.

WOMAN:
Yes! Yes!

No. No.

Yes! Yes!

Oh, God! Oh, God!

Oh, God!

Boy, she's not
very convincing.

It is Lyndsey.

Okay, I'm going to go
upstairs and masturbate.

Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

You're... you're
going to go

pleasure yourself while you're
thinking about my girlfriend?

No, that'd be creepy.

I'm going to go pleasure myself

while I'm thinking
about my wife.

Wait. Your... your wife?
Seriously?

Yeah, what can I say?
I love Bridget,

and I think she's the sexiest
woman in the whole world.

Uh, you never fantasize
about anybody else?

Mmm, sometimes I imagine
she's twins.

Boo-ya!

I never even thought of my wife

when I was actually
having sex with my wife.

LYNDSEY (over TV):
Oh, Master Baker!

Boy, she never let me
do that to her.

Until now.

How's your day
looking? Busy?

Yeah. Busy.

Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

It's okay.
I did offer this morning.

Can't expect me to turn on
like a light switch

whenever the whim strikes you.

I'm not just a piece of meat,
you know.

You're kidding, right?

In the entire time
I've known you,

you've never once passed up
an opportunity for sex.

So as not to hurt your feelings,
sometimes my mouth says, "Yes,"

when my soul is screaming, "No""

Oh, please!

I can't even bend over
to take off my shoes

without you trying to mount me.

Hey, hey, that was an accident.

I was trying to walk and text.

You were texting,
"Here comes Mr. Pokey."

Morning.

Morning.
Morning.

We'll talk later.

About Mr. Pokey?

I was speaking to Lyndsey.

Sounds like a short
conversation.

I should have my own talk show.

Okay.

I've got to get to work.

I'll call you later?

If you want.
(sighs)

Bye, Berta.

You're an attractive woman.

You don't have to settle.

I mean, bye!

So, trouble in paradise?

Why on Earth do you think

I would share my problems
with you?

Oh, come on.

I may tease you now and then,
but that doesn't mean

that I don't care about you
as a human being.

All right.

What do you do when you're in

a relationship with someone
and, you know,

like all
relationships, it...

it has its ups
and downs, but...

generally, things are
going pretty good

until one day you discover

that they are not at all
who you thought they were?

And you don't know whether
to confront them about it or...

or pretend you don't know,

because the idea of being alone
is worse

than being with someone
who's deceived you.

Berta?

Hello?

BERTA:
Turns out I don't care.

Morning.

Morning.

Hey, I was thinking

about your girlfriend's
porno movie.

Me, too. What about it?

I want to learn to bake.

What?

I think it'd be fun.

You know, cookies and cupcakes,
pie, bread.

That's what you took
from watching two people

get it on
in a 16th century kitchen?

Well, I already know
how to have sex.

How do you make
buttermilk biscuits?

There's a mystery.

# Men. #

(knock at door)

Hey.

We need to talk.

Is everything okay?

Not really. Can I come in?

Sure.

What's going on?

Okay, I don't know
how to say this

except just to say it.

Oh, God, are
you still upset

about not getting
laid last night?

I'm still upset about not
getting laid in high school.

But that's not what
I want to talk about.

Um, last night,
after you went to sleep,

I turned on the TV
and stumbled on

a little motion picture
you appeared in.

(sighs)

You saw Cinnamon's Buns.

I saw Cinnamon's buns.
I saw Cinnamon's boobs.

I saw the little birthmark

on the inside
of Cinnamon's thigh.

Oh, God.

I mean, one minute
I-I'm dating

a soccer mom
from Sherman Oaks,

and the next minute
a porn star on Cinemax.

I'm not a porn star.

It was a little nudity.

And simulated sex.

Most of it.

Mo-most of it?

It was 20 years
ago, Alan.

I-I was young, stupid
and needed the money.

Well, why didn't you
tell me about it?

Oh, yeah, right.
Who wouldn't be

looking forward to
this conversation?

Well, I... I just feel
like such an idiot.

You feel like an idiot?

That casting director said he
could get me on Melrose Place.

I'm sorry.

I should have told you.

Any other secrets
you'd like to share with me?

Wait a second.

That's a two-way street.

Do you have any secrets
you want to tell me?

Me? I'm an open book.

Great. Chapter one.

What have you done
that you're ashamed of

and don't want anyone
to know about?

All right.

Um... when I was a little boy,

um, we had a dog
named Rusty,

um, who loved
peanut butter,

and, uh,

my brother, uh,
convinced me

that the best way
to feed him, uh,

was to, uh, uh, smear it
on my testicles.

Um...

No surprise, that dog
got very, very fat.

Um...

# Men. #

So, long story short,
I kissed the guy.

Because, you know,
how else would I know

whether or not I was gay?

What did you decide?

Well, I may love
Broadway musicals

and have an eye for fashion,
but that's where it stops.

Okay.

Let's recap the highlights.

You embezzled money
from your family,

you cheated on me
with an old girlfriend,

- Mm-hmm.
- you might be the father

of Judith and
Herb's baby,

you didn't tell
your late brother that the woman

he was chasing
was married to a mannequin

because she gave you $50,000
to keep it a secret.

And to top
it all off,

you gave the family dog
type 2 diabetes.

Oh, wait, one more thing.

Those diamond earrings I got you
for your birthday last year...

Let me guess.
They're not real.

Oh, no, they're real.

Uh, it's just, I kind of
stole them from my ex-wife.

You know, it really feels good
to get all this off my chest.

Okay, now your turn.

Probably shouldn't
have gone first.

# Men. #

# Men. #

(both laughing)

I'm so glad I learned to bake.

(laughing)

I'm so glad I'm baked.

(both laughing)

Hey.

What are you doing?

Oh... I'm baking brownies

and Berta is making my head
into a dreamcatcher.

I'm guessing
it was Berta's recipe.

It was!

But I did the baking, because
I am a master baker now.

(laughing)

That was funny.

You should be a guest
on my talk show.

I'm in.

Well, I have done something
incredibly stupid.

(whispers): Whatever you do,
don't say "what?"

What?

Lyndsey and I split up.

Oh, no. What happened?

Well, I made the mistake

of thinking
honesty is the best policy.

It is a good policy.

You know, another
good policy?

Give a hoot, don't pollute.

Zippy, the only time
in this world

you want to be
completely honest

is when the paramedics ask,
"What did you take?"

Two brownies
and a peach Snapple.

(laughing)

Snapple.

Snapple.

Okay.

Well, it's been real nice
talking at the two of you.

Where you going?

Uh, I need a little time
to be alone.

Okay.

G'bye-bye!

Man, it is hard when the person
you love doesn't love you back.

You don't have
to love me.

What?

You heard me,
Mr. Master Baker.

(both laughing)

# Men. #

Hi, Lyndsey.

Uh, it's me again.

Um, you don't
have to call me back,

but I just want you to know
that the only reason

that I was so honest with you

is because I care about you
and I trust you.

And a lot of those things
I've never told anybody,

and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't, either.

Um...

Especially the peanut butter
and the dog.

I got enough problems
without the ASPCA on my ass.

Um, anyway, I-I love you
and I miss you,

and I'm-I'm sorry
I made such a big deal

about your film career.

And for what it's worth,

um, I got a really big kick out
of seeing your original breasts.

Okay. Bye-bye.

Oh, she's gonna take
that last part wrong.

WALDEN: Hey, Alan, come
here quick!

Hurry!

Oh, what fresh hell is this?

ALL:
Surprise!

What's... what's going on?

It's a party to cheer you up.

Hey, Alan, say hello to

the Malibu College
beach volleyball team.

WOMEN:
Hi!

Hello.

Here, Alan, have a brownie.

They're mmm-mmm good.

Gee, Walden,
I really appreciate this,

but it's a little soon
for me to be partying.

I'm still hurting over Lyndsey.

But what am I gonna do with
all these incredibly hot girls

in bikinis
that are in the process

of getting stoned
out of their minds?

You're right,
I'm being thoughtless.

Alan's here!

# Men. #

(pop music playing)

(women giggling)

Do I look delicious?

'Cause I feel delicious.

(laughter)

Hey, Zip, I'm home.

Where you been?

Not a clue.

Whoa, I just saw a giant cat
holding a churro.

(doorbell rings)

If that's a giant mouse,
he's in big trouble.

Hey, it's Cinnamon!

Oh, God, you saw it, too?

Yeah, just a little.

Then I went upstairs
to masturbate.

Terrific.

Is Alan here?

Um...

I don't think so.

Let me check.

You said Alan, right?

Right.

Hold on.

All right, all right.

Ladies, have you
got your spoons?

Well, get rid of them.

We are eating freestyle!

(laughter)

Uh, excuse me.

Wait. Hey. Whoa!

Hey, what are
you doing?

You'll thank me later.

I can fly!

(dull thud)
Oh!

No, I can't.

You said Alan, right?

Right.

He's not here.

Are you having some sort
of a party in there?

Oh, no, it's just a bunch
of stoned girls dancing.

G'bye-bye!

Works better with an oven mitt.

Walden!

Oh, hey, Alan.

You look ucky.

Was that Lyndsey?

Yeah. I told her
you were not here.

I was not here because
you threw me off the deck.

No, I threw you off the deck
so you would not be here.

Wouldn't it have been easier
to just skip the throwing

and tell her I'm not here?

(chuckles)

Next time.

Oh! Hey.

Great news,
we got a cat.

# Men. #

# Men. #

So I thought about
it, and I decided

that I really can't fault
you for opening up to me.

I mean, every good relationship
has got to be based on honesty.

Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

By the way, where were you
when I came over to the house?

Well... honesty, right?

(chuckles):
Right.

I'm such a schmuck!

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

So you're not paying
any rent at all?

Walden doesn't want
my money, we're friends.

Wow. I can't wait till I grow up
and find a friend

of my own to live off of.

That's my dream for you.

Mail's here.

Whoa!

- Whoa!
- Whoa!

Hey!

Uh, Walden, are you
feeling okay?

Yeah, fine. Why?

Your junk's all over
the couch, dude.

Yeah, so?

It's my house, my couch,
my junk.

Fair point.

Remember, we're guests.

I thought we were friends.

What is this?

Package for "Alan Smith"
from "Penis Pump Industries."

Nobody here by that name.

I'll just... I'll take this
back to the post office.

Oh boy, perfect.

What?

It's my divorce papers
from Bridget.

Oh, oh, I'm sorry, man.

I remember getting
my divorce papers.

That was a sad,
sad day.

Remember, Jake?

I wasn't with you,
I was with Mom.

She had a party on a boat.

You gonna be okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I guess I knew it was coming.

Well, that's a very
healthy attitude.

Of course, I was hoping she'd
change her mind.

But if I had hope in one
hand and poop in the other,

guess which hand would be full?

The poop hand?

Bingo.

Yes.

Well, my marriage is over.

Big deal.

It's only the final death knell

of the most meaningful
relationship of my life.

Bong.

That was a knell.

But you're young.

I'm sure you'll find
someone else eventually.

Yeah, yeah, I mean, sure.

It's easy
to find a soul mate.

Heck, you practically trip over
them everywhere you turn.

Oh, look, a soul mate!

Oh, jeepers, there's
another soul mate!

Everywhere I look
it's another soul mate.

No, it's a great day.

It's just another fabulous day
in the life of Walden Schmidt.

Yah!

Dad?

Yeah?

Please tell me I'm not
done growing.

- Walden?
- Yeah?

What you doing?

If I'm going to forget Bridget
and start a new life,

I got to get rid
of the old one.

Uh-huh. So, uh,
so this is all...

Wedding photos
and love letters.

Right, right.

Oh, this is from
our second date.

"I am bananas over you."

Isn't that adorable?

Burn in Hell,
little monkey.

This-- wedding video.

Honeymoon video.

Oh, maybe I'll
keep that one.

Listen, I understand that you're
very upset right now,

but there may come a time

when you'll regret not having
some of this stuff.

You still have
your wedding photos?

Well, the half
that she gave me.

And by half, I mean
half of each picture.

Yeah, well, I don't want
any mementos.

In fact, I don't even want to
think about Bridget anymore.

I am wiping the hard drive.

Okay.
I'm rebooting the system.

Whatever makes you happy.
And to really get a clean start,

I'm going to sell this place
and move to New York.

With the possible
exception of that.

Why?

What do you mean why?

If you sell the place,
I wouldn't be able to live...

...with myself.

If I didn't encourage you
to reconsider,

and maybe talk
to a professional.

Like a shrink?

This could all be a sign
of clinical depression.

I guess you would know.

If you're interested, I could
recommend a good psychiatrist.

The one that my brother
used to go to.

Uh, your brother
ended up dead.

Well, yeah, that's
'cause a crazy woman

pushed him in front of a train.

You can't blame
his shrink for that.

If anything, blame
the crazy woman's shrink.

I guess I got nothing
to lose, huh?

I'm in.

Okay. Well, I'll go get
her number.

Geez, being a parasitic leech
is exhausting.

âª Men. âª

I'm sure you're aware that
depression is often the result

of repressed anger.

I'm not angry.

Well, I got to tell you, Walden,

burning all the mementos and
photographs from your marriage

can be construed
as an angry gesture.

That's not an angry gesture.
This is an angry gesture.

Arr!

That's a good one, too.

Why don't we put your marriage
on the back burner for now.

Let's talk about your childhood.

I had a very happy childhood.

Filled with wonderful memories.

Your parents still together?

No, and I don't want
to talk about it.

All right, fine.

My first childhood memory

was my father disappearing
when I was three.

He abandoned you
and your mother?

No, he disappeared.

He was an amateur magician
and it was his signature trick.

Oh.

And then when I was four,

he ran off with
a lady sword swallower.

At least that's what
my mother called her.

In retrospect, it might have
been a euphemism.

So what was your mother like?

Well, after Dad left,
she raised me by herself.

And how was that?

It was great.

She did everything for me.

And I always felt
safe with her.

That sounds wonderful.

It was.

And the saddest day of my life
was when it ended.

Why, what happened?

I got married.

Hello.

How did your wife
and your mother get along?

Not very well.
I don't know why, though.

Maybe it was just 'cause
they were so different.

I see.

Tell me more about your wife.

Bridget?

She's great.

She did everything for me.

And I always felt
very safe with her.

Oh, isn't that what I said
about my mother?

Oh, Walden, you went
and beat me to it.

I wonder if when we get
right down to it,

I married my mother.

And we're off.

What are we saying here?

That Bridget's right
and I am emotionally immature?

And all those years

I was treating her more
like a mother than a wife?

And how would that
make you feel if that were true?

That would make me feel
very angry.

And repressed anger is sometimes
the cause of...

Depression.

Ta-da.

Ta-da.

That's the last thing my dad
said before he disappeared.

Is that it? Am I cured?

Well, "cured" is one of those
laymen's terms

that we psychiatrists
try to avoid.

It hurts repeat business.

Do I need to come back?

I'm thinking three times
a week.

Well, I was going to leave town.

Well, then you have
a choice to make.

You can stay here and make
your problems go away,

or you can go away
with your problems.

Well, that is going in my book.

Okay, I need to know
one more thing.

When I was having sex
with my wife,

was I really having
sex with my mother?

I'm thinking double sessions.

Monday, Wednesday, Thursday?

What... You...
Um, you don't work on Fridays?

Not anymore.

I'll see you next week.

- Thank you, Dr. Freeman.
- You're welcome.

Oh, gosh. Okay, that's fine.

Bye-bye now.

Bye.

Hmm, maybe I'm not gay.

It turns out all these years,
I've been trying to duplicate

the good feelings I have for
my mother with my wife.

Oh, see, you lose me at good
feelings toward my mother.

Uh, I would like
a jumbo hot dog,

an extra large nachos
and a super slushee.

Um... you want anything?

No, I'm good.

Oh, come on, you
treated me to the movie,

let me treat you
to a snack.

Give my friend
a small popcorn.

Oh, God!

What?

It's my wife.

Oh... Wow!

That is one handsome
man she's with.

You think?

Oh, yeah.
He's gorgeous.

He's better looking
than me?

Well, it's apples
and oranges.

I mean, you're prettier,
but he's more...

What do I do here?

Well, the adult thing
would be to say hello

and meet her new fella,
but I'm a big believer in

yelling fire and escaping
in the confusion.

No, no. I'm going
to be a grownup.

Bridget!

Hiya! Over here!

Oh, Lord.

The closer he gets,
the better he looks.

Uh, Walden, this is Alex.
Alex, Walden.

Heard a lot about you.

Yeah? Did you hear
about my giant penis?

I smell smoke. Does anybody
else smell smoke?

Hey, Alan, Hi.

Hey.

Alan lives with Walden.

So, Alex...

What do you do?

I'm a cosmetic surgeon.

Really? Beverly Hills,
Botox, boobies?

More like Mogadishu,
cleft palates and burn victims.

He travels around the world
helping children in war zones.

Oh.

What are you guys,
like, on a date?

Walden, you knew eventually
I'd start seeing other people.

Nuh-uh.

Whatever.

Um, we should go.

Nice to meet you.

Really? What about
this was nice?

You didn't tell me
he turned gay.

He's gonna split
that little guy in half.

What a loser.

That'll be $47.28.

Oh, oh, damn.

I-I left my wallet in the car.

Uh, do you mind?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Oh, and throw in
some Twizzlers.

No, no, the big one.

âª Men. âª

I think you handled
that very well,

seeing Bridget
with another guy.

Another guy?

She's dating Conan
the Humanitarian.

Yeah, she kinda is.

It's like evolution,
you know?

He is to you as you are to me
as I am to a howler monkey.

That doesn't make me
feel better.

How do you think
it makes me feel?

You think
she's sleeping with him?

You kidding?

I'm surprised they
made it to the movies.

Oh, God.

Well, which raises
a certain question.

Um, your wife clearly attracts
some extraordinary men.

Of course she does.

Look at her.

I have.

Which brings me
to the question.

Uh, does she have some
sort of special powers?

You know, sexually?

What do you mean?

All right, I'll just come
straight out and say it.

Does she have
a magic vagina?

Like, can you pull
a rabbit out of it?

Never mind.

âª Men. âª

In retrospect,
maybe that wasn't the best movie

to see under the
circumstances.

Are you kidding me?
It was perfect.

Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl to a better guy,

boy kills himself.

Still, you got to
love Sandra Bullock.

- Here, take my keys.
- Why?

'Cause I'm going to get
dirty, stinking drunk.

Appletini.

Twice.

Two beers.

Whoa.

Check it out.

What?

Who's that remind you of?

Harry Potter?

Bridget.

Maybe a little. So?

So it's a sign.

Of what?

I don't know.

But I'm going to find out.

Hi, I'm Walden.

Danny.

Danny?

Short for Danielle.

My father wanted a girl.

It's nice
to meet you, Danny.

Let me save you some trouble.

I'm here with somebody.

Oh, yeah, of course.

A beautiful girl like you.

Bathroom's disgusting.

I had to do the
squat and hover.

At least you're not
peeing in a trough

with looky-loos on either side.

I'm Alan.

Kiki.

Oh, Kiki.

Short for...

K-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki.

Obviously, I'm gonna have
to spell it out for you guys.

Oh. Yeah, that certainly
clears things up.

What, you thought
we were hitting on you?

Maybe I have to
spell it out for you.

See?

My apologies.

I should've known by
looking at... him.

Uh, what was
that about?

Just work with me.

Still want to buy
our drinks?

Uh, sure.

Cheers.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

We're here, we're
queer, get used to it.

âª Men. âª

Oh, man, check this out.

Did you buy it together?

Oh, I wish.

Mr. Moneybags bought it.

I just make it a home.

Come on, Alan, let's go
get our guests a cocktail.

No offense.

Oh, cocktail.

All right,
what's the plan?

We gonna try
and get them blind drunk

and then flip them over
to our team?

What? No.

Don't worry, I'll take Danny.

You can have the hot one.

Well, first of all,
Danny is the hot one.

And second of all,
I'm not trying to flip anybody.

So what was kissing me about?

I like her.

And I want her
to feel comfortable

being around us.

So you used me.

Oh, come on, Alan.

She reminds me of Bridget.

Just help me out here.

Fine.

Oh, and I'm sorry
about kissing you.

No, it's all right.

If a man's gonna kiss me,

I prefer he looks like
the Son of God.

Thank you.

Now, are we
gonna do this?

I can't quit you.

âª Men. âª

So when did you
realize you were gay?

Oh, boy, that's a toughie.

Uh... I guess my first hint

was when I was, like,
five or six years old.

I used to make my G.I. Joe dolls

touch each other
inappropriately.

I used the horn
from my toy unicorn

to make a strap-on
for my Barbie.

Mom was not happy.

So when did
you come out?

It was later.

Uh, I was actually married.

Ooh, I bet that
didn't end well.

No.

But I still love her.

Even though, you know,
I'm playing for Team Penis now.

I am.

So, girlfriend,
scale of one to ten,

exactly how
gay are you?

I don't understand.

Well, you know, one being
"love the one you're with""

and ten being "touch me with
that thing and I'll cut it off""

Oh.

I still don't understand.

Are you exclusively
with girls?

Oh, no.
I like guys, too, sometimes.

Oh.

What a coincidence.

I happen to swing
both ways as well.

Really?

You don't look like it.

So how'd your wife react
when you told her you were gay?

She was very
understanding.

Very supportive.

That's nice.

Did I tell you we were

high school sweethearts?

Couple of times.

She was the love
of my life.

What about Alan?

Oh.

Yeah, you know,
I-I... love him.

Ah, God, I can't
do this anymore.

I'm on Team Vagina.

What?

I miss my wife, and I
wanted to hang out with you

because you
remind me of her.

Really?

I'm sorry I lied to you.

It's okay.

Come here, you poor baby.

Don't even think
about it, slick.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

So, if you're not gay,
what's the deal with Alan?

I'm not sure.

He claims to
be straight,

but his lips opened a
little when I kissed him.

Look at me, I'm
kissing a girl.

You're kissing
my girl!

Oh!

Oh, yeah, yuck.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa, whoa.

All right, calm down.

You can tell him
he can stop acting gay.

I'm not acting!

You really hit me hard.

I'm sorry. Let me see.

Okay, that was
uncalled for.

How could you?!
I'm sorry.

Don't blame her. I mean,
it was really...

Come on.

Bye, Walden.

Bye, Danny.
Bye, Kiki.

You have a really
lovely home.

Are you okay?

Well, I think she broke my nose,

but I almost turned
a lesbian, so...

I'm gonna count it as a win.

Attaboy.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

This was a nice idea.

I'm just trying
to cheer you up.

After all, you did get
your ass kicked by a girl.

Well, jury's out
that it was a "girl."

Uh, Walden, I-I've got
a confession to make.

Listen, I know you didn't
really forget your wallet.

Oh.

Okay, then I guess I have
two confessions to make.

Um, the other one is that
I-I've been a very selfish man.

How so?

Well, when you told me you
wanted to move to New York,

the only thing I
could think about

was me losing a
great place to live.

I was totally oblivious
to your feelings.

Don't worry about it.

No, no, no, I
need to say this.

You know, you're a great guy
and you deserve to be happy.

And if you have to
move, I'd understand.

But, uh, I want
you to know

I-I'd really,
really miss you.

I'd miss you, too.

But I'm not going anywhere.

Oh, you're not?

Nah, the shrink's right.

My problems are gonna
follow me wherever I go.

Besides... how could I
leave my best friend?

Aw...

I'm the luckiest
guy in the world.

Told you.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men... âª

I can't believe you've managed
to stay in this house.

You're like
a human barnacle.

Thanks, Mom.

Oh, I wasn't putting
you down, sweetheart.

It's good that you have a skill.

Did you come over for a reason,
or just to insult me?

The two aren't
mutually exclusive.

Mom.

Charlie's bank
contacted me.

Seems he had a secret
safe deposit box.

I knew it! I knew he had to
have something squirreled away.

Naturally, I went right
down there to check it out.

So what was in it? Cash?
Diamonds? Krugerrands?

Want to wipe your mouth?
You're drooling a little.

Sorry.

Actually, I was quite surprised
about what was in there.

- Oh, tell me, tell me!
- I'll do better than that.

Here.

I'm pretty sure he
wanted you to have this.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...

I knew you'd look out
for me, big bro.

What the hell is this?

Charlie's journal.

Charlie kept a journal?

Your brother was
a very complex man.

Perhaps he needed a safe place

to express his deepest emotions
and innermost thoughts,

or some such nonsense.

No. No cash, dear.
Already checked.

Of course not.

Why leave cash to your
impoverished brother

when you can leave your
alcohol-muddled thoughts?

Yay.

"To whom it may concern,

"if you are reading this it
means either my heart or lungs

"finally gave out.

"Or I rejected my new liver.

"Or my brother wouldn't
give me a piece of his.

"Or I choked on my own vomit,

"or somebody else's.

Or some crazy chick
pushed me in front of a bus..."

Ooh, so close.

Well, I hope reading it brings
you some comfort and closure.

Are you sure that's all that
was in the safe deposit box?

Yes.

So my brother went
out to the bank

and rented a safe deposit box
just for this journal?

It would appear so.

That makes no sense.

He intimated on many occasions

that he had some cash
stashed away for emergencies...

you know, like getting
a hooker after an earthquake.

Sweetheart, you have to
stop living in the past.

What's done is done.

Start looking forward.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Is that a new watch?

No.

You have your whole
life ahead of you,

and the fact is, you and I are
all that's left of this family.

Well...

you, me and Jake.

Hey, Grandma.

Whoa. Thought that was
coming out the other end.

You're right.
It's just you and me.

That looks like a man's Cartier.

It's a knock-off.

My point is,
with Charlie gone,

you and I have to learn
how to help and support

one another no matter what.

Gee, that would be great.

You were always
the good son.

Now you're my only son.

Oh, Mommy.

Oh, Walden!
How nice to see you!

It's a miracle
I'm not a transsexual

on Dancing With the Stars.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh âª
âª Men, men, men,  manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

I must tell you, Walden,
it's so nice to finally

see someone in this house

who surfs for something
other than porn.

Yeah, I love the ocean.

Just you alone with
your thoughts.

Time standing still, at peace
with the entire universe.

Plus, you can pee in it
and nobody knows.

Charming.

Actually, I'm glad
you stopped by.

Um... Do you know a good
interior designer?

As a matter of fact,
I know a great one.

Evelyn Harper Interior Design.

I thought you were
a real estate agent.

I am. I'm also
a building inspector,

mortgage broker, notary
public and a bail bondsman.

A bail bondsman?

Admittedly, that business has
slowed down since my son died.

But getting back to your needs,

what did you have in mind
in terms of redecorating?

I don't know.

I just, I just want my home
to reflect who I am.

And who are you?

I've got a buttload of money,
but I'm a pretty simple guy.

I... like people, but
I don't entertain a lot.

Oh, I'm not a neat freak,
but I don't like clutter.

Oh, you know, and the most
important thing is,

I want the house to use
green renewable energy,

you know, like solar
power and wind power...

Unless Brookstone or
somebody comes out with

a home nuclear reactor,
because, I mean, come on,

who wouldn't want one of those?

"A buttload of money""

You're in good hands.

This journal is unbelievable.

You aren't thinking of
publishing it, are you?

What? Of course not, why?

Well, I'm shoppin' around
my own Charlie memoir.

It's called Man Whore.

It's catchy.

But there was more to
Charlie than we thought.

I mean, listen to this.

"I just sent a girl home
who told me she loved me

"and I can't even
remember her name.

"What is wrong with me
that I just have

"anonymous drunken encounters
night after night?

"Do I drink to fill
the loneliness,

or to hide from the
horror I've become?"

You know, I feel awful that
I lived with him for so long

and I didn't recognize his pain.

"I remember, her name is Rachel!

"I feel better now.

I'll reward myself with some
cocaine and an Asian hooker."

So remember, the key to
balancing the equation

is to place coefficients
in front of each reactant

and product so that
all the atoms balance.

I bet you shower every day.

Jake, we're supposed
to be studying

for the chemistry mid-term.

I'd rather study our chemistry.

Lame.

Really? I thought it
was a "double intendo."

Hey, guys.

Whatcha studying?

Chemistry.

Cool.

Looks like you two
have a little chemistry.

That's so clever.

I'm Megan.

Oh, hi, Megan. It's nice
to meet you. I'm Walden.

Oh, are you the Walden
that bought the house?

Yeah, how many Waldens
have you met lately?

That's... that's so funny.

And I'm lame.

Well, it was nice to meet you.

I'll let you guys get
back to your "chemistry."

Bye, Walden!
It was nice meeting you too.

You know, if he hooks up
with you, he goes to jail.

I'd wait for him.

"Peed blood again this morning.

Should I be worried?"

As it turns out, no.

We have to get
rid of Walden.

- We do?
- Oh yeah, he's gotta go.

Does it occur to you
that this is his house

and if anybody goes,
it's gonna be us?

Actually, no.

What's the problem?

He's stealing my girlfriend.

Wait, I thought
she was your tutor.

Think about it, Dad.
Would I have asked for a tutor

if I didn't have a... what do
you call it, interior motive?

Go on.

She's only interested in
glomming onto Walden.

Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

I think my own mother likes
him more than she likes me.

Why would that
make me feel better?

I honestly don't know.

Is this what I have to
look forward to in life?

Always losing girls to
smarter, better-looking men?

Well, think of it this way:

you're carrying on a
proud family tradition.

Hello, dear.

What's all this?

Oh, didn't you know?

I'm helping young
Thor redecorate.

I hope that's
all you're doing.

Whatever do you mean?

He's tall, he's handsome,
he's vulnerable,

and you're old enough
to be his ancestor.

Relax, Alan.
The only thing I want

to pull out of that boy's
pants is his wallet.

You sure?

Believe me, I have
no ulterior motive.

I believe that's
"interior," Grandma.

You really should get that boy a
unicycle and some juggling pins.

Evelyn, cool, you're here.
Uh, could you come on up?

There's some things I want
you to do in my bedroom.

Give the customer
what he wants.

Okay, to start with,

I want grey Carrara
marble counters,

a steam shower...

oh, and can we get one of
those fancy Japanese toilets

that sprays water and
cleans your tushie?

With your money you could afford

an actual Japanese
person to do it.

See what you can find.

Okay, in here, I would like
to replace the bed frame,

the curtains, the dresser,

the end tables and the lamps.

All right.

What would you like
to replace them with?

Um...

A cooler bed frame,

cooler curtains, cooler dresser,

cooler end tables
and cooler lamps.

"Cooler." I'm on it.

Uh, now, would you
like to repaint?

Hey, can I have walls

that change color
depending on my mood?

No.

But we could paint them white

and get you an industrial
strength antidepressant.

That will work too.

Would you like to
keep the camera?

What camera?

Aw...

Awesome!

I'm on TV.

Hello!

I am so keeping that.

All right. Anything else?

Can I have a Jacuzzi
on the balcony?

'Cause I'm single now,
so I'm going to be

having sex with a lot of
women I haven't met yet.

Oh... I just got an idea!

Just out of curiosity, what kind
of woman are you attracted to?

There's my wife.

Oh, and there's women
who look like my wife.

That's very romantic.

Oh, and Ellen DeGeneres.

I don't know
what it is.

Whether it's the slacks
or the way she dances--

it's hot.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

You're up early.

Charlie's journal-- I
can't stop reading it.

Listen to this.

"My brother's kid
showed up today.

"He's kind of cute.

"No way he's really Alan's kid.

"And best of all,
he's smart as a whip.

I think he's got
a very bright future."

Oh, that just
breaks my heart.

Yeah.

We were all so young
and naive then.

Hey.

Hey.

What? I took a huge dump.

No way he's really my kid.

You look very pretty today.

Jake, I'm here
to study.

The test was yesterday.

I already failed.

Hey, guys.

Hey, Walden.

Here we go.

Whoa, Megan,
you look very pretty today.

Thanks.

You look pretty, too.

Thank you.

Where are you going?

Oh, I am going furniture
shopping with Jake's grandma.

Oh, I love furniture.

And grandmas.

Cool.

See ya.

See ya.

Okay, Megan,

I know what's going on here

and I really don't appreciate...

What's that about?

I don't know. I'm
just in the mood.

Okay.

Come on.

Okay.

Where are we going?

To your room.

Okay.

Hello, gorgeous.

Did you miss me?

'Cause I sure missed you.

Let me pull this thing
out of you.

Are you gonna turn your car off?

I did.

Might need service.

Sadly, that's where
I just came from.

You know what's great
about my electric car?

What?

I just turned it on.

Sweet.

So where you headed?

Um, I'm going
to pick up your mom.

We're going furniture shopping.

Okay, well, just
a little heads up

before you journey to
the caves of Mordor.

My mother has what
you might call

a, uh, proclivity
for younger men.

You mean she's like a cougar?

No, she's not
"like a cougar""

she's the mother
of all cougars.

So kind of an uber-cougar?

A super duper
uber-cougar.

You think a bit of better butter

would make
her bitter batter better?

What?

I just like saying that.

Walden, I'm
serious here.

Don't worry.

I'm not going to hook up
with your mom.

Yeah, if I had a dime for
every time I heard that,

I'd have $3.60.

And I know that doesn't
sound like a lot,

but it is 36 times.

That's a very weird thing
to keep track of.

I got a lot
of free time.

Trust me,
nothing's going to happen.

Okay. But try not to
hurt her feelings.

I mean, she may be a rapacious
sexual predator,

but she breaks
just like a little girl.

Understood.

Oh, hey, check it out.

I got voice control.

Lights on.

Radio on.

Back up.

Bye!

Well, you may not be
pretty or expensive,

but you get me
where I want to go.

Thank you for walking
me to my door.

You don't meet many
gentlemen nowadays.

You're welcome.

Is that a camera?

Hello!

Would you like to come in
for a drink before you go?

I don't know,
I should probably get going.

What's your hurry?

I just think that

we should keep
our relationship business

and not "biznass."

Oh, my goodness,
do you think I'm hitting on you?

W-Well, Alan did say
that you're an uber-cougar.

An uber-cougar?

A super duper uber-cougar.

Oh, my Lord.

Now, you listen to me,
young man.

My son has some serious issues.

And he tends to imagine things.

Believe me, I have no carnal
designs on you whatsoever.

Really?

For God's sake, Walden, I'm old
enough to be your mother.

Assuming a teenage pregnancy
of course.

Okay, sure.

I'll have a drink.

Are you going to tell Alan?

I'm going to tell everyone.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

"Alan moved in with
his girlfriend yesterday.

"How stupid is she?

"Oh, well, doesn't matter.

"Like a nonspecific
urinary infection,

"I'm sure he'll be back
before long.

"Truth be told,
I actually kind of miss

"the jug-eared freeloader.

How stupid am I?"

I don't believe it.

He loved me.

My brother loved me.

"Speaking of stupid,

"today I bought
a $100,000 Cartier watch.

"But I'm afraid to wear it,

so I'm gonna keep it
in my safe deposit box."

Son of a bitch!

That was, that was great.

Just-Just great.

Thank you so much.

Hey.

Hey. How'd it go
with my mom?

Fine, fine.

Just shopped for furniture.

Rugs, chairs and tables.

Nice.

Armoires, ottomans,

curtains, recliners,

love seats, throw pillows.

Okay, good night.

Oh, yeah, she did him.

Bye. Thanks again!

Hey, dude, how you doing?

Fantastic.

I love you, man.

Thanks.

What an affectionate family.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Morning.

Oh!

We got Maple Loops.

âª It's got oats and
corns and wheat âª

âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

âª It's Maple, maple,
maaaaple-icious! âª

Not a Maple Loops fan?

Oh. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

It's just, uh, threw me.

My, uh, my brother wrote
that jingle.

Get out of here- he
wrote Maple Loops?

Yeah, yeah,
he wrote lots of jingles-

Maple Loops,
Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets.

Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets?

âª From the magic
chocolate mountain âª

âª There's a secret
chocolate mine âª

âª With Granny's Big Fudge
Nuggets and a taste âª

âª That's oh so fine. âª

Wow, that's a good memory.

What else, what else?

Uh, well, there was
Hammerstein Beer.

âª The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein Beer âª

âª You like what you see,
you like what you hear âª

âª Grab a cold frosty
mug and pull her near âª

âª 'Cause the girls
look prettier âª

âª With Hammerstein Beer. âª

I had no idea your brother
was a freaking genius.

Well, he managed
to live 44 years

screwing everything that moved

without catching
a fatal venereal disease.

I...

I suppose there's a form
of genius in that.

You don't talk
about him very much.

Were you guys close?

Oh, yeah, we were,
we were inseparable.

I mean, why do you think
we lived together for so long?

Well, Berta says it's 'cause
you're a parasitic leech.

Admittedly, that was one
of his pet names for me,

but not true.

H- He loved me
and I loved him.

Oh, oh, you remember
this one? Uh...

âª Bad stuff grows
in the cracks of your toes âª

âª But nobody knows âª

âª Like Toezene. âª

Yeah, he said
I inspired that one.

You miss him, don't you?

Oh, of course I miss him.

I don't miss the smell of vomit
and lubricant in the morning...

but I-I do miss him.

Oh, what about this one?

âª I'm a pepper, he's a pepper âª

âª She's a pepper,
we're a pepper âª

âª Wouldn't you like
to be a pepper, too? âª

Uh, uh, no, Charlie
didn't do that one.

Oh, it's not that
catchy anyway.

âª It's got âª

âª Oats and corn and wheat âª

âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

âª It's... âª
âª It's... âª

âª Maple, maple,
maaaaple-icious! âª

Oh, sorry.
You were being sad, weren't you?

A little.

No, I-I can't tell you
how many hours

I watched my brother
playing this piano

or passed out under it.

One time I walked in and he was
having sex on top of it.

You can see
where the young lady's ass print

didn't quite wax out.

Maybe he should have
used a coaster.

New business idea-
ass coasters.

We're here to pick up a piano.

Oh, right, I, I forgot.

Uh...

Hold on.

So I imagine you're anxious

to get rid of some of these

painful memories.

No, are you kidding me?

I mean, this piano
is practically

all I have left of my brother,

except for, you
know, all the DNA

he left on the couch and...

on the floor and...

on the walls and on the stairs,

but I'm not going to clone him,
so the piano's pretty much it.

Okay, we got a problem then.
How so?

Well, you know
how I'm redecorating the house?

I donated the piano to a music
school for underprivileged kids.

What?

How could you be so selfish?

I'm sorry,
I'll just tell the kids

they have to keep practicing
on a painted slab of wood.

No, no, you're right.

This, this should go to someone

who will benefit from it.

You sure?

Yeah, yeah, let me,
uh, let me just get

Charlie's personal stuff
out of here.

Oh, oh, here's some of
his unfinished music.

Uh, panties.

Panties... panties.

Water pipe.

Oh, vibrator.

Oh.

So we're talking songs,

thongs, bongs, and schlongs.

If he had an autobiography,
that would be the title.

You know, there was a time

when I would have found
these things disgusting.

And now?

There's a certain wistfulness

mixed in with my revulsion.

Ready to go here?

Uh, yeah, come on in.

It's over here.

Thanks, we would've had
trouble finding it.

I changed my mind!

You can't have him!

Okay, okay, Alan, Alan,

what about the kids?

Screw 'em!

We're gonna need another minute.

Oh, Charlie, why?

Why, why, why, why, why?!

Why?!

White people.

âª Men. âª

Hello, Dad?

Right here.

Oh, hey.

Something's different.

Your uncle's piano is gone.

Oh, yeah.

Were we robbed?

Yes, we're the latest victims
of the piano thieves

that have been plaguing
the beach.

Damn, they got my good bong.

What?

Oh, man, that is so wrong.

No, it wasn't a robbery.

Walden's redecorating.

Cool.

You know, for some reason,

your uncle's death is
really starting to hit me.

I mean, I don't know
if I was in de...

What are you doing?

Um, a toast to Uncle Charlie?

Nice try.

You're not the only one
who misses him, you know.

Really?

You never talk about it.

I need a beer to loosen up.

Not gonna happen.

Now, come on, talk to me.

I don't know, Uncle Charlie
just never treated me

like I was some stupid kid.

That's nice.

He treated me
more like a stupid person.

Well, I know he loved you.

Then how come
he didn't leave me anything?

Well, you don't measure love
by things.

I disagree.

Nothing says "I love you"
like a Mercedes CL600.

Hey, the Mercedes was leased.

And is that all your uncle
meant to you- a nice car?

Of course not-
I learned a lot from him.

Like what?

Well, let's see.

If it doesn't fit,
don't force it.

It's always better
to say sorry afterwards

than ask for permission before.

And if it's burning,
bleeding, or oozing,

go to see a doctor ASAP.

Oh, God.

But probably the most
important thing I learned

is that by the time I'm his age,

I want to be married
and have a family.

Really?

Yeah, Uncle Charlie
was very lonely, Dad.

Yeah, yeah, he was.

And I don't want to be like him.

Well, good for you.

Of course, I don't want
to be like you either.

Even better.

By the way, do you have a number
for this Dr. Asap?

He's not listed anywhere.

What?

I mean, I don't need him
right now,

but I want to have him
on speed dial, so if I do,

I can get him
as soon as possible.

ASAP?

Yeah, him.

A- S-A-P?

I know how to spell it, Dad,
I'm not an idiot.

âª Men. âª

Can I get you
another appletini, Alan?

Yes.

Uh, no, uh,

make it a bourbon.

Since when
do you drink bourbon?

It's what my brother drank.

Yeah, but your brother
knew how to drink.

Hey, I watched him for years.

You don't think
I picked up a few things?

Maybe.

It certainly wasn't
women or checks.

Ah, there you are.

Oh, how'd you find me?

Well, you're depressed,

and when you're
depressed, you drink,

and when you drink,
you come here.

If you were a fat guy,
I would have gone

to where they serve pies.

Hi there.

What can I get you?

I will have a
ginger ale, please.

One ginger ale,
coming right up.

Uh, I-I'm still waiting
on that bourbon.

I've only got two hands.

Here you go.

Can I get you
anything else-

slice of lime, peanuts,
breakfast in bed?

Thank you, I'm good.

Oh, I'm betting you are.

Don't be clearing
your throat at me.

Here.

Thank you.

She's nice.

To you, sure.

You live in a world of nice.

That's because I'm
nice to people,

and they're nice back to me.

No, it's because you're tall,
rich, and good-looking.

And nice.

Oh, please, that had
nothing to do with it.

I mean, take my brother.

He wasn't nice,
but he had money and looks,

so he always got a free pass.

Men wanted to be him, and
women wanted to be with him.

Actually, a few of the men
wanted to be with him, too.

A couple of 'em
actually succeeded,

but that's a story
for another day.

Well, cheers.

Hi.

Who's your friend?

He's a bloodthirsty psychopath

with a panel van and a
rag soaked in chloroform.

Hi, I'm Alicia.

I'm Walden.

âª Men. âª

And then, after he
kills the women,

he peels off their faces

and uses them to make
hand puppets.

Good night, Alan.
Good night, Alan.

Okay, see you in the Dumpster.

Man.

I couldn't score a woman like
that if my semen cured cancer.

Aw, Charlie.

I'll bet
you're up there watching

and laughing your ass off.

You left a big hole
down here, buddy.

And a lot of little ones.

I- I never told you this while
you were still alive, but...

I would've given anything
to be like you.

Even for a day.

Hey there, big guy.

Where'd you come from?

Douglas!

Douglas, where are you, boy?

Up here.

Oh... pretty mommy.

There you are, Douglas.

I'm so sorry.
I hope he didn't bother you.

Oh, not at all.
This is my favorite kind of dog.

Oh, you like labs?

No, I like dogs

that fetch me beautiful women.

Cute.

Is this your house?

Uh, not exactly.

What do you mean?

I mean, after we fall in love

and get married, it'll be ours.

Wow, you don't waste
any time, do you?

Nope. When I see what I want,
I get right to the B.S.

I'm Melanie.

Melanie Laughlin.

Oh. Nice to meet you, Melanie.

I'm...

Charlie.

Charlie Harper.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

That was fun.

Yeah, it was.

You know, I was a little worried
I wasn't gonna be able

to get used to single life,

but this "casual sex
with no commitment" stuff

is kind of growing on me.

Wait, what?

Thank you for the intercourse.

Bye-bye.

Well, Mr. Penis is happy.

Time to take care
of Mr. Stomach.

Good morning.

Morning.

You are an incredible lover,
Charlie Harper.

I believe if a gal's worth
doing, she's worth doing well.

You're terrible.

Yes. I am.

Hey.

Can your dog hold
a video camera?

âª Men. âª

Berta, how do you feel
about casual sex?

I'm all for it.

Just let me finish the dishes

and run a comb through my hair.

Morning.

What are you doing?

Hair of the dog.

Oh.

Oh, that one's not dog.

Bye! Call me!

Oh.

I will!

As soon as I remember your name.

Who was that?

Oh, I just tapped

a little strange last night.

Which one did you tap?

I'll give you a hint.

I didn't do the dog
people style.

It's walking like Zippy, but it
sure ain't talking like Zippy.

Yeah. I don't know him
as well as you do.

Is he prone to having
mental breakdowns?

Prone, no.

Eligible, certainly.

âª Men. âª

Whoa, look who's getting busy.

Hey.

Mr. Harper,
we were just making out.

Yeah, we all know
what happens after making out.

Making in and out.

Listen up, grasshoppers.

You know how they say that
marijuana leads to harder drugs?

Well, the same thing
applies to the human tongue.

It leads to harder organs.

Now, if you are not careful,
you're gonna wake up one morning

with a big-headed
bun in the oven.

No offense, Charlie Brown.

I'm begging you, please leave.

Relax, I'm just
looking out for you.

Here, tell you what.

Take the young lady out
for a nice dinner, on me.

It's a dollar.

You're welcome!

âª Men. âª

I think we have a problem.

Your father?

Yeah.

He's acting like
my Uncle Charlie.

I mean, he's even dressing
like my Uncle Charlie.

The only thing left of my dad
is his cheapness.

Well, Jake,
he suffered a big loss.

People deal with that
in different ways.

I mean, I still haven't
processed the grief

over my marriage ending.

I'm... sure someday it'll hit me

that the most important person
in my life is gone.

My soul mate.

My best friend.

My lover.

In the meantime,
you just carry on.

And you to try to fill that void
by having casual drunk sex

with strange, hot women
that don't mind

if you dance around
in their panties.

Is everybody turning into
Uncle Charlie?

âª Men. âª

Ah, Cuban in one hand,

scotch in the other.

All I need is
a French chick in my lap

and I'm the
United-freakin'- Nations.

Got a minute?

Uh, pretty busy, but okay.

Thanks.

All right, look...

People are really
worried about you.

Hey, the only reason people
are worried about me is 'cause

they can't wrap their heads
around how cool I am.

Yeah, no, I don't
think that's it.

Look, I know you
miss your brother.

Miss my brother?

That parasitic leech.

Not likely.

Hey, you remember that
shrink that you sent me to?

Maybe you should go see her.

What for? I'm fine.

What's your name?

Charlie Harper.

You're not fine.

Well, I guess we'll have
to agree to disagree.

Okay.

I'll tell you what, why
don't you get some rest,

maybe lick your finger,
stick it in a light socket,

and we'll revisit
this in the morning.

You got it, big fella.

Who the hell was that?

âª Men. âª

âª It's got oats
and corn and wheat âª

âª It's the sweetest
breakfast treat âª

âª It's... âª

âª Maple, maple,
maaaaple-icious! âª

Uh, what are you doing in here?

What are you doing in here?

It's my shower!

Once again, agree to disagree.

Okay, listen...

Whoa! Nice penis!

You could paint a
face on that thing

and ride in the car pool lane.

Thank you.

Uh-oh, what's going
on down there?

Call the cops;
I've been robbed!

âª Men. âª

Great idea.

You and me, Vegas.

Yep.

I am gonna show you a good time.

They love me in Vegas.

I'm sure they do.

Trust me, the name Charlie
Harper opens a lot of doors.

And a lot of legs.

No kidding.

But be sure to wear a condom.

Not everything stays in Vegas.

Okay.

Well, here we are.

Really? This doesn't
look like the Bellagio.

It's the, uh, back entrance.

Ah, not the only back entrance
we'll be using this weekend.

Am I right? Up top.

Hello, Mr. Harper.

If you could just come with us.

Uh, don't forget my bags.

We'll be going to
the presidential suite.

Oh, yes, sir.

Slip 'em both a sawbuck.

I'll see you in the room.

Will do.

This way, Mr. Harper.

So who's playing the big room?

Celine? Elton?

I'm gonna want tickets- comped.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hello, concierge? Yes.

Um, this is Charlie Harper
in the presidential suite.

Uh, I'm gonna need
a bucket of ice,

a bottle of scotch
and two Asian hookers.

You know what, they're small.

Make it three.

Yes, thanks.

Winning.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

Oh, Charlie.

I would have given anything
to be like you.

Even for a day.

I'm Melanie.

Nice to meet you, Melanie.

I'm...

Charlie.

Charlie Harper.

Whoa. Look who's getting busy.

Hey.

He's acting like
my Uncle Charlie.

He's even dressing
like my Uncle Charlie.

People are really
worried about you.

The only reason people
are worried about me

is 'cause they can't wrap their
heads around how cool I am.

- I'm fine.
- What's your name?

- Charlie Harper.
- You're not fine.

I've got a great idea.

You and me, Vegas.

This doesn't look
like the Bellagio.

Uh, it's the, uh, back entrance.

Hello, Mr. Harper.

If you could,
just come with us.

Uh, don't forget my bags.

And we'll be going
to the presidential suite?

Oh, yes, sir.

Uh, I'm going to need
a bucket of ice,

a bottle of scotch
and two Asian hookers.

Yes. Thanks.

Winning.

âª Men. âª

Here you go,
Mr. Harper.

Now that you're leaving us,

you can have your belt
and shoelaces back.

Oh. Thank you.

But believe me,
there was never any possibility

I was going to hurt myself.

Yeah, well,
it only takes one whack job

hanging from the shower curtain
to ruin it for everybody.

I... I suppose.

And I guess I did lose it
for a little while there.

Lose it?

We had a pool on how
long it would take

to get you toilet
trained again.

Really?

Cost me 50 bucks.

And a pair of nice white shoes.

Sorry.

I tend to leak under pressure.

So you think
you're ready

to go back out
into the world?

Yeah. Yeah, I do.

I mean, I've, uh,
learned a lot about myself

in the last month, and I...
I now have the tools

to deal with life
on life's terms.

You know, a lot of people
say that,

but you'd be surprised
how another couple of weeks

of treatment can make
all the difference in the world.

You have another pool,
don't you?

Nothing personal.

Just trying to get even.

Sorry I couldn't be more help.

That's okay.

Got $100 says you'll be back
before Christmas.

Thanks for your support.

You really want to thank me,
stop taking your medication.

Or double up.

Either way, I'll have
a happy holiday.

Hope you weren't planning
on leaving

before you give
your old buddy Gary a hug.

Of course not.

I love you.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

Thanks for picking me up.

No problem.

So you're not
crazy anymore?

I was never
actually crazy.

Then why were you
in the nuthouse?

It's not a nuthouse;
it's a stress clinic.

What's the difference?

About $2,500 a week.

But the good news
is that I got a lot out of it.

I mean, I am ready to deal

with whatever life
throws at me, you know.

Full speed ahead.

Well, that's good, 'cause
I've got something

I want to talk
to you about.

Oh, anything.
Dad's here for you, pal.

Cool.

So remember Megan?

Oh, yeah, that was, uh,
your little girlfriend.

Uh, she's seems
like a great gal.

Well, I'm glad
you like her

'cause she's
kind of pregnant.

Kind of?

She's not showing yet.

She's still in
her first semester.

Oh, my God.

How-how...
how did this happen?

I mean, what about
our talks about, uh,

sexual responsibility
and-and using protection?

I can explain that.

Go ahead.

I was drunk.

Okay. Okay.

I have the tools.

And how do you propose
to take care of this child?

Oh, we got that
figured out.

First, we're going to
quit school and get jobs.

Okay, stop right there.

What jobs?

Advertising-- we're going
to teach the baby to talk

and put him
in E-Trade commercials.

You're joking.

No. We figure the baby they got
is probably getting pretty old.

What does your mother
think about this?

- She doesn't know.
- What?

I was hoping
you'd tell her.

Why do I have to tell her?

Because she already hates you

and she scares the crap
out of me.

Hey, there he is.

Welcome home, buddy.

Thank you.
I'm glad to be here.

Yeah. How you feeling?

Fine. Why are you
whispering?

Oh, I don't want
to startle you.

Walden, I'm okay.

Yeah, sure you are.

Hey, Walden,
guess what.

I'm going to be a dad.

Really?

Wow.

How you feel about
that, Grandpa?

Well, it's, uh, not something
I would have chosen

for him at this stage
of his life,

but he will continue
to have my love and support.

If it's a boy,
we're going to name him Frodo.

You're not making it
easy for me, pal.

You should have
used a condom.

Or you should have.

Hey, look who's back
from the loony bin.

It wasn't a loony bin;
it's a stress clinic.

Did they let you
keep your belt?

Uh, well...
Loony bin.

- There's your mail.
- Thank you.

Hey, Berta,
I'm going to be a dad.

What's funny?

From where you're
standing, nothing.

Did you tell
him your news?

Mmm, it'll keep.

Hey, open your mail.

Okay. Let's see.

Uh, bill, bill, jury duty,

bill.

Ooh! Oh, here we go.

My refund from the IRS.

Ooh.
Whew!

Just in time
what with all these bills.

Might want to set some of that
aside for Frodo's headshots.

Huh.

It's not a refund at all.

I'm being audited.

What's so funny?

From where you're
standing, nothing.

I guess you're
probably wondering

why I asked you guys
to come over.

We understand, Alan.

Mental illness is nothing
to be ashamed of.

I'm not mentally ill.

It was a stress clinic.

Did the door lock from the
inside or the outside?

Uh, uh, well, the... the...

Nevertheless, the reason
I called a family meeting

is because, uh, Jake

and Megan
have some news.

Oh, my God.
She's pregnant.

Well, that was easy.

Who wants cake?

How could you do this?

She made me.

What?

Oh, come on.

Between the two of us,
who was a virgin?

Okay, okay.

What's done is done,

but if we can come
together as a family,

we can deal with this
without finger-pointing.

Your father's right.

Let's just calm down
and talk it through.

Is it just me,
or does Herb and Judith's kid

look a lot like Alan?

Well, you know,
there is a slight resemblance.

- Damn it, Jake!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

How could you be
so irresponsible?

I mean, what were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

Did we raise you not to know
any better than this?

What do you have
to say for yourself?

When are you going
to tell him your news?

Ah, I don't want to
make things worse.

See, that's the big difference
between you and me.

And you're a
grandpa now.

Grandpa. Grandpa.

A grandpa and grandma...

Hey.

Hey. How'd
your audit go?

It wasn't so much an audit

as a brutal prison rape
with a number two pencil.

I'm confused.

Did you like it or not?

They say I owe them $80,000.

So not.

But the good news is,
if they take

everything I own,
they'll only get four.

$4,000?

Four dollars.

But I'm not worried.

Because I have the tools to cope
with whatever life throws at me.

No, you don't.

Alan?

Oh, Lyndsey.

Sweetheart,
are you a sight for sore eyes.

Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

Oh.

Alan, you're home.

Hey, Walden, I think now's
the time to tell him.

Tell me what?

Aw.

What's so funny?

From where I'm standing,
everything.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

Oh. Really? Really?

How would you have liked me
to hear about it?

Twitter? Facebook?
A singing telegram?

âª Ta-ra-ra boom-dee-ay,
I banged your girl today âª

âª 'Cause I'm a billionaire,
I still have all my hair. âª

I-I understand
that you're upset,

but you have to see this
from our viewpoint.

What's your viewpoint?

The sex is awesome.

It really is.

He's the best
I've ever had.

No, you're the best
I've ever had.

You're
the best I've had.

- No, you.
- No, you.

Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

How did this happen?

It was actually
kind of a meet cute.

Uh, Lyndsey came here
to see where you were,

and I told her
where you were,

and then she started
to cry, and...

bippity-boppity-boo,
we're having sex.

Bippity-boppity-boo?

How do you go
from crying to sex?

With him, it was always
the other way around.

Okay, okay, and-and-and what
was the cute part?

Look at him.

No, look at you.

- No, you.
- No, you.

Hey! Hey! I'm still here!

I mean, how-how
could you do this?

How-how could you have an affair

while I'm locked up
in the booby hatch?

I thought it
was a stress clinic.

Everybody knows what it was!

I lost my freaking mind!

But luckily, now I'm better,
so I have the tools

to cope with whatever life
throws at me!

That's great, Alan,
'cause there's one more thing.

Oh, super. Let me have it.

- You need to move out.
- What?!

Come on, it'd be
creepy if you're

downstairs listening
while we're having sex.

Lyndsey doesn't make any noise.

I do now.

Fine. Fine.
Let me just get my things.

Uh, not necessary.

We packed your stuff.

Oh, yeah. It's all in a storage
bin out by the airport.

But don't worry, I took care
of the first month's rent.

Here's the key.

Why, thank you.

You know, I hope someday,
we can look back

at this as friends
and just laugh.

Someday?

Why wait? Let's laugh now.

Okay, I'll go.

That's it!

I am done being a doormat.

I'll show 'em.

I will show 'em all.

They won't have Alan Harper
to kick around anymore.

And they will be sorry.

Apologies will be made,

tears will be wept,

but it's all gonna be too late

'cause I am out of here!

Sleeping the big sleep,
the ol' dirt nap.

Adios, muchachos,
it's the last roundup.

God, check, please.

Perfect.

âª Men. âª

Hi! Hi, Mom, it's me!

I need a place to stay.

Walden kicked me out
and my car blew up

and I had to hitchhike
over here!

So, solly,

Missy Everyn no home.

Missy Everyn?!

Come on, Mom!

What are you doing?

Let me in!
I'm soaking wet,

and I had to give a truck driver
a happy ending just to get here!

Go away! I call po-rice!

What kind of accent is
that supposed to be?!

Herro? Po-rice?

Clazy man outside.

You come quick!

Fine, fine! I'm leaving!

Thanks a lot!

Rots of ruck!

Unbelievable.

Blindsided by my son...

reamed by the IRS...

rejected by my lover...

betrayed by my friend...

molested by a truck driver...

cast out by my mother...

and rained on by God.

And this isn't even the worst
week of my life.

Oh, come on.

Might as well make myself
comfortable.

Nowhere to go from here.

End of the line.

Rock bottom.

Can a man sink any lower?

Asked and answered.

Pardon me.

Do you happen
to have a flashlight?

Uh, what?

The light in my storage
unit isn't working.

I need a flashlight.

Oh. Uh, yeah, sure. Um...

Yeah, uh... what the hell?

Oh, here you go.

Thank you.

My fur coats all feel alike
in the dark.

Lot of things feel alike
in the dark.

Ooh, you rascal!

Uh, I'm Alan Harper.

Veronica Hastings.

Come here often?

No, but the night is young.

Ooh. Innuendo?

Not usually.

But if you play
your cards right...

Listen, Alan Harper,

I keep some nice wines
in my storage unit.

Can I interest you
in a glass?

I would like that very much.

Don't go away.

There is no chance
of that happening.

You had a plan all along,
didn't you, God?

Alan?

Yes, Lord?

Over here.

Oh! Oh, Herb.

What are you doing here?

I called Walden.

He told me this is where
I might find you.

Oh, well, I, uh, I appreciate
you stopping by,

but I'm not really set up
for entertaining yet.

I didn't just stop by.

I have some news for you.

Really? Good news?

I had a DNA test done on
my daughter Millie.

Oh?

Turns out she's your daughter.

Bad news.

And it's about to get worse.

Oh, come on!

Good-bye, Alan.

Oh, no, Herb, please, please!

I'm about get laid
by Jessica Rabbit!

No, Herb, no!

Oh, thank God
I'm still in the loony bin.

It's a stress clinic.

âª Men. âª

Thanks for picking me up.

No problem.

I'm surprised Walden let
you take his car.

I know, right?

With my driving record?

I'm really glad
you're feeling better.

You had me worried.

I'm sorry. Didn't mean to.

But everything's fine now.

Good.

Hey, is it too soon
to talk to you

about something important?

You can talk to me
about anything.

I have the tools to cope.

Cool. Remember Megan?

Oh, God...

Well, we've been
going out for a while now

and all of a sudden,
she's saying

she wants to see
other people,

but I want to keep it,
you know, monotonous.

That, that's it?
She's not pregnant?

No, of course not.

I've been stuck at third base
for months.

That's a relief.

For you, maybe.

Anyway, I was just
wondering if you had

some advice on how to keep
a woman from leaving you.

So how was
the food in there?

âª Men. âª

It feels strange
to be back here.

Just to warn you,
things are

a little bit different
than you remember them.

What do you mean?

I promised Walden

I wouldn't tell you.

- Bye.
- Where you going?

I'm gonna take Walden's car
over to Megan's,

see if it helps me
slide into home.

Wear protection!

I'm wearing it now!

Whoa.

Hey, buddy.

How ya doing?

I'm okay.

Good, good, I'm glad.

Walden, you don't have

to talk to me
like a crazy person.

Oh, crazy people
don't talk like this.

Regular people talk
like this when

they're talking
to crazy people.

Fine. Whatever.

I see you finished
redecorating.

Yeah.
What do you think?

Ah, it looks fantastic.

Oh, hey, check this out.

Computer, lights off.

Computer, music on.

âª âª

That's awesome.

Yeah, it's the home
of tomorrow.

Except it's today.

Computer, music off.

Okay, let me try.

Uh, computer, lights on.

Oh, no, that won't work.

It's keyed to my voice.

Oh, well, then how do I turn
the lights on and off?

You can't.

Hey, let me show you
the kitchen.

Boy, sure hope I can flush
the toilet.

âª Ta-da! âª

Ta-da, indeed.

Oh, hey, check this out.

I connected the refrigerator
to the Internet.

Ice.

Wait for it.

Is that cool or what?

And if I want ice?

You just call me and then
I'll call the refrigerator.

Oh, oh, check this out.

Computer, television on.

- Wow!
- Yeah.

What is it about
a giant TV?

Right? I mean, just looking
at it gives me a chubby.

Welcome home, buddy.

Oh, thanks, Walden,
but you and I both know

this is not my home.

Oh, sure, it is.

No, let me finish.

I had a lot of time
to think while I was away.

At least after I came off
the thorazine.

And I realized that it's one
thing to live off my brother,

but he's gone and...

now his stuff's gone, too.

I really don't belong
here anymore.

So you're moving out?

Oh, no, no! God, no!

I mean, look at
the size of this thing.

No, I just want
you to know that

I'm aware of the
absurdity of our situation.

Bring it in.
Oh...

Computer, music on.

âª And I will always
love you... âª

And let me know if you need ice.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Can I ask you
a personal question?

No, Jake, I've never
measured my penis.

No, it's not about that.

I heard my dad say you're
worth like a billion dollars.

You know, I'm not
really comfortable

talking about my
financial situation.

Oh, okay.

Let's just say I'd have
more money than God,

if God only had 900 million.

Wow! You don't have any kids,
do you?

- Nope.
- Here, let me push the cart.

Thanks. So if you have
so much money,

why do you do your
own grocery shopping?

I mean, you could
just write a list

and hire someone
to do it for you.

You know, like a
17-year-old go-getter

with a valid driver's license

and no chance at
getting into college?

Well, I could, but you know,
since I've been single

I find I really like
shopping for myself.

You're kidding. Why?

Well, take this, for example.

"Baco-berries." How could
I put this on a list?

I didn't even
know it existed.

I don't even know
what it is.

What is it, anyway?

"Delicious dried cranberries
infused with real bacon flavor""

Ugh, that's disgusting.

So... do you have a bunch of
houses and yachts and stuff?

Two houses, no yachts.

You should totally get a yacht,

and then hire someone
to drive it for you.

You know, like
a 17-year-old go-getter

with a valid yacht
driver's license.

Ah, yachts are pretentious.

I don't believe in ostentatious
displays of wealth.

Besides, if I need
to get anywhere,

I'll just take my private jet.

You have a jet?

Yeah, and I already got
a go-getter pilot.

With a college degree.

Excuse me, do you know
the difference

between "organic beef"
and "grass-fed beef"?

Yeah, "organic" is, uh, no
antibiotics or growth hormones,

but it can still be
force-fed grain, which produces

a less nutritious product
than cows that are allowed

to naturally graze on grass.

Speaking of which,
you're very pretty,

and your accent makes me
feel tingly inside.

Speaking of which...?

Cows, meat, cuts of steak,

London Broil, England,
your accent,

'ello!

- Hello. I'm Zoey.
- Walden.

Nice to meet you, Walden.

Your accent's rather
charming, as well.

Thanks.

Good luck with your meat.

Thanks.

And they call me Forrest Gump.

What?

She was totally hitting on you.

Really?

You should ask her out.

Okay.

Hey, Zoey, you want to
go on a date with me?

Sure!

See, there's something else

I wouldn't know to
put on the list.

âª Men. âª

Okay...

I can pay the Mastercard
with the Visa,

and the Visa
with the Discover card,

and the Discover with
the American Express...

Now what can I use to complete
my little Ponzi scheme?

Chevron? No.

Blockbuster? They're in
worse shape than I am.

Starbucks gift card.

Ooh, hello latte!

- Hey.
- Hey.

Oh, I know that game--

"Seven Card Screwed."

If I could just get
a little ahead, I'd be fine.

And if I could just
lose a little weight,

I'd be a swimsuit model.

Go ahead, say something,
I dare you.

Oh, no, no.
It's an apt comparison.

They both involve
losing your ass.

Well, I hate to do it,

but I-I could ask Walden
for a short-term loan.

For God's sakes, Zippy,
the man is already

letting you and your kid
live here rent-free.

Don't you have
any pride at all?

Let me say that another way.

Why do you think he's
letting you stay here?

Because he likes me.

Because he likes having at
least one person in his life

that doesn't want
anything from him.

Somebody he thinks
cares about him as a person.

That's a good point.

What you don't
want him to find out

is that you're just one of
those nasty little birds

that picks the food
out of a hippo's teeth.

No, we don't want that.

So, listen, uh...

I suppose, over the years,

you've salted away
a pretty good nest egg.

You're not going to
ask me for money.

No, no! Just making
conversation.

Thanks for bringing in
my groceries, man.

I live to serve.

Boy, I gotta
tell you, Alan,

your son made one heck of
a wingman today.

You make it easy, boss.

Baby bird doesn't fly far
from the teeth.

So you, uh, you met somebody?

Indeed I did.

Beautiful woman. British.

Actually drove her shopping cart
on the wrong side of the aisle.

That's a lot of credit cards.

Uh, yeah.

I've only got this
one black one.

I actually bought
my plane with it.

Oh, oh, oh!
Which reminds me.

Hey Jake, you want
a quarter of a million

frequent flyer miles? I can't
use 'em, I got a plane.

I want a quarter of
a million anything.

All yours, my man.

Hmm, where could I go that's a
quarter of a million miles away?

How about the moon?

That's ridiculous, Dad.

I know, I was kidding.

No one's ever been to the moon.

âª Men. âª

Here you go.

State of the art.

And semi-portable.

Gateway computer.

I haven't seen one
of these in a while.

Still works great. And it
is loaded with software.

Quicken 95, Lotus 1-2-3...
um... WordPerfect, Tetris.

I don't know, pal.

I don't think I can move this.

Oh, come on, help me out,
I'm desperate.

As opposed to most of
the people who come in here.

In my storeroom, I've got
a couple of wheelchairs,

a fishbowl full of glass eyes,

and a "boy in the bubble" bag.

To be clear, they took
the boy out of the bubble

and sold me the bag.

Um...

Uh, what would you give me for
a pair of diamond cufflinks?

Oh...

Where'd you get these?

My mother gave them to me
when I graduated college.

- Is she your real mother?
- Yeah. Why?

'Cause these aren't
real diamonds.

What?!

I'm sure she was a good
mother in other ways.

No, this is the nicest thing
she ever did for me.

I'm very sorry.

All right. All right. I didn't
want to have to sell this,

but, uh, I suppose
I'm out of options.

Ooh.

Oh, nice.

Steuben crystal, huh?

It is.

Your mother didn't
give you this.

No. It was a wedding gift
from my wife's parents.

I managed to sneak it out of
the house after the divorce.

Uh-huh. Well, gimme a sec.

I'll give you $1,200.

Yes!

No!

I'll give you $2.00
to clean it up.

Where's your broom?

âª Men. âª

Jake, I'm ready to go!

Coming!

Here you go, sir.
The car is charged, washed,

and I put an air freshener
under your seat

just in case you
let one slip out.

Good job.

Hundred bucks! Thanks, boss.

You gave him $100?

Oh, hey, Alan.
Yeah, he washed my car.

A hundred bucks
to wash a car?

Not enough?

For $100,
I'd lick your car clean.

Maybe next time.

Hey, I'm going on
a date with that girl

I met in at supermarket.
Do I look okay?

No, I look okay.

You look like the guy
women fantasize about

when I'm on top of them.

Listen, I-I know you're still
pretty new to the dating world,

but can I give you
a little advice?

Is this about condoms?

'Cause Jake already
gave me his lucky one.

No. Uh...

If you hope to have any
kind of shot with this woman,

you, uh, might want to
lose the wedding ring.

Really?

Oh yeah.

When it comes to dating,

wedding rings are
like kryptonite.

If, you know,
Superman was a... vagina.

You know, I haven't
taken this off in years.

When Bridget and I first got
together, we were pretty broke,

so we just exchanged
these cheap bands,

but then, after I made my first
million, I got matching ones

made out of rhodium
and platinum.

In retrospect, I should've had
them made out of poop and tears.

Wait, uh... what's rhodium?

It's the most expensive
metal in the world.

To symbolize how precious
our love was.

Well, that's... very romantic.

But again, it's Lex Luthor
for lady parts.

Boy...

This is gonna be tough.

Wearing it makes me feel...

secure.

Be that as it may,
you have a choice to make.

Either the past,
or the future.

The memory of Bridget,
or the promise of...

supermarket strange.

- Here.
- Why are you giving it to me?

Because you're right.

I've got to
move on with my life.

And this ring is just an anchor
chaining me to the past.

Thanks, Al.

Well, you are very welcome.
Enjoy your date!

Will do. See you.

My precious!

âª Men. âª

So the young man you were
with at the supermarket

is no relation to you?

Oh, no, Jake...
Mm.

is Alan's son.

And Alan is...?

Uh, it's complicated.

I'm fairly bright, try me.

Okay.

Um, when I tried to kill
myself in the ocean,

Alan's house was
the closest one with a phone.

I see.

- You don't, do you?
- Not at all.

- Okay, let me back up.
- Please do.

Okay, when I was in high school,
I met this girl named Bridget.

Is it really necessary to
back up quite that far?

You're right, I'll skip ahead.

Let's see... I got married
right after high school,

happy, happy, happy.

Made like a billion dollars,
rich, rich, rich.

She decided she didn't
want to be married anymore,

sad, sad, sad.

In the ocean,
out of the ocean,

bought Alan's house, got rid
of the furniture, kept Alan,

got hungry, went to the
supermarket, met you. The end.

Wow.

Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

No, no, I have a few
follow-up questions.

The furniture?

The suicide.

Oh, it was just a cry
for attention.

I wanted Bridget
to feel sorry for me.

Well, that's rather pathetic.

In hindsight, yeah.

And the billion dollars?

I sold a couple companies
to Microsoft.

Big mistake.

Oh, you regret it?

No, they do.

How long's it been
since your wife left?

Four months, three weeks,
four days, six hours and change.

Let's just call it six hours.

You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

You really are bright.

I thought it was
just your accent.

It kind of raises
the question,

"Why on Earth did
you ask me out""

Jake told me to.

Alan's son.

Yeah, and also wanted to because
I'm moving on with my life.

See? Look, no wedding ring.

Mmm, I noticed the
bright white tan line.

Yeah, it's almost like
I still got it on.

It is.

No worries. I gave it to Alan.

The man you kept
instead of furniture.

Well, it wasn't an either/or.

What about you?
What's your deal?

My deal.

All right, I'm a lawyer.

Ugh! Ech!

What else?

Well, I'm divorced and I have

a five-year-old daughter, Ava.

I always wanted to have kids,

but Bridget insisted
that we already had one.

I don't follow.

Me.

Oh, sure, I can see that.

What do you think?

Are we gonna fall in love
and stuff?

What?

'Cause that would really teach
Bridget a lesson.

Hi, again.

Oy gevalt.

I, uh, brought something
else for you.

My sphincter's tight
with anticipation.

Platinum and rhodium.

Whoa.

Oh...

very valuable.

Did you steal it?

What?

I'm only asking because it
affects my marketing strategy.

No, it was a gift.

A gift.

Mmm-hmm.

Heh. Good enough for me.

What are you
looking to get for it?

Let's not play this game.

Just... just tell me
what it's worth to you.

What is this,
your phone number?

That's my offer.

Hang on a sec.

You know that's helium?

Hmm?

A down-on-his-luck
birthday clown.

Son of a bitch!

âª Men. âª

This was a lovely
evening, Walden.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Hmm. Well, better

get in, let Ava's
babysitter go home.

Oh, is she still up?
Can I meet her?

I'm sure she's still up,
but no.

Oh, I get it.

You want to know make
sure a guy's gonna be

around a while before
you introduce him-- me.

Exactly.

So, maybe after the third
or fourth date?

I don't think so.

Well, the fifth or sixth?

No.

Seventh or eighth?

I'm starting
to get a bad feeling.

Oh, I'm sorry.

You seem
like a really sweet guy,

but I think you're still kind
of married to your Bridget.

No, no, I'm not.

I haven't been wearing
my ring for, like,

like, almost three hours now.

It may be off your finger,
but it's still in your head.

Face it, you're not
ready to be dating yet.

Thanks again for dinner.

Still married.

That is so untrue.

Bridget, you're not gonna
believe what just happened.

âª Men. âª

Walden?

Walden?!

Down here!

Hey.

Hey.

How's your date?

Not so good.

Oh. So much for Jake's
lucky condom, huh?

Yeah, we never got
to condoms.

She thinks I'm still too
hung up on Bridget.

No kidding.

And the worst part is
Bridget agrees with her.

Well, I might as well put
my ring back on.

You, uh, you, uh, want-want
your ring back?

Yeah.

Here.

Thanks.

I had a feeling sooner
or later you'd want it.

No. You know what?
I was right the first time.

I don't need this anymore.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.

I feel better already.

Oh, good.

All right, I'm gonna
go inside.

Okay, I'm just, I'm just
gonna hang here for a while.

Okay. Good night.

Yeah. Night.

My precious! My precious!
My precious!

My precious! My precious!

My precious!

You saw that?

Yeah.

Probably wondering what it was
all about.

Kinda.

Well... I often enjoy

a, uh, brisk moonlight swim.

Fully clothed?

You leave your clothes on
the beach,

a drifter... steals 'em.

Alan...

I was trying to get
your ring back.

But I don't want it back.

No, not-not for you.

Um, for me.

I was gonna pawn it.

Why?

What do you mean, why?
I need money.

I can't possibly produce enough
sperm and blood

to get out of the hole I'm in.

In fact, I went to the pawn shop

while you were on your date.

But you didn't pawn it.

I couldn't.

Wow, you must have been
freaking out

when I threw it
in the ocean, huh?

The truth of that stands
dripping before you.

Listen, if you
needed money,

why didn't you just ask?

You'd lend me money
if I just asked?

No. I don't believe in
lending money.

I just give it away.

Give it away?

Yeah, I think it's a bad idea
to lend people money.

They never pay you back,

and then you just end up
resenting them.

So how much do you need?

Uh...

No, no, I can't, I can't
take your money.

What, you're too proud?

Oh, God, no, I-I-I
haven't had any pride

since the gym showers
in seventh grade.

No, no, if I took your money,

that would change
our relationship,

and I don't want that.

I want you to think of me as
a friend and not a freeloader.

You don't think that ship's
already sailed?

Allow me at least
the illusion of self-respect.

Would it help your self-respect
if I started charging you rent?

Actually, it would.

Consider it done.

Great.

Oh, I'm gonna be late
this month.

No problem.

Probably next month, too.

Thanks for the heads up.

Okay. I guess I better
go dry off.

Hey, Alan.
Yeah?

You're a quality guy.

Really?

I have a lot of people that
say they're my friend,

but you really are one.

Well, thanks.

Just-just out of curiosity,
if I had asked for, say,

a hundred thousand dollars,

would you have given it to me?

Absolutely.

Where you going?

Back in the ocean.

Hello?

Oh, hey, Jake.

No, your dad's kind of busy
right now.

What's up?

Oh, you used the
frequent flier miles?

That's great.
Where are you?

I have no idea.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on

Excuse me, do you know
the difference

between "organic beef"
and "grass-fed beef"?

She was totally hitting on you.

You should ask her out.

Hey, Zoey, you want
to on a date with me?!

Sure!

When I was in high school,
I met this girl named Bridget.

You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

See, look. No wedding ring.

Hmm, I noticed
the bright white tan line.

No worries. I gave it to Alan.

Oh... very valuable.

You seem like
a really sweet guy,

but I think you're still kind
of married to your Bridget.

Face it, you're not ready
to be dating yet.

You want your ring back?

Yeah.

I don't need this anymore.

You sure?

I'm positive.

My precious! My precious!

My precious! My precious!

My precious!

Mind if I take this?

Oh, uh, no--
somebody's sitting there.

Well, where are they?

They're not here yet.

Well, I'm here
and I need a chair.

No, uh...

honestly, I have a girl coming.

Well, when she gets here,
I'll give it back to her.

See, I don't believe that.

You calling me a liar?

No, but I've been burnt before.

I'm taking this chair.

No, you're not.

Yes, I am. Let go!

You let go
of the chair.

I had the chair before
you even came into the place.

- It's mine now!
- It's my chair now!

Walden, is everything all right?

Ha! She's here.
Now back off!

What was that all about?

It was an attempt
at a chairjacking.

Here, I get you a tea.

Thank you.
I'm sorry I'm late.

I'm trying to get my daughter
into Bellwood Academy.

It's a nightmare.

She tests well, but she did
not give a good interview.

How old is
your daughter again?

Five.

And Bellwood Academy is a...?
Kindergarten.

Wow, when I was five,
I got kicked out of preschool

for biting my teacher.

Why did you bite her?

She tried to steal my chair.

Yeah, you heard me! I bit her!

She had to get a shot!

Take it easy, okay?

So I was rather surprised

to hear from you.
What's up?

I was thinking a lot about what
you said about not wanting

to date me while I was
still, you know,

emotionally attached
to my ex-wife.

I said you were still
hopelessly in love with her.

Potato, Po-tah-to.

The point is you were right.

I wasn't ready to start
dating, but I am now.

A whole week later.

I understand your skepticism.

Which is why I want you to
witness what I'm about to do.

These...

are my final divorce papers.

And once I sign them, my
marriage will be over forever.

I was hoping that you
and I could start fresh.

Nothing like starting off
a new relationship

on the ashes of the old one.

That's what I was thinking.

Oh, uh, you got a pen?

Uh, I don't think I do.

Okay.

Uh, does anybody got a pen
I can borrow?

Anyone? Nobody?

Excuse me.

Do you got a pen?

Sorry.

It's unbelievable.

Oh, man.

Can I please borrow your pen?

I'm sorry, someone's using it.

Who?

They're not here yet.

I will give you a hundred
dollars to borrow that pen.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh âª
âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

Jolly good sunset, eh, what?

Excuse me?

I like the way you talk,

so I thought
I'd give it a go.

Well, no one says "jolly good"
unless they're appearing in

a revival of Oliver.

Right, right, right, right,
right, right.

Please, sir,
may I have a kiss?

Stop it!

No, seriously, I want a kiss.

All right.

- Mm. So...
- Hmm?

would you like to stay
for dinner tonight?

Oh, I'd love to, but I have
to pick up my daughter.

- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

- How about dinner this weekend?
- Sure.

Great.
You like Mexican food?

I do.

Ooh, terrific.

So we'll go to Guadalajara.

Oh, that a new
restaurant?

No, it's an old city in Mexico.

You want to go to
Mexico for dinner?

Yep. We'll take my plane.

I'll have you back
by midnight.

So, hang on--
you-you don't own a pen,

but you own a plane?

Yeah, you can
always borrow a pen.

Try to borrow a plane.

- So...
- Mm?

what do you say?

Hmm... Let me see if
I can get a sitter.

Oh!

Yay!

- Mm-hmm.
- You know, I think we should

start making plans
for Christmas.

We can go surfing in Fiji,
skiing in the Alps,

making out in Malibu.

Yes, now, Walden,
let's be very clear:

You are a sweet and
wonderful guy,

but you've just come out

of a very long-term relationship,
- Sweet and wonderful.

so you're clearly on
the rebound.

Uh-huh. So?

Yes. So I don't know

if we should be making
Christmas plans just yet.

- Okay.
- Hmm?

Fine.
We'll slow things down.

Good.

Forget Christmas.

Thank you.

You'll be my Valentine,
though, right?

Oh, my God.

You're like no man
I've ever met.

Mmm! A bit of an
odd bloke, eh, what?

Oh, God, stop it.

Nudge, nudge, wink, wink,
say no more.

This is nice.
Like old times.

How so?

You and me, sitting
here, watching TV

while the good-looking
owner of the house is

out on the deck swapping
spit with a hot chick.

Yeah, there is
a bit of deja vu.

Not only that.

It feels like it's
happened before.

Yes, it does.

Man, I've seen so much
crazy stuff in this house,

I could write a book.

That's a good idea.
Got a title?

Hmm...

Maybe I can't
write a book.

All right then, cheerio!

Cheerio?

Means "good-bye"
in England.

Oh.

What do they have for
breakfast over there,

a bowl of good-byes?

- 'Ello, lads.
- Well, hey.

So, Zoey seems very nice.

Yeah, the bird really tickles
my fancy.

Help me out here.

Is "fancy" the English
word for "nutsack"?

No, it means that I like her.

I think this could get serious.

Wow, you're moving pretty quick,
aren't you?

That's what she said.

What are you laughing at?

He did a "That's what
she said" joke.

Because that's what she said.

Oh. That's not funny.

She thinks I'm on the rebound.

Well, aren't you?

You were with Bridget
for 15 years.

That's over.
I signed the divorce papers.

I'm ready to fall in love again.

Please tell me you didn't
actually say that to her.

Why?

Dude, even I know that's wrong.

Walden, you're young,
you're rich, you're handsome.

If I was even one
of those things

I would have screwed myself
to death years ago.

Well, I want to be in
a relationship...

with romance and intimacy
and commitment.

Oh, I get it. You're a chick.

Jake, we're living in
his house.

A very nice chick.

This is absolutely
ridiculous.

You don't have to wear the hat
if you don't want to.

It's not the hat.
Well, it's not totally the hat.

It's the incredible
extravagance.

You do realize I'm still not
ready to sleep with you, yes?

Oh, I'm not trying
to have sex with you.

Why not?
What's wrong with me?

Nothing. Why? Do you want
to have sex with me?

Yeah! No! No, it's too soon.
It's too soon.

Well, is it too soon...

for this?

Oh, God, Walden,
what have you done?

What do you think?

I think you're out
of your bloody mind.

I can't accept this.

Why not?

Because it's too much.

It's crazy!

What about getting a diamond
necklace for a girl

you've haven't slept with yet

while flying to Mexico
for dinner

on your private jet is crazy?

Okay, when I say it out loud

it does sound a little crazy.

Good thing I didn't get you
the matching tiara.

Okay, uh, there might be
one other thing.

Oh, God, you didn't buy me
a pony, did you?

No. Why, do you want one?

No, I don't.

The thing is, I know some people

on the board
of the private school

you're trying to get
your daughter in,

so I pulled some strings
and got her enrolled.

Wait-- you got Ava
into Bellwood?

But don't worry, one phone call
and she's out on her ass.

No, don't do that!

Walden, this is wonderful!

You're not upset?

No! No, no, no.

What you did is brilliant.

Mm!
Utterly brilliant.

Mr. Schmidt, we'll be descending

into Guadalajara in
a few minutes.

Circle, circle!

Excuse me?

He's about to descend
into London.

Hello, Heathrow!

Oh, God, that is
not funny.

What a lovely
landing strip.

âª Men. âª

- Morning.
- Morning.

Want to explain
the hat?

It's not a hat, it's a sombrero.

"Sombrero" is Spanish for "hat""

Really?
Seems awfully complicated.

Why don't they
just call it a hat?

No, not worth it.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Cameron Diaz, seÃ±or.

- Cameron Diaz?
- Choose your battles.

Right.

So, how'd it go last night?

It was great.

I think I'm falling in love.

Oh, Walden, that's
muy grande chiquita.

Hey, man...

I really don't appreciate
you making fun of me.

Sorry.

I'll get it.

Who knew he spoke Spanish?

âª Zoey, Zoey,
Zoey, Zoe, Zoey... âª

Bridget.

I can't sign the divorce papers.

I love you and I want you back.

Oh, bollocks.

âª Men. âª

Wait... whoa, whoa,
wait, I...

I don't understand.

You're the one who
wanted the divorce.

I know-- I thought
it's what I wanted,

but when I saw your name
on the papers,

I just, I couldn't sign.

Ay, Chihuahua.

Stop it.

Sorry, it's the hat.

Is everything okay?
You don't look happy.

Yeah, no, yeah,
it's great.

I just...

What about that doctor
you were dating?

Alex?

I saw him.
He's a dreamboat.

The truth is, he was
just a rebound thing.

Yeah, but rebounds
work out sometimes.

I mean, take Abe Lincoln.

He met his wife on a rebound,

and, and they had a
long-term relationship.

Until, you know...

Hm... I didn't know
Abe Lincoln killed himself.

How many rebounds have you
had since we broke up?

Well...

It's a trap, don't answer.

None that meant anything.

Yes!

I mean, I haven't
exactly been celibate.

- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
- But I haven't been a slut, either.

Attaboy.

Come on, let's go upstairs.

- Really?
- Don't you want to?

Well, yeah, I want to.

I just, I-I...shouldn't
we be taking it slow?

We've been married
for 15 years, Walden.

Come on.

Okay.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Hi.

It's very weird that you
live with these people.

So what's he gonna
do about Zoey?

Well, unless I miss my guess,

he's gonna lie to both of them
until it blows up in his face,

and everyone gets
their feelings hurt,

and he's left alone
and miserable.

Wow. That sucks.
Isn't there a better way to

date two women
at the same time?

Aw, Jake...

No.

I want you so badly.

Yeah, yep, I, uh...

...want you too.
I was such a fool.

I can't believe I let someone
as great as you get away.

Wait, you said I was immature.

You are, but that's
part of your charm.

I love you, Walden.

I love you, I love you,
I love you.

That is awesome.

Uh...

Just... okay,
okay, well...

Can we just hold on
for one second?

- Where are you going?
- Uh, the bathroom.

Why don't you just use that one?

I'm a little pee shy.

I don't want you to hear me.

Since when?

It's a new thing.

People change, Bridget,
people grow.

Do you think you and Mom
would ever get back together?

Well, you know I will always
care for your mother.

She's a terrific lady,
and a great mom,

and no one can predict
the future...

but no freakin' way.

She said the same thing.

But used a different word
than "freakin'."

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hey.

Everything all right?

Uh, no. As Zoey would say,

I'm in a bit of a sticky wicket.

You mean you were
in a sticky wicket,

then you finished up and
came down here for a snack.

No, no, I-I have a conundrum.

Then you should've worn it.

Might've avoided the stickiness,
you know, wicket-wise.

Okay, I'm just going
to talk to you.

Please.

I've been dreaming about getting
back together with Bridget

for months now, but since
I met Zoey, I'm not so sure.

- It is a pickle.
- What's a pickle?

Shh.

What does your heart tell you?

My heart tells me that

Bridget is the past,
and Zoey is the future.

Oh, I get it.
You're trying to figure out

which one gets your pickle.

Essentially, yes.

Well, then, I say
follow your heart.

I say follow your pickle.

Try to ignore him.

I've been with Bridget
for 15 years.

That's tough to
just walk away from.

But as you said yourself,
Bridget's the past.

Yeah, but if I get
back together with her,

I don't have to
give up $600 million

in a divorce settlement.

The future's overrated.
Go with Bridget.

I mean, it does make sense,
right? All I'd have to do

is sell this place
and move back in with her.

You can't live your
life in the past.

- Go with Zoey.
- You think?

I do. And I don't have
a horse in this race.

No, you're right.

Zoey it is.

Thank you, Alan.

Cheerios!

You have no shame, do you?

Shame, no.

Malibu beach house, yes.

Welcome back.

Oh, boy.

Bridget, I can't remember--

do you like your Band-Aids
taken off quick or slow?

I don't understand.

Let's just go with quick.

I don't think it's a good
idea to sleep with you,

since I started
seeing someone new

and I think she might
be the real deal.

Not that you weren't
the real deal,

you're just the ex-real deal,

and she's the next real deal.

Anyway, I'd like for you you to
sign the divorce papers,

so we can both go meet
people we like better.

- What?
- Friends?

- I am so humiliated!
- I'm sorry!

I can't believe you waited till
I was half naked in your bed

to tell me you were
seeing someone else!

Kind of hard to bring up while
you're taking off my pants.

And by the way,
you look sensational.

The Pilates is
really paying off.

Go to hell,
you son of a bitch!

How about an "attaboy" for not

having sex with you out of
respect for the other woman

I'm falling in love with?

Drop dead!

How many times have
we seen this movie?

Too many to count.

Maybe it's the house.

- What do you mean?
- I think it's haunted.

Like, built on an angry
woman burial ground.

Certainly can't be the fault
of the men who live in it.

Sometimes at night,
if I'm really quiet,

I think I can hear
them bitching.

That didn't go as well
as I'd hoped.

I wouldn't worry about it.

She doesn't look like
the type to carry a grudge.

But I don't know her
like you do.

Haunted...

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

So the madam
of the brothel opens the door

and there's a man on the stoop
with no arms and no legs.

And she says, "What do you think
you're going to do here?"

And he says,
"I rang the bell, didn't I?"

You're terrible.

Did he break your heart?

Who are you?

That doesn't matter.

Do you want him back, or
do you want him to suffer?

I don't know.

That's all right.

Oftentimes,
they're the same thing.

Come with me,
and I'll teach you.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Oh, dear!

I'm sorry, did
I wake you up?

What are you doing?

I was trying to find
a nice way to wake you up.

Well, kudos, you found one.

Here. Merry day
before Christmas.

I thought we agreed not
to exchange presents.

Well, you gave me a pretty
nice present last night.

Actually two.

You're terrible.

Open it.

Dare I say it?
Key to your heart?

Better. It's a key
to my house.

Walden, I can't accept
a key to your house.

It's a bit premature.

Well, if anything in our
relationship's going to be premature,

I prefer it to be
the house key.

It's a very sweet gesture.

Mistletoe.

Oh, my!

I've got to pick up my daughter
from her father's

and I've got to get to the
airport to pick up my parents.

Are you sure I can't
come with you?

Positive.

Why not?
We get along great.

Your parents are in town,
my mom's coming to visit.

It's Christmas.

What better time for everybody
to get to know each other?

Walden, we're still
getting to know each other.

- I know you.
- Really?

What color
are my eyes then?

Brown. the left one's got a
little fleck of green in it.

Damn.

You say you're a size two,
but you're actually a size four.

You run the water
in the bathroom

to cover the sound
of you peeing.

All right fine. Let me put it
another way.

No families this year.

And I am a size two.

Merry Christmas.

She took the key.

Aw!

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

When's your mom
getting in?

Any time now.

She's on her way
up from San Diego.

Oh, hey, is Jake's room ready?

I did what I could.

It still has kind of
a teenage stink to it.

Maybe I should put her
in Alan's room.

Oh, no, that smells
like failure and foot powder.

Is that mistletoe?

Yes.

Well, bring it, Santa.

Oh, merry Christmas to me.

You know they make belt
buckles with mistletoe on 'em?

You're kidding.

Check your stocking.

So, listen, uh, I want to give
you a nice Christmas bonus.

What do you think
would make you happy?

Check your damn stocking
and put on the buckle.

How about three weeks pay and
another kiss on the cheek?

Do I get to pick
the cheek?

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Hey, Mom, where are you?

Oh, okay,
that's about ten miles away...

and it's rush hour,
so figure... three hours.

Yeah, I can't wait
to see you, too.

So I'm thinking that since

this is our first Christmas
without Charlie,

we should spend it together.

Yes, Mom,
I'd rather get laid, too...

but I think
family is more important.

Hey, Mom.

Yeah, I'm just driving
to Dad's.

In 500 feet,
turn left.

Yes, I'm seeing someone.

No, you can't meet her.

Because it's too soon.

I don't know what it means.

It's just
what she keeps telling me.

Uh, Mom, y-you're breaking up.

I-I'm sorry, what did you say?

Y-Y-You want a tuna sandwich?

Oh, oh, you're
in a two-man sandwich.

Uh, well, I, I hope
they're using condiments.

Uh, well, listen, I-I-I got
to go, I got another call.

Dear Lord.

Hello.

Oh, Jake, merry Christmas.

Hey, Dad,
I just wanted to call

and tell you merry Christmas
and wish you happy holidays.

No, no, Mom and Herb
are out to dinner.

I'm just chilling
at the ski lodge.

Room service.

Oh, hang on.

I ordered
a cheeseburger.

Got to go, Dad.

Yeah, I know
the tip's included.

All right, bye.

All right, now you call your mom

and tell her
you're with your dad.

Hey, Mom, I'm with your dad.

No, no.

âª Men. âª

This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

Yeah, swell.

I got a great
new girlfriend.

My girlfriend's got a
great new boyfriend.

My mom is coming.

So is mine.

Wherever she is.

Went to the Apple Store

and bought myself
a bunch of cool presents.

I went to the grocery store
and got myself an apple.

Sounds like somebody's got
the holiday blues.

Oh, little bit.

My son's with his
mother and her husband,

and this is my first Christmas
without Charlie.

What would you two
normally do?

Oh, we had kind of
a holiday tradition.

Um, he would drink
a gallon of eggnog

and then try to throw me
out of the house at gunpoint.

Good times.

Well, you're not going
to spend this year alone.

You're going to have Christmas
with me and my mom.

Well, thank you,
that's very nice of you.

You want to hear a funny idea?

You and my mom
are about the same age.

If you guys started dating
and got married,

you'd be my new daddy.

Wait, h-hold on,
I-I'm your mom's age?

How old do you think I am?

I don't know, what, like 60?

I'm 44.

Oh, well, you look older.

Oh, there she is.

That's it.

Tomorrow I start moisturizing.

- Mom.
- Baby.

Eyeball, eyeball.

Nose and mouth.

I love you north.

I love you south.

Hey, Alan, meet
my mother Robin.

Nice to meet you, Alan.

Likewise.

Mom, let me show
you my place.

Check it out, I
got my own ocean.

Well, it's not
completely mine.

I have to share the
other side with Japan.

It's very nice, dear.

Yeah, I'm rich.

Well... I know
what I want for Christmas.

âª Men. âª

So how long have you two
been living together?

A couple
of months.

I see.

I'm sorry, I-I have to ask.

Is this the woman
you don't want me to meet?

What?

No.

No, Alan is just a friend.

Tell her.

Butch and Sundance,
not Brokeback Mountain.

Okay, sorry.

I-I mean, you have to admit,
it's a rather strange set-up--

a 33-year-old man living
with a 60-year-old.

I'm 44.

Right, me, too.

Alan helped me through
my break-up with Bridget,

and then he needed
a place to stay,

so I asked him
to stick around.

Oh, that is so like you.

When Walden was
a little boy,

he used to bring home sick,
helpless animals all the time.

God help me,
I can't take that as an insult.

So, uh, what do you do, Robin?

I'm a primatologist.

I, I work mainly
with gorillas.

Oh, oh, so I guess that makes
you the gorilla my dreams.

It was hysterical
when Bugs Bunny did it.

And thanks
to the financial support

of my brilliant son,
I have a private

gorilla sanctuary in Temecula.

Oh, no kidding?

Yeah, we take
gorillas

who were born
in captivity

and those who have lost
their wild habitats

and provide them
with a safe, stable,

loving family
environment.

Oh, that sounds wonderful.

Does one have to be a gorilla
to apply for admittance?

I'm afraid so.

Story of my life.

When I was little,
I always wanted

to play with the gorillas.

I even made up my own
imaginary gorilla friend.

Remember Magilla, Mom?

Hmm, yeah,
but he wasn't imaginary.

What?

Walden, Magilla lived
with us

for the first four years
of your life.

He was real?

Yeah.

Do you want
to see some pictures?

Wait, w-w-wait,
Magilla was real?

Very much so.

Wait, you actually had
a gorilla living with you?

Yep, I was doing experiments
to see if gorillas could learn

as fast as human children, so

I raised Magilla and Walden
together from birth.

Wow.

All we had was a schnauzer
and an Argentinean tennis pro.

Uncle Javier.

The tennis pro,
not the schnauzer.

Hold on a second,
I was raised with a gorilla?

Oh, well, just until
you started preschool.

Now, look, here's you and
Magilla together in your crib.

And here's

the two of you
at your first birthday.

Wait a minute,

is that how I learned
sign language?

I'm sorry, I don't have
any bananas.

Look, there's
the two of you

on the playground.

Oh, your first
Halloween.

You went as a gorilla,

and Magilla went as a ghost.

Whoa, whoa.

Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's
starting to come back to me.

Like, riding
tricycles together,

and running...
running around the house.

Or playing hide in the closet.

Wait. Why were we always
hiding in the closet?

Well, the Homeowners Association
didn't allow cats or dogs.

What would they have said
about a gorilla?

Yeah. I remember.

You told me he was my brother.

Well, in a sense, he was.

And then one day, he was gone.

Yeah.

You said
he got sent back to the jungle.

Well, sweetheart,
we didn't have any choice.

He was getting too big.
He, uh...

He tried
to kill a Jehovah's Witness.

Now, Now, to be fair,
who among us hasn't...

Not now, Alan.

This is really starting
to freak me out.

Well, sweetie,
I-I don't understand

why you're making such
a big deal out of this.

You're kidding, right?

I-I just discovered
that my brother is a gorilla!

That's-That's
kind of a big deal!

Hey, my brother was a pig,
so, I mean...

I said, not now, Alan!

Walden, calm down.

You do realize
that I spent my entire childhood

worrying that if I misbehaved,

I would get sent away
to the jungle like Magilla!

One false move, Zimbabwe!

Well, sweetheart, I...

I never knew
that you felt like that.

Of course you didn't.

You were so busy
doing your experiment!

Walden!

Kids, huh?

So, you seeing anybody?

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Walden, it's Mom.
Where are you?

Please call me back
so we can talk about this.

I had no idea he'd repressed
all those childhood memories.

Well, apparently,

losing what he thought was
his sibling was very traumatic.

I'm wondering if maybe I have
to rethink his Christmas gift.

Why? What did you get him?

A bathrobe.

Yeah, not a good idea.

And I can't even return it.

It's slightly irregular.

You must think
I'm a terrible mother.

Well, let's compare
mothering techniques.

Um, did you tell him
that Disneyland burned down

to avoid having
to take him there

for his sixth, seventh
and eighth birthdays?

No.

Did you tell him
to walk it off

after his appendix burst?

No.

Did you tell me
the only reason you got pregnant

was because you didn't want
to smear your lipstick?

Of course not!

Then, far as I'm concerned,

you're Mother
of the Freakin' Year. Hmm.

Mm. Although I did store
Walden's embryo

in a cryogenic chamber until
Magilla's mother got pregnant

so they could be born
at the same time.

Okay, flag on the play.

You did what?

I needed my child
and the gorilla

to be born at the same time
for the experiment to be valid.

And your husband
was okay with this?

It was for science.

And I may not have told him.

Okay, well, well, after all
that time and energy,

what did you learn?

My son is smarter
than a gorilla.

Mine's not.

âª Men. âª

Oh, Walden,
what are you doing here?

My brother is a gorilla,
and she sent him away.

I'm sorry. Is that some sort
of American Christmas Carol?

No. It's a succinct summation

of my seminal years
with a simian sibling.

Are you drunk?

I ought to be.
I've taken the necessary steps.

Sweetie, this isn't
a very good time.

You're telling me.

My mother is a mad scientist,

and I spent the first four years
of my life

flinging poop with my brother...
the gorilla.

Hello!

Mummy and Daddy,

this is the fellow
I was telling you about.

How do you do?

Wing Commander Edward
Hyde-Tottingham, R.A.F. retired.

This is my wife Sharon.

Hello.

Nice to meet you.

Let me ask you something, Shary.

Would you have raised
your daughter

with a jungle beast
in an effort

to satisfy
your scientific curiosity?

Well... I really couldn't say.

I have cross-bred orchids.

Yes. They're lovely.

As are you, my darling.

Walden, I don't understand.

Did something happen
with your mother?

Oh, yeah, something happened.

My entire life is a lie.

You know why I try so hard
to please you sexually?

Because

I'm afraid if I don't
give you multiple orgasms,

that you'll banish
me to Central Africa.

What?!

The Commander and I have often
traveled to Africa on safari.

Is that so?

Oh, yes.

Though I can't say
I've ever had multiple orgasms.

Lucky if I get the one.

âª Men. âª

Come on, Walden,
call me back.

I'm worried sick.

He always disappears
like this when he's upset.

As a child, he'd climb
into a tree to sulk,

and when I'd try
to get him down,

he'd beat his chest
and bellow at me.

Remind you of anybody?

Yeah. His father.

Hello?

Oh, uh, hi, Zoey.

Walden's not here.

Really?

Okay, well, well, thanks
for letting me know.

What's going on?

Apparently, your son got drunk

and climbed up
onto his girlfriend's roof.

He, what?

Still early. We could
catch a movie.

Are you out of your mind?
We have to go get him.

Oh, oh, absolutely, sure. I was
just about to suggest that.

Are you on Facebook?

Maybe I could give
you a poke sometime.

âª Men. âª

Uh... Walden?

What are you doing here?

Well... to be perfectly honest,

I'm trying
to impress your mother.

Why? She used me
as a guinea pig.

Yeah, well,
my mother once left me

at summer camp
till Thanksgiving.

So?

So, we can't keep
blaming our parents

for how our lives turned out.

Oh! Oh!

Be careful.
If you fall, you'll die.

Thank you.

Did you forgive your mother?

No, never,

but I'm a small, petty man.

You, however,
have accomplished great things

and have the capacity
to accomplish even more.

What about Magilla?

I loved him,
and she just sent him away.

Yeah. That's rough.

But I know what it's like
to lose a brother.

Who, by the way, also tried
to kill a Jehovah's Witness.

He was hung over,

and they just kept ringing
that damn doorbell.

This is the LAPD.

Please get off of the roof!

Go away! Leave me alone!

Don't wave your arms
at the aircraft.

That never ends well.

Get out of here!

It's all right!

It's just a mother issue!

Walden, you come down
from there right now!

Oh, excuse me?

Are you Walden's mum?

Yes. Are-Are you Zoey?

- I am.
- It's so nice to meet you.

Likewise. These
are my parents.

Wing Commander
Edward Hyde-Tottingham.

This is my
wife Sharon.

Lovely to meet you.

Your son's a charming
young man.

Yes, charming.

Thank you.

Thinks he's the brother
of a monkey.

What's all that about?

I think
that's my dad up there.

I think you're right.

Want to get some
frozen yogurt?

Totally.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Walden, I hope
you understand, honey,

I never meant to hurt you.

I know.

This is the best
Christmas gift ever.

Oh, I'm so glad.

See you in a few.

You really are
a terrific mom.

Oh, thanks.

And woman.

Give it a rest, Alan.

Magilla?

That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

Yeah.

What's the Taser for?

That's a 400-pound gorilla.

This really could have
gone either way.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two And A Half Men...

Hey, Alan,
meet my mother, Robin.

- Nice to meet you, Alan.
- Likewise.

I know what I want for
Christmas.

- Bridget?
- I can't sign the divorce papers.

I love you, and
I want you back.

I want you so badly.

I... want you, too.

I don't think it's a good
idea to sleep with you,

since I started seeing
someone new,

and I think she might
be the real deal.

Not that you weren't the
real deal; you're just

the ex-real deal, and
she's the next real deal.

I can't believe you waited till
I was half-naked in your bed

to tell me you were seeing
someone else.

Kinda hard to bring up while
you're taking off my pants.

Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

That didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.

I wouldn't worry about it.

She doesn't look like the
type to carry a grudge.

âª Men... âª

Oops.

What?

Nothing.

A social media company I
invested in just went belly-up.

Oh, no. How much
did you invest?

I don't know.
About $80 million.

$80 million...?!

Eh, give or take.
Mostly took.

And-And you consider losing that
kind of money an "oops"?

Yeah.

No, no, no. "Oops" is when you
clip your toenails

too close and they bleed.

"Oops" is when you mistake

toothpaste for lubricant.

"Oops" is when you thought a
fart in the elevator

was going to be silent.

You've mistaken toothpaste for
lubricant?

Just once.

Stung like hell, but my penis
was minty fresh.

Wait, how do you know
it was minty fresh?

Years of yoga and loneliness.

- Uh-oh.
- What?

Ex-wife.

Uh, see that's
the correct use of the "uh-oh."

Hello, Bridget.

Yeah, I just saw.

Yes, I know
half the money is yours.

Was yours.

Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

but I'm still the president of
the company

and I can invest the money any
way I want.

What do you mean,
"We'll see about that"?

Well, I can't do that, Bridget.

But apparently, Alan can.

H-Hello? Bridget...

"Uh-oh"?

"Oh, crap."

Oh... crap.

Yeah, that's better.

âª Men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh âª

âªMen, men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh âª
âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª
Okay, Bridget...

you've got your board meeting,
but I don't see the point.

The stock of the company is
divided between the three of us,

and obviously my mother is going
to vote with me.

Are you sure about that?

Of course I am. Right, Mom?

Well darling,
you know I love you.

Oh, crap.

The fact is, you have been

burning through a lot
of money recently.

It's my money to burn through!

I can't believe you turned my
own mother against me.

We're just looking out for
everyone's best interest.

Sweetie, no one is against you.

With all due respect, Robin,
I'm against him.

Now, I'd like to propose that
Walden Schmidt be removed

as president of Walden
Loves Bridget Enterprises,

and going forward all
financial decisions

will be made by a
majority vote of the board.

You're kicking me
out of my own company?!

You'll still have
a vote on the board.

- All in favor.
- Aye.

- Aye.
- Naaaay!

Motion is passed.
Aye.

Come on, Mom!

I'm sorry, sweetie,
it's for your own good.

Next, I'd like to propose
doubling the budget

of the Robin Schmidt Primate
Research Center.

- Why would we double the bud...?
- Aye.

- Aye.
- Motion carried.

I move that the
meeting be adjourned.

Second it.

- All in favor. Aye.
- Aye.

Meeting adjourned.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

This is... this is not over!

I'm gonna get an attorney,
and I'm going to fight this!

I thought I was your attorney.

I'm sorry, Uncle Martin,
you're out.

âª Men... âª

What do you think, Counselor?
Can I fight 'em?

- I have a few questions first.
- Shoot.

Walden Loves Bridget
Enterprises?

What do you want from me?

I had a billion dollars
and a constant erection.

Fortunately, all you
lost in the divorce is

the half a billion dollars.

Okay, the first thing I
do when I get the company

back is change the name.

Yeah, well, be that as it may,
the fact remains that as long

as it's just the three of you on
the board, they can outvote you.

- Aw...
- But the good news is...

- Yay.
- Let me finish.

According to these bylaws,

you as founder have
the unilateral right

to name a fourth
person to the board.

And in the case of a tie
vote, you also have the

right to break that tie.

So, if I put someone
on the board and the

vote's two-two, I win.

Right.

You are very smart.

It's not
just a hat rack.

Great. Hey, do you want to be on
the board of my company?

I'll change the name
to Walden Loves Zoey, Inc.

Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea

to mix business and,
you know, genitalia.

Okay. Well, will you at
least be my lawyer?

Of course.

I'm already screwing you.

âª Men. âª

So basically you have to
find a fourth board member

who you can totally control.

- Like a puppet.
- A patsy.

A tool.
And would help

if they're not terribly bright
when it comes to finance.

Where am I going to find
somebody like that?

âª You're the one that I want,
you're the one that I want âª

âª Ooh, ooh, ooh âª

âª The one that I want,
you're the one that want âª

âª Ooh, ooh, ooh... âª

So, I've narrowed my
choices down to two.

- âª You better shape up âª
- Alan?

âª 'Cause need a man âª

âª And my heart is set on you âª

âª Better shape up âª

âª You better understand that my heart...âª
Al?

- Alan?
- Oh, golly.

Whatcha doing?

Uh, well, there is a theory that
uh... wind resistance

can be reduced by the removal
of body hair.

What, are you running a
marathon?

Yeah, why else would I be
shaving my legs?

Because I like the way it feels?
What's up?

How would you like to be on
the board of my company?

Oh... Are you kidding?
I would like nothing more

than to be on the board
of your company.

Good.

- Just one question.
- Yeah?

What exactly does it mean to be?

Basically, all you got to do is
vote with me

so I can take back control from
ex-wife and my mother.

Oh, hey, anything I can do

to stick it to ex-wives and
mothers, I'm there.

- Thanks.
- Uh, uh...Just out of curiosity,

um, is there an honorarium
or a stipend

for members of the board?

Nothing to speak of.
Oh.

$50,000 a year.

Sorry.

I'm celebrating out of both ends
of my body.

I shudder to think what would
have happened

if I'd have said
a hundred thousand.

We would've had
to drain the tub.

Well, anyway, it's great to know
you're on my team.

Oh, absolutely.
You can count on me.

Got a lot of wind
resistance down there?

Not anymore.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

What's the
point of this, Walden?

You know we're just gonna
outvote you again.

For your own good, sweetie.

Thanks, Mom.
But before we get to voting,

I'd like to introduce you to
Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce,

my new attorney
and sex partner.

My card just says "attorney."

What's he doing here?

Wanna tell 'em, Alan?

Mmm. Hold on.

Lox.

Walden put me on the board.

You can't do that!

Oh, but I can.

Sock it to 'em, babe.

These are the corporate bylaws

of... Walden Loves Bridget
Enterprises.

I told you I'm
gonna change the name.

I call your attention
to page five,

paragraph four, subparagraph B.

It states that Walden,
as founder,

has the unrestricted right

to name one additional
board member.

Really looking forward
to working with you.

Aye.

Alan, wait till there's a vote.

Oh, okay.
Um, you know, there's no way

we're gonna finish
all this food.

We should really get some Ziploc
baggies and take it home.

Not now, Alan.

Oh, let me just get it out of
the sun.

Okay, I would like to move that
I be reinstated as president.

All in favor? Aye.

Alan?

- Now?
- Now.

Walden, why are
you doing this?

Bridget and I are just
going to vote no and then

you're going to have a tie.

Au contraire, mon frÃ¨re.

Counselor?

In the event of a tie vote,
Walden Thoreau Schmidt,

as company founder, has the
unlimited right to cast

an additional vote
to break said tie.

Boo-yah!

Hold on. I am not voting until
my lawyer looks at this.

Me neither.

Suit yourself.

This isn't over, Walden.

Love you, sweetie.

Love you too, Mom.

Hey, Walden,
what's the company policy

on board members
dating each other?

You want to date
my ex-wife?

No, no, that would be weird.

My mother?

No, no.

Then what are
you talking about?

I just wanna be clear
on the policy.

Last thing we need
is a sexual harassment lawsuit.

Am I right, sweet cheeks?

âª Men. âª

Hi. Can I get
you something?

Uh, yes, I am
celebrating a new job.

What's your most
expensive drink?

We have a Pierre Benoit cognac
for a thousand dollars a shot.

Good to know.
I'll have a light beer.

Hello, Alan.

Oh, hi.

Hi, Alan.

Oh, Bridget. Hi.

Isn't this a happy
coincidence,

the three of us running
into each other?

Listen, ladies,
with all due respect,

I've been instructed
not to discuss

any company business outside
of the boardroom.

What makes you think
we want to talk about business?

Aw, come on.

I may have been born yesterday,

but I was up late last night.

What does that
even mean?

It means...

I don't know.
I heard it in a movie.

May I help you ladies?

I'll have
a Pierre Benoit cognac.

Oh, make that two.

Separate checks.

Alan, isn't there
any way we can work

together on this
board vote?

I'm sorry, but I'm loyal
to your son.

Well, so am I.

I'm trying to protect
him from himself.

And I would think an
intelligent, successful,

good-looking man like
would see that.

Well, that's very flattering,

but I'm afraid
you've overplayed your hand.

No one would call me successful.

Forget it, Robin.

I knew he wouldn't go for it.

I'll call you later.

Okay.

Eh, we had to try.

I understand-- there's
a lot money at stake.

Mmm! That's what
I always imagined

Gisele Bundchen
would taste like.

What do you say we
forget about business

and just enjoy the evening?

Well, I'm all for
enjoying the evening,

but your hand is on
my business.

Would you like me
to move it?

Yes.

Slowly and in
a circular fashion.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Hey. Where you been?

Just going out clothes shopping.

Can't be a corporate board
member wearing khakis

and polo shirt
I got at a swap meet

from some
dead guy's wife, right?

Nice!

Is that Barney's?

Sears.

What are you doing?

I'm just looking over
this mobile gaming startup

I want to invest in
when I get my company back.

Right, right.

Oh, did you see the look
on my mom's face

when I sprung you on her?

Actually, I wasn't looking
at her face when I...

sprung.

And-And why do you even want
to invest in more companies?

You've got me money than
you're ever gonna use.

So?

So maybe it's time
to move on.

You know, do something else.

Learn to dance.

Since when do you care
about how I spend my money?

Well, technically,
it's the company's money,

and now that I'm on
the board,

I have a fiduciary duty
to the stockholders.

Fiduciary duty.

You're adorable.

I'm serious--
you need to slow down

on the spending
for your own good.

Wait a minute.

You haven't by chance been
talking to my mother

and my ex-wife, have you?

What?! Me?!

Talk?! Them?!

What?!

Because if you're
not gonna support me,

there are plenty of other people
who would be happy

to take place
and your $50,000 stipend.

Now, hold on--
I think I bring

a unique skill set
to the table.

Jake, do you want to be on
the board of my company?!

Hell, yeah!

Oh, come on.
I'm smarter than him!

Listen, Alan, I put you on

the board of my company
for a reason,

and I need to know
you have my back.

Of course I have your back.

What could possibly make me
even consider betraying you?

What...?

Great.

Certainly not some
expensive cognac

and a happy ending in
the men's room.

âª Men. âª

So, Alan, are we all set
for tomorrow's board meeting?

Boy, I want to say yes...

What do you mean?

I thought we had
an understanding.

Gee, I wish I
could say we do...

Alan, sweetie,
are you saying

that we can't count on you?

I knew it!
Walden got to him.

Hang on, Bridget.
He's a reasonable man.

Right, Alan?

That's not gonna work.

I masturbated three times
before got here.

All right, let's cut
to the chase.

What would it take to make you
change your mind?

Oh, really?
You want to play that game?

Okay...

How about
a brand-new red Porsche?

I just love being inside you.

Hi.

Hey, hi.

That's a nice car.

Oh, well, uh,

that's what you get when
you save your nickels.

That's three million
nickels, Alan.

It's a lease?

Is there something
you want to tell me

about the board meeting
tomorrow?

I'm weak.

I'm so very weak.

It's okay.

That's why I chose you.

All right, there's
a motion on the table.

Shall Walden Schmidt
be restored to president

of Walden Loves Bridget
Enterprises?

Right after the meeting,
I'm changing the name.

Thank you.

I vote nay.

Nay.

Aye.

Aye.

What?
Are you kidding me?!

Okay, okay, if it
makes you feel any better,

you're not the first women
I've disappointed.

Here, you can have the car back.

It's out of gas.

And unfortunately, Robin,

I can't return what you gave me,
but I really enjoyed it.

I should have known
you had a hand in this.

All right, I use my founder's
vote to break the tie,

I am reinstated
as president,

and as my first
official act,

I would like to change
the name of the company

to Walden Loves Alan
Enterprises.

Oh!

This meeting's adjourned.
Shall we?

With pleasure.

Oh, it was lovely
to see you again.

Hey, hey, hey!

âª Men. âª

You know, as long
as we're in the business

of investing in
high-tech ideas--

a while back, I invented
a little chiropractic device

that allows people
to adjust their own backs.

No kidding?

Yeah. I call it
"Accu-Crack."

Catchy.

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

Only problem is there's
a caulking gun,

a reggae band and a porn site
with the same name.

Why don't you just change
the name?

Mm-- I would,

but I already printed out
30,000 brochures.

Well, tell me about the product.

How does it work?

Oh, really, really simple.

It's two hard rubber balls
attached to a stick

that you lay on and move
up and down your spine.

How is that high-tech?

Uh... we'd sell it
over the Internet?

Well, I'll certainly
consider it.

Really?

Please don't push this, Alan.

Oh, oh!

As agreed upon.

Oh, oh, is this what
I think it is?

Yeah, a deal's a deal.

I get your vote on the board
of my company,

you get your name on the deed
to the house.

Oh, my God.

Congratulations.

Does this mean
I can borrow against it?

- No.
- Sell it?

- No.
- Have the big bedroom upstairs?

No.

Can I tell women it's my house?

Why would you stop now?

Life is good.

Ooh! Oops!

Uh-oh...

Oh, crap! Oh, crap!
Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

Oh, crap! Oh, crap!
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

.......... ********** ..........

Walden, are you almost ready?

Almost.

How is it possible that I am
always ready before you are?

Hey, it takes a lot of work

to make it look
like I don't care how I look.

Please, let's go.
I'm starving.

Just give me a minute.
I'm having a bad beard day.

Is there such a thing
as a good beard day?

Absolutely.

Usually I wake up,
and it's all soft and fluffy,

but I must have
slept on it wrong,

'cause this side's, like,
flat and listless.

Oh, if it's causing
you such problems,

why don't you
just shave it off?

I thought you loved my beard.

No, I never
said that.

Then why'd you go out
with me in the first place?

I don't judge a person
by what's on the surface.

Yeah, but yet you're asking me
to shave my surface.

Yes, please.

Wow.

I mean, is there anything else

about me that's not
working for you?

As long as you ask,

I'm not crazy about the
Jennifer Aniston hairdo.

Okay. This is...

I'm-I'm... I'm a little...
I'm a little confused here.

I thought you liked
the way I looked.

Oh, I do. I do.

I just think I'd like it better
if the ratio of hair to face

was more on the
face side of things.

Well, I will definitely
give it some thought.

Oh. I don't want you to do
anything you don't want to do.

Although, to be fair, I did
remove some hair for you.

After I almost
choked to death.

Okay, just need to post
a profile picture,

and let the dating begin.

Whoa.

To Catch a Predator.

Hello, sailor!

Wow. More chins
than a Chinese phone book.

Hey. We're heading out.

Have a nice dinner.

What are you going
to do tonight?

Well, I don't want
to jinx myself,

but I'm hoping to rub one out
and be asleep by 10:00.

Rub one out?

Oh, he's gonna wait
till we leave,

watch some porn
and masturbate.

Ah.

Oh. Ick.

You know what?

Don't just hang
out here alone.

Why don't you just
join us for dinner?

Oh, no, no, no. I don't want
to be a third wheel.

You two kids have a great time.

Thank you.
No.

We insist.

Tell him, Zoey.

Do join us, won't you?

Great.

Rain check.
Where we eating?

I was thinking about trying out
that new Italian place on PCH.

Ooh, really? Italian?
That's kind of heavy.

What are you
in the mood for?

Oh, no, no. It's your night.
I'm just tagging along.

I was rather looking
forward to Italian, so...

Well, you heard her.
The queen wants pasta.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh

âª Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh
âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah.
âª Men.

Darling, you have
some crumbs.

Oh. Thank you.

Mm.

That's another advantage
of having a beard.

After dinner, you always have
something left to snack on.

Charming.

She's not crazy
about the facial hair.

Oh, are you kidding?

He looks so rugged and sexy.

Grr.

Well, if it's such
a wonderful look,

why don't you grow a beard?

Oh, I tried.
Grew in patchy.

I looked like a possum on chemo.

Oh. Well, I think
most women would agree

that men look
much more attractive

when they're
properly groomed.

Really?

I've always been
properly groomed,

and all it's gotten me
is two divorces

and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Oh. Ick.

Alan, check out the bar.

Oh. Wow.

She looks fantastic.

Who's that?

It's Alan's old girlfriend.

You're joking.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing. Well done. Well done.

Alan, go say hello to her.

Oh, I don't know. I mean,
as much as I'd like to see her,

I'm not sure
she still wants to see me.

Uh, it didn't end well.

What happened?

Did she catch you
rubbing one out?

- Did I say that right?
- That was perfect.

Yeah? Okay.

Just go say hello to her.

Well, guess
it couldn't hurt.

I mean, she does look
a little pathetic

just sitting there
all by herself

waiting to get hit on
by some loser.

By all means,
save her from that.

All right, wish me luck.

Good luck.

Go get 'em.

Seriously, what's
wrong with her?

Hey, stranger.

Alan!

Hi! How have you been?

Uh, good. Good. You?

Real good.

Well, you look beautiful.

Thank you.

Yeah, I've been
working out.

Good.

Good, good. So, uh, what are
you doing here all by yourself?

- Oh, well...
- Sorry.

I don't think that valet has
ever driven a Ferrari before.

Alan, this is
my friend Dylan.

Dylan, this is Alan.

- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Alan.

Uh, Dylan, huh?

Uh, named after Bob?

No, named after my dad.

He was named after Bob.

Okay. Okay.

Uh, well, it was
nice to meet you.

Uh, Lyndsey, it's always
great to see you.

Um, I-I should get
back to my date.

Yeah, Walden's trying to
set me up with his baby sister.

She's very pretty.

Oh, yeah, she's okay.

Uh, it's a very
close family.

Seems overly complicated.

What?

Why don't they just make chips
with the dip already on 'em?

Dude.

Dude...

that's a million-dollar idea.

What is?

Pre-dipped chips.

See, that's
a million-dollar idea.

What's a million-dollar idea?

It's an idea
worth a million dollars.

Boy, I wish I had one of those.

I can't believe they brought
back Beavis and Butt-Head.

Yeah. Those guys are,
like, too stupid to live.

Uh-oh. That's my dad.

Quick, give me
that air freshener.

This is bug spray, dude.

Says it's for roaches.

Perfect.

Just forget about her, Alan.

I'm sure Zoey has some single
friends she can fix you up with.

No, I don't. Sorry.

I just can't get over
how young the guy is.

Well, a clean-shaven face
will do that for a man.

Well, thanks again for dinner.

I really thought
I was gonna eat both lobsters.

You really don't have
any single friends?

Shh. Just
keep walking.

Hey.

Hey.
Hey.

Oh, my God!

Is that bug spray?

Yeah, we were just
getting rid of some roaches.

Maybe we need
to call an exterminator.

I think we need
to call Domino's.

Mind if I hang out
with you guys?

Sure.

Who's dumber
than Beavis and Butt-Head?

Oh, hey, Eldridge,
I ran into your mom tonight.

Really? Was she with Dylan?

Yeah, yeah.
Have you met him?

What's he like?
Is it serious?

I doubt it. He's gay.

What? He's gay?

Oh, yeah, big poof.

Always hugging me
a little too long.

Wait. Are we talking
about the guy with the Ferrari?

Yeah. Dylan.

I once saw him wearing
my mom's underwear.

Oh, well, that doesn't mean
he's gay. He...

He might just like
pretty things.

Um, does your mom
ever mention me?

Yeah.

Yeah, all the time.
She really misses you.

You should stop by some time.

Huh.

Well, it's not too late.

Maybe I'll wander over there
and carpe me some diem.

Way to get rid of him.

Thanks.

Was any of it true?

Not a word.

What does "carpe me
some diem" mean?

It's French
for "bang your mom."

âª Men.

Mmm.
Mmm. Hang on.

Beard.

Oh, please.

I know what you're
trying to do.

What?

Do you really hate
my beard that much?

"Hate" is a very strong word.

But, yeah, I hate it.

Okay, I don't
understand.

We've been going out
for a couple months.

Why is it all of a
sudden the problem?

All right.

This is probably
going to sound very shallow,

but there's a cocktail party
at my office this weekend,

and since I'm on the fast track
to make partner,

I'd rather not show up
with Hipster Jesus.

You're right, that
did sound shallow.

I'm sorry.

But if it's that
important to you

and the people you work with--
who obviously have never heard

of Steve Wozniak,
Richard Branson

or freakin'
Santa Claus...

I'll do it.

Really?

Yes, really.

And you'll cut the hair, too?

Aw, man!

Fine.

Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

Now, what can I do
to make you happy?

Well...

Besides that.
Aw.

Oh, Dylan!

Oh, yes, Dylan!

Oh! Yes!

Dylan! Yes!

Dylan!

Big poof, my ass.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Yes! Yes!
I hate that kid.

Yes, Dylan! Yes!

âª Men.

So why'd you quit
being a hairdresser?

They shut down the prison.

You were in prison?

No, I was
a prison barber.

Which, to be honest,
was mostly about lice control

and trading sex for cigarettes.

What's going on?

I'm getting cleaned up
for Zoey's office party.

Wow. So you finally caved.

I did not cave.

Just want to make her happy.

Oh, yeah, I get it.

I've spent my whole life

doing what I'm told
to make women happy.

No, Zoey didn't order me
to shave or cut my hair.

It's my choice.

Yeah, and when I was
married to Judith,

it was my choice to get
a vasectomy, a new kitchen

and a Labradoodle with diarrhea.

Ooh.

Excuse me.

Hey, Lyndsey.

All right, Samson,
what do you want?

Look pretty for your cell mate
or the death row special?

Yeah, yeah,
it was good to see you, too.

W-What?

Yeah, I-I would love
to-to get together.

Uh, tomorrow night?

Great, I-I'll see you then.

Huh.

She's dating a young,
good-looking stud with money.

Why would she want to see me?

Maybe she needs a kidney.

âª Men.

Surprise.

Walden, you promised.

I know. I'm sorry.

I just, I couldn't do it.

Then why did you
tell me you would?

Because I wanted you
to stop nagging me.

Are you calling me a nag?

No, I did not say that.

I said you were nagging.

What's the difference?

Obviously the "ging."

Walden, you gave me your word.

I-I was gonna go through
with it, and then I realized

this is who I am, and if
you don't like me for who I am,

then what's the point?

The point is you lied to me!

N-No, it wasn't a lie.

I meant it when I said it.

But you said it
to stop me "nagging!"

That's right.

No, that's wrong!

No, what you were trying
to make me do-- that's wrong.

Now, are we going to your
stupid office party or what?

Okay, so I guess you're
going with the "or what!"

You know what, thank you
for showing me your true colors

before I fell
hopelessly in love with you!

Uh-oh.

Excuse me?

âª Men.

I have missed you
so much.

I missed you, too.

Uh, maybe this is the
wrong time to ask this,

but don't you
have a boyfriend?

We broke up.

So you left
Dylan for me?

Don't be silly.

Wait, wait.

So-So he left you?

No.

O-Okay, I'm confused.

Do you really want to know?

Actually, I
think I'm good.

Do you have any idea
how exhausting it is

going out with a gorgeous
25-year-old man?

If I said "yes," this would be
a whole different conversation.

Let me give you an example.

Every morning, I had to get up
an hour before him

to put on makeup
so he wouldn't open his eyes

and think he just
nailed his mom.

Nobody wants that.

And that's not
the worst part.

A man his age wants
to have sex constantly.

And that's a problem?

After a certain point, yes.

There's not enough
cranberry juice in the world

to put out the fire
that's burning between my legs.

Um...

Well, the fire between
my legs just went out.

I mean, the entire time
I was with him,

I walked out of
the bedroom backwards

so he wouldn't see my ass.

What's wrong
with your ass?

Oh, Alan.

That's why
I've missed you so much.

I-I don't get it.

Your standards are
so much lower than Dylan's.

I don't have to worry about
disappointing you.

I do set a low bar.

Or worry about you leaving me
for a younger woman.

- Why not?
- You can't get one.

And you want to know
the best part?

It gets better?

I could sit here
and fart like a buffalo,

and you'd still
want to be with me.

Well, with age
comes wisdom.

A fella learns to breathe
through his mouth.

Come here, you.

You're testing
me, aren't you?

I am.

Hang on.

Whew! That's a dead buffalo.

- Oh, hey, Zoey.
- Hi, Alan.

Is Walden here?

Uh, you know, I'm not sure.

I haven't seen him all day.

Uh, Walden,
you up there?!

Coming!

Uh, oh, Lyndsey, Zoey.

Zoey, Lyndsey.
Hi.

Hi.

We just got
back together.

Really?

Oh, did that lovely boy die?

Zoey?

Hmm?

Oh, my God.

Look at you.

You like it?

Like it?

I'm tempted to rub one out.

But why?

Well, it turns out, when you
weren't nagging me to do it,

I wanted to.

What are you
doing here?

I came to apologize for nagging.

I had no right
to try and change you.

Thank you.

I also hoped you might elaborate

on that "falling in love"
comment.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

All right then, come with me.

Where are we going?

I want to test drive
this new face of yours.

Oh.

Hop on!

That poor girl.

Yeah, he looks younger
and prettier than before.

She's gonna have to hold in her
farts till the Fourth of July.

Mm-hmm.

âª Men.

Here's your
cranberry juice.

Thank you.

So, uh, how will you know

when your lady problems
have cleared up?

I'll be able to pee
without screaming.

Thanks so much
for letting me use your loo.

Oh, any time.

I know it's silly,
but I just don't want Walden

to hear any of
my bathroom noises.

I totally understand.

Thank you. Night.

Good night.

Dylan took me to Hawaii
for a week, I didn't crap once.

Is that so?

Thank God he fell asleep
on the flight back.

Why's that?

Gave me a chance to unload.

I put the first-class lavatory
totally out of commission.

Really?
Yeah.

Stewardess thought
it was a terrorist attack.

All right, good night.

Yeah, o-okay.

Good night.

They don't have what we have.

No, they don't.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men âª

Oh, God.

Walden.

Wake up.
You have to go.

What?

My daughter's going
to be up soon.

I don't want her to
find you in here.

Okay...

I'm awake.

Now get dressed.

All right.

Um... before I go,

I do have that
morning phenomenon

that sometimes
happens to fellas.

You know,
in the morning.

I don't care about
your erection, okay?

Okay, fine, fine.

I just thought
that I would point it out

since it is...

you know, pointing out.

Very impressive.

Now, skedaddle before
Ava wakes up, okay?

You know, at some point,
I'm going to have to meet her.

At some point, yes,
but not today.

Yeah, well, I kind of feel
like I already know her.

I mean, I'm certainly familiar

with her port of entry
into this world.

Yes. Ha ha.

Now, get out.

Mummy?

Uh... closet!

Really? The closet?
Isn't that kind of clichÃ©?

Oh, God. In!

I want to snuggle.

Good idea!

Let's snuggle in your room.

No, here.

Here. Of course.

Um, good.

Now, close your eyes,

and Mummy will give you
a super-duper snuggle.

Mwah!

Are your eyes closed?

Uh-huh.

Are Winston's eyes closed?

He's not real, Mummy.

All righty.

Get out!

All done.

Now, what do you say

we make some pancakes?

Yay!

Pancakes! Pancakes!
Pancakes! Pancakes!

Pancake train!
Pancakes!

- Pancakes! Pancakes!
- Pancakes! Pancakes!

I like pancakes.

I left Winston
on your bed.

I could totally be Spider-Man.

I think I broke
my morning phenomenon.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah.
âª Men.

Can I ask you a
personal question?

Does it involve money,
drugs or pregnancy?

No.

How can I help you, my son?

You and Eldridge's mom
are dating again, right?

Right.
You think you'll ever get married?

Uh, well, actually,
we talked about that

and decided the only
reason to do it

would be if we wanted
to have more kids,

and since we both...

...had so much success
the first time,

there's really no point.

Oh.

What brought that up?

Oh. Me and Eldridge
were thinking

it would be cool if
we were brothers,

so that we could switch
places to fool people.

That only works
if you're twins, Jake.

How do you know
for sure I'm Jake?

Morning.
Morning.

What happened to you?

I was perched on a dresser,
and I fell on my penis.

Oh. I hate when
that happens.

Uh... uh, dare I ask?

Uh, yeah, I was hiding
from Zoey's daughter.

Oh. Still doesn't want you
to meet her?

No.

Well, it's not unusual
for single moms

to be protective of their kids.

And then, when you are
introduced to them,

you're "Uncle Alan, who's on
his way back to Cleveland,

"and you don't have
to remember his name

because you'll never,
ever see him again."

What do you do to women
to piss them off so much?

If I knew,
don't you think I'd stop?

Well, the daughter stuff

isn't the only thing
bothering me about Zoey.

Oh, I thought you guys
were getting along great.

Well, we are...
most of the time.

It's just...

Have you ever been
in a relationship

where you're really
into each other,

but the sex
isn't everything it could be?

Oh, sure.

Uh, except for the
"really into each other" part.

It's not that the sex is bad,
Mm-hmm.

it's just that...

lately, it seems like she
could just take it or leave it.

Oh... "Take it or leave it."

Boy, I know that song.

But my philosophy is,

as long as she's taking it,
I'm not leaving.

You know what she said to me
last night, after we had sex?

"That was nice.

Now let's do something fun."

Well, I suppose
that's better than,

"Put your pants on so we can get
back to the family reunion."

You're kidding, right?

Oh, she was just
a cousin by marriage.

So have you actually talked
to Zoey about your problem?

No. I was just hoping
it would just get better.

Oh, no, no, no. Take it from me.

There are two things
in long-term relationships

that never get better
by themselves.

One is sex.

What's the other one?

Does it matter?

It's all arranged.

Ava's going to be
spending tonight with her dad.

Great.

So sleepover at my house?

Sounds heavenly.

Although I don't know
how much sleeping we'll do.

Cheeky monkey.

Shall I bring around
some Chinese?

Hey, the more, the merrier.

Ha, ha.

You know, if there's
anything I can do

to, you know,
make you happier...

What on Earth
are you talking about?

I just... I couldn't help
but notice...

I can't even say it.

Come on, Walden.

You can tell me anything.

All right.

The sex.

You don't... you don't seem
to be enjoying the sex.

Okay, I can't talk about that.

Okay, y-you said we could talk
about anything.

Yeah, but not about that.

And certainly not on a computer.

Why? Nobody's listening.

I'm sorry.

I'm-I'm very uncomfortable
talking about...

you know...

No offense, but you don't seem

that comfortable
doing it, either.

You're still talking about it.

I-I-I mean,
because if you're not,

I mean, there are...
there are things that we can do.

There are things we can try.

Like?

I don't know,
like role-playing.

Role-playing?

Yeah. You know...

"Hey, lady,
I'm here to clean the pool."

But I don't have a pool.

No, it's an imaginary pool.

How is you
cleaning an imaginary pool

supposed to be erotic?

Okay, okay,
just forget the pool.

I... all I'm saying is-is that,

if there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

Thank you for your concern,

but I'm perfectly
satisfied with our...

carnal interludes.

Really?

Carnal interludes?

Well, what do you
want me to call it?

It doesn't matter.
I mean, the distance

between "carnal interludes"
and what I would call it

isn't really susceptible
to compromise.

All right, listen,
I have to run and take Ava

to her father's,
so I'll see you tonight, yes?

Great.

Walden, believe me,

I am fine and dandy
with our...

Carnal interludes.

See you.

Everything okay

with you and
Mary Poppins?

Were you eavesdropping?

If I don't eavesdrop,

I've got nothing
to tweet about.

The problem is she's English.

Stiff upper lips and all that.

You should date
a nice Polish girl.

You don't say.

Oh, yeah.

Those Commies,
they're all freaks.

Sex is the only thing

they didn't have to stand
in line and wait for.

Good to know.

I think I'll stick with Zoey.

I just wish I could
get her to relax.

You know, let go.

Me, I'm just the opposite.

I can get off
leaning against the dryer

with a couple of sneakers in it.

Is that why my Nikes
are so clean?

Win-win.

Listen, if you want to loosen up
the Duchess of Dull-In-Sack,

you might try slipping her
one of my special brownies.

I got a fresh batch
in the fridge.

You know, for my glaucoma.

Thank you, but I'm...

I don't want to have to get Zoey
loaded to enjoy sex with me.

Suit yourself.

Doesn't want to get her loaded.

What's the matter
with kids today?

âª Men.

Aw.

That was a lovely movie.

Yeah, that Hugh Grant
is really something.

Something wrong?

No. Why?

Usually, at this point
in the evening,

you start
getting frisky.

Frisky?

Randy.

Randy?

All right. "Horny."

Made you say it.

Is that an invitation
to get frisky?

If you want.

If you want.

Well, I want
if you want.

No, no, I want
you to want

because you want,
not because I want.

Okay, I've lost
the thread.

Now, are we gonna
do this or not?

Only if you want.

Oh, Walden, why are you
making this so difficult?

Because I... it's not fun for
me unless you're having fun.

All right.

Let's have some fun.

Oh, look.

It's the pool cleaning man.

Come to clean my pool,
have you?

Okay, that's...
that's enough.

My, what a big chlorine bottle
you've got.

O-Okay, please stop.

Let's just stop.

You sure?

Yes.

Oh, okay.

We'll go
to sleep, then.

Do you like brownies?

What?

Is this another game?

The sexy pastry chef.

No. No.

Come to butter
my baking pan, have you?

No. No.

No. Uh... no.

No.
Okay.

It's just that...

Berta made these...
pot brownies,

and I just thought maybe,

if we had one, that we
could relax a little bit.

Oh... Tried that once
at university.

Had a bit of a giggle.

Is that a yes?

I don't see any harm in it.

What was that?

Do you hear police sirens?

I hear police sirens.

Dear God, they're from France!

Bummer.

Oh, no, they're
getting closer!

Looks like someone else
found the brownies.

Oh, good, you saw her, too.

Zoey!

Zoey! Zoey!

Okay, she's definitely
not on the beach.

Don't worry, man,
I'm sure she's somewhere.

That's true.

Everybody's somewhere.

Whoa, that is seriously deep.

Slice?

Ah, thank you.

Okay.

We got to find Zoey before
something horrible happens.

This is very good.

Anyway, we should split up.

A hundred bucks
to the man who finds her.

Hundred bucks?

We're in.

Cool.

Maybe she's on the beach.

Zoey! Zoey!

Okay.

We have to find Zoey
before he does.

Zoey!

Where would you go if you were
stoned and freaking out?

Taco Bell.

Excellent.

Let's go.
Zoey!

I'm right behind you.

Zoey! Zoey!

âª Men.

Mmm...

Hello.

Mm, hello, Alan.

What's going on?

Just a little snack.

I see.

Uh, where's Walden?

Beats me.

Hey, you know what's very weird?

You Americans call these chips,
we call them crisps.

And what we call chips,
you call...

French fries.

Oh, don't get me
started on the French.

Yeah.

Um, did you have
one of Berta's brownies?

Indeed I did.

I did indeed.

Indeed I did a doody-deedy.

Hey,

where's Walden?

We're supposed to be
having good sex.

Oh, is that so?

Mm.

He thinks I don't enjoy it,
but it's just hard for me

to give myself to a man
unless I trust him completely.

I certainly understand that.

But once I do,
I have orgasm after orgasm,

especially if you
spank my bottom

while I ride you like a Vespa.

Okay. I'll-I'll try
to pass that along.

Um...

Okay, I'm going
to bed now.

Night.
Hmm. Mm.

By the way,
I know I haven't always

been very warm to you.

Well, that's true.

It's only 'cause I don't
care for you very much.

Understood.

Nighty-night.

Good night.

Nice change of pace
hearing it with an accent.

"I just don't
care for you very much."

It's classy.

Oh, hey.

Oh, hey,
there you are.

Zoey's looking
for you.

She's here?

Yeah, she
went to bed.

Oh. Thank God.

I better go check on her.

But first, ice cream.

Good news! We found Zoey!

âª Ta-da!

Which one of you is
the billionaire looking for me?

âª Men.

I'm so sorry
about last night.

Don't be silly.

I'm just glad you didn't
end up in a French prison.

I hope you don't think
I'm a lost cause.

No, no.

I do like... you know.

Glad to hear.

Don't worry, I will not stop
until I hear Paul Revere.

I beg your pardon?

You know, the
British are coming!

The British
are coming!

Hello.

Nigel, what are
you doing here?

I had to bring Ava back early.

Hello. Nigel Pierce.

Walden Schmidt.

Nigel is my ex-husband.

A role I relish.

I need to catch
a plane to London,

so you'll have to have Ava
for the weekend.

And what if I have plans?

Yes, I can see your plans.

Mummy, Daddy said he
can't take me to the zoo.

Oh, wonderful,
just wonderful.

Are you and Daddy
going to fight?

No. Mummy will take you
to the zoo instead of Daddy.

Brilliant, make me the bad guy.

Oh, no one made you the bad guy,
you were born to it.

Uh, you know what, Ava?

I'm a little thirsty.

Maybe you could show me where
I could get a glass of water.

Is it all right, Mummy?

Yeah. Good idea.

Come on, then.

They're gonna
fight now.

Yeah, I know.

So this is what you
prefer now, hmm?

Underwear models?

He happens to be a billionaire.

Yes, well, I happen to be
107th in line to the throne.

Here's your water.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

Oh, whoa!

This is the best water
I have ever had.

Did you make this yourself?

No, silly, it came
out of the fridge.

Oh.

Well, then cheers.

Mmm.

I'm a queen.

You are?

Queen Ava.

Well, then what am I?

I have no idea.

Walden Schmidt, Your Majesty.

Pleased to meet you.

I shall call you Sir Schmidt.

Oh! At your service.

Oh!

Oh! Oh!

Well, you two seem
to be getting along.

Can Sir Schmidt come
with us to the zoo?

Sir Schmidt?

Hmm. I don't know.

Please?

He's my loyal subject.

Well, I suppose, if he wants.

I live to do
the queen's bidding.

All right,
go and get your jacket.

Yay!

Sir Schmidt?

My grandfather shortened it
from Schmidt-a-Lot.

Oh, goodness.

That was quite a day.

Yeah. It was fun, wasn't it?

It was.

Is she still sleeping?

She's comatose.

Here, let me
take her.

Shh.

Oh, dear, you have a bit
of drool on your shoulder.

Oh, that's not a problem.

My housekeeper has a lot of
experience with drool stains.

Ah. I'm gonna go
and put her down.

Be right back.

Hey, Jake.

Really? You found Zoey.

That's great.

Thank you.

Little dude's got to lay off
the brownies.

She's absolutely
knackered.

It was a long day.

You were just
wonderful with her.

Thanks.

Well, I guess
I better head home.

I think not.

What's happening?

It's very,
very simple.

I'm going to take
you into my bedroom

and bang you like
a snare drum.

Yippee!

âª Men.

Hey!

Oh, hey.
Where you been?

I went to the zoo with Zoey
and her little girl.

Wow! So you finally
met the daughter.

Yep.
Might make it tough

if the relationship
doesn't work out.

Why wouldn't it work out?

Well, you know, the lack of

sexual chemistry
you were talking about.

Oh, no, we're way past that.

Oh. So she opened up
about her trust issues?

Trust issues?

No, zoos make her horny.

Really? You think that's it?

Yep.

Next weekend, we're going to
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

Uh...

hello.

You Walden?

Yeah.

I Zoey.

Ah.

It's nice
to meet you.

Well?

Keep looking.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, God.

That feels so good.

Where'd you learn to do that?

Chiropractic school?

Long before that.

When I was a kid,
I had to do this for my mom.

Had to?

If I wanted dessert.

Oh, poor baby.

Tell you what, when you're
done with my other foot,

I'll give you a
little dessert.

Thank you, Mommy.

Hey.

Hey!

Oh, hey.
How was the opera?

Magnificent.

Il Trovatore.

Walden cried.

- Oh.
- Oh.

Come on, a guy
in a leotard and a skirt

realizes he chopped
his own brother's head off.

That's heartbreaking.

I keep trying to take Lyndsey
to the opera, but she won't go.

I'm sorry,

I'm just not a fan of fat people
singing in a foreign language

for two and
a half hours.

Well, opera's not for everyone.

To appreciate it requires
a refined taste

and a certain amount
of education.

Whoa.

You did not
just say that.

Say what?

I am plenty refined,

and I happen to have
an Associate of Arts degree

from Santa Monica
Community College.

I'm sorry, I wasn't
trying to be pejorative.

What's that supposed to mean?

Uh, pejorative is having
a derogatory...

I know what
the word means!

Sorry, sorry.

What's community college?

Is that like
a sort of trade school?

Let's leave it alone.

We've already seen
one beheading tonight.

Where did you go to college?

Oxford?

Only for two years.

Aw, did you flunk out?

No, I transferred
to Harvard.

Harvard.

The Santa Monica
Community College of the East.

What do you say we go
get ready for bed?

Yeah, good idea.

âª Mi chiamano Mimi

âª Il perchÃ¨ non so
sola, mi fo. âª

I also took a semester off
to study opera in Florence.

That's in Italy.

Wow.

That is one talented lady.

And by "talented"
I mean annoying,

and by "lady" I mean bitch.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh

âª Men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh

âª Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh
âª Men, men, manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah.
âª Men.

âª Men.

"Fat people singing
in a foreign language."

Can you believe her?

No. It's unbelievable.

Maybe she'd be
more appreciative of

fat people singing
in her native language.

No to Pavarotti,
yes to Cee Lo Green.

Mm. Forget you?

Forget her.

And then she has the nerve to
insult me simply 'cause I have

a modicum of sophistication
and good taste.

Mm, you do
taste good.

I know what she thinks.

She thinks I'm snobbish
and condescending.

Mm, but you're not.

No, I'm not.

It's a shame, really.

So much I could teach
the poor girl.

It's her loss.

God knows what Alan
sees in her.

Yeah, he could
totally do better.

No, he couldn't;
he's a complete loser.

What are you talking about?

Um, you said...

Never mind.

"Refined taste."

I'd like to punch
her refined face in.

And you could;
you hit hard.

You know
what her problem is?

She was born with
all the advantages

and now she thinks
she's better than everyone else.

Like her poop doesn't stink.

Your poop
stinks, honey.

Thank you.

Especially after
Indian food.

That is a real working-class
stank right there.

Boy, I am so turned
on right now.

What could Walden
possibly see in that,

in that stuck-up
English muffin?

Maybe it's her
nooks and crannies.

What?

Uh, you know,
English muffin.

Uh, nooks
and crannies.

For the butter.

Or margarine, as
the case may be.

Are you saying
you like her body?

Oh, no, no.

No, it's your
body that I love.

You've got the
stinky poop.

Be honest with me.

Have I not been entirely civil
and charming to her?

You have.

Then why does she give me
that attitude?

Who know...?
She's crazy.

Well, I wouldn't call her crazy;
she's certainly unpleasant.

That's what I meant.

Unpleasant.

Are you humoring me
just so I'll have sex with you?

No. I took you to the opera
so you would have sex with me.

You're terrible.

I'm trying to be,

but there's a lot
of damn bows here.

âª Men.

Alan?

Yeah?

I'm sorry
I ruined our night.

That's okay.

No, it's not.

Let me make it up to you.

Really?

I get dessert?

Oh, Walden!

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
I don't believe it.

Do you know what she's doing?

Well, I think I have
a general idea.

She wants me to hear that.
Oh, my God!

She's rubbing my nose in it.

Sounds more like she's
rubbing his nose in it.

Oh, my God!

Two can play at that game.

Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

Oh, my God!

Oh!

Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

Making love to you.

Oh, my God!
Oh!

Oh!
You want me to help?

No, I got this.

Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

Oh!

Oh!

Oh!
Oh...!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

Oh, Alan!

Oh, Walden!

Oh!

Oh!

Oh!

âª Men.

Happy Valentine's
Day, darling.

You, too, sweetheart.

Sounded like you and Zoey
were getting an early start

on your celebrating last night.

Oh, yeah.

You and Lyndsey were making

quite a bit
of a racket yourselves.

Oh, you heard that?

It was kind of
hard not to.

Well, you know how it is.

Uh, you and I
are like the mailmen.

Rain or shine, we got to deliver
the old package.

Handle with care.

Express delivery.

No, wait, let me think
of another one.

This side up.

Oh.

That's good, that's good.

Oh, who am I kidding?

Last night was a complete sham.

What do you mean?

Zoey was trying to prove

some kind of point to Lyndsey.

So, all that noise was, uh...?

I had nothing to do with it.

Sorry.

Well, since we're being honest,
I should probably tell you...

I... had what was probably the
best sex of my life last night.

Good morning.

Huh?

Oh, morning.

Sleep well?

Terrific.

Good. I was afraid
we might have kept you awake.

Really?

I was worried we might have
kept you awake.

No, no, I slept like a baby.

Hope you didn't wet the bed.

They're laughing.

That's good, right?

Not that laugh.

That's the bad laugh.

Shame it has to be raining
on Valentine's Day.

Yeah, well, fortunately, the sun
is shining in Cabo San Lucas.

Thanks for the weather report.

Now here's Alan
with the sports.

I just meant
that's where Walden and I

are flying for dinner tonight.

Really?

Good luck with LAX.

Place is gonna be a madhouse.

That may well be.

Luckily, Walden's got
his private jet, so...

Of course he does.

Or they could fly down
on her private broom.

What are you and Alan
doing to celebrate?

Oh, don't worry
about us.

We have big plans.

Ooh.

Another festive foot rub?

Bad laugh?

As a matter of fact,
we're gonna spend the night

at a little bed-and-breakfast

outside Santa Barbara
where we're gonna

drink wine, read poetry

and have hot,
kinky sex.

Right, Alan?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Uh, sure.

The, uh, the holy trinity of
Valentine's Day:

sips, sonnets and sodomy.

That's interesting.

I can see you
as a drunken sodomite,

never imagined
you liking poetry.

Oh, no, no, I really do.

Here's a poem
you might appreciate.

"Roses are red,

"violets are blue,

"I'm a nice person

and you can bite my pale,
unrefined ass."

A lady doesn't bite.

Hmm.

She will however be happy

to make you wear that ass
as a bonnet.

What the hell?

Oh, my Lord.

Where's the road?

Probably inside
that giant sinkhole.

It looks like nobody's
going anywhere today.

Oh, smashing.

Swell.

Sodomy?

Sodom-ish.

âª Men.

âª Men.

They say the road might be
closed for another 48 hours.

And that's if
the rain lets up.

Better call my ex-husband,
let him know

I probably won't be
picking up Ava tomorrow.

Better call my son, tell
him I'll be home early.

Early?

I can't tell
him the truth.

If he knows I could
be gone for two days,

I might not have a
house when I get back.

Nice to have a relationship
with your child built on trust.

Excuse me?

I'm just saying,
I never lie to my daughter.

Really?
And how old is she?

She's six.
Aw.

They're so precious
at that age, aren't they?

They are.

Call me in a few years
when she's pierced and pregnant

with a pocket
full of 30-day chips.

There's no need to be crude.

Oh, so now I'm crude?

Not just now.

That's it.

Get ready for an
old-fashioned

trade school beat-down.

Oh! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

Slow down. Slow it down.
No! No!

Little Miss Muffet's going to
get knocked on her tuffet!

Oh, bring it on, Snooki!

Okay. Okay. No.

Baby, baby, no.

We're in a tough
situation here.

But this is a big house,
and we're all adults.

Yeah, some of us
older than others.

Oh!

Walden's right.
Walden's right.

We got to make
the best of this.

You know, we can, uh...
uh, we can play video games,

listen to music,
watch movies.

We're all going to die.

âª Men.

I'm sorry.

I'm not going to stay
in the same house

as that horrible wom.

Okay, first of all,
the road's closed,

so nobody's going anywhere.

And second of all, uh,
she's not that horrible.

What did you say?

I said, "The road's closed."

After that.

"Nobody's going anywhere."

Are you defending her?

Oh, come on.

It's a funny situation
when you think about it.

Two women who shouldn't be
anywhere near each other

trapped in a house
'cause of a silly rain storm.

That's a bad laugh.

âª Men.

Oh, great.

I just got my period.

Oh, joy.

My bloody Valentine.

I'm out of tampons.

You have to go get me some.

What?

Have you looked outside?

Yeah. It's raining.

This is not rain.

This is some sort
of biblical punishment.

There's only one flood
you need to be concerned about.

Why don't you just ask Zoey
for one?

Why don't I take
that light off your head

and give you
a quick colonoscopy?

At least now we know
why you're in such a bad mood.

What did you just say?

I said I'm going
to the drugstore

to buy you tampons.

You're so pretty.

Hey.
Hi.

Where you going?

I am going to swim
down to the drugstore

and bob for tampons.

Really?
In-in this weather?

What, are you out of your mind

Walden!

I'll come with you.

âª Men.

Looks like it's
starting to let up.

Yeah, this is
blowing over.

It's actually
kind of refreshing.

And we certainly
need the water.

It's weird
how people in L.A.

make such a big fuss
over a little rain.

That's the new
Smart car.

Doesn't look
so smart now.

Ah.

Hi.

Hi.

Do you happen to know
where Walden is?

I happen to not.

All right.

Well, where's Alan?

He went for a walk.

A walk?

Yeah, a walk.

That's how poor people
get from one place to another.

All right.

Mind if I share your wine?

I don't know if you'll like it.

It's domestic.

Alan bought it.

Actually, I quite like
California wine.

It's from Wisconsin.

Ah.

Well, desperate times.

Shame our girlfriends
don't get along, huh?

Yeah, if they don't start
playing nice with each other,

you're going to have to find
a new place to live.

No doubt.

Or I could find
another girlfriend.

âª Men.

Well, cheers.

Cheers.

For the record, I like
Walden very much.

He seems like a great guy.

Well, thank you.

Alan's...

Thank you.

So... what's your plan

for the young,
gorgeous billionaire?

I'm sorry. Plan?

Oh, come on.

Educated girl like you?

You got to have a plan
to nail him down.

I don't.

My feelings for Walden
are genuine.

I have no desire
to manipulate him

into some sort
of commitment.

Huh.

But if I did, what sort of plan
do you think might work?

Well, first thing I'd do
is throw out my diaphragm.

I'm on the pill.

All right.

Swap out those puppies
for Tic Tacs.

You know, it's
actually good

that Lyndsey sent me
to the drugstore.

'Cause now I can pick up
her Valentine's Day gift.

Nice!

Yeah, nothing says "I love you"
like Q-tips and stool softener.

I-I was thinking
of something more...

Alan!

Tell Jake I love him!

And buy Lyndsey tampons!

âª Men.

âª Men.

So, anyway, then we got married
and had my son, Eldridge.

How long after?

Actually, my water broke
during the ceremony.

Really put a crimp
in the reception.

Tell me about your ex.

Nigel.

Oh, God, how can
I describe Nigel?

Highly educated,
extremely cultured,

and as you Americans
might say...

"a total freakin' douche bag."

Really?

My ex-husband is,
as you Brits might say...

"a right bloody wanker."

Looks like we both
traded up, huh?

Yes, absolutely.

Cheers to us.
Mmm.

This is turning out to be
a pretty nice Valentine's Day.

It is, isn't it?

Thanks for the tampon,
by the way.

Oh, pleasure.

Appears our cycles
have synched up.

Yeah.

Probably why we haven't
seen the boys for a while.

We have been a bit out of sorts.

Mmm. Edgy.

Moody.

Bitchy.
Bitchy.

Oh, I do hope our
fellows are all right.

I'm sure they're fine.

Yeah.

Let me go!

Save yourself!
No!

If you go, I go!

Hey, Lyndsey.

Yeah, we haven't gotten
to the drugstore yet.

We're in a little bit
of a situation here.

All right.

What kind of ice cream?

Seriously, let me go.

.......... ********** ..........

Sorry, Nigel.

Dinner took longer
than I thought.

And now we are stuck in traffic.

Yeah, bumper to bumper.

Well, tell Ava I'll be there
in an hour, okay?

Okay.

Why didn't you
just tell him the truth?

Because I know
my ex-husband quite well,

and it would really upset him
if he found out

you flew me to San Francisco
in your private jet

just to have fried clams.

Yeah, you're right.

You shouldn't tell him.

Thank you.

I'll tell him.

I just wanted to do
something nice for you

before you went to London.

I'll only be gone a few weeks.

And I...

will miss you.

And I will miss you.

Whoa.
What was that?

Don't worry, it's normal.

Ahh! That's not normal!

God, oh, God, oh, God!

Zoey, I love you.

I don't want to die.

Did you hear me?
I said I love you.

I heard you,
and I said I don't want to die.

Sorry about that, Mr. Schmidt.

Just some clear air turbulence.

Should be smooth sailing
from here on out.

I doubt that.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,

âª Men

Aw...

What's sadder than
an empty bottle of wine?

Being the boyfriend of
a 40-year-old drunk soccer mom.

What?

Oh, I was just thinking

you might want
to slow down a little.

It's only wine, geez.

It's only been wine
since last July.

Hey, hey, that got
a three-star rating

in the Wal-Mart wine tracker.

What's the big deal?

So, I need a few glasses
to loosen me up.

Are you saying you
need to get loaded

in order to have sex with me?

I'm not loaded.
Fine.

But it doesn't hurt.

Hey, guys.

Wally! Want some wine?

No, I don't like to drink
when I'm depressed.

Wally, it's the best time
to drink.

Also when you're bored, lonely,
or just, you know,

too sober.

Why are you depressed?

I don't know.

It's kind of personal.

Okay, no problem.

What do you do when you

tell someone you love them
and they don't respond?

Drink.

Wait, you told Zoey
you love her?

Yeah, I thought the plane
was gonna crash,

and it just kind of came out,

along with a little squirt
of pee.

So, what did she say?

"Oh, God,
oh, God, I don't want to die."

Well, given the circumstance,
that's a legitimate response.

Sure, in the moment,

but what about
after the plane leveled out?

Well, what did she say then?

"Why do I smell pee?"

Then we just sat there
in silence

for the rest of the flight.

Should have drank.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna go
change my underwear

before I get diaper rash.

Wow, I feel bad for him.

Yeah.

I mean, you know, to tell
somebody you love them,

and just get no response.

Awful.

You know how I feel
about you, right?

Right.

You know how I
feel about you.

Oh, absolutely.

Still nice to hear
on occasion.

Oh, I agree.

I can do this
as long as you can, pal.

It's open.

Hey.

Can I talk to you for a minute?

Sure. What's up?

I didn't sleep at all
last night, man.

This Zoey stuff
is making me crazy.

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

I'm starting to wonder

if I should break
up with her,

Oh, hang on. I mean,
just because she didn't say,

"I love you," doesn't mean
she doesn't feel it.

You think?

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Some people have a hard time

articulating their feelings,

so they express them
in other ways.

Is that Lyndsey?

Yeah, she had a little
too much vino last night.

Anyway, I think you just have
to be patient with Zoey.

Yeah, I guess.

Sorry, I... I have a...
a hard time with...

people throwing up.

Try watching
and holding her hair.

It's just, Zoey's going
to England for a few weeks.

And-and I'm th...

I'm-I'm starting to
think if...

if I'm gonna end it,
now would be a good time.

Well, it...

Whoa.

You think I'd be
used to it by now.

No, no, no, don't...

Don't do anything hasty.

I can't... I... I can't
just leave th...

I can't just leave things
the way that they are.

Why don't you...
Why don't you go talk to her,

you know, and just put
your caaards on the table.

Yeah, maybe.

Crap,

now I've got to change my bra.

I-I-I mean, maybe we should
just give her some privacy.

Oh, God,
now it's coming out both ends!

Good idea.

Ava, you need
to get dressed.

Mummy has to go.

Walden.

De-e-lightful.

Nigel, di-isgusting.

What, are you here
to pick up your daughter?

I am.

Zoey tell you that we took
my jet to San Francisco

last night for fried clams?

No, she did not.

Well, we did.

Are you sharing this information
just to upset me?

Actually, I was hoping to make
you feel inadequate as well.

Oh, Walden.

What are you
doing here?

Nigel, I'm running late,

so will you for once please
make yourself useful

and help Ava get ready?

Well, only because
you asked so nicely.

Enjoy her.

Hi.

We need to talk.

Now? I'm about to leave
for the airport.

I'll take you.

Thanks, but I have a car coming.

Now, where is my passport?

Nigel, have you
seen my passport?

I don't live
here, Zoey,

I merely
pay the rent.

Look, I just don't want
to leave things between us

the way that they are.

Everything's fine.

No, it's not.

I said I love you,
and the only thing

I got in response is the not
very surprising information

that you don't want to die
in a crashing plane.

Can't we discuss this
when I get back?

What's there to discuss?

You either love me,
or you don't.

Walden, I'm about to leave
on an important business trip,

and the last thing I need
right now is more pressure.

I'm not pressuring you.

I'm just asking you for a
simple, definitive answer

right now before you leave.

What was that?

Sorry, just knocked over
your Chinese table lamp.

Perhaps you can
buy another one

next time you jet
to Francisco.

It came up.

I'm sorry, I just don't have
the time for this now, okay?

Ava, are you dressed?

That seems pretty
definitive to me.

That's it.

No more relationships.
I'm done.

Finished; just over.

Hi.

Hi.

And I'm back.

âª Men

Hey, can I have 75 bucks
for the new Call of Duty?

$75 for a video game?

Think of it as an investment.

An investment?

Yeah. If I go into the
army after high school,

I'll already know how
to kill terrorists.

Who had corn chowder
for dinner last night?

How do you know anybody
had corn chowder last night?

'Cause it's dripping
all over your bathroom.

Oh.

Sorry about that.

Uh, Lyndsey got a little bit...

queasy this morning.

Is she pregnant?

Oh, no, no, gosh, no.

Absolutely not.

Here.

Me?

Not my girlfriend,
not my vomit,

not my problem.

I'll clean it up.

You will?

For 75 bucks.

That's great.

Hey, everybody.

This is Jennifer.
Hi.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Well, let's go take
a walk on the beach.

Great.

Uh, Walden,
before you go,

can I talk to you
for a minute?

I'll bring him right back.

You'd better.

My name's Jake.

Hi, Jake.

My friends call me... Jake.

What are you doing?

Zoey made it perfectly clear.

She doesn't love me or need me.

So, I'm moving on.

You left here an hour ago.

How did you find
another girl already?

Oh, I met her in the elevator.

I've been in
a million elevators.

I never once walked out
with a girl like that.

Maybe you need to work
on your attitude.

What exactly did Zoey say?

No, it's what she didn't say.

She didn't say, "I love you."

Oh, please! If I insisted on
women saying "I love you""

I'd have never have had a
girlfriend, a wife or a mother.

Oh. It's Zoey.

Hello?

So, Jennifer,
how old are you?

24. How old are you?

I'm... 24-and-a-half.

Hmm.

Hmm?

I'm surprised
that you called.

Where are you?

On the plane.

We're sitting at the gate.

- Are you okay?
- No.

I feel miserable
about the way we left things.

- You do?
- Yeah.

I've just been so stressed
and busy lately

that I haven't been able
to think straight.

But sitting here
for the last 40 minutes

without so much
as a bloody glass of water,

I've come to a realization.

I'm listening.

The reason I haven't said...

those words to you

is because I'm afraid

that if I do say them,
something bad will happen.

Why would you think that?

'Cause it always has.

I've only said
those words twice.

The last time,
I ended up married

to an insufferable twit.

And the time before that?

I got a thank-you note

and a Swatch watch
from Russell Brand.

Russell Brand?

Mm, not my proudest moment.

Okay. I get it.

So, you're just superstitious
about saying it,

but it has nothing to do with
the way that you feel about me?

No. Not at all.

In fact, the whole reason
I called is

to tell you that I honestly
I...

Oh, there you are.

Ooh! Cool bedroom.

Who's that?

Uh... Berta.

You couldn't even wait
till my plane takes off?!

No, no, Zoey, it's not what you think!
Oh, good-bye, Walden.

Zoey, just...

âª Awkward!

Oh... I can't believe I kissed
the mouth that did this.

Alan, I need to
talk to you. Oh!

Can we do it out here?

Gladly.

Oh, good Lord!

Looks like someone
cleaned a deer in the bathtub.

What's going on?

Zoey FaceTimed me
from the plane

to tell me that she loves me.

Good.

But she saw Jennifer
in my bedroom.

Bad.

So, naturally, I immediately
tried to call her back.

Good.
But she wouldn't answer.

Bad.
So I'm gonna fuel up my jet,

and fly to London
and beg for forgiveness.

Good.
Will you stop that, Alan?

I-I need you to come with me.
Me? Why?

Because I might need a witness,
and you can say

that you saw that
nothing happened with Jennifer.

Great. I'm your man.

I am not gonna touch that glove.

Come on.

Oh, uh, wait.

I promised Lyndsey
I'd take her out

to a big, fancy,
romantic dinner tonight.

Bring her.
Really?

Yeah, sure.

Well, I guess a private jet

to London does beat

an 11-year-old Volvo
to the Olive Garden.

I'll-I'll pack a bag.

No, no, no, there's no time.

I'll buy you whatever you need
in London.

You're kidding.
Yeah. Come on.

Hey, if Zoey won't say it,
I will.

I love you, Walden Schmidt.

Thank you, Walden.

This is just incredible.

Glad you like it.
Mm.

What did your son say
when you told him

you were flying
to London tonight?

He told me to bring him back
some English pot.

This is definitely
the way to travel.

No boarding passes,
no airport security,

none of those scanners

that show strangers
the size of your dingle.

Don't you worry about
your dingle, honey.

He's a grower, not a shower.

Yeah, he told me.

He tells everyone.

Can I interest
you in a brewski?

What?

That's Polish for

"Do you want a beer?"

I've traveled
extensively through Asia.

Oh. Thanks.

Are you sure Walden said
he'd be right back?

Forget Walden.

Let's talk about us.

Us?

That's English
for you and me.

âª Poppin' bottles in the ice

âª Like a blizzard

âª When we drunk, we do it right,
gettin' slizzard âª

âª Like a G-6, like a G-6...

Uh, honey, honey,
why don't you take your seat

and put your seatbelt on?

Pish, pish, party pooper.

Wally, this is so romantic
what you're doing.

You are flying
across a whole ocean

just to win back
the woman you love.

Thank you.

Alan, sweetie,
I need to tell you something.

Yeah?

I know I give you a hard time,

but in my heart,

I really, really
love...

Oh, God!

Oh. Aah.

I'm so sorry.

Oh! Oh!

Oh. Oh.

So sorry.
Here. Here.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, God!

Oh!
Oh, my God!

Oh, hang on.
Oh, God!

I'll-I'll get...
I'll get some towels.

Okay, folks,

we've got clear skies ahead,

and we'll be in London
in approximately four hours.

So, just sit back and enjoy
the rest of your flight.

âª Men.

Bottom line, Zoey,
I can assure you

that nothing happened
between Walden and that woman.

Really?

What possible reason
would I have to lie to you?

Well, for one thing, he gave

you and Lyndsey a
free trip to London,

where you all
inexplicably decided

to dress up
like Japanese tourists.

That's my fault.

I kind of threw up
on them a little.

A little?
I might have to get a new plane.

Yes, yes, yes, that's
all very interesting,

but the fact remains

that you still invited
my neighbor Jennifer--

the whore
from the seventh floor--

back to your house.

Yeah, but nothing happened.

Nothing happened 'cause
I called and interrupted you!

Okay, I think we're saying
the same thing here.

Listen, the fact is, I love you.

Okay, and I was an idiot
to put pressure on you,

I made a terrible mistake,
and I'm very, very sorry.

Okay. Uh, we sh...

I think we should go.

I do love you, Walden.

You do?

Of course I do.

That's why I called you
from the plane, you ninny.

So...

you forgive me?

Well, that depends.

Do I have to worry every time
we have a fight

that you're going to go out
and pick up another woman?

Not as long
as I know that you love me.

Good answer.

Come here.

I love you, Lyndsey.

And I love you.

Oh, not in my mouth!

Oh, God.

Oh, dear.

No, seriously, dude. No lie.

All right, fine,
you don't believe me? Here.

Yup. Five times.
Best half hour of my life.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh, damn!

What password
did I use for this?

Um...

Uh, Jake.

Nope. Um...

Jake-1.

Jake-2.

Alan.

Alan-1.

Berta!

Ooh, maybe that's it!

Big Scary Lady.

Where is Berta?

She went home early.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

Anything I can do for you?

Out of dental floss.

Ooh. Uh, waxed?

Unwaxed? Cinnamon?

You carry a selection
of dental floss?

I am a soldier in the war
against gingivitis.

Got the gums of a 20-year-old.

I'll take the cinnamon.

Ooh, good choice.

Clean teeth and fresh breath.

Mm-hmm.

What are you doing?

I was trying to do
some on-line banking,

but I forgot my password.

I can help you with that.
Move over.

Oh, I forgot I had a computer
genius in the house.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, let's put in
your e-mail address.

And click on
"forgot password."

Hey, there's a password hint.

"What is my favorite state?"

Uh, California?

You are a hacker's nightmare.

Not California.

Huh.

Gosh, um, try Hawaii.

Nope.

The good news is we only
have 48 states to go.

Favorite state,
favorite state.

What's my favorite state?

I'm getting
a Skype call.

It's my ex-wife.

Hi, Walden.

Hi, Bridget.

Engorged!

My favorite state is
fully engorged!

Hello, Alan.

Hi, Bridget.

Um, that was
just my-my password.

You know what?
I'll just let you guys talk.

How do you explain him
to people?

I usually tell people that my
wife drove me to homosexuality.

What's up?

Billy called.

Billy Stanhope?

Yeah, he said he's has a
business proposition for you.

Really?

Why on Earth would I do
business with him

after what he did to me?

Hey, don't get upset with me.
I'm just the messenger.

I'm not upset. I've moved on.

It, uh, it's behind me.

Yeah, I recognize your
"I'm not upset" eye twitch.

My eye is not twitching.

You know, tell him thank you,
but no, thank you.

Got it.

I wish him well, but I pass.

Fine.

I'm flattered, but no can do.

Understood.

And if my eye is twitching,

it's only because I have
conjunctivitis.

You don't have conjunctivitis,
Walden.

We're not married anymore,
Bridget.

You have no idea
what kind of diseases I have.

Good-bye.

How about that.

Billy Stanhope.

Whoa!

Everything okay?

Yeah. Why?

Uh... the blood-curdling scream?

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

No, no, I often react that way
after chatting with my ex-wife.

This isn't about my ex-wife.

It's about my ex-friend
Billy Stanhope.

Oh, I've never
heard you mention him before.

Have you ever heard me mention
rectal cancer?

No.

Same principle.

What went down between you two?

Well, we built

a software company in
Bridget's garage,

and then sold it for
a couple billion dollars.

That son of a bitch.

No wonder you hate him.

I don't think you understand.

He didn't want to sell,
so when we did, he went crazy.

Really?

Yeah, oh, yeah.

Here, look, he put it on YouTube

for the whole world to see.

Hello, world.

It's me, Billy Stanhope,

and I'm here to drop another
smart bomb of truth!

This is my ex-partner
Walden Schmidt.

Oh, isn't he pretty?

Hey, Walden, tell everyone
how pretty you are.

I'm pretty!

Yes, you are.
You are pretty.

But that's just on
the outside.

On the inside,
you are a soul-sucking,

money-grubbing sellout!

Oh, don't forget giant douche.

I'm also a giant douche!

Thanks, buddy.

I'm always forgetting about your
extreme doucheyness!

You know what
I'm gonna do, Walden?

I... I'm gonna eat you, yeah.

I'm gonna eat you
and chew you up,

and digest you and then
go in the bathroom

and take a big steaming Schmidt!

Whoa.

You think that's bad.

Watch this one.

Hey, folks!
Walden Schmidt here.

I just wanted you to see me
as I really am.

So he's actually talking out
of his ass?

He calls it "buttriloquism"

That's-That's very disturbing.

Yeah.

That's the least disturbing

of the ass-talking videos.

It-It's crazy.

I made this guy, like,
a billion dollars,

and then he turns on me.

And then he accuses me
of being a sellout.

Talk about ingratitude.

If you made me rich,

the only thing
I'd accuse you of

is being the best... guy ever.

Thanks.

Seriously.
If you don't believe it,

throw me a couple of mil
and get ready for a tongue bath.

I doubt that will be necessary.

I am not talking just
metaphorically.

I will lick you
from head to toe.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Surprise.

You gotta be kidding me.

Walden...

Walden, come on!

Hey, who's at the door?

Rectal cancer!

Hi.

Hi.

I'm Billy Stanhope.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
I recognize you from the video.

You look good.

Well, you know, I cut out sugar
and took up yoga,

stopped smoking crack.

Well, whatever it is you're
doing, it's working.

Who are you?

Oh, yeah, I'm Walden's friend...

confidante, mentor, gatekeeper.

Oh, yeah, Bridget told
me about you.

Yeah, the leech.

Alan Harper.
Pleased to meet you.

Hey. Listen, gatekeeper,
any way I could talk

to Walden for just
five minutes?

Oh, I don't think so.
He's pretty peeved.

I got this billion-dollar idea

that can't move forward
without him.

But, look, if he won't see me,
he won't see me, so...

Hold up, Billy.

Come on in. Come on in.

Uh, talk to me.

So, uh, a billion
dollars, you say?

At least.
Wow.

What could possibly be worth
a billion dollars?

It's simple, really.

I mean, are you familiar with

Web-based aggregate upstream
power grid manipulation?

Uh... I-I have Netflix.

Okay, look, it's not important.

If you could just...

I just need to talk
to him for five minutes.

I don't think
that's gonna happen.

All right. Here's $50.00.

Wait right here.
Okay.

Yeah?

Got a second?

Yeah, come in.

Whatcha doin'?

Playing a racing game.

Ah, that's fun.

Uh, after my divorce, I played
"World of Warcraft" for a while,

hoping to meet girls.

Did you meet any?

Well, let's just say, if you're

lonely enough and drunk enough,
everybody's a girl.

So, listen, um, I was having

a very interesting conversation
with your former compadre.

You let that son of a bitch
in my house?

Uh, well, yeah,
I-I was just...

You let him
in my house?!

Well, I didn't
see any harm.

I kinda felt sorry
for the guy.

I thought I could
trust you, Alan!

You can! I just got
sucked in by the words

"billion dollar idea."

What idea?

Uh, something about, uh,

upstream grid perambulation?

What?

Uh, in-in-incubation...
ma... ma-masturbation...

I don't know!

Was it Web-based aggregated

upstream power grid
manipulation?

Yes, that's it.

Oh, my God...

He figured out
The Electric Suitcase.

Is it really worth
a billion dollars?

Oh, yeah.

Probably should've
held out for more than 50.

All right,
let's hear it.

Oh, you look good
without the beard.

And you look good
without the crack pipe.

Okay, just...

You really think

we can finally build
The Electric Suitcase?

Yes.
We have the technology now.

I-I just need you
to help me write the code.

Really?

You need my help?

'Cause I-I thought I was
just a pretty face,

and you were the brains
behind the operation.

Okay, we both know that
was Class-A narcotics

and psychotic jealousy
joining forces to...

to tell the truth.

Okay.

Say you're sorry and...
we'll get to work.

I'm here, isn't that enough?

Nope. Get out.
Okay.

Wait, what-whatever.

Fine.

I'm...

Oh, wait.

Wald, come on, man.

Okay. Go.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry to who?

I'm sorry
to Walden Schmidt.

For?

For calling him names.

And?

Frivolously suing him
for $100 million.

Okay.

Now cross your eyes,
stick out your tongue,

and dance like a monkey.

I will rip your throat out!

Bring it on,
Poppin' Fresh!

I will do it!
Fellas! Fellas!

I will do it!

Oh, wait!

Hey, hey, hey!

I'm getting too old
for this crap.

âª Men. âª

Now, come on, shake hands.

I don't wanna.

Okay.

Walden, you want to be
the bigger man?

I am the bigger man.

Oh, that's-- yeah,
with the short jokes, okay.

No, you are a short joke.

"You are a short joke."

Walden, that's not helping.

Now, come on, guys,
this is silly!

Now, you've got
a billion-dollar idea

waiting for us.

Us?
Us?

Okay, you.

Bring it in.

See, see?
Was that so hard?

Guess not.

Remember the fight we had

over what to name
our first piece of software?

Yeah.

You wanted to call it
MusicAlgorithm.com.

Yeah, because
that's what it was.

What it was was boring.

Yeah, it was a lot better
than SongSnatch.

Whoa, hey!

SongSnatch is catchy.

Oh, yeah, so is herpes!

Why didn't we call it
Herpes.com?!

Because it was taken!

Guys, guys,
let's-let's bring it back, okay?

Easy does it, guys.

Right.

Sorry.

So what did you
end up calling it?

Blungogo.

How'd you come up with that?

It was the sound
that Billy was making

when I was trying
to choke him to death.

Blungogo!

I heard that,
I knew that was the name.

Yeah. Way to go, partner.

Hey, if you hadn't been
trying to kill me,

it never would've
come out of my mouth.

You really think
we can build this thing?

If anybody can do it, it's us.

All right, where would we start?

Well, first thing, we'd go over

the original design
for the code,

split it up into little chunks
that can be handled

by multiple parallel processors.

Sounds good.

Yeah, that's what
I would do, yeah.

Mm-hmm.

Then we can start
compiling the modules,

testing them, see if we can
get them to talk to each other.

Yeah, exactly.

No brainer.

Maybe the way to start is
I'll set up the testing sandbox,

and you set up the I/O module,

and then we'll just
go from there.

Good.

What do I do?

What can you do?

Uh...

I-I can make cookies.

You like cookies?

Anyway, it's a multi-
billion-dollar idea

that doesn't
have a prayer

unless I get these
two guys together.

And how do they thank me?

They eat my cookies
and send me to 7-Eleven

for Red Bull and Hot Pockets.

Aw.
I got to tell you,

my feelings are
a little bit hurt.

I mean, I thought Walden and I

were, like, best friends,
but it turns out,

this Billy guy
is really his best friend.

Well, old friends
are hard to compete with.

Yeah.

The sad thing is I don't really
have any old friends.

What about the people
you went to school with?

My social life at school
was mostly running and hiding.

Summer camp?

Oh, I still get Christmas cards

from this one counselor
who's in prison.

Prison?

Pedophile.

Ew.

So, what happened
to your girlfriend?

Oh, she's on vacation.

Oh, where'd she go?

Wouldn't say.

It's kind of a vacation from me.

So what you're saying is there's
absolutely no one in your life

who you consider a close friend?

I don't count.

Well, there is one person
I have a lot of history with.

Hey, pal, what's up?

âª Men. âª

Hey, don't forget to declare
the routine global.

Yeah, do I look like
my e-mail address is at AOL.com?

Man, I've had to pee
for, like, an hour.

I've had to pee for two hours.

If you really have to go,

there's a bathroom
down the hallway.

Oh, hey, I can hold it.

If you have to use it though,
go right ahead.

Oh, no, I can hold it.

All right, fine.

You really are a competitive
son of a bitch, aren't you?

Hey, don't rag on me just 'cause
you have a girlie bladder.

We'll see who's got
the girlie bladder.

Oh, okay.
Well, all right.

I don't have to cross my legs.

I don't have to cross
my legs, either.

You know what,
I think I'm going to

print this routine as a backup.

Control... P.

That's a good idea.

I think I'm gonna print up
all of my routines.

P-P-P...

P-P...
P...

P-P!
P...

âª Men. âª

Soup?

Why'd you bring me soup?

'Cause you're sick.

Oh, right.

Thank you.

And let's face it,

friends should take care
of each other.

We're friends?

Oh, come on, Berta.

How many years
have we known each other?

That-That's got to count
for something.

You have been in my life
longer than both my husbands

and most of my underwear.

Come here, friend.

Now we're hugging friends.

Those hands start to wander,
this friendship is over.

Excuse me.

You know, that's-that's
what I love about you.

You know, the salty
sense of humor,

poking fun at me.

That's the glue
that binds us together.

Right.

Gracias.

Adios.

What was that?

It's Mexican Halloween.

So, listen, friend, I wonder
if you'd do me a little favor.

Uh, sure, name it.

I need you to go
to this address,

ask for Shermie
and give him this envelope.

Oh, happy to.

No one else, only Shermie.

Okay.

Who's Shermie?

Just a guy I owe some money to.

So this is the money.

Most of it.

Ow! Oh! Okay...

Okay.

Sometimes peeing's
better than sex.

Absolutely.

Although, when I was
smoking crack,

a lot of times peeing and sex
were the same thing.

Hey, uh, while we're
on the subject...

What, peeing?

No, sex.

Something you should know.

About sex?

I think I'm okay.

Yeah, we've all seen
the python.

What can I tell you,
it's factory equipment.

Right, great, no.

It's about your ex-wife.

What, Bridget?

Yeah, I'm, uh...
kinda sleeping with her.

What?!

Hey, watch where
you're pointing that thing!

When did this start?

Well, you know I always had
a thing for her.

And when you guys broke up,
I took her out, you know,

gave her a shoulder to cry on,

and she just kind of
worked her way down.

So when she called me
about you...?

I was there.

Oh, man.

Hey, I wasn't listening.

Her thighs were
covering my ears.

Oh, you son
of a bitch!

Hey! Okay, okay!

Hey, hey, hey!

Hey!
Don't! Don't!

I swear to God, Shermie!

That's all she gave me!

Oh, crap, oh, crap,
oh, crap, oh, crap.

Ah.

Oh, crap, oh, crap.

âª Men. âª

You still mad
about me and Bridget?

I hate your guts.

Good, that's what
I was going for.

Hey.

What... what happened
to your pants?

Uh, I had a little accident.

Um...

Why are you wearing robes?

Uh, we had
a little accident, too.

H-H-How are you guys doing?

Oh, hey, we're good, man.

We're about to, uh,
about to test the first module.

Walden, would you do the honors?

Oh, no, please.

No, it was your vision.

Yeah, but it was your expertise.

Yeah, but I'm banging
your ex-wife.

All the while wondering
if she misses the python.

Press the damn button.

Fine.

Behold the birth

of The Stanhope-Schmidt
Electric Suitcase.

Yes!
Yes!

That's it?

I mean,
I have an iPhone app

that'll turn out
the house lights.

No, no, no, no.
It's much more than that.

Name a state.

Engorged.

Oh, okay.

Uh, Florida.

Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, guys,

I just don't get it.

I'm going to bed.

Oh, try Canada.

Lights "oot."

Okay, now... the master switch.

Awesome!

.......... ********** ..........

I miss you, too,
but what are you doing up?

Isn't it, like, 3:00
in the morning in London?

Yeah, I've been having trouble
sleeping, too.

Alan suggested warm milk
and masturbation,

but that's his answer
for pretty much everything.

No, don't worry.

He's not gonna live here
forever.

More importantly, uh,
when are you coming back?

Ugh! Really, another week?

All right, that settles it.

I'm gonna heat up some milk.

Okay, all right.

Try to get some sleep.

I love you.

No, I love you more.

No, uh-uh, I love you more.

(makes kissing
sounds)

(Jake laughs)

(making
kissing sounds)

You got a problem with love?

Uh-uh.
No, no.

Sorry.

Oh, it's Jake and his friend.

No, he's not gonna stay here
forever, either.

All right, bye-bye.
Sweet dreams.

Sorry, we'll get out
of your way.

Nah, that's okay.

What are you guys doing?

Well, we were gonna
play a video game

on the big screen,
but if you're busy...

No, no, come on.

Nice.
Awesome.

Where's your dad?

Oh, he's out with
this guy's mom.

Yeah, they're picking
my grandma up

at the International House
of Old People.

I-Hoop.

She's in a rest home?

I guess
they're resting.

They don't move
very much.

Oh, except on pudding day.

Uh, then you could
get trampled.

Wow. Your dad's meeting
his girlfriend's mother.

That's a big step.

What's bigger than
boning each other?

Shut up!

Come on. We both
know they're doing it.

- We've heard them.
- Dude!

Oh, Alan!
Oh, Lyndsey!

Okay, quit it,
or I'm leaving.

Okay, fine.

And I'm taking my game.

I apologize.
Accepted.

It's nice you guys have a sense
of humor about that stuff.

So many kids of divorce are,
like, so angry all the time.

Yeah, well, it's kind of
hard to stay angry

when you smoke
as much pot as we do.

Truth.

When my dad left, I was, like,
really angry.

What did you do?

Just channeled my energy

into learning how
to program computers.

Made my first million
by the time I was 20.

- Oh, that's our plan, too.
- Totally.

Really? What language
do you guys code in?

Java? Perl? C-Plus-Plus?

Um...

Okay, maybe not a million.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah.
âª Men.

(humming)

You're in a good mood.

I am.

Looking forward to
seeing your mother?

Not at all.

I'm high as a kite.

If I'm looking forward
to anything,

it's for that second
muscle relaxer to kick in.

I hear you. Unfortunately,
I can't do that with my mom.

I have to stay alert.

Dinner with her is like being
trapped in a box with a snake.

(laughs)
My mom's more like a hamster.

They seem cuddly,
but they eat their young.

Can't wait to meet her.

Oh, you'll love her.

Everybody loves her.

She's sweet, shy and charming.

Unless you happened
to come out of her uterus,

then you're part
of a balanced breakfast.

That bad, huh?

Yeah, and it's gotten worse
since my dad died.

Oh, she must have loved him
very much.

Nah, hated his guts.

She tried to kill him once.

You're kidding.

Yeah, they were playing golf.

He gave her a swing tip.

She hit him on the head
with a pitching wedge.

A-a pitching wedge?

It was the right club.

They were about 90 yards out.

Anyway, when he finally died
years later,

she decided
he was the love of her life,

moved into
a retirement community,

and put a "gone fishing sign"
on her hoo-ha.

Okay, guess I shouldn't
mention golf during dinner.

Mm.

Or fishing.

Yeah. You might also want
to stay away from politics,

religion or The Price Is Right.

The Price Is Right?

She misses Bob Barker.

Hates Drew Carey.

Oh, really?

I think he's a wonderful breath
of fresh air.

Do not say that.

âª Men.

See, he's right
behind you!

Ah!
He's right behind you!

Move! Move! Duck!

Ah, ah, don't worry, Junior.
I got this!

Aah, crap.

Watch and learn.

Man, I used to be a lot better
at this.

I guess
I'm just out of practice.

That's 'cause
you got a girlfriend now.

Yeah. Your thumbs
have gotten weak.

That's why
I choose to be a bachelor.

Yeah, that's why.

So, what's the deal
with you and Zoey?

Are you gonna marry her?

I don't know.
I mean, I love her and all,

but I just got out
of a marriage.

Do I really want
to be back in one?

Hell, yeah.
She's hot.

It's not about how hot she is.

Oh, thank you, Jake.

It's about whether
she stays hot.

I mean, plus, there's some
serious stuff to consider.

She has a daughter,
so I'd be a stepdad.

My stepdad's a pretty cool guy.

I mean, he's always
slipping me money.

I think he feels bad
about replacing my dad.

Or about banging
your mom.

Shut up!

Mm, doesn't feel
so good, does it?

That's what
your mom said.

All right, can we please talk
about something other than sex?

Yes.
Okay.

But for the record,
I'm not a virgin.

Good to know.

Neither am I.

At least I think I'm not.

It was dark.

Could have been just leg.

But that still counts.

No, it doesn't.

Right?

Listen, if he thinks
he got laid,

what difference does it make?

Thank you.

âª Men.

Mom, this is Alan.

Alan, this is my mom Jean.

Hi. Nice to
meet you.

How are you?

Uh, good, good.

Although I-I got to admit,
I'm-I'm a little nervous.

You know, I hope Mom likes me,
you know?

Relax, Alan.

When it comes to men,

Lyndsey has never
set the bar very high.

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm just saying that
you've always gone

for quantity
over quality.

It's a choice.
I'm not judging.

(sighs)
Oh.

Come on, muscle relaxers.

So, Alan,
do you have children?

Uh, I do. I have a son.
Mm.

That's good,

'cause even if Lyndsey
could bear another child,

I'm not sure
that would be the smartest move.

Mom!

Tell the truth.

Do you want another one
like Eldridge?

Let's just change
the subject.

Does anybody want
another Eldridge?

How are things
at Sunset Village?

Same old, same old.

Well, actually, some
of the same old died,

so we got some new old.

Oh, th's awful.

Not really.

If you get to their condo
before the relatives,

you can score
some great stuff.

Oh, Mom,
you're not saying...

How do you think
I got this lovely sweater?

It certainly wasn't
a Mother's Day gift.

(scoffs)

(laughs)
Well, uh,

if it comes up,
I'm a 40 regular.

(laughs)

So, Mom, do you want to do
anything special this weekend?

I'll be happy doing
whatever you want.

Oh, well, I-I thought maybe
tomorrow we could have lunch

at the Santa Monica Pier,
then go for a walk on the beach.

Oh, okay.

We don't have to.

No, that's fine.

I'm not afraid of
homeless people.

You know, your
daughter's a good lady.

You did a great
job with her, Jean.

Thanks.

But it was touch and go
for a while.

She told you about her
show business career, right?

Seriously, Mom? Really?

What? It was a
very nice movie--

if you like pornography.

Okay, I-I saw it, and-and
it wasn't pornography.

Well, it wasn't Mary Poppins.

So,

you guys graduate this year,
right?

I do.

I do, too.

Well, that's what
you said last year.

Yeah, but now, they're one
more year sicker of me.

So what are you gonna do now?

Well, we were hoping
we could work for you.

Doing what?

We'd be, like, consultants.

And what would you
be consulting about?

Well, that would be
our first consultation.

How about this?

We could tell you
what kids these days are into

and then develop killer apps
to target that geographic.

Demographic.

No, Republican kids, too.

Mm.

All right, Consultants,

tell me some of your app ideas.

Okay, well, you know, uh,

when you take a picture of
your junk and send it to a girl?

Um... no.

But I understand the concept.

Okay, okay, well, this app
makes your junk look bigger.

And you can customize it.

You can customize your junk?

Yeah, you know,
like silly hats,

glasses, little messages.

"Wish you were here."

Get it? Get it?

Yeah, I get it.

So, it's like Photoshop,
but for your junk.

We call it Junkshop.

It's a good name.

What do you do
if you already got big junk?

Oh, way ahead of you.
Tell him about Boobshop.

All right, you know
how girls always complain

about one boob being bigger
than the other?

Oh, thank God,
she's asleep.

I don't think
I can last four days.

Every word out of her mouth
pushes my buttons.

Yeah, I saw.
She's like a ninja mom.

She sneaks in,
destroys your will to live,

and then,
disappears without a trace.

So I'm not crazy?

Oh, no, not at all.
Oh.

In fact, it kind of makes me
grateful for my mom.

What do you mean?

Well, there's no sneaking

and stabbing in the back.

She just walks right up to you,

and hits you in the face
with a lead pipe.

(laughs)

I wonder what would happen

if we put them
in the same room together.

Uh. Momageddon.

(laughing)

Although... it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world.

What?!

Well, think about it.

They're around the same age,
they're single,

they're both deeply disappointed
in their children

and their children's children.

They might hit it off.

And if they did,
it might give us a break.

You know what? Tell you what--

I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

Oh, Alan,

that would
be wonderful. Mm.

I owe you one.

You still owe me one
from my birthday.

(sighs) Well...

if she wasn't here,
I'd be steering this car

with the back
of my head right now.

Looks like she's
sleeping pretty good.

Oh, what the hell?
Scoot your seat back.

ALAN:
Yay!

âª Men.

Hey, what you doing?

Absolutely nothing.

I'm bored out of my mind.

Oh, well, Lyndsey and I
are having dinner with our moms.

You're welcome to join us.

A two-mom dinner?

You can say no.

No. God, no.

I get you.

I don't want to go, either.

Why are you
doing it?

Are you thinking
about getting married?

Um, to answer your questions
in reverse order:

not at the moment and oral sex.

Night.

Oral sex.

Time to warm up the old milk.

Oh, great, Amy.

We'll be there.

What's going on?

Just got invited

to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

Cool.

Can we borrow your car?

Uh, all right, let me think.

Two potheads want to borrow
my $100,000 car

to go to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

Sounds like a no.

Wait, wait, wait.

Let's hear him out.

It's a no!

I'll give you guys a ride.

- Oh, sweet.
- Thanks.

What you got going on
with the water?

Oh, we had another idea
for an app.

Let me guess-- Sinkshop.

Oh, no, no.

Okay, imagine the app
is on my phone.

- All right.
- Go ahead.

(inhales deeply)

JAKE:
Now, all I do

is press this button,
and our app will tell you

exactly how long you can
hold your breath underwater.

That's clever.

Thanks.

How is it different
than the stopwatch

that's already
on your phone?

The what?

See this
little clock?

Oh.

Damn.

How long?

So this is nice, huh?

Lovely.

I can't remember
how long it's been

since the last time
you called me to have dinner.

Oh, come on. It hasn't
been that long.

Oh, please.
Jake was still cute.

Guess it has been awhile.

So what's up with this dinner?

Why are you finally allowing me
to meet your girlfriend?

First of all, I wasn't
disallowing you

from meeting her;
I was just, uh...

avoiding it as long as possible.

Uh, but things
are more serious between us now,

and I thought it might be nice

for you two
to get to know each other.

- All right.
- And her mother might come along.

Her mother?

Yeah, she's, uh,
in town visiting.

I thought you two
might hit it off.

Alan, you know
I don't like old people.

I do know, but you'll like her.

She's young at heart,
like you.

I'm young everywhere--
all the parts.

Sure.

What I haven't replaced,

I've had tightened,
bleached or trimmed.

Got it.

So where's
the old biddy live?

Palmdale.

Palmdale, ech.

Is she married?

Uh, widow.

How'd her husband die?

Heart attack.

Boring.

She did actually try
to kill him once.

Oh.

Well, at least we have
something in common.

Sure you gave me
the right address?

Yeah.

1478 Amy Lane.

Wait a sec.

Isn't Amy Lane the name
of the chick having the party?

It may not be Amy Lane.

But we're on
Amy Lane.

An amazing coincidence, huh?

Is there somebody
you guys can call?

I mean,
I can call Amy Lane.

If that is, in fact,
her real name.

(thud)

Evelyn, Alan tells me
you do a lot of traveling.

Yes. I love it.

The classical architecture,
the exotic cuisine,

the uncircumcised men.

(gags)

Although one could make a case

that falls under
"exotic cuisine."

(whispering): Just like you and
Alan in the car.

Do you guys travel much?

Not anymore.

But when my husband was alive,
we went everywhere.

Six Flags, Epcot, Dollywood.

Charming.

Real globe-trotter.
(chuckles)

Speaking of which, I once slept
with Meadowlark Lemon.

Let me tell you,

basketballs weren't
the only thing he could spin.

(whispering):
I'm so sorry.

I hope this is it.

They have a balloon
on the mailbox

that says party.
Mm.

(doorbell rings)

Yeah?

Uh, is this
where the party is?

Oh, you saw the balloon, huh?

Come on in.

Okay.
Oh, hang on.

Hang on. Excuse us.

Don't you pay attention
in health class?

What are you
talking about?

Stranger danger.

No, he seems okay.

You guys like to wrestle?

Let's book it, dude.

Yeah. Walden!
Don't go!

Always a bridesmaid.

Really, Alan?

Why don't I get this?

Well, you got to admit
my plan worked.

They hit it off and left us
pretty much unscathed.

Plus, thanks to your mom,
my mom can now go back

to her retirement community
and show all her girlfriends

what happens
when you Google "Santorum."

(both laughing)

Lyndsey, will you take me
to get a tramp stamp?

What?

It's a cute little tattoo
right here.

Evelyn has one.

You do?

I got it in Singapore.

The Chinese characters for:
"Thank you. Come again."

All right, well,
we're done here.

Why don't we head home?

I don't want
to go home.

Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

where they have music
and dancing.

Oh, I don't think so.
It's getting kind of late.

Yeah, we both have
to work in the morning.

I don't.

Neither do I.

Why don't you two fuddy-duddies
run along

and let Jean and I
have some fun?

How will you get home?

Alan, I made it from Brunei
to Morocco with nothing

but the clothes on my back
and a tube of lubricant.

I think I can get us
from Tarzana to Sherman Oaks.

(giggling):
Isn't she a hoot?

All right,
if you're sure.

Let's go.

You think we'll find
some cute fellas to dance with?

Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean.

We're not going
to dance.

âª Men.

Should have written
the address down, dude.

I did write it down.

She must have told it
to me wrong.

Or maybe you
heard it wrong.

If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

(button clicks)

(on phone): If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

Don't mock us, man.

(button clicks)

Don't mock us, man.

Hi, Jake.

Hi, Eldridge.

- Hey.
- Hi.

I bet they were
at the party.

Yeah, maybe they can
tell us where it is.

Oh, good thinking.

I'll text 'em.

Wait, I don't have
their numbers.

Man, we're never going
to find this party.

Okay.

Let me ask you a question.

If you had made it to the party,
what would you have done there?

Try to hook up
with some chicks.

Why don't you hook up with them?

Right there--
that's why you're rich.

Would you mind very much if
we, you know, blew you off?

I would worry about
you if you didn't.

- Bye.
- Later.

ELDRIDGE:
Hello, ladies.

JAKE: Mind if we
hook up with you?

âª Men.

Morning.
Morning.

Oh, morning.

You and Evelyn have a
good time last night?

Fantastic.
Mm.

I adore your mother.

(chuckling): That's only because
you just met her.

I don't know, I think I got
to know her pretty well.

Good morning,
darling.

Hi, Peaches.

Once again,
I'm so, so sorry.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

Billy called.

Billy Stanhope?

Yeah, he said he has
a business proposition for you.

How 'bout that?

Billy Stanhope...

What went down between you two?

Well, we built Eddie's software
company in Bridget's garage

and then sold it
for a couple billion dollars.

That son of a bitch.

He didn't want to sell.

You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

Yes, we have the technology now.

I-I just need you to help me
write the code.

Hey, you know, while
we're on the subject...

What? Peeing?
No, sex.

There's something
you should know.

It's about your ex-wife.

What? Bridget?

Yeah, I'm, uh...

kind of sleeping with her.

What?!
W-Wait, hey...

Mom, this is Alan.

Alan, this is
my mom, Jean.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

You know what?
Tell you what.

I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

where they have
music and dancing.

Why don't you two
fuddy-duddies run along

and let Jean and I
have some fun.

You think we'll find some
cute fellas to dance with?

Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean...

we're not going to dance.

I adore your mother.

That's only because
you just met her.

I don't know.

I think I got
to know her pretty well.

Good morning, darling.

Hi, Peaches.

âª Men...âª

Great. I'll pick you up
at the airport.

I can't wait.

I love you, too.

Tell Zoey I said "hi."

Oh, Alan says "hi."

Yes, he's still here.

Uh-huh. I know. You're right.

She says "hi" back.

Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

Here you go.

Oh, thank you.

You got to be excited about
having your girlfriend back.

What has it been, a month?
Three weeks.

Still, that's like
a decade in penis years.

Yeah.

Tell you the truth, I'm actually
a little bit worried.

About your relationship?

Come on. Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

At least for guys like you.

For guys like me,
absence is more often enforced

by the state of California.

Zoey doesn't know that I started
a new software company

with my old partner.

Yeah, with Billy, I know.
What's the big deal?

Well, there's
a third partner...

that Zoey's
not gonna like.

Walden...

you made me a partner?

All I did was bring
you two guys together,

The third partner is Bridget.

Your ex-wife?

Come on, I brought
you two guys together!

But she helped me design
the original code

for the software;
I had to bring her in.

Oh, right, right.

Well, I guess that would make
a very awkward conversation

with Zoey.

Yeah. I think I'm just gonna try

to slip it in
without her noticing.

Hmm. Story of my life.

Well, listen, just remember,

that love will get you
through times of no money

better than money will get you
through times of no love.

That's good advice.

Thank you.

And, uh, just to be clear...

uh, I have zero stake

in this potential
billion-dollar business?

Well, actually, I
was gonna give you

a hundred shares
of founders' stock.

Wow.

If this thing works,
it could be worth millions.

Thank you.

My problem is I still
got to figure out

how to explain this to Zoey.

Dump the bitch. Don't let her
screw this up for us.

Once again, thank you
for the advice.

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

I've got my own little
relationship problem brewing.

Yeah, that doesn't
make me feel better.

My girlfriend's mom and my mom

have become lovers.

Okay, that does
make me feel better.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men, men, manly men, men, men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Men, men, men, manly men âª
âª Ooh âª

âª Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... âª

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ooh âª
âª Men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

âª Men... âª

Can I ask you a question?
What?

If we just had sex in England,

would I be lying on
the other side of the bed?

Oh, God, I've missed you.

I missed you, too.

And you can call me Walden.

So, what have
you been up to?

Actually, I've been,
like, very, very busy.

With what?

I started a new
software company

with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

Walden!

Yeah.
That's terrific!

It's amazing and, and

we built this
amazing product.

It's called
the electric suitcase.

I-It's gonna completely
revolutionize

the global energy market.

Whoa. Sounds big.

No, it's bigger than big.
I mean, the three of us

could end up splitting
billions of dollars.

The three of you?

What?

You just said
the three of you.

Y-Yes, there are
in fact three of us.

Who's the third?

Oh, not Alan.

No, God, no.

So, who is it?

It's Bridget.

Your ex-wife?

There's nothing I could do.

I mean, she helped write the
original code for the software

so she still owns
a third of it.

So you've gone into
business with a woman

who drove her car
into your living room

because you chose me
over her?

Crazy world, huh?

On the plus side...

s-she's sleeping with
my ex-partner. So...

Why is that a plus side?

B-Because she's with him,

so you don't have to worry
about me and... her.

I wasn't worried
about you and her.

Good.

Until just now.

Why didn't you tell me
about this before we had sex?

Do you want to have sex now?

No!
That's why!

I'm going home.

Oh, come on, Zoey.

Don't make a big deal
out of this.

If I told you I was going into
business with my ex-husband

would you consider it
a big deal?

No, not at all.

You're a liar.

Life would be so much easier
if I dated dumb chicks.

I heard that.

It was a compliment.

Here you go.

Thank you. So..

have you given any thought
as to what we're gonna do

about our little...
mother situation?

Golden Girls Gone Wild?

Hey... what can we do?
They're grown woman.

They've made
a lifestyle choice.

I have no problem
with the lifestyle.

I've tried the lifestyle.

Really?! When?

Who? College? Camp?

Shut up, Alan.

Sorry. Go ahead.

How am I supposed to have
a relationship with you

when your mother is clearly
taking sexual advantage of mine?

H-Hang on a second.

I don't think anyone is
taking advantage of anyone.

You don't?

A week ago my mother was living
in a retirement community

playing golf
with her girlfriends

and watching reruns
of Cagney & Lacey.

Well, I don't know.

Golf, Cagney & Lacey...

Sounds like she was
already halfway there.

Shut up, Alan.

Oh, good, you're here.

Mom!

What have you done
to yourself?

Evelyn took me shopping.

Do you like my new look?

Isn't she gorgeous?

Yeah, I-I guess.

We also got matching tattoos.

Oh, Mom, no.

See? It's
a little heart.

Uh, with an
"E plus J" in it.

I don't see one
on your ankle, Mom.

It's not on my ankle.

Oh, glory-oski.

Mom, you've been gone all day.

I thought you and I were gonna
spend some time together

before you went back
to Sunset Village.

I know.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

We've been so busy.

But don't worry.

You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me

after I move in with Evy.

What?

I've got this huge place.

Why shouldn't she enjoy it?

You're talking about
your huge house, right?

We're just gonna pick up
some things here

and then go close up
Jean's condo.

And then we'll start
our new life,

right, Peaches?
That's right, Pumpkin.

Come on.

This sort of makes you
brother and sister, doesn't it?

Is it just me or is...
that idea kind of a turn-on?

It's just me.

âª Men...âª

Oh, come on.
It's not that weird.

Yeah, because we have
a child together.

Okay, well, Bridget and I
have a business together.

It's basically the same thing.

Have you been sniffing glue?

No! They both require
nurturing and attention.

The only difference is your
kid's gonna cost you a fortune

and mine is gonna
make a fortune.

Wow. Good-bye.

Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

J-Just...

do one thing for me.
What?

Let's the three of us
have dinner together.

You want me to have dinner
with you and your ex-wife?

Yes.

That way you can see that
everything is cool between us.

Come on, Zoey.
This is really important to me.

God, I'm gonna regret this.

One dinner.

Thank you.

I will see you tomorrow.

Good-bye.

Well done, old boy.

You dodged the crazy
girlfriend bullet.

Walden, I'm still
outside the door.

You didn't let me finish.

All right, finish.

I love you so much.

âª Men...âª

Here you go.

Thank you.

So did you tell Zoey
about working with Bridget?

Uh, yeah.

How'd it go?

Not good.

But she did agree
to have dinner with us.

W-Wait, you're having dinner

with your girlfriend
and your ex-wife?

Bad idea?

Well, not as bad as me trying
to turn my girlfriend on

with a little incest fantasy,
but it's right up there.

What else was I gonna do?
Well, I...

I'm not gonna dump the bitch.
Okay.

Fine, fine. We'll just keep
our eyes on the prize here.

What, your hundred shares
in the company?

I was more thinking
about your happiness,

but sure, there's that.

Hey, uh, this might
make you feel better.

Uh, I'm having my own
bad idea dinner.

What's that?

Lyndsey, her son, my son,
and the two gay grandmas.

Once again,
that does make me feel better.

Hey, how about this?

Why don't we meet back here

after our respective dinners
and compare notes?

Sort of like a recap at the end
of a reality show.

Yeah. Yeah, we could, uh,
you know, have a little contest.

See whose dinner was worse.

Shame we can't let
America vote on it.

Yeah.

Or can we?

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hey, this is really nice, huh?

Zoey, uh...

Bridget and I

were talking about your...

...your concerns, and

Bridget was very eager
to assuage them.

Right, Bridge?

Absolutely.

Okay.

Let the assuaging begin.

Anybody?

I'll take a
crack at it.

No, thank you, Berta.

All right, obviously,
this is an awkward situation.

Walden and I were

together for many, many years,

and you and he have been dating
for a few months now,

so clearly, you're insecure
about us working together.

I am not insecure.

Right, and there's no reason

you should be. Yes,

I've known this guy
since high school,

and yes, we fell in love,

and yes, we spent
many happy years together,

but the reality now is,
we're simply business partners.

Right.

And not all those years
were happy.

Oh, sure, there were
some great times.

Also, I want to build...

But there were also
some bad times.

Also some bad times.

I mean, the point is,

is that our relationship now
is just strictly business.

Oh, speaking of which, we need
to upgrade the ventilation

for the server farm.

Oh, that's a good idea.

Oh, also, I want to build
triple redundancy.

Of course, but we shouldn't be
talking shop

and leaving poor Zoey
out of the conversation.

No, that's all right. I love
to hear about Walden's work.

Oh, that's so sweet.

I'm so glad
he found someone like you.

Oh. Thank you.

After I threw him out,
I wondered how he'd survive.

He's so needy.

I'm not needy.

- Yeah, you are.
- Yes, you are.

So what's the deal?

Are you guys in it
for the long haul,

or are you just gonna date
and see what happens?

Well, we're just finding
our way for the moment.

Oh, good.

Mm.
Good.

Keep it casual.

That way no one can accuse you
of going after his money.

Excuse me?

I'm not after his money.

Oh, no, you misunderstand.

I... I'm sure you're not,
but unfortunately,

there's no way to prove it.

Luckily, I met him
when he had nothing,

so there's no question
about my intentions.

Are you questioning
my intentions?

No, she's not. She's not.

No, you're not.
You're not, are you?

Of course not.

Are you questioning
my intentions?

Me? No!

Berta, how is
the pot roast coming?

Got another 30 minutes.

You guys keep chatting.

âª Men. âª

I don't understand.

Why is my grandmother
living with his grandmother?

Yeah, I was kind of
wondering that myself,

but I didn't want
to look stupid.

Too late, dude.

You want to handle this, Alan?

Not really.

I wasn't asking.

All right. Um...

Well, fellas, um,

your two grandmas are,
uh... are both very lonely,

and so, they've, uh, decided
to become...

uh, roommates, uh,

and keep each other company.

Oh, that makes sense.
Mm.

Plus, if one of them
falls down,

the other can call
the ambulance.

What if they both fall down
at the same time?

Um, I guess they starve
to death and die.

Unless they go cannibal
and try to eat each other.

If that happens,
I'm betting

on my grandma
eating your grandma.

Dude, there's no way
in the world

that your grandma
eats my grandma.

My grandma totally
eats your grandma.

Nuh-uh. If any grandma's doing
any eating, it's my grandma.

- No way.
- Come on.

My grandma has real teeth.
You happy?

How do you know?

She bit me once.

Well, that was great.

I'm really glad we got
to spend some time together.

Yeah, it was lovely.

Yeah. Oh, don't forget

we have that meeting
with the venture fund tomorrow.

Oh, yeah, right.

Bye.
Oh, bye.

Oh, do me a favor, Zoey.

Don't let him wear sandals
to the meeting.

I really don't tell him
what to wear.

That's okay. You'll learn.

Don't wear sandals
to the meeting.

Good night.
Good night.

Night-night.
Bye. Drive safe.

Mm.

I think that went great.

Do you?

You don't?

I don't.

I don't, either.

Did... Um, did I miss something?

Obviously,
you missed everything.

That horrible woman
won't be happy

till she's destroyed
our relationship,

and she has you back.

What? No!

She has a boyfriend.
She's happy.

Oh, how can you be so smart
about some things

and so stupid about others?

Okay, wait, just to be clear,

what am I smart about
and what am I stupid about?!

Oh, what?
Now you can't hear me!

âª Men. âª

Anybody want more
mashed potatoes?

Oh, gosh, I'm
full, Jean,

but everything's
so delicious.

Thank you.

And how lucky were you to
grow up with Mom's home cooking?

Excuse me. You grew up
with home cooking, too.

Yes, but the maid
did the cooking.

It was still at home.

Make sure
you leave room for dessert.

I made pie.

Oh, I love Grandma's pie.

Yeah, yeah, I heard it, too.

There's something
I'd like to say.

Oh, dear God, here it comes.

It gives me such pleasure
to welcome Jean into my home

and to share our new friendship
with our two families.

Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

Hear, hear.

And I'd just like to thank Evy
for showing me

that it's never too late to
teach an old dog new tricks.

Certainly didn't teach
her to fetch a bone.

Shh.

I have a question.

Oh, God, here it comes.

If you and her
were cannibals,

which do you think
would eat the other?

the upside of stupid.

I'm sorry, Walden,
but Bridget's right.

You have history with her;
you have none with me.

You can't even be sure
I love you for yourself

and not your money.

What are you saying?

I'm saying,
I think it might be better

for both of us
if we went our separate ways.

Okay, that's one approach...

which stinks.

So, let me make
a counterproposal.

Why don't you move in with me?

What?

Yeah, you and Ava
move in with me.

I love you,
and I want you in my life,

I want... I want
to have a future with you.

Really?

Really.

Mummy, Mummy,
please say yes!

What are you doing
out of bed?!

I love you, Walden!

I love you, Ava.

Get back into bed!

Hmm. Let's see.

So, that's one vote for yes,
and I vote yes,

so, the motion is passed.

There is one
tiny little problem.

What's that?

If Ava and I move in,

isn't somebody going
to have to move out?

Hmm.

What's the matter?
I don't know.

Just felt a little shiver
go down my spine.

âª Men. âª

Here you go.

I got to ask.

What's with the tea?

You make it for me.
You make it for Lyndsey.

Well, I've got
a little philosophy.

When someone's nice enough

to let me into their home
or their pants,

I like to show my appreciation.

Without spending
any money.

You know me so well.

So, recap.

How'd your dinner go?

Oh, pretty well, actually.

The grandmas were
on their best behavior,

and the two boys--
well, let's just say,

they're gonna be living with us
for a long, long time. And you?

Oh, good, good.
It went really good.

So, everything's okay with Zoey?
Yeah, it's fantastic.

Sounds like everything's great
with you and Lyndsey, huh?

Oh, yeah, more than good.

Oh, forgot the honey.

She owns her own home, right?

Yeah.

Hmm. Think I may be coming down
with something.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

Why don't you move in with me?

What?

Yeah, you and Ava
move in with me.

I love you,
and I want you in my life,

I want... I want
to have a future with you.

If Ava and I move in,

isn't somebody going
to have to move out?

Hmm.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's the ticket.

Yes. Out with the bad.

Morning.

Morning.

Hey, I'm glad you're up.

I wanted...

Oh, whoa.

Sorry.

Is that really
a good workout?

Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's great for the circulation,

stretches the spine.

Your ball is hanging out.

Oopsie-daisy.

Back in the barn.

Wha... All right, listen, uh,

it's spring break this week,
so Zoey and her daughter

are going to stay here.
Oh, that's nice.

Yeah, it's kind of like
a... trial run.

You know, see what it's like
to live together

before we decide
to do anything permanent.

Oh, that's a good idea.

Living together is tricky.

Ball.

Sorry.

Of course it's going
to be a little tight

with all of us living here.

Yeah.

That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

Oh, don't worry. I'll tell Jake
to go to his mom's.

Good, good.

And I'll make myself scarce.
You won't even know I'm here.

Oop.
Stepped on a duck.

All right, actually,
I'm going to need you to, uh,

move out for the week.

What, wait, the whole week?

Yeah, you and Zoey
don't really gel,

so, I just thought
it'd be for the best.

Oh, oh, that's fine.
Uh, but, uh, you know,

just for the record, I gel
with pretty much everybody.

I mean, ask around,
I'm positively gelatinous.

I know, it's her.

So, the plan is, I come
back after a week?

Uh, you might want to think of
this as a trial run of your own.

I mean, in case
Zoey and I do decide to

live together permanently.

Sure, sure, I get it.

Uh, and, uh,
let me just add that

no one is rooting for your
personal happiness

more than I am.

That's good to hear.

Thanks, man.
Oh, no, no, no.

Thank you, buddy.

No reason to panic.

Just got to find
a temporary new home...

...and three new balls.

âª Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

What are you doing?
I'm taking a break.

Didn't you just get here?

Yeah.

Anyway,

I just wanted
to give you a heads up

that Zoey's going to stay here
for the week.

Uh-huh.
And she's bringing her daughter.

How old?
Seven.

See ya in a week.

Oh, come on, Berta.

You'll love her.
She's adorable.

Maybe to her mother,

and someone who's trying to get
into her mother's pants.

All right, look, it's not going
to be any extra work for you.

What ever Zoey doesn't
take care of, I'll handle.

Really?

You're going to take care
of a seven-year-old?

Yeah.
We get a long great.

And besides,
I got to learn sometime.

I mean, if Zoey and I get
married, I'll be Ava's stepdad.

You know, once upon a time,

a cute little boy came to live
in this house for a few days.

Maybe you've met him.

He's the pot-soaked
masturbating couch potato

who eats all your cookies.

Is he the one who
finished off my macaroons?

Your macaroons and my pot.

My point being,
fool me once, shame on you.

Fool me twice, I want a fully
funded 401 and a Camaro.

Come on, Berta, it's just
going to be for a week,

and it's just
the three of us.

Really? Did Zippy
finally hang himself?

No.

He's going to
stay somewhere else.

Zoey and I want to see what it's
like to live like a family,

with a housekeeper.

Who's got a retirement plan
and a muscle car.

All right, look, Berta, if you
don't want to help me with this,

I will find another housekeeper

who's willing to do very little
work for a very large salary

in a Malibu beach house.

You're cute,
but you got a mean streak.

All right, here we are.

What do you think?

Oh, boy, the ocean!

Stay on the deck!

Oh, she's so excited, she didn't
sleep at all last night.

Yeah, I'm kind of excited, too.

Really? I'm terrified.
Why?

Well, because if this little
experiment doesn't work,

it pretty much means
we're done, doesn't it?

Wow, now I'm terrified, too.

Oh, hey, there she is,

the new queen of the castle,

uh, milady.

Hello, Alan.

Thank you so much
for letting my boyfriend

use his own house
for the week.

Snidely put.

Thank you.
So, where are you staying?

Uh, well, I was thinking that
I was going to rent a suite

at the Bel Air Hotel,
uh, but then I realized

that cost money
and I have none.

So, um, I'm just going
to stay with Lyndsey.

How wonderful for her.

So, um,

all right, I will, uh,
I will see you in a week.

See ya.
In a week.

Yeah.
Say it.

I'll see ya in a week.

Okay, you two have fun.

All right.

Oh, oh, wait.
What room are you planning

to put the little girl in?
Yours.

Oh, oh, well, then I better

get a few things out of there.

Mostly magazines.

Maybe we should put her
in Jake's room.

No, that's actually worse.

âª Men. âª

You ready for another beer?

Oh, aren't you a doll.

You know...

Eldridge is with his
father this week.

Whoo, and Jake's with his mother.
Mmm.

So, I guess we can
do anything we want.

Yeah, and what do you want,
you dirty girl?

Well, you know what would
make me really happy?

Whatever it is,
I'll do it.

The guest toilet is broken.
I want you to fix it.

Uh, are we role-playing?

Am I the naughty plumber

here to snake your drain?

No.

You're the loving boyfriend
here to fix my toilet.

Seriously?

Seriously.

Now?
Now.

All right.

Hey, uh, when you're
done with that,

would you take the patio
furniture out of the garage

and put it in the backyard?

Sure.

Make sure you wash it first.

You got it.

Yep, I got it, all right.

I forgot a few things.
I'm going to run to the store.

Oh, you know, relax.
I'll go for you.

Actually, there's things
I need to buy

that I'd rather
you not know I need.

Say no more.

Put your coat on, Ava.
I don't want to go-- I'm playing.

Ava, come on.
No, she's fine.

I'll watch her.
You sure?

Yeah, of course.
It's no big deal.

Do you want to
stay here with Walden?

Yes, please.

Okay. See you in about an hour

Bye.
Bye.

The sweet, sweet smell
of freedom.

Oh.

Hi.
I'm bored.

I thought you were playing
with your dolls.

I finished.

What do you want to do?

Well...

(Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want
to Have Fun" plays)

âª I come home
in the morning light âª

âª My mother says, "When you
gonna live your life right?" âª

âª Oh, mother dear,
we're not the fortunate ones âª

âª And girls,
they want to have fun âª

âª Oh, girls
just want to have fun âª

âª âª

âª The phone rings
in the middle of the night âª

âª My father yells, "What you
gonna do with your life?" âª

âª Oh, daddy dear, you know
you're still number one âª

âª But girls,
they want to have fun âª

âª Oh, girls just want to have âª

âª That's all they really want âª

âª Some fun âª

âª When the working day is done âª

âª Oh, girls,
they want to have fun âª

âª Oh, girls just want
to have... âª

There's my good girl.

Hi, Mommy.

Where's Walden?

Right there.

He said it's his nap time.

âª Men. âª

I think I found your problem!

You have got
a blown out fuse!

Can you fix it?

I don't see any
spare fuses but, uh,

I do know a little trick.
What's that?

Well, most people
don't know this,

but you can use
an ordinary copper penny

to replace a fuse.
No kidding?

Yeah, electricians
won't tell you

'cause they
want to charge you...

It worked! The TV's back on!

âª Men. âª

"They were married
soon after,

"and lived happily together
for many, many years.

The end."

Big surprise, huh?

Thank God.

It's too dark.

Oh, sorry. Here you go.

That's too bright.

Okay. Uh... how about...

I turn the bathroom light on
and leave the door open a crack?

How's that?

Better.

All right.

Good night.

Did you look under the bed?

No. Why, did you find
some funny magazines?

You have to check for monsters.

Oh.

Nope, no monsters.

Okay. Good night.

What about the closet?

What about it?

Monsters.

I don't want to have nightmares.

Right.

It's all clear.

Aah... great.

Now I'm gonna have nightmares.

Okay, okay, good night.

I'm thirsty.

You're joking.

Why would I joke about thirsty?

Thirsty's not funny.

I'll get you a glass of water.

No, I want fizzy water.

You want Perrier?

Pellegrino would be fine.

Okay.

I'll go see what we have.

How did the story end?

Uh... they got married,

and they lived happily together
for many, many years.

Till they had kids.

âª Men. âª

How are you feeling?

All right.

My hand's still a little numb.

Well, let's see if I can
make it all better.

Mmm...
Ooh! Ooh!

Make it all better.

Daddy like.
Mmm...

Did you hear something?

Mm, nothing but the
rustling in my jammies.

No!

There's someone downstairs.

No, there isn't. Come
on, make it all better.

Alan!

There's someone
in the house. Go look.

Really? With a dead hand and
the beginnings of an erection?

Go.

And thus ends the erection.

Who keeps their weed
in the crisper?

What, you want to get
crispy, don't you?

Ow!

Good morning.

It's still dark out.

It's breakfast time.

Maybe in London.

What's going on?

She wants breakfast.

Okay.

Just give me a minute.

No, you sleep;
I'll get it.

Thanks.

That's it? No argument?

Shh...

All right.

What do you want?

Corn Flakes or Cheerios or...

Eggs Benedict.

Of course.

âª Men. âª

Watch your step.

Yeah, wouldn't want
to get hurt.

Those pain pills starting
to kick in yet?

Oh, yeah.

You could spread me on a toast.

Okay.

Let's get you into bed.

No, no.

Let's get you into bed.

Seriously?

You want to fool around?

Parts of me do.

Mr. Nose says, "No," but Mr.
Hose says (falsetto): "Yes""

Tell you what,

why don't you just lie down
and let me take care of you.

Really?

You took care of me when I thought
there was someone in the house.

Oh, right, right, I did.

I was brave.

Let's just get this belt
and zipper undone.

Good thing you could breathe
through your nose.

- Ow! - What?!
Ball snag!

Oh, sorry!
No, no, don't touch it!

Don't...! Oh!

I think I broke Mr. Hose.

Hey!

What?

What in the hell
happened here?

I tried to make breakfast
for the kid.

"Tried"?

Yeah. The eggs were too runny,

so I made oatmeal
that was too dry,

so I made waffles
that were-- and I quote--

"Bloody dreadful."

Where is she now?

I don't know; I don't care.

I can't do this, Berta.

It's just... it's too much.

She just never stops.

Yeah, I raised
four daughters.

The only thing that slows them
down is jail and johnsons.

I told Zoey
we were gonna be a family.

What am I gonna do?

The kid's seven?

Yeah.

Wait nine years.

What happens in nine years?

If you're lucky, she runs away
with a coke-addled bass player.

And if I'm not lucky?

A drummer.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Oh, you're up.

How are you feeling?

A little better.

I'm glad.

Not looking forward
to ripping the Band-Aid

off my scrotum, but...

we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

I'm so, so sorry.

Yeah, just...

FYI, if you'd like to try again,
I'm wearing sweatpants.

No zipper.

I cannot believe
you're still horny.

Me neither,
but there it is.

Well, I do owe you one.

Oh, boy.

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Do you smell that?

Oh, don't worry.

That's just the Neosporin.

No.

It-it smells
like something dead.

It's not Mr. Hose.

He's very much alive.

Go ahead. Check.

I think it's coming
from under the house.

I'm sorry, I-I really
can't smell anything

'cause of my broken nose...

'cause of what you owe me.

It-it's probably just a raccoon
or a possum.

Hang on one sec.

Let me call the exterminator.

Oh, no, no, no,
that's going to take too long.

I'll ju... I'll just get
a shovel and a garbage bag

and deal with it.

You're that horny?

I know, it's starting
to worry me, too.

You okay down there?

Yeah. Yeah, I think I see it.

Looks like a-a dead possum.

Be careful.

Oh, don't worry about it.

I-I'm just going
to shovel him into my...

Not dead! Not dead!

Ow! Ow!

Yah! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

I didn't mean...
Ow! No! Ow!

Come on!

Oh, that's going
to get infected.

Ah! Ahh!

âª Men. âª

Thank you.

Hey.

Oh, hey.
Thanks for meeting me, man.

Whoa!

What happened to you?

Well, let's see, uh...

Electrocuted, got
my nose bashed in,

and possibly rabies.

How are you?

I am really tired.

My heart bleeds for you.

Also my left ball sack.

What's that smell?

Oh, Neosporin, which
just a hint of possum.

So, uh, how are things going
living with Zoey and her daughter?

It's good, it's good.

Oh.

How's living with Lyndsey?

Oh, it's terrific.

That's great.

That's great.

If I could get rid of them...
Yes! A hundred times yes!

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

It's spring break this week,
so Zoey and her daughter

are going to stay here.

I'm going to need you
to move out for the week.

Where you staying?

I'm just going to have
to stay with Lindsey.

There's someone
in the house. Go look.

Ow!
What?!

Ball snag!
I'm sorry!

No, no, don't touch it!

I'm bored.

âª âª

I can't do this, Berta.
It's just too much.

She just never stops.

So, how are things going living
with Zoey and her daughter?

It's good. It's good.

Oh.

How's living with Lyndsey?

Oh, it's terrific.
That's great.

So, if I could get rid of them...
Yes, 100 times yes.

Men...

Okay.

Zoey...

you know I love you, and...

I want to live with you forever.

But we got to lose the kid.

- Yeah, probably not.
-  Okay.

Hey, have you ever thought
of Swiss boarding schools?

Hi!
Sh...

She's out like a light.

Really? How?
Did you drug her?

I didn't think
we were allowed to drug her.

She's worn out
from playing with you all day.

She's not the only one.

Listen...

I've been thinking about this

whole "moving in together"
thing.

It's all right.
I admit, I had my doubts.

But you have been
so wonderful with her.

Thank you.

This little girl
loves you so much.

Really...

You're all she talks about.

The sun rises and sets with you.

Huh...

Look at what she made for you.

Wow...

So, you win.
We're all yours.

I mean,

there's a million details
to figure out

before we can move in
permanently.

First and foremost, where she's
going to go to school.

Have you ever considered
Switzerland?

You're kidding, right?

I'm ki.. of course!

Why would I want her
so far away?

Let me put her up to bed.
Then we can start making plans.

Great.

Mommy?
Hmm?

Where's Walden?

Oh, I'm right here.

I love you, Walden.

I love you...

Just like I planned it.

Hey, roomie!

You got here quick.

Yeah, Lyndsey asked me
to fix the garbage disposal

and I didn't like the odds.

So, uh, did you talk
to Zoey yet?

Yes, I did.

How'd she take it?

Well, I... yeah, let's...

Did she cry?

No...
Yelling?

No. There was no yelling.

Yeah, I know that I said
that I wanted to get rid of her

and have you come back...

Oh, no!

You know, I, I love her.

Oh, no!

And I, I love the kid.

No!

I'm just going
to have to make it work.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Alan, I'm sorry.

Okay, okay, I'll...
I'll figure something out.

If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

Okay, very funny.
Survivor, I get it.

Oh, come on!
I feel bad enough already.

Help me...

911!

Oh, okay. I'll play along.

Here, would 100 dollars

make you better?

You're not kidding?

Not kidding...

Don't die.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

I want him to have
the best possible care.

So, whatever it takes,
I'll pay for it.

You're going to have to.

The man's got the worst
insurance policy I've ever seen.

What do you mean?
He's got a $500,000 deductible.

A $500,000 deductible?

Even at our prices,
he ain't gonna

hit that with
one heart attack.

All right, well, I'll just...
I'll take care of it.

Just check the box
"Domestic Partner."

Oh, no, we're just buddies.

We got no buddy forms.

Yeah, but...
Just check the damn box.

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

I guess there's nothing
to do now but wait.

Forgive me
for being callous,

but don't you think this heart
attack is a bit convenient?

What?
Come on.

He tries to weasel his way
back into the house.

You tell him no

and he falls to the ground,
clutching his chest.

You think he faked
a heart attack?

I think he'd fake
a shark attack.

How do you fake
a shark attack?

I don't know. Ask Alan.

Harper?

Yeah, right here.

Okay, well, your boyfriend's
going to be fine.

That's great.

Uh, he's not my...

It's great.

It was the form.
It was just easier.

Um, did he actually
have a heart attack?

It was a mild one, but yes.
Told you.

He should be fine.
He's just going to need rest

and as little stress
as possible.

For how long?

I don't know,
at least a month or two.

Great...

That's why we gave up women.
Am I right?

It's a compelling argument.

Hi.

Hi, Walden.

How ya feelin'?

Fan-tastic.

I'm on a morphine drip.

Everyone should have
a morphine drip.

There would be no more war.

Listen, the doctor said

that you... had
a little heart attack,

but you're going to be fine.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I remember now.

Zoey's moving in and...

I'm... I'm moving out.

No, you're not moving out.

I'm-I'm not?

No, you can stay as long as you
want. As long as you need.

Oh.

Oh, that's...
that's so good to hear.

Thataboy.

I just... I just want you
to not worry about anything.

I won't.

Okay.

You just relax
and feel better, okay?

Okeydokey.

Hey, Walden. Guess what?

What?

I'm peeing right now.

No kidding.

But it's okay.

There's a tube
attached to my wiener.

I don't think there is.

Oh...

Men...

- My God. He's going to be okay?
- Yeah.

He just needs
to take it easy.

I don't know
what I would do

if anything
happened to him.

I've already lost my good son!

Do you happen to know
if they validate parking?

So, are those tubes
putting stuff in

or taking stuff out?

I think
a little bit of both.

Oh, I get it.

It's like eating
on the toilet.

So, what did the doctor say?

Uh, he just said
he needs to take it easy.

You know, no stress.

Then I guess
we shouldn't tell him

about what happened
at school.

No, we definitely
should not.

Honest to God, someone
put that pot in my locker.

Why would they do that?

That, my friend,
is the million-dollar question.

Look, Lyndsey,

I know you're his girlfriend,

and I know you'd like
to take care of him, but...

I kind of feel
responsible for this.

And I'd like him to stay
with me until he recovers.

Fine. Let's go
get some coffee.

Men...

Wake up, Alan.

Is it spongebath time again?

You wish.

What's going on?

Who are you?

Ah, Alan, that hurts.

Don't you recognize
your own brother?

Men...

What is this,
some kind of sick joke?

Charlie's dead.

You're dubious. Understandable.

When you were 14 years old,

you went to your first
boy/girl party,

and you were really nervous

because they were going to play
spin the bottle.

Yeah?

So, before you left the house,

I convinced you that
the grownup way to French-kiss

was to spit in the
other person's mouth.

You hocked a big loogie
down Marcy Bilson's throat

and she'd kicked you
in the nuts.

Ah, come on, everybody in
high school knew that story.

Answer me this:

What are your five favorite
words to hear from a woman?

"I can't spend the night."

Charlie...

At your service.

I don't...
I don't understand.

Are you reincarnated
or something?

Nah, I'm in hell.

Walking around
in this old broad's body

is supposed to be some kind
of eternal damnation.

You know what?

The joke's on them.

Boobs are still boobs.

So, why are you here?

I thought you could use
a little help.

I have been through
a rough patch.

You look like you've been
through a propeller.

I came here to tell you
it's not too late

to turn your life around.

How?

Stop being a parasite.

Step up. Be a man.
Grow a pair.

Uh, parenthetically,
this body actually has a pair.

They dangle
right under my hooha.

Did not need to know that.

Point being, you lived on me
for eight years

and now you're
living off this new guy.

Now, now, hang on.
W-Walden's my friend.

He invited me
to stay with him.

Oh, kiss my
surprisingly tight ass.

You're nobody's friend.

You're a useless appendage,
like tonsils,

or the nutsack
under my hooha.

I see hell hasn't
mellowed you out any.

Listen to me,
you got to get out

of that guy's house
and make a life for yourself.

I suppose I could go
live with Lyndsey.

You're missing my point.

I'm not suggesting
that the tapeworm

find a new colon
to crawl into.

Hold out your hand.

Thank you.

This is your last chance, Alan.

Move out of that house.
Get your own place.

Start pulling your own weight
in the world.

Okay. I will.

You'll see.
I can change.

Good.

Then my work here is done.

Well, thanks, Charlie.

You got it.

Oh, uh,

Before I go...

...you gotta check this out.

Oh!

Oh!

Was I lying?

Tell me that's not disturbing.

Men...

What do you want me
to do, Zoey?

The last time I asked him
to leave, he almost died.

Well, what does that mean?

He lives with you
until he actually does die?

No, just until he
gets back on his feet.

The man has no feet.

He is a footless man.

Okay, come on.

What about his mother?
Why doesn't he live with her?

They don't really get along.

What about his girlfriend?

They don't really get along.

Oh, God.

So we're stuck with him forever.

The man is the herpes
of houseguests.

Come on.
That is not fair.

You're right.

Herpes sometimes disappears
for a while.

Surprise!

Alan.

Herpes.

What? They let you out?

Oh, no, no.
I checked myself out.

I didn't want you to have
to pay one more penny for me.

Oh, come on.

The money is not important.

What's important
is your health.

No, what's important
is that I stop being a parasite

and stand on my own two feet.

You have no feet.

What was that?

It's Zoey.

I'll be right there, honey.

I'm just going to grab my stuff,
and I'll get out of your hair.

Are you sure?

I am positive, Walden.
I-I have had an epiphany.

I need to make a big change
in my life.

Wow.

Where will you go?

Oh, I found a cute little place
online.

Uh, you know, it's not much,

but, uh, at least
I'll have my pride.

I don't know, Alan.

Let the man have his pride!

Uh, here's my address
for mailing stuff.

If this is what you want...

It's what I want.

It's what everybody wants!

Don't listen to her.

Oh, no, no.
She's right.

She's an angry,
cold-hearted tea bag!

But she's right.

What did he say?

He said that you were right.

Men...

No, Jake.

If I'm not living
at the beach house,

you're not living
at the beach house.

Yeah, well, sometimes
life just isn't fair.

Well, sure you can visit me
where I'm living now.

But, uh, you're not going
to have your own room

or your own bed
or your own bathroom

and... you might need
to have a tetanus shot.

But I'd love to have you.

Okay, you let me know.

Okay, good night.

All right.

It's not much, but...

it's mine.

I am self-sufficient.

And beholden to no one.

Oh, that's not a good sign.

Men...

It's odd...

But now that
Alan's finally gone,

I actually kind of miss him.

Yeah, me too.

Walden, I'm kidding.

Oh, yeah, me too.

So...

Now that we have the house
to ourselves,

what would you like to do?

What I would like to do

is you.

And where I would like to do it,

is on every flat surface

in every room of this house.

Mm.
Mm.

Woo. Hey.

Oh. Jake.

This is my friend, Gabby.

Hi!

We're going to go hang out
in my room.

Uh, Jake, uh,

hold on.

Have you spoken
to your father lately?

No, I don't believe I have.

Look at the bright side.

What bright side?

He might share some
of his pot with us.

Men...

Wake up, buttercup.

Oh. Hey, Charlie.

So, what do you think?

I finally got my own place.

Fantastic.

You're not sponging off
that rat, are you?

There's a rat?

Nah, I'm just kiddin'.

He's dead.

But aren't you proud of me?
I mean, I did what you said.

I'm standing
on my own two feet.

Yeah.

Sucker.

What?

I had to come back
from hell to do it,

but I finally gotcha
out of my freakin' house!

But I-I-I thought you wanted me
to be a better person.

Nope.

What? So you were just
screwing with me?

Yep.

Why?

I'm in hell, Alan.
That's kind of what we do.

Whoa!

What a horrible dream.

What's so horrible about it?

Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

Still here.

I can do this aaalll night.

Men...

Okay.

How do we sell this?
Uh...

911...

911!

Come on. You can
do better than that. Uh...

Ah...

Help me.

Call 911.

Am I dying
or taking a dump?

Ah.

Call 911...
Call 911...

Yeah, that's it. Okay.

Showtime.

Alan...

Don't, don't worry.
I'm not moving back in.

I just forgot a few things.

Yeah, like your son?

Wait. Jake's here?

Yeah, and his girlfriend.

Ah,  you know,
damn that kid.

I told him I was moving out and
he was not to come back here.

But does he listen to me? No.

You know, no one ever
listens to me and I...

Call 911.

Call 911.
Oh, no, not again.

Hold on.
I'll get help.

Son of a bitch.

What's the matter?
Couldn't find a shark?

Men...

So, what do you think, Doc?

We won't know until
we get all the tests back,

but right now, his heart
appears to be perfectly fine.

Thank God.

So how long before
I can take him home?

Walden?

I am sorry, Zoey,
but I am not going to have

this man's death
on my conscience.

I'd like to thank the Academy.

There are no small parts...

only small apartments.

I don't think you're allowed
to smoke in here.

Does that include the joint
you just blew in the bathroom?

How'd you know about that?

Call it women's intuition,
taterhead.

Whoa, the only person
that ever called me "taterhead"

was my uncle Charlie.

So, what does that
tell ya?

I have no idea.

Screw it.
I'm going back to hell.

Ready, ladies?

You bet.
We are.

Then let's go.

And me with with just a nutsack.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

I know that I said that I wanted
to get rid of her

and have you come back...
Oh, no!

I'm just going to have
to make it work.

No, no, no, no, no!

I'm sorry!

Okay, I'll figure something out.

If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

Doctor said you had
a little heart attack.

Yeah, I remember now.

Zoey's moving in...

and I'm moving out...

No...

No... you're not moving out.

I'm not?

No, you can stay
as long as you want,

as long as you need.

Oh, that's... that's so good to hear.

Really, you don't have
to carry my bags.

Alan, you had
a heart attack, okay?

You need to take it easy.

Well, I appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

Whoa, do not say that.

Why not?

Let me tell you
about my Grandma Abigail.

When I was a kid,
she came to move in with us.

And one day I said,
"How ya doing, Grandma""

And she said, "Fine."
And then she dropped dead.

You're kidding.

No, face down in my Legos.

Well, that's terrible.

But I'm fine.
Do not say that!

My Uncle Hal?

When I was a kid, he used
to spend Thanksgivings us,

and one year,
we're at dinner and...

you know, like football
and turkey and the whole bit,

and I said,
"How ya doing, Uncle Hal""

And he said, "Fine""

And then he went
to the bathroom,

and he crapped out
his small intestines.

Oh, oh... okay,
t-that's horrible,

but I promise you,
I am fine.

Surprise!

I told you not to say it!

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

Oh, my God,
somebody call 911.

Gotcha.

Oh...

Alan, don't you ever
do that to me again.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

So all you guys came
just to welcome me back?

Of course we did, darling.
We were worried about you.

Yeah, I've been beside myself
with concern.

I don't know what to say.
I'm really touched.

Come here, Alan.

Sit down.
I made you some tea.

Wait, did you just
call me Alan?

Well, that's your name,
isn't it?

Yeah, but you always
call me Zippy.

I know, but I've got
a little rule.

I never make fun of someone who
could come back and haunt me.

Sugar or honey?

I thought we decided on Alan?

Uh, honey, please.

Hey, are you warm enough?

Do you want me
to turn up the heat?

I'm fine.
Don't say that...

Okay, turn up the heat.

Why don't you just lay down.

Uh, no, really, I'm good.
I've been in bed for a week.

Do it for me.

Uh, okay, but let me
just point out

that that never works
when I say that to you.

Guess what. While you were
in the hospital,

I aced all my final exams.

Really?!
I don't believe it!

I told you
he wouldn't buy it.

Wait, wait, wait.
You lied to me?

Uh, I told him to. I thought
the truth might kill you.

But there is some real good news.
What's that?

I found out for sure
I'm not gay.

But why's that good news?

It's mostly good news
for gay people.

A-A-All right, look,
I appreciate

all the trouble you're taking
to welcome me home,

but if you don't mind, I'd just
like to go back to my room.

Oh, you heard him.

He wants to go to his room.
Here, Zoey.

Take the tea.

Walden, I can walk on my own.

That's what my
blind Aunt Shirley said.

And then we went to Miami

on Christmas vacation,

and then "blam""

Greyhound came out of nowhere
and flattened her.

She got hit by a bus?

No, she wandered
onto the dog track

in the middle
of the ninth race.

Technically,
she came in third.

Anyway, I got a little
âª surprise for you. âª

Oh, Walden, you've already
done so much.

I don't know what else
you could possibly...

A real bed!
Yeah.

It's not just a bed.
Get on it. Check it out.

Oh, my golly.

Ah...
Oo-ho-ho-ho!

The bed is becoming tumescent.

Yeah...!

Pretty cool, uh?

See, so you don't have
to exert yourself

when you're getting
in and out.

Ah! Oh,

and what pray tell is that?

That is a 46" high-definition
plasma screen TV,

complete with a deluxe sports
satellite package

Nice! No movies?

No, we could switch it
to a movie package.

Or you could add it.

Oh, okay, we'll add it.

And don't forget
the adult channels.

No problem.

You have to ask
for them specifically.

Otherwise they block them.

Right.

Hey, why don't you take
a nap until dinner?

I'm not tired.

That's what my
cousin Earl said

right before he fell asleep
with a cigarette in his hand.

Set his bed on fire?

No, his fireworks stand.

I was standing across the street
yelling at him to wake up

when the first rocket went off,
followed by 800 Roman candles.

It was horrifying and really
cool at the same time.

Okay, I'll take a nap.

Good, good, good,
you just...

I don't want you
to do anything.

Just relax
and get better.

That's a nice thought, Walden,

but I got a lot of work to do.

I got bills to pay.

No, don't worry about the bills.

I'll take care of everything.

Walden, I can't let you
just take care of everything.

Listen, I made a promise to
myself when I was 11 years old

and salmonella decimated
my father's entire side

of the family
at the annual Easter egg hunt.

Nobody else dies on my watch.

Poor guy,
living with all that guilt.

I can exploit that.

How come you're not coming over?

I can't. I have Ava.

Why don't you come over here?

I can't. I have Alan.

Oh, for God's sake.

Well, he had
a heart attack, Zoey.

Oh, bollocks.

He's going to outlive us all.

A week after nuclear Armageddon,
the world will be populated

by nothing but cockroaches
and Alan Harper.

Wow, that is a side of you
that is not attractive.

It's the lawyer side of me.

Yeah, yuck.

Look, I see these kind
of scam artists all the time

and I don't want
you being taken advantage of.

I am just taking care
of my friend.

No, you are providing food,
shelter, and satellite TV

to a cockroach.

Hello, anybody?

Getting kind of hungry
in here.

Uh, B-Berta, Alan's hungry.

Is his dinner ready yet?

Coming up.

Really?

He gets room service?

Did I ever tell you
about my Aunt Phyllis?

When I was a kid she took me
on a trip to New York,

and we were staying
at the Waldorf-Astoria,

and she didn't want
to wait for room service,

so she headed down
to the restaurant

and she fell 24 stories
down an empty elevator shaft.

We never got to see Cats.

So you're afraid Alan is going
to fall into an elevator shaft?

Don't poke at it, Zoey.
The wound is still fresh.

Come in.

Did my little buddy save
room for dessert?

I sure did, Skipper.

Good, 'cause I made
your favorite.

Peach cobbler?
Yep.

Warm with ice cream?

I'll be right back.

I'm not going anywhere.

Okay, let's see
what's on those adult channels.

Avatart.

Oh, in 3D.

Oh, to be continued.

Come in.

Hey, you.

Judith, what a,
what a nice surprise.

How are you feeling?

Not bad, all things considered.

Oh, you're so brave.

Now, listen, there's something
we need to talk about.

Look, I know the child support
checks are late,

but, but please allow me
to get back to my job.

Er?

Forget the
child support.

Er?

You just get better.

I can manage fine
without your money.

All right.

I always suspected as much,
but thank you.

And Herb and I have the
condo in Palm Springs,

so you're certainly
welcome to use it

while you're
recuperating.

How can you afford
a condo in Palm Springs?

We made a judgment call
with Jake's college fund.

Anyway, you're
welcome to use it.

Wow, thank you,
th-that's very generous.

Well, look, I know we've
obviously had our differences.

We have.

And I haven't always
been very nice to you.

I just figured
you didn't like me.

Alan, we were married
for 12 years.

You're the father
of my son.

Just because I couldn't
stay married to you

doesn't mean I
stopped loving you.

Gee, it sure felt
that way.

Oh, I'm sorry
for that.

You just get
well, okay?

Okay.

A house in Malibu,
no child support,

free condo in Palm Springs.

Why would anyone want
to eliminate heart disease?

Don't worry,
you lovely blue ladies,

as soon
as my right hand is free,

I'll be giving you
my full attention.

Rats.

Uh...

Come in.

How's my man?

Oh, you know, okay

for a guy who recently stared
into the jaws of death.

That's why I'm here.

I want to help
with your recovery.

Really, what'd
you have in mind?

I-I'm not supposed
to exert myself.

Don't worry, you don't have
to do a thing.

Just lie back
and I'll do all the work.

Really?

Hmm.
Okay.

Uh, let me put
my cobbler down.

No, no, no,
keep it.

You sure?

Absolutely.

It'd be rude for
me to eat alone.

All righty then.

You got any porn
on this thing?

Uh, gee, I,
I don't know.

Why don't you check?

Shake things up a bit.

Oh, gosh,
well, I, yeah,

I guess I, I guess I,
I-I could do that.

Oh, look,
there's some now.

How fortuitous.

Now, just relax and
enjoy your cobbler.

Right back at you.

This is the best day
of my entire life.

âª Men. âª

All right, Mr. Harper.

Well, I've got
some good news.

Let me have it.

I'm banging my receptionist.

I'm sorry.

I... I never get tired
of that one.

That-that's funny,
but, uh, what about me?

No, you don't have
a chance with her.

She likes rich guys.

All right,
back to your, uh, heart.

It's looking good.

Uh, are you sure?

Tests show you've had no damage.

Your cholesterol looks normal.

It's like the heart attack
never even happened.

Oh.

And you're not happy about that?

No, I-I am.

Um, uh, is this confidential,
what we're saying?

Think of me as a priest.

Except, when I touch your nuts,
it's strictly business.

Okay, uh... uh, uh, here it is.

Um, ever since the heart attack,

uh, my life
has actually gotten better.

Uh, my girlfriend,
my ex-wife,

even my mother
have all been showering me

with love and attention.

Well, they were afraid
they were losing you.

Have you ever had oral sex
and peach cobbler?

At the same time?

Can't say that I have.

Well, I have.

And once my girlfriend
finds out that I'm healthy,

I'm back to sucking Life Savers
and humping my pillow.

Well, as your doctor,
all I can tell you

is you're
perfectly healthy.

Can I get a second opinion?

Yes, you're ugly, too.

I joke.

Uh, again, as your doctor,

I have to tell you
you're in great shape.

But, uh...

as a guy who's banging
his receptionist,

two pharmaceutical reps

and, uh, on occasion,
his bloated, rich wife,

let me add:

Don't be a schmuck.

Lie your ass off.

Thanks, Doc.
That's good advice.

Hmm.

Jeanine, hi.

Uh, listen, could you
run down to the deli

and pick up a peach cobbler

and meet me in exam room 2.

How'd it go?

Good news?

It's bad, Mom.

It's real bad.
Oh.

Darling, I am so sorry.

Hey, I know what
would cheer you up.

So do I.

No, I was thinking
I could take you shopping.

Come on, now.

There must be something
I can get you

that would turn
that frown upside down.

Well, uh, remember
when I was a kid

how I always wanted
to be a cowboy?

I'm not going to buy you
a horse, Alan.

Of course not.

Guess I'll just have to be
a cowboy in Heaven.

Are your eyes closed?

Yep, they're closed.

Open.

You must be kidding me.

It's the safest way for Alan
to get up and down the stairs.

Why does he have to get
up and down the stairs?

So he can use my whirlpool tub.

Oh, dear Lord.

He needs it for his circulation.

He said he's starting
to get bed sores.

Then you tell him
to get out of bed.

You don't build him
his own private escalator.

Howdy, pardner.

Ma'am.

Wow.

You look great.

Just checking it
off my bucket list.

What'd the doctor say?

It's not good.

I might have to have
a transplant.

I'm sorry.

Let's just hope that somewhere

there's a baboon
with a healthy heart

riding a motorcycle
without a helmet.

For God's sake.

Excuse me.
I'm going to take a whirlpool

until my masseuse gets here.

You got him a masseuse?

It helps prevent blood clots.

Yeah.

My Uncle Fred
had a blood clot in his leg,

and when I was little,
he took me

to the Santa Monica Pier,
and we went on the Tilt-A-Whirl,

and the centrifugal force
shot the clot into his brain.

It was the worst birthday ever.

He's seen a lot
of tragedy, Zoey.

Be nice to him.

Mmm.

Too hard?

Nah, dig in.
I like it rough.

Brought your
banana smoothie.

Oh, thank you, Zoey.

Um, would you mind

sticking the straw
in my donut hole?

Oh, I would love to.

Mmm.

Tasty.

I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

You may have everyone
else around here fooled,

but I know you're
full of crap.

Beg pardon?

What you do with
your family

and your girlfriend
is your business,

but I want you to stop
taking advantage of Walden.

I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

I-I'm sorry. I really
don't know what you're...

You've been warned.

Well, thanks for the...
the smoothie, Zoey.

That bitch has got to go.

How about that?

Stars really are just like us.

Alan.
Oh!

Oh, my.

Careful.

You don't want
to give me a heart attack.

We need to talk to you.

Oh, yeah, sure.

I'll be right back.

Um, think I left
the tub running, so...

Stop.

Now, get out of that chair
and get down here.

Okay.

The queen has spoken.

My legs are still
a little al dente.

So...

what up?

I'll tell you "what up."

I asked one of the private
investigators for my law firm

to follow you for a few days.

Really?

Uh, uh, wh-which days
in particular?

Well,

this is from last Monday,

when you said you were going

for a therapeutic walk
on the beach.

Okay. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, you know...

I can see

how this looks,

um,

but, you know, actually,

there is a-a-a very...

a very simple, uh,
uh, explanation.

Okay.

Well...

we got cobbler
in the kitchen.

911?

Anybody?

âª Men. âª

How long do you plan
on lying there?

Until the shame passes.

So a while?

Oh, yeah.

All right.

Well...

sleep well.

Thanks. You, too.

âª Memories âª

âª Light the corners of my mind âª

âª Misty watercolored memories
of the way we were... âª

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on:

So, what have you
been up to?

I started a new
software company

with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

Yes. We have the technology now.

Something you should know.

It's about your ex-wife.

What, Bridget?

Yeah. I'm, uh...

kind of sleeping with her.

What?
Wait! Hey!

Morning.

It's 2:00 p.m.

So?

It's Saturday; I slept in.

It's Sunday.

Really?

That's disturbing.

So what did you do last night
that you had to sleep all day?

One thing at a time.

I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to Saturday.

Jake, you're gonna graduate
high school in a few days.

Don't you think it's time

to start getting
your life together?

I will if you will.

What?

I will certainly
consider that, Father.

This is serious.

You will never amount to
anything if you sleep all day.

WALDEN:
Morning.

I'm sorry, I was distracted

by the naked billionaire
that just woke up.

Shut up and eat
your damn cereal.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª

Man, I did not think Jeremy
was ever gonna stop talking.

Yeah.

That guy really puts the "dict"
in "valedictorian."

Thinks he's so great just
'cause he's going to Harvard.

Where is Harvard anyway?

Dude, didn't you learn
anything in high school?

It's the capital of Connecticut.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

Harvard, Connecticut.

What'd you think
was the capital of Connecticut?

"C."

(laughs)

You're an idiot.

I don't know why
I hang out with you.

'Cause you're gay.

Well, what does that make you?

Attractive.

So are your parents giving you
a hard time about your "future"?

Oh, yeah.

Both my mom and my dad.

I'm sick of hearing it.

Yeah. "If you're not going to
college, you need to get a job""

Where do they
get this stuff?

Beats me.

So what are we gonna do?

About what?

Our future.

Oh.

I could go for
some frozen yogurt.

Good idea, man.

Let's go.

Should we take
our robes off?

No, no, leave them on.

They'll attract smart chicks.

Come on, Judith.
He's your son too.

I have videotape of him
shooting out of your body.

Yes, I've talked to him

about his lack of plans,
but it's like talking to a wall.

A very good-natured,
but dense wall.

Of course I'm concerned,
but what do you want me to do?

No, I'm not gonna ask Walden
to give him a job.

Because it would
be an imposition.

Yes, more of an imposition
than me living there for free.

Okay, okay, if it'll get you
to shut up, I'll ask him.

She's never
gonna shut up.

Okay, okay.

Good-bye, Judith.

(scoffs)

I am so thankful
I have you in my life.

What about my son?

What about him?

You're gonna ask Walden for a
job for Jake, but not Eldridge?

Of course not.

I was just gonna hold Eldridge
back to sweeten the deal.

BILLY:
I have a question.

What?

Why didn't you order
adjustable chairs?

I did.

Mine's adjustable.

Well, wait.

How'd you do that?

This lever right here.

I don't have a lever.

Hmm?

Well, that's too bad,
you being so short and all.

You did this to get back at me.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

For sleeping with your ex-wife.

Do you really think
that I am so petty

that I would pay a chair
manufacturer an extra $480

to remove the adjustable
height feature?

That is crazy talk.

How's everything down there
at the Lollipop Guild?

Hey, guys.

Am I interrupting?

Hey, Alan.

Just thought
I'd bring you by

a little office-warming
dieffenbachia.

Ah, thank you.

Looks like you got the place
up and running.

We're getting there.

Electric Suitcase, Inc.

Very, very impressive.
(laughs)

What can I do for you?

Oh, nothing. I just came
to drop off my gift

and wish you well.

Okay.

Okay, well, I'll get out
of your hair.

Uh, nice to see
you again.

Yep. Always a thrill.

Oh, there is one thing.

Here we go.
Here we go.

Um, you know Jake
just graduated high school.

Oh, hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the ceremony.

Oh, don't be silly.
No one expected you to.

You know what?
Here...

why don't you give this
to him for me.

Ooh, a hundred dollars.

I will make sure he gets this.

What? I-I don't
even know the kid.

Oh, of course not.
(laughs)

Um, anyway, I was
just wondering, um,

since you've started
this exciting venture

and obviously you're hiring,

that there might be
an opportunity here for Jake.

He's not going to college?

Not unless he's
delivering pizzas.

Uh, probably true,

but he has a good heart,

and I'm afraid if I
can't find him a decent job,

he might have to sell it.

Okay, listen, Alan, I'm sorry.

I-I like Jake,

but I just don't think
we have anything for him here.

Oh, oh, okay.

I understand.
You know, he's just my kid.

Our future. But, um,

but thanks anyway.

Oh, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it.

Yeah? Yeah?

Does he know anything
about computers at all?

Not per se,
but he is eager to learn.

He's like a sponge when it comes
to soaking up information.

No, he isn't.

Will you at least give me
the sponge part?

Yeah, if you lay him
on a wet spot,

he might absorb liquid.

Why are you being
such a jerk, man?

Let's give
the boy a shot.

Billy,

I've seen this kid spend
an entire afternoon

smoking dope and trying
to lick his own nipples.

Who amongst us
hasn't... done...

Look, we will...
we will take him on, okay?

Billy...
He'll be my responsibility.

Oh, thank you so much.
You will not regret it.

Yes, you will.
I will send him right over.

Oh, one more thing,

uh, my girlfriend's son
needs a job too,

but you're gonna love him,
he's...

blonde. Bye.

Okay, I'm telling you
right now,

this is a bad idea.

How did you do that?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Okay, fellas...

this is the heart and soul

of The Electric Suitcase.

300 state of the art,

high bandwidth servers

all working
in tandem.

Cool.
Awesome.

Any questions so far?

Uh, yeah.
Is there a cafeteria

or do we order in?

There's a cafeteria
on the 14th floor.

Oh. Cool.
I got a question.

Yes?

Do they have donuts?

Was I lying?

I don't know if I have donuts.

That's okay.
It's not a deal-breaker.

Glad to hear it.

Uh, okay, guys...

all you have to do
between now

and 8:00 tomorrow morning,

is watch the lights
on these servers, all right?

If a green goes to red,

it means the drive
is about to fail

so all you do...

you pop it out

and you replace it

with a fresh one
from right here.

Got it. No problem.
All right.

Oh, and there's no smoking dope
in this building.

No, sir.
Absolutely not.

Not inside the building.

Or outside the building.

How about the roof?

No.

What about before
we come to work?

No!

What about brownies?

There's no pot, period!

No brownies, no God, no roof,
no outside, no inside.

No problem.
All right.

Good.

Oh, and we just want
to take this opportunity

to thank you both for
this great opportunity.

'Cause let's face it,
it is an opportunity.

And it's great.
Opportunity.

Remember, this is on you.

Oh, and on a personal note,

thank you
for the graduation money.

It's my pleasure.

A kid my age can always
use an extra 50 bucks.

You know,

I kind of like this whole
"working for a living" thing.

It feels good, you know?

Responsible, grownup.

Absolutely.

All right, we have
successfully downloaded

40,000 hours of porn.

That's a lot to watch
two minutes at a time.

I just hope Billy
and Walden don't notice

that we're using
their hard drives.

Don't worry. I've labeled
every movie "personal."

Oh. Good thinking.

Oh, red light. I got it.

Nicely done.

We got this job nailed, my man.
Yeah.

And the best part is,

we are in on the ground floor
of the company.

(beeps)
Oh, another one.

Allow me.

Maybe they'll give us
stock options and we'll be rich.

What exactly is a stock option?

It's a call option on the
common stock of a company,

issued as a form
of cash compensation.

If the company stock rises,

the holder of the option

generally experiences
a direct financial benefit.

Where'd you learn that?

Wikipedia.
It's not just for term papers.

The point is,
we're gonna be rich.

(beeps)
Oh, another one.

Cool. So we'll have
our own planes

and yachts and chicks.

And tons of pot.
Chicks with pot.

Chicks with pot in bikinis.

Naked chicks with pot.

On a yacht.

I like that a lot.

Uh-oh.

That's not good.

Yeah. Why are they all
going bad at the same time?

I don't know.

It's like there's
some sort of virus.

Like the kind you get
when you download too much...

Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

Maybe we should call Billy!

No, we can do this!

Okay, we can't do this.

Call Billy!
Call Billy!

Hello?

Billy, it's Jake.

(hissing)

I just want to start once again

by saying how grateful we are
for this opportunity.

It's great.

How did this happen?

Oh, I... I don't know.

Well, faulty wiring
or, uh, cheap hardware...

Definitely not
a porn virus.

Shut up.

How could you guys do this?

I went out on a limb for you.

I believed in you.

Well, thank you.

It was... it was a
wonderful opportunity.

Oh, great opportunity.

So, when do we get paid?

(chuckles wryly)

Okay.

Yeah, you can't.
I know their parents.

Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

I thought your shift
didn't end till 8:00 a.m.

Well, we got done early.

Oh. Everything go okay?

I was kind of worried

you might burn the whole place
down or something.

Well, it wasn't "or something."

How am I supposed to find jobs
in the next 24 hours?

Beats me.

It's like our parents
are clueless

about how bad
the economy is.

Yeah.

You know what,

instead of working
for someone else,

we should start
our own business.

I like that.

We could find some
adventure capitalists

and become, um--
what do you call--

entrepraneers.

Yeah. It's not like we
don't have our own good idea.

We have great ideas.

Hey, maybe we can put other
food on a stick and sell it.

Yeah. Pizza on a stick.

Pizza sticks.

Pie.

Pie sticks.

Fish.

Yeah, what are we
going to call those?

Fish-sicles!

Genius!

Yeah.

MAN:
Excuse me.

Did I hear you guys say

you're looking for jobs?

Yeah.

Why?

Maybe it's me.

I'm an idiot magnet.

ALAN:
Hey.

Yup.

Hi.

How you doing?

Not so good.

Yeah, yeah, we heard,
and we're so, so sorry.

So, so very sorry.

Yeah, well, thank God
the files are backed up

and insurance will cover
most of the damage.

That's great news!

Yes. Phew!

(laughing)

You do realize that
your children are not normal.

Well, yeah, but, you know,
what's normal?

And-and in Jake's defense,

he never would have done
anything like this

unless, uh, you know.

(chuckling nervously)

"You know" what, Alan?

Well, I didn't want to,
you know, say anything

but, uh, but clearly there's
a bad influence involved here.

I mean, I don't want
to point any fingers,

but, uh, his name rhymes
with "smeldridge."

(Lyndsey scoffs)

Oh, my God.

You-you can't be serious.

My son had never been in trouble
in his life

until he met your son.

Never been in trouble?

He tried
to counterfeit money

with a computer
and an inkjet printer.

The government dropped
the charges.

Only because
there's no such thing

as a $25 bill.

LYNDSEY:
Yeah? Yeah? Well,

well, what about when Jake stole
your brother's Mercedes

and lost it in Topanga Canyon?

He didn't steal it.
He borrowed it.

And he was only driving it
because my brother was drunk

and someone had to take
his hooker home.

In Topanga Canyon,
which is where she lived.

You are always making excuses
for him.

And you don't excuse Eldridge?

LYNDSEY: Hey, he went through
a very rough divorce.

ALAN:
And Jake didn't?

LYNDSEY: Well, at least your
wife traded up.

Wh-what is that supposed
to mean?

Really?
That was too subtle for you?

Hey, everybody, good news.

You don't have to worry
about us finding work.

You-you got a job?

Yeah. It's not
just a job though.

It's an adventure.

What?

We're gonna be
all we can be.

Oh, oh, no-no, you didn't.

We didn't what?

Join the Army.

Yeah, we joined the Army.
How'd you know?

You need to listen to me.

They are not normal.

Uh, hiya.

Hi.

Looking for a new career?

Um, I'm 44 years old.

That's okay.

Today's Army is all-inclusive.

You can be as old and as gay
as you want.

Uh, well,
that's-that's good to know.

Um, uh, but I-I actually wanted
to talk to you

about my son, Jake Harper.

Harper. Harper.

Oh, yeah,
wants to be a drone pilot.

Yeah, he told me.

He thinks it's like
a video game.

Oh, it is.

It's exactly like a video game.

Except we blow up real people.

Yeah, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

Um,

I love my son,

uh, but more importantly,

I love my country,

uh, which is why
I don't think my son

should have access
to flying bombs.

Or really any kind of weapon.

I mean, between you and me,

I've seen him try to pick up
spilled food with a fork

and stab himself in the leg.

And not just once.

I understand your concern,
but our training is unsurpassed.

We take boys
and turn them into men.

I know you think that...

...but you don't know him
like I do.

He's 18, right?
Yeah.

Not currently on probation
or under indictment?

No.
Is this his signature?

Yeah.

Then if he passes the physical,

he's signed, stamped,
and off to camp.

I see.

Oh, look, al-Qaeda!

It's just a copy!

Hey, guys, you like video games?

Congratulations, Jake.

I know I'm only your stepdad,
but I'm real proud of you.

Thanks, Herb.
Were you ever in the Army?

Well, the KISS Army.

But I don't think
that really counts.

You think Mom's ever gonna
stop crying

before I go?

(sobbing quietly)

My guess is no.

Don't worry, Mom.

I'll be fine.

I'm a grown man now.

No, you're not.

You're my bigheaded baby.

(sobbing)

(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

So, Berta,
are you gonna miss me?

Nah, why should I miss you?

You're just an extra
toilet to clean.

That is, when you
hit the toilet.

(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll make you proud of me.

I've always been proud
of you, darling.

In my own way.

(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

Thanks for everything.

Come here.

(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

Look at
the bright side, Dad.

You won't have
to buy me clothes anymore.

They're gonna give me
a dress uniform,

a work uniform, and even one
for when I'm tired.

What?

Yeah, they call 'em "fatigues."

I don't know why they just
wouldn't call 'em pajamas.

Oh, my son, my son.

(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

You be a good boy,
and you do what you're told,

and promise me
you'll be careful.

Don't worry about me.

Worry about
our nation's enemies.

I am worried.

DRILL SERGEANT:
Come on, you lazy pukes!

Move it! Move it! Move it!

When do we start flying
the robot planes?

(grunting)

(straining):
I don't know.

Maybe after lunch.

No, we're going
on a five-mile run after lunch.

No, I'm gonna skip that.

I want to take a nap.

.......... ********** ..........

So to make a long story short...

...they say it's my fault for leaving the pistol
on the seat of the jeep.

I say it's the general's fault
for sitting on it.

But either way,
I'm not allowed to have a gun for a while.

And a weary nation
breathes a sigh of relief.

Yeah, terrific. Uh, so they've
got you working in the kitchen?

Yeah, we call it the mess.

That corn's not gonna
cream itself, Harper!

Uh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

Ah. Gotta go. Back to work defending
our nation against terrorists and whatnot.

Take care of yourself, buddy.

Don't worry, Dad.

I'm being all I can be.

Wow.

Yeah. Seems like just yesterday he was
an adorable, chubby-cheeked little boy...

...catching a Frisbee
on the beach in Santa Monica.

Now he's a fuzz-faced buck private
catching the clap from a whore in Tijuana.

Hey, guys. What do you think?

Oh, yummy.

You look like a maÃ®tre d' in heaven.

- What's the occasion?
- It's Zoey's birthday.

Oh. Say happy birthday.
What are you giving her?

The rest of my life.

- Beg your pardon?
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

- Hello.
- Are you serious?

Absolutely.

Wow. Wow. That's, uh...

- Um...
- What he's trying to say is:

Once you're married,
where's he gonna live?

No. Stop, please.

No, what I'm trying to say is,
I think it's wonderful...

...and I'm very happy for you.

I figured, "Why not?"

I mean, I love her, I love her daughter.

Yeah. It's win-win for everybody. Heh.

Gonna miss you.

Hey, I don't wanna get ahead of myself...

...but I hoped you'd be my best man.

Oh. Uh...

I'd be honored
to be the best man at your wedding.

- What's so funny?
- You wouldn't be the best man...

...at the Dinah Shore Golf Classic.

You can be the maid of honor.

- Okay, I gotta go.
- Good luck with Zoey.

Oh, thanks. But I mean...

...come on.

How about that? Kid's getting married.

Yeah. Crazy, huh?

If I looked like him,
I wouldn't take myself off the market.

Is that so?

Oh, yeah. I'd be out there every night
wearing my penis down to a nub.

It'd look like a golf pencil.

Hey, a golf pencil does
a lot of scoring, lady.

This is magnificent. Heh.

- As are you.
- Hmm.

Happy birthday.

Thank you.

Zoey...

...my life is so much better with you in it.

Aww... Heh.

The first time I saw you, it was like...

...fireworks.

- Did you do-?
- I did.

And when I hear your voice...

...it's like music.

Music.

Sorry.

God, Walden, all this for my birthday?

Not just for your birthday.

You see, Zoey...

...when a man loves a woman...

...he can't keep his mind on nothing else.

Okay, I'm totally lost now.

He'd give up all his comforts...

...and sleep out in the rain
if she said that's the way it ought to be.

- Wait, that's from some song.
- No, no, no. Not some song.

A great song.

Bolton, you're up.

When a man loves a woman

He can't keep his mind on nothing else

He'd trade the world

Get up, get up.

Stop it.

Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce.

If she's bad, he can't see it

Will you do me the honor of becoming...

...Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?

Turn his back on his best friend

If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman

Deep down in his soul

No, I'm sorry. I can't do it.

She can-

Zoey.

When a man loves a woman

Shut up, Bolton!

So after they get married,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Oh, Alan, don't be coy.

If you want to come live with me,
just ask.

- Can I come live with you? Heh.
- No.

Oh, come on, Mom,
I'm gonna be homeless.

Once he marries her,
I'll be on the street.

Try to pick a street in Beverly Hills
so I can visit you.

Does this guy belong to you?

Michael Bolton?

Hi, Alan.

Yes, bring him in.

What happened?

She said no.

Oh, Walden, I am so sorry.

Thank you.

Yeah, when I proposed,
she just ran out of the restaurant.

Now she won't return my calls
or e-mails or texts.

It's like she's ignoring me
across the entire digital spectrum.

It's like she's Amish.

So you went out drinking
and ended up picking up Michael Bolton?

No, I hired him to sing
while I was proposing.

I should have gone with Josh Groban.

Wait, you're gonna blame me for this?

I'm gonna call her again.

Oh, my stars.

Michael Bolton.

I have a vibrator named after you.

Zoey, why don't you answer?

Was it something I did?

Was the ring not big enough?

Was it Bolton?

Hey!

Okay.

Screw it, I'm not just gonna sit around here.
Come on, Bolton. Let's go find her.

I'm not gonna go looking for your girlfriend.
Why don't you see if Groban's available?

Hey, I bought and paid for your ass
until 10:00.

It's 10:01, so now you can kiss it.

Fine. I'll just drive myself.

Oh, no, no. Hang on, hang on.
You can't drive. I'll take you.

See, you're a good friend.

You're dead to me.

I can't believe the things I do for money.

You won't believe the things
I'll do for free.

I really think you ought to wait
until tomorrow to do this.

No. No.

- I need to know why.
- Not a good idea.

It's like asking a woman
why she won't sleep with you.

You always hope it's because you're too big
and you'll ruin her for other men.

But it's usually because she sobered up
and got a good look at you.

Oh... Walden. Ugh.

"Ugh. " That's the sound they make.

We need to talk.

Can we do this tomorrow?

Let me use a word that you're fond of:

No.

Have you been drinking?

Let me use a word that you're not fond of:

Yes.

- She's right. You can come back tomorrow.
- No.

I'm not leaving until I get an answer.

- Walden, please.
- Zoey, I need an answer.

Oh, it's complicated.

No.

Peeing with morning wood is complicated.

True. Heh. That thing is like a water wiggle.

Once, I shorted out
a light socket in the ceiling.

- I've done that.
- Yeah.

Saying yes to someone
who loves you more than life itself...

...is not complicated.

Fine. Do you really want to know?

- I really wanna know.
- Oh, hang on, hang on. Okay, okay.

This is an example
of what I was talking about.

When a woman says,
"Do you really want to know?"

You think you want to know,
but trust me, you don't.

No, I really wanna know.

There's someone else.

You're right. I did not wanna know.

It's someone I was involved with
many years ago.

And he's having a very, very rough time
and he needs me.

Oh.

Well, that clears it up.

Hey, if you like hanging out with guys
who are down on their luck...

...why don't you just shack up
with my loser friend?

- Um, I'm actually not available.
- Oh...

Wait a minute, there's another guy?

- Yep.
- Better than Walden?

- Apparently.
- I'm sorry.

Unless this new guy can fly around
the room and shoot fire out his ass...

...that bitch is crazy.

Hey.
- Well, hey.

Look who's finally up.
How you feeling, buddy?

A little hungover.

Berta, you got any pot brownies?

Until they cure glaucoma.

Thanks.

Want a glass of milk or something
to wash that down with?

No, I'm good. Thanks.

Um, instead of getting loaded,
maybe you wanna talk about it?

What is there to talk about, Alan?

She's with another guy.

No, I changed my mind about the milk.

I mean, how can another guy
give her anything that I can't give her?

Maybe he doesn't talk with his mouth full.

You know what?

I don't think another guy
can give her anything I can't.

- Well, you're probably right.
- Probably?

Definitely.

You know what?
Let's just make a list.

Okay, here we go. Look at this.

Walden. And the other guy.

Let's just call him Dick.

Okay. Ability to provide.

Walden, billionaire.

Dick? Less.

That's one point for me.

- Okay, looks.
- You win.

Thank you, Berta.

I didn't wanna say so myself.
Oh, there. Humility.

That's two more checks for me.

Okay. What else?
Oh, just all-around great guy.

Everybody likes me.

Who likes Dick?

- Um...
- Berta, please.

Oh, God.

Zoey likes Dick.

Who am I kidding?

Zoey loves Dick!

Oh. Hey, hey.

Take it easy.

I miss her, Alan.

Just the way she looks at me.

Her smile.

Sure, sure.

Her hair.

Her cute little butt.

Hello, sailor. Heh.

Just the way our bodies
just fit perfectly together.

Damn, I should have hugged him.

Trust me, buddy, a stranger in your bed is
not gonna chase away the memory of Zoey.

What do you suggest I do?

Well, what usually helps me
is a bottle of supermarket vodka...

...and masturbating
using my tears as lubricant.

So I'm just supposed to accept
being alone forever?

Hey, you will never be alone
because I will never leave you.

- Thanks.
- Can't get rid of me.

I'm like a dry cough.

You know, you might be onto something.

Maybe I should just give up women.

We should go gay.

Ha-ha. Good one. Heh.

No, I'm serious.

Really?

Okay, okay. If we're gonna do it,
we gotta do it right.

We'll get married in New Hampshire...

...uh, register at Pottery Barn,
adopt a Chinese baby.

Oh, we can wear scarves at our wedding.

- You would look great in a scarf.
- It hides the turkey neck.

We live together, we like each other,
we're halfway there.

Mailman already thinks we're gay.

Yeah, he does. I mean-

At night, we could sit out on the deck
and grill up a couple steaks.

Steaks? Who are we kidding? Seared ahi.

- Oh, better.
- Maybe some couscous?

- Oh, I love couscous.
- Yeah.

Yeah. Then after dinner,
we could go inside and watch the game.

- Or if the game's a blowout, Project Runway.
- Yeah.

Yeah. What do you think?

Mr. and Mr. Walden Schmidt.

So I would take your name?
Why wouldn't we take my name?

Because I'm the breadwinner.

So you think making a home isn't work?

I am sorry.

We'll hyphenate.

- Schmidt-Harper.
- Harper-Schmidt.

- Fine.
- I'll order the towels.

So listen, um...

...would we be, uh, having sex like guys do?

Oh, I would. You'd be having sex
more like a woman does.

Hmm.

- Problem?
- No, I'm open to it.

No pun intended.

But...?

Look, I'm willing to take one for the team.
It's just if this doesn't work out...

...I'd have to know
I'm gonna be provided for.

What is that supposed to mean?

It means I'm not signing a prenup.

Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

No, help yourself.

Thanks.

Forget what I said
about giving up women.

- Oh, yeah. I was just goofing.
- Hi. I'm Walden.

So close.

I told you I had a big backyard.

You didn't tell me it was so...

...wet.

Yeah, I gotta get my sprinklers checked.

This happens every day.

Whoa.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I think so.

No, I don't think so.

Are you as high as I am?

I'm pretty baked. Heh.

You're also pretty pretty.

Aww...

Mm.

Are you ready to get freaky?

I am way ahead of you.

Mm.

You must think I'm awfully easy.

No, I think you're wonderfully easy.

Uh-oh, here we go again.

I didn't expect anything like
this to happen...

...when I went to a bar alone
in a short skirt and no underwear.

Ah, jeez.

What's the matter?

Nothing. I'm-

I'm just coming out of a bad breakup
so I'm a little shaky.

That's okay.

I know how to make you forget her.

Uh-oh.

Still thinking about your girlfriend?

No. It's my ex-wife this time.

Okay.

Let's try again.

Oh.

Mm. Mm.

Mommy.

Mommy?

Okay.

Daddy.

No, keep, keep-
Can we just hold on for a second?

Am I doing something wrong?

No. No, I- Um...

I might just be a little too high.

Okay, let's slow it down.
I got nowhere to be.

Great.

I could kiss you all night long.

I could have made him scream like that.

I'm really sorry.

Me too.

I don't usually
mistake the women I'm sleeping with...

...for adult-contemporary pop artists.

That's new.

I need air.

All right, no pot for a while.

Oh, Walden.

It wasn't the pot.

Will you please just get out of my head?

Yelling's not gonna solve your problems,
Walden.

- Oh... Damn it.
- Women leaving, that's your problem.

Not right now, it isn't.

It was my fault, really.

Oh, great.

I was the first to abandon him.

Oh, you didn't abandon him.
You had a career.

Ha. Tell him that.

Would just-
Just all of you just leave me alone!

Go away, I tell you! Go away!

No way I'm signing a prenup.

Begone!

Just get out of my head!

Just leave me alone!

.......... ********** ..........

Good morning.

Top of the morning to you, sir.

Oh, God, did you have a stroke?

Oh, no, no stroke.
I'm bleaching my teeth.

- What?
- Hmm.

I'm bleaching my teeth.

Oh.

- What are you up to?
- Nothing. Just reading the news.

Mm. Me too. Old-school. Ha, ha.

Anything interesting over there?

Reading an article about how
home teeth-whitening systems...

...might cause mouth cancer.

- Really?
- No, of course not.

Why are you even bothering
with that thing?

I get rejected by women
for a hundred different reasons.

Whiter teeth would make it 99.

Zoey? Oh.

- Hi, Ava.
- Good morning, Walden.

What a great surprise.
What are you doing?

I wanted to invite you
to my birthday party.

That is so sweet.

Uh, I don't know if I can.

Why not?

Oh, boy. Uh, is your mom there?

She's taking a shower.

Maybe when she gets out,
you could ask if I can come.

Why? It's not her birthday.

Oh, this is breaking my heart.

Here's the thing, Ava.
I'm not your mom's boyfriend anymore.

I know that.
She's in the shower with Peter.

Kids say the darnedest things.

Okay, I'll tell you what, Ava, uh...

...you let me talk to your mom
and we'll figure something out.

Okay. I love you, Walden.

I love you too.

- Goodbye.
- Bye.

Damn it.

I can't believe
she's sleeping with this guy already.

Oh, we don't know that.

All we know
is they're in the shower together.

- You're not helping.
- Sorry.

Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.

A whiter smile.

I've got another tray. How about it?

- No.
- You sure? You know what they say:

A million-dollar smile
gathers a lot of interest.

Who says that?

It's the slogan on the box.

At least I think it is.
My Spanish is a little shaky.

I'll pass.

You sure?
Might take your mind off of Zoey.

- My mind is not on Zoey.
- Okay, fine.

You need to stop parking your car
in the garage.

- Oh, really? How come?
- It's leaking oil.

Oh, I don't think so.
I haven't put oil in it in two years.

- It's leaking something.
- Why don't I put down some cardboard?

- Why don't you just put it on the street?
- No, the salty sea air is very corrosive.

Hurt the Blue Book value.

Alan, you drive a 13-year-old
Volvo station wagon...

...with a quarter of a million miles on it.

The Blue Book has more value
than your car.

- Well, okay, but I-
- No buts!

You put your car on the street
or I'll put your ass on the street.

What a colossal douche.

What?
- Just moving my car, boss!

Hey.

Hey.

I want to apologize
for going off on you this morning.

No need.

- Really?
- Water under the bridge.

Which, coincidentally,
is where I had to park my car.

Well, I appreciate that.

And just FYI, pigeons nest under there.

My car already looks
like it's covered in mashed potatoes.

- I'll get it washed for you.
- It'll need detailing.

No problem.

And oil.

Sure.

We good?

Yeah, I suppose.

Now, show me that million-peso smile.

- Oh, no, I- You can't really tell.
- Oh, come on.

Wow.

- Nice. It's like a movie-star smile.
- Ah?

- You think?
- Yeah, they look like little Chiclets.

- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Mm.

Hey, I'm really sorry
about the whole car thing.

This breakup's got me a little crazy.

Oh. I understand.
When my wife left me, I had a lot of anger.

Of course, I internalized it...

...which led to a lot of hair in the sink
and blood in the toilet.

So you know what it's like to love someone
so much that your heart feels...

...like it's gonna explode from your chest
with pure happiness.

Oh, God, no, I was just pissed off
about losing the house.

My point is that everybody
has problems.

But what's important
is how you deal with them.

Here, let me get that for you.

See, the key is,
you gotta tap it in the right spot.

- It's not...
- Oh.

- It's okay. I got it.
- No, no. No, I got it.

What the hell?

- Son of a bitch!
- It's fine. Don't worry about it.

No, it's not!
I want ketchup and I can't have it!

- Calm down, it's just a condiment.
- Choose me, damn it. Choose me!

We're not talking about ketchup, are we?

What else would we be talking about?

Okay.

- Uh, here, let me help you clean that up.
- Oh, no, no, don't worry about it.

Here, give me your shirt and pants.
I'll throw them in the washer.

- That's not necessary, actually.
- Give me your shirt and pants.

Oh, don't wash the shirt with the pants...

...because it's off-brand
and the colors tend to run.

Oh, and wash the pants in cold water.

- Okay.
- They shrink in warm water.

Of course, that's funny,
because I shrink in cold water.

- Just give me your stupid clothes.
- Here, here.

Thank you.

I am so back in the garage.

Perfect.

Coming.

With any luck, it'll be
a door-to-door ketchup salesman.

Oh, Robin.

Hello, Alan.

Sorry. Come on in.

- Walden, your mom's here!
Be right there.

So nice to see you.

Well, it's nice to see so much of you.

Your son insisted I take off my clothes
after he soiled them.

That sounded weird, didn't it?

- So, what brings you by?
- Walden's taking me to lunch.

Oh, lovely.
I enjoy the occasional lunch with my mom.

- Really?
- As one enjoys the occasional colonoscopy.

Walden!

Sorry.

- Let's go. I'll drive.
ROBIN: Okay.

Oh. Bon appÃ©tit.

Bye.
- Bye.

Everything about that man is disturbing.

Nice to see you again.

Oh, look, the Yellow Pages.

Man.

Oh, boy.

- Um, Berta?
- Yeah?

I'm locked out.

Hang on.

Hurry up, I don't have any clothes on.

Hello?

Berta? Oh, come on!

This is nice. You and I haven't gone out
for a bite to eat in a long time.

Yeah.

It's a shame Zoey couldn't join us.

Mm-hm.

How's she doing?

- Fine.
- Good, I'm glad.

She's a great gal.
You don't wanna let that one get away.

Right.

How old is her daughter? Eight?

She's almost 9.

When's her birthday?

- Few days.
- Oh, fun. Is there gonna be a party?

Yeah.

You know, for one of your birthdays,
I got you a bouncy castle.

- Do you remember?
- I do.

- Get one of those for Zoey's daughter.
- That's a good idea.

Oh. And take lots of pictures. Those are
the moments you remember forever.

What-? What's happening?

We're out of gas. We just passed a station.
I'll be right back.

This is an electric car.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hey, weren't-?
Weren't you having lunch with your mom?

I was, but then she insisted
on taking an interest in my life.

That bitch.

- What are you working on?
- Oh, the NASDAQ presentation.

- I could use a hand.
- Sure. Send it over.

Okay, here it comes.

Oh, how'd the marriage proposal go?

- Went fine.
- How big of a rock you give her?

Pretty big.

Did she go under the table to thank you?

No, but you can.

Oh! Walden.

Dude. When's the big day?

- Don't know.
- What do you mean?

- I mean, we haven't set a date yet!
- Whoa, don't bite my head off, man, okay?

Wow.

- Oh, my God.
- What?

She shot you down, didn't she?

Can we just focus on the presentation?

No, we can't. Listen.

- Look, did she give you a reason?
- Billy.

- Was it-?
- Seriously, let it go.

Was it-? Was it that you were-?
You were too pretty or too rich?

Walden, Walden,
this proves that God exists.

And he's a short fat guy
that didn't get laid in high school.

Stop, please.

No, listen, listen, okay...

...first Bridget divorces you
and starts dating me.

And I mean, like... right?

Then... Then you get dumped
by Mary Poppins.

I mean, Walden, you've gotta wonder:

What is it about you
that drives women away?

- Billy, this is your last chance, dude.
- Okay, I'm changing the subject.

Changing the subject, okay?

I banged your ex-wife
in the shower this morning.

Go away!

Did you say, "Come in"?

What do you want, Alan?

Oh, I'm just checking in.

You know, you've been hiding out up here
for quite a few days now.

- Yeah. I'm busy.
- Oh.

I- I can see that.

So, what do you got here?
Is this Versailles or an Indian casino?

No, it's a dream house.
I'm gonna send it to Zoey...

...so she can see where we could've lived
if we would've gotten married.

Heh. Sure, that's not weird.

Um- Oh. Oh, you been smoking some pot?

No.

Oh. What a shame.
Would've explained a lot. Um...

Listen, buddy,
maybe it's time to take a break.

No, I gotta finish the roof
before the rainy season.

Oh. There's weather in Legoland. Um...

Oh, oh. By the way,
I bought you your own tooth-whitening kit.

You know, in case you ever
feel like smiling again.

"As seen on Telemundo."

- Put it in the Zoey room.
- What?

- The Zoey room.
- Oh.

Alrighty. Heh.

Oh, boy.

You can almost see
the yellow police tape.

On the plus side, my teeth look fantastic.

Thank you all for coming.
I know you're all as concerned...

- ...about Walden as I am.
- You know what I'm concerned about?

I'm concerned with the tooth
he knocked out of my head, all right?

I smoked crack for three and a half years,
I didn't lose tooth one.

Then golden boy gets dumped, I look
like a extra on Hillbilly Handfishin', eh?

I'd just like to point out that Walden
is not the first rich and handsome guy...

...to snap his bean up in that room.

Thank you, Berta.

I'm just saying
maybe the house is haunted.

Maybe it's plagued by a negative entity
who just won't leave.

Hey, you're not gonna hang this on me.

It's my hope that if we share
our concerns with Walden...

...with a unified voice,
we might be able to get through.

- Like an intervention?
- Oh, those suck.

They're like-
They're like judgmental surprise parties.

They're like, "Surprise! You're a loser!"

I don't need an intervention.

- I'm fine.
- Sweetie, we're worried about you.

Well, you don't have to worry anymore.
I'm done with Zoey.

Please tell me that's not her in the bag.

No, it's the Legos!
And the- And the pictures.

Oh, good. Heh.

Yeah, I- This breakup
hit me a lot harder than I thought.

Well, anyway, I want to apologize
for the way that I've been acting.

- Uh, I think I went a little off the rails.
- A little?

I had perfect teeth.

Oh. I just whitened mine.

Yeah, now you're good-looking.

Anyway, I appreciate you all
being worried about me.

But I- I really think
I've turned the corner.

God, what is with that dog?

Honey, don't worry about the dog.
You were saying?

Yes, I was saying
that lately I've been really sad.

And I didn't know how to deal with it,
so I got angry.

But I think now I know how
to process those feelings, so I...

Damn it!

ROBIN:
Walden!

Oh, God, what has he done?

Sounds like he killed a dog?

Okay, problem solved.

You stole a dog?

No, I bought him. He's real smart.
Watch this:

Sit.

Sit.

Sit.

Okay, stand up.

What a good dog.

- Hey.
- Whoa, that is a big bag of dog food.

He's a big bag of dog.

- You sure taking on a pet is a good idea?
- I think it'll help me a lot.

You know, just unconditional love
from an animal that'll never leave me.

Thought that's what I was for, but okay.

Check it out, I got him a chew toy,
with big white teeth just like yours.

Yeah, that is cute.

Come here. Let me show you
something else that's cute.

I might wanna get a trainer.

Way ahead of you.

I got a number for you to call.

What did I do with my phone?

Oh, here.
Why don't I call you so you can find it?

You're number one
on my speed-dial, by the way.

Wonder how many bars he gets in there.

Oh, Walden, you came to my party.

I did. And I brought you a present.

- Oh, boy. Is he mine?
- He sure is.

Oh, thank you, what's his name?

He doesn't have one. It's up to you.
You can name him whatever you want.

I'm gonna call him Walden.

That's perfect.

What's going on? Walden?

Look, Mommy, Walden got me
a dog for my birthday.

What?

I love you, Walden.

You're gonna be hearing that a lot.

- Happy birthday, Ava.
- Wait, wait, Walden, come back here.

I can't. I wasn't invited.

Uh-oh. Walden took a big poop.

Oh, hey. How you doing?

I've never felt better in my whole life.

Good. You think you got the whole
Zoey thing in your rearview mirror?

- I do.
- Attaboy.

Hey, where's Dogzilla?

What?

Did you whiten your teeth?

Nope. I did a bad, bad thing.

Oh, no, not my Louboutins.

Ugh.

Walden is taking
this stupid bloody dog back.

.......... ********** ..........

Are you happy?

I was before you ate that last garlic knot.

I'm serious.

Hasn't our relationship
become a bit...

- Predictable.
- Predictable. Yes.

Why do you ask?

I was thinking that maybe
we could spice things up a little.

What'd you have in mind?

Well, um...

I have been reading Fifty Shades of Grey.

Oh.

And I have some silk scarves
and, uh, some duct tape.

Do you see this taking place in a bedroom
or the back of a panel van?

I don't know,
I'm only halfway through the book.

Forget the book.

What about you?

- Do you have any fantasies?
- Of course I do.

If I lived only in my regular life,
I'd eat a rifle.

Tell me one.

I guess I always wanted to
take some naughty pictures of you, ha-ha-ha.

We could do that.

- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

There's already a lot
available online.

What else?

Oh, well, I guess it's a clichÃ© for a guy...

...but, um, I've always wanted
to have a threesome.

Okay.

- I know it's silly.
- No, I mean, okay. We can do it.

If you're messing with me,
I will never forgive you.

I'm not messing with you.

Seriously?
We can have a threesome?

Come on. You'd do the same for me.

- Of course I would.
- Good...

- ...because I have a fantasy of my own.
- Lay it on me, baby.

I want to have a threesome also.

See, see? This is why communication
is so important in a relationship.

Two minutes ago I didn't care
if you lived or died.

Now I love you more than any man
has ever loved a woman.

You complete me. But add another chick
and I'll complete myself.

Great.

What's your pleasure, treasure?
Blond, brunette?

Someone with a little junk in the trunk?

Nope.

- In my threesome, there's you...
- Mm-hm.

...me and another guy.

- Another guy?
- Yep.

Boy, I don't know.

Um...

I never thought about it that way, ha-ha-ha.

Four balls, two bats and one mitt.

Could be fun.

Yeah, but, uh, who would the other guy
even be?

Hey.

Oh, crap.

So you want to have a threesome
with me and Walden?

You have your fantasy,
I have mine.

Yeah, but mine's a traditional,
wholesome three-way.

You, me and an anonymous, drunken slut.
The way God intended.

Walden is a friend.
Plus, we see him all the time.

- So?
- So it'll be awkward.

Not for me.

It's not a good time.

He just broke up with Zoey,
and he's very vulnerable right now.

I think this would help.
He needs to get back on the horse.

And in this case-

So do we have a deal?

All right. After we have mine,
we approach Walden-

- No, no, no. I go first.
- Why?

Speaking from experience, once you
get yours, I'll never get mine.

I am offended...

...that you would insinuate that
I would break a sacred trust.

I love you, Lyndsey,
and if you can't believe in me...

...then we have bigger problems
in our relationship...

...than whose dirty, nasty hump-fest
we have first.

Take it or leave it.

Take it.

Oh, I plan to.

Gorgeous day, isn't it?

I wonder what the poor people are doing?

One of them is asking me
what the poor people are doing.

Rich, good-looking and funny.

God certainly gave with three hands.

Hey, speaking of three hands...

...there's, uh, something I need to ask you.

Sure.

Oh, boy, where do I start?

Okay, here's the deal:

Things with Lyndsey and me
have gotten a little stale, sexually speaking.

Everything's by the numbers.

I get it, you're skipping right from
68 to 70.

Exactly. Exactly.

Anywho, ahh,
we've come up with a solution.

- What's up?
- We're going to have a threesome.

Really?

- She agreed to that?
- Yep.

Dude, way to go.

Yeah, yeah, it's great.

The thing is, Lyndsey wants to have
a sausage fest before the clam bake.

That's clever.

Yeah, she has this crazy idea
that before I have my threesome...

...she wants to have one of her own.

Wait. She wants to have
a threesome without you?

No, no, I'm gonna be there.
Uh, but with another guy.

- Huh.
- Ha, the really crazy part is...

...um, uh...

...that she wants the other guy,
uh, to be, um, you.

- Okay.
- Yeah, no, I told her that there was no way-

No, no, I'm in.

What? You're in?

Yeah, sure. It sounds like fun.

Zoey and I aren't together.
I don't see any reason why...

...I shouldn't be doing my own thing.
And Lyndsey's own thing.

Probably not your own thing.

Well, are you sure?

Why not? It's time to shake things up...

...get out of my comfort zone, you know,
maybe slip into your comfort zone.

- Get it?
- Yeah.

I got it.

Well, I guess I should let Lyndsey know.
Ha, ha.

She'll be thrilled.

As am I.

Yay.

Hey, wait.

- You want to do this, right?
- Absolutely.

I'm very open-minded
about sexual matters.

After all, I did grow up
during the sexual revolution.

Well, technically a few years after...

...but there were still condoms
and diaphragms laying all over the place.

Oh, and, uh, just a heads up. Um...

Exit only.

Nope, not even a thumb.

I am so happy you said yes.

I am honored you asked.

Oh! Aren't you adorable?

Not as adorable as you.

Yeah, we're all adorable.

Listen, we need to establish some
ground rules.

Sure, like what?

Well, for instance, there are
a few things I happen to know...

...Lyndsey's not exactly fond of doing.

Nope, I'm good.

Really? You're good?

With everything?

Even the Philadelphia Dump Truck?

Back it up.

Beep, beep, beep, beep.

Anything else?

Well, I guess this goes without saying...

...but we're not making Band-Aids here...

...so Johnson
should never meet Johnson.

Yeah, true.

Two dongs don't make a right.

Oh, speaking of.

If you have any desire to stick your
tongue in my mouth...

...stick your tongue in her mouth
and then she'll stick her tongue...

...in my mouth,
and we'll consider the circle complete.

Fine. It's your loss.

I would like to propose a toast.

Friends may come and friends may go.

Friends may peter out, you know.

But here's to us through thick and thin,
peter out and peter in.

Hear, hear.

Cheers.

So, what do you say?
Let's get these balls rolling.

This is okay, what we're doing, right?
We're all consenting adults.

Oh yeah, sure. Sure.

I mean, if one of us was mentally impaired,
then the consent might be suspect.

True. If you were required to wear
a helmet...

...or have a service dog...

...that might be construed
as taking advantage.

Yeah. But everybody here
knows what they're getting into.

Yeah, nobody's taking their pants off
for a candy bar.

Or absolution.

Um, so listen, uh...

Don't feel obligated to bring
your A game today, okay?

My A game?

I mean, what I'm saying is you're
younger than I am, prettier than I am...

...there's more...

...of you than there is of me.

What do you want me to do?

Just saying,
we're playing a public course here.

Spot me a couple strokes.

You just be the maypole, let her
run around with the ribbons.

No, no, that is not my style.

I'm very aggressive.

I'm in it to win it.

What do you think, boys?

I am definitely gonna win it.

Oh, yeah, well, we'll see about that.

- You do look beautiful, darling.
- Yeah, thanks.

This is probably bad to say...

...but Zoey had an outfit like that
she used to wear all the time.

Well, not all the time,
just when we were having sex.

- Which was pretty much all the time.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

Oh, I guess we're starting. Uh...

You know, I not only loved Zoey,
I also loved her daughter.

That is beautiful.

- Kind of thought we were gonna be family.
- We're your family now.

I'm starting to feel
a little like a very distant cousin.

I miss her so much.

I'd have given odds
that I'd be the one crying.

Walden, you doing okay in there?

I'm okay, I just need a minute.

Maybe this just isn't meant to be.

- Why not?
- The man is clearly upset.

Oh, boo-hoo.

- I'm really sorry.
- No need to apologize.

In fact, if it would help, you can
close your eyes and pretend I'm Zoey.

- Really?
- Of course.

- Um, should I pretend you're somebody else?
- Do whatever you want.

That's a good idea.
Let's try that.

Attaboy.

Oh, Zoey.

Oh, Walden,
give us a good shagging, won't you?

I can't. I can't do this.

- "Give us a good shagging, won't you?"
- What? That's a thing.

Doesn't matter. Let's make sure
we don't get a crybaby for my threesome.

Your threesome?
We haven't even had mine yet.

Oh, I beg to differ.

I held up my part of the bargain.

If I serve pie and nobody's hungry,
it still counts as dessert.

I suppose.

Now what?

Not that you care, but I did take a
lethal dose of boner pills before we started.

- Is that so?
- I'm either gonna have sex or a stroke.

Your call.

Come on, let's go to your bedroom.

- Really?
- I'd rather take care of you for 20 minutes...

...than the next 20 years.

That's the spirit.

It's a beautiful day.

Why don't you go down to the beach
and find some kids to play with?

Don't wanna.

Okay. Why don't you go ride your bike?

Don't feel like it.

Well, you can't sit in the house all day
staring at that computer.

I made a billion dollars doing this.

Carry on.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Great to see you. What's up?

Well, I got a most interesting
phone call this morning.

From Lyndsey.

Alan's Lyndsey?
The one with the drinking problem?

The very same.

Ha, what did she want?

She wanted to tell me, in no particular order,
that you're a great guy...

...that you are still very much in love with me
and that I'm a complete idiot...

...for breaking up with you.

I am, I am, you are.

- You didn't put her up to that call, did you?
- No.

- Not at all.
I do miss you.

And it's very hard for me too.

I was kind of hoping that you'd say that.

So do you think maybe-?

You, sir, can make out
with my girlfriend any time you want.

You got her so worked up,
she humped my brains out.

So where were we?
I miss you, you miss me...

Ow! What did I do?

Ow!

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,
this is like Christmas morning!

But instead of celebrating the birth of our Lord,
little Alan is gonna get some strange.

I know you're excited,
but the first step is selecting the right girl.

- Hey, what about that blond over there?
- Eh, I guess.

- What's wrong with her?
- Her outfit's a little matchy-matchy, isn't it?

The outfit's gonna be on the floor.

Still, it says something
about her lack of imagination.

Fine.

- How about the redhead?
- Oh, redheads.

They do dirty things.

- So should we approach her?
- No, no, hang on.

She's got a tramp stamp.

- So?
- It's a little skanky, isn't it?

We're trying to invite her to a threesome.

- Skanky is good.
- You're right, you're right.

Although, she does have cankles.

Skanky Cankles.

Isn't that what they call
Santa Claus in Norway?

- Are you done?
- Sorry.

Just a case of the pre-menage jitters.

You do realize if I wasn't here,
you couldn't get any of these women?

I'm not so sure.
I still have a few moves up my sleeve.

Really? Be my guest.

Fine, watch this.

- Hello.
- No.

I'm good with whoever you pick.

I'm confused.

The only reason you're doing this is
because it's your husband's fantasy?

Ex-husband.

Ah.

Wow, what a view.

- The view from here is pretty good too.
- It certainly is.

I'm gonna end up watching
from the sidelines again, aren't I?

You're lucky you even get to watch.

Wow, you two look really lovely.

You could actually be sisters.

That is exactly wrong.

I meant sisters,
like, uh, sisters doing it for themselves.

What's the deal? Is he dying
and this is on his bucket list?

It's complicated.
Just stay focused on me.

- So shall we get this party started?
- Great.

- Is there somewhere I can freshen up?
- Sure, the bathroom's down the hall.

Okay. Be right back.

So how are we slicing up this pie?

- What?
- You know, who gets what when?

Or are we gonna take shifts
and tap each other out like wrestlers?

- Nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.

So how do you know Lyndsey
and the old guy?

Oh, Alan.
He lives here. This is my house.

- No kidding.
- Mm-hm.

Oh, oh, and one more thing.
If I yell "cheeseburger"...

...it means I'm close, and you need to
whack me on the head...

- ...because I want this to last.
- You are so cute.

- I love you.
- I love you too.

Oh, no. No.

Oh, man, I just cannot catch a break.

She sounds fun.

So does he.

You know, if we close our eyes
and don't say anything...

Way ahead of you, Walden.

Cheeseburger.

.......... ********** ..........

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

I just can't remember
what I came down here for.

Oh.

That happens to me all the time.

I- I can't remember a specific example,
but yeah.

Yeah, that's annoying.
Maybe you were hungry.

- Did you come to get something to eat?
- No, I just ate.

- Were you gonna watch TV?
- No, I have a TV in my room.

This is very disconcerting.

Don't panic. We'll figure this out. Did you
come down to give me the money you owe me?

Eh.

It was worth a shot.

No, I was upstairs and I thought to myself,
"I need to come downstairs and..."

You know what might help?

A little less, "Whoa, dude,
where's my car?"

No, it's not the pot.
I've been smoking pot since...

It's- It's not the pot.

God, what did I come down here for?

- Walden!
- Hey!

I remember now. We have a houseguest.

Thank you so much
for sending that car for me.

I felt like a big old movie star
at the airport.

The driver held a sign with my name,
carried my bags...

...and even gave me a bottle of water
from Fiji.

- It probably wasn't from-
- Would you look at this house?

I mean, right here on the ocean.

This is like something you would see in
a magazine, except there'd be famous people.

- It is so nice to see you.
- Well, it is nice to see you too.

- Let me- Missi, let me introduce my friend-
- Hi, I'm Missi.

Everyone thinks it's short for Melissa,
but it's for Mississippi. The river.

I was conceived on the deck
of a gambling boat...

...when my daddy won $5000 jackpot
on the Caribbean poker.

- Wow, that's-
- Been to the Caribbean?

I went there three years ago
for spring break and got stung by a jellyfish.

My friend had to pee on my leg.

Alan.

- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

Could you direct me to the girls' room?

I mean, unless one of y'all
have recently been stung by a jellyfish.

- It's right here.
- Thank you.

Wow. She's a pistol.

More like an AK-47.

So, what's the-? What's the story here?

You and her?

No, she's my old friend Jerry's daughter.
She's thinking about moving here.

I told him she could stay here a couple days
and I'd show her around.

Hm. She's very pretty.

Yeah.

How old do you think she is?

- Like 18 or 19.
- Oh, perfect.

You might lose a friend,
but you won't go to jail.

Ow! Hey, hey, hey.
Don't hit me because you can't hit that.

Ow!

Oh, my God.
The weather here is amazing.

I could just lay out in the sun
all day just like a big old lizard.

Back home, I get a spray tan, but it comes
out orange, which is fine during Halloween.

- I can say I'm going as a pumpkin.
- Oh, that's-

I love Halloween. Last year,
I went to this party as a slutty nurse.

The year before that, I was a slutty cat,
and before that, I was a ladybug.

- A slutty ladybug?
- What? No.

Why would I be a slutty ladybug?

- Oh. I just-
- So...

- What's the deal with this Alan guy?
- Oh, we-

Y'all gay for each other?
I mean, it's totally fine if you are.

I have a gay friend. Name is Russell.
Got him to make out with me. It didn't take.

No, we- We are not gay.

We are definitely not gay.

Uh...

So your dad tells me you're thinking
about relocating.

Well, to be honest,
I'm not sure what I wanna do.

I could keep working
as a dental assistant.

That person that sucks the spit out
of your mouth?

- Yes.
- And gives you a toothbrush and a lollipop?

You do know what the lollipop's for, right?

- Well, I'm assuming-
- Repeat business.

If it were up to me, I'd just give them
caramel apple or a little taffy.

Pull their teeth right out of their heads.
That's how you make money off children.

Well, that and baby beauty pageants.

Right.

- So, I mean, there's a lot-
- Do you have a girlfriend?

No, I do not.
I just went through a breakup.

Oh, you poor baby. I am so sorry.

Could you put some suntan lotion
on my back?

Uh, sure.

Well, don't forget to rub-a-dub-dub.

- Rub-a-dub-dub?
- Yeah, you gotta rub it in.

Oh. Yeah, okay.

- Be offended if I popped the girls out?
- What?

You know, get a little color
on Kim and KhloÃ©?

Oh, yeah, go ahead.

- Where you going?
- I just need to do this thing...

...that I need to do.

Heh. Okay. You take care.

MISSI: I had an electric car too when I was little.
You know, one of those Barbie Jeeps?

Uh-huh.

But this one time, I left it out in the rain,
so the battery died.

So my dad had to drill two little holes
so I could stick my feet through...

- ...and pedal it just like Fred Flintstone.
Yabba-dabba-doo.

- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you guys been?

- Uh, we-
- Walden took me to Santa Monica Pier.

I actually got one of those churros.
It's like a doughnut, but long and Mexican?

Oh, hey, I'm Missi.
Are you Alan's girlfriend?

- Hell, no!
- No!

- No, Berta is my housekeeper.
- Oh, cool. When I was in high school...

...I used to clean rooms at the Howard
Johnson Hotel. People are disgusting.

I walked into a bathroom one time,
and it looked like a cow had exploded.

Excuse me,
that churro's heading back to the border.

That, my friends, is what you get...

...when hillbillies have unprotected sex
with hummingbirds.

No, no trouble at all, Jerry.

She's a great kid. Takes after her old man.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh, hey, Jerry, I'm getting another call. I got-
Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

You know, I love you dearly, Jerry,
but you gotta shut up.

Okay, I'll talk to you, buddy.

Yeah?

- Hi.
- Hey, I just got off the phone with your dad.

- He was just calling-
- That man can talk.

I swear, he doesn't even pause
to take a breath. Do you have a sec?

Sure.

Okay, yeah, have a seat.

Wow. This is a nice bed.

I bet you could do some serious drilling
on a workbench like this, huh?

Yeah. You said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

Do you remember the last time
that we saw each other?

- Dinner?
- No, silly.

I'm talking about
when I was 8 years old...

...and you came to visit
and we went to the state fair.

- Okay, I remember that.
- You had to take me and my mom...

...because my dad was working?
We ate cotton candy.

Then you won me that little stuffed pig
in the squirt-gun horse race?

I used to practice my kissing on him.

Lucky pig.

I wore out all the terry cloth on his snout.

It was okay. By that time,
I'd changed over to real boys...

...which, turns out,
a couple of them were pigs too.

Yeah, pigs.

Do you want a robe or a blanket
or a suit of armor?

Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.

Remember I wanted to go on the tilt-a-whirl,
but my mom was scared?

You said you'd sit next to her. I wanted you
next to me. So you sat in between us.

You were the one that got scared
and started praying:

"Oh, Lord, please get me off this ride!"
I think you even tinkled a little bit.

Wow, that's a good memory.

I remember because it was one
of the best days ever.

Aw.

Are you lonely?

You know, I got Alan.

Yeah, but Alan doesn't keep you warm
at night.

You'd be surprised.

Listen, um...

I have this idea.

You know, you might think
that it's kind of crazy.

- Okay.
- I was just thinking, you know...

...since you're single and you're super hot
and a really nice guy.

Yeah.

That, you know, maybe you'd like
to hook up with my mom.

- What?
- She's been all alone...

...since my daddy ran off
with that lady from the dry cleaners.

The one with that weird eye
that won't quite open.

Probably from all them fumes.
We should've seen it coming.

She gave him all the clothes that nobody
claimed. He had, like, four tuxedos.

Wait, wait. You wanna set me up
with your mom?

She always had a thing for you.
She would kill me if I told you.

- Okay, Missi, I don't think that's a good i-
- Just think about it, okay?

- Okay.
- Great.

Oh, and if it helps at all,
she just got her boobs done.

They used mine as a model. The doctor
put them in his catalog. Number 244.

Anyone can get them.
But it's kind of weird.

When I walk around town,
I keep thinking I see my boobs.

Good night.

Her mom?

When did I become the guy
that the hot 19-year-old looks at and goes:

"Hey, you'd be great for my mom"?

Count your blessings.
One of my patients tried to set me up...

- ...with her 70-year-old grandmother.
- No.

Yeah, yeah. We dated for three months,
and then...

...one day, I showed up
and she couldn't remember who I was.

So we dated another two months.

And every day was new again until finally
I got tired of introducing myself.

Oh. But then, six months later, she sent me
a $10 check on my birthday.

Hello?

Jake?

Hey, man.
- What are you doing here?

I got a weekend pass,
so I took a train to surprise you.

Hi, soldier.

- Hello.
- You must be Jake.

I'm sleeping in your room.

God bless America.

It is so nice to meet you. I'm Missi.

Short for Mississippi, not Melissa.
She got stung by a jellyfish and peed on.

Thank you.

Are you one of those Navy SEAL guys?
They are so awesome.

- No, I'm just a cook.
- Well, that's cool too.

Without food, everybody dies.

- That's-
- One time, I found this bird that fell...

...in my backyard,
and he was almost dead.

I started feeding him with
this eyedropper of milk.

"Eat little bird, eat little bird."
And eat he did.

I was chewing up crackers
and spitting them in his mouth.

When he had enough strength to fly,
I opened up that box and set him free.

- No kidding-
- It was one of the most beautiful things.

But he got about 10 feet up in the air...

...before my cat launched himself
off that table and caught him.

He didn't have to chew.
One gulp and that bird was gone.

But I didn't have
to feed Mr. Mittens that day.

So I know how important food is.

- Thanks. If you're hungry, I could-
- I would love something to eat.

Oh. Okay.

All right, well, welcome back.

Good catching up.

That was like being there
the first time Beavis met Butt-Head.

Wait till Beavis sees Butt-Head in a bikini.

Do you remember falling
that hard and fast for a girl?

I remember the fast part.

Kind of a relief those days are behind us,
huh?

Behind you.

These are my days.

- Oh, no, I wasn't saying that-
- No, I am young, Alan.

- I am young.
- Fine, fine, you're young.

Where you going?

I don't remember.

Mmm. Kid makes good chili.

Glad you like it.
We have enough for a month.

Why?

The recipe was for a platoon
and math is not his strong suit.

Where'd he take:

"This place is beautiful.
Does that ocean go to Hawaii? I love Hawaii.

You know aloha means hello
and goodbye?"

They went for a walk on the beach.

"Which has more grains
of sand than there are stars in the Milky Way.

Speaking of which, do you like Snickers
or Milky Way? I like 3 Musketeers.

Even though I don't know
what nougat is."

- Hey, what you doing?
- Missi and I are hanging out.

Am I gonna see you at all while you're home?

Yeah, sure.

You're never gonna see him.

Missi told me she's trying
to set you up with her mom.

How cool would that be?

If you married her mom
and I married Missi, you'd be my stepdad.

Yeah, really cool.

All right, see you later, Dad.

And Dad.

You know, if they have kids,
we'd be their grandpappies. Ow!

Well, to make a long story short,
I ate all the wafers.

Which is why you should never smoke pot
before church.

- That's funny. This one time, me and my-
- Do you want to hear a joke?

- Sure.
- What do gay horses eat?

- What?
- Hay!

Can I ask you something?

Do you think I talk too much?

No, I love listening to you talk.
I mean, it's funny, normally-

You are just so sweet.
I swear, I could just eat you up.

But then I'd get a sugar rush,
because you are just so sweet.

And if you think I talk a lot now,
you should really hear me after I-

Well, I am definitely gonna shut up now,
because you're a really good kisser-

Look at you making breakfast.

That's what the Army trains you to do
when you keep dropping a loaded gun.

- Here, have a cup of coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

- You wanna hear a joke?
- Sure.

What do gay horses eat?

Hay.

So when do you leave for the base?

Oh. My train leaves at 4.

- I'll give you a ride to the station.
- Thanks.

You kidding? It's the only time
I'm gonna spend with you.

So how was sleeping on that couch
last night?

Oh. You know, it was a little lumpy...

...but better than sleeping
with 60 guys coughing, farting...

...getting all romantic with themselves.

- Missi still sleeping?
- No, she's in the shower.

Oops.

No, it's fine. She seems like a nice girl.

You have no idea.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take her some breakfast.

As you can imagine,
we worked up quite the appetite.

Right.

And when I say, "Worked up an appetite,"
you understand-

I got it, I got it.

I really loved hanging out with you
this weekend.

Cool.

Uh, yeah. So listen,
I get another pass in, like, a month.

- So maybe we can see each other then.
- Maybe.

Are you feeling all right?
You're awful quiet.

Well, here's the thing, Jake.

Hang on, Dad, there's a thing.

What's the thing?

I sort of have a boyfriend.

- A boyfriend?
- Well, technically, we broke up.

I was tired of him
putting his career ahead of me.

He's a doctor.
Well, not a real doctor, a glass doctor.

If you get a crack in your windshield,
he will come and fix it...

- ...in less than half an hour guaranteed.
- So-

He sent me this e-mail this morning
saying that he wants to try things again.

But now I really like you.

It's just that Zach and I have been together
for, like, six months.

And we even went to a wedding together.
I can't just throw that away.

But I thought you-

Goodbye, Jake.

Don't be a hero.

What the hell just happened?

You and Missi make plans
to see each other again?

No.

- Why? I thought you two were-
- I thought so too.

Oh.

- If it helps-
- It doesn't.

Okay.

- I remember my first-
- Dad.

Gotcha.

- Does it get any easier?
- Oh, God, no.

But the human mind is a wonderful thing.

It forgets pain, so you can go out
and get some more.

She has a boyfriend back home. A doctor.

How am I supposed to compete with that?

Let me ask you something, Jake.

Knowing what you know now,
and feeling how you feel now...

...would you have done anything
differently?

No.

I just would have done it
a few more times.

There you go.

That's what love's all about.

Hey. So I just got off the phone
with my mom.

- Oh, yeah?
- She's really looking forward...

...to hearing from you.

Gee, I don't know, Missi.

I'm- I'm not sure it's a good idea.

I mean, I know your mom and dad
aren't together anymore...

- ...but your dad's an old friend and-
- Here's a recent picture of her.

- Then again, I haven't seen him in years.
- Great. I'll go tell her that you're gonna call.

- Okay. Oh, hey, wait. Wait a second. I-
- Yeah?

I'm flattered that you think I'd be good
for your mom.

But I was just curious.

At any point in time,
did you think that maybe you and me...?

Ew.

A simple no would suffice.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men.

Zoey, will you do me the honor...

...of becoming
Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?

No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

- I need an answer.
- There's someone else.

I like that red dress on you.
I feel like a bull. I wanna charge.

Speaking of charging,
did you bring your wallet this time?

The last two times were honest mistakes.

And I fully intend to pay you back.

Oh, that's just great, Justin.

If your mom says it's bath-time,
by all means, take a bath.

Meanwhile, the free world
is falling into the hands of cyber-terrorists.

- You okay?
- Yeah.

My sniper's gotta get ready
for sixth grade picture day tomorrow.

- You guys look nice.
- Thanks. We're going out to dinner.

- Wanna join us?
- No, I got a burrito in the microwave.

Okay, enjoy.

Oh, you did take the foil off of the...

I'll get my coat.

- Isn't that your wallet?
- Oh, uh...

Yes. That's, uh, uh...
I put it there, so I wouldn't forget it.

I'm really glad we did this.

I've been playing with kids
I met on the Internet for too long.

Now that I say that out loud,
I'm really glad we did this.

Hmm. I'll get this.

I'll get it.

Oh, okay...

- ...I guess I'm really gonna get this.
- Thanks, Alan.

Oh, it's my pleasure. Ahem.

- Are you crying?
- What? No, no. I have allergies.

It's probably the dust
from opening his wallet.

- Damn it.
- What?

It's Zoey and her new boyfriend.

- I am so sorry.
- This is tough. After what she did to you.

Come on. Let's just get this over with.

He didn't deserve it.
He gave her everything.

And he actually has things to give.

Hi, Zoey.

Walden, hi.

- Lyndsey.
- Hi.

- Alan.
- Pssh.

Um- This is my friend Peter.

Peter.

- Nice to meet you.
- Cheers, mate.

"Cheers, mate.
We hosted the Olympics."

This is a bit awkward.

Why is this awkward?

Yes, that's right, I remember.
Because you ruined my best friend's life.

I'm sorry, nice to meet you.

What you did
was wanton and reprehensible.

Keep moving.
- Jezebel.

If it makes you feel any better,
he didn't like you before.

- How you doing? You okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

- I mean, my heart's racing and-
- I was talking to Walden.

Yeah, I guess. I thought
seeing her with somebody else...

...would be the end of the world,
but I'm really okay with it.

- You're a better man than I am.
- We all know that, Alan.

I'm saying it wasn't
as bad as I thought it would be.

I mean, clearly,
Alan has some unresolved issues.

But I think I'm ready to move on.

- I can definitely help you there.
- Where are you going with this, sweetie?

I have a ton of friends
who would die to go out with you.

- Really?
- Oh, yeah-

That's true. She has some
of the hottest friends you can imagine. Ahem.

That you can imagine, not that I would.
I mean, why would I?

You're the hottest of them all, you know?
Tsst.

So, what's your type?

I don't know if I have a type.
I like brunettes.

But I married a redhead.
And I've dated some blondes.

So I guess
what I'm saying is I'm pro-hair.

In the upper deck,
not necessarily around the dugout.

Ah. Interesting. If you're gonna go
with a baseball reference...

...I would've gone with "on the mound."

They all have hair
in the appropriate places. What else?

I don't know, I like a girl who's smart.
I like a girl who's funny.

I like a girl who's not gonna leave me
for another guy.

Oh, oh. No one who wears those
big furry boots with shorts or mini-skirts.

You're either hot or you're cold.
Take a stand, ladies.

I'll take care of it.

So, Walden, as I told you,
Jennifer's my Pilates instructor.

Yeah, Pilates.

You're certainly whipping
Lyndsey into shape.

Not that you need it.

Not that I was looking.

Not that you're listening.

- Oh. Can I take a picture of you?
- Okay.

Uploading photo to wall.
"Check out my hot date. " Smiley face.

LOL, right?

So, Pilates. That's all about
strengthening the core, right?

Hmm?

OMG. Cat in a bow tie,
riding a skateboard.

Re-tweeting! Ha-ha.

Guy in a bow tie, right here.

Oh, good news,
one person already likes our date.

Unfriend.

- So, what looks good to you?
- Actually, I'm not gonna eat.

- Nothing?
- No, I'm doing a master cleanse.

So, I haven't eaten solid food
in two weeks.

You might have mentioned that
when I told you we were going to dinner.

No, it's no problem. You guys eat.
This stuff just flushes you right out.

I guess it's worth it, if it rids the body
of all those toxins and impurities.

Right. And the stuff
that comes out of you...

...I swear, I found a Barbie head
that I swallowed in the fifth grade.

Good thing you didn't swallow
her Malibu beach house. Heh-heh. Ouch.

Whatever you're doing, it's working.

- You look great.
- Thank you.

I also inject myself
with the urine of pregnant women.

Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna eat either.

It's got a hormone in it
that helps you lose weight.

Which is ironic, because pregnant women
pack on the pounds.

I will never be fat.

Or married.

I can't believe that you created
and sold your own company.

You must be incredibly smart.

Yeah, I don't know,
I think it's more luck and timing.

I think it takes a little bit more than luck
and timing to make 1.4 billion dollars.

- Somebody did their research.
- I'll bet women are after you all the time.

I mean, you could look like him
and they'd still be after you.

- I don't-
- You know what women are thinking:

"Is this guy gonna ask for a pre-nup?" Heh.

Theoretically, your alimony payments would
run 75, a hundred grand a month at least.

- And that's without child support.
- Good at math.

You know, I never thought I wanted kids.

But with the right person,
I could see myself having an entire litter.

I could see myself having a vasectomy.

When she's on her meds,
she's actually lots of fun.

I am.

Hey.
- Hey.

Got off the phone with Lyndsey.
She's got another friend.

- She says this one's perfect.
- No. No more women, Alan.

Wait. They were all women, right?

In the eyes of the law, yes.

The Olympics... Eh.

Look, I know some of the dates
didn't work out.

Didn't work out?

One of them used her roast chicken...

...to show me
where she was probed by aliens.

Ah. But you have to admit
the chicken was out of this world.

- Lyndsey and I are trying to help.
- Yeah.

I appreciate it.
But I think I was wrong.

I just don't think
I'm ready to date right now.

- So you're giving up?
- No, I'm not giving up. I just...

I wanna change my pattern.

You know, my whole life, I've jumped
from one woman to the next.

I thought that's because every time you
jumped another woman slid in under you.

Well, there's that.
But let's face it...

...I went from my mother's house
to being married to Bridget.

From Bridget to dating Zoey.
And now, I'm trying to go from Zoey...

...to a bunch of starving, crying,
gold-digging, crazy-ass bitches.

Hey, if it weren't for those women,
I'd still be a virgin.

And there'd be no reality TV stars.

Look, I'm just gonna be alone for a while.

And if the real thing comes along,
I'll know it.

That's true.
I can still remember the exact instant...

...that I knew Lyndsey was the one.

- How'd you know?
- She said, I give up, you're the one.

- Hey, Walden.
- Hey.

- You here by yourself?
- Yes, I'm alone.

And I plan to stay that way.

Oh, well. If you change your mind, there's
a bachelorette party in the corner...

...with a couple of drunk
and bitter bridesmaids.

Fish in a barrel.

- That's good to know. Not tonight.
- All right. What can I get you?

- I'll have a beer.
- Coming up.

Excuse me.

Can I have your nuts?

- What?
- Your nuts.

Here you go.

Thank you. I'm Rose.

- Hi, Rose. I'm-
- Walden, I know.

I heard the bartender say "Hey, Walden."
I mean, how else would I know your name?

- It's nice to meet you, Rose.
- You too, Walden.

I prefer real books.

- Some people do.
- You know why I do?

Because if you use this to fix
a wobbly table, it costs you 800 dollars?

Nope. You can't hide a gun in an iPad.

No, I guess you can't.

- Sorry, I'll leave you alone.
- Thanks.

Oh, my God, are you okay?

- Nut. I can't breathe.
- Okay, don't panic.

Oh...

Thank you, you saved my life.

- Can we get a glass of water over here?
- And I'll have a martini.

All right, I'm getting ready to leave.
Do you need anything before I go?

- Mm. Actually, if you don't mind I could really-
- Just making small talk, Zippy.

Hey.
- Hey, how was your night?

Great. In fact, I met a girl.

Of course you did.
I hate you, but I hate me more.

This girl is really interesting.
Actually, I think you know her.

- Her name's Rose.
- See you.

- Wait, Rose? Crazy Rose?
- She's not crazy.

You know what? Name-calling is cruel.

How would you like it if somebody called
you Old Alan or Cheap Alan or Loser Alan?

Somebody does.

Did Rose tell you
she stalked my brother?

Actually, she told me everything.

You know, she was in love with him.
And I get it.

When you're in love,
love makes you do crazy things.

- No. Crazy makes you do crazy things.
- We all have skeletons in our closets.

Yes, but in her case,
they may be actual skeletons.

She told me you were gonna do this.

Of course she did.
She's devious and deceptive.

She's probably listening to us,
right now.

Hey, Rose. How you doing?

Alan, calm down. I had a conversation
with the woman, I'm not marrying her.

- I don't even know if I'll ever see her again.
- Oh, you will. Trust me.

Her face will be the last thing you see
before you black out from the chloroform.

Rose?

- Oh, Walden, hi.
- Hi.

Wait a minute,
you're not stalking me, are you?

Good one. No, I stop here every day
on my way to work.

- It's kind of a ritual.
- Really?

There is no way
I would ever have known that.

- Do you mind if I join you?
- Please.

How can I say no to the man
who saved me from choking on his nuts?

I told Alan that we met.
Boy, did you call that one.

Oh. Let me guess, at some point did he say,
"She's probably listening to us, right now.

Hey, Rose. How you doing?"

- It's like you were there.
- But I wasn't.

He is very suspicious of you.
He thinks you have some kind of plan.

Are you suspicious of me?

I'm more curious than suspicious.

Good. Because that's my plan.

Does your plan
include having dinner with me?

- Oh, gee. I don't know about that.
- Why not?

You live in Charlie's old house,
there's Alan... Lots of baggage.

None of that stuff
has anything to do with us.

- That's true.
- So, what do you say? Dinner?

Okay. To dinner.

It will be nice to go out
with someone normal for a change.

Hello, Alan.

Rose, you've got a lot of nerve
coming to this house.

As much nerve as you have
still living in it?

TouchÃ©.

Oh. This place looks fantastic.

Don't act like you haven't seen it before.

- I know what you're up to.
- Oh, really? What am I up to?

All right, I don't know specifically.

Walden is my best friend.
I will not let you hurt him.

He's very lucky to have you,
given what he's been through.

Oh, which you know,
because you've been spying on us.

No, I know, because he told me.

He's very fond of you, Alan.

You finally made a friend.
Don't screw it up.

Oh, you're good.

I'm totally confused right now.

- Ah. There she is.
- Hi, Walden.

- Are you two playing nice?
- I am. I don't know what she's up to...

...but I know it ends with the audience
yelling, "Don't go in the cellar."

You're funny. He thinks
I've hatched some nefarious plot.

- Are you after my money?
- No, you're thinking of Alan.

Are you planning on cloning me
and run my doppelgÃ¤nger for president...

...so you can be
puppet-master of the nation?

Guilty. Heh. Better get a sample right now.

I get it. Hair, DNA and all.

Uh... Well, just stop worrying. Don't you have
somewhere you need to be?

Matter of fact,
Lyndsey and I were going to the movies.

- Have a good time.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

Watch yourself, buddy.

- He means well.
- I know.

- Can I pour you a glass of wine?
- Yeah, that would be great.

Aha!

Actually, I just forgot my keys.

And your wallet.

Oof. Shouldn't have eaten
that whole tub of popcorn.

I'm gonna be gassy all night.

It's gonna take
more than a bloated belly...

...to put a muzzle on Mr. Pokey.

- What was that?
- I don't know.

- But I've got a bad feeling about this.
- Oh.

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Walden?

What?

I'm coming in.

Don't worry, buddy.
I told you she was nuts.

Get out of here.

- What?
- Get out of here.

I'm having the best sex of my life.

Oh, hi, Alan.
How was the movie?

It was... Wait, is that a leaf-blower?

That's not what they call it
in Amsterdam.

Oh...

Hi, Jake.

Rose? What are you doing there?

I'm dating Walden.

I should've seen that coming.

- How's the Army?
- How'd you know I was in the Army?

I've been spying on you guys.

- What?
- I'm kidding. You're wearing a uniform.

Oh, yeah, right.

Don't worry about the obstacle course.
You'll get it.

Yeah, the rope climb is...
Hey, wait a second.

- How did you know that-
- Gotta go. I'll tell your dad you called.

How did I know he was in the army?
Heh. So cute.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

Zoey, will you do me
the honor of becoming...

...Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce-Schmidt?

No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

She can-

- I need an answer.
- There's someone else.

Look, I'm just gonna be alone
for a while.

And if the real thing comes along,
I'll know it.

Excuse me, can I have your nuts?

This girl's really interesting. Actually I
think you know her. Her name's Rose.

See you.

And she's devious and deceptive.

She's probably listening to us
right now. Heh.

Hey, Rose. How you doing?

I told Alan that we met.
Boy, did you call that one.

Let me guess, at some point did he say,
"She's probably listening to us now!"

- "Hey, Rose! How you doing?"
- He is very suspicious of you.

- Are you suspicious of me?
- I'm more curious than suspicious.

- Good.
- So, what do you say? Dinner?

To dinner.

It will be nice to go out
with someone normal for a change.

- Yay.
- Yay, indeed.

Ooh.

We went a mile and a half.

- What is that, a pedometer?
- Yeah, I'm measuring our sex life.

And as of today,
we are in Laughlin, Nevada.

Well, I believe
I did most of the driving.

Yes, but when you got a flat,
I stopped and pumped it up.

Call me crazy, and the state of California
did for a while...

...but these last couple of weeks
have been the best of my life.

Mm. They have been great.

With the last mile and a half
being a particular high point.

That's because you finally stopped
and asked for directions.

- Okay, I better get going.
- Wait, no, no...

- ...stay the night.
- All my stuff is at my house, silly.

- What stuff?
- I don't know, my toothbrush.

- You can use mine.
- Ugh.

After what we just did...

...you're really concerned with
having my toothbrush in your mouth?

I'm just saying, at some point
I have to go home.

What if you never had to go home?

Do you mean,
like you're gonna tie me up...

...and keep me bound
and gagged in the closet?

Uh, no, I was thinking more like
you move in with me.

Mm. That's a little odd.

I mean, come on, you said so yourself,
the last few weeks have been fantastic.

- We get along great. Why not?
- Why not?

Because I don't wanna
be a flavorless cracker.

Sure.

What?

Well, you know
when you order a cheese plate...

...and you get two different
kinds of stinky cheese...

...and then you eat that little bland,
unsalted cracker...

...in between to cleanse your palate?

Not really.
But you explained it pretty well.

Well, I don't wanna be the bland cracker.
I wanna be the stinky cheese.

Okay, I think I understand.

You're concerned because
I just got out of a serious relationship...

...and you don't want to be the girl
that gets me to the next one.

- Exactly.
- Well, trust me.

You are the stinkiest cheese
I have ever met.

That's so sweet.

I don't know, it's moving so quickly.
I mean, who could've seen this coming?

Well, I know it's moving quick.

But I'm the kind of person when
I see something I want...

...I stop at nothing to get it.

Well, I guess opposites really do attract.

Just promise me
that you'll think about it.

And you'll think about
tying me up in your closet?

- I will.
- That seems fair.

You know if we get started now...

...we could make it to Salt Lake City
by daybreak.

Ooh. Okay, but this time I'm driving.

I can't believe this,
after everything she's done.

I know. How did someone like that
worm their way back in here?

Maybe she learned from the master.

I just worry she's gonna
take advantage of Walden.

You do hear yourself when you talk,
right?

Yes, yes, I'm a mooch,
but I'm not dangerous.

Some night, I'm gonna get drunk
and try that.

- Here he comes, here he comes.
- Morning.

Morning. So, uh, how's everything
going with my favorite couple?

Walden and Rose.

Wose. Ralden.

Look, Alan, I know you're suspicious
of her, but she really makes me happy.

No, I totally get that and
I don't wanna sound judgmental...

...but she scares the living crap
out of me.

You're gonna have
to make peace with it.

Because not only do I like Rose,
I asked her to move in with me.

- What's so funny?
If you don't know, it's too late.

Oh, that's my cell.
Could you grab it for me?

- It says, "Do not answer."
- Oh. That's Zoey.

It reminds me to stay strong
and not take her calls.

Hello? Hey, Zoey.
Yeah, what's going on?

Yeah, I could do that.

- She wants to go for coffee.
- Why?

- I don't know.
- Ask her.

Hey, uh, just so
I have a heads-up, is this a sad coffee...

...or a happy coffee?

- It's a happy coffee.
- That's great.

- And can you bring me back a scone?
- Shut up.

Uh... Yeah, great, I'll be there in 20. Okay.

So, what do you think's going on?

I don't know. Uh...

- She said she wants to talk in person.
- Ooh, be careful.

In my experience,
when an ex wants to talk in person...

...it's either to borrow money
or tell you she gave you crabs.

And no one's ever asked me
for money.

You share too much.

- Besides, she said it was a happy coffee.
- Ooh, ooh.

Maybe she wants to have sex
with the ex. That's happened to me.

Be careful, that's how I got the crabs.

Well, I'm not gonna sleep with her.
I'm with Rose now.

Oh. Are you gonna tell Rose
that you're meeting Zoey for coffee?

Yes, I am not.

- Good call.
- Hey, how do I look?

Like every screen-saver
in San Francisco.

Perfect. Okay.

Hey, what does it say on your phone
when I call?

Uh, it says "The old guy
who lives downstairs."

Perfect.

- Here we go, happy coffee.
- Thank you.

- So how you been?
- Mm. Good.

- You?
- Good.

Good.

- Are we done lying?
- Mm.

Okay, so here it is.
Oh, God, this is very embarrassing. Heh.

Crabs?

- What?
- Nothing. Go on.

So when you asked me to marry you...

- ...it scared me.
- Why?

Went down that road before, Walden.
I got lost.

I wasn't ready to make
that kind of commitment again.

Wait a second,
what about the other guy? Peter.

- I broke up with him.
- So sorry.

Oops. Apparently, I'm not done lying.

You care to know
why I broke up with Peter?

Because he wasn't a
very good pumpkin eater?

No, I broke up with him
because when I was with him...

...all I could think about was you.

Well, this is a very happy coffee.

- I'd like another chance, Walden.
- My coffee is dancing.

So do you wanna try
and make this work?

- I do. But it's a little complicated.
- Oh, God, you're seeing someone?

- Well, I'm-
- Is it serious?

Nobody's brought
their toothbrush over.

I'm sorry, I've put you
in a very awkward position.

No, no, it's okay. I just- I need
a little time to figure it out.

Of course you do. I completely
understand. Take all the time you need.

You decided yet?

I'm kidding.

Look, do what you need to do
and let me know what happens, okay?

- Um...
- Thanks for meeting me.

- Yeah, I'm glad you called.
- Heh-heh.

Oh, boy.

Crabs would've been simpler.

You're not gonna believe this.

Zoey realized she made a huge mistake
and she wants me back.

- Is that crazy, or what?
- No.

No?

Follow me.
I want to show you something.

- Rose?
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

I brought my toothbrush.

That's crazy.

- So, yeah, you decided to move in.
- Yep.

You make me so happy.
And now we never have to be apart.

Never?

- Never, ever.
- Hm.

Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm gonna go upstairs...

...and make sure the birds are settled.

- Great.
- Never, ever, ever.

Did she say birds?

Well, I counted four, uh, but one of them
might be dinner for the ferrets.

- Ferrets?
- I think they were ferrets.

Might have been weasels.

Either way, she recommended
we all get rabies shots.

Oh, God, what have I done?

You asked her to move in.
You invited the vampire into the house.

Look, in my defense,
the vampire was naked at the time!

- So, what are you gonna do now?
- I don't know. I guess just...

Man up and tell Rose
I made a mistake.

Ooh, that's a bad idea.

Especially before
you get the rabies shot.

Have you got a better one?

Uh, you could always tell her that...

...your work is taking you to Europe
or that you're dying...

...or that you realized you're gay and sick
of fighting the feelings you have for me.

- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- Would it be a lie?

Look at us, we're like Siamese twins...

...except we don't have to share
any organs unless we want to.

Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

Sure.

- Jeez, this is tough.
- Just say it.

I want us to be able to talk
about anything.

Okay, here it goes. Um...

- I'm in love with Alan.
- What?

- I'm dying.
- You're dying?

For work in Europe.

Walden, what is going on?

Okay. Um...

My old girlfriend called
and she wants to try again.

How do you feel about that?

I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't thinking about it.

Are you still in love with her?

Yes, I am.

I'm sorry, Rose.

No.

No, don't be sorry.

Walden, we've only known each other
for a couple of weeks.

And as wonderful as it's been, if you feel
that you'd be happier with Zoey...

...I'm not gonna stand in your way.

Thank you.

Wait, how did you know
her name is Zoey?

Zoey's a very popular name
in England.

Wait, how do you know
she's English?

Because her name's Zoey, silly.

Goodbye, Walden.

Goodbye, Rose.

You know I want you to be happy,
don't you?

I do. And I want you to be happy too.

Thank you.

Ferrets, attack!

- Hey, buddy, how you doing?
- Great. I got a promotion.

Oh, no kidding.

- Yep. I'm the dessert chef in the officers' mess.
- Wow.

I made this killer crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e
for the enlisted guys and word got out.

Jake, I am so proud of you.

They gave me my own blowtorch.
You know, to caramelize the sugar.

Check it out.

Uh-oh. Not again.

Gotta go, Dad.

Well, he's America's problem now.

Hi.

- Hello.
- Sorry to bother you...

- ...I'm a friend of Walden's.
- Oh, really?

- Yes, and we need to talk.
- About what?

It's complicated.

I'll get it.

- Zoey.
- Who the hell is-?

What has happened to your face?

- I was attacked by ferrets.
- Fine, don't tell me.

Who is that crazy woman
who just showed up at my house...

...saying she's carrying your baby?

- Uh...
- I have a guess.

- Alan, please.
- Do you know anything about this?

All right, I'm just gonna level with you.
You moved on.

So I was trying to do the same thing.
But she's not pregnant.

Then why would she show
up at my apartment claiming to be?

- Apparently she's crazy.
- Told you.

Alan, shut up!

All right, look, as soon as you told me
you wanted to get back together...

...I told her she had to move out
because I was in love with you.

- And that's the truth. I love you, Zoey.
- Wait. She was living here?

Did you hear the part
where I said I love you?

What happened to
"no one's brought their toothbrush"?

Uh-

- Alan?
- You told me to shut up.

- Oh, God. Goodbye, Walden.
- No, Zoey, wait!

You're my stinky cheese.

Great.

Aww.

I'm sorry, buddy.

- But look at the bright side.
- I know, I still have you.

Forever and ever and ever.

Hey, why don't we go out, you know?
Maybe grab a bite?

- Might cheer you up.
- I don't wanna go out.

Oh, you have to eat.

You want me to pick
something up for you?

- Fine.
- Great, oh, so, listen, um, I-

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

Uh, would you mind if I take your car?
Mine's out-

Out of gas, sure.

Berta's right. I am the master.

Oh, boy, a radio and brakes. Heh.

Oh, yeah, I can get used to this. Heh.

Not the face! Not the face!

- I've made a decision.
- What's that?

I'm never gonna care
about another human being.

Ouch.

- Except you.
- That's better.

I can't believe I lost Zoey again.

I can't believe
I lost the tip of my pinky to a ferret.

Boo-hoo. I have half a nipple.

All right, good night, Alan.

Good night, Walden. Aah.

- Good night, Rose.
Good night, Alan.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

- What you doing here?
- Got a weekend pass.

- I took a train in to surprise you guys.
- Hi, soldier.

- Hello.
- You must be Jake.

- I'm sleeping in your room.
- Well, God bless America.

You are just so sweet.
I swear I could just eat you up.

But, you know, then I'd probably get
a sugar rush.

- Missi still sleeping?
- No, she's in the shower.

Oops.

I get another pass in a month.
Maybe we can see each other then.

I sort of have a boyfriend.

Boyfriend? But I thought you-

Goodbye, Jake.

Don't be a hero.

What the hell just happened?

- Hey.
- Hey.

Wait, I thought you had a date
with Lyndsey.

Oh, yeah, I was supposed to,
but we decided to take a little break.

- How come?
- Oh, I'm not privy to that information.

All I was told is we need to take a break.

So you're supposed to just wait around...

...until she decides you're worthy
of her presence?

Or until she needs her rain gutters
cleaned out.

And that's not a euphemism.

This is the kind of crap you put up with
when you're in a relationship.

Oh, but it's a small price to pay
for love, companionship...

...and a parking spot for the pink Prius.

It's hard to believe
that Lyndsey needed a break from you.

If you will excuse me, I have a date
with an extra-large meat lover.

That did not sound right.

I ordered a pizza.

- Walden.
- Missi?

I am so sorry to show up unannounced,
but me and my mom got in this huge fight...

...over whether or not I should pay rent.

I said, "If I pay, your boyfriend should too."
He said, "Don't sass your mother."

I said, "Do not tell me what to do.
I am six months older than you."

Anyway, you said I was welcome here
anytime I want.

So ding-dong, here I am.

- Alan, how are you?
- I'm good. What brings you here?

- Me and my-
- No, no.

Hey.

- Jake, what are you doing here?
- I got a weekend pass.

Missi? What are you doing, here?

Jake? What a surprise.

- I'm suspicious.
- You think?

I just can't get over this coincidence.
I mean, what are the odds...

...the same weekend I come home,
Missi just-

Jake, let it go.

Missi, help me out here.
I thought you guys broke up.

We did. But then Jake sent me
this giant cookie he baked...

...that was shaped like a heart and said,
"I Missi You. " And I just melted.

Well, you know, I can't take all the credit.
The cookie was loaded with pot.

So, Jake, you wanna go
to your bedroom and unpack?

That's okay, I don't really have much.

Well, then maybe
you could help me unpack.

Why?

Dude, she's not really talking
about unpacking.

Oh. Oh, okay, yeah. I could definitely go
for a good unpacking.

MISSI:
Well, then come on.

Hey, maybe later we could go
for a walk on the beach.

Oh, yeah.

She means an actual walk
on the beach.

That's it. I'm out of here.

- Where you going?
- Someplace quiet.

- What are you talking about? It's quiet here.
- Wait for it.

MISSI: Jake, slow down.
There's a zipper on this thing.

Oh, God,
I can't hear my son having sex. Ugh.

Push it good

Ah, push it

Much better.

Wow.

Excuse me?

I'm sorry. That- That was involuntary.

I just think you're very beautiful.

Thank you.

If we weren't in a library,
I would have applauded.

Got it. Thanks.

I'm sorry. What are you doing here?

Nobody goes to the library anymore.

Oh, it's one of the few places
that I can go to...

...where strange men don't hit on me.

Oh.

Sorry. It's- I'll leave you alone.

I come here because they have a great
collection of Thomas Edison diaries.

They're very illuminating.

Get it? It's Thomas Edison's?

The light bulb?

Never mind.

Just for the record,
I wasn't hitting on you.

I was just making small talk.

Duly noted.

Last thing I would wanna do
is hit on anyone.

I'm taking a time out from the whole
"boy meets girl, girl dumps boy...

...boy doubts his worth
as a human being" thing.

Okay.

Oh, for God's sake.
Would you like to join me?

- Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to impose.
- Just get over here.

- Walden.
- Whitney.

Hi. So, Whitney, tell me about yourself.
What do you do?

- I'm an actress.
- Oh.

- How's that going?
- Not so good.

- I haven't worked in almost two years.
- Ooh.

Tough business
or are you just not talented?

What do you mean,
am I "just not talented?"

You don't know me.
You don't know what I can do.

You're lucky I don't reach under this table,
rip off your balls and feed them to you.

Sorry. It's my bad.

And scene.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Where's Missi?
- She's unpacking.

You know, for real.

- Right. I'm glad you're having fun.
- Oh, I am.

I can't imagine ever being
with anyone else.

Yeah, I remember that feeling.

You kiss a girl, see fireworks,
and fall head over heels in love.

And then, one day, you wake up
in a cold, loveless marriage...

...with a soul-sucking shrew
who makes you wish for an early death.

Uh, you realize you're talking about
my mother.

Yeah. So you get it.

So anyway,
after I moved out to Los Angeles...

...I promised myself I'd give it two years.

And if I wasn't a star by then,
I'd move home and get a real job.

- So how much time do you have left?
- Eleven days.

Well, that's four more than God took.

God didn't have my agent.

Listen, if I could hire you to act, I would.

Thank you. I appreciate that.

You know, what if I could hire you?

- For what?
- Well, stick with me...

...because I'm just thinking out loud here.

See, here's the thing.

I'm a serial monogamist,
but I'm not very good at relationships...

...because they're emotional,
they get messy...

...people fall in and out of love,
somebody ends up crying.

That's usually me.

Walden, I'm not gonna date you.

Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to date me.

What if I hired you
to play the role of my girlfriend?

You think I'm a hooker?

No, no, no. No sex. I-
You know, take sex off the table.

In fact, take it off the table,
the car, the floor, the bed...

...windmill at the putt-putt golf course.

Okay.

So I'm supposed to just believe
that some random guy...

...that I meet in the public library...

...is going to pay me
to be his sex-free companion?

How does this not end
with my head in a freezer?

- Google me.
- What?

Walden Schmidt. Google me.

Wow, that's a lot of zeros.

Are you really a genius,
entrepreneur, philanthropist?

I also fight crime.

- What do you say?
- You know how weird this is, right?

What is weird about wanting
to control every aspect of a relationship...

...by using money as a weapon?

Okay, let me rephrase that.

- How does 5 grand a week sound?
- Sounds like you got a girlfriend.

- Morning.
- Morning.

- Where's Jake?
- Oh, he's still sleeping...

...because in the Army,
he has to get up at 4.

In the military, that's 0400. Don't understand
why they need the "oh" or "hundred."

"What time is it?" "Four. " Boom, done, next.

I don't understand
watches without the numbers on it.

- I mean, I never know what-
- Missi.

I love you dearly, but you gotta shut up.

Well, all I heard was, you love me dearly.

Oh, you're here.

And action.

You're adorable.

I brought you an iced coffee,
no sugar, soy milk.

That's exactly the way that I like it.
How'd you know?

You're my boyfriend.
It's my business to know.

Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.
Three words: beer, wings, football.

Okay, three more words:
best girlfriend ever.

- I'll just go get changed.
- Why?

- This is a smelly shirt. I haven't showered.
- Stinky. Just the way I like it.

Oh, this is good.

Can I fart in the car?

- Hello?
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.

Is this the residence
of Private Jake Harper?

- Yes, it is. Is everything okay?
- No, sir. He's absent without leave.

- He's AWOL?
- Now we've both said it.

If he doesn't return to the base within 24
hours, he will be brought up on charges.

- Oh. That's not good.
- No, sir. It's bad.

Uh- Well, I- I haven't seen him.

But, you know, if I do,
I will get in touch right away.

- Immediately.
- Thank you, sir.

- Okay.
- Here's our contact information.

Good day, sir.

MISSI:
Jake. Ha, ha, ha.

Jake?

Not now, Dad.

The military police were at the door
looking for you.

What'd you tell them?

- I told them you weren't here.
- Oh, thanks. See you at dinner.

- Are you kidding me, Jake? AWOL?
- Oh, come on, it's not that big a deal.

You could go to jail.

Really? That seems a little extreme.

All right, enough. Get your things,
I'll drive you to the base.

No, I'm staying here with Missi.

- This is not a discussion. Let's go.
- Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

I'm 18 and I'm in the Army.

You're using the excuse that you're
in the Army to not go back to the Army?

- Hey. Why don't you let me go talk to him.
- Think you can bring him to his senses?

I'm good at getting people
to do what I want.

They call me the People Whisperer. Like
the Horse Whisperer except with people.

I don't whisper. Tried it with a horse.
He was looking at me like I was crazy.

Kind of like you're doing right now.
I'll go talk to Jake.

She cannot become my daughter-in-law.

Oh, good, you're going back.

Nope. You and me are getting out of here.

- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter. I just wanna be with you.

Jake, I gotta go back home. I have a job.

Hey, if I can leave the Army,
you can leave your job.

Whoa, slow down.

Why? I love you and you love me, right?

Right?

Jake, you have to know
how much I really like you.

Oh, man.

But you're in good company
because I only really like great things.

You know, like ice cream sundaes
and jumping up and down on bubble wrap.

And that bear in the commercial
that wipes his butt on the tree.

Okay, I heard it that time.
I do gotta shut up.

- I brought you another beer.
- Ugh. Come on, I don't know if I should.

Oh, come on, drunk guys are hot.

Yeah, I gotta tell you, Whitney,
I am having the best time with you.

Good. Because I think you're wonderful.

Thanks.

- Do you really mean that?
- Of course I do.

You're smart, you're funny.
Not to mention, very handsome.

Ah, too late. You mentioned it. Ha, ha, ha.

No, but seriously, I am so glad I met you.

Thanks. Me too.

See, here's the thing.

- I really mean it.
- So do I.

Okay, I don't know if you're saying that
because I'm paying you...

...or if you really believe it.

How does it feel to you?

It feels like you mean it.

Then that's all that matters.

What? No, it's not.

See, I wanna know if it's for "real" real...

...or if it's "best performance
by a girlfriend hired in a library" real.

Because on my end, it is real.

Me too.

Okay, if I wasn't paying you,
would you still feel that?

It wouldn't matter
if you were paying me or not.

- But I am paying you.
- Which doesn't change the way I feel.

Okay, let's try this another way.

I want you to feel that it's really real...

...for "real" real.

And that is exactly how I feel.

Son of a bitch.

Hey.

Hey.

- You okay?
- What do you care?

Come on, Jake, you know I care.

- I feel so stupid.
- No.

You're not stupid.

You wanna hear stupid?

One time I drank an entire Slurpee
in one slurp...

...had a three-hour brain freeze
and my pee looked like Windex.

- What the hell are you talking about?
- Don't know, I'm not real good with silence.

Just promise me
you'll go back to the Army.

Yeah, I'm going back.

Good.

Hey. We did have some fun,
though, right?

Yeah, we did.

Well, just remember that part.

Goodbye, Jake.

Where am I gonna find
another girl named Missi?

Hey.

Hey.

- Where's your new girlfriend?
- She's off for the day.

Where's your boyfriend?

We kind of broke up.

How come?

You know, I just thought I was coming here
for a fun weekend, no strings attached.

But then Jake told me that he loved me
and I just couldn't say it back.

- Ouch.
- I wasn't trying to hurt him. It's just...

...he's not my soul mate.

Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there is no such thing.

That's not true.
Everybody has a soul mate.

When you find yours, it's like that feeling
after the first big snowfall of the year.

You race outside to go sledding and you go
to the top of the steepest hill you find.

Your heart starts racing, you get sweaty
even though all your boogers are frozen.

Next thing you know,
you are zipping down Montague Street...

...laughing and crying all at the same time
and you never want it to end.

And that's what real love should feel like.

Nobody should settle for anything less.

- Remember when I told you to shut up?
- I'm sorry.

- I know.
- No.

Don't ever listen to me again.

Because that was awesome.

Where you going?

I'm gonna go see if my girlfriend wants
to really be my girlfriend.

And the People Whisperer strikes again.

And we're flying down the hill.

And you're all sweaty and there are,
like, boogers frozen everywhere.

And the point is,
is I wanna share that feeling with you.

For real.

I'm gay.

- What?
- I like women.

For real?

For real.

Wow.

You're a really good actor.

Thank you.

- Do you wanna go to a movie tomorrow?
- Sure, yeah, that sounds great.

- I love you.
- Love you too, honey.

- You all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

- It's okay to be upset.
- I'm not upset.

If you were, I would understand.

I mean, you give yourself to somebody,
you finally let down all your walls...

...and then they break your heart.

Yeah.

I'm really sorry
you have to go through this.

I mean, it just...
It kills me to see you in pain.

I mean, I know you're a soldier now...

...but you're still my little baby boy.

I remember bringing you home
from the hospital...

...wrapped in your fuzzy, blue blanket.

I love you so much.

I just- I just wish I hurt instead of you.

Dad, it's okay.

No, no, it's not okay.

- Maybe I should drive.
- Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

Thank you.

All I'm saying is you can't give up.

- Your soul mate's out there.
- Yeah, I don't know, Missi.

Gotta keep your eyes and your heart open.
Never know where you're gonna find her.

Could be anywhere. Might even be
at a Costco passing out egg rolls...

...so you can sample the sauce.
Little tip, avoid the Chinese mustard.

Feels good going in,
not so good coming out.

Well, let's just hope I find her
before I get old.

Ooh, then you better hurry up, Grandpa.

Hey, let's make a deal.

Next time you're in town,
assuming you haven't found anyone...

...and I haven't found anyone,
what do you say that you and I-

Ew.

I was gonna say,
"Help each other find someone."

.......... ********** ..........

I feel like I spent the last half hour
yodeling in a cave.

I'm sorry. It wasn't you.

No, it was- It was like licking a lollipop
that never gets any smaller.

I mean, you enjoy it, but after a while,
you start to crave the stick.

Did I at least make you crave
the stick?

You did great.
I'm just a little distracted.

- Is everything okay?
- Not really. We need to talk.

Come on, I got lockjaw
and you wanna talk?

I wanna know where we're going with
this relationship. Do we have any future?

Of course we do.
I mean, things are good.

Things are great. Why rock the boat?

I mean, I know the little man inside
your boat could use some rocking.

I'm talking about making
a long-term commitment to each other.

- You mean, like, marriage?
- Would that be so awful?

Ask my ex-wife. Her statement in court
read like a Stephen King novel.

- Where is this coming from?
- It was something my gynecologist said.

- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

He said,
"Everything looks great down here.

Would you like to have dinner
sometime?"

Wow. Wow. That is wildly inappropriate.

- I mean, as a doctor myself-
- You're a chiropractor.

Nonetheless, I am a healer.
There's a code.

You don't ask someone out when
they're naked with their feet in stirrups.

- Unless you're drunk at a rodeo.
- Well, he did.

- Do you wanna go out with him?
- It's not about going out with him.

But if you and I don't have a future,
I need to examine my options.

The way you got examined
by Dr. Busy-Fingers?

Look, I don't wanna grow old alone.

So if you're not ready to make
this kind of commitment...

...better to know now.

Jeez, Lyndsey,
you kind of sprung this on me.

I don't have to give you an answer
just this second, do I?

No. No, of course not.
Just think about it.

- Okay.
- Good night.

Good night.

For the record,
he gets paid to go down there.

I do it for the love of the game.

- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

Can I borrow your car?
Need to take my bike into the shop.

- It won't fit in mine.
- Sure, no problem.

Thanks. I assume it needs gas?

And oil.

And brake fluid.

And wiper blades.

So, what are you reading?

- I'm trying to finish Ulysses.
- Oh, that's a tough one.

- How long you been reading it?
- Fourteen years.

I'm on page eight.

Impressive.
I'm still on the first Tuesday with Morrie.

- He dies in the end.
- Thank you.

So listen, I wanna ask your opinion.
Lyndsey has been pushing me...

...to make a commitment
because some guy asked her out.

- Who asked her out?
- Her gynecologist.

Well, at least he knows
what he's getting into.

Cute. But I mean,
I don't wanna lose Lyndsey.

But I'm just not ready
to make a commitment.

My advice is,
you better do something soon...

...or you're out and the doctor's in.

When I say, "the doctor's in,"
I mean-

No, I got it, I got it.

- All right, I gotta get out of here.
- Here you go.

Oh, the driver's side door
doesn't work anymore.

So get in the passenger side
or climb in through the window.

- Got it.
- And whatever you do...

...when you put the key in the ignition,
hold something rubber.

You know, so you're grounded.

- Does Lyndsey have a nice car?
- Yeah.

Marry her.

And he's holding her
In his arms late, late at night

WALDEN
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade

Alan.

Ow! Ow. Ow.

Everything okay?

Oh, yeah. Think it just overheated.

- Can I give you a ride to a gas station?
- Gee, I don't know.

My mom always told me never to get
in a car with a stranger.

I'm Shari McMartin.

Solves that problem.

Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Hey, no problem.

So your old Volvo's seen better days,
huh?

Yeah. It's actually- It's not mine.

I borrowed it from a friend
to get my bike fixed.

You ride a bike around town?

You must have amazing stamina.

- It's not the only way that I get around.
- Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed about.

With the price of gas being what it is,
a bicycle is very practical.

- I'm not ashamed.
- Trust me, there will come a day...

...when you won't have to worry
about having enough money for gas.

Okay.

I look forward to that day.

- So, what's your name?
- Walden.

That's a nice name. What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Walden?

You trying to be an actor
or a model or something?

Right now I'm trying to finish a book.

Oh, how long have you been at it?

Fourteen years.

Oh, a struggling writer.

Yes. Yes, I am.

Well, you are in luck. I happen to be
a big supporter of the arts.

Oh, really? How fortuitous.

Ooh. "Fortuitous. " You are a writer.

Listen, what do you say we go grab
a bite to eat, get the car fixed later?

Sure. There's a really great deli
right up here.

Actually, I have a better place in mind.

- Where's that?
- My house.

Oh, what's on the menu there?

Oh.

Yum.

- Hi.
- Hi.

What you doing?

Nothing much.

How about we go out to a movie?

Sure, we could do that.

Great, great. I will check some times.

- Alan?
- Yeah?

Did you think about
what we discussed last night?

Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Thinking about it constantly.

Anything you wanna talk about?

Not yet.

Still thinking.
You know, percolating, mulling...

...all the other pertinent "ings."

Cogitating.

Stalling, avoiding, ducking.

- Ooh! Procrastinating.
- What? No, no.

That's crazy.
I'm not doing any of those things.

I mean, why would I do those things?
So, what movie would you like to see?

I know what you're doing.
This is not gonna go away.

I don't understand why
we can't keep things the way they are.

Living day-to-day,
never knowing what future you have...

...with the person you've been with
the past three years?

Okay, I prefer to think of it
as cherishing each day...

...nay, each moment,
with the woman I love...

...because none of us knows
how much time we have left.

I mean, it could all disappear
in the blink of an eye.

You mean like this?

Exactly.

Well, it would appear that a bicycle's
not the only thing you can ride.

I'm also good with bulls
and merry-go-rounds.

Did you enjoy your lunch?

Oh, yeah.

I would definitely eat here again.

Mm-mm.

Do you mind taking a taxi home?

Uh, sure. No problem.

I'd drive you.
I just have some things to do.

Okay.

Then we're done here?

I am.

Okay.

- You know, we should do this again.
- Oh, we will.

I'll let you know when.

- All right.
- Oh, here.

What's this?

- It's money for a taxi.
- I don't need that.

Sweetie, don't be proud.
Take the money.

Okay, great.

Thank you.

- Hey, hey!
- Hey. Where have you been?

I got some good news
and I got some bad news for you.

- What's the bad news?
- Your car overheated and broke down.

Ah, I should've told you
not to turn on the radio.

So, what's the good news?

This beautiful woman pulls up
in a Bentley and offers me help.

And then she takes me back to her house
and bangs my brains out.

- How is that good news for me?
- Oh, sorry, I misspoke.

The bad news is for you,
the good news is for me.

Have any idea how many times
I've been stranded because of that car?

Only person who stopped was a trucker
with no pants and drawn-on eyebrows.

- She also gave me money for a taxi.
- I hate you.

I know, right?

- How was your day?
- I'm pretty sure Lyndsey and I broke up.

Oh, man. I'm sorry.

I really liked Lyndsey.
I thought she was great.

But I'm not gonna be bullied
into spending my life...

...with somebody
just because they're great.

Who would?
It's like being forced to win the lotto.

Wait a minute.
If you took a cab home, where's my car?

Oh.

Here's a hundred bucks.
Buy a better car.

So you ready for round two?

Oh, right now?

Well, could we just talk a little...

...while the boys, you know,
restock the shelves?

Yeah, sure, let's talk. Um...

How are things going with your book?

How's-? With the what?

Your book?
The one you're trying to finish?

Oh, about the book.

It's good.

It's good.

It's going good.

Writing words.

Making sentences.

What's it about?

Okay. Yeah, it's about this, uh, guy...

- ...named Alan.
- Mm-hm.

He- And he lives with his brother
in this fabulous Malibu beach house.

And?

And the brother dies.

He falls in front of a train in Paris.

Wow, didn't see that coming.

Neither did he.

Anyway,
this billionaire named Walter...

...comes along and he buys the house.

And then-
And Alan continues to live there.

Wait. With a complete stranger?

Yeah.

- Are they gay?
- No, no, no.

They're just- They're just friends.

Well, that's a bit far-fetched, isn't it?

What? No.

Well, it's totally plausible.

They have these adventures together.

It's funny.

It's a good thing you're pretty.

Hey.

Whoa.

Look at you.
Bought some new clothes, huh?

Nope.

Somebody bought new clothes for me.

Shari took her boy toy shopping
in Beverly Hills.

I felt like Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

The only thing I got from the truck driver
was cigarettes and an eyebrow pencil.

Yeah, I gotta tell you, it is nice
to be taken care of for a change.

But look who I'm talking to.

All right, I'm gonna go do
some manscaping.

Mama like me smooth.

- Oh, hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

Well, this is a nice surprise.
What's going on?

I heard from Eldridge that you and his
mom broke up. So I'm just checking in.

That is really sweet of you, Jake,
to be concerned about your old man.

Well, I love you, Dad.
I want you to be happy.

- Thank you.
- You've always been there for me.

- Now I get to be here for you.
- That's true.

- Speaking of which...
- How much?

A couple hundred would make it
a merry Christmas for the people I love.

- All right, Jake, I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Dad. Love you. Bye.

- Bye.
- Totally worked. We're going to Tijuana!

Totally worked.
He thinks I'm sending him money.

- Excuse me, is this seat taken?
- Sit.

But if a lady comes along,
I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate.

Right back at you.

I'm not worried.

- Sid Olsen.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

Alan Harper.

So, Alvin, you play the ponies?

I'm not much of a gambler.

I don't know,
that shirt's kind of a gamble.

So, uh, what brings you in here, Sid,
besides dispensing fashion advice?

I like to get out, make the rounds,
you know, talk to the young people.

But I'll talk to you
until one comes along.

Whether I like it or not.

Oh, I got some more advice for you,
Albert.

When you get to be my age...

...always bring a big, plastic cup
into the john.

- Why?
- You gotta lower the water level...

...or your nuts get wet.

Oh, excuse me, darling, darling, could
we have some more wings, please?

I'll have a beer, please.

- You know, it's "all you can eat" for 6.99.
- It's also dollar beers.

Yeah, I don't drink beer.
It gives me the wind.

- What's your problem, Alfred?
- I don't have a problem.

Oh, come on, you're in a bar
at 4:00 in the afternoon...

...talking to an 80-year-old man
about his balls.

You got a problem.

Well, I guess
I've been having relationship issues.

Ah, I get it.
I'm having trouble with my wife.

- What's the matter?
- She's dead.

- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
- So am I.

If she were alive,
I wouldn't have to be talking to you.

Now we both wish she was alive.

Zing.

Our marriage was the best 30 years
of my life.

My only complaint was
that she couldn't cook.

The woman could screw up iced tea.

I mean, you know the recipe
for iced tea?

It's ice, tea, done.

Well, I guess you have to take the good
with the bad.

You're smarter than you look.

You got a good one,
you gotta hang onto her.

Yeah. How do you know
you've got a good one?

You don't always know.
Sometimes, you just gotta take the leap.

Oh, here we go. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Ah.

These are for my cat.

I don't have a cat.

Well, it was great talking to you,
Archie.

- Alan.
- Sid.

Here's my card.

Oh, thanks.

I'll call you if I need a wingman.

Get it? A wingman? The chicken?

Leave the jokes to me, chuckles.

Jeez. I forgot my wallet.

Don't worry, I've got it.

Thank you. Much appreciated.

Works every time.

- Alan?
- We need to talk.

Oh, really? Now you wanna talk.

I don't know,
you just kind of sprung this on me.

I deserved that. But just listen, please.

Go ahead.

I've just come to the realization...

...that I don't wanna end up alone
with my nuts in the toilet.

- What?
- All I know is this.

I was scared because every time
I've made a commitment to a woman...

...it's blown up in my face.

But I'd rather be scared
than risk losing you.

I wanna be with you forever.

That's all I ever wanted to hear.

I love you, Lyndsey.

And as soon
as I can save enough money...

...I'm gonna put a deposit down
on an engagement ring.

You don't have to buy me
some dumb ring.

That's all I ever wanted to hear.

- Yeah?
- Is your mom here?

My mom?

- Walden, what are you doing here?
- Oh, I just wanted to surprise you.

Oh, that's very sweet.

Baby, go put these in water.

Yeah.

Honey, you really have to call
before you come over.

What's up with the kid from Twilight?

Oh, he works at Foot Locker.

He's like you.
He has a little more ambition.

- Heh, heh. Ambition? You're kidding me.
- Oh, no, don't take that the wrong way.

I mean, you are very good
at what you can do.

Okay.

I'm a billionaire.
I own my own company.

Oh. There's that imagination. Hey,
that's what you should be writing about.

I'll call you, okay?

I own my own freaking jet.

That's it. I'm gonna buy Foot Locker.

Thank you for inviting me over,
Alfonso.

No problem.

You too, Winston.

Any time, Sid.

Look, I don't wanna tar
anybody else's roof...

...but either one of you tapping
the hot redhead?

- No.
- No.

- Mind if I take a swing at her?
- Go right ahead.

Yeah, she might swing back.

Good. I like them feisty.

This may take a minute.

Is your friend pool that shallow?

Hey, Red, you like chicken wings?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously, on Two and a Half Men:

I'm talking about making
a long-term commitment.

You mean marriage?

I don't understand why we can't
keep things the way they are.

Living day-to-day, never knowing
what future you have with a person...

...you've been with the past three years?

Okay, I prefer to think of it
as cherishing each day-

Nay, each moment.
- With the woman I love...

...because it could all disappear
in the blink of an eye.

You mean like this?

- How was your day?
- I'm pretty sure Lyndsey and I broke up.

- I liked Lyndsey. She was great.
- She is. But I'm not gonna be bullied...

...into spending my life with somebody
just because they're great.

- Alan.
- We need to talk.

- Go ahead.
- I wanna be with you forever.

- That's all I ever wanted to hear.
- I love you, Lyndsey.

And as soon as I can save
enough money...

...I'm gonna put a deposit down
on an engagement ring.

- You don't have to buy me some dumb ring.
- That's all I ever wanted to hear.

- Oh! Oh, hey, Jake.
- Hey, Dad.

- What's going on?
- Oh, I've got good news.

- I've got a girlfriend.
- Oh, that's great.

And it gets better: She gave me the clap.

- Wait, wait. How's that better?
- It's a sexually transmitted disease, Dad.

Sexually transmitted.

Disease.

Yeah. So you get it.

Now everybody knows that I'm getting it.

Wait, you're telling people?

No, I don't have to,
because I scream when I pee.

I'm literally speechless, Jake.

- Hey, Walden.
- Oh, hey, Jake.

I got the clap.

Uh...

Congratulations.

Thanks, man. All right, gotta run, Dad,
I'll talk to you later.

I'm going to SeaWorld
with my girlfriend and her three kids.

It's too bad antibiotics
can't cure stupidity.

Hey, that's my son- Eh, you're right.

Huh.

- What?
- I just got an e-mail from my ex-wife.

- She wants to meet me for coffee.
- Judith?

- Oh, no, no, my second wife.
- You got two women to marry you?

Yeah. I had to get the taste of Judith
out of my mouth.

How come you never told me?

There wasn't much to tell.
We got married in Vegas...

...won a half-million-dollar jackpot,
she took the money, moved to New York...

...and became a TV star.

This might be the first interesting story
you've ever told.

- Was she really a TV star?
- Yeah, she's on that cop show, Stiffs.

"If you're not one of the suspects,
you're one of the stiffs."

I love that show.
What-? Who does she play?

Detective Jane Risotto.

Wait a minute. You were married
to tough-talking, smooth-walking...

...pistol-packing Jane Risotto?

Guilty.

Guilty of being with the hottest
woman on Earth.

- I know.
- Hold on.

- Her?
- Yes.

You?

- Yes.
- No.

- Yes.
- No.

And you wonder why
I didn't tell you about this.

- No.
- Yes.

No, no, no.

- Kandi. Over here.
- Alan.

Look at you. You look terrific.

Oh, thank you. And you look- Wow.

That- That dress fits you
like a spray-on tan.

- It's so good to see you.
- Well, you, too.

- So, what are you doing here?
- Meeting you for coffee. Duh.

No, no. I meant,
what are you doing here in L.A.?

Oh. I'm in the new James Cameron movie.

I'm gonna be in 3D.

You'll certainly pop right off the screen.

Pop, pop.

Thanks. So, what's up with you?

- How's Jake?
- Oh, good.

- He's in the Army.
- Wow.

- Yeah.
- Which one?

- Ours.
- Oh, phew.

So look at you, Little Miss Hollywood.

Oh, please. I haven't changed at all.

I'd like a nonfat decaf latte
with just a whisper of foam.

Um, Kandi, he doesn't work here.

- Is that a problem?
- Nope.

So did you ever get remarried?

Oh, no, but I do have a lovely girlfriend.

- Ohh. Good for you
- Thanks.

So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

No. Most guys just want a piece
of Detective Jane Risotto.

Well, as pieces go, that's a good one.

Thanks.

I never told you this,
but you're the best lover I ever had.

Oh. Oh, jeez. I don't know what to say.

But, you know, I certainly gave it
110 percent every time.

Wow. Imagine if you had given it your all.

I'm sorry. You're in a relationship.

We shouldn't even be talking
about this stuff.

That's right. It's just not appropriate.

So didn't you date Derek Jeter
for a while?

I did.

Huh.

- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

Well, something weird just happened,
and I wanted to talk to you about it.

- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, everything's fine. It's just...

- Well, come here, sit down.
- What's going on?

Well, okay, here's the deal.

I just met my ex-wife for coffee,
and she got a little flirtatious with me...

...and it kind of freaked me out.

Wait, Judith got flirtatious with you?

- Oh, no, it wasn't Judith.
- It was the hot one?

Well, I don't think Judith
would appreciate that...

...but yes, it was the hot one.

What do you mean, she was flirtatious?

Oh, the details are unimportant.

I mean, she said I was better in bed
than Derek Jeter, but whatever.

Wait. You want me to believe that
one of the sexiest women in the world...

- ...hit on you and you turned her down?
- Well, yes. Yes, I did.

I told Kandi that I am in a committed
relationship with a woman that I truly love.

And I just wanted to tell you because
I don't want us to have any secrets.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I don't need a young, rich,
gorgeous movie star...

...with flawless skin and a great body.
I have you.

Okay, let me try that again. Um...

- Oh, hey, you should take tomorrow off.
- Why?

It's your birthday.
Nobody should work on their birthday.

Who the hell told you
it was my birthday?

You, when we put you on my health plan.

Damn it, I should have just
lived with that hernia.

Come on, birthdays are terrific.

It's all your loved ones celebrating
how great you are.

It's like Christmas,
except you're the savior of the world.

Sounds good, but all my loved ones
are in jail, rehab, or dead.

I can't think of anything
I'm less interested in than my birthday.

- Boy, do I have a story for you.
- I stand corrected.

- What's going on?
- So I go meet Kandi for coffee.

- It turns out, she wants me.
- No.

- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- No.

- So did you?
- No.

- No?
- Yes.

Hold on, I'm lost.

So when I tell Lyndsey
that I turned down Kandi because of her...

...Lyndsey bangs my brains out.
In the middle of the day.

She could see everything
and she kept going.

- No.
- Yes.

But let's not get caught in this loop again.

All my life, I've had to lie
to have fantastic sex.

Turns out, all I had to do was be honest.
It's almost ridiculous in its simplicity.

From now on, I'm just gonna be
totally honest with women.

- Well, until they catch on to that scam.
- Exactly.

Then it's back to Alan Harper, astronaut.

Hello?

Kandi?

Wait, what-? Why are you crying?

Whoa, slow down.

Okay, not that slow.

How many drinks have you had?

All right, "schlebbin" is not a real number...

...but it sounds like it was a lot.

Oh, no, no, no. Don't talk like that.

You've got plenty to live for.

All right, all right, don't do anything stupid.
I'll be right over.

This is the price I pay
for being the best lover ever.

Where are you going?

Oh, I gotta take care of my drunk,
hysterical ex-wife.

What are you doing up?

Checking the stock market in London.

You're watching porn, aren't you?

I have more than one window open, yes.

Okay, I'll see you.

Wait, hey, you-?
You want me to come with you?

- Oh, no, no, I think I can handle it.
- You think you might get laid.

I have more than one window open, yes.

KANDI:
It's open.

- Kandi?
- Hi.

- Are you okay?
- I am now that you're here.

Wait a minute, what-? What's going on?

On the phone, you were drunk
and practically suicidal.

I was acting.

Acting?

Alan, you don't get
a People's Choice Award for nothing.

So this whole thing was a setup
just to get me over here?

I'm used to getting what I want.

Well, yeah, yeah, Kandi,
but I told you before, I have a girlfriend...

...and- And-
And, oh, God, you smell good.

Kind of like a combination
of pineapple and hope.

I have a couple of old friends here
who wanna say hello.

Hello. Hello.

Why don't we continue this conversation
in the bedroom?

Oh, Kandi, I- I can't.

I mean- I mean, I can.

Parts of me already did.

- But I have to leave.
- All right, fine.

You must really love her.

That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

Jeez. The fact
that you don't want to sleep with me...

...makes me want you even more.

But if you did sleep with me,
you'd be like all the others...

...and then I wouldn't want
to sleep with you.

So if you really don't want to sleep with me,
you should sleep with me.

The scary part is
that makes perfect sense.

Goodbye, Kandi.

Don't forget me, Alan.

As long as there's a slow,
soapy shower in the world...

...you will never be forgotten.

Morning.

Oh, hey, how'd it go
with Kandi last night?

Horrible.
She wanted to have sex with me.

Why do bad things happen
to good people?

Bottom line is,
I took the high road and it sucks.

That's why it's the road less traveled.

- Hey, let me ask you a question.
- Yes, they're spectacular.

I knew it.

Now, my question: What do you
usually do for Berta's birthday?

Oh, well, my brother
would stuff a card full of cash...

...then after he passed out, I'd steam it open,
take a few twenties and sign it.

I kind of get a feeling
that she didn't have anybody...

- ...doing anything special for her.
- Yeah, I don't think she does.

Let me know if you wanna give her cash.
I'll buy the card.

Oh. Hey, Lyndsey.

Whoa. Whoa, calm down.

Kandi's hotel room?
What makes you think I was there?

Paparazzi photos on the Internet?
Uh. Wow.

That- That is just-
That is crazy, Lyndsey.

I don't know what you're talking about.

- Maybe it's this.
- Oh, crap.

Um, well- All right, all right, all right.
I can explain that.

She called at 2 in the morning
and I thought she was drunk and suicidal.

But it turns out, she was just acting.
Do you know she won a People's Choice?

But I swear, nothing happened.

Ha, ha, ha.
This doesn't look like nothing.

Okay, okay, but what you can't see
in that picture is what I was thinking.

And what I was thinking about was you,
the woman I lo- Hello?

Oh, man.

I'm sorry, buddy.

Oh, look, you've been identified
as Matthew Broderick's father.

There's the birthday girl.

I'm not in the mood, Walden.

There is a ton of weed in this.

Happy birthday to me.

- These photos are all over the Internet.
- Oh, God.

Oh, my boobs look good in this one.

Yeah, your boobs look good.
Your life is perfect and I'm gonna die alone.

Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry.
What can I do to help?

Talk to Lyndsey.
Tell her nothing happened.

- She won't listen to me.
- Of course.

Thank you.

It's her voicemail.

- She sounds very pretty.
- Just leave a message.

Oh, hi, Lyndsey. It's Kandi,
Alan's ex-wife and TV's Jane Risotto.

- I'm here with Alan in my hotel room and-
- No.

- What?
- I'm not here.

Got it.

Sorry, wrong number.

So basically, the search results are
processed through the neural back end...

...which allows us to serve ads
that are based on trends...

...that are personalized for the user.

Halfway through that,
your head turned into a taco.

How cool is that? A talking taco.

Talking taco, talking taco, talking taco.

Jeez, I am really high.

There must have been a cat tranquilizer
in that cupcake.

Woof. Ha-ha-ha!

I gotta tell you, Walden, I never thought
that I could work for anybody but Charlie.

But...

...you're a good guy.

That means a lot.

And if truth be told, I don't even mind
seeing Zippy every day.

Whoa.

I must be higher than I thought.

You know...

...when I met you, I was at a real low point.

And you and Alan took care of me.

I gotta say, other than my mother,
you're the closest thing I have to a family.

I love you, Berta.

You're a sentimental little taco,
aren't you?

Hi. We need to talk.

- Go ahead.
- I know you're really upset, but I promise...

...nothing happened between me and Alan.

- I saw the pictures.
- Pictures lie.

- So do boyfriends.
- But not Alan.

Did you really try to seduce him?

I did, but he turned me down.

I was as surprised as you are.

What about all that stuff about you enjoying
sex with Alan more than with Derek Jeter?

Oh, honey, you know better than that.

Hola, Berta.

Feliz birthday-o.

Stop, you're freaking me out.

Okay, all right, I'm gonna call a cab.
I'm too stoned to drive.

I may be too stoned to call a cab.

What about your car?

Oh, you know, just drive it
to my house tomorrow.

I don't know how to drive that thing.

Aw, come on, it's easy, I'll show you.

Help me out here. Where's your door?

Happy birthday.

Sweet Georgia Brown.

You better not be screwing with me.

Nope. You always said
it was your dream car.

- Well, today your dream is coming true.
- Oh!

Come here, you big old talking taco.

Oh, oh. There's one condition.

Okay, you want to do it in the house
or on the hood of the car?

No. Hey.

Alan can never find out about this.

Alan can never find out about this.

Oh, that is great, honey.

Well, I will talk to you later.

Okay, okay, bye-bye.

Wow. Lyndsey is in a better mood.

It's like her head
is in a whole different place.

Ah, ah! It's on.

If you're not one of the suspects...

You're one of the stiffs.

God, she's hot.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Excuse me.
I'm gonna go check the stock market.

Guess what Walden bought me
for my birthday.

.......... ********** ..........

Oh! Incoming, 3 o'clock.

Wow. Heh, heh.

If I were available, I'd be all over that.

Being unavailable's the only thing
that's stopping you?

Well, that and her obvious,
but unvoiced, contempt for me.

Why don't you make a move?

What's the point?
Say I start talking to her and we hit it off.

And by, "hit it off,"
you mean hit it off.

More unvoiced contempt.

I can voice it if you'd like.

No, thanks.

What is gonna happen as soon as she
finds out how much money I have?

She's gonna want you
to make a deposit.

And there's the problem.

I see no problem.

Okay, it's not me
that she'd be interested in.

It's what I can do for her.
It's the lifestyle.

So what? You still got laid.

Yeah, trust me, it gets old.
It's like having a magic golf club.

Every time you take a shot,
the ball goes in.

Oh, yeah. Kerplunk!

Okay, apparently,
you need a demonstration.

And no more alcohol.

- Hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.
- Hello.

That's Schmidt. S-C-H-M-I-D-T.

Uh, okay. It's nice to meet you, Walden.
I'm Susan. S-U-S-A-N.

Can I buy you a drink, Susan?

No, thanks.
I'm waiting for some friends.

- No problem.
- Excuse me.

- There goes your theory. You struck out.
- Au contraire, mon frÃ¨re.

Right now,
she's heading into the bathroom.

- What do you think she's doing in there?
- I'm guessing tinkle.

Girls poop at home.

No, she's wondering:

"Why did he spell his last name?
Maybe I should know who he is."

So now she's taking out her phone
and Googling me.

I tried that once
and I dropped my phone in the toilet.

Fortunately,
it was right after a courtesy flush.

The first hit on my name
is the Forbes 500 website...

...at which point, she finds out
exactly how much money I make.

She forgets to go to bathroom...

...along with everything she learned
in Sunday school.

Slaps on some lipstick
and comes back into the bar.

Wow.

She probably unbuttons
one button on her blouse.

- And...
- You know what?

I changed my mind about that drink.

I still don't see the problem.

I can't believe you're coming home
with me instead of that girl.

Not that I'm not flattered,
and not that I'm not willing to do things.

Just because a woman wants to have sex
with me, doesn't mean I wanna have sex.

I hear the words coming out
of your mouth, I just don't understand.

It's like watching HBO in Spanish.

Look, call me crazy,
but I am determined to find someone...

...who wants to be with me for who I am,
not what I have.

Come on, I bet you have no doubt
as to whether or not Lyndsey loves you.

I guess that's true.

You don't have to guess. You have
no money, no house, no future, no-

Okay, okay, talking past the sale.

- If you think my life is great, take it.
- What?

Pretend to be me. I can't tell you
how many times I pretended to be you.

And not just you. I've also pretended
to be a thoracic surgeon...

...a movie producer, a stockbroker,
and on one occasion, a hand model.

- A hand model?
- Blind girl, long story, didn't end well.

My point is,
you can be whoever you wanna be.

Hm. Never thought about it.

Of course not. Why would Superman
wanna be Clark Kent?

Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna do this.

First thing I need to do is create
an online presence for my fictional self.

Mm, that's good. I usually just throw ketchup
on some scrubs, say I came from surgery.

Okay.
Let's start by creating a Facebook page.

Uh, all right, if I was a struggling,
broke-ass guy...

...what would my name be?
Alan Harper's already taken.

- Ooh! How about Derek Slade?
- That's a little gay.

- Um, Preston Burbank?
- That's just gay from a different decade.

Um, Joey Proccosini.

Sounds like the guy that made
Preston Burbank his prison bitch.

- Oh, uh, how about your porn name?
- My porn name?

When you wanna know what
your name would be as porn star...

...you use the name of your first pet
and the street you grew up on.

Unfortunately, I would be Rusty Knob.

Mine would be
Snowball Honeysuckle.

That'll be a great porn name if Disney
Channel started making adult movies.

No, it needs to be simple,
like something easy to believe.

- John Doe.
- No, it's too simple.

- Bob Doe.
- No.

It's gotta be, like,
right down the middle. You know, like...

- Sam.
- Doe.

Wilson. Sam Wilson.

Really? There's gotta be, like,
a million Sam Wilsons.

No, exactly.
I can get lost in a crowd.

If somebody Googles me,
they'll get a buttload of responses.

Same thing happens
if you Google Rusty Knob.

Just FYI, do not hit "images."
You won't sleep for a week.

Okay, Sam Wilson,
let's create your life.

Male.

Straight.

Single.

One-eighth Apache Indian.

Mix it up a little.

How have I never heard of this place?

I mean, where else can you buy
pants, shoes...

...lettuce and a Garden Weasel
under one roof?

It gets better. You can get a flu shot
and a set of tires at the same price.

This is- All right, what would
a down-on-his-luck Sam Wilson wear?

Oh! Maybe something fringed,
to reflect his Indian heritage.

He's not joining the Village People.

Oh, and check this out.

A dozen socks for 2.49?

That's 20 cents a pair. That's ten
cents a sock! I'm so getting these.

- But you don't wear socks.
- At these prices, I can't afford not to.

Looks like you're getting the hang
of this place.

So if you'll excuse me, I have
a dentist appointment on aisle three.

Don't forget to floss on aisle two.

Leather jacket for 49.99?
Come to papa.

- Sorry.
- Yeah, hang on. Let me just...

The jacket's on a leash.

- I'll just unlock the security cable here.
- Okay, that's better.

- That looks really good on you.
- I bet you've said that before.

About 80 times a day,
but this is the first time I've meant it.

Yeah, it's nice,
but I probably shouldn't.

I mean, for the price of this jacket,
I can buy 240 pairs of socks.

- And your Christmas shopping is done.
- Act surprised when you open them.

- I need to buy a little bit of everything.
- Okay, I can help you out with that.

I appreciate it, Kate.

Not a problem...

Sam. Sam Wilson.

All right, Sam Wilson. Um...

How about we start
with some corduroy pants?

Mm, I'm not a big fan of corduroy.

They're on sale, two for 19.99.

People change.

Anyway,
after it got ripped off on the barbed wire...

...we started calling him
One-Nut Johnson.

Uh, that's terrible.

Well, it could've been worse.

An inch to the right, and he would've
been No-Johnson Johnson.

Um, uh, you know what,
why don't we change the subject?

So how are things
with your girlfriend?

Pretty good. Gonna get some time alone
this weekend.

Her kids are gonna stay
with their dads.

Dads? Plural?

Yeah, well, before me,
she picked some real losers.

Sure, sure.

So, what's it like dating someone
with kids?

It's tough. They're pretty protective.
I mean, I'm the guy dating their mom.

Makes sense.

But her oldest son's pretty cool.
He buys me beer.

How old is this woman?

Back off, Dad, she's taken.

No, no, I wasn't- I-

You know what? I'll talk to you later.

- Okay. Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

Yeah.

She picked a real winner this time.

Check it out.

Whoa! You look like me
when I Photoshop my head on your body.

I've never done that.

Head to toe,
including undergarments, $32.

Whew!

Plus the haircut, $232.

- Nice.
- Oh!

Check this out.

Velcro, very classy.

- It's got a change pouch.
- Got the deluxe model.

I can't believe we went to the superstore,
you got a hot date and I got a root canal.

I didn't get a date.
Sam Wilson got a date.

- Know what? Switch watches with me.
- Why?

Sam Wilson doesn't have
a $50,000 watch.

Of course. Here you go.

Casio?

I had this watch in seventh grade.

So did I.

Okay. You know what?
We should also switch cars.

Yes, yes.
And you know what else we should do?

You should deposit your money
in my account.

Just trying to help you out, buddy.

- Thank you.
- Where are you taking her?

This Italian place in Santa Monica,
DiFilipo's?

Oh, you are in luck. I have a coupon.

- Buy one entrÃ©e, get one free.
- Sweet. Thanks.

And poor guys don't valet park.

- Unless they're wearing a red vest.
- Got it.

Wow. Fifty-thousand dollars.

What is wrong with me
that I wanna masturbate with this on?

Nothing.

For a man on a budget,
this is a little pricey.

Oh, don't worry.

I have a coupon.

Sexy.

So, Sam, tell me about yourself.

There's not much to tell.

Uh, I was born in Iowa.

At age 7,
I was taken away from my parents...

...and trained to be
a government assassin.

Intriguing.

Oh, it gets better.
It wasn't our government.

I only found out later,
they weren't my parents.

Which made killing them
that much easier. Tell me about you.

Well, I had a fairly typical childhood
in Riverside, California...

...until my parents were killed
by an assassin.

I've spent the rest of my life
tracking him down...

...and here we are.

- Gulp.
- Bang!

Well, the Riverside part's true.

And then I spent two years in New York
studying fashion.

- Ah.
- I came here to design clothes for the movies.

- How did that go?
- I designed this...

...and wore it to the movies.

So the dream is still alive.

Indeed, it is.

I gotta tell you, it's refreshing...

...talking to someone like you
for a change.

Someone like me?

Yeah, someone who doesn't
take himself too seriously...

...who's not trying to impress me
with how much stuff he's got.

So, wait, my coupon
didn't impress you?

Well, I don't have much stuff.

What you see is what you get.

And so far, I like what I see.

I like what I see.

Such a shame
I'm gonna have to kill you.

Too late.
I already poisoned your wine.

- Okay. You see the Big Dipper?
- Yeah.

All right,
see the last star on the handle?

- Follow that five stars to the right.
- Okay.

- Up three.
- Got it.

- Two to the left and down one.
- Uh-huh.

That's my star.

I got it for Christmas
when I was 12 years old.

- That's sweet.
- Yeah. Sure, now.

When I was 12, I wanted a dirt bike.

- Can't pop a wheelie on a star.
- Ha, ha, ha.

I'm kind of glad your car broke down.

Me too.

You wanna make a wish on my star?

I already did.

For crying out loud, Sam,
when are you gonna buy a decent car?

- Kate, this is my friend, Alan.
- Thanks so much for picking us up.

This clown rents a room from me,
suddenly I'm running a taxi service.

Yeah, sorry, my car is a piece of crap.

Of course, I don't do myself any favors
by never changing the oil. Ever.

Oh, I like your car.

Thank you.

Uh, so Sam tells me
you have a beach house.

I do. I do. It's gorgeous.

It was very expensive but I bought it
at the bottom of the market.

And then I sold it and bought it again
at the top of the market...

...simply because I can.

I'm sure you'll sell it again
and we'll go our separate ways.

No, no, no,
I'm gonna die in that house.

Oh, and that reminds me,
your rent is late. Again. Heh.

Right. I'll have it for you tomorrow.

Today would be better.

Fine, today.

He's a good kid.
Give you the shirt off his back.

It's a crappy shirt,
but he'll give it to you.

Oh, oh!

Would you look at the time?
It is almost 10:00.

I can tell, because the big hand
is near the big diamond. Check it out.

Yeah, it's nice.

Damn right.

So, Kate, Sam tells me
you're poor like him.

- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Me too.

But what's with this guy Alan?

Oh, I'm sorry.

He recently came into a lot of money
and he's not really handling it well.

Not handling it well?
He's a big, fizzy douche.

I mean,
the way he was showing off his car?

Jeez, how small is his penis?

Those two things
aren't always related.

I don't know, that watch is definitely
overcompensating for something.

Some people just like nice stuff.

Even people with really big penises.

Everyone likes nice stuff. But he didn't
have to be such a jackass about it.

I know. But, I mean, he's helping
me out, letting me live with him.

I get it. Still doesn't give him the right
to treat you the way he does.

- You should say something.
- Oh, I intend to.

You know, before he arrived,
I was about to do something.

So was I.

Come on, Sam.

Time is money.
And you're out of both.

You're right. He's a big, fizzy douche.

Hey, looking good.

- Where are you going?
- I'm packing a picnic for me and Kate.

We're going to a free concert
in the park.

It's a Van Halen tribute band.

Well, actually it's not a band,
it's just a guy named Dan Halen.

Unbelievable. You're having fun living
my life. I've never had that experience.

It's all because of Kate.
And the best part is, she likes me for me.

Technically, she likes you for me.

Which is ironic
because she doesn't like you at all.

- So, what's the plan here?
- What do you mean?

This girl's been dating Sam Wilson
for a couple of weeks.

When are you gonna introduce her
to Walden?

I don't know.
Hadn't really thought that far ahead.

I'm afraid to think that far ahead.

How long can you keep
this Prince-and-the-Pauper charade?

How long can you keep
living here for free?

Godspeed, Sam Wilson.

Well, that was fun on a budget.

We certainly got more bang for our buck,
didn't we?

It's- Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

- Oh.
- Unh.

- Oh, great.
- Everything okay?

Yeah. Alan wants me to pick up some
hemorrhoid cream on the way home.

Well, he is a pain in the ass.

- He's not that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

Then why don't we ever spend the night
at his beach house?

- He doesn't like it when I have guests.
- Douche.

- You should move out.
- I can't afford to.

Well, um, maybe you could crash here.

What are you saying, like, move in?

Yeah, just until you have enough money
to afford your own place.

That might be a while.

I knew I shouldn't have bought
that Dan Halen T-shirt.

So, what, we'd be like roommates?

With benefits.

Oh, I like the sound of benefits.

Good, because they include washing
the dishes and taking out the trash.

Okay, clearly we differ
in our definition of benefits.

Can I think about it?

By all means.

Okay, I gotta tell you,
you are a much better kisser than Alan.

Are you sure about this?

It's like Dan Halen says.
"Might as well jump."

- Well, when are you coming back?
- I don't know.

- Have you thought this through?
- I know it's crazy.

I gotta see where this goes with Kate.

All right, I'm just concerned
about my friend.

- I appreciate that. I'm gonna be fine.
- Mm. Good luck.

- And don't worry about anything here.
- Thanks, buddy.

- Bye.
- Bye.

Finally, you're mine. You're all mine.

So my porn name
would be Snowball Honeysuckle.

Ha, ha, ha. Oh, that is so cute.

I would download
every one of your films.

- What would yours be?
- Beebo 89th Street.

Guess it's not a foolproof system.

- Hey, I have to ask you a question.
- He was a fish.

Thanks, but, no. Um...

Why are you with me?

What kind of a question is that?

Well, just...

I don't have much to offer.

And a beautiful, smart girl like you
could probably get any guy she wants.

But I did get the guy I want.

Good answer.

- Just promise me one thing.
- What's that?

That we're always honest
with each other.

No secrets, no lies.

You got it.

- Good night, Kate.
- Good night, Sam.

- Kate?
- Yeah?

- I'm a billionaire.
- Of course, you are, Snowball.

Hey, you kids...

...get off my beach!

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

I am determined to find someone who
wants me for who I am, not what I have.

- I need to buy a bit of everything.
- I can help out.

I appreciate it, Kate.

- Not a problem...
- Sam Wilson.

It's refreshing, talking to someone
like you, for a change.

- Someone like me?
- Yeah, someone who's not constantly...

...trying to impress me with stuff.

- Kate, this is my friend Alan.
- Thanks so much for picking us up.

This clown rents a room,
suddenly I'm running a taxi service.

- You should move out.
- I can't afford to.

Maybe you could crash here.

- Have you thought this through?
- I gotta see where this goes.

- Promise me one thing.
- What's that?

- That we're always honest with each other.
- You got it.

I hope it's okay
I have people over on Christmas.

Just Jake and Lyndsey and my mom.

It's the holidays,
time to be with the ones you love.

Right, uh, and my mom. Um...

So, uh, listen, Sam Wilson,
how are things in Poorville?

Are you Les MisÃ©rables?

Actually, it's a hoot.

You know, last night, Kate and I
went shopping at the 99-cent store.

That place is amazing.

Did you know that
everything there is 99 cents?

Know it?
I registered there for my wedding.

Two cans of peaches, 99 cents.
Four pack of yogurt, 99 cents.

This owl-shaped mug? Ninety-nine cents.
Guess how much the wine inside was?

Uh, I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say 99 cents?

Seventy-nine cents. Dented box. Heh.

From now on,
I'm buying everything from that place.

Uh, not condoms. I think that's
how I ended up with Jake.

- Hey.
- Hey, baby. Uh, I gotta go.

- Hey, Katie.
- Alan. How are you?

I'm fine. Just, uh, sipping some wine
I got at the 999-dollar store.

Bye, Alan.

- Douche.
- Ugh. Don't worry about him.

- How was your day?
- It's Christmas, Sam.

Happy people, wishing you peace on Earth.
It was horrible.

Somebody's got a case
of the Grinches.

No, it's a case of nine-hour shifts listening
to Celine Dion murder "O Holy Night."

If I ever meet that skinny bitch,
I'm gonna beat the "O holy" crap out of her.

- And that's what Christmas is all about.
- Ha, ha.

I'm sorry. Tell me about your day.

After you left, I made some breakfast.

Oh. I got the mail.

I did some work
on that app I've been developing.

And then I did some serious
research on World War II.

- Really?
- I fell asleep watching the History Channel.

- Sweetie, can I be honest with you?
- Yeah, what's up?

I am working my ass off.

It would be really, really nice if you could,
I don't know, pitch in a little.

You heard the part about me
getting the mail, right?

You do understand that what
came in the mail is a pile of bills?

I think it is great you're working on your
computer stuff, but we need help now.

Okay. Say no more.

- I'll start looking for a job.
- Thank you.

- It's not like I expect you to make $1 million.
- Thank God!

Go ahead. I'm gonna go run a bath.
I reek of comfort and joy.

Hey, Billy, what's up?

Nothing much, just running our company
while you take some personal time.

Just man up and admit you're in rehab.

I am not in rehab. I told you,
I'm on a spiritual journey.

"Spiritual journey. " You know what?
I've been on four of those.

I still wake up craving meth.

I call it Eat, pray, love,
have angry sex with an Asian hooker.

- What do you want?
- Just keeping you in the loop...

...about what's going on here.
New computers in the bullpen.

We got a staple-less stapler.

Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy
the company...

...for 800 million and the redhead
in Marketing is not wearing bras.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.
There's a staple-less stapler?

I think we should take his offer.

Billy, we built the Electric Suitcase
from the ground up.

We've been here before. You hated
the fact I sold our last company.

I've come to realize
you were right.

I hated Tarnell, the gangsta
who sold me crack...

...but I was still happy to work with him!

Look, this is a good offer.
We should take it!

Okay. Tell him 1.2 billion,
but we keep control.

Do you think we're gonna get a better offer?

Bath's ready. Wanna join me?

I just got a better offer. Bye.

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day

That's the island greeting
That we send to you

From a land where palm trees sway

Here we know that Christmas
Will be green and bright

Jeez! You scared me!
I nearly dropped the champagne!

- Where did you get money to buy champagne?
- You left some for me.

- For emergencies!
- Yeah. We were out of champagne.

- So, what are you doing here?
- "What am I doing here" in my house?

Uh, sorry, let me rephrase that.
Great to see you, what brings you by?

- I'm doing laundry for Kate and me.
- Really? You did laundry?

No, I did laundry.

Thank you.

You're like some sort of kept man, huh?

I'm supposed to be out job hunting, but
it's hard since Sam Wilson doesn't exist.

I can help you there.

Five grand will get you a clean
social security card...

...and a new set of fingerprints.
Six will get you the fingers.

The fingers?

Better to have and not need
than to need and not have.

Hey, uh, why don't you just go to an ATM...

...pull out a few thousand dollars
and tell her you got a job?

That would be lying.

Oh, no. You wouldn't want to lie to her,
Sam Wilson.

Let me explain something to you, Alan.

Walden Schmidt lies.
Sam Wilson tells the truth.

Besides, I like Sam Wilson's life.
It feels more like...

- ...a real life.
- Yeah, I get that.

I mean, that's why I like to sleep in your bed.
It feels more like a real bed.

And get this, I got a call from Billy today.

We got an offer to buy
our company for $800 million.

Excuse me a sec.

Eight hundred million dollars?

- Yeah. We turned it down.
- You turned it down.

Check it out.

Oh, Sam. I hope you stole that.

- It wasn't that expensive.
- We barely made rent this month.

- I know. It's Christmas.
- Yeah. You don't have to tell me, heh.

I'm earning extra money by making
a Santa outfit for my boss's labradoodle.

- Aw, that's cute.
- Yeah.

Then I'm gonna make three
wise men costumes for her cats.

And just like that,
cute becomes creepy.

Okay, I'm gonna go change.

- I got a lead on a job.
- Really?

Yeah. If that doesn't work
I'm gonna rob a bank.

I hope the 99-cent store sells ski masks.

- Oh, man.
- What?

I forgot to give Santa a tail hole.

Worst Christmas carol ever.

Oh.

- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy. Excited about Christmas?

Yeah, that's actually why I was calling.
I'm not gonna make it home this year.

- What? Why?
- My girlfriend Tammy-Sue...

...asked me to spend Christmas
with her and her three kids.

I'm pretending to be Santa.
And also their various fathers.

Oh, kill me. Well, how did you
meet this woman?

I play softball with her parole officer.

Oh, dig me up and kill me again.

All right. Well, I hope I see you soon.

We'll all come visit as soon as
Tammy-Sue gets her ankle bracelet off.

That will be a magical day.

Yeah. All right, well,
Merry Christmas, Dad. Bye.

Merry Christmas, Jake.

Time now for the magic of bourbon.

Hi. I was here earlier. I bought a tree.
Uh, I was hoping I could talk about something.

If somebody told you
I'm selling pot here, that is just crazy talk.

Uh, no. I saw the "Help Wanted" sign.
I was hoping to get a job.

Oh. Have a seat.

You got any, uh, Christmas tree experience?

Well, I've decorated a bunch.

Experience, none.

It's selling Christmas trees.

Pop quiz, hotshot: A mom walks in,
she's driving a Lexus...

...she's got a big living room.
What are you pushing?

- Balsam? Noble? Doug Fir?
- Uh-

Bzz! You're out of time!
She's across the street buying a 20 footer...

...from the Armenian.

- Are you comfortable with celebrities?
- What do you mean?

We get a lot of big names.
Mario Lopez buys his tree here every year.

I don't want you getting all jelly-legged.

I'm young, I'm strong, and I need the money.
I'll work hard and won't let you down.

I'll give you 7 bucks an hour, plus tips.

- Minimum wage is 8.
- Look at my shoes.

- What about them?
- Where are they?

Under the table. Oh.

- I'm in.
- When can you start?

Right now.

A man with no life, I like it.
I'll go get you some gloves.

By the way, your cell phone's
like your penis.

When you're at work,
keep it in your pants.

Hey, Billy, I'm kind of busy.

I'm not in rehab!

Relax, Zuckerberg is not gonna walk.

Just sit tight
and we'll get the number we want.

I gotta go. Bye.

All right, here you go.

And, uh, by the way, if somebody comes
looking for a Jamaican Christmas tree...

...you send them to me.

Yeah, man.

I got a job.

As what, Prancer the reindeer stripper?

Nope. Selling Christmas trees.

- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

- Already sold nine trees.
- Nice!

I'm getting the stink-eye
from the other salesman.

He only sold six.
But the guy crushes it with wreaths.

Check it out. I made enough
on tips to get us Chinese food.

Ah, you really know how to take care
of your lady, Rudolph.

Oh, no, I don't get the nose
until I sell 50 trees.

Shall we open a fresh box of wine?

- No. No, no, no, no!
- Oh, switching to soda.

My sewing machine,
it just died on me.

Okay, no problem.
Sewing machines can be fixed.

It's gonna cost more to fix
than I'll make on this job.

Okay, it's not a problem.

Look at the bright side.
Somewhere in the world...

...there's a labradoodle and three cats
that get to keep their dignity.

I wish that made me feel better.

I got something
that'll make you feel better.

- Let's dance.
- What? There's no music.

Mm, I'll sing.

Oh, holy night

The stars were brightly shining

I love you, Sam.
I hate that song, but I love you.

I love you.

- Did we just...?
- Yeah, I think we did.

I got something else
that'll make you feel better.

Yeah?

- Let's get naked...
- Ah!

...and play some reindeer games.

- Are you gonna leave those antlers on?
- Oh, yeah.

Drive slow. Stick to the side streets.

You are a natural, kid.
You remind me of a young me.

Except you're taller and better looking.
And probably straight.

- Where are we going with this?
- Apparently nowhere.

- "Christmas" on three. One, two, three!
- Christmas!

- I did not see that coming.
BILLY: Walden.

- Hey!
- Or should I say, "Sam"?

Billy. How'd you find me?

It's easy. You told Alan you were working
here, you swore him to secrecy.

- I gave him 100 bucks, bam, here I am.
- Wanna buy a tree?

No, no. I wanna sell our company
to Mark Zuckerberg.

He has upped his offer to $950 million.

Wow. That's a lot of money.

You know, I can probably get you into
this 8-foot Cypress from Oregon...

...for 50 bucks off the sticker price.

Nine hundred and fifty million dollars,
we can buy Oregon!

Look at how uptight you are.

You should get a job here
with me selling trees.

It's stress-free.
Everybody leaves here happy.

Some people really happy
with a case of the munchies.

Walden, let me just call Zuckerberg
and close the deal.

You can close the deal at 1.2
for 49 percent of the company.

- I'm not giving up control.
- You're crazy.

- You are bat-crap, freaking crazy.
- I've never been so sane in my entire life.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a red blinky nose to live up to.

There's my Mrs. Claus.
- Hey, Alan.

Good news. My mother bailed.
She's having something rejuvenated.

Don't ask what. I did and haven't
been able to eat or sleep since.

Uh, Jake is with his girlfriend and her 17 kids.
So it's just you and me, kiddo.

I have some bad news.
I'm not gonna be here for Christmas.

- What?
- I have to go to Cleveland.

My grandma fell down and broke her hip.

Big deal, old people do that all the time!
It's like a cold with them.

- Ah. Can't your grandfather take care of her?
- He's dead.

Man, I can't catch a break.

- We can celebrate when I get back.
- Nothing says Christmas like January 3rd.

I'm sorry, Alan,
I don't have a choice.

I know. It's okay. I love you.

I love you too. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Sometimes she can be so selfish.

All right, I'm out of here.

I'm gonna hate myself for asking.
What's wrong?

All my Christmas plans have fallen apart.
I'm gonna be all alone.

Yeah, that's rough.

Happy holidays, Zip.

MAN Hello, thank you
for calling the suicide hotline.

All our counselors are busy...

...but your call is very important to us.
Please, hold.

- Sam?
- Sorry, babe, didn't mean to wake you up.

- How was work?
- My body aches. My hands are blistered.

I can hardly feel my feet.
It was awesome.

I wish I felt that way about my job.

Ah. Yeah. Your job's just a way to get by,
until you get your big break as a designer.

I've been getting by for three years now.
What if it never happens?

For God's sakes, I don't even
have a sewing machine that works.

But you got a boyfriend that does.

- Did you sell more wreaths than Jose?
- Ugh, no.

- That guy is a wreath-selling machine.
- Ha, ha.

He sold one to a guy without a door.

Aw.

- Is that mistletoe?
- It's supposed to be.

It's actually broccoli.

- I thought it'd be romantic.
- It is.

- You wanna...?
- No, hell, no.

Thank God.

I have no gifts to bring

Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum

I have no friends or life
Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum

Look at you. Drunk as your brother
and none of the charm.

- Berta?
- I got chicken and beer.

- You came back for me!
- All right, calm down.

- You love me, don't you?
- I pity you.

Close enough.

You got good taste.
Took home a tree just like this last week.

I don't know, 90 bucks
is more than I want to spend.

What do you think, sweetheart?
You like Doug?

His name is Doug?

His name is Douglas,
but his friends call him Doug.

You know what I like about him?
He's tree-mendous.

Daddy, I want Doug.

Oh, you don't want to disappoint
your daughter here on Christmas Eve.

Excuse me, Mr., uh, Tree-Salesman?

What do you want?
I'm trying to close.

So am I. I have Mark-freaking-Zuckerberg
on the phone!

- Is he at 1.2?
- He's at a billion.

Right now, think about that number.

You know how when you say
someone's one in a million?

You could have a thousand!
We have to give him an answer!

Tell him 1.2
for 49 percent of the company...

...and I'll throw in a wreath.
Suck it, Jose.

- What do you think?
- I'll give you 30 bucks.

- Seventy.
- Forty.

One point one. Don't make me
bitch slap you in front of this child!

One point two.
Sixty-five and I'll flock it for you myself.

- Fifty.
- Sixty and I'll throw in a stand.

You're not gonna move this tree.

One point one-five. You say yes
or I will shove that nose up your putzen!

One point two. It's Christmas Eve, Santa
needs a tree to put the presents under.

- Fifty-five. Final offer.
- One point two!

- Sold! Sold!
GIRL & BILLY: Yes!

Oh, you did it, you magnificent bastard!

Really? Him, not me?

Who is this for?
"To Kate, from Santa."

I have a horrible feeling
this breaks our $20 rule.

- Open it!
- Ah. Okay.

Oh, my God!
Sam, a sewing machine?

How can you afford this?

Let's just say I had a very good day
at the Christmas tree lot.

- You like it?
- I love it.

I feel kind of stupid
about the scarf now.

Are you kidding me?
You made this yourself.

This is the best gift I've ever gotten.

Maybe later you can sew me
a little tail hole.

- Merry Christmas, Sam.
- Oh. Wait.

Look what else Santa brought.

Broccol-toe.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

I am determined to find someone who wants
to be with me for who I am, not what I have.

You can be whoever you wanna be.

- I can help you out with that.
- I appreciate it, Kate. Sam Wilson.

Maybe you could crash here.

- Have you thought this through?
- I gotta see where this goes with Kate.

I think it is great
you're working on your computer stuff...

- ...but we need help now.
- Say no more.

I'll start looking for a job.

Hey.

Oh. Look who finally decided to show up.

Yeah, I got stuck in traffic.

"Traffic. " Pfft.
You were with her, weren't you?

Really, Alan?

I don't mean to sound like a broken record
but you're never home anymore.

I was there the other night.

All you did was watch the game
and fall asleep.

Remember how we used to
stay up and talk?

Okay, you know, fine, we can talk now.
What's on your mind?

Nothing, I'm fine.

I'm not a mind reader, Alan.

Well, not that you care, but I'm rattling
around in that big house all by myself.

I miss you. There, I said it.

I miss you too.

You got a funny way of showing it.

You do understand I have
a girlfriend, right?

So do I. Uh, another peach mojito, please.
What are you drinking? It's on me.

And by on me, I mean the money
you left me to pay the bills...

...which I used for other stuff,
so I'll need money to pay the bills.

I'll have a ginger ale, please.

Ginger ale?

My stomach's been bothering me.
I haven't really been feeling myself lately.

Which self would that be?
Walden Schmidt or Sam Wilson?

Sam Wilson is a lot of stress.

Thank you.

Money's tight. You'd be surprised
what that does to a guy.

Please. I've been so desperate,
I've climbed into fountains...

...and stolen the wishes of children.

So you get it.

I don't get why you don't resolve the stress
and tell Kate the truth.

- Unh. That's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

I don't know. Everything is going so great,
I don't want to screw it up.

Oh, that's not good.

I don't know whether this is beef or chicken,
but it's worth 79 cents.

What's the matter?

My life has been a complete waste of time.

Otherwise, I'm terrific.

Whoa, whoa. Wait, is this...?

Is this one of the dresses you made?
Why are you throwing it away?

Because, apparently, my stuff's not good
enough to get a job that pays nothing.

- You didn't get the internship.
- Nope.

Rejected by the guy who assists the guy,
who assists the guy...

...who designs Snooki's
signature line of baby thongs.

Don't worry. You're gonna get
the next one.

There is no next one.

I mean, obviously I don't have what it takes
to be a fashion designer...

...and at a certain point I just have to bite
the bullet and admit it is not happening.

But you're not at that point.

Three words: Snooki's. Baby. Thongs.

I think your designs are great.

You have to say that, I have sex with you.

True.

But if I was a woman,
I would totally wear this dress.

Hell, three shots of tequila
and I'd wear this dress.

- Ha, ha.
- And I would work it.

Don't make me laugh when I'm trying to cry.

Too late because I am fierce.

Ha, ha. I love you, Sam.

You have to say that. I have sex with you.

Yeah, the real test is, will you have sex
with me wearing that dress?

You get the tequila,
I'll go put on some heels.

Lightly salted, just the way you like.

Ooh, thanks. Heh.

Who could have seen this coming?

Right.

We end up with the house.

Unbelievable.

You know how I used to say
you'd have to pay me to hang out with you?

- Yeah.
- Here we are.

Hey, guys.
Mm.

Mm.
- Look who it is, Sam Wilson.

Alan, can I talk to you for a second?

- Oh. Sure. The principal wants to see me.
- Mm.

Oh, uh, Berta.

I brought some laundry by.
Uh, do you mind?

It's your machine. Knock yourself out.

So, what's up?

I'm transferring $100,000
into your bank account.

A hundred thousand...

Catch me, Lord.

I think I need to sit down.

I could swear that I heard you say you're
gonna put $100,000 into my account.

- I am.
- There it goes again.

It's like the Tea Cups at Disneyland.

How can I ever thank you?

Money's not for you, it's for Kate.

Next time lead with that.

- I want to invest in her fashion designs.
- What?

She's talented,
but nobody will give her a shot.

Are you sure she's talented?
This isn't just boom shaka-laka-laka?

I'm about to give you a boom shaka-laka.

A hundred thousand
will help her start a company.

- So give it to her.
- I can't. I'm Sam Wilson. I'm broke.

But you can because you're Alan Harper,
billionaire.

Oh.

Fashion's kind of risky.

And Alan Harper did not become
a billionaire by taking unnecessary risks.

You are taking an unnecessary risk
right now.

I'm just saying I would rather put my money
into gold, or maybe start a vineyard.

Alancrest.

Fine. When you make
a hundred thousand-

I don't have to finish that.

I want my money invested in Kate.

Okay, no problem, but I'll have to see
some of her sketches first.

- Alan-
- You want this to be believable, don't you?

Okay, fine. Have us over tomorrow night.

Unh, kind of short notice.

Alan.

Can't we do this at your house?

This is my house!

Awfully rude for a guy
who wants my money.

It's like you've never washed a dish
in your life.

What are you talking about?

There's still SpaghettiOs on this plate.
Ha, ha.

You're the one that wanted to be fancy
and said we couldn't eat them out of the can.

Ugh. Oh, speaking of fancy,
I saw Alan today.

It was actually
a really interesting conversation.

- He's looking for some new investments.
- He should buy himself a better personality.

Nobody's that rich.

Uh, but I did tell him that you're trying to start
your own fashion company.

Oh, Sam, you didn't.

But I did.

He's in a position to help you.

I don't want his help.

Unless I'm gonna start a line called
House of Douche.

Don't be ridiculous.
I'm sure that name's already taken.

Hey, he could be the answer
to all your problems.

I don't know.

Before you say no, he invited us tomorrow
night so you can show him your designs.

Really think he'd invest in me?

He'd have to be an idiot not to.

But he is an idiot.

True.

Give it a chance?

All right.

- I'll do it.
- Great.

Did I mention if you take his money
you have to sleep with him?

I'm kidding, I'll totally do him.

Ah, Sam, Kate, welcome to Alancrest.

- Why are you wearing pajamas?
- I'm rich, I can.

- You have a beautiful home.
- It'll work until my castle's finished.

Uh, that's French for, "Enter you."

Oh, look, my panoramic ocean view. Ha, ha.
You can follow my seagulls on Twitter.

Hashtag, gulls gone wild.

Oh, ah, delightful.
Thank you, Berta, that will be all.

Damn right it will.

Heh. She's been with the family for years.

They say you're not really rich
until you have servants who hate you.

- Uh, Kate brought her portfolio to show you.
- Oh, yes, Kate, please, uh, take a seat.

Take my breath away.

Oh, I'd love to.

I made some new sketches just for you.

Uh, she's been working really hard on them.
I think you're gonna like what you see.

Heh. No offense, Sam,
but look at the way you dress.

All right.

It's nice.

- Oh, I like what you did here.
- Thank you.

Capped sleeves are last season,
but okay.

I'm kind of done with rompers,
but I understand what you're going for.

Oh. Oh. Velvet. Kind of whorish.

- Excuse me?
- Okay, you know what?

Uh, Kate, why don't you run to the car
and grab some of your samples?

I think Alan would love to see them.

Yeah, sure.

I just hope they're not too whorish.

Yeah, let's leave that to Lady Gaga.

Ow!

What the hell is the matter with you?

Me? She's the one who paired an
empire waist with a Peter Pan collar.

You're supposed to be a simple rich guy.
Not a gay Bruce Wayne.

Hey.
You have your character, I have mine.

Well, your character
is a festering heap of human waste.

I think we both know if I had money...

...I'd be the biggest festering heap
of human waste that ever lived.

All you do is tell her you want to invest,
and give her my hundred thousand dollars.

Fine. But velvet is whorish.

Okay, here we are.

Uh, let's see. This is a cute little shift
that goes from day to night.

- I love them all.
- What?

- You haven't even seen them.
- I've seen all I need to see.

Kate, I want to invest in your
line of clothing.

- Really?
- Yeah. Tell me, what's our business plan?

It depends. If I had money, I'd put a show
together for fashion week in New York.

- That way I'd be-
- Great. Pack your bags for New York...

...because I'm gonna write you a check
for $50,000.

- What?
- What?

Sam, did you hear that?

Uh, yeah, I did. What's the-?
Fifty thousand dollars?

I know it's a lot, but I believe in her
and I want to take a chance.

Uh, if you really believe in her,
maybe you'd like to invest a little bit more.

- Sam.
- He's right. I'm gonna hate myself for this...

...but what the heck.

Sixty thousand dollars.

I can't believe Alan gave me
a hundred thousand dollars.

I can't believe it took him two hours to do it.

Thank you.

What are you thanking me for?

Because I know none of this
would have happened without you.

I just introduced you.
Your whorish velvet did the rest.

You are the sweetest...

...most generous, open, giving, caring,
genuine person I've ever met, Sam Wilson.

That's me.

Good old Sam Wilson.

This whole thing is incredible.
I'm so excited.

Me too.

- Are you sure?
- What do you mean?

Well, it just seems like, um, Little Sam
doesn't have his head in the game.

Yeah.

Maybe I need a minute.

Okay.

Do you think I'm fat?

Alan. Wake up.

What? What?

Walden?

What am I doing in your bed?

I must have been sleepwalking.

Relax, Alan, I just want to talk.

What's going on? It's 3 in the morning.

I haven't been able to sleep.

In fact, my whole life is falling apart.

I'm losing my hair. I'm gaining weight.
I'm all itchy and twitchy.

I haven't had a solid stool in a week.

So far you're describing
my typical Tuesday.

The worst part is I can't get an erection.

All right, just let me brush my teeth.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

- What?
- What?

Oh. Uh, yeah, you know,
I'm kind of half asleep. Yeah.

Wow.

Wow, that is a problem. Yeah. Yeah.

Has this ever happened to you?

Me? No. I have amazing control.
Watch this.

Got an erection.

Now it's gone.

Back. Gone.

- Are you done?
- Back.

Gone.

Look. Every guy has this happen
at some point.

It's never happened to me
and it's driving me crazy.

It's possible the problem
is not in your pants.

No, no, no.
The problem is definitely in my pants.

Look at you. The stress of living a lie
is causing you to fall apart.

- You're binge eating.
- I am not binge eating.

You get a free candy bar
when you buy four corn dogs.

That's just smart shopping.

This all started when you became
Sam Wilson. And I submit to you...

...that he's the one who can't pop
his weasel. Not Walden Schmidt.

Why don't you just tell Kate the truth?

I'm afraid if I'm honest with her now,
she'll just leave me.

Okay. Well, if you want your boner back
you're gonna have to tell her the truth...

...and trust that your love
will carry you through.

- Or...?
- Or you're gonna need a little help.

Go brush your teeth.

I'm kidding.

Yeah, heh, because that'd be weird.

Look, what I meant was...

...I happen to know a 65-year-old man
who'll give you a stiffy in no time.

Okay, that also sounded weird.

And it's back.

All right, Walden, how hard do you want it?

Redwood tree, tungsten steel,
or Chinese algebra?

I'm not looking to frighten anybody.

Really? I like eyes to widen
when I unsheathe the sword.

Why don't I just put together
a little grab bag for you?

I got one of those. I call it "boner roulette."
You never know what you're gonna get...

...but you're a wiener every time.

I'm gonna start you off with a couple of pink
ones, here. Good for a mid-week quickie.

And these green ones
I recommend for solo work.

Oh. This one I call, "Ouch. " Ha, ha.

That's her, not you.

Oh, the purple ones. I couldn't remember
where I lived for a week.

Knocked on every door in the
neighborhood, not with my hand.

And Walden,
this last one I'm throwing in here...

...just take half of it
because technically it's "only for horses."

Don't I need a prescription for these?

What are you, a cop?

Don't worry, Russell, he's cool.

Okay, well, there you go.

And since you're a friend of a friend,
I should read you the possible side effects.

"Headaches, dry mouth, blurred vision,
facial flushing, inflamed bursa sac, vertigo...

...fits of rage, homicidal, patricidal,
matricidal and suicidal thoughts, stroke...

...anal leakage, explosive diarrhea,
nipple discoloration, death...

...and difficulty achieving an erection."

Huh. That explains my yellow nipples.

You know what? Maybe I'll just
go with the basic little blue pill.

Suit yourself, Sally.

Here you go.

Don't want these to go to waste.

That little waitress down at Ruby Tuesday's
is never gonna know what hit her.

Sam?

What's going on?

Guess who's back.

Well, hello. I haven't seen you in a while.

Hi, Kate. I've missed you.

Okay, that's creepy.
I'm gonna stop doing that.

Good, because I can't stay and I wouldn't
want you to think it's because...

...I wasn't enchanted by your talking penis.

- Where you going?
- I came back to grab some designs.

I've got a million things to do
before I leave for New York.

But I promise when I get back tonight,
I'll make it up to you.

And you.

We'll be here.

Hold me.

Shut up.

Come on, we both know how this ends.

You sure you don't want a ride
to the airport?

No, Alan's sending a limo.

He's a class act.

I just feel like I should come with you.

Sam, I would love for you to come...

...but I wouldn't feel right spending Alan's
money to fly my boyfriend across country.

And it's not like you or I have the money.

What if I told you I had plenty of money?

I would ask why you didn't help me
instead of Alan?

That would be a fair question.

Honey, you are so sweet.

And hopefully one day,
money won't be an issue for us.

Hope you're right.

That's the car. I gotta go.

Good luck.

I'll miss you.

I love you, Sam.

My name is Walden Schmidt.
I'm a billionaire.

I love you too.

I don't care what your name is.

Hello?

Walden?

Alan? What do you want?

I'm just checking up on you, buddy.

I'm fine. Go away.

Are you sure? Haven't seen you in a while.

I tell you I'm fine.

- Why is it so dark in here?
- Alan, no!

Holy fat.

Don't judge me.

You didn't, by chance,
bring any nacho cheese, did you?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

I'm determined to find someone who wants
to be with me for who I am, not what I have.

- You can be whoever you wanna be.
- Hmm.

- I can help you out with that.
- Sam Wilson.

Maybe you could crash here.

I think it is great that you're working on
your computer stuff, but we need help now.

I get it. Say no more.

I'll start looking for a job.

Your job's a way to get by
till you get your big break as a designer.

What if it never happens?

- I want to invest in your line of clothing.
- Really?

Pack your bags for New York, because I am
gonna write you a check for $50,000.

The stress of living a lie is causing you
to fall apart. You're binge eating.

- I'll miss you.
- I love you, Sam.

Hello? Walden?

- Why is it so dark in here?
Alan, no.

Walden, what's happened to you?
What do you mean?

Okay. I don't know how to say this, um...

...but you're either wearing a child's shirt
or carrying a child.

Both options raise concerns.

Hey, I will not apologize
for enjoying the art of fine cuisine.

Says the guy who has barbecue sauce
all over his back.

Oh. Like I'm the first guy
to fall asleep on a McRib.

What are you doing here?

I'm worried about you.
I haven't seen you in three weeks.

Kate's still in New York.
Why are you still in her apartment?

I like it here. It's comfortable.

Besides, the beach house smells like you.
This place smells like Kate.

I'll take "Things a Serial Killer Would Say"
for 200.

You wanna be my next victim?

Come on, Walden, look at you.
You're a disgusting blob.

Can you even see your penis
past that gut?

My penis is like Santa Claus:

I don't need to see it,
I just need to believe in it.

You know what I believe?
Living a double life is killing you.

You don't know what you're talking about.
So why don't you just go away?

- You don't think you need any help?
- I know I don't need any help.

Fine, then I'll leave.

Alan?

Yeah?

I need help.

Oh, buddy, it's gonna be okay.

No, it's not gonna be okay.

I'm out of control.
I'm lying to the woman I love.

And the only thing I do more than lie
is eat raw cookie dough.

And I think I have salmonella.

Don't worry, Alan's here now.

We're gonna get you hosed down...

...back in shape
and feeling like your old self.

- You think so?
- Absolutely.

And after we do, you're gonna call up Kate
and tell her the truth.

- No, I can't.
- You have to.

- Why?
- The truth will set you free, and you know it.

Okay. Maybe you're right.

There you go.

Plus, it would be nice to lose the gut
and see my penis again.

And I'm sure he'd like to see you too.

Getting you back in shape
is not gonna be easy.

It's gonna be a long haul.

It'll take exercise, diet and discipline.

Don't make such a big deal about this.
I look fine.

Aw. Look who's got a little belly.

Let's do this thing.

Whew. That was easy.

- Hey, you.
Hi, babe.

How's the prep for the show going?

Oh, my God, everybody here is pretentious,
bitchy and high.

I love New York.

You're not Skyping from heaven?

Because you appear to be surrounded
by half-naked angels.

Oh. Yeah, that's Britte and Inga.

I guess they're done
throwing up their lunch.

Well, I've got great news.
I'll be there tomorrow.

You do realize they'll be dressed by then.

No, I'm coming to see you.

If the models are still there and we wind up
in a pillow fight in our hotel bed, so be it.

Ha, ha. Are you really coming?

Yeah, and I got a big surprise for you.

Oh. Wait, hang on a sec,
how can you afford a plane ticket?

Alan is flying me on his jet.

Oh, Alan's coming too. Yay.

Don't worry about him.
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

Oh, do me a favor. Before I get there,
make sure those models have clothes on.

How do you feel about
naughty-schoolgirl outfits?

I find them degrading.

And perfect.

- I love you, Sam.
- I love you.

So did you tell her?

No, I wanna tell her in person.

So pack your bags.
We're going to New York.

Me? Why am I going?

This is really scary for me, Alan.
I need the support of my friend.

- You got it.
- Thank you.

- Uh, Walden?
- Yes, I'll cover your expenses.

- Great. Um, and-
- Yes, I'll give you per diem.

If he ever gets a real friend, I'm screwed.

Ooh, you know what we should do
in New York? Go see a musical.

Yeah, maybe. If I put my life back together.

Of course.

So, what are you thinking, Jersey Boys?

Walk like a man

Talk like a man

I don't really have a preference.

You can't go wrong with Wicked.

Sure.

Then again, Mamma Mia.
Oh, I can never see that show enough.

I own the movie on Blu-ray.

Two words: Delightful romp.

You realize the point of this trip...

...is to tell the woman I love
I'm actually someone else.

Oh, I get it.

If that story was on Broadway,
I'd see it in a heartbeat.

Walden Schmidt in
Les Misrepresentation of Who He Is.

Thanks for the support.

Oh, come on, lighten up.

Everything's gonna be fine.

I just hope she doesn't like Sam
more than Walden.

Why would she?

A lot of reasons.

- One, Sam's better in bed.
- What?

He tries harder. He has to compensate
for all the other things he doesn't have.

He's banging scared.

If that's true,
I'd be the best lay on the planet.

- I just don't wanna lose her.
- Oh, you won't.

But it's fun to lose yourself
in the magic of Broadway.

- Alan.
- Fine.

It's too bad you're in a relationship.

Kate's show will be packed
with half-naked supermodels.

- Supermodels?
- Yeah.

Wow.

Excuse me a second.
I'm gonna make a call, heh, to my girl.

- Hey, Lyndsey.
- Hey, what's up?

I am on Walden's jet.

- I'm flying to New York City.
- For what?

A fashion show, maybe take in a musical.

Ah, guy's weekend.

Yes, exactly.

Um, so anyhow, I just wanted to make sure
you still love me.

Of course I do. Why would you even ask?

You know, I'm on a plane,
you know, anything can happen at any time.

Don't worry, Alan. I love you.

And we're gonna be together forever.

Okay, sweetie. I love you too, bye-bye.

Son of a bitch.

Oh, my. Oh, my.

Oh. Oh, gee. So tall. So very tall.

Oh. Oh, that's an 11.

And now we've got a 12.

Oh, God, can you believe this?
All these women, and I'm off the market.

Yeah, because that's what models
are looking for:

Middle-aged,
twice-divorced, broke-ass guy...

...who lives in a guest room
with a dehumidifier and my old tax returns.

Ooh. "I make enough money to pay taxes."
Rub my nose in it.

I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.
I don't know if I can do this.

- I feel like I'm gonna puke.
- Well, this is the place for it.

Grab a feather and get in line.

Sam.

Hi, Kate.

Hi.

Alan, it's so good to see- Alan.

I'm very, very happy for you.

I hope this show brings you
all the success.

- Thank you.
- Why don't I leave the two of you alone...

...while I fill my head with images to think
of when I have sex with the woman I love?

- I am so happy you're here.
- Kate, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

What's this big surprise you had
to fly to New York to talk to me about?

Yeah. The surprise.

Okay. Uh...

- Close your eyes.
- All right.

Kate, I'd like you to meet Walden Schmidt.

I don't understand.

My name's not Sam Wilson.
It's Walden Schmidt.

What?

ALAN
Walk like a man

Talk like a man

Walk like a man, my son

No woman's word

Wait a sec,
your name's not Sam Wilson?

No.

And I'm not broke either.

I have a lot of money.
In fact, I have more than a lot.

Like, think about a lot of money
and then multiply it by 10...

...thousand.

But how is this possible?

You worked at a Christmas-tree lot.
You didn't chip in on the rent.

I saw you use toilet paper as a coffee filter.

That's only because the day before,
I used the last coffee filter as toilet paper.

Okay, why are you doing this, Sam?

It's not Sam, it's Walden.

Okay, whatever your name is,
why would you lie about who you are?

Because I wanted to meet someone
like you.

Someone who's kind and genuine
and sweet and not after my money.

Someone that I felt like I had
a real connection with.

So to make sure you could trust me,
you lied to me?

I'm really sorry. I got caught up in it,
and then I couldn't figure out how to get out.

Trust me, you are the most amazing person
I've ever met.

I love you whether I'm Sam Wilson
or Walden Schmidt.

Well, good for you.

Unfortunately, I have no idea
who Walden Schmidt is.

- Kate, wait-
- You know what?

This whole time
I thought he was the douche.

Turns out you're the douche.

Unbelievable.

She likes me.

How you doing?

- I been better.
- I'm sorry, buddy.

You know what might cheer you up?

There are still tickets
for tonight's performance of Jersey Boys.

We're not going to Jersey Boys.

I totally get it.

Lion King it is.

We're not going to any musical at all.

Fine.

I don't understand
why we both have to be depressed.

I don't think she's gonna forgive me.

Why would she?
I mean, I lied to her about everything.

I don't wanna give anything away
in case you change your mind and we go...

...but when Simba lies to his friends
by not telling them that he's the Lion King...

...they forgive him after a few short
but snappy dance numbers.

Life is not a musical, Alan.

So knock it off.

See, that wouldn't have hurt so much
if you had sung it.

I'm sorry, I'm just upset.

I mean, I did what I did for love.

Am I really that bad of a guy?

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

You broke that poor girl's heart

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

You should have told the truth
Right from the start

But my intentions were good
I was no slave to my wood

I wanted her to love me for me

He does have lots of riches
Which attracts a lot of bitches

Thank you, Alan, but you'll never be on Glee

Oh, crap.

If I may throw in my two cents
Your love was based on a pretense

Your relationship with mother is to blame

You didn't suckle on her boobie

You self-medicate with doobies

- Explains why you used a made-up name
- Cue the refrain

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

Everything you said was a lie

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

But you still a really, really handsome guy

Thank you.

Then what am I to do
So I don't always live with you?

Wow, that hurts my feelings

But since I live there beneath your ceilings
I'll bite the pillow like the prison bitches do

Ooh

If she gives me one more chance
We can have a real romance

If she doesn't, we can party in my pants

Excuse me, no disrespect
But I have to interject

What makes you think
You can steal the show?

'Cause I'm gay

Oh, you're so clearly from L.A.
- Yes, I'm gay

And he will always be that way
- I'm gay

Or as his Jersey friends would say:

Hey, yo, bada-bing, he's a big old 'mo

Excuse me, but we seem to be digressing

And I find it to be quite distressing

Can we sing about the problem
That's at hand?

Can Kate get over Sam and love who I am?

You confuse me for someone
Who gives a damn

So bottom line...

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

And I'll die sad and alone

You're a douche, you're a douche
You're a big fizzy douche

Hold it, everybody, that's my phone.

Hello? Kate?

You're a douche.

ALL
Douche, douche, douche, douche

Douche-y, douche, douche, douche

Douche, you're a douche
Oh, what a douche

You couldn't say it meaner
I'm a big vagina cleaner

Didn't do what I oughta
I'm vinegar and water

- On this we all agree
On this we all agree

Oh, good, you finally see
To shining sea

Give me a D-O-U-C-H-E, douche

Give me a D-O-U-C-H-E, douche

Give me a D-O-U-C-H-E, douche

Drum roll!

You're a douche, you're a douche
- I'm a douche

Just a big fizzy douche

And that's all I'll ever be

You're a douche, you're a douche
- Just a douche

You're a big fizzy douche

And that's all you'll ever be

Douche!

Walden?

Walden?

Your phone's ringing.

Oh.

It's Kate.

Hey, Kate.

Yeah, I can meet.

Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay.

She wants to see me.

- Here, take care of the check for me.
- Will do.

Douche.

Hey.

Hey.

How'd the show go?

It was pretty amazing actually.

The buyer from Neiman Marcus
is interested in my stuff.

That's great.

About halfway through the show I realized
Alan probably didn't pay for this, did he?

No.

But if the models ask,
throw him a bone.

Thank you.

I'm really sorry.

Do you think that there's a way
that we can make this work?

I don't know.

I mean, I trusted you,
and you didn't trust me.

Now I don't even know who you are.

Well, if you think about it,
I'm really the same guy.

I just have a better watch
and a better car.

Better house. Better jet.

So nothing about you is real.

What's real is that I love you.

Okay, well...

I'm gonna need some time
to process all of this.

So you think maybe
when we get back to L.A...

- I'm not going back to L.A.
- What?

Yeah, thanks to you,
I might have a life here now.

Wow.

I didn't think any of this through, did I?

Apparently not, Walden Smith.

It's actually Schmidt.

You know what? It's not important.

So I guess I'll just wait to hear from you.

I guess so.

Goodbye, Sam.

It's Walden.

Hey, look who needs a ride back to L.A.

Ja, Alan the billionaire's got a big jet.

It slipped out
while they were running from me.

INGA:
Oh, too much champagne.

They are awfully pretty.

Yeah.

You, uh- You gonna?

No, I'm not interested.

Oh. Me neither. You know, I have a girlfriend.

But, you know, if we could,
which one would you choose?

- Probably the brunette.
- Really? The brunette?

- You want the brunette?
- Me? No, I- The aforementioned girlfriend.

Although Lyndsey is a blond.

The brunette would make
a very nice palate cleanser.

You know, uh, hypothetically.

Fine, you can have the brunette.
Hypothetically.

If we're talking hypothetically, it's my plane,
you're not here, and I'm taking them both.

Right. Are we done with this?

Hypothetically.

So I assume you're moving
back into the beach house.

- Yeah.
- Good. The place felt empty without you.

Oh, please, you loved every minute of it.

I did. I really did.

I gotta tell you, your bed ruined me.

And I ruined it.

Ugh.

I'm sorry, buddy,
you were gone a long time.

I'm gonna miss waking up
next to Kate every morning.

Mm. I'm gonna miss
driving your fancy sports car.

I'm gonna miss the way she held my hand
when we watched a movie.

I'm gonna miss the way
your underwear felt fresh from the dryer.

I'm taking the brunette.

.......... ********** ..........

Sorry I'm late.

I've been waiting here for over an hour.
I had to pee in that bush.

I shudder to think
what you used to wipe.

Did you knock to see
if Walden and Berta were home?

Yeah, they invited me in...

...but I decided I'd rather pee on my feet
while an azalea tickled my crack.

Actually, it's an oleander.

Probably not the salient part of your story.

None of this would have happened
if I had a key.

Oh, come on, we've been over this.

I feel like I'm overstepping my boundaries
with Walden...

- ...by asking if my girlfriend can have a key.
- I feel like an unwelcome guest in this house.

- I'm an unwelcome guest in this house.
- I don't think you're taking me seriously.

Isn't it enough that
you have the key to my heart?

Oh, bite me.

Okay. I get it.
You're upset and you have every right to be.

Why don't we just take a deep breath,
maybe open a bottle of wine, take a bath...

...light some candles?

Do you believe
I'm gonna have sex with you tonight?

I can't believe you ever have sex with me.

But you're here now, you look lovely,
you have an empty bladder. Why not?

You know what? Keep the key.

Oh. Lyndsey, come on.
Don't be like this.

What, you're just gonna mark
your territory and leave?

- Son of a bitch.
- Bet you wish you gave me that key now.

You're gonna keep doing that
until I ask you what's wrong, aren't you?

What's wrong?

Kate updated her Facebook status.

Still no mention of me.

Let it go.

She's eating a bagel.

- We used to eat bagels.
- Here.

Now you're eating bagels together.

I miss her.

Oh, boohoo.
I miss waking up next to Burt Reynolds.

What? It happened.

- Morning.
Morning.

Where's Lyndsey?
I thought she was spending the night.

Me too, but then she decided I suck.

Why?

- Did it take her so long to figure that out?

I don't know what happened.
It just came out of nowhere.

It always does.

You know who knew relationships?

- Your brother.
- Heh. Oh, please.

His lasted an hour at a time.

An hour and a half if he was drunk.

Exactly.
He treated women like rental cars.

You pay for them when you need them...

...and it's someone else's job to empty out
the trunk and hose them down.

Well, I'm not paying for sex.

And he can't afford to.

I don't need a hooker, I have Lyndsey.

You should lead with that
when you apologize to her.

We'll be fine. This whole thing will blow over
and be gone by tomorrow morning.

So would the hooker.

Hey.

Well, well, well. Look who finally decided
to grace us with his presence.

I needed some time.

Kate and I split up.

Wait a second, another woman left you?

She moved to New York.

Now it's- They're crossing state lines
to get away from you now.

Yeah, yeah, I'm a loser, I'm alone...

...and meanwhile, you're having wild,
crazy sex with my ex-wife...

...like I could never imagine.

Oh, you don't have to imagine it,
let me paint you a word picture.

Uh, the candles were flickering,
the music was playing...

...and she rode me
like I was a giant pink pogo stick.

You're not a giant anything.

Heh. That's funny.
You know what else is funny?

You're alone. Ha-ha-ha.

Okay, I get it.

It's a joke. Women always leave me.
I get it.

Well, you know what? It still hurts.
Not that I expect you to understand...

...how it feels to have your heart broken
by someone you love.

Because that would actually require you
having a heart.

- Do you even know how it feels-?
- She dumped me.

What?

Bridget left me.

Are you serious?

She said I was inconsiderate,
condescending...

...and that I looked
like a lesbian art teacher.

I don't know what to say.

Other than you do look
like a lesbian art teacher.

I'm glad that my pain can make you happy.

Oh, you have no idea.

Let me paint you a word picture.

Flowers are blooming, birds are singing,
angels are farting rainbows.

That's not funny. All right?
My life is falling apart.

Come on,
I'm just giving you a hard time.

I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay.

- No, it's not. I loved her.
- I know. I did too.

Then I realized she's the broken one.

- You think so?
- Of course.

She dumped me to be with you. I mean:

- Hey-
- Shh. It gets better.

Here you go.

We got chicken-and-stars soup and
grilled-cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off.

I got dumped by my girlfriend,
not pushed off the monkey bars at recess.

And that's why I put whiskey
in your sippy cup.

Ooh.

- What's going on?
- Oh, Billy got dumped by Bridget.

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

Me and my girlfriend are going through
a rough patch ourselves.

So she sewed you up in your sheets
while you were sleeping...

...and started beating
you with a broom?

- Uh, no.
- Then it's not a rough patch.

What is it that makes relationships
so difficult?

ALAN & BILLY:
Women.

Exactly. When's the last time
you were dating someone...

...and you decided to ask,
"Where is this relationship going?"

Or, "Are you mad at me?"

Or, "What's all this glittery sparkly stuff
on your pants?"

Guys ask questions that you can answer,
like, "How are we fixed for ham?"

"Why is my beer empty?"

Heh, heh.
God, I hate it when Lyndsey asks me that. Heh.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait, were we doing guys' or girls' questions?

On the other hand, there's no better feeling
than when you're in a loving relationship.

The sweet release of black tar heroin
is a close second.

The good news is neither one of you guys
is gonna be single for long.

- You've got looks and money.
- Thank you, Alan.

And you've got... money.

- That's true.
- What about you? You got-

Most of your hair. Both eyes.

Yeah, yeah, I mean- No- You've got, uh...

- You've got-
- To go apologize to my girlfriend?

BILLY: Yep.
Exactly.

By the way, how are we fixed for ham?

Alan.

Wow. Oh, um-

- Hey, Lyndsey.
- What are you doing here?

Well, I've left you a few messages.
I don't know if you got them.

I did.

Oh, okay. Well...

You look nice.

Did someone die?

- I'm going out.
- Oh, girls' night out?

- No.
- Oh.

Did someone die?

I have a date with Dr. Staven.

Wait, Dr. Staven, your gynecologist?

That's right.

Is this about the other night?
Because I said I was sorry.

Look, if it'll make you feel better, you can
lock me out and I'll pee in your bush.

Okay, that came out much worse
than I meant it.

Okay, I have to get going.

Are you mad at me?

No. We just have different ideas
of what a relationship should be.

Let's just sit down and talk about it.

Nothing to talk about.

Oh, yeah, right. Like a woman is ever done-
She's mad at me.

They're hot when they're angry,
aren't they?

Oh, Herb.

- Jeez, you scared me.
- Little trouble in paradise?

Oh, yeah, you know, relationships.

Wanna come across the street
for a beer and talk about it?

Oh, sure, thanks.

So, what are you doing over here, anyway?

Oh. Just seeing if Lyndsey's coming out
for her 6:15 jog.

- Oh, you jog with her?
- Nope.

Ah, you know, I don't think Judith's
gonna be too happy to see me.

Oh. Don't worry. She's gone.

Okay, when you say "gone,"
do you mean she's traveling?

Or is her head in that cooler?

She left me, Alan.

Oh, my God, what happened?

I had a moment of weakness
with my receptionist.

Actually,
36 and a half moments of weakness.

- A half?
- Judith walked in during 37.

Herb, how could you?

This is my receptionist.

I would have finished 37
while she was watching.

Thanks for inviting me over.
I really appreciate it.

Ah, come on,
you'd do the same thing for me.

We both know that's not true,
but it's sweet of you to say.

Besides, breakups are like a bruise...

...and I wanna be there when yours turns
from dark purple to yellow.

That is the meanest thing you've ever said.

Kudos.

Okay, here's a question:
Who's your dream schtupp?

- What?
- Any woman in the world, one night.

- Who's it gonna be?
- Oh, that's easy.

Kate.

See, right there,
that's why I wouldn't have you over.

Who picks their ex-girlfriend?

I mean, I'm talking any woman in the world.

- Okay. Dead or alive?
- Doesn't matter.

- Do I have to know her?
- Nope.

What if she doesn't like me?

For the love of God.
In the game, she has to like you.

Okay.

- Can she be animated?
- Like a cartoon?

You wanna be chomped by Ms. Pac-Man?

No, but I always had these weird feelings
when I used to see Bugs Bunny in drag.

Fine, she can be animated.

- Her place or mine?
- Who cares?

I do. It's hard for me to relax
in strange surroundings.

- You know what? Just forget it.
- But I didn't pick a girl.

Shut up. You ruin everything.

Mother Teresa.

What?

That woman gave her whole life
for the benefit of mankind.

One man should give her
a little something back.

Hey, guys.

- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hi.

Oh, Alan's girlfriend is taller
than I would have thought.

Herb, you remember Walden.
This is Billy.

Oh. Hello, Billy.

Alan tells me you got dumped
by Walden's ex-wife.

I got dumped by Alan's ex-wife.

I guess that makes us dump brothers.

That's- Who is this guy?

You don't recognize
your own dump brother?

Herb is the most recent victim
of Judith's unrelenting assault on mankind.

Oh. Sounds like just the kind of horrible
ball-breaker I always end up with.

She available?

Not emotionally.

- She's only physically available twice a year.
- Twice?

Birthdays and Valentine's Day.

Oh, that explains it.
My birthday's on Valentine's Day.

- I thought you were going to see Lyndsey.
- I did.

Right as she was going out on a date.

- Gut-punch.
- Yikes.

- With her gynecologist.
- Shut up.

- What?
- That man is a trained vagina handler.

You do not want him down there.

- He's already been down there.
- Yeah, on business.

You don't want him to return
on a pleasure cruise.

He could take apart and reassemble her
undercarriage blindfolded.

You're more like a guy trying to put
a bookshelf together from IKEA.

- You know what? I don't care. I don't need her.
- That's a good attitude.

Mm-hm.
- Exactly. Who needs women, huh?

- Not me.
- Me neither.

Know what we should do?

- Go to a bar, pick up women?
Yep.

All right, this is not gonna be that hard.

Look at us, we got a doctor,
a billionaire, another billionaire.

Billionaire's permanent houseguest.

Ooh, he said I'm permanent.

- Check out the talent at 3 o'clock.
Oh. Oh, oh.

Hotsy-totsy.

- I got dibs on the blond.
- Who's taking the manly one?

- What manly one?
- Herb's got the one with the Adam's apple.

Okay, what are we gonna do here, guys?
What's the plan?

I mean, teams of two,
every man for himself, shock and awe?

Or we can just send in the tall,
handsome guy with the big johnson.

- I'll see what I can do.
- Not you.

Pretty boy here.

Well, I am more than just a pretty face.

Come on, man, you could be
like the great white shark...

...and we'll be the plucky little pilot fish who
swim alongside you and feed off your scraps.

Why do I have to be cursed
with all of this?

Back off. I will seal the deal.

I've seen this movie before.
You're gonna enjoy it.

Ahem. Hi, hi. Hate to interrupt,
so I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.

I'm neither tall nor handsome,
but I'm incredibly rich.

So which of you would like
the honor of sleeping with me...

...for $5000?

I apologize. Ten thousand?

Gentlemen, the bar has been lowered.

This was a great idea, Herb.

We shouldn't call him Herb,
we should call him "Herb."

Well, as a doctor, I have access
to some pretty righteous chronic.

- You're a pediatrician.
- I prescribe it to the parents.

This would be better
if there were four hot women in here.

Yeah, and none of you.

Please, the only way you could satisfy
four women is if they were cannibals.

BILLY:
Oh, heh.

Yeah, look. I will have you know I have
no trouble satisfying multiple women.

In fact, that's kind of the reason I ended up
in this big bowl of sausage soup.

What do you mean?

Bridget and I would enjoy
the occasional threesome.

And by "occasional," I mean every
Friday, Saturday and Sunday night.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bridget, like my Bridget?
- Yep.

She was a weekend warrior.

Wow.

Closest we ever came to a threesome
was one time we dog-sat...

...and left the bedroom door open.

Me and that beagle made eye contact
at the most inopportune moment.

Well, hey, hey, hey.
One word of advice:

Do not look up from the lap of a girl
you just picked up at Safeway...

...and say to your girlfriend,
"My God, I never want this to end."

Eh, threesomes never work out.

Somebody always feels left out.

That's why my receptionist and I
got another couple and swing.

Ooh. String bean's a freak. I like it.

If you and Bridget ever get back together,
maybe she'd like to become a Herbivore.

I will keep that in mind.

Okay, so I lied to the woman I love
about who I am.

Herb cheated on his wife.

Billy spent too much time
yodeling in the wrong canyon.

- Why did you and Lyndsey break up?
- She wanted a key to the house.

And?

And I said no.

Why?

Well, it's not mine to give.
It's your house.

Since when does that matter to you?

Since I don't want my girlfriend to have
unrestricted access to my house.

And we're back to your house.

I like my space.
I wanna keep my options open.

Options?

You have "op-shun."

"Shun. " As in all other girls shun you.

Look, Alan, don't be a schmuck.

If you're gonna throw away
your relationship, do it for a good reason.

Like spending too much time
face down on the checkout girl.

Or fooling around with your hot,
young receptionist...

...who lets you wear a diaper
while riding her around the office.

Is one example.

Nobody's gonna think about that
next time we see you.

My point is, you're the only one of us
who has a chance to get his girl back.

What about not needing women?

We only said that
because we don't have women.

- Really?
- Of course. Lyndsey is awesome.

She really is. She's got the face of an angel,
buttocks you can bounce a quarter off...

...and a bosom that just makes you wish
she was your mother.

What? I'm saying she's awesome.

Just give her the key, Alan.
Give her anything she wants.

- It's a little late. She's out with another guy.
- No, it's not too late.

Go get her. Do it for yourself.
Do it for all of us who can't get our girl back.

- Yeah.
- Go get her.

Okay. You're right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it for all of us.

Oh.

I cannot believe he is our only hope.

Ah.

I don't know what the problem is.

This is delightful.

- Oh! Oh, boy.
- Alan?

Oh, Lyndsey. Lyndsey, hi. Hi.
I just need two minutes.

- Were you peeing in my bushes?
- What? No. No.

Hi, I'm Alan Harper.

No, thanks.

Alan, this is not a good time.

- Just hear me out.
- She said this wasn't a good time.

Get him!
- Whoa, whoa.

- Walden? Herb? What are you doing?
- You'll thank us later.

- Put me down. Who are you?
You look lovely, Lyndsey!

- What the hell is going on?
- I swear, I had nothing to do with this.

- Why did they take my date away?
- Don't worry, they're trying to help.

Help with what?

Okay, I know this seems crazy,
but I've been doing a lot of thinking, and here.

- What's this?
- A key to the house.

I want you to have it.

- Really?
- Yes. Yes, you're my girlfriend.

Mi casa es su casa.

Actually,
mi casa es Walden's casa es su casa.

I think I went to high school
with a Sue Casa.

Which is ironic
because she ended up homeless.

Sorry.
Anyway, the point is, the key is yours.

- What made you change your mind?
- I love you, Lyndsey.

What really made you change your mind?

All right, here we go.

The fact that while you could certainly
do better, there's no way I ever could.

Alan, that is so sweet.

And so true.

So I know Herb and Walden,
but who's the lesbian in the bathrobe?

Sorry about kidnapping you.

Aw, don't worry about it. It was never
gonna work with Lyndsey and me.

Outside of her vagina,
we have nothing in common.

Doctor to doctor,
can I ask you a medical question?

Is it beautiful?

Herb. Sorry about that, Dr. Staven.

Oh, please, call me Steven.

Steven Staven?

It's made me a stronger person.

You wear that robe
better than Judith ever did.

- Really? I feel boxy.
- No.

What was that?

Uh-oh.

Oh, crap.
- Run, Steven Staven! Run!

Oh. Wait!
- Herb's down.

Leave him!

Oh, dear God! Help me!

Tell Lyndsey I love her!

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

Long time no talk. I was starting to think
you weren't part of the family.

What? I'm not that easy to get rid of.

Just been busy lately.
Spending a lot of time with my girlfriend.

Please tell me it's not the 35-year-old
single mother with two kids.

No. Tammy's 36 and she has three kids.

Jake, she's almost twice your age.

No, she's not. I'm 19. Jeez, do the math.

How well do you even know this woman?

Enough to know that I love her.

Slow down. I'm not sure
you know what you're getting into.

You always do this.
You think every decision I make is wrong.

You're wrong about that.

You've already made up your mind
and you don't know her.

Let me ask you this. If you've never tasted
a strawberry ice cream cone in your life...

- ... how do you know what it tastes like?
- What?

My point is, you've never licked Tammy.

- I don't know how to respond to that.
- Yeah, you don't.

She's delicious.

- Fine, bring her up here so I can meet her.
- Okay, I will.

- Good.
- I've got leave next weekend.

- You know where I live.
- Yeah, someone else's house.

He's a dull blade, but he cuts deep.

Well, I've got Jake's room
all ready for this weekend.

Just out of curiosity, when are we gonna
stop calling it "Jake's room"?

Because I'd like it to be referred to
as "Walden's gym."

Or "Walden's home theater."

Or "Walden's room to do
whatever the hell he wants with it."

I don't mean to split hairs, but a room can't
really be both a gym and a home theater.

That's why I also need "Alan's room."

- TouchÃ©.
- Ha, ha. TruthÃ©.

- Will you stop futzing with my desk?
- I'm sorry.

I'm just- Ugh, I'm nervous
about meeting Jake's girlfriend.

He's obsessed with this woman. It's like
he's been brainwashed by some cult.

What guy hasn't?

I'm sorry, you said "cult."

- You're enjoying this, aren't you?
- Heh. I've gotta get something out of...

...you living here, you don't pay rent.

I think you're getting
all worked up over nothing.

- Nothing? She's 36 years old.
- So? I'm 34.

Yeah, and I don't want you
dating my son either.

Ouch.

- Must be them.
- Can't be.

Jake wouldn't ring the bell.

- Um, hello?
- Oh, hey, Dad.

Uh, this is my girlfriend, Tammy.
Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.

- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise. Come in.

Wow.

It would take the Jaws of Life
to get me out of this house.

Look, you already have
something in common.

- I'm, uh, Walden Schmidt.
- Good God, you're prettier than I am.

That's quite the grip.

Yeah, I milked cows when I was a kid.

Then I discovered boys.

I'm just kidding.

Not really.

- This really is an amazing house, though.
- Thank you.

Be much nicer with a home theater...

...but, uh, I've been very fortunate.

Yeah, so I've heard.
Jake tells me you're stupid rich.

He tells me you're very resourceful.

I'll take that as a compliment. Please,
make yourselves at home, have a seat.

Uh, is there anything I get you
to eat or drink?

Oh, I'd love a drink
but it would set off my ankle bracelet.

Not really.

I got that sucker off a week ago.

You hear that?
She just got her ankle bracelet off.

I don't see how this could get any better.

Oh, oh, oh!

It just got better.

Look at you. Heh.

Uh, now, where would a skull be going
that he would even need a top hat?

- He might be going to visit Yosemite Sam.
- Mm.

Yeah, they're kind of my business cards.
I own a tattoo parlor.

Did you hear that, Walden?
She owns a tattoo parlor.

That sounds fun.

Yeah, it's called Tammy's Tatties.

It makes guys think of boobs.

Thank you.

Speaking of which, in case you forget,
my name's written right here.

Nice. What's the other one called?

- I like you.
- Ha, ha, I like you too.

Everybody likes everybody.

So how'd you two meet?

- Jake came into my shop.
- Tammy's Tatties.

Once you get it in your head,
you can't get it out.

No, you cannot.

A couple of us guys went out drinking.

They bet me 100 bucks I wouldn't get this
tattoo of arms coming out of my butt-crack.

Like, you know,
someone was trying to escape.

- Oh, Jake, you didn't.
- No, Tammy wouldn't let me.

- Damn right.
- Thank you for that.

I took one look at his ass and I thought,
I don't wanna tattoo that, I wanna bite that.

Chomp.

- Hey, what's going on?
- Jake made pizza bagels.

I make them for Tammy's kids
all the time.

Is it breakfast? Is it lunch?

Is it pizza? Is it a bagel?
I'll tell you what it is, it's delightful.

So, uh, how does that work exactly?
Is, uh, Tammy's ex in the picture?

He's in some,
and in some his head's been torn off.

But was I right or what?
Isn't Tammy awesome?

She seems great.

But you have to acknowledge
that this is an unusual relationship.

I mean, she's old enough
to have you as her kid.

- So what? You are too.
- He's got a point.

Doesn't make any sense, but it's a point.

I wanna be sure
you know what you're doing.

That's the beauty. When I don't know
what I'm doing, she shows me.

Two-zero, Jake.

Face it, Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

Oh, baby, you got a milk mustache.

- Ha, ha. You ready to go?
- Yep.

- Where you guys heading?
- Gonna do a little shopping.

Pick up some souvenirs for my kids
and a new nipple gun.

- Nipple gun?
- Yeah, for piercing.

You give me a body part,
I can paint it, pierce it, or plug it.

- I really like her.
- Good.

- I wanna pick your brain, Mr. Moneybags.
- Go ahead.

I'm looking for a stable investment
for my pension plan.

Do you think Google's business model
is sustainable over a 20-year period?

Tell you what,
while you're out I'll Google it.

You're funny. Come on, baby.

All right. See you guys.

This makes no sense.

What? She's beautiful,
she's cool, she's smart.

Exactly. What the hell
is she doing with Jake?

Besides doing him? Heh.

- You're not helping.
- I'm not trying to.

Wow.

You ever get tired of this view?

I do not.

I've worked hard for it.

Good one.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

What do you hate about me the most?

No, I don't-
I don't hate anything about you.

Oh, please.

I've been in your shoes.

My 17-year-old daughter brought home
a 32-year-old guy...

...and I chased that son-of-a-bitch
out of the house with a gun.

- Oh, my God.
- Well, it was a nipple gun.

Which explains why I needed a new one and
also why I was wearing an ankle bracelet.

Hmm.

The point is,
I get what people think about me.

- But they're only looking at the surface.
- Well, there's a lot to look at.

Look, here's all you need
to know about me.

I'm raising three kids,
I run a successful business...

...and I own a three-bedroom house
that's not on wheels.

Anybody who judges me can kiss my ass
right on my tattoo of Brad Paisley.

I'm not judging you, I just don't understand
why you're with Jake.

I'm with him because I care about him.

I mean, he's sweet and kind and funny.

I don't know when the last time
you had sex with a 19-year-old boy was...

...but it is a lot of fun.

And eight minutes later,
it's a lot of fun again.

Um, I'll take your word for it.

Alan, has anybody ever looked at you like
you were the greatest thing on the planet?

- Do strippers count?
- No.

Then no.

Well, that's the way Jake looks at me.

He thinks I can do no wrong
and he worships the ground I walk on.

Uh, to be fair, for a while,
he worshiped Twinkies.

Heh, yeah. Yeah, he still does.

But don't worry,
I don't let him have sugar past 9.

Bottom line is I think your son is terrific.

I know what we have isn't gonna last forever,
but it's what I want in my life right now.

I'm really sorry if you don't approve.

Well, you have to understand,
Jake is still my...

...baby.

I hear you.

That's exactly what I told the judge when
he wanted to try my oldest son as an adult.

They're always your babies.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You busy?

I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

How about this?

It's just a bunch of ones and zeros.

Yeah, it's my favorite Gandhi quote
in binary code.

"You can never imprison my mind."

Why don't you just get one that says,
"I'm a nerd, don't sleep with me"?

Did you want something?

Yeah. I was wondering if you know
why my dad's being such a jerk?

Oh, dads worry. That's their job.

I'm practically a dad,
and I don't act like that toward my children.

That's because you respect your elders.

Look, your dad just doesn't wanna
see you get hurt.

How am I gonna get hurt?

Are you kidding me?

Have you never seen a movie
or heard a song or read a poem?

Uh, yes, yes, and no.

I think your dad just needs a little time
to get used to the idea...

...of you and Tammy being together.

Well, he better hurry, because tomorrow
we're gonna go to Vegas and get married.

That should be plenty of time.

Oh, you can't be serious.
Are you really getting married?

Yeah. I mean, assuming Tammy says yes.

Ugh, okay, you haven't
thought this through at all.

No, I totally have.
I've even started on our vows. Here.

I can't wait to start our life together
I like it when you dress in leather

I'll love you forever and a day
You make me glad I'm not gay

And you said you've never read poetry.

All right. Come here. Listen.
You're too young to get married.

- You got married at my age.
- And look what happened.

I lost my wife and half my money
and the only thing I gained was your father.

I'm not gonna argue about this.
Just don't say anything to my dad.

You can't do this to me.
I hate keeping secrets.

Don't worry,
I'll tell him when the time is right.

- When, after you get married?
- That's a good idea.

- No. No, you need to tell him before.
- That's not gonna happen.

- And you're not gonna tell him.
- Look, your dad is my best friend.

You're putting me
in a very difficult position.

Tammy put me in a difficult position the
other night too, and it worked out great.

Hey, why don't you just tell your father?

- Because he'll just say it's a bad idea.
- You know why? Because it's a bad idea.

Jake, get back here. Do not do this to me.

I just want a home theater.

Hey, dinner's almost ready.

I'm gonna pass.

What? You can't.
Jake's making gnocchi.

He's into cooking things he can't spell.

What's for dessert, cake? Heh.

Pie.

- Come on, join us.
- No, no. Uh, it's a family thing.

I don't wanna get in the middle of it.

Oh, there's nothing
to get in the middle of.

I, uh, had a nice conversation with Tammy.
She knows this thing with Jake isn't serious.

- Does Jake know that?
- Well, I assume he does.

Why? Did he say something to you?

Did he say something-?
Why would he say something to me? I-

- Let's go eat.
- I thought you didn't wanna eat.

I changed my mind. Like you did.
You didn't like Tammy, now you do.

Who knows what's gonna happen next?
Not me.

Oh. Quarters.

He's a billionaire,
he's not gonna miss them.

Jake, this gnocchi is amazing.

Yeah, I like to make it
because it sounds like "nookie."

- Get it?
- I do.

Not as much as I do.

So, uh, Tammy,
where did you learn the art of tattooing?

Prison.

Kidding. Juvie.

- Kidding? Heh.
- Nope.

You haven't even touched
your asparagus.

- I don't like asparagus.
- Why make it?

- You like it.
- Don't try to butter me up, young man.

- Eat your vegetables.
- I don't wanna.

Jake, listen to your mo-

- Arvelous girlfriend.

Look, just take a few tiny bites.

Do I have to?
It's delicious.

It really is. Did you know that
the asparagus plant, uh, dates back to ancient-

Jake's taking Tammy to Vegas
to get married!

- Rome?

- What the hell, dude?
- I told you, I'm not good with secrets.

- Baby, you wanna get married?
- Uh, no, he doesn't.

Yes, he does.

I can't wait for our life together

- I like it when you dress in-
- Nobody's getting married.

- We are. Because we love each other, right?
- Damn right we do.

- I thought you were just using him for his body.
- You said that? You're so sweet.

No, no, no. I am not gonna let you
throw your life away like this.

- Which one of us are you talking to?
- My son. The idiot.

Oh, so because he wants to marry me,
he's an idiot?

Uh, to be fair, he was an idiot
long before he met you.

I don't need you to defend me.

Come on, Tammy. Let's get out of here.

- Oh, Jake, you can't possibly be this stupid.
- It doesn't matter what you think of me.

But why the hell do you have
such a low opinion of your son?

Because I know him.

Could be worse.

He could be one of those showbiz kids
who goes off the rails.

All right, there's a 24-hour chapel
in Vegas.

If we hurry,
we can get there before it closes.

- Yeah, I don't think we should go to Vegas.
- Why not?

A wedding's about bringing
a family together, not breaking it apart.

Hang on a sec. You were just as mad at my
dad as I was, and now you're on his side?

I'm not choosing sides.
Your dad's a tool with a bad haircut.

I'm just saying, if we were to get married,
I would want the whole family there.

My kids, your dad,
the guy your dad sponges off of.

- Yeah, well, I don't want him there.
- You know, you're lucky you have a dad.

When I was 5, mine went out for a sandwich
and never came back.

- What kind of sandwich?
- What?

Sorry. We left in the middle of dinner.
I'm still kind of hungry.

Point is, I don't wanna be the cause of an
estrangement between you and your father.

Don't worry, my dad was pretty estrange
before he met you.

Okay, look, let's approach this
from a different angle.

Sit.

I think before we do anything else...

...you need to make things right
with your dad.

- He needs to make things right with me.
- It doesn't matter who takes the first step.

He loves you and that's not something
you can just throw away.

You're more important to me than he is.

Thank you.

But family's the most important thing
in the world.

That's why I make sure my kids
get to see their dad.

Even if he is behind plexiglass
wearing an orange jumpsuit.

I can't believe I'm not gonna be there
to see my only son get married.

If it makes you feel any better, I'm pretty
sure you'll have many more opportunities.

I got married in Vegas
and divorced in Reno.

Hell of a weekend.

- Dad, I gotta talk to you.
- Yeah, I need to talk to you too.

Um, I wanna tell you both that I'm sorry.

Um, that...

...if marrying Tammy
is the right thing for you...

...you have my love and support.

- We're not getting married.
- Oh, thank God.

Jake, I'm also sorry-

You're dead to me.

And your room's a home theater.

- What made you change your mind?
- I decided I don't wanna get married...

...unless you're gonna be the one
to walk me down the aisle.

- Actually the dad walks the-
- Let it go.

Right.

I just- I want you to be happy.

Thanks. And, you know,
someday we are gonna get married.

Maybe get a dog or a leopard,
have a couple kids of our own.

Maybe more than a couple,
maybe, like, two or three.

Thank you.

You're gonna need a bigger house.

You know, this place
could really use a home gym.

That's a good idea.
Where could we put it?

I've been, uh, thinking about names
for when Tammy and I have our first kid.

- You're enjoying this, aren't you?
- Yep.

Although I am a little worried about a
third generation of freeloaders living here.

What do you think about Walden Harper?

- I like it.
- No.

All right, then I guess it's down
to either Alan or Xiang Xao.

Xiang Xao?

Yeah, I gotta be ready, Dad.

They say one out of every three
babies born is Chinese.

I love it.

.......... ********** ..........

- Morning.
- Morning.

You by chance have the number
of a good chiropractor?

What about Alan?

Sorry, I couldn't resist.

- Is your back out?
- Not yet.

But I've got a big date for Valentine's Day.

If everything goes well, I'll need a chiropractor,
a psychiatrist and a priest.

I can't wait for this stupid holiday to be over
so we can celebrate something cool...

...like Free Bobblehead
at Dodger Stadium Day.

- What are you talking about?
- Valentine's Day.

Or what it should
really be called:

"Dumb greeting card chocolate-covered
overpriced flowers...

...can't get a dinner reservation
probably gonna die alone anyway day."

Sounds like Cupid's arrow hit somebody
right in the bile sack.

Don't even get me started
on that fat, flying baby.

- What could you have against Cupid?
- First of all, he's wearing a diaper.

Yeah, that's sexy. Then he's got wings,
which makes you think of angels...

...which makes you think of God,
which makes you guilty...

- ...about having sex in the first place.
- And in the second place.

Well, I, for one, am going all-out
for Lyndsey this year.

Really? What's that mean?

Cemetery flowers and a coupon for one free
go-round on Mr. Alan's Wild Ride?

I am sparing no expense.

Lyndsey deserves the best.
I'm gonna give it to her.

Well, if you're giving it to her,
it's not gonna be the best.

Huh. Wow.

- What?
- I just got an e-mail from Kate.

- She's in town, she wants to see me.
- Did she say why?

No.

Could be anything.

It could be nothing.

Could be something.

Could be something serious.
What if she's dying?

What if she's pregnant?

Wait, what if she's dying to be pregnant?

The woman I love wants to have my child.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father.

Advantage: fat, flying baby.

You have the number
of a good chiropractor?

- Kate.
- Sam.

- Oh, it's-
- I'm kidding.

Hi, Walden.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I got you your favorite coffee.

- Hey, how did you remember?
- Please.

How hard is it to remember a grande,
extra-hot, decaf, triple-shot...

...five-pump-vanilla, non-fat, no-foam,
whip-cream, caramel macchiato?

Actually, I switched to tea.

It's a joke.

Wow. You look great.

Success is really working for you.

Then again, you'd look great
with a bag over your head.

That didn't come off as charming
as I wanted it to.

Thank you.
I can't believe how lucky I've been.

Lucky? Come on, you have real talent.

I actually bought one of your dresses
off your website.

- Seriously?
- Yeah, I haven't had a chance to wear it yet.

I've been waiting for the perfect occasion.

So I was really surprised that you called me.

Yeah, I'm actually in town
for a couple of days on business...

- ...and I wanted to see you.
- You did?

Me too. I mean,
other than stalking you on Facebook.

Well, I wanted to give you this.

It's the money you invested in me.

Oh. Kate, I gave this to my girlfriend
so she could follow her dreams.

And I am paying back my investor
so I don't owe him anything.

So this is why you wanted to see me?

Walden, we broke up. When you break up,
you give the other person their stuff back.

Yeah, but it's usually a cell-phone charger
and a bite guard.

Well, in this case it's $100,000.

Well, I don't want it.
But I do want my bite guard back.

Buy another one. Or a thousand of them.

Kate, just put the money
into your business.

It'll help you get to the next level.

I don't need it.

I've actually found a new investor.
That's how I'm able to pay you back.

- So we're no longer business partners?
- We are not.

That's great. That frees us up to be
two young, crazy dreamers in love.

No.

Okay, how about two cautiously
optimistic adults sharing dinner?

- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Give me one more run at this.

Two old friends, chance encounter,
bus stop, sharing a bag of tacos.

Not gonna happen.

Too bad.

I was really looking for an excuse
to wear my new dress.

Hi, um, I am interested in doing something
special for my best gal on Valentine's Day.

Uh, how much is your presidential suite?

Uh-huh. I see.

Um, do you, by any chance,
have a secretary-of-agriculture suite?

All right, you know what? Let me just book
your best regular-people room.

And, uh, would it be possible...

...to, uh, split the deposit
over three credit cards?

Oh! Oh, sure, I'll hold.

Oh, hey, how'd it go with Kate?

Let's just say,
she doesn't want me in her business.

Financial or lady.

Oh, I'm sorry.

The only reason
she wanted to see me was...

...to give me this stupid check for $100,000.

You're not stupid to me.

- So, uh, what's the next step?
- There is no next step.

- It's over.
- What are you talking about?

She doesn't want anything to do with me.

Pfft. There's a good attitude.

Let me ask you something.

Was it over for Lyndsey and me
when I burned her house to the ground?

No. Was it over for us
when I introduced her mom to my mom...

...who subsequently turned her
into a rapacious lesbian? No.

And what about me living in this house?
Was it over when my brother died...

- ...and you bought the place?
- Sadly no.

Right. Because I am not a quitter.

And you aren't either.
You're Walden Schmidt.

Captain of industry.
Titan of technology.

Head honcho...

...of handsomeness.

- Ran out of steam?
- Yes.

But you noticed, I did not quit.

- Maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

Nothing is over until you say it's over.
With the exception of me moving out...

...which will only happen when you wheel me
into the assisted-living facility.

You're right, I'm gonna go talk to her.

- Thank you, Alan.
- No problem, buddy.

I will always be here for you.

Literally.

Oh. Uh, hello?

Oh, yeah, yeah, um, I have a MasterCard...

...a Discover card and my mom's Visa.

- Walden?
- Good, you've already showered.

- Now get dressed. We're going to dinner.
- What? No.

Sorry. Wrong answer.

The head honcho of handsomeness
rejects your rejection.

- Is that a title you gave yourself?
- No.

It was given to me by the man I live with.

- How'd you find my room?
- They told me at the front desk.

- They're not supposed to do that.
- Not supposed to accept bribes but here I am.

I am not going to dinner with you.

Fine.

You don't want to go to dinner with me...

...then we will have dinner right here.

Look, your favorite. A half-eaten lobster
with a cigarette butt in it.

I was really hoping for coleslaw
with a Band-Aid in it.

Come on, Kate. Go to dinner with him.

Don't be so shellfish.

- You know you're an idiot, right?
I'm a persistent idiot.

Let me get dressed.

Yay!

Why would I do that?

Oh, hey. There's my Valentine.

Will you be mine?

- Hi, Alan. Yes, I will.
- Great, I've got something special planned.

Is this gonna be a scavenger hunt
that ends in your pants?

Ah, no. This year I booked us a room...

...at the Bel-Air Hotel
with the full romance package.

- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

Uh, candlelight dinner, dancing,
couples' massage...

...followed by savage sex
with the man of your dreams.

Steve Buscemi's gonna be there?

That sounds amazing.
But how can you afford it?

A- bup-bup-bup.
Nothing is too good for my lady.

Besides, a month
without antidepressants isn't gonna kill me.

I don't know what to say.

You don't have to say anything.
Just pack your bag.

Your chariot will arrive at 6:00.

Yeah. Would it be okay
if we took my chariot?

- Why?
- Really?

I have to say it out loud?

I don't wanna pull up to the Bel-Air Hotel
in your piece-of-crap car.

Oh. Oh. Uh, we can use your car.

Oh, and if the front desk refers to you
as Evelyn Harper, just roll with it.

Okay.

- Well, I love you.
- I love you too.

Well, that went well.

Won't be needing these clues
for the scavenger hunt.

Now, wasn't that better than sitting
in your room all alone watching porn?

Is that what you do?

What, me? No.

I'm a bible guy.

Well, thanks, I had a really nice time.

Me too.

Well, good night.

- Uh, good night?
- Yeah.

Oh, I was hoping that maybe we could...

...you know, have hotel fun.

I don't sleep with guys on the first date.

First date? We lived together.

No, I lived with Sam Wilson.

Who you bear an uncanny resemblance to...

...but still, I think we should take it slow.

Okay, I get it.

Good night.

- Kate?
What do you want, Walden?

Oh, it's not Walden, it's Sam Wilson.

Go away!
- It was worth a shot.

- Morning.
- There he is.

- Come here.
- What?

Just come here.

Oh, what a lovely way to start the day.

Don't kiss me, I have morning breath.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome. What did I do?

You were right.

Kate and I wound up
having a great time last night.

- Congratulations.
- Yeah, it was perfect.

It was that same chemistry,
the same connection.

Mm. When you say "connection,"
are we talking "love connection"?

And by "love connection,"
I mean, "brown chicken, brown cow."

- No.
- No?

No, I didn't want to.

No, I just wanted to take it slow.

So we could connect
on a more emotional, spiritual level.

Huh. Sounds pretty gay to me, but all right.

- When you gonna see her?
- Tonight.

- On Valentine's Day?
- Yep.

- Ooh. That's a terrific day not to get laid.
- I know.

Hey, can I ask your opinion
about something?

- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

- What do you think of this?
- Dude.

What the hell?

Oh, uh, I did a little manscaping
for my big night with Lyndsey tonight.

I wanted to surprise her.
Uh, does this look like a heart?

- Uh, it looks great. I love it.
- You're not even looking.

- Come on, I had your back.
- Yeah, but I don't want to have your front.

Please?

Fine. But I'm gonna restrict my response
to only the nest.

I'm not gonna comment on the baby bird
sitting on top of the eggs.

That's all I ask.

No, doesn't look like a heart.

It-? It doesn't?

No. There's no cleavage.

There's no dip. It's just there.

What are you talking about?
There's a curve there.

The whole thing is lopsided.

Oh, no, it just looks that way
because I haven't fluffed. See?

No, it still doesn't look like a heart.

Fine, I'll keep working on it.

It's very difficult to manscape
from this angle.

- No, it's not.
- Uh, yeah, it is.

Okay, just for a frame of reference,
check out my manscaping.

Oh, my God.

It's beautiful.

I knew it.

So that's how you pay the rent.

Alan, come on, let's go.

I want to spend every possible minute
in that hotel room.

One second. Just finishing off
one last Valentine's surp-

Alan?

Oh, my God, what happened?

Manscaping-

Balls-

Hospital.

Well, I believe we just combined
Valentine's Day with the Fourth of July.

What do you say we throw in
Groundhog Day and do it again?

You know,
I had no intention of sleeping with you.

I even wore my granny panties.

Well, the joke's on you
because I like a sensible, full-coverage brief.

I really missed you.

Me too.

- Can I tell you a secret though?
- Sure.

Sam Wilson is a much better lover than you.

I'm sorry.

I couldn't get my mind off of Alan's penis.

Please drive faster. I'm bleeding out...

...of my scrotum.

Where did you get the idea
to shave your pubic hair into a heart?

- I read about it in a magazine.
- What magazine?

Marie Claire.

- Doesn't look much like a heart.
- Well, it's bleeding like one.

Oh. Oh. Oh, my God, this is the end.
I'm seeing lights.

You're not dying. We're getting pulled over.

Oh, nice job, lead foot.

Do you want to keep your other ball?

Evening. Do you know why
I pulled you over?

I was speeding,
but I have a very good excuse.

- Is that so?
- Show him, Alan.

What? No.

Show him.

Oh, sweet mother of God.

Is that a heart?

Thank you.

- Oh, my God.
- What? Alan, no.

- What's going on?
- You're not gonna believe this.

My business partner just found a factory.

We can start production on my line
immediately.

That's great.

Congratulations.

Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

We leave for China tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

Oh, you know what? Wait.

I'm gonna be in Japan
in two weeks on business.

I could hop over to China. We could get some
Kung Pao chicken, maybe adopt a baby.

Aw, Kung Pao chicken is such a commitment.

Oh, wait, in two weeks I have to be back here.

Okay. Oh, how about the week of the 10th?
I have a tech conference in Austin.

- You could come with me.
- Let me check.

I don't know if you've been
to a tech conference.

Picture a comic-book convention
with nerdier guys.

You would be their queen.

No, that won't work.

- How about first week in May?
- I can do the second.

And I can't.

This was a lot easier
when we were both broke.

It was.

How about this?

Are you free for sex in 30 seconds?

I have an opening.

Let me check.

Well, I'll have to move a few things
around, but yes, I am.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- How you doing?
- I'm high, humiliated and hairless.

- Sorry I ruined Valentine's Day.
- What are you talking about?

Well, I wanted it to be special...

...because, you know,
I haven't always been the best boyfriend...

...or even a good boyfriend.

Or even an adequate boyfr-

Feel free to stop me at any time.

I'm just teasing you.

The fact that you even tried
means everything to me.

- Really?
- Really.

And driving 95 miles an hour
behind a police escort?

Best Valentine's Day ever.

You know, uh, we could pull this curtain.

Seriously?

They just put ten stitches in your junk.

I thought we could take advantage
of the swelling.

Okay.

You ready?

Ow. Ow, ow.

Ow. Don't stop.

Ow. Ahh!

I know I'm gonna regret asking this.

How's your ball?

Throbbing and green.

So, what's going on with you and Kate?

I don't know.

It's gonna be hard to make
a relationship work with her traveling.

That's rough.

Not "tetanus shot in your sack" rough, but...

Hey, how's she affording all this?

She's got some new investor
with a lot of money.

- That's nice.
- Except I don't know...

...if I'm ever gonna see her again.

If you don't leave it alone, it'll never heal.

If you don't stop doing that,
I'm gonna make you wear a cone around it.

What a stroke of luck,
you finding that factory in China.

I know.

Sometimes fate steps in
and makes things happen.

I'm not gonna lie,
I wish the timing were better.

Well, if he really loves you, he'll wait for you.

How did you know I have a boyfriend?

Oh, a pretty girl like you?
You'd have to have a boyfriend.

He's amazing. I'm crazy about him.

Been there.

.......... ********** ..........

Hi, future me.

This is 17-year-old you
in your dorm room at MIT.

Yeah, that's right.
I did my own Pop Up Video.

How cool is that?

Still is.

Hopefully you're watching this
from your implanted brain chip...

...a.k.a. the Tran Schmidter...

...running proprietary software
developed by Walden Schmidt Enterprises.

Failing that,
hopefully you've at least seen a girl naked.

Hey, what you watching?

Check this out. I had all my old videotapes
digitized and I found this.

Oh, my God. Is that you?

You were nothing more than an awkward,
pimply-faced, goofy-looking teenager.

We would've been best friends.

Yeah, I made it when I was at MIT.

It outlines everything I wanted to accomplish
by the time I turned 35.

I did a similar thing.

It wasn't so much a video
as something I wrote on a cocktail napkin.

"Don't kill yourself. It'll get better."

I was so naive.

I hope you've accomplished your first goal,
as previously stated, of seeing a girl naked...

...and I'm talking in person.

Which I did a short 18 months later.

Goal number two:

Create your own software company
to revolutionize the industry standard...

...for information transferal
at blinding speeds.

Hear that? Fifty-six K dial-up.

In four hours, I will have downloaded
the entire Spice Girls album.

After building your company
from the ground up...

...you will sell it for:

$1 million.

Well, that didn't happen.

I sold it for:

$1 billion.

Yeah, baby.

Don't. Just don't.

Number three:
Live in a beautiful beach house...

Nailed it.

...with the love of your life.

Nailed it.

Although, it is kind of hard
to meet someone...

...when you spend 20 hours a day
in the computer lab.

Phyllis is now Phil.
He's a commercial fisherman in Baton Rouge.

But I'm sure all this hard work
will be worth it someday...

...when you're watching this video
with your beautiful wife, four kids, two dogs...

...and robot butler,
developed by Walden Schmidt Enterprises.

"Hello, Walden. Would you like a root beer?"

Heck, yeah.

Where did my life take such a wrong turn?

What are you talking about?

I don't have any of those things that matter.
No wife, no kids.

All I have is you.

Well...

...we could adopt.

- watching this video
with your beautiful wife, four kids, two dogs...

...and robot butler,
developed by...

Hey.

Oh, hey. What are you doing up?

Alan is sleep-sobbing again.

You still watching this thing?

I'm a failure, Lyndsey.

No, you're not, Walden.

Although you looked like one in college.

I kind of did.

I mean, I wouldn't have slept with you
and I slept with everybody.

- Got it.
- I even slept with the janitor in my dorm.

This supposed to cheer me up?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Look, when I was 18...

...I was convinced I was gonna marry Axl Rose
and have my own TV show.

Well, they don't give TV shows to people
just because they're good-looking.

Just because your life didn't turn out the way
you thought, doesn't mean it's not a success.

I mean, how many people can say
they're a billionaire?

One thousand, two hundred and twenty-six.

Seriously?

That's a lot more than I thought.

- Do you know them all?
- There's not a club or anything.

But Buffett does host a poker game
once a month.

Last time I won Guatemala.

Wow.

But then I lost it again
to the woman who invented Spanx.

Money doesn't mean anything
if I don't have anyone to share it with.

Oh, I get that.

But you're not gonna meet anybody
sitting on your couch feeling sorry for yourself.

Are you?

- I guess not.
- Damn.

- I just don't get relationships.
- Nobody does.

They're scary and messy.

Sometimes you get involved with somebody
you don't really like.

And one day you find yourself
peeing on a stick.

Then the plus sign shows up and you give up
your dreams of being an actress...

...so you can raise a kid who can only do math
when figuring out the cost of weed.

Pep talks really aren't your strong suit,
are they?

I'm just saying that things happen,
but you can't give up.

I mean, if I'd stopped looking...

...I never would've found my amazing,
wonderful boyfriend.

You're cheating on Alan?

Hey, would you eat expired pudding?

- No.
- Oh, good. Then I can have it.

Knock yourself out.

What you doing?

I'm looking for this card, and I can't-
There it is.

"Emily's Elite and Discreet Introductions."

Oh. Fancy call girls. I like it.

No, it's a dating service.

Heh, right, "dating service. " Wink, wink.

You know, I want to like you,
but sometimes you make it so hard.

"Substantial relationships
for substantial people."

Ah. Big girls.

Get your smoosh on.

- They throw mixers for single rich people.
- Wouldn't think you'd be into that kind of thing.

- You've always been a fate kind of guy.
- I'm gonna create my own fate.

Lyndsey's right. Not gonna find anyone
sitting around here feeling sorry for myself.

No, you're not.

Are you?

- What?
- Nothing.

Hey, can I go along?

- What? No, you have Lyndsey.
- I'd be doing it for her.

Look, I'll find a rich 90-year-old woman
with a bad ticker...

...give her the best three minutes of her life
and then, you know, send her out with a bang.

Then spend my inheritance on Lyndsey.

Or whatever's left after my grief cruise.

Again, you make it really hard to like you.

I just want a sugar mama.

You have one. Her name is Walden.

Walden, we have a great mixer tonight. I hope
you're ready to meet some substantial women.

Yep, I'm ready to get my smoosh on.

I'm sor- I'm just really nervous.

Don't be. Everyone here is rich
and looking for love.

The only woman in this room
who wants you for your money is me.

- Happy mingling.
- Okay.

- Hello.
- Hello.

- Trust fund or tech?
- Excuse me?

Way you're dressed means you're either
the beneficiary of a trust fund or in tech.

Unless you're working here,
in which case I need another drink.

Actually I'm in tech.
I started my own company when I was-

Your Fridays?

Uh, a lot like my Thursdays, just one day later.

A sense of humor.
Some people find that attractive.

Are you one of them?

I love to laugh. Now, I've got Friday evenings,
Sunday afternoons and ski season.

How does that work for you?

Don't you wanna at least know my name?

Really?

Do we have to do all this?

All right. I'm Sylvia Miller. I'm the CEO
of a major pharmaceutical company.

Wow, very impressive.

Yes. Every time you get an erection,
you owe me $10.

See? Sense of humor.
Now, Fridays and Sundays...

I thought we could spend time
getting to know each-

Nice talking to you.

Okay, I'll put her on the "maybe" pile.

Hi, how you doing?

Oh, hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.

Nice to meet you. TC Randall.

You're the TC Randall?

Author of
Throgwarten Middle School Mysteries?

- I've read all your books.
- Really?

Yeah, who hasn't?

Grown men.

- Their loss. I mean, you're an amazing author.
- Thank you.

Oh, you know,
I do have one question, though.

In book three, the dragons inexplicably
lose their ability to breathe fire...

...when clearly in book two
the wizards gave them that ability.

Was that a setup for book four
or an oversight?

They're children's books.

Well, it says on the cover they're for wizards,
dragon trainers and kids of all ages.

Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

The dragons lost their ability to breathe fire
in the Caverns of Chaos.

Aw. Come on, they didn't even go
to the Caverns of Chaos...

...until they solved the mystery
of the missing map.

All right, you know what?

When I wrote those books,
I was addicted to painkillers.

They make no sense, but they make me
a ton of money, so cut me some slack.

Probably got the painkillers
from the pharmaceutical chick.

- So any luck so far?
- No, not yet.

Well, don't worry,
there are plenty of women here.

How about them?

Sarah's oil money,
Stephanie is a tobacco heiress...

...and Amy had sex with a senator
and owns the video.

- Oh, my God.
- I don't care how, I care how much.

No, the woman in the green dress.

- I used to be married to her.
- Oh.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I try to avoid situations like this.

No, you know what? It's fine.
I'll just go say hello.

Sure. What's the worst that can happen?

She's already got half your money.

Bridget?

Walden? What are you doing here?

Just drinking a beer, losing faith in humanity,
planning to die alone.

I get it. These people are awful.

The last guy I talked to
offered to give me a boob job.

- A plastic surgeon?
- Unfortunately no.

So you haven't met anyone either?

No, I'm actually thinking about
going next door.

The Goldberg bar mitzvah
seems like it's going off.

Mm. Good luck.
I hope you find what you're looking for.

So did I find what I was looking for?

Oh, yeah.

- So...
- Yeah.

That happened.

- Twice.
- Three for me.

- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

The third time I thought you were screaming
just because I was on your hair.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

What does this mean?

It means we both paid $1000
to meet someone we already slept with.

Wait, you paid $1000? I paid 2000.

Ha, ha.
Looks like you got screwed a lot tonight.

The answer is, I don't know what it means.

- I just know it feels right.
- It does.

Which is odd, because we just did
a couple things that were very, very wrong.

So how do we make sure we don't end up
where we were before?

Well, everything that happened before
was your fault, so it's kind of up to you.

I'm a different person than I was
when we split up.

That's good, because towards the end
I felt more like your mother than your wife.

You are a much better kisser than my mom.

So are you.

The truth is, I've grown up a lot since then.

I don't need anyone to take care of me.

I don't have to check under the bed
for monsters?

Of course not. Alan does that.

Does Alan do this?

Yes.

Well...

He does not do that.

I can't believe you guys are back together.

Walden and Bridget. Bridget and Walden.

And Alan.

The Three Musketeers.

- Or three's a crowd.
- Or Three's Company.

Or three strikes and you're out.

Okay, okay. Let's play nice.

Sorry.

So, Bridget, after you and Walden broke up...

...didn't you immediately start dating
his best friend and business partner, Billy?

I did. But in hindsight, I realize it was
just a pathetic attempt to stay close to Walden.

You know what that's like, don't you, Alan?

All right, that was a good one.

What are you eating?

Oh. It's a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich
with pancakes as the bread.

I call it a McWalden.

I call it a McBypass.

It has all the basic food groups.

Protein, dairy...

...syrup.

If you don't eat properly,
your immune system can't do its job.

- I have had more colds this year.
- See?

I'm gonna pour you a glass
of fresh orange juice to wash that down.

- She's doing it again.
- What?

Telling you what to do.

She just cares about me.

- Meow, wa-psh!
- Shut up.

Here you go.

- I think you're all done with that.
- Actually I was not-

BRIDGET: Drink your juice.
- Okay.

When you're done,
I want you to go upstairs and make your bed.

- But Berta does it.
BRIDGET: No buts.

Okay.

Run.

I'm so glad that we found each other again.

Me too.

- Mm.
- I wanna try something.

Whatever it is, I am in.

It's pretty extreme.

Yay.

- Are you ready to have your mind blown?
- Among other things.

Let's...

...wait.

For what?

Let's not have sex tonight.

Let's wait.

I'm not sure that I follow.

Imagine how much deeper we could connect
on an emotional level...

...if we weren't prisoners of our pelvis.

But I like that prison.

I just don't wanna be in solitary.

I'm serious, Walden. I want sex to be more
than just a physical release.

I want it to be a special event.

Okay, are we talking special event like...

...Monday Night Football...

...or special event like Halley's Comet?

I'll let you know.

But in the meantime,
there's other stuff we could do.

Ohh, I like other stuff.
What do you have in mind?

We can cuddle.

Cuddle?

I think it would really help us connect.
Let's try it.

- See? Isn't this nice?
- Mm. Mm.

This is so much better
than having nasty old sex.

So how do we know when we're done?

BRIDGET:
There you are, Alan.

Come, join us, please.

Oh, this can't be good.

So, what's going on?

Walden.

Um...

First, I would like to say...

...that I appreciate
what a great friend you are.

Thank you?

Which makes it hard for me-

Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

- Bridget feels that-
BRIDGET: Ahem.

We feel that you living here...

...is no longer beneficial
to the goals of this household.

Bye-bye.

Fine, fine. Let me just say one thing.

When you broke up the first time,
it's because Bridget thought you were a child.

Turns out, she's the one who keeps you a child
by controlling everything you do.

Na-uh.

Mark my words,
next she'll start withholding sex.

You'll be like a dog begging for a bone.

Or a dog with a bone.
Either way, a bone will be involved.

Why is Zippy so upset?

Walden asked him to move out.

Ha-ha-ha. It's about time.

- Hey, Berta?
- Yeah?

Um, why don't you have a seat?

Oh, crap.

- Hi, sleepyhead.
- Hi.

Isn't this nice? Just the two of us?

I'm a little groggy. What happened?

I have a little surprise for you.

Oh.

What is it?

My balls?

No, sweetie. My balls.

- How'd it go with your ex-wife?
- It was a nightmare.

Hello, future Alan Harper.

It's you from the past,
outlining my goals for the next 50 years.

I hope this finds you
still on this comfortable couch...

...in this lovely beach house...

...hopefully with Walden,
or whoever moves in after him.

Nailed it.

What?

I said, "Nailed it."

If you want coffee,
go make coffee.

Buffalo.

.......... ********** ..........

Hey, Lyndsey, just calling
to say good night.

Oh. Oh, you're in bed already. Heh.

So, uh, what are you wearing?

Really? What kind of sweatpants?

Ooh. Big, old gray ones.

Is it just me,
or are you getting turned on too?

It's just me?

Well, that's fine.
I do some of my best work alone.

All right, all right. Go to sleep.

I love you. Do you love-?

I know she does.

Oh, great.

Uh-oh. Uh...

Oh! Oh.

No, no, no!

No, I can't burn down another house!

Alan?

Oh, hi. Uh, um... Just making some toast.

Huh. Wonder what happened.

- Morning.
- Hey.

Sorry again about last night. Heh.

Sorry about what?

The fact that my date and I
came home last night...

...to find a middle-aged man
spraying water all over my kitchen...

...in his tighty-not-so-whities?

I was putting out a fire.

I'm a hero.

Really? Because it looked like
you were posing...

...for the World's Most
Disturbing Firemen calendar.

Okay, okay, I get it.
You're a little upset.

But I have something
that will make you feel better.

Ta-da.

I went out to the drugstore and bought you
a new toaster to replace the old one.

The other one was better.

Better? Heh.
This is the Toastmaster Deluxe.

This is the best thing to happen
to sliced bread since sliced bread.

But mine had glass walls, so you could
watch the toast turn tropical brown.

It was like a little bread tanning booth.

Well, check this out.
You know, light, dark.

Dark, light. Uh...

Okay, that's, uh...

That's supposed to happen.
That's actually a safety feature.

You know,
common courtesy dictates...

...that if you're gonna use my stuff
and break my stuff...

...that you replace my stuff
with equally awesome stuff.

This is what would happen
if my toaster took a crap.

What are you talking about?
This is a perfectly good toaster.

Okay, you know what? I'll prove it to you.

Hope you're hungry.

Listen to that baby purr!

I hate you!

By the way, in case I forget,
I might be a little late on Monday.

- Oh. No problem. When should I expect you?
- Wednesday.

- Should I dock you for the time you miss?
- I wouldn't.

- Here you go.
- What's this?

I went to the store and asked them,
"What is the stupidest thing I can buy?"

And they gave me this toaster. Enjoy.

- You know, you didn't have to do that.
- You made it pretty clear that I did.

In fact, I forewent replacing my cell phone
to buy this.

"Forewent"?

It's a word.

Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.

You don't have to worry about me ruining
that one because I will never use it.

Okay, stop being ridiculous.

You want to know what's ridiculous?
A glass toaster.

What's next, a glass toilet
so you can wave goodbye to the toast?

How about a glass front door
so I can wave goodbye to you?

Oh, please! You would be lost without me.

- I would be lost without you?
- Yeah.

Okay, the only thing that you've brought
into my life is an oil-leaking Volvo...

...a musty smell in my guest room,
and the word "forewent."

It is the past tense of "forgo."
Edify yourself, sir.

And have you noticed
that all the people in your life come and go?

But I am the one constant.
I am always here.

Maybe the reason they come and go
is because you are always here.

When a woman dumps you,
who picks up the pieces? Alan Harper.

And who picks up the check?
Walden Schmidt!

Ah. Of course, of course.
Pull out the money card.

They're called credit cards.
Edify yourself, sir.

If this is how you think,
then I don't even know why I'm living here.

I do. Because it's free!

- Okay, okay, maybe I should go.
- Maybe you should.

- Fine. Okay.
- Fine. Okay.

- I am not bluffing.
- Ha-ha. Me neither.

This is me opening the door.

This is me watching.

- This is me leaving forever.
- This is me waving goodbye!

And this is me homeless.

Know what the problem is? Walden doesn't
appreciate what I bring to the party.

I've never seen you bring anything
to a party...

...except a Ziploc bag to steal the shrimp.

- Whose side are you on?
- Yours, of course.

I know you're upset, but I'm sure you
two lovebirds will kiss and make up.

Not happening. He does not want me back
and I'm not going back.

- You're not?
- No. I have my self-respect.

I do!

- So where are you gonna live?
- Ha-ha. Where am I gonna live? You're cute.

Thanks.
So where are you gonna live?

Seriously?

I want to live with you,
but when you move in...

...I want it to be because
I'm your first choice, not your last resort.

- You are my first choice.
- I'm your only choice.

My one and only choice.

Until Walden asks you to move back.

Oh, please! I am offended that
you could even suggest such a thing.

You are the woman I love, the woman I want
to spend the rest of my life with.

- Oh. You're right, I'm sorry. You can move in.
- Oh. Thank you.

- Gonna be nice to share the place.
- It'll be great.

- We'll split all the bills right down the middle.
- Ah...

Oh, come on, you don't want my money.

You're an independent woman!
Walk proud!

Walk over to this door
and let me back in!

Hey, Alan.

Oh, God! Herb. What are you doing?

- Neighborhood watch.
- Oh. That's nice. I didn't know there was one.

There isn't.
So you and Lyndsey have a little tiff?

Oh, not really a tiff as much as...

Hey, are you still rattling around
in that big old house all by yourself?

Yeah.
I don't think Judith's ever coming back.

That's terrifically sad.

You know, at a time like this,
you should not be alone.

Let's go over to your place,
have a few beers.

- Oh, you're a good friend, Alan.
- What can I say? I'm a giver.

Say, do you still have
the hide-a-bed in the den?

All right, I packed up all Zippy's stuff.

It's sad.

His entire life fits into one duffel bag.

What's even sadder is it's my duffel bag.

He's coming back.
You know that, right?

- No, he's not.
- He is a human boomerang.

He's gonna circle around, break a window,
and land right on your couch.

Open a window in the kitchen.
Maybe he'll just go straight through.

- Alan.
- Walden.

Don't worry. I'm here to pick up my things
and I'll be on my way.

Where you heading, Zippy?
Back to Mommy's?

Living with my mom.
That's pretty pathetic, isn't it?

No, for your information,
I am living with my ex-wife's ex-husband...

...at my ex-house.

Yeah, that's not pathetic.

- I packed your things for you. Ahem.
- Oh.

- I presume this is everything?
- You presume correct.

Your clothes, your toaster
and your expired Mexican boner pills.

Is it lonely up there, Walden?

Is it lonely on your cloud of judgment?

I don't know.
Maybe you could leave so I could find out.

All right, then, goodbye.

Berta, are you crying?

I can't help it. I'm just so damn happy.

Here you go. Two eggs over easy,
silver dollar pancakes...

...apple-wood smoked bacon,
and whole-grain toast.

This is delightful, Alan.
You really know how to spoil your man.

And you know how to flatter yours.

Wow, it seems like just yesterday
I was living here with Judith.

Only difference now is I actually
have a chance of getting laid.

If dinner's as good as breakfast,
you've got more than a chance.

Seriously, I appreciate
you letting me stay here.

It's nice to have someone around again.
Been a little lonely since Judith left.

- I found it lonely even when Judith was here.
- Mm.

Yeah, I've been watching TV alone
and drinking alone.

I painted a mustache on the bathroom
mirror so I'd have someone to talk to.

- Really?
- Yeah, I call him Javier.

"Don't worry, Herb.
You're better off. Judith, she's a bitch."

- Can't argue with Javier.
- I wouldn't. He's got a fiery Latin temper.

And a machete.

Um... Let me ask you something.

Does Herb have a machete?

- Morning.
- Morning.

Hey, Berta. Knock, knock.

- Who's there?
- Not Alan.

Free at last, Walden.
Thank God almighty, we're free at last.

Yeah.
Although it is a little quieter around here.

Get a dog. Then it won't seem so weird
when you catch him trying to lick himself.

- Hey, Berta?
- Yeah?

What do you think about turning
Alan's room into a gym?

Well, I was thinking about trying
to grow pot in there, but okay.

- Hey, Berta?
- Yeah?

What's going on with you?

What do you mean?

I don't know, like, how's your family?

- Incarcerated.
- Heh.

- That's funny.
- Okay, good talk.

- Hey, Berta?
- Yeah?

- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

It's Walden. Let me in.

What are your hopes?
What are your dreams?

I'm just hoping to get out
of this conversation.

- You're on fire today.
- Yeah.

- Hey, Berta?
- Oh, for the love of God, what?

- I like your vest.
- Thanks.

Where'd you get it?
Like, the vest store or something?

Thank God, I'm high.

Easy, easy. Sound the horn.
Let the townsfolk know you're coming.

The 9:04 from Pemberton,
now arriving on Track 1.

Right on time.

- I had no idea this was so much fun.
- I know.

Look, Alan. The McDougal boy
is coming home from college.

What a reunion this will be.
Welcome home, Jimmy.

Wow, you've created your own
little world here.

Oh, yeah, and this world's perfect.

Well, almost perfect.

Jimmy's brother Bobby got a little too close
to the tracks one night.

His friends were playing chicken
with a freight train.

They found his letterman jacket
three towns away.

- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

Engineer Stan never got over it.
He stopped talking to Helen.

Stays in his room and paints.

Huh. That's disturbing on a couple of levels.

It's so nice having you. I don't know why,
but train enthusiasts tend to be loners.

Yeah, it's a mystery.

- Hello?
- Hey, Herb, it's Walden.

Oh, hey, hold on a sec.
I gotta take this. It's the office.

No problem. I was going over to the bar car,
pick up a couple of brews. Want one?

Oh, make mine a root beer.
This town's seen enough tragedy.

- Hey, what's up?
- Is Alan there?

- Actually, no. I haven't seen him all day.
- I was really hoping to talk to him.

Can't talk to a person
that's not here.

Unless you draw a mustache on the mirror.

- What?
- Is there a message I can give him?

Yeah, just tell him I think I overreacted
and have him give me a call.

Done and done. Bye-bye.

- Everything okay at the office?
- Actually, it wasn't work.

- No?
- It was the president of the railroad.

He asked me to give you this.

- Congratulations, Conductor Alan!
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

Now let's get that coal car unloaded
and head over to the diner.

- Take a look at the new waitress.
- Ooh.

Word around town is she goes all the way.

- Hey, Jake!
- Hey, Walden.

How are you?
What's going on, buddy?

Not much. Is my dad there?

No, he actually moved out.

Ha-ha. Good one. Ha-ha.

No, I'm serious.
We got in a fight and he left.

My dad left the house?

Yeah. We got in a fight
because he bought a cheap toaster.

Wait, wait, and he bought something?

Yeah, and I didn't show any
appreciation for it.

He bought something with his own money?

I know. I shouldn't have screamed at him.
I should've thrown him a parade.

Wait a second, am I being Punk'd?

Hey, I got an idea. You know, just because
your dad doesn't live here anymore...

...doesn't mean you couldn't
come stay a couple days.

- And do what?
- I don't know, hang out?

Do guy stuff.
We could go to a bar and get drunk.

Hmm. I'm only 19. I can't drink.

Fine, we could just get high.

Dude, just call my dad and tell him
you want him to come back.

What if he says no?

Oh, you're serious.

He's not gonna say no.
Where has he even been living?

He moved into your guys'
old house with Herb.

Wow, if there was a freeloaders hall of fame,
my dad would be living in it.

For free.

- Hi, Herb.
- Walden.

- What are you doing here?
- I came to talk to Alan.

- Oh. He's not home. I'll tell him you stopped by.
Who's at the door?

Nobody! Go back in the train room!

- Alan.
- Walden?

What's going on?

- I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
- Really?

- Yes.
- Super. Hatchet buried.

- We'll have you over for Thanksgiving.
- Hold on.

I never meant to make you feel
unwelcome in my home.

Well, Alan has a new place now.

A place where he's appreciated.
A place where he feels safe.

A place where he can cry himself to sleep
at night without the fear of being mocked.

- You heard that?
- Still a baby monitor in there.

- So you also heard-
- Let it go, Alan.

I appreciate you too.

That's why I've been leaving messages
with Herb for days.

- What?
- You haven't gotten them?

- Herb.
- I'm sorry.

I just wanted a friend. You know,
one who wasn't trapped in a mirror.

Oh, Herb.

- I bought you something.
- You did?

- Don't happen to have a toaster, do you?
- I have a toaster.

Also have a guest room with a king-size bed
and a new 42-inch flat-screen TV.

- There's no TV in there.
- There could be.

Really?

Your turn.

I'm not gonna try to buy you.
You're either my friend, or you're not.

I have no such qualms.
I'll throw in a Blu-ray player.

- Wow.
- All right, I'm out of here.

No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

Herb...

...I can't thank you enough
for taking me in...

...but, as you can see,
Walden needs me.

- I wouldn't go that far.
- Shh!

Let me-
Let me get my things.

What is it about that little guy?

What is it about us
that we're fighting over him?

Ooh. What do we have here?

Uh-oh. She's being called
into the boss's office.

Looks like somebody
blew the Johnson account.

Really, Alan?

I thought you were still sleeping.

It's 8:00 in the morning.

So?

Hey, Herb. It's Walden.

How would you feel about shared custody?

.......... ********** ..........

Okay, salute the sun.

Deep cleansing breath.

Release your negative energy.

Oh. I'd better not.

The only thing holding me together
is negative energy.

And into downward dog.

Knees straight.

Extend your hips.

I'm trying. I'm trying.
I can't straighten my legs.

Here, let me just help you out here.

That's it.

That's it. Just let it go.

Let it go.

Shall I light some candles
and put on some music?

- We're doing yoga.
- It's none of my business. Put a towel down.

Berta, that's the doorbell.

Heard it. Not getting it.

I'll get it. I need a break anyway.

It's only been 5 minutes.

Not the first time I've heard that.

- Hey, Alan.
- Oh, hey, Herb. What brings you by?

You left your wallet at my house.

I didn't notice it was missing.

Really? It's been over a week.

Hard to notice something's missing
when you never use it.

- Thank you.
- Oh, no problem.

Hey, I want to apologize for my behavior lately.
I've been in a real dark place since Judith left.

No apologies necessary.
The important thing is you're feeling better.

I'm not putting her nightgown on a pillow
and spooning it anymore, so, uh...

...yeah, coming out of the darkness.

Oh, God. Oh, God...

What is it? Is it your back?

No, it's my front. I need a doctor.

- Right here.
- No, a real doctor.

Right here. Right here.
Where does it hurt?

It's my balls.

I'm gonna have to stick my hands
down your pants.

For once, I'm glad I didn't make it
into medical school.

Make it stop. Make it stop.

- A little swampy down here.
- I wasn't expecting company.

I see. You've got a twist in your
spermatic cord.

I'm gonna have to perform
a manual detorsion on your testes.

- What does that mean?
- Your nuts are in a knot. I need to untie them.

No, no, no.

That or your blood supply will be cut off.
You might lose a testicle.

Go, man, go.

Remember, righty tighty, lefty loosey.

This reminds me of the summers
of my youth.

- I used to pick peaches on my grandfather's-
- Just do it.

That feels good.

I love you, Herb.

We're gonna need a code word
so I stop walking in on this stuff.

Got the ice.
It's crushed. Kind of like your balls.

That is the worst pain
I've ever experienced.

Says the only guy in this room
who wasn't married to Judith.

- There you go.
- Whoa!

And just like that,
I'm a grower not a shower.

It's uncomfortable,
but you need to ice the soreness...

...for 20 minutes every couple of hours
and avoid sudden movements.

How did this happen?

Well, imagine your testicles
hanging like wind chimes.

Most days they sway gently
and you hear a beautiful melody.

Other days, the wind kicks up,
they get twisted and it sounds...

...like a washing machine
full of cowbells.

Am I gonna be okay?

Yeah, don't worry. To make sure,
you should stop by my office tomorrow...

- ...we'll do an ultrasound.
- An ultrasound in a pediatrician's office?

Well, when a kid swallows a matchbox car...

...you need to know if it's gonna drive out
on its own or has to be airlifted.

Well, good news.
Everything looks completely normal.

And speaking as a medical professional,
your junk is extraordinary.

Thank you.

I didn't know whether to examine it
or feed it a peanut.

Okay, I'm gonna put my clothes on now.

Avoid strenuous activity, and I'd like
to schedule a follow-up in a couple of weeks.

- Sounds good.
- Hey, while you're here...

...can I ask a little personal advice?

You've had your hands down my pants
on two separate occasions.

If you were a woman,
I'd be meeting your parents.

You've been dumped a lot, right?

No. I mean, what's a lot-?
Yes, I have.

- How did you get over your wife leaving you?
- Ha, ha.

You know the five stages of grief?

Sure.

They left out the three best ones:

Pot, one night stands,
and buying a beach house.

- I don't know. I'm not sure that's me.
- You can't sit around feeling sorry for yourself.

I'm getting so good at it.

It gets better. Just gotta get out there
and meet somebody new.

It's tough. Judith and I were together
for a long time.

I get it. She was your world.

But trust me, you will meet someone else
to spend the rest of your life with.

In my case it was Alan.

I'm surrounded by sick kids all day.
Where am I gonna meet someone?

You just gotta keep your heart
and your eyes open.

Who are they?

Oh, they're pharmaceutical reps.

They come by and give away free drugs.

Yeah, where are you gonna meet someone?

Okay, I've got a good feeling
about this one.

This is my house.

Okay, Mr. Driver, we're good.

Bye-bye.

Ladies, I must warn you...

...that once you cross this threshold
you waive your right to sobriety...

...chastity, dignity and a couple
of other "ity's."

- Waived.
- Yeah, me too, ha, ha.

Oh, wow.

This is so cool.

- Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.
- Oh, it's happening.

Okay, what's the plan?
Are we two twosomes, a foursome...

...or do you wanna have a threesome
while I watch? Because I'm fine with that.

I'm not.

Okay. I'll just take the tall one.

Which one's the tall one?

I got this.

Okay, ladies.

Alcohol is this way. We don't want anyone
sobering up and thinking things through.

Hey, Alan.

Hey. Who are your friends?

Oh, this is Plaxitril and she sells Kristen.

No, no, no. I'm Kristen.
I sell Plaxitril.

I'm pretty sure
it's the other way around.

Nice to meet you, Kristen.

Oh, and this is Morgan.

I sell boner pills and baby laxatives.

- And I'm Herb. Yes, I am.
- Hi, Herb.

Okay, salt, check.
Uh, limes, check.

- Tequila, check. Two gorgeous ladies-
Check.

The doctor is ready to administer some shots.
Some body shots.

Well, I guess I am
going to masturbate tonight.

Did I tell you that I was a gymnast?

You're kidding.

Nope. I was an alternate
for the Olympic team.

I can totally put both of my legs
behind my head.

Watch.

U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.

KRISTEN: Okay, I can't do that, but I can put my
entire fist in my mouth. Check it out.

Beautiful and talented.

KRISTEN
Thank you.

Yep. Definitely masturbating.

Hey, Alan.

Hey, uh, you guys having fun?

Yeah. I was just getting more tequila.
How are you?

I'm good. Just watching Downton Abbey.

Big episode. Someone stole a spoon.

Walden, get the video camera.

Oh! Good idea.

There's gonna be a video.

Hey, Alan, you got any Crisco?

- Uh, there's some olive oil by the stove.
- That'll work.

Have you seen my bra?

Uh, no.

- Your son hid it somewhere.
- I'm sorry, my son?

Yeah. Walden.

Hey, Alan?

Have you seen Plaxitril?

- Morning.
- Hey. What's that for?

You can't carry a toilet bowl.

Are you drunk or hung over?

Yes.

What happened last night?

There are a lot of gray areas...

There was tequila...

A walk on the beach...

...and then the Coast Guard escorted
our boat back to shore.

Wait, your boat?

Not technically.
I commandeered it.

Apparently, Plaxitril has a pirate side effect.

Top of the morning to you.

How are you in such a good mood?

Three pills, two pukes and a poo
and I'm good to go.

You know what, you were right.
I can't sit around feeling sorry for myself.

Last night was a revelation for me.
I've never felt so alive.

Which is ironic, because I believe
for a few minutes I was legally dead.

Now, who wants a Bloody Mary?

I'll have one.

Don't judge me. You stole a boat.

Attaboy. How about you, Walden?

I don't think I can have any more alcohol.

"I don't think I can have
any more alcohol."

Man up. I didn't fix those nuts
so you could grow a vagina.

- All right, I'll have one.
- Attagirl.

Oh, God.

Alan?

What?

What time is it?

It's 6:30.

Is the sun going up or down?

Not a clue.

What the hell?

Hey. Look who finally woke up.

- What's going on?
- We're having a party.

How?

Well, Morgan and Kristen came over...

- I sent out a couple of tweets.
- I posted pictures on Instagram.

Bing, bang, boom, here we are.

I chat on AOL a lot.

Okay, I think we need to shut this down.

Yeah, we're fried.

Oh, here. These will fix you up.

Are you a pharmaceutical rep too?

No, I'm a junior at Pepperdine.

Pepperdine's a good school.

Wow.

This looks like Charlie Sheen's house.

Alan...

Alan. Wake up.

Pepperdine is not a good school.

Why am I face down
on the back of the sofa in my underwear?

Because I was kind enough to put
underwear on you.

How did this happen?

Herb.

That guy's out of control.

This house is a mess.

Maybe I should I just cut my losses
and sell it.

Don't even joke like that.

Berta, thank God you're here.

Oh, hell no.

This was a very good idea.

Yeah. It's like an adult diaper
for your mouth.

Ahh! Wow.

Swimming in the ocean
is the best cure for a hangover.

Well, that and pharmaceutical cocaine.

Time to have the talk.

Yeah.

- Hey, Herb, you got a sec?
- Sure.

You're gonna have to come to us.

What's up?

Alan has something he wants
to tell you.

You know, Herb,
we think you're a lot of fun.

- Yeah, the last few weeks have been a blast.
- It's only been two days.

Oh, good lord.

I guess what we're saying is maybe it's time
to get back to our regular lives.

My regular life sucks.

No, it doesn't. You're just upset
because Judith left you.

Yeah. And I haven't thought about her
at all in the last two days.

Or weeks. Whichever we agreed is real.

And that's great. But we just-
We have to slow down a bit.

Yeah, just take a break.
Get back to normal.

You know, sleep, eat, bathe.

Pass a field sobriety test.

Wait, are you kicking me out?

- No-
- No, we're not kicking you out so much as...

...yeah, we're kicking you out.

- I see.
- It's nothing personal, it's just, sometimes-

Yes, it's personal.

Well, say no more.
I know when it's time to go.

- I'm sorry, Herb-
- I said, say no more.

Hey. I got new trash cans.

They're wicker?

- What's the problem?
- You can't puke in wicker.

It's like using a mesh condom.

All the important stuff gets through.

Fine. I'll return them.

Of course, I'll need to hold on
to your credit card for a few days.

Of course you will.

Hey, you haven't talked to Herb lately,
have you?

No. I texted him a couple of days ago
but he never responded.

I called him, invited him over for dinner,
and I never heard back.

- You think he's okay?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't he be?

- Exactly.
- Other than the fact that his marriage fell apart.

And the last time we saw him he was
counteracting pharmaceutical cocaine...

...by snorting cat tranquilizers.

And then we go kick him out.

Oh, my God, we killed Herb.

No, no, that's not true.

You killed Herb.

It's pretty cool that you can track
somebody from their credit card.

Yeah, I'd track you
if you ever used yours.

Alan, Walden. What are you doing here?

We were worried about you.

No need. Me and the girls were
about to eat.

- Lobster?
- No.

- Still partying with the pharmaceutical reps?
- They bailed. These chicks came with the room.

- Okay, Herb. It's time for the party to end.
- We're way past partying.

Welcome to the freak show.

You're right about that.

- Herb, you need help.
- No, no, I don't. All I need is more Plaxitril.

And possibly a hepatitis test.

So long.

And we were worried.

Well, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Buzzkill.

You're the missus.

- Why are you wearing a diaper?
- Saves time.

All right, enough is enough, Herb.
It's time to put your life back together.

- You need to go home.
- I don't think so.

Out there I'm just Herb, but here in room 204
at the Budget Motor Inn, I'm God.

Nobody tells God what to do.
Nobody.

- Judith?
- Cut the crap, Herb. Let's go.

- Okay. I missed you.
JUDITH: Shut up.

Did we do the right thing?

Definitely. If he had kept this up,
he wouldn't have lasted a week.

True. Now he'll only be dead
on the inside.

Walk, walk, walk.

- Is that a sheep wearing lipstick?
Don't look back.

Well, everything still looks fine.

- No more follow-ups?
- Nope. Dumbo's good to go.

So how are things with you?

Could not be better. I really appreciate
what you and Alan did for me.

- That's what friends are for.
- Judith and I are back. I'm a happy man.

Come in.

- Dr. Melnick? Here's that chart you asked for.
- Thank you.

Isn't that the girl from Pepper-?

Shh, shh, shh.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

- Hello?
- Hey, Dad, uh, this is my girlfriend, Tammy.

Tammy, this is my dad, Alan.

- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- How'd you two meet?

Couple of us guys went out
and they bet me 100 bucks...

...that I wouldn't get this tattoo
of two arms coming out of my butt.

- Jake, you didn't.
- No, Tammy wouldn't let me.

- Thank you.
- I took one look at his ass and thought:

"I don't wanna tattoo that,
I wanna bite that."

She's old enough to have you as her kid.

So what? You are too.

I don't understand why you're with Jake.

Bottom line is, I think your son is terrific.

And I know what we have isn't gonna last,
but it's what I want in my life right now.

I don't know the last time you had sex
with a 19-year-old boy, but it is a lot of fun.

What a nice surprise
to have you home for the weekend.

Well, it's good to be home.

Okay, I hate to be the one
to break up this happy reunion...

...but you both do realize
this is not your home.

He's cute.

He really is though.

- What's going on? Anything in the Army?
- Did I tell you I got promoted?

- I'm in charge of three guys in the kitchen.
- Wow, my son, the leader.

Yeah, it's awesome.
They have to do whatever I say.

I made this one guy
chug a tray of hot dog water.

- Uh, why would you do that?
- It's called earning respect, Dad.

- I don't understand.
- Which part? Earning or respect?

Bazinga.

That's from a TV show.

So, uh, how are things
with you and Tammy?

Actually, we broke up.

I'm sorry. What happened?

We just decided it wasn't gonna work out.
We had unrecognizable differences.

Uh, "Unrecognizable differences"?

When you can't see what the problem is,
but you have to break up anyway.

Somehow that actually makes sense.

So are you doing okay?
I know break-ups can be hard.

Yeah. It actually helps
to focus on my career.

Get this. One time, I made the guys
stick their things in pudding.

They must respect you so much.

- Tammy?
- Where the hell is he?

- I assume that you're talking about-
- Jake!

- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Get back here, you son of a bitch!

I am gonna kill you!

I sense that he didn't tell us everything.

Let go of me.
- Am I hurting you?

- No.
- How about now?

Ow, ow, ow!

- Wait, what the hell is going on?
- Tell them.

Um, I broke up with Tammy
to see another girl.

Oh, well, you know,
sometimes relationships run their-

Tell them who it was.

- I don't think they really-
- Tell them!

It was her daughter.

Wait. Wait, you slept
with your girlfriend's daughter?

Jerry Springer is taped
before a live studio audience.

I trusted you to be a good influence
on Ashley.

You know, it was your idea
for us to spend time together.

You were supposed to be tutoring her
in math. What were you thinking?

Jake tutoring math?
What were you thinking?

I figured you were gonna find another girl.

I just didn't think it would be the one
that came from my uterus.

Sorry, it just sort of happened.

Ow.

Sorry, it just sort of happened.

Jake, did you once consider
there were other people involved?

Of course, that's what made it so hot.
Her mom was in the other room-

That's it, I'm killing him!

- Dad, Dad-
- Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

Okay, walk me through this.
Start from the beginning.

Well, by all accounts I was a happy baby-

Fast forward. You and Tammy's daughter.

- How?
- All right...

...imagine Tammy at 18 in a string bikini...

...crying on your shoulder, saying,
"Why can't all guys be like you?"

Walden?

Oh, sorry, I was still imagining.

It was the perfect storm.

Ashley had just broken up with her
boyfriend and Tammy was asleep.

I'm the victim here.

Okay, on one hand,
your behavior is despicable...

...on the other, the elusive
mother-daughter combo, up top.

Last time, you were saying Tammy
was the love of your life...

- ...and you wanted to marry her.
- What can I say?

I was young and naive back then.

That was six weeks ago.

I never meant to hurt Tammy.
I care about them both.

Hey, do you think there would ever be a
chance I could get them together and...?

You're adorable.

What the hell is wrong with your son?

That is a question for the ages.

Kind of like, if there really is a God,
why is there so much sorrow in the world?

Or, how have I managed to keep
living in this house all these years?

You know, I'm tempted to sleep with you
just to get back at him.

Oh, well, I'm, uh-
I'm, uh, flattered, but I actually have a girl-

I was just kidding.

How could he do this to me?

Well, you said yourself you knew
this thing with Jake wasn't gonna last.

But there are plenty of skanks
in our town.

Why did he have to pick my little skank?

I wish there was something
that would make you feel better.

Uh, what if Jake apologized?

What if I cut his balls off?

So we've got options.

All right, you two...

...now let's, uh, think of the couch
as a safe place for communication.

Uh, neutral corner. Neutral corner.

Now- And this pillow represents
the wall of respect.

Okay, I'm gonna place it
between the two of you.

Okay?

Now, uh, Tammy, would you like to start?

Hey! Hey!

She hit me with the wall of respect.

And you slept with my daughter.

So we'll call it even?

- Hey!
- What's going on?

Oh. Well, it's complicated.

Uh, you remember Jake's girlfriend, Tammy?

She has an 18-year-old daughter-

And Jake nailed her.

Okay, not that complicated.

Uh, Jake, do you wanna say something?

All right. Uh, I'm sorry for cheating on you
with your daughter.

But, I mean, when you think about it,
it's really a compliment.

Because she's just
a much younger version of you.

I'll get that.

- I didn't know Jake had it in him.
- Apparently he's had it in everybody.

- Ashley?
- Baby!

Get your mouth off my daughter,
you cheating son of a bitch!

That would make a great country song.

- Ashley, what are you doing here?
- Mom, I know you're upset.

And that's why I came, but-

- Hey, is that my shirt?
- Hey, is that my boyfriend?

Oh, please. Like you haven't
stolen boyfriends from me before.

He was your teacher!

- Yeah, and thanks to you, I failed biology.
- No, biology failed me!

This makes me so homesick.

- Come on, Mom.
- No, Ashley, I am not gonna let you...

...throw your life away for this loser.

Hey, hey, that loser is my son.
And your ex-boyfriend.

I was just having fun.
Ashley needs to think about her future.

Hey, he has a very bright-

You know what, this is family business.

You are not the boss of me.
If I want to date a loser, then I will.

Thank you.

I can actually feel my IQ dropping.

- You Jake's father?
- Yeah?

Oh!

You don't have to pay me for today.

What the hell? Why did you hit me?

Because I can't hit a kid.

- And your son's messing with my Ashley.
- You're Ashley's dad?

Ew, no.

I'm her boyfriend.

Ew, no.

He's my ex-boyfriend. I'm with Jake now.

Oh, come on, I take craps bigger than him.

It takes me an hour and a half, but I do it.

What are you doing here, Jerry?

Jerry?

From Jerry's Cadillac in Tustin?

- That's right, son. No credit, no problem.
- Really?

Want a Caddy? I'm your daddy.

I want a daddy.

I want you back, Ashley.

Whatever. Too little, too late, Jer Bear.

Yeah, Jer Bear.

Like that song, "If you liked it,
you should have put a ring on it."

Well, I bought you a belly ring.

Oh, that was you?
I chipped my tooth on that thing.

Uh, just out of curiosity,
how did you meet Hannah Montana here?

It's actually a cute story.

We were shooting the commercial
for our Fourth of July Savings Spectacular.

I was dressed as Uncle Sam
with a row of pretty girls behind me...

...wearing bikinis and waving sparklers.

I took one look at Ashley, pointed at her
and said, "Uncle Sam wants you."

That is a cute story.

Fireworks went off in my pants that night.

Okay, not so cute anymore.

How can you not love a girl like this?

She's smart, she's funny, and she's got
a better body than the new SRX Crossover.

- Don't you, darling?
- Don't "darling" me.

- You had your chance and you blew it.
- Come on. I've been married four times.

And you know why they didn't work?
I got a mistress.

And her name is Customer Satisfaction.

All right. Look, Jerry, if my little girl doesn't
wanna see you, then you gotta go.

- Thanks, Mom.
- Shut up.

Okay, it takes two to make a deal.

But know this, Ashley.

I guarantee I will always love you.

Just like I guarantee
no one can beat my prices.

If you need a set of wheels
Jerry's making super deals

At Jerry's Cadillac

Oh, come on, it's catchy.

God, I've failed as a parent.

- No.
- Yeah.

Maybe.

My beautiful young daughter
narrowed her choices down...

...to a 19-year-old who needs to ask
the Wizard for a brain...

...and a sleazy car salesman
who barely escaped a Dateline special.

Okay, so it's not an ideal situation.

What is? Sometimes kids make mistakes.

Sometimes kids are mistakes.

Well, look, when I was a kid I made choices
my parents didn't agree with.

Like dropping out of MIT,
and that turned out great.

Somehow I don't think Ashley's
on the road to incredible wealth.

She's more on the road
to antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.

Wow. That's just...

Wow.

When is it gonna stop?

When's what gonna stop?

The taking.

I mean, that's all kids ever do.

I mean, first they take over your body,
like a little parasite...

...and then they trash
your fun zone on the way out.

They suck your boobs till your nipples look
like the worn-out thumb on a work glove.

You do paint a picture with your words.

And then it gets really bad.

They take your sleep, your time...

...your favorite dress, keys to your car...

...the weed you had hidden
in a cowboy boot in the back of your closet.

Leave it to my daughter to go
the extra mile and take my boyfriend.

And you know why you keep giving?

Because I'm a glutton for punishment?

Because you love her
and you want what's best for her.

I suppose.

Okay, let me ask you this.
Were you happy with Jake?

I mean, you know,
before he started climbing the family tree?

Honestly, Jake's a great guy.

So isn't it possible that he may also
be a great guy for your daughter?

- No.
- Yes.

Maybe.

Really? The thumb on a work glove?

Oh, honey, that was two boob jobs ago.
These puppies can cut glass now.

- I'm sorry Jerry hit you, Dad.
- So am I.

What was that about? I mean, he won't hit a
kid, he'll hit somebody way older than him?

- What?
- I said, "He won't hit a kid...

...but he'll hit someone way older than him!"

Hey.

I have something I wanna say to you two.

Don't care.

I swear to God, Ashley, I paid to get those
teeth straight. I will crooked them up again.

Ba-ba-ba-ba.
Eye on the ball, Tammy. Eye on the ball.

If you two want to be with each other...

- ...I am not gonna stand in your way.
- Really?

If you think you can be happy together,
then be happy together.

Wow. Thank you, Tammy.

I guess I just hope Ashley and I
can be as happy as you and I were.

Stop talking.

But I already am happy, Jake Bear.
Give me some sugar.

This is the oddest family moment
I have ever witnessed.

Maybe I should grease up a pig
in case they wanna wrestle later.

- Jerry.
- I feel bad about before...

...so I brought you an official
Jerry's Cadillac beer koozie.

I told you, it's over.

You did.

But I'm driving home...

...in my limited-edition Escalade...

...when it hits me.

If I've learned one thing in my 25 years...

...as Orange County's number-one dealer
of premium luxury vehicles...

...it's that you don't take no for an answer.

God, this guy's good.

So I came back here
to ask you just one question.

What's it gonna take
to get you into my life today?

Oh, my God, look at the size of that rock.

Dude, you can't buy her love
with a diamond ring.

But wait, there's more.

My manager's gonna kill me...

...but if you say yes right now...

...I'll throw in a 2012 powder blue Mercedes
SL I just bought at a police auction.

I don't know what to do.

- Take the car!
- Take the car!

- Dad!
- It's a Mercedes.

- We got a deal, Ashley?
- Sold!

Aw.

I love these people.

Jake?

- Doing okay?
- I guess.

I really screwed things up this time,
didn't I?

Well, you certainly screwed
everything you could.

I mean, I had such a good thing going,
first with Tammy and then Ashley...

...and now I'm all alone.

That's because you're a Harper.
That's what we do.

We take something good,
and turn it into nothing.

I don't like being a Harper.

Nobody does, son.

Nobody does.

What a day, huh?

Yeah. Sorry about all the trouble.

Are you kidding me? Jerry sold me
an Escalade at dealer cost.

Oh, honey, you didn't fall for that, did you?

He really is the king, isn't he?

And my daughter gets to be the queen.

It's a white trash fairy tale.

Let's talk about something happy. Remember
when Alan got punched in the face?

Yeah, that was awesome.

You know, the older I get,
the less I understand about relationships.

Me too. I'm like a blind man trying
to get out of a doorknob factory.

How is that possible?

I mean, you're handsome,
and smart, and charming.

You're embarrassing me.

Go on.

You've got the whole package.

You do too.

I mean, you're beautiful,
you're independent, you're intelligent.

Oh, stop.

Don't actually stop.

You're funny.

You're...

...really, really beautiful.

Okay, that probably wasn't a good idea.

Definitely not.

Berta's gonna love this.

.......... ********** ..........

- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

I thought you and Alan
were going out to dinner.

We were, but then he discovered
his coupon was only good for to-go orders.

- That guy's a piece of work.
- He is.

Which is ironic because
he never seems to go to work.

That's true.

But that being said,
I do envy what you guys have.

You guys are like termites.

- Termites?
- Yeah, they mate for life...

...and once they live in your house
you can never get rid of them.

Just like Alan.

You all right?

Yeah. I have to do something with him
tonight that's going to be really painful.

Okay, that's between
two consenting adults.

No.

I'm breaking up with him.

What?

No. But you guys are great together.

You're so beautiful and smart and fun...

...and Alan is so lucky.

I don't want to hurt him.

Then do something else.

Disneyland, dancing, bowling, pretty
much anything but break up with him.

- I have to.
- But you and I are his world.

- And if you leave, I'll be his world.
- I'm sorry.

No, I don't think you heard me.
I'll be his world.

I feel so bad.

All right. Come here.

This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

And I pushed a baby out of my vagina.

I'm back!

Don't say anything.

Hey, Walden, you wanna join us?

Uh...

No, thanks.

Hey, what do you say we all go bowling?

Huh?

Doesn't that sound fun? Just bowling?

No, I think we're just gonna stay in tonight.

Oh, but I have a confession to make.
I, uh, opened my fortune cookie in the car.

And listen to this: "Your life is about
to take a turn for the better."

I think you may have got Lyndsey's cookie.

- Would you like another glass of wine?
- Yes.

Oh, you know, I was thinking
after dinner we could light a fire.

Don't worry, I've got all the wood we'll need.

Cute.

Uh, you seem awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?

- I've just got a lot on my mind.
- Hmm? What is it, sweetie?

Oh, boy. I don't know how to say this.

Well, a problem shared is a problem halved.

Kind of like that fried rice, although
I noticed you didn't touch your half...

...despite the fact you had to order it
though the white rice was free...

...and the coupon specifically said
"no substitutions."

I think we should break up.

Excuse me.

Are you okay?

You owe me 22.50 for dinner.

Hey, Berta.

Just finishing up,
then I'll get out of your way.

I think you should stay here.

All right. Let me take a quick shower first.

No. Lyndsey's downstairs
breaking up with Alan.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Well, we knew this was coming.

First time I saw them together,
I asked her to blink twice...

...if she was being held hostage.

He's gonna be devastated.

He's in love with her,
they've been dating for years.

They were planning on getting married.
Oh, my God, he's never gonna leave my house.

It's sweet that you actually thought
he was going to.

Why do people have to break up?

Well, in my experience, either
the magic wears off or the mushrooms.

I feel really bad for him.
I mean, I always feel bad for him...

- ...but I feel really bad for him.
- Yeah, yeah, it's tough.

We gonna do this thing or what?

I don't understand.
Where is this coming from?

There's no spark anymore.
All we do is sit around, watch TV...

...eat takeout from whatever restaurant
you have a coupon for.

Did you want to go to the food court?
Because we can do that.

- Alan, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

I thought you were happy.
I thought everything was great.

It was, but things change. People change.

That's not true. I don't change.
I never change.

- Maybe that's part of the problem.
- I can change.

I know this is upsetting,
but better do this now before it gets worse.

How can it be worse?

You gonna tell me you've been faking it
all these years? Don't answer that.

Alan, I have to go.

Fine, go. Don't go.

I'm really sorry.

The thing is I still love you, Alan.

I'm just not in love with you anymore.

It's not a deal breaker.

- You okay?
- I guess.

I suppose it's better that she broke up
with me now than after we got married.

Then she would've gotten
half of all my stuff.

Sure.

- You know, I'm here for you.
- I know that, and I appreciate it.

- But I'm good.
- Good.

- Walden?
- Yeah?

I'm not good.

I love her.

- I know you do.
- I'll never find another one like her.

I know you won't.

I'm just saying I know how great she is.

You're gonna be fine. Just you have
to focus on the good things in your life.

Lyndsey was the only good thing in my life.

Okay. Let it all out.

That's a lot out. Let's put some back in.

Now you're all I have.

I know.

Good morning. Beautiful day.

To stick your head in an oven?

Okay, I realize I was a little upset last night.

A little? You Googled "how to kill yourself
without it hurting."

Drama queen.

But I woke up this morning and I realized...

...what am I so upset about?
Lyndsey and I are not breaking up.

Okay. So when she said
that she didn't wanna see you anymore...

...and she didn't think you made a good
couple and she wasn't in love with you...

- ...what do you call that?
- Foreplay.

Okay. Looks like someone's starting
their day with a hot, steaming cup of denial.

No, this is a little dance we do all the time.

She decides I did something wrong
and gives me the business...

...and then I apologize
and I give her the business.

Okay, see, that right there.
That's why she broke up with you.

I'm telling you, we are not broken up.

Okay. I see what you're doing here...

...but pretending
like what happened didn't happen...

...won't make it not happen, no matter
what you would like to have had happen.

Yeah, that's right.

Thank you, I appreciate it.

But if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get my girl back.

Okay. Just in case, I'll preheat the oven.

Alan. What are you doing here?

What am I doing here?
That's what I love about you.

Okay, let's do this. I'm sorry.

There's nothing to be sorry about.
Our relationship just isn't going anywhere.

All right, message received, loud and clear.
Now let's get down to business.

Alan, it's over.

- But why?
- It just is.

Is it because we don't like the same things?
Because I can learn to love sports.

- It has nothing-
- Is it because I'm frugal?

Okay. Watch this. I'm gonna rip a 20-
A 5-dollar bill in half. Okay.

Tell me that's not sexy.

Okay, look, I didn't wanna have to say this...

...but the fact of the matter is...

...I've met someone else.

Oh, wow. Wow.

Uh, world spinning, gut tightening,
vomit rising.

- I'm really sorry.
- Who is he?

- What's the difference?
- I need to know who my competition is.

I need to know how I can win.

You can't win. Goodbye, Alan.

Well, I have got news for you.
The word "win" is not in my vocabulary.

"Can't. " The word "can't"
is not in my vocabulary.

Damn it.

Ow! Son of a bitch.

Of course, dog crap.

Hey. There's soup on the stove
if you want some.

I wonder if Lyndsey's new boyfriend
likes soup.

He probably loves soup
and wears cable-knit sweaters.

"Look at me,
I'm eating soup and wearing a sweater...

...while I bang the memory of Alan Harper
out of this woman's mind."

- Let it go.
- You brought it up.

I brought up soup.

I can't stop thinking about him. And her.

And what they're doing.
And what position they're doing it in.

And where they're doing it.

In the bed, in the shower, at the Costco
between the meat and the tires.

That was our place.

That shouldn't be anyone's place.

- You're obsessing.
- No, I'm not.

Right. We all picture our exes screwing
between a rump roast and a snow tire.

You know, I'm gonna go for a drive.

- Where?
- Just out. You know, joy ride.

I've seen your car.
There's no joy in that ride.

Now, where are you going?

I'm gonna drive up the coast a little bit,
take in the sea air.

How? Your windows don't roll down.

Just the ones in front.
The ones in back don't roll up. Goodbye.

I should buy him a new car.

So he can live in it.

All right, where are they?

They're probably watching sports
right now.

"Hey, Lyndsey, heh...

...you don't mind if I watch this baseball game
in the nude, do you?"

"Sure.

You can kiss me between the strikes
and I'll kiss you between the balls."

Oh.

Hey, Walden.

Yeah, I'm just, you know, taking a drive down
the Malibu coast, trying to clear my head.

Yeah, now I'm walking on the beach.
The sand feels nice on my toesies.

Walking on the beach, huh?

- Are you stalking me?
- Are you stalking Lyndsey?

I asked you first.

Pathetic. Sitting outside a woman's house...

...trying to catch a glimpse of her through
the window. What kind of person does that?

Hey, guys. What are we doing?
Playing a little peek-a-boo with Lyndsey?

- No.
- Yes.

Lyndsey broke up with Alan
and he's having a hard time understanding.

Well, one look at the new guy
and you'd understand it.

- Wait, you've seen him?
- Oh, yeah, Nick's gorgeous.

- He kind of looks like Walden.
- Aw, thank you.

You know his name. So you've met him?

No, but I've heard her yell it.

It's either, uh, "Nick" or "Oh, God, right there."

That's it. I've gotta see
this Nick guy for myself.

No. Alan, don't.

- You're better than this.
We both know that's not true.

- I feel for him. It's gotta be tough.
- Yeah, no doubt.

You really are a very handsome man.

Again, thank you.

It's not hard to imagine you naked
and cast in marble.

- Getting weird, Herb.
- Right.

All right.

Where are you, you home-wrecker? Oh!

That's better.

Can this get any worse?

Oh, God, Nick, right there!

Aw.

- Lyndsey, hey.
- Hey, I need your help.

You need my help getting back together
with Alan?

No.

I need you to tell him to stop calling,
e- mailing and texting me.

Words and pictures.
Especially the pictures.

- He's just upset, but he means well.
- Really?

- Does this picture look like he means well?
- Oh, dear God.

Is he lying on my kitchen table?

- So will you talk to him?
- Sure.

- Right after I burn my kitchen table.
- Thank you.

By the way, you might wanna burn
your bathtub too.

He's coming now, gotta go.

Hey. There he is.

Looking good.

'Ha, ha."

- Where you going?
- Lyndsey un-friended me on Facebook...

...so I'm gonna go re-friend her
with my face.

- No, you're not.
- You can't stop me.

Damn you.

- Hey, Zip.
- What do you want?

A motorcycle and another night
with Neil Diamond.

- But, for now, we need to talk.
- I just wanna be left alone.

Like I'm gonna be for the rest of my life.

Look, Lyndsey's crazy
for breaking up with you.

- You are a great guy.
- You're just saying that.

I know I'm rough on you,
but that's just for fun.

I really mean this.

- Thank you.
- All right, good talk.

- How?
- What?

How am I a great guy?

Well, you're punctual.

- I do make it a priority to be on time.
- Yep.

What else?

Okay, you have pretty good toilet aim.

And that's important to a housekeeper.

My secret is I sit down.

And that should've stayed a secret.
Take care.

- Berta?
- What?

If I'm such a great guy,
then why did Lyndsey leave me?

There's no telling with chicks.

But don't worry, you'll find somebody else.

As good as Lyndsey?

Look at you, already making jokes.

- How'd it go?
- He's gonna die alone.

And he pees sitting down.

I really don't wanna be here, Walden.

What are you talking about?
You're doing great.

You shaved, you showered...

...you realized wearing Lyndsey's
underwear wasn't a long-term solution.

I may have it together on the outside,
but on the inside I'm still a wreck.

I just wanna go home and eat ice cream
on the toilet until I fall asleep.

Will you listen to yourself?
Trust me, tonight is gonna be fun.

Okay, but if it's not, you're gonna
have to watch The Notebook with me.

Really? Again?

- Walden?
- Oh, hey, Allie, hi.

This is my friend Alan
I was telling you about.

- Hi, Alan.
- Hello.

You two have a lot in common.

Really?

You know your girlfriend's boyfriend, Nick?

- Yeah.
- I'm his soon-to-be ex-wife.

I'll just let you two talk.

Oh. oh.

I can see what Walden's trying to do here.

He means well, but I don't know
that I'm emotionally ready to jump back in-

- How do you feel about revenge sex?
- Big fan. I'll get the check.

Well, well, well,
look who's doing the walk of shame.

More like the stride of pride.

Guess who heard "Oh, God, right there"
multiple times last night?

Not Nick.

- Congratulations. I'm very happy for you.
- I have you to thank.

I didn't do anything.

Tracking Allie down
couldn't have been easy.

It wasn't that hard.

When we were outside Lyndsey's house,
she was parked behind us.

Ironic, because last night
I was parked behind-

All right, got it. I got it.

I'm happy you're feeling better.

Oh, yeah. Let me tell you, revenge sex is
way better than revenge masturbation.

Of course,
there's no reason you can't do both.

Oh, God, why am I eating on this table?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on Two and a Half Men:

- You seem quiet tonight. Everything okay?
- I've just got a lot on my mind.

Well, a problem shared is a problem halved.

I think we should break up.

- Lyndsey's breaking up with Alan.
- Really?

He'll be devastated. He's madly in love
with her. They've dated for years.

- They were planning on getting married.
- I still love you, Alan.

I'm just not in love with you anymore.

- Hey, Zip.
- I just wanna be left alone.

Lyndsey's crazy for breaking up with you.

- You are a great guy.
- Thank you.

- You'll find somebody else.
- As good as Lyndsey?

Look at you. Already making jokes.

Hey, what you doing?

Oh, just taking a stroll down memory lane.

It's a photo book that Lyndsey gave me.

Here we are at the Santa Monica Pier.

"Oh, Alan, I'm having such a great time.
I know it looks like I'm eating cotton candy...

...but I'm waiting for someone better to
come along so I can dump your sorry ass."

That dude in the Speedo
totally photo-bombed you.

Bet she was sleeping with him too.

And look at the guy with the churros.
What's he smiling about?

Okay, you know what?
You can't live in the past.

You also can't live in this robe.
It's like the sacred Shroud of Urine.

What happened? Lyndsey and I
were supposed to take care of each other...

...for the rest of our lives.

She'd blend my steak
so I didn't have to gum it.

I'd change the tennis balls
on the bottom of her walker.

We could keep track of each other's moles.

That's a romantic picture.

Glad you think so, because now that's
just gonna be you and me.

It's not gonna be you and me,
because, A, no.

And, B, you're gonna find somebody new.
You just have to have a positive attitude.

If you say you can't, you're right.
If you say you can, you might.

Do that again.

Ow! Ow!

Now suck it up!
You're gonna find somebody new!

- I can't.
- Why not?

Look at me!

- What?
- Look at me.

When I met Lyndsey, I was a solid six.
Now I'm a soft four at best.

Really? You thought you were a six?

Well, maybe not a Malibu six,
but a Walmart six.

It didn't matter. No one takes care
of themselves when they're in love.

When you have sex in a sweatshirt,
you stop doing sit-ups.

Well, then do something about it.

Get yourself back in shape, get some new
clothes, get a haircut, get your own place.

Anything to get your confidence back.

I appreciate the pep talk,
but I've lost all hope.

I can't give you hope, but I can give you
my American Express Black Card.

Hope's for losers.

- Hey, Walden.
- Hey, Jake, what's going on?

I was just calling my dad back.
He left me a voice mail.

At least I think it was him.

It was just, like, two minutes of someone
sobbing and then throwing up.

Yeah, that was him.

How often does he cry?

It'd be quicker to tell you
how often he doesn't.

He's gonna be okay, right?

Yeah, he actually got dressed today
and left the house.

And he even put on deodorant.

Well, actually I put it on him,
but he let me, so it's progress.

I'm so glad that you're there for my dad.

You're like the son he never had.

Right.

Okay, so I'm gonna get going.

Yeah, yeah, me too. I gotta go run some
black ops and test some ballistic weapons.

Really? That sounds awesome.

No, I'm just messing with you. I'm gonna
go get high and make like 800 cupcakes.

Sleep well, America.

Ta-da!

Wow!

Wow.

You look...

Look at you.

- This is your vision, my friend.
- Oh, no. I could not envision this.

You were right.
It's time for me to get back to living life.

Check out my sweet onion.

My bodacious Vidalia.

Wow.

How did you pack all of you in there?

Ah! Well, uh, I guess I would have to say
that it's...

...Spanx to these.

Is that a girdle?

Oh, no, it's a male sport control top.

It's for athletes.

Athletes with man boobs.

Not anymore.

Heather, the salesgirl,
said I look like a DILD.

Oh?

It stands for "dad I'd like to do."

Let's talk about that hair.
Walk me through that.

Oh, a young man named Juan
did this to me. Um...

Uh, he does Justin Bieber's hair.

- Oh, wow, that's lucky.
- I know.

Can't believe Justin Bieber
goes to Supercuts.

Driving home, you can't imagine
how many people were checking me out.

Oh, I can imagine.

What do you say we go someplace
and try out my new look?

I wanna get my groove on
with the hip, funky people.

Okay, yeah, I'll see if I can fire up
the time machine, we'll head back to 1974.

I'll, uh, put my stuff away.

- Uh, Alan?
- Yeah?

- My credit card?
- Oh, right.

Release.

I'm trying.

Wow, I'm seeing your hairdo
everywhere I look.

Best 10 bucks I ever spent.

I wish I had my deck of cards.

Deck of cards?

Oh, yeah. Close-up magic is a great
icebreaker with the ladies.

What is wrong with you?

What is wrong with you
that you have a quarter in your ear?

Give me that.
Come on, you're a charming guy.

Just be yourself, stick to your strengths.

I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I have a quarter in my ear.

Will you stop that?

How about her? Go buy her a drink.

- She's a little out of my league, isn't she?
- You're not even playing the same sport.

Just go say hi.

Okay, here goes.

Uh, hi, can I buy you a drink?

Uh, no, thanks. I already have one.

Uh, can I reimburse you for that one?

Excuse me?

Well, I would've happily bought you a drink
if I'd arrived a few moments earlier.

Tell you what,
let me just give you some cash.

You're kidding, right?

Here's a 10. Do you have change?

What is wrong with you?

Well, I'm not gonna tip you.

That was weird.

Yeah, she's the weird one.

Maybe we should just go home.

You're just a little rusty.
Let me help you out.

Hi.

Well, hello.

You know, before we go any further,
I should warn you...

...that I suffered from a horrific
industrial accident.

- Down there.
- Oh, no.

Oh, yes.

Say hi to my friend, Alan.

How bad was the accident?

Say hi.

Hi, I'm Alan.

I'm a back doctor, but that doesn't mean
I can't check out your front.

Oh, my God.

That is hilarious. You're so funny.

Oh, my God.

- I have a question for you.
- Yeah?

How did you get this quarter in your ear?

How did you do that?

Pull something else out of me.

I like her.

Oh, my God!

Excuse me, how did you
get this quarter in your ear?

Wow, heh. This is quite a place.

Thank you.

Looks like Elton John went on safari.

Oh. Uh, nice eagle. It's, uh, very realistic.

I wanna feed it a bronze mouse.

I can't believe you live here all by your-

SÃ¡bado Gigante!

You like?

Oh, yeah.

The hair on my head
isn't the only thing standing up.

Well, now it's your turn.

I can't wait to get my hands
on that tight little body.

Oh, uh, can I just freshen up a little?

Down the hall, to the left.

I'll be waiting.

You gotta be kidding me.

Really?

Hurry up, or she's gonna think
you're pooping.

Hello?

- Hello?
In here.

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Oh, boy.

- Uh, hi.
- Oh, sorry...

...I just gotta take care of something here.

Did you gain weight?

Oh, no, this is water weight. Too much salt.

So who's this? Your grandpa?

No, he's my husband.

Your husband?

Don't worry,
he doesn't even know we're here.

Well, maybe not,
but I am not the kind of man who-

- Can pass up an opportunity like this.

Hold on.

You have a lovely home.

Morning.

Oh, Zippy,
like it wasn't easy enough before.

I wouldn't expect you
to understand European chic.

Looks more like you're-a-peeing
on a power line.

Nice. Hey, tell me about that girl last night.

- Uh, well, she's a vegetarian.
- Yeah?

And her husband's a vegetable.

- What?
- She's married.

- And the guy's like 900 years old.
- You're kidding.

- She hot?
- Yeah.

- He rich?
- Mm-hm.

Checks out.

So how old is this guy?

Well, let me put it this way.

He was one of the original investors
in apple, the fruit.

Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

No, it worked out.

You didn't?

What do you want from me?
He was in a coma and she was in a teddy.

You surprise me.
I thought you had more integrity than that.

Where in the hell have you been?

You know what?
Can we just stop for a second?

What's wrong?

You don't know me well,
but I happen to be a man of great integrity.

And it's hard for me to do this knowing
your husband is right next door.

You want me to put him in a cab
for a couple hours?

I don't think that's gonna help.

Look, I know I'm technically taken...

...but you have to understand,
Victor was 80 when I married him.

And now 12 years later, he's still alive...

...and we're both using machines
to get us through the night.

How did you two even meet?

I was on a pole, he was in a wheelchair.

Our eyes met and when I turned
right-side up, I knew he was the one.

That's very romantic.

Can't expect you to know what it's like to rely
on someone to put a roof over your head...

...and provide you
with the luxurious life you deserve.

Oh, my God, we're soul mates.

I got it. It's for me.

Surprise!

You brought your husband?

It's our anniversary.

It didn't seem right to leave him alone.

Uh, well, this doesn't seem better...

...uh, but come on in.

Uh, Meghan, you remember Walden.
Walden, this is Meghan's husband, Victor.

It's their anniversary.

Hi, Victor. It's nice to meet you.

Yeah, this is normal.

Can you give me a hand?

I'm just gonna wheel him on to the deck.

Oh, uh, sure.

Look, Victor, the ocean.

You remember it
from when you discovered America.

Good one.
But technically Columbus didn't-

Shut up.

Right. Do you think we should
get them a cake?

Look at him. He is a cake.

Right, right. Plus we don't want to
get him all hopped up on sugar.

Come here.

There are a billion women in this world.
Why this one?

I don't know. She's like a powerful
sex magnet and I'm like a sex refrigerator.

- What does that even mean?
- I have no idea what it means.

I just need you to babysit her decomposing
husband while I plow his wife.

It's their anniversary.

Oh, come on.

Looks like you found a new friend, Vic.

Can I call you Vic?

I'm gonna call you Vic.

Is this what I have to look forward to, Vic?

You live your life,
you try to be a good person...

...work hard to achieve your goals, only to
end up a prisoner to your own body...

...while the love of your life
is in the next room...

...doing the splits for some idiot
she met in a bar?

If this is it, just kill me now.

Vic? Vic?

Oh, come on!

Alan!

Bad time, Walden.

It's even worse out here. Open the door.

What's so important?

I'm pretty sure that your girlfriend's
husband is dead.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

She's not my girlfriend.

No, no, no, he can't die here.

I think he already did.

No, you don't understand. He can't die here.

I have an infidelity clause in my prenup.

If his greedy 70-year-old kids find out
that I was here, they'll take all my money.

Are you kidding? Your money?

Well, in all fairness, she did earn it
the old-fashioned way.

Well, thank you, Alan. Show a little respect.

Now stuff him in the car
while I go find my panties.

Look at what you did.
You got my girlfriend upset.

I thought she wasn't your girlfriend.

She's gonna inherit millions of dollars.
She's my girlfriend.

When we get there, put him in his bed...

- ...you guys leave and I'll call 911.
- Don't worry, sweetheart, after the funeral...

...we'll go someplace warm and beautiful,
where we can heal. And tan.

And swim with the dolphins.

You two dreamers do realize that
what we're doing right now is a felony?

I realize, and I owe you one.

One? Seriously? One?

I want ice cream!

I can't believe you found
a quarter down there.

And if you look closely, George is smiling.

- Why don't I get us some champagne?
- Oh, yes.

Champagne makes me do crazy things.

Well, that's good, because "crazy," "thing."

Nice job in there.

You saw?

I like to watch. Shh!

.......... ********** ..........

- You are so pretty.
- Thank you.

- Pretty, pretty, pretty.
- Okay. Okay.

Pretty man trying to drive a car here.

How did you get more drunk
since we left the party?

Well...

I brought a roadie.

Where did you get that?

My purse.

Your purse?

Oh, no, it spilled.

Do you want some?

No, you need to get rid of that drink.

Fine, Mr. Man.

Oops.

Okay, it's time to get Stacey home
and under the covers.

I think it's time to get Walden home
and under Stacey.

That's not gonna happen.

Boo.

Maybe another time.

Yay!

I think I'm gonna take a little nap
before we get there.

- Okay.
- I'm so hungry.

We'll be home soon and-
Whoa, that is not food.

Are you sure you don't wanna stay?
Because we could have sex.

You've made that abundantly clear,
uh, but, no, thank you.

To have sex with me, you'd need to be able
to stand on one leg and touch your nose.

No.

Ooh, mojito.

Hey, let's get you inside safe and sound.

- Hello.
- Hi, Nana. Look, this is my new friend, Wal-

It's actually pronounced "Walden."

She's asleep.
Her head's in the toilet, but she's asleep.

I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm not the
kind of guy who brings home a drunk girl.

I mean, I did bring her home,
but not to, you know... bring her home.

We met at this video game party
and we started drinking and talking...

...and she was doing the drinking
and I was doing the talking...

...and here I am, still talking. Hi.

- I'm Walden Schmidt.
- Nice to meet you, Walden. Linda Pearson.

Thank you for helping my granddaughter.

You do not look like you're old enough
to have a granddaughter.

The unexpected benefit of being a slut
at 18.

And having a daughter who followed suit.
And, you know, from the looks of it...

...Stacey is, uh, going to carry on
the proud family tradition.

Some families hand down recipes.

I appreciate you being a gentleman.

I was looking at these photos.
They're amazing. Who took these?

- I did.
- You took all these?

Yeah, I'm a photographer. This is pretty
much a record of the last 40 years of my life.

Hold on. In this one, these guys are aiming
their machine guns at the camera...

...which means they're aiming
their guns at you.

Yeah, I was on assignment and, uh,
I needed a photo of Nicaraguan Contras...

...and I guess nobody told their
elite death squad it was picture day.

Wow.

That's what I said
when they came over the hill.

But it had a lot more F's in it.

This is a picture of
Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson.

I took some more photos in the Jacuzzi later,
but, uh, I can't display those.

Yeah, and that's the Berlin Wall coming down,
and that's Tiananmen Square...

...and this is a dachshund in a hot dog bun.

- You're really talented.
- Ha, ha. You're really sweet.

Okay, I've taken up enough of your time.
I'll get out of your way now.

You're not in my way. I was just gonna
make a cup of tea and smoke a joint.

- Really?
- Yeah, you wanna join me?

That's my idea of baking with grandma.

Dad? Walden?

Jake?

- This is a surprise.
- So is this.

What's on your face?

Oh, uh, now that I'm back dating,
I wanna look my best.

Oh. It's not working.

So, what are you doing home?

I got a few days pass, thought I'd come and
surprise you, spend some time together.

That's great. Wait, are you in trouble, is
somebody pregnant, do you need money?

No, no, and always.
Thing is, I'm going away for a while.

Damn it, I forgot jail.

- Not jail, Japan.
- Japan?

Yeah. They needed an extra cook at the base
there, so I volunteered.

- Really? Why?
- Why not? I love Benihana.

- Oh, my God. When do you leave?
- Two weeks.

Wait, two weeks. So this is probably
the last time I'm gonna see you for a while.

Yeah, I guess.
Unless you're willing to make the drive.

So Nixon stands on the helicopter steps,
right, and he does this... and I take the picture.

And I'm so excited, that I don't even notice
Strom Thurmond's hand is on my ass.

- So, what did you do?
- I became a life-long Democrat.

Wow. You've seen some incredible things.

You can get into some pretty amazing places
with a camera, a press pass, and no bra.

Okay, I'm gonna stop wearing a bra.

It's nice to have someone to talk to.

Stacey thinks Nicaragua is a gum you chew
to stop smoking.

She also thinks Mount Rushmore
is a natural phenomenon.

- It's not?
- Ha, ha.

Oh, man, I should really get going.

But before you go,
you have to do something for me.

Every person I meet
poses for the same picture.

- Oh, I'd be honored.
- Great. Okay. Now, stand by that wall.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

And, uh, give me a great, big smile.

- Now drop your pants and moon me.
- What?

That's the picture I take of everyone.

Wait, I'm still gonna moon you.

So how long is your tour of duty?
And, yes, I know I said "duty."

Uh, a year, but if I do really well,
it could be longer.

Okay, so a year.

- Hey.
- Hey, Walden.

- What are you doing home?
- Just visiting.

- He's being transferred to Japan.
- What?

That's amazing. I mean, I'll miss you,
but what a great opportunity.

Beautiful country, gorgeous women, one
step closer to having this house to myself...

Yeah, the only thing I'm worried about
is they still haven't found Godzilla.

How was the party?

It was great.
I met this really hot 22-year-old girl...

...and spent the night
talking to her grandma.

Oh, yeah, "talking to her grandma."
I know what that means.

Do you?

Are you kidding?
When I wear my uniform out...

...all the ladies let me
"talk to their grandma."

I'm just gonna talk to you.

Wait, wait...

...so you met this hot 22-year-old, but you
spent the night talking to her grandmother?

That's like going to the International House
of Pancakes and ordering dust.

Clearly I can't talk to either of you.

No. No, seriously. Why?

I'm sick of dating these goofy, shallow girls
that all have a tiny dog in their purse.

All right. Tiny dog in their purse.

I'm missing you less and less.

She's really interesting.

Is she like a rapping granny or something?

Stop talking.

She's smart, funny and she's had these
incredible experiences. There's one problem.

What? She can't drive at night?

No. If I wanna see Linda again,
I gotta see Stacey again...

...and if I see her, she's gonna want to
have sex with me.

Could you ask Walden
why that's a problem?

This is nice, huh?

Yes it is. In a truly weird way.

There's nothing weird about
three people having dinner.

It is when two of them are on a date.

Come on. We want you here.
Isn't that right, Stacey?

Huh? Yeah. Totes.

Well, in that case, I'm totes glad
to be here.

- So are you into photography too?
- Oh, yeah, I take tons of selfies.

Instagram.

So how did you two wind up
living together?

She's my grandma. Duh.

Stacey's looking for a job out here.
She just graduated from Arizona State.

- Oh, wow. What was your major?
- Communications.

You know, I've always wondered,
what is that exactly?

Well...

It's kind of hard to put into words.
I mean, you know, it's like talking and stuff.

- Uh-huh.
- A hundred and twenty grand.

Ooh. Hey, are we gonna have sex tonight?

There's that Communications degree
at work.

I hadn't really thought-

Because if not,
I just got invited to a killer party.

Well, I wouldn't wanna keep you if-

Great. My friends will swing by
and pick me up.

Do you wanna eat something first?

Oh, God, no.
I hate drinking on a full stomach.

In fact, I'm gonna go throw up
and make a little room.

- Pretty sure she's gonna live with me forever.
- I got one of those.

I think pizza's the thing I'm gonna miss
the most when I go to Japan.

Really? Pizza?

Yeah, well, that and sushi.

Okay, you know what, this is ridiculous.
You're gonna be gone for a year...

...and we're here watching
Dancing With the freaking Stars.

Well, you wanna watch
Hillbilly Gynecologist?

No! No, I don't want to watch anything.
I want to do something.

Hey, what do you say we go on
a father-son road trip?

Okay. Can we go to Vegas?

That would be great except you're not
old enough to drink or gamble.

Right. I don't drink.

You know what we could do? We could see
beloved Canadian songbird, Celine Dion.

She is to die for.

- Dad?
- Mm-hm?

I'm gonna be going away for a while.

If there's anything you need to tell me,
now's the time.

Thank you very much for dinner.

You know, I was really impressed
that you ordered in Italian.

Grazie, Signora. Molto bene.

It would have been more impressive
if we'd been in an Italian restaurant.

- I had a great time tonight.
- I did too, yeah.

Whoa.

Look, you are a wonderful young man.
But I have a rule.

I never kiss anyone who started the night
on a date with my granddaughter.

A rule? This has happened before?

What do you think?

If we take this route, we can be
at the Grand Canyon by sunrise tomorrow.

- Pretty awesome, huh?
- Yeah.

You know what else is awesome?
The Bunny Ranch.

We're not going to a whorehouse,
we're going to the Grand Canyon.

There's a girl at The Bunny Ranch
they call the Grand Canyon.

Morning.

Hey, we're going on a father-son trip.
Wanna come?

- Jake!
- What? I want it to be fun.

I can't. I'm still sorting things out with
Linda and Stacey.

Oh, right. The grandma-granddaughter
thing.

You know, if you get the mom in there,
they'll bronze your johnson.

I am so glad you're a cook,
not a sniper.

So, Japan, huh?

Yeah, the Big Apple.

Have a fun road trip.

- I'm gonna miss this. Give me a hug.
- Thanks for everything, Berta.

- You take care of yourself, Taterhead.
- Are you crying?

- No.
- Don't worry, you'll still have my dad.

Now I'm crying.

- Hi.
- Hi. Um, hmm.

Well, this is a little awkward.

- Stacey's actually out on a date.
- Oh, no. I'm devastated.

I don't think I should be alone.

Look, I'm very flattered,
but I think we covered this last night.

I brought weed.

Oh, honey, that's not weed. Come on in.

- And stop looking at my ass.
- Got it.

Isn't this great? Ha, ha.
The Harper boys, on the road.

Mothers, lock up your daughters.
Cows, prepare to be tipped.

Since when do you tip?

- Witty banter. Best thing about a road trip.
- Yeah, yeah. That and joking around.

- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

Back when you and Mom broke up...

...I thought it was your fault and I was
kind of mad at you for a long time.

Oh, Jake, well, it was very complicated,
you know, a lot of things got said-

Let me finish.

Then Mom married Herb
and then broke up with him...

...so now I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't all you.

I appreciate that.

But I'm not gonna say anything bad
about your mother.

- But you're hoping I will-
- Oh, absolutely.

So after I dropped out of college,
me and my buddy developed this software...

...and we sold it for a stupid amount.
I lost half of it in my divorce...

...so I developed some more software
and made it back- And I am freaking high.

I feel like I've been talking for over a year.

You kind of have.

So, what do you do now?

A lot of this.

Oh, Walden, you did your life backwards.

Yeah, you're supposed to spend your
youth adventurizing...

...and then you go into business.

Wait, you said "adventurizing." Ha-ha-ha.
That's not even a word.

It is now. I just inventorized it.

No, I mean it, you need to find something
exciting in your life.

Like what?

Have you ever been chased by a lion
in the Serengeti?

No, but one time I got in a slap fight with
the guy who plays Simba at Disneyland.

That counts.

Have you ever been at a voodoo ritual in Haiti
or panned for gold in the Yukon...

...or made out with Buzz Aldrin?

Do I wanna make out with Buzz Aldrin?

Oh, yeah.

You need to find that thing in your life
that you're afraid to do and just do it.

Yeah, maybe you're right.

Mm-hm.

Oh, wow.

- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no this one's on me. I'm...

No, I haven't been with anybody since
my divorce, and that was three years ago.

How is that possible?
You're a beautiful woman.

No, I was a mess. I...

...I was faithful to one man
for over 30 years...

...and, unfortunately, he was only faithful
for six months...

...and not in a row.

Well, he's an idiot for philander-izing.

What are you doing here, Walden?

You're handsome, young, rich,
you can have any woman you want.

That is what I'm doing here.

Oh, you're good. Like I said...

...I haven't been with anyone
for a long time.

I'll go slow.

You misunderstand.

I don't wanna go slow.

I wanna hurt you.

These are awesome.

They're the last of the Charlie Harper estate.

We were supposed to smoke them
when you graduated college.

- I'm really glad we took this trip.
- Me too.

I can't believe my baby boy is all grown up
and headed off to Japan.

Well, tell him to look me up,
because I'll be there too.

I'm kidding.

- I'll worry about you every day you're there.
- Don't worry about me...

...worry about the Japanese.

- Kidding? Ha.
- Huh? What?

Hey, I got you a little something.

Whoa, this is a lot of cash.

Did you rob the 7-Eleven we stopped at?

More like they robbed me. Six dollars for a
Slim Jim and a Yoo-hoo, come on.

I've been putting a little something away
here and there.

Wow, thanks.

- I wish there was more.
- I'm just surprised that there's any.

Okay, I deserve that.
I know I wasn't the best dad.

Are you kidding? We lived at a beach house
my whole life, rent free...

...and after Uncle Charlie died, we managed
to stay there. Who else could do that?

I did always make sure you had a
roof over your head.

Even if it was someone else's.

Yeah, you did. And there were a lot of
hot chicks under that roof.

You don't even wanna know
how many times I lost my virginity.

No, I- Yeah, no, I don't.

I guess what I'm trying to say is
I wouldn't want anyone else to be my dad.

Aw.

- I wish you hadn't said that.
- Why?

Now I gotta give you
the rest of the money.

Okay. So this was a good idea.

No. This was a great idea.

That move you did at the end there,
that's- Yowza.

You can thank Buzz Aldrin for that one.

- It's even better in zero gravity.
Hello? Nana?

Whoa!

Let me explain.

I'm happy for you.
You should be with an old guy.

So, what do you think?

I think if we can find a way
around this big hole...

...we can make it to the Grand Canyon.

I love you, Jake.
- I love you too, Dad.

Isn't this majestic?

Yeah. Hey, you know what else is majestic?

Alan.

Hurry up.

The girls are almost here,
and I'm a...

âª Hunka hunka rotting love. âª

Sorry, just
finishing up my costume.

Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

You never saw Pretty in Pink?

Oh, right!
You're Molly Ringwald.

Ha-ha. I-I'm Duckie.

You know, the-the best friend,
the-the scene stealer?

Some would say
the true star of the film.

Who played him, Boy George?

Hey, what do you think
about zombie Elvis, baby?

And don't be cruel.

It's great.

You look like both
the impersonator at my wedding

and my ex-wife.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

What decays in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

Oh, hey, uh, did your
friend Stacy say anything

bout the girl she's
bringing for me?

Uh, just that she's supposed
to be really cute,

and she just moved out here
after a tough breakup.

Ooh, hot, lonely
and damaged.

Duckie's getting lucky.

You know, if Duckie
really wants to get lucky,

he'll tell the girls that he's
someone that people remember.

Like Ferris Bueller.

Fine, you win again, Broderick.

God, you know what
I love about Halloween?

You can put âsluttyâ
in front of any job position,

and it becomes a costume.

Slutty nurse, slutty librarian,
slutty lunch lady.

Hey, you didn't know
Mrs. Goobadeck

from Mark Twain Elementary.

She rocked that hairnet.

My chest.

Seriously?
W-What's going on?

I don't know, I can't breathe,
my chest is tight.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Here, here. Sit down.

Um... Oh. Uh, well,
uh, don't worry.

I-I'm sure this is
nothing, but, uh...

I'm going to call an ambulance,
just in case.

Just, uh, just stay calm.

You're gonna be fine.

Help! My friend is dying!

I can't settle down, I think
he's having a heart attack.

Oh, my God, I'm having
a heart attack.

Oh. No, no.

I-I'm just saying that
to get them to hurry.

I'm not just saying that.

I think he's headed
toward the light.

I can't feel my left arm.

Um, uh, you're gonna be okay.

It's probably just gas.
Try to fart!

Trick...

Or treat.

Oh, ladies. I'm sorry, you just
got here during a bit of a...

Ooh, I can see
your nipples, officer.

Anything you see will
be held against you.

And I'm Harry Potter.

But I'm not so hairy.

She's mine.

Didn't work!

Don't worry, we're
almost to the hospital.

Sir, are you taking
any medications?

Well, I take a generic Lipitor
and a women's multi-vitamin.

I mean, just so you know,
I take the women's

'cause it has more iron.

Same price, more iron.

Yes, please.

Is he gonna be okay?

We're doing
all we can, sir.

I can't believe this is
happening, you know?

He's so young!

He leads such
a healthy lifestyle...

Well, except for all the pot.

You know, the-the weed.

The... the ganja.

The ol' Mexican spinach.

Alan, if I live,
I'm going to kill you.

Stop it. You are gonna live.

Is he gonna live?

We're en route
with a 35-year-old male.

BP is 160/94, pulse is 108.

And he's dressed
as zombie Elvis, over!

I-I don't know if you guys
need to know that.

They don't.

By the way, uh,
I'm dressed as...

Ferris Bueller?

Hey, hey, at least I took
a chance with my costume.

I mean, Elvis and zombies.

It's real original.

Next year, it's vampire Obama.

âYes, we can!â

Excuse me, do you have
anything for the pain?

In my ass?

I know, I know.

I'm just... I'm freaking out
because I'm worried.

I mean, you are my best friend.

And if something were
to happen to you,

I don't know what I would do.

I mean, I-I've already
lost a brother.

I can't lose
you, too!

A-And you're more
of a brother than he was.

And now Jake's in the Army,
and I'm all alone.

And I don't do well
when I'm alone...

Here, breathe.

Thank you.

Am I crazy, or is, uh,
something happening here?

âª Men. âª

Oh, good, uh, you made it.

Uh... Oh, I-I'm sorry I pulled
you out of your Halloween party,

I just figured you'd want to...

I wasn't at a Halloween party.

I-I just assumed,
since you're dressed...

So what happened?

I don't know.

We were about to go out,

and he got chest pains
and suddenly collapsed.

Oh, wow.

He's so young.

So fit.

So not you.

Hope he's okay.

I never thought I'd have a boss
better than your brother,

but Walden is good people.

He's the best.

The guy has the biggest heart
of anyone I have ever met.

Yep, a heart of gold.

Clogged with arterial plaque.

You've been a good
friend to Walden.

He's lucky
to have you.

He's lucky to have you,
too, Sister Berta.

And, listen, um...

if, God forbid,
the worst happens,

I-I just want you
to know that, uh...

you'll always have
a job at the house.

I mean, we'd have to talk
reduced salaries, but, uh...

What makes you think
he'd leave you the house?

I'm his best friend.

There's nobody closer
to him than me.

I clean his underwear.

I wear his underwear.

Alan Harper?

Oh, oh, that's me.

I'm Dr. Prajneep.

Your friend had a
mild heart attack.

We put in a stent to
clear the blockage.

Is that bad?

In general,

a heart attack is bad.

But, uh, he should
make a full recovery.

Oh, thank God.

Oh, that is
a huge relief.

Um, is there anything
we should do at home?

I just want to make sure
he has all the care he needs.

Uh, any special diet,
exercises, medications?

If it'd help,

I'd chew up his food and
feed him like a baby bird.

How could that
possibly help?

I'll tell you what
doesn't help-- that tone.

Can we see him?

Soon as he's
in recovery.

Any other questions?

Uh, no, we're just happy
that he's gonna be okay.

Thank you.

My pleasure.

By the way, Ferris Bueller
is my favorite movie.

Wait, B-Berta.
W-Where are you going?

We're not supposed
to go back there yet.

I'm a nun at a hospital.

I can do whatever
the hell I want.

I'm dead.

And I'm in hell.

Relax.

You're in the hospital.

You had a mild heart attack,
but you're gonna be fine.

I don't feel very good.

That's because they put
a stent in your heart.

But also I feel really good.

That's because they put morphine
in your veins.

We should start keeping morphine
in the house.

I know a guy.

Berta, you're so funny.

I would've missed you so much
if I would've died.

Oh, oh, but you don't
have to worry about that.

Y-You're not going anywhere.

I love you guys.

We love you, too.

You know, when I think about it,

you guys are
my only real family.

Oh, Walden, that's so...

Horrible.

Okay.

Saved your life, but whatever.

My life is pathetic.

I mean, thank you guys so much
for being here.

But you're not good enough!

Okay, now it sounds
like my family.

Um...

Maybe you should rest.

You know, just go
to your happy place.

I know a shortcut.

Say when.

Whe...

Dressed as a nun,
giving some guy morphine--

boy, does this take me
back to high school.

Hey, how you feeling?

I'm all right.

Well, uh, I know

something that'll
make you feel better.

I made some of my famous
three bean salad.

The secret--

I use four beans.

Garbanzo.

Shh.

You ever look out at the ocean

and think about how small
and insignificant you are?

I don't need the ocean;
I can just call my mother.

I almost died, Alan.

But the important thing is
you didn't.

So, now you just have
to listen to your doctors,

don't stress about anything
and relax.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Sorry.

That was supposed to scare the
life out of trick-or-treaters,

not you.

This sucks!

How am I the one
with a stent in my heart?

I'm healthy, I-I'm fit.

You sit in front
of the TV every night,

shoveling a pint of ice cream
down your throat.

Hey, I eat my feelings,

and you are sending me
right back to the freezer.

You know, it just goes to show,

your life can end
in the blink of an eye.

One day you're here,
the next day you're gone.

That's why I live
by the philosophy

âOne day I'm here,
the next day I'm still here.â

You know, if-if I would have
died, who would have missed me?

What are you talking about?
I would, Berta would.

A-And you just got an e-mail
from Netflix the other day

that literally said,
âWe miss you.â

You know, other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

At least you got Jake.

Well, that's true.

I'll always have
my little guy.

Although, in his last e-mail,

he, uh, asked me when the
Fourth of July was this year.

But, yes, I'm very lucky.

Do you know how much
I would give to have a kid

who didn't understand
the concept of a calendar?

All I have is money.

Yeah.

'Cause I wouldn't give up Jake
for a billion dollars.

I got to make some changes.

Changes are good.

Uh, you know,
I remember when I switched

from American Idol to The Voice.

My life turned around

like Blake Shelton's chair.

You know what?

I want to have a kid of my own.

What?

Yeah, I want something
to give my life meaning.

I want somebody
I can love unconditionally.

Someone I can teach,
someone I can nurture,

someone I can leave
all this to.

Well...

I mean, I don't know
what to say, except...

Papa?

âª Men. âª

Have you thought
this through?

Having a kid
is a lot of work.

Having you is
a lot of work.

You know, having a child
would give my life meaning.

Otherwise, all this
has been for nothing,

and that's difficult
to accept.

You know
what's difficult?

Removing a marble
your kid shoved up his nose.

I did something like that.

I jammed a penny up there.

I was trying to get a gumball
to fall out of my butt.

But a kid
is permanent.

It's not like you're dating.

You can't just stop calling
or change your number

or fake your own death
because they annoy you.

You do that to women?

No, they do it to me.

Look, I-I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm being negative,

because the truth is,
you know, kids are amazing.

But you just had
this big health scare,

and you're probably not
in the best frame of mind

to make life decisions.

I mean, this morning,
you cried at a beer commercial.

Yeah, but the horse and
the puppy were best friends!

Look,

having a heart attack
didn't make me realize

I want to have a kid,
it made me realize

I don't want to live
another day without one.

It was like a wake-up call.

All right.

If you really want to do this,
I will be here to support you.

From my room.

Which, FYI, is way too drafty
to use as a nursery.

Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

Sweet! Let's get that kid!

So, uh, who's the lucky lady

who's gonna receive your seed?

See, you just put
your creepy little finger

right on the problem.

I haven't exactly been
successful in love.

It's like I'm running JavaScript
and women are running HTML5.

Talking like that is part
of the problem, isn't it?

Yeah.

And it's weird, because
your package is perfect.

And... and by âpackage,â
I don't mean your package,

I mean your...
package.

Although, that is also
a showstopper.

Okay, I can't believe that
this is not the first time

I've said this, but stop
looking at my penis.

Well, now that
you've mentioned it,

I can't stop looking.

It's like the elephant's trunk
in the room.

Don't worry,
you'll-you'll find somebody.

And, you know,
it goes without saying

that if I could, I would
happily bear you a child.

Okay, I wish all of this
had gone without saying.

You doing okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

He wants to have a kid.
Now all he needs is a woman.

Would you consider
a pregnant stripper?

Uh, no.

Well, that rules out
both my granddaughters.

Morning. Did you
take your pills?

Yep.

Are you lying to me
or are you lying to yourself?

They're too big.
It's hard to swallow.

If you say
âthat's what she said,â

I will kill you.

You know what she said?

âTake your pills.
I care about you.â

Fine.

Do you know how long
it takes to get a baby?

Well, I know it takes, uh,
five months of mood swings

and four months of not
wanting to be touched.

And who knows what my ex-wife
was going through.

I was just
researching surrogacy,

and they say that once
you choose a great candidate,

it can take
up to three years

before you have
a baby in your arm.

I can't wait that long.

I mean, who knows if I'll even
still want a kid by then?

Tell me about it.

Six months into Jake's life,
I was like, âCheck, please!â

I was kidding.

As was I.

Okay.

I've narrowed down my options
to either adoption

or seeing if
Brad and Angelina

have an extra one
they could throw me.

Uh, you know, if you really
want to adopt...

For the last time, Alan,
I am not adopting you!

But, Papa...

Ah! All right.

I already reached out
to a lawyer

who specializes in adoption.

Well, you're a perfect
candidate to adopt.

I mean, you're highly educated,
you're likeable,

uh, you have a stable
home environment...

Financially secure,
no criminal record, handsome.

I-I don't... I don't think
handsome really comes into play.

Doesn't it, Alan?

No, I don't think so.

Doesn't it?

You're being ridiculous.

Am I?

I will steal you a baby.

âª Men. âª

So, as you can see,
finances are not an issue.

I have a lot of
extra free time,

and I know I can provide
a loving, nurturing home.

You okay?

Are you?

Seriously, do I need
to call someone?

Never mind.

What's important is that

I will coach the hell
out of the Braves.

Excuse me?

It'll be the name of
my son's tee-ball team.

Pretty Pink Ponies,
if it's a girl.

You know what,
if my son wants to play

for the Pretty Pink Ponies,
then so be it.

Tolerant.

Well, Mr. Schmidt,

you are obviously
more than qualified.

Thank you.

That said, I'd start looking

at Golden Retriever puppies,

'cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

Well, I don't understand.

You just said that
I'm more than qualified.

And you are.

But you're a single guy,

and the system is really geared
towards married couples.

That's racist.

Uh, no, it's not.

Then it's sexist.

Nope.

Well, it's some kind of âsist.â

Look, I'm not saying
it's impossible, okay?

Just that it's difficult.

You're in line behind families
that already have children,

married couples, single women...

Anyone else?

What, sweat shops? Circuses?

The Vienna Boys' Choir?

Look, I wish
I had better news, okay?

If you were married,
this would be a slam dunk.

Okay, you don't get it.

Marriage is not
an option for me.

Okay, I understand
you're frustrated...

No, what's frustrating
is that every woman I meet

runs screaming from me!

I was married before
and she left me

and I tried to commit suicide.

Don't write that down.

Why are you
writing that down?!

No, no...

Then I proposed
to two other women,

and they both shot me down.

I am incapable of maintaining

a long-term relationship
with anybody.

Now, give me a frickin' baby!

Okay.

I think we're done here.

No, we are
not done here!

I almost died wearing
a bedazzled jumpsuit

and my life
needs meaning.

Stop writing
things down!

Mmm.

Hey, how'd it go?
What kind of world...

Uh-oh.

...are we living in

where any two high school kids
with a broken condom

can screw behind
an Applebee's Dumpster,

have a baby,
give it up for adoption,

but not have it go to
an adult who is upstanding,

responsible,
and, might I add, handsome...

...simply because
every woman I meet

eventually grows to loathe me?

And because of that,
the Pretty Pink Ponies

will not have a tee-ball coach!

So it didn't go well?

No, it did not go well.

All right, well, uh,
first things first.

Uh, how about we get
you a little Zin

to calm your nerves?

It's just not fair.

I know, I know.

Uh, thank you.

Just because I'm single,
I'm not a fit parent?

Did they say that to you?

That's how I felt.

Apparently, the whole system

is geared towards
married couples.

And-and single guys
are not welcome.

Like a Studio City
swingers party.

Exactly.

Wait, what?

Nothing. So, uh, did you
tell her everything?

I mean, how you're successful,
you're warm, you're caring...

I told her everything.
Did you give her the smile?

Of course I gave
her the smile.

She thought I was
having a stroke.

So nothing worked?

No. Even if I hadn't been
escorted out by security,

I still don't think
they were giving me a kid.

Wow, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

You know, it's ridiculous.

Why-why are married people
automatically better parents?

My mom was married six
times; didn't help her.

See, and I would've been
a great dad.

I would've played
catch with him,

I would've read to him,

I would've waited
till he went to sleep

before I smoked pot.

Already got my mom beat.

But-but you shouldn't give up.

I mean, you might
still find somebody.

No, I don't want
to marry somebody

just to marry somebody.

It's got to be the right person.

Ooh, or Mila Kunis.

I get it.

That's hard to find.

Oh, that's my banana bread.

I love your banana bread.

I know.

I made it hoping
we could celebrate,

but it works on
a sad tummy, too.

Oh, what would I do without you?

I hope you never have
to find out.

What?

You are... always there for me.

Yeah, and-and you're always
there for me.

We're best friends.

What if we were
more than friends?

Like...

super friends?

Alan Harper,

will you marry me?

âª Men. âª

Are you seriously
asking me to marry you?

I can't believe
this is happening.

And I always thought Alan
would be the one on his knees.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

I'm dead.

You're in the hospital.
You had a mild heart attack.

I almost died, Alan.

But the important thing is
you didn't.

Other than you guys and my mom,
I got nobody.

At least you
got Jake.

I want to have a kid of my own.

You are obviously more than qualified.
Thank you.

I'd start looking

You're a single guy,

Alan Harper,

âª Men. âª

Wait. You seriously
want to marry me?

Yes.

Alan Jerome Harper,

would you be my wi...?

Hus...?

Life buddy?

Okay, I'm a little confused.

And not like the time I-I got
that massage from that lady-boy.

Look, I want
to adopt a kid,

and the quickest way for me
to do that is to get married.

And if I'm gonna
settle for someone,

it might as well be you.

That's exactly what
my first wife said.

Listen, I-I know
this sounds crazy,

but you would be doing me
the biggest favor of my life.

Walden, there are
literally millions of women

who would marry you
at the drop of a hat.

Yeah, but I wouldn't be
half as happy

with any of them
as I would be with you.

Go on.

When-when I think of
the ten things I want in a wife,

you have nine of them.

You're my best friend,
you're trustworthy,

you're loving, you're smart,
you'll never leave me.

Married or not, till
death do us part.

You're funny,
you're understanding.

You don't care
if I leave the toilet seat up.

I actually prefer it.

Although, the other night,
I forgot it was up,

and I had a surprise
splash-down.

I was like a
turtle on its back.

Right there. That's another one.

As long as you're around,

I will never be the most
awkward guy in the room.

So, what's the one thing

you want in a wife
that I don't have?

Oh. Right, right.

I-I do not have
one of those.

I barely have one of these.

I mean, how would
this work exactly?

I mean, we're gonna
pretend to be a couple?

We wouldn't pretend.

We're actually going
to be a same-sex married couple.

And like most married couples,
we will not have sex.

Not even on my birthday?

Sorry, sorry... flashback
to the first wife.

So, so, I can have
crazy, anonymous sex

with any woman I want?

No. You will still be you.

Oh.

Mr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.

Dr. Alan Schmidt.

What are you doing?

Oh, just trying
to see what sounds best.

Yes, Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt,

welcome back
to the Four Seasons.

Your ocean front suite is ready.

Okay, cut the Schmidt.

Oh, yeah, I'd have
to put up with that Schmidt.

But you know what?
I'm gonna own it.

I don't give a Schmidt.

What are you saying?

I'm saying, yes, I'll marry you,
you big dumb Schmidt.

Ah.

Oh, please tell me that's
ChapStick in your pocket.

Hi, Mom.
Thanks for coming over.

What is so important

that I had to leave halfway
through my bikini wax?

I look like a black
and white cookie.

Wow. In one fell swoop, there
goes cookies and vaginas.

What's going on?

Is this another
intervention?

For the millionth time, I do not
have a drinking problem.

No, Evelyn.
It's-it's a celebration.

Well, in that case,

I'll have a double martini
and hold the vermouth.

Hello. I'm Robin.
I'm Walden's mother.

Oh, how nice
to finally meet you.

You have a wonderful son
and amazing breasts.

Who did them?

God?

Well, he's still the best.

Although Dr. Schenkman
runs a close second.

They are lovely.

Okay, can everyone stop talking
about my mom's boobs? God.

Oh, my God, that's why I had
so many friends in high school.

So, what's
the big announcement?

Uh... Well...

Alan and I...

We're getting married!

Dude! What the hell! We
agreed I was gonna say it.

Sorry, sorry.
I'm just so excited.

Uh, no offense, but
can't you do better than Alan?

Back up. You are marrying him?

Yup.

Ow! What was
that for?

For marrying Zippy.

Hey! Why are you
hitting me?!

For being Zippy.

This sounds great,
except for one thing.

You guys aren't gay.

No, we're not gay.

We are getting
married because...

It'll make it easier
for him to adopt a child!

Aah, come on!

Uh, thank you, Berta.

Hold on.

You want a child?

Yes. I've been doing
a lot of thinking

about my life,
and I believe

that having a kid would
add more meaning to it.

Parenthood can be
very rewarding.

Some of the time.

So, this marriage
is just a sham?

I didn't march in all
of those gay rights parades

so you guys could make a mockery
of our hard-won civil liberties.

You marched in
those parades

so you could get drunk
and pick up chicks.

Hard-won chicks.

All right, look, we're not
making a mockery of anything,

and I get the challenges
that gay couples face,

but I-I also know that there
are a lot of kids out there

that are just looking
for a good home,

and I think we
can provide that.

And I get health insurance.

You guys are lucky
you're in California.

In some states, they still don't
let gay couples get married

or adopt kids.

You know, when
I was in Utah,

I vomited on a police officer,
and I was arrested.

Simply for being gay.

Wow, this is a lot to take in.

My son is going to get married
and have a child with...

Oh, God, where...
where did I go wrong?

âª Men. âª

Oh, there he is,
my same-sex shorty.

My friend with no benefits.

My boo.

You know, I do have 99 problems,
and you're all of them.

What's all this?

Uh, oh, I'm, uh...

I'm making a dream
board for our wedding.

Uh, there's also
a Pinterest page,

or you can go to: Alan
and Walden's big day dot com.

Yeah, I got the link
you sent me.

Uh, I really loved
the photoshopped picture

of both us peeking
around the same tree.

However, you know,

we're not doing, like,
a big, lavish wedding.

Oh, okay, I get it.

You know,
small destination wedding.

Just the two of us, the beach,
wearing leis around our necks,

matching linen shirts,
sand tickling our toes.

Seagulls flying overhead.

Ca-kaw! Ca-kaw!

And where do you see this
happening?

Well, obviously,
there's Hawaii and Cabo.

Um,

I'd be happy
with either one of those.

Um, but I hear that Greece is
fabulous this time of year.

And just FYI, Mykonos is very
friendly to same-sex couples.

Opa!

Nopa!

We're getting married
in the courthouse.

Please tell me âthe courthouse"
is a chic bar in Ibiza.

No, it's a rundown courthouse

around the corner
from the Jiffy Lube.

We'll pay 50 bucks,

we'll do some paperwork,

and if you're good,
we'll go outside

to the food truck,
and I'll buy you a gyro.

Opa!

Oh.

Okay. I see.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Talk to me.

No, it's fine.

You know, I just
wanted to make sure

this whole thing
was special for us,

for you, but, you know,
it's no big deal.

I'm sure we can
still make it special.

Maybe, uh... maybe Jenny
can take some pictures

on her iPhone.

Alan, come on.

Don't touch me.

Look, this isn't about us.

It's about bringing
a kid into our lives.

It's a simple
business transaction,

like paying an electric bill,
or buying dinner, or...

writing a rent check.

Stop me when I land on something
you've actually done.

I just got excited

because I've never had the
wedding I always dreamed of.

Right, the wedding
that every little boy dreams of.

You know, we still need
to get each other rings.

We can just get something
online.

Or we could go into
Beverly Hills and have brunch,

and go ring shopping together.

Really?

Sure.

Because I do have ideas.

âª Men. âª

Hey, Berta,

do we have any carrots?

Oh, wait. I've got 14 karats
of white gold

right here.

You'll make a beautiful
bride, Zippy.

Hey.
Hey, there's my future baby daddy!

If I got to listen to this,
I got to be a lot higher.

Hey, uh, I got some paperwork
for you to sign.

Oh, uh, and I've got some
paperwork for you to sign.

Guess it's true. Married couples
do start to think alike.

Maybe soon, we'll start to
look alike, he said hopefully.

It's the application form
for our marriage license.

Oh, look at you.
Yeah.

I guess somebody's
gonna get that money

for that Mani-pedi
he wants after all.

Ah, you spoil me.

No, I'm just trying to be
a good business partner.

The Johnson to
your Johnson.

Wait, that-that
didn't come out right.

So, uh... so what do
you need me to sign?

Uh, just this.

Oh. What's that?

Oh, it's a simple dissolution
of services agreement.

Oh! Oh, you-you mean,
like a... like a prenup?

Yup. So, it's not a big deal.

Just go ahead and sign it,
he said hopefully.

Why do we need a prenup?

And here we go.

Uh...

when couples get married,

finances become complicated,

and this just simplifies it.

Oh, does it?

'Cause it seems like
it's pretty simple right now.

You don't trust me.

Okay, that's not true at all.

Isn't it?

I mean, is this what
you really think of me?

That I'm some kind
of gold digger?

Okay, yes, I have lived here
four years rent-free.

Look, why do you have
to make this difficult?

You know, why do you make
everything so difficult?

It's like yesterday at brunch,
when you sent back the champagne

because the bubbles didn't taste
like âa mouthful of starsâ"

If it doesn't explode in
your mouth, what's the point?

You said that to the waiter,
too, and it was troubling then!

Look, I'm just trying
to protect my assets.

Oh-oh, yeah? Well, then maybe
I should protect my assets.

You know, don't worry, I'm pretty sure
that your VHS copy

of Dirty Dancing
and your complete collection

of Ghostbusters trading cards
are safe.

I am a collector
of '80s movie memorabilia.

And hobby mocking is not
an attractive color on you.

Hobby mocker.

I also have one other asset
that you cannot have,

my dignity.

Your dignity?!
Mm-hmm.

Your dignity...?
Yes.

Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
that the security guard

at the shopping mall had
to remove the bench

from outside of Victoria's
Secret because of you!

Mall flogger!

I got to tell you, I'm having a lot of
second thoughts right now.

Really? Because this is exactly
where I want to be in my life,

begging a 47-year-old man
to marry me.

Now sign the prenup!

I agreed to marry you,
but that doesn't mean you get

to shove whatever you want
down my throat

and expect me to swallow it!

Do-do you... do you even hear

the words that you are saying?!

How about these words?
The wedding's off!

I can't even get Alan Harper
to marry me.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª
Boy, this better be important.

I just saw you
two days ago.

Walden and I broke up.
The-the wedding is off.

Oh, Alan.

You had a rich husband
on the hook

and you couldn't reel him in.

What happened?

Well, he asked me to sign
a prenup and I refused.

Well, of course you refused.

The woman I paid to raise you
did not raise a fool.

Mom, I don't want his money.

Never say that again.

Is that a new ring?

Feels like Cartier.

Yes, it is.
And you know who gave it to me?

My rich husband.

When Marty and I married, the
only thing I was willing to sign

was his âdo not resuscitateâ
order.

Walden says this wedding is just
a-a business transaction.

H-How many business
transactions end

with the release of
grand monarch butterflies?

Darling, it is
just business.

He's using you
to get what he wants,

and you should be using him
to get what you want:

financial security.

I'm not doing it for
financial security.

Walden genuinely
wants a child,

the same way that I wanted
Jake and-and you wanted...

Charlie.

I just thought that
after four years together

that he would trust me
when it comes to money.

Oh, darling, after 47 years,
I don't trust you.

Maybe, uh, a-a
prenup is justified.

Maybe I am just a sponge.

A-a-a parasite.

And-and he tolerates me
because he's my best friend.

And I've let him down,

and all I want to
do is make him happy.

âBest friend.â

âHappy.â

I just have no idea where
you got these warped views

on marriage.

He wouldn't sign a prenup?

No, he got all upset
and he threw a hissy fit.

âYou don't trust me.
The wedding's off.

I'm going to
Ibiza by myselfâ"

Let's face it, the man
is simply not your equal.

If the two of you were
on a plane that crashed

in the mountains, Alan would be
the first person eaten.

On the other hand,

you're handsome,
successful, smart.

You would be eaten last.

You're just saying I'd be eaten
last 'cause you're my mom.

Well, listen, I know you're
serious about this child thing,

so I mentioned your situation
to a very cute intern at work.

You didn't.

Oh, Jessica's very amenable
to striking a business deal.

Plus,

she's already visited
Dr. Schenkman,

if you know what I mean.

Mom, that's exactly
what I don't want.

I don't even
know this Jess...

Holy Schenkman.

Look, I-I w...

No, she'd be eaten first.

Look, no, I want
someone that I can trust.

That's why I picked Alan
in the first place.

How can you possibly trust him?

He siphons gas out of your car.

Technically, I never caught him.

I just assumed that he did it

'cause the garden hose smelled
like gas

and one time he burped
near a candle

and it lit the couch on fire.

I don't know why you ever
let Alan live with you in the first place.

Uh, for starters,
he saved my life.

And... he's been
there for me,

every time that I needed him
and even times when I didn't.

The bottom line is...

he's my best friend.

Jessica could be
your best friend.

I'm not going out with Jessica.

Fine. I get it.

I do have another intern
that you might like better.

His name is Derek.
He does Pilates...

Mom, I'm not gay!

I-I just want to marry a man.

Why is that so difficult
to understand?

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Hey.

Listen...
About earlier...

Uh, that-that's,
that's my fault.

I-I totally get why I need
to sign a prenup.

I mean, there's guys standing
at freeway onramps

that make more money than I do.

You know what,
you don't need to sign it.

Despite my mother's objections

and despite everything
I've learned from...

two seasons of Basketball Wives,

I trust you completely.

That's nice, but, uh,

I already signed it
and sent it to your attorney.

Really?

Thank you. I-I owe you.

You owe me nothing.

I mean, other than two dollars
for the envelope

and $1.75 for postage.

Nothing for gas?

No, I just filled up.

Will you still be my husband?

You know I can't quit you.

Listen, I-I know
this isn't the wedding

that you've always dreamed of,

but I-I got a little surprise
for you for the ceremony.

Tell me Vera Wang
started making tuxes.

Even better.

âª When a man loves another man âª

âª Can't keep his mind
on nothing else... âª

Oh... my... God.

It's like you live
inside my dreams.

Happy wife, happy life.

Uh, fellas, can
we get this going?

There's a lot of gay couples
here who'd like to get married

before the Supreme Court
changes its mind.

Plus, this place
is crawling with cops,

and I've got six months
to a year hidden in my purse.

âª When a man loves
another man âª

Kill it, Bolton.

Hello, Michael.

You know, I have a vibrator
named after you.

Well, that's very flattering.

Would you like me to sign it?

I have a special pen.

What a coincidence.

I have a bit of
a nasty habit

of putting the tips
of pens into my mouth.

We're here
to join Walden Schmidt

and Alan Harper
in legal marriage.

Have you two written
your own vows?

No, the, uh, standard...
the standard

âfor richer, for poorerâ
actually fits us quite well.

Actually,

I've written
a little something down.

What? You didn't.

I wanted to surprise you.

Vows and Bolton?

âª When a man... âª

Not the cue, Bolton.

Today,

I'm marrying
my best friend.

Do not cry.

Keep it together, Alan.

In the last four years,
I've been through a lot.

Uh, there's been good times
and bad times.

But through it all,
you were there.

And I can't imagine
a future without you.

I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

I love you.

I love you, too.

This is the gayest wedding
I've ever been to.

I think it's beaut...
Wh-Whose hand is on my ass?

Sorry.
Sorry.

Walden,

do you take Alan to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

I do.

And, Alan, do you take Walden
to be your...

Try and stop me.

I now
pronounce you married.

You may kiss.

Oh. Oh, yeah.

Um, kiss. Right.

Let's...

Aw, what the hell.

âª When a man loves
another man... âª

âª Men. âª
Morning.

Hey. There's the old
balls and chain.

How was your
wedding night?

Much like my first one.

I spent it
masturbating alone.

You're the only guy I know

that would register
for lotion and tissues.

That was some party
last night, huh?

Yeah, it must have been.
I woke up out here.

And I'm pretty sure I'm
wearing Jenny's underwear.

Yeah.

The whole evening's
a little fuzzy for me, too.

The last thing I remember
is you doing body shots

off of Michael Bolton.

All of us did body shots
off of Michael Bolton.

Even our moms got along.

I wasn't sure they'd
click at first, but...

in the end, they
came together.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

I almost died, Alan.

But the important thing is
you didn't.

Other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

At least you got Jake.

I want to have a kid of my own.

There's no way you're getting
a baby-- you're a single guy,

and the system is really geared
towards married couples.

Alan Harper,
will you marry me?

I now pronounce you married.

You may kiss.

âª Men. âª

Um, yes, this is Walden Schmidt.

I'd like to order
a credit card for my husband,

Mr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.

Uh, yeah, and, uh,
refresh my memory.

What's the cash advance limit
on my black card?

Holy new Rolex.

Oh, oh, m-my mother's
maiden name?

Uh, I didn't really know her
before she was married, so...

Morning.

Um, uh, I'll call back later.

Charities.

It's not like the kids won't
still be starving in an hour.

Um...

Hey, I was meaning
to ask you something.

Um, what's your
mother's maiden name?

This might be easier if I just
give you my online password.

Oh.

It's âDon't order
credit cards in my name.â

Right, uh, all one word,
no spaces?

Hey, there's
the newlyweds.

I made you some
honeymoon pancakes.

Aw...

They're in the shapes
of hearts and arrows.

Oh, actually,
they're asses and...

Uh, sure--
hearts and arrows.

Alan, my arrow's twice
as big as yours.

Mine's life-size.

I'm still gonna be hungry.

I just realized,
Walden,

that I worked for you
when you were single.

And now you're married.

Maybe someday I'll be working
for you when you're a widower.

Bacon, Zippy?

So, how's the adoption
process going?

Is somebody other than Alan
calling you âDaddyâ?

It's going great.

We have a meeting with
the social services department

this week.

Nice.

So, if you do get a kid,
which room is he gonna live in?

Oh, guys, I'm kind of
a drunken slut,

I don't think I should
share a room with a baby.

Hey, what ya doing?

Oh, paperwork for our meeting
with the social worker.

Um, household
net worth.

Well, let's see, uh, you're
worth a billion dollars,

so together we are worth...

A little bit less than
a billion dollars.

Hey, so Evelyn said it's cool
if I crash at her place.

What, wait--
it was that easy?

My mom never
lets me stay there.

Yeah, she's gonna let me live
in the guest house.

There's a guest house?!

If-if you need, uh, help
moving, let us know.

Thanks, but Evelyn said
I could borrow the Range Rover.

There's a Range Rover?!

Oh, hey, uh, what should
I put down for, uh...

âWhy do you want
to adopt a childâ"

Hmm.

'Cause we're dudes,

and we don't have
baby holes?

You know you have
to sell yourself

as a real couple, right?

We are a real couple.

That's why we got married
in the first place.

Yeah, it also gave us the chance
to register at Crate & Barrel

for this fabulous stemware.

Ding.

See, you're making jokes instead

of expressing real emotion.

You're gonna have to prove that
you're a real couple, you know?

That you're in love,
that you're soul mates,

that you can't survive
without the other.

I actually can't survive
without him.

I am just saying,

I don't want to see you

put all this work in and not get

the payoff you deserve.

It's like when you get
âthe tap.â

Get the what?
The tap.

You know, when you're
in bed with a girl,

and you've been
down there for a while,

and suddenly she gives you
the old âThanks for tryingâ tap

on the top of the head.

Ah...

Oh, yeah, the tap, yeah.

I hate the tap.
Mm.

You know, I am sure
that we can be believable

as a loving couple.

- You want to see believable?
- This...

Watch.

Alan,

I'm sorry.

You have this one nose hair
that keeps going in and out.

Oh.

And I laughed because
no one could possibly love me.

âª Men. âª

Guess what I just finished.

Once again,

you don't have to tell me
every time you masturbate.

I will not apologize
for sharing my day with you.

But that is not this.

It is my essay describing

what I love about
my love about my spouse,

for our meeting
with the social worker.

Good. I'm so nervous
about this meeting

I'm somehow constipated and
wracked with explosive diarrhea.

You're not the only one
who can share his day.

Well, after she reads this,

there's no way she won't
believe we're a couple.

Okay, uh, âWalden is the most
caring person I know.

He always puts my needs
before his own.â

Uh, âWhether it's surprising me

âwith an espresso and a
chocolate croissant in bed,

âglamping in a yurt
at Big Sur,

âor sneaking up behind me
in the shower with a loofah

to exfoliate those hard-to-reach
places...â

â...he's my everything--

my husband, my lover,
my friend.â

âMy Wally Bear.â

My God.

I know.

Now read me yours.

Okay, um...

âAlan is my best friend.â

Loving it!

âHe's 47 years old.

âHe used to be a chiropractor.

âHe has never been
convicted of a felony.

And his favorite meal
is swordfish.â

Are you kidding me?

That's what you love about me?

That I've never
been convicted of a felony?

I told you it's
a work in progress.

What do you want me to say?

He masturbates
with impressive frequency?

At least that would show
you're paying attention.

And, by the way--

my favorite meal
is red snapper.

Hi, Alan.

Walden.

Lyndsey, what's, uh,
what's going on?

I-I thought you were
in rehab.

I was, I-I got out
a couple days ago.

Oh, well, that's great.
C-Come on it.

How'd it go?

It was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

But-but on the plus side,

it was right up the
street here in Malibu,

so ocean views,
spa, chef,

it was like
a five-star hotel.

Except they take
your shoelaces.

Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

So, I'm just gonna go
in the kitchen

and pretend I'm not listening.

Um, so, Lyndsey,
I-I'm so proud of you.

Uh, how are you doing?

I'm good.

Um, I-I just got my 60-day chip.
Oh.

And part of my recovery
is to make amends

to the people I've hurt.

So,

I apologize for everything I did
to you while I was drinking.

Oh, well, I appreciate that, um,

but some of the things
you did to me,

you don't have to apologize for.

I mean, we had sex
in a Chipotle.

I ate my burrito,
you ate my burrito.

I ate your taco.

And I later threw up
in your car.

Yes, uh, but chunks weren't the
only thing you blew that day.

Um, there is one other thing.

If-if I haven't burned
too many bridges,

I was wondering if maybe you
and I could give it another try.

Oh, wow.

Wow, that-that
is flattering.

Um, it's just...

You're seeing somebody else.

Uh, kind of, um...

Uh, uh, I'm...

You're married?!

That doesn't make any sense.

Who is she?

Uh...

Uh, she is-is
actually, uh, a âheâ"

Um...

It's... it's Walden.

Oh, my God.

Walden's gay?!

âª Men. âª

So, I guess what
I'm interested in is

how you two got together.

Uh, well, w-we met
at the dog park.

His Labradoodle
sniffed my shih tzu.

I remember when I proposed.

I-I got down on one knee,

and I looked up
into his beautiful...

...blue eyes,

and I asked him to share
his life with me.

I guess what
I'm getting at is the fact

that you've both been
married to women before.

So, when did you realize
you were gay?

Oh, well, on some level,
I've always known. Um...

I mean, throughout, uh,
both of my marriages,

I was in complete denial.

Um, but after I met Walden,

I finally felt safe
to-to be myself.

Uh, I remember
our first date.

Uh, we went to the Bowl to
see the Grease sing-along.

Ah, âTell me more,
tell me more.â

Well, uh, Walden was
dressed as Danny Zuko,

uh, and I was Sandy--

uh, hot Sandy, you
know, in the leather.

No, no, no, I was doing
the song, you know--

âª Tell me more,
tell me more... âª

Oh, my God!

Did I miss a show tune cue?!

Somebody take away my gay card.

And how about you, Walden?

When did you know you were gay?

I guess my first clue was
when I saw Basic Instinct.

All my friends were looking up
Sharon Stone's skirt,

and I was just looking
at her shoes.

And I guess I got married
because of social pressures,

but, eventually,
I had to be true to who I am.

And I've never
looked back since.

Unless I'm behind him.

That's a good one.

Ah...

You two are
an interesting couple.

Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

but you two are
different somehow.

I'm not sure what it is.

Well, uh, maybe it's the fact

that I-I look like I'm wearing
makeup, but I'm not.

Y-You know, we may not be
like other couples, but...

I know we can be
good parents.

I get that, but it is my job

to be a hundred percent sure
before I place a child.

No, n-no,
look, look...

I-I know we can provide
unconditional love to a child,

a-and w-we can create a safe,
secure environment, and...

What do people
that get kids say?

How about this--

how about I come out
to your house?

We normally do
a site visit anyway.

This way I could get to know
you guys a little better.

Yeah, great, yeah,
why don't you come on over,

and you'll see that we're
j-just a normal loving couple.

Right, sweetie?

That-that's right,
Wally Bear.

I love this guy.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Oh, flowers.
Nice touch.

Gives the house a homey feel.

They're for you.

Really?

I'm, uh, actually a lily man.

Uh, but they're very nice.

Alan, listen.

Jenny was right.

We are not believable
as a loving couple,

and I think that's why Miss
McMartin wasn't sure about us.

Now, this has
to be real.

And that includes--

being comfortable with
physical affection.

Like this.

Come on.

Loosen up.

I-I'm loose, it just feels
a little forced, that's all.

Okay, well, let
it be natural.

Just snuggle into
these broad shoulders.

I do feel safe.

Damn right, you do.

You're with
your Wally Bear.

Now, look
into my eyes.

Like this?

Yeah, exactly.

And don't look away.

We love each other.

You're at home.

Oh, I just noticed a little
green fleck in your right eye.

It's like a-a downy
patch of moss

on the trunk
of a majestic oak.

Thank you.

Sometimes I worry that I'm not
good-looking enough for you.

Come on.

You're perfect just
the way you are.

My Alley Cat.

A nickname.

Sometimes...

I worry that you don't know
how much you mean to me.

I want to be
your everything.

All right, yeah!

That was convincing.

We do that in front
of Miss McMartin,

we'll get ten babies.

Yeah, yeah.

That was good enough
to fool just about anyone.

âª Men. âª

So, this is
our kitchen.

We love to
cook together.

Uh, correction,
I love to cook,

he loves to eat.

See? This is what
I wanted to see.

The two of you just
being yourselves.

Happy, relaxed.

Oh, I'll get that.

If you really want
to see us relaxed

you should come by
for brunch someday.

The Mary's are bloody
and the Lorraine's are quiche.

Oh, I can see why
you fell in love with him.

Really?

What did you see exactly?

Alan!

Lyndsey?

Um, have you
been drinking?

Uh, ding-ding-ding,
we have a wiener...

Whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, shh!

W-What are you
doing here?

Well, you said
you and Walden

are just getting married
to get a kid.

So, there's no reason you can't
have sex with me on the side.

You know, the âDL.â

That means âDo Lyndsey.â

Okay, okay, okay, this
is not a good time.

Uh, the-the social
worker's here.

Oh, that's great!

I can help you guys.

I can tell her that
you'll be good parents.

And I know because
I'm a g... Oh.

...mother.

Okay, um...

maybe-maybe we should go
to my room a-and talk.

I won't be able to talk much,
'cause my mouth will be full.

Wink, wink.

Hopefully with breath mints.

You wait in here and I will
call a cab to take you home.

My home is in your pants.

What happened? Why did
you start drinking again?

Well, 'cause you married Walden.

The only person in your life
who's prettier than me.

But you know we're just
doing that to get a kid.

Yeah, but if I wasn't
so screwed up last year,

then we would still be together.

Then we could get married
and have a baby.

We could sell that baby
to Walden.

'Cause let's face it,

we don't want to raise
another kid,

'cause both our kids suck.

Okay, uh, refreshing,
drunk honesty aside,

um, d-don't blame yourself.

We all made mistakes.

But we shouldn't let those
mistakes ruin things for Walden.

Shh. You talk too much.

Let's party.

Lyndsey? Lyndsey?

Wow, a half-naked drunk girl
is in my bed and I'm leaving.

Maybe I am gay.

I like to imagine the
family gathered here,

eating an all-organic,
gluten-free meal

of quinoa salad
and kale chips

while watching the
original reality TV:

a beautiful
ocean sunset.

As long as this is a stable
environment for a child,

I don't care
if you're eating Hot Pockets

and watching Honey Boo Boo.

Uh, uh, Wally Bear, uh, can
I borrow you for a minute?

Is it an emergency,
Alley Cat?

Uh, it's more of a-a pickle, uh,
that needs immediate attention.

Oh, it's okay. Go.

Yeah, I would never come between
a man and his husband's pickle.

Lyndsey's here.
She's drunk.

Why?

She wants to have sex with me.

Why?

Wait... Where is she?

She's passed out in my room.

Okay, okay, we-we need
to get Ms. McMartin

out of here as fast as we can.

Right, right. Oh, um,
by the way, when Lyndsey

tried to kiss me,
I was totally into it.

I don't know why I was worried.

Worried about what?

Nothing. Let's get her
out of here.

Mm. Everything okay?

Yes, we just had to reset the...
The, um...

...flaven
on the stave.

But, uh, everything's

okay now. Uh, c-can
I get you anything?

Like directions for
your drive home, or...

You know, I actually
do have to get going.

I did not realize it was this late.
What?

No.
Oh.

I'm so disappointed.
Oh.

I'll just get your things
and walk you out.

Oh. There we go.

I got to say,
you look at that view

and you never want to leave.

And yet you must.

Unless you want to adopt me.

You're so funny.
Here's your jacket.

Oh, my God.

What?
Uh...

This jacket,
it's-it's fantastic.

What is this, wool?
I think so, yeah.

Really? Because I... I would've
thought it was linen.

Doesn't it feel
âlinen-syâ, Alan?

No, it's
definitely wool.

Holy crap.
What?

Uh... I forgot to
flip the cushions

on the deck
furniture.

Imagine the
mildew.

Alan.

Milady.

Here we go,
almost got it.

If you could
just stay still...

Yeah... Oh.

Uh, all right, that's it.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

Actually, it was a lot harder
than it needed to be, but...

That's what he said.

Uh, well...
Oh, your purse.

Well, thank you, guys.

Uh, you'll be hearing
from me soon.

Got it. Bye.

Oh, my God.

Is Lyndsey okay?

Oh, sure. She's practically
indestructible when she's drunk.

I've seen her fall down
a flight of stairs

and not spill her mojito.

I'm so sorry,
I forgot my phone.

Oh. Here it is, right
here on the table. Hey.

Oh, hey. Ho!

Got it. And
get the hell out of here.

Oh, one last thing. Um, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

but unless something
crazy happens,

you're gonna get approved.

Seriously?

Get out of here.

Seriously.

I'm here to help
with the baby.

Seriously?

Who is this?

Uh, uh, she is...

Oh, you know what,
this happens all the time.

Tourists get an out-of-date
map to celebrity homes.

Honey, Charlie Sheen
doesn't live here anymore.

Lyndsey?

Hi.

And who is this?

I fell down
in the sand.

This is...

I'm the next-door
neighbor. Hi.

Uh, we were having
a get-together

and this one got away.

Our next-door neighbor.
That... Oh, that's right,

I remember you

from the Fourth of
July block party.

Yeah... Oh, which, by the way,
is amazing for kids.

A waterslide,
shaved ice.

My waterslide's
shaved.

Okay, time to go home.

And, um, you know what?

These guys are great.
Ask anyone on our block.

We're all pulling for them
to get a kid.

Thank you.
You're very sweet.

Okay, here we go.

No, where are you
taking me?

To get a drink.

Aw, you're
my best friend.

Boy. Glad I never
gave her a baby.

You and me both.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hey.
Alan,

what is the one thing

you've never gotten
from your mother?

Uh, let's see, uh,
love, respect,

a home-cooked meal,
breast milk, um...

Okay, this is gonna
take too long.

Approval.

Wait, are-are you
trying to tell me

Ms. McMartin
approved us to adopt?

Yeah.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
that's great.

I am really happy for you.

Thank you. I-I couldn't
have done this without you.

And so, to say thank you,
I got you a little something.

Oh, you didn't have to.

Oh, my God.

Tickets to the Grease
sing-along at the Bowl.

You can take anyone you want.

âª You're the one that I want âª
Aw!

âª You are the one I want,
ooh, ooh, ooh, honey âª

Fine.

âª We'll go together
like... âª

Oh, my God, I'm turning
into my husband.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Hey!

Oh, hey, morning, Berta.

Little warning, man at work.

Doing a little banging
and screwing.

Little warning for you.

Woman at bar until 2:00 a.m.
doing the same thing.

What are you doing?

I am baby-proofing
the house.

It's a requirement
of the adoption agency,

and it's a good thing, too.

This here kitchen
is a death trap.

Whole mess of things up in here
that can kill someone.

We got knives, we got fire,
poison, scalding hot water,

Alan's leftover fish tacos.

You worry too much.

Jake ate a steady diet
of floor wax and detergent,

and he turned out...

Yeah, maybe it's not a bad idea.

I locked all the cabinets
and the drawers,

put these safety knobs
on the stove,

and if you want to access
any chemicals,

you will need
a special magnetic key.

Oh, by the way,
when you're doing the laundry,

keep your eye out
for a special magnetic key.

Why would you need
to lock the towel drawer?

You hide your pot
in the medicine cabinet.

I'm guessing.

That is no ordinary
towel drawer.

That's the first step
on the stairway to disaster.

Oh, I'm too hungover
for this crap.

Okay, okay.

All right, imagine, if you will,
child pulls out the drawer,

climbs up onto the counter
and toddles over to the window

that has been left open

because Alan finds the smell
of steaming broccoli

to be "gaggy."

Whereupon, the child

spots a beautiful kite,

most likely in the shape
of a butterfly or a Pikachu.

The child reaches
for the kite,

tumbles out the window,

bounces off the awning,
flying through the air,

heading toward certain death,
when, miraculously, it is caught

by a shirtless
Matthew McConaughey.

"Don't worry,
your baby's gonna be all right,

all right, all right."

Yeah, sure.

You know what,
we got lucky this time,

but we can't depend
on McConaughey every time.

Okay, I'm gonna have to start
hiding the pot from you.

Better safe than sorry.

Every stairway, every toilet,
every sharp corner

has been locked,
latched or padded.

No one is getting hurt
in this house.

Hot!

Hot! Hot!

All right, all right,
all right.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,

So, as you can see,

I installed a gate
at the top of the stairs,

at the bottom of the stairs,
and as an extra precaution,

I put one in the middle
of the stairs.

Overachiever.

I think he's just trying
to keep me from getting away.

Well, you did a great job
baby-proofing.

I can't imagine anyone
getting hurt in this house.

Really? Try telling me
I look fat in these jeans.

Okay, flame off,
Human Torch.

So, uh, so, what do we do next?

Oh, well, it's pretty simple.

I walk out onto the deck,

you put a pile of hundreds
on the table,

I come back,
slip them into my purse,

and you get a kid.

I have $5,000 in the bottom
of a toolbox in the garage.

I was joking.

As was I.

Anyway, uh,
I wasn't gonna say anything

until you guys passed
the inspection,

but it looks like
we may have found

a potential match
for the two of you.

We're...

We're getting a baby.

Are you serious?
This is unbelievable.

Well, slow down;
all that's happened so far

is a pregnant mother has seen
your profile

and wants to meet you.

Somebody saw my profile
and wants to meet me?

That's so different
than the dating sites.

I can't believe this.

Who is she?
Where is she from?

How old is she? Is she
having a boy or a girl?

Wait, no, la-la-la-la-la!

I don't want to know.
I want to be surprised.

Walden, you're getting ahead
of yourself.

Did you say girl?

I thought I heard
you say girl.

Wait, no, you know what?

Doesn't matter.

Ten fingers and ten toes--

that's all that matters.

Are you not saying anything
'cause it's a boy?

Oh, my God,
we're having a boy!

Okay, Walden,

when you meet the mother,

you want to come off as a calm,
stable father.

Not like a 14-year-old girl

at a Justin Bieber concert.

Sorry,
we're just really excited.

No, I get it.
I'm excited for you.

I'll call you
when the meeting is set up.

Oh, and by the way,

I think you look fantastic
in those jeans.

Girl, we are gonna be BFFs.

We're gonna have a baby.

We're gonna have a baby.

We're gonna have a baby.

We're gonna have a baby!

We're gonna have a baby!

Oh, we have to celebrate.

Uh, I'll go to the garage
and get some champagne.

Great! We're gonna have a baby!

We're gonna have a...

Wait, we don't have champagne
in the garage.

My toolbox!

Alan!

âª Men. âª

Here.

I got this for you.

Why?

I think it would be nice

if we wore matching sweaters
to meet the birth mom.

Twinsies.

We're supposed to be
a married couple,

not half of
a barbershop quartet.

Can't we be both?

âª Miss McMartin,
bring me a kid âª

âª Bom-bom-bom-bom âª

âª Marrying you
was a dumb thing I did âª

âª Bom-bom-bom-bom. âª

You were flat.

So, the mom--
you think she's hot?

She's nine months pregnant!

I know.

Love me some preggos.

38-62-38.

Baby got back and front.

Okay, listen.

If we want this girl
to give us her baby,

she has to think that
we're a well-adjusted couple.

If she gets a creepy vibe
off of you,

she's gonna turn and run
the other way.

And I'm only saying this

'cause I'm getting a creepy vibe
off of you.

Says the guy who Googled
"Helen Mirren nip slip."

Helen is timeless.

Now, listen.

If you mess this up for me,

I will make your life
a living hell.

Now, remember,
we love each other.

Hello, Mama.

Hi.

Hi, you must be Kathy.

Yes, uh, welcome to
our Malibu dream house.

He's Ken.

Oh, I guess that
makes me Barbie.

I'm Walden.

This is Alan.

Come in.

Here, c-can I take your coat?

Oh, thank you.

Wow!

Look at you!

So very pregnant.

Coat.

I know.

I haven't seen
my feet since July.

Am I wearing matching shoes?

Um...

actually, no.

Uh, but you know what, it works.
It's cute.

Um, please sit.

Yeah, please.
How you feeling?

My ankles are swollen,

my back hurts,
and forget about my breasts.

I haven't even noticed,
you know, 'cause I'm gay.

That's...

That's my rainbow warrior.

Always waving his flag.

Even when it relates
to nothing.

Um, so, uh,
tell us about Kathy.

I think the first thing
you should know about me

is this is not representative
of who I am.

See, I just graduated

from UCLA.

The baby is a result
of a spring break trip to Vegas.

Ah. I guess what happens
in Vegas

stays in Kathy.

Yep, took me about six weeks
to figure out

that my morning sickness

wasn't just
a really bad hangover.

Well, we all make mistakes.

One morning,
I woke up married to this one.

See, bottom line, this wasn't
part of my five-year plan.

You know, law school,
clerk for a judge,

start my own practice.

Wow, that's-that's impressive.

Uh, Alan's son, Jake,

had a five-year plan
for the tenth grade.

See, that's why I liked
your profile.

You have parenting experience.

Your sense of humor
came through.

And I kind of love
that you're gay.

Not as much as we do.

Right, Wally Bear?

That's right, Alley Cat.

Even though I'm not gonna
be part of the baby's life,

I like the idea of being
the only mom.

I can totally understand that.

Probably because my mom was an
ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic

who preferred shopping and spas
over spending time with me.

And I can
totally understand that.

So, tell me about you.

What made you guys decide
to start a family?

Uh, well, raising my son

was one of the greatest
experiences of my life,

and I just wanted Walden
to feel that same joy.

Yeah, I mean, for me
it's a couple reasons.

I-I felt like something
was missing in my life,

and I wanted to give back,

and having a kid will allow me
to drive in the carpool lane.

and having a kid will allow me
It's nice to laugh again.

Except I just peed a little
on your sofa.

I'll get you something.

Oh, uh, actually,
I got something right here.

âª Men. âª

The baby just kicked.

I felt it.

Oh, looks like someone's got

a little soccer star in there.

God, you smell good.

Alan, you want to come up
for some air?

Oh, sorry.

Just got excited.

About the baby.

Sure.

So, uh, Kathy,

uh, do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

I don't, but your profile said

you didn't have
a gender preference, right?

Oh, that's right.

Just like me in my 20s.

You guys crack me up.

You're gonna make great dads.

Oh, world's greatest, according
the coffee mugs I bought.

Well, that's good,
because I made up my mind.

I want you to have my baby.

No!
Yes.

Oh, my God!
You did not just say that!

You bitch!

Thank you, Kathy.

Thank you, Vegas.

Thank you, broken condom.

Well, you can thank
two-for-one tequila shots

at the Tropicana.

Let's not forget
this little guy.

Do you feel it moving?

I can feel it growing.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Okay, best shower gift:

Barry. Baby's first bong.

Yep.

And just like the kid's diaper,

it's full of
stinky green stuff.

The pizza's on its way.

In the meantime, uh,
who wants a beer?

Oh, wow.
Yeah.

There we go.

Walden, you are gonna
make a great dad.

Hey.
And, Alan,

you've already raised Jake,

so I guess just...
do the opposite.

I still can't believe
it's even possible

for two men to have a baby.

What an age we live in.

Science, right?

Larry, we're-we're not
actually having a baby.

We're adopting.

Ah, shooting blanks, huh?

Well, I guess
if Alan gets pregnant,

you'll know he's been
cheating on you.

So you two are
really married, huh?

Yep.
Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

No, I'll tell you what's crazy.

You have never
hit on me once, Walden.

I mean, we worked together
every day, side by side,

and not so much as
a lingering glance

or a "Gee, you look
nice today, Barry.

"You lost a little weight,
Barry?

Those cargo shorts really
flatter your calves, Barry."

No, man.

We got married
so I could adopt a baby.

That... we're a pretend couple.

It's kind of like your
"girlfriend in Canada."

Okay, Olivia is real.

I mean, just... Okay, look at
these nude photos she sent me.

That's Jennifer Lawrence.

She gets that all the time.

In a couple days,
I'm gonna be a dad.

I'm gonna be
completely responsible

for the emotional
and financial well-being

of someone who is
completely incapable

of taking care of themselves.

Thank you for being
my test baby.

I'd keep my fingers
crossed for a boy.

Why?

Well, basic math.

If you have a boy, you only
have to worry about one penis.

You have a girl, you have
to worry about them all.

Either way,
you're gonna love it.

Being a father is
the best thing in the world.

How old are your kids?

Well, my son is 15

and my secret daughter
is going to be 11 this year.

Your... your
secret daughter?

Yeah, she looks a lot
like my secret wife.

You know, kids are amazing.

You know? You get to pass
all this knowledge down

to this little person
and-and shape their mind.

Like, you know,
how to talk to girls

and how to be there for
your friends when they need you.

Oh, you can teach them
your ability

to always be in the bathroom
whenever the dinner check comes.

That's pure instinct.

Can't be taught.

You know, all my memories
revolve around my dad.

The time he threw my Tamagotchi
down the garbage disposal.

Time he made a pass
at my prom date.

Time he divorced my mom
and married my prom date.

Guys.

Guys, it's
the hospital.

Oh, if it's one of
my patients, I'm not here.

Oh, don't worry.
If I'm your

kid's doctor,
I won't do that.

It's what you say.

Kathy's in labor!

We got to go!

I'll get an Uber.

I'll go grab the car seat.

I'll get the
diaper bag.

Oh, God, that's the pizza guy.

Um... hey, Alan,

could you pay
the pizza guy?

I'm in the bathroom!

How does he do it?

âª Men. âª

Hey, you know,
I-I appreciate you guys coming,

but you really
don't have to stay.

Are you kidding?
We want to be here.

You know what
they say.

"To raise a child, it
takes the Village People."

Hey, guys?

I think I may have
gotten way too high.

Can somebody take me
to the hospital?

You're in a hospital.

Whoa.

How'd you do that?

I wonder why
we haven't heard anything.

They took Kathy to the delivery
room, like, an hour ago.

Sometimes the baby just
doesn't want to come out.

I mean, put yourself
in its position.

For nine months,
you've been floating

in the world's
nicest waterbed.

Then somebody opens a trap door,
all the water flows out,

a set of salad tongs grabs you
by the head and yanks you out,

and then some guy
you never seen before

starts slapping
you on the ass.

Reminds me of a trip
I took to Tijuana once.

Aw, look at how cute
that one is.

Yeah, she's got
a nice rack, too.

What are you looking at?

The hot nurse.
What are you looking at?

That baby.

Ugh! You guys are sick.

So have you guys decided
on a name for the baby yet?

Oh, no, not yet.
No.

It's such a big
responsibility.

I don't want
to give him a name

that other kids
can make fun of.

Well, bad news.
Every name can be made fun of.

That's not true.

Really?

How's your pond, Walden?

It's an intellectual insult,
but it still stings.

I was "Larry the fairy"
all through high school.

Oh, no way!
I was "Barry the fairy."

Somebody noticed
that you could rearrange

the letters of "Alan,"
and I became

"Little Anal Harper."

My name's "Herb."

Kids skipped the clever puns

and just shoved my head
down a toilet.

Well, I'm sure
there are plenty of names

that kids can't
make jokes about.

Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt?

Yeah, nothing to
worry about there.

Just the hyphenated last name
of the two gay dads.

So how's Kathy?

She's doing fine.

So is your brand-new baby boy.

Oh, my God,
we got a boy!

I get a do-over for Jake!

I only have to worry
about one penis!

I like to wear
women's underwear!

What?

I thought we were
confessing things.

There he is.

Aw...

He's got your nose
and Alan's eyes.

Larry, I told you
before that...

Thank you, Larry.

Look at him.
He's so amazing.

I can't think of
anything more beautiful

than what I'm looking
at right now.

Yeah. Mm-hmm.
It's true, that's the truth.

But how much more
beautiful would it be

if those two nurses just
started making out right now?

Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

How you doing?

I'm good.

Tired.

Sore.

Look at this little guy.

Can I hold him?

Uh, sure.

Oh, he is the cutest thing ever.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, hey... high-five.

You can owe me.

Welcome to the world,
little buddy.

We're gonna have
so much fun.

We're gonna go to
ball games together

and go swimming together

and pick up chick... ens
together.

Smile. Come on.

Okay, uh...

Oh, oh, oh.
Look at that picture.

The two most handsome
men in the world.

And they're both mine.

Oh, oh...

Oh, what's the matter?

Uh, maybe he wants his mommy.

Oh, all right,
come here, little buddy.

Uh, I think he might be hungry.

Oh, of course.

Oh, yeah, of course.

Okay, here.

There.

I miss him already.

Yeah, it's hard to let him go.

Actually, it's impossible.

Oh.

I am so sorry.

Wait. What, uh...
what just happened?

Did I... did I
miss something?

She's keeping the baby.

Uh...

But what-what
about law school?

The-the five-year plan?

After I saw this little guy...

the plan changed.

I mean, before, I couldn't
imagine my life with him.

Now I can't imagine it
without him.

But... but he's gonna
be a great dad.

Alan...
No, no. H-He loves him.

Alan, it's...

Okay, let's-let's just
approach this practically.

Um... how much for the kid?

Uh, I have, uh,

I have $32 on me.

I'm gonna need three dollars
for dinner at ampm,

but the rest is yours.

Believe me, I feel terrible.

You feel terrible?

We're-we're gonna be driving
home with an empty car seat.

And you know what's waiting
for us when we get there?

An empty nursery.
An empty crib.

An empty... uh, uh....

What's that Swedish thing

that, uh, that you
wear like a pouch,

to carry your baby
around like a kangaroo?

Bjorn.

An empty Bjorn!

An empty blue baby Bjorn!

Hard to say,
but even harder to face.

Alan, just... stop.

It's okay.

I wouldn't be able
to give him up either,

so I don't blame you.

Really?

I get it.
You're his mom.

I'm so sorry to put you
through all this.

Don't be sorry.

He's... lucky.

You're both...
very lucky.

This man is a saint.

A damn saint.

Let's go.

Say good-bye, Elliot.

More like "Smelliot."
Alan.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

You doing okay?

Yeah.

Can you show me
the picture of him?

Oh, please, don't put yourself
through this.

Come on, just
one more time.

Okay.

Here.

Look at him.

He's perfect.

I'm sorry this didn't work out
as planned.

He still owes me a high-five.

Don't worry.

We'll find our kid.

I know.

In the meantime,
you're still married to me.

Yes, I am.

Why couldn't Kathy take you
and give me the baby?!

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Thanks for coming in, guys.

It's always
a pleasure seeing you.

I mean, she's so pretty.
You're so pretty.

You know anyone
we can set her up with?

I appreciate the thought,
but I am perfectly happy

with my... cats.

Anyway...

how would you guys feel
about adopting an older child?

Wow. Like, how old
are we talking?

Like, I've been taking care
of this one since he was 43.

He's been a
wonderful provider.

And he only spanks me
when I ask him to.

Wow, that is a lot to take in
before 10:00 a.m. on a Monday.

That's what he said.

Okay, please stop.

That's what he said.

Oh! The reason I bring it up
is because there is

a six-year-old boy
who's been bouncing around

the foster system for a while,

and I think he'd be
a great match for you guys.

Wow, really?

Uh, well, six
is a great age.

Potty-trained
but not ashamed of you yet.

Well...

well, uh, can we adopt him
right away?

Well, we'd start
with a weekend visit.

See if it's a good fit,
then, assuming it is,

you guys would become
his foster parents.

After six months,
if everyone agrees,

you can officially adopt him.

Oh, and-and-and
if we don't agree,

can we credit those six months
to a kid that we do like?

Wow, I-I always thought
we were gonna get a baby,

but I kind of like the idea
of giving an older kid a shot.

Well, Louis certainly
deserves a shot.

Louis?

Louie?

Aw, sweet Lou.

Lou!

Uh, is he married to that name
or can we change it?

Alan.

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I just, you know,
I had my heart set on Beckett.

Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you guys.

Louis has had a rough time.

He's been in foster homes,
group homes.

He's moved around a lot.

We thought we had him
placed for adoption

a few months ago,
but it fell through.

So he's gonna be
a little gun-shy.

Well, don't worry about that.

I mean, I'm sure we'll have
a great time together.

Just don't expect a lot.

Same thing I told this one
on our wedding night.

Wow, I really like this idea.

I mean, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have a son.

How cool is that gonna be?

I mean, and-and
you get to relive

all those great
father-son moments.

âª By the time
you hear the siren âª

âª It's already too late âª

âª One goes to the morgue
and the other to jail âª

âª One gets wasted
and the other's a waste... âª

Good thinking.
Aah!

Dad?
Yeah, buddy?

Bite me.

Yeah, all those

great father-son moments.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Ah. âª

What the hell?

- Walden?
- Up here!

Check it out!
Isn't this awesome?

They have one just like it
at the Google headquarters!

Oh, you know what you get
when you Google

âgreatest dad in the worldâ?

This guy!

What is going on?

What is all this?

Oh, uh, well,
I went to the toy store

and got a few things for Louis.

âA few thingsâ?
Okay, I don't want to be the guy

to point out the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

But there's an 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

I just want him to like it here.

Well, so do I.

But if you build Disneyland
in your house,

you'll never get the thrill
of taking him to Disneyland.

Ah. You're right.

Damn it. I got to cancel
Mickey and Minnie.

What?

Oh, I was gonna have him

wake him up in the morning.

Hey, Louis.

Ready for breakfast?

We've got orange juice

and waffles shaped just like me!

I think it's great that you're
so excited about being a dad.

And the best part is...
no stretch marks for me.

You know, you're my best friend,

but you're an odd little man.

âª Men. âª

Oh, hey.

What are you doing up?

I couldn't sleep.

Oh, I get it.
Excited about tomorrow?

More like terrified
about tomorrow.

Why are you getting paper towels

in the middle of the..
Oh, you... Never mind.

I don't want to know.

That's a good call.

You want to talk about it?

There's a kid
showing up here tomorrow.

And he needs a dad,
and I don't know if I can do it.

What? Why not?

Well, I've never had
a successful relationship

with anyone in my life
except for you.

Four years next Thursday.

Yeah, I got your wish list.

They're just ideas.
Make it your own.

Look, the fact that you've
screwed up with women

doesn't mean you can't
be a great father.

I don't even know
what a good dad looks like.

I mean, I know
what a bad dad looks like.

It's an empty chair
across the table from my mom.

Which later gets filled
by my âUncle Kennethâ

who sold speedboats.

And âUncle Robâ
who sold insurance.

Then âUncle Stanâ who sold pot.

I liked Uncle Stan.

I get it. I didn't grow up
with a dad, either.

When Jake was born,
I was scared out of my mind.

Why were you scared?
You're a great dad.

Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

that I've, I've never
told anybody before.

When Jake was a baby...

I dropped him.

Right smack on his head.

Oh, my God.

Now I feel awful
about all the times I said,

âWere you dropped
on your head as a baby?â

My point is
that Jake turned out fine.

I mean, sure, he had to repeat
seventh grade math

a couple of times, but he was
born at the right time.

You know? Computers.

Wait, so what you're saying is

even if I screw up a little,
it's not the end of the world?

The fact that you're worried
about being a good dad

is what's gonna
make you a great one.

Thanks.
Hmm.

You're a good friend.

All right.

I'm gonna go get some sleep.

Good night.
Good night.

Oh, Baby Jake.

âª Men. âª

It'll be nice having
a kid around here again.

Running up and
down the stairs.

Laughing at all
the silliest things.

And they'll believe almost
anything you tell them.

No kidding.

Jake still thinks
one of the first men

on the moon was
Buzz Lightyear.

Ha!

I'll get it!

You got to admit that would've
been way cooler with a slide.

Look who's here.
Hi, guys.

This is Louis.

Hi, Louis!
Sweet Lou!

Lou!

We're not booing,
we're Lou-ing.

Louis, this is Walden and Alan.

Hi.

You're gonna be staying

with them for the weekend.

Oh, uh, don't worry, buddy,

I was only supposed
to stay here for a weekend, too.

12 years later.

Oh, and, uh,

this is Berta.
Uh, she helps

take care of us around here.

Look at that face.

Walden, you might have
some competition

for the best looking
man in the house.

You mean so-some
more competition?

Nope.

Do you have any Cheez-Its?

Uh, well, if we don't,
we could get some.

Okay, I'll stay.

All right, well,
I want you guys

to get to know each other,
so I'm gonna go.

But you have my number
if you need anything.

Oh, uh, wait.

Uh, does-does he come with an
instruction manual or something?

You'll be fine.
Bye, Louis.

Uh, okay, uh...

should we have tipped her?

You're asking me?

I don't even tip the pizza guy.

I don't like pizza.

I like Cheez-Its.

Oh, well, you know,
when you think about it,

a pizza is just
a really big Cheez-It

with sauce.

We're gonna get
Cheez-Its, right?

Berta?

I'm on it.

I'll be back as
soon as I can.

And, Louis?

That's the first time I ever

said that and meant it.

Hey, Louis?
Welcome to our house.

Do you want to come on in?

Oh, my God. Look at him.

He's adorable.

I know, I know.
He's like one of those TV kids.

Maybe we can put him
in commercials.

We know he likes Cheez-Its.

Alan, do you really want to be

making less money
than a six-year-old?

Oh, oh, oh. Oh.

Who is that?

This is Timothy.

He's a seal.

Oh! Well, hi, Timothy.

I'm Walden.

And I'm Alan.

Timothy doesn't talk.

Oh, right, yeah.

Because he's a seal.

No, because he's a toy.

Right. He-He's a toy.

Wow. Got a lot
of weekend left.

So, which one of you
is the mommy?

Um...
Um...

well, that's-that's
a great question.

And one I was hoping
you wouldn't ask

in the first five minutes.

You know, see, in some families,

there's a mommy and a daddy.

But in other families,
like this one,

there's, there's two daddies.

Why?

Wow, that is
another great question.

Um... Alan?

No, no. You're doing great.

Okay.

He's the mommy.

I told you, Timothy.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hey, Louis, check it out.

Casa de Louis.

Chez Louie.

San Louis... Obispo.

Basically what I'm saying is
this is your room.

Cool!

You know, I thought we could
decorate it together.

Lucky. He never let me.

Oh, and check this out.

This is your bed.

But if you're thinking about
jumping up and down on it,

you're gonna be
in a lot of trouble...

if you don't!

Uh, we also heard, uh,
that you like to draw.

So check out
this fully stocked art table.

You got, uh, markers,
crayons, paints.

Someone's gonna put
the âartyâ back in âparty.â

Okay, so, uh, why don't we,
uh, unpack your stuff?

We'll put it in the dresser,
and then we'll go do something.

No, I don't need to unpack.

Oh, okay.

Uh, well, then it's straight
to the good times, huh?

For King Louie
the Fun-teenth.

I apologize.

So, yeah,

what do you want to do?

You know, we could play a game,

we could go to the park,
we could go to the zoo,

we could go to SeaWorld
or Disneyland

or Legoland, or we could
play Legos in the house,

or we could play house,
or we could build a house,

or we could listen
to house music.

Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.

What's up, Miami!

Oontz. Oontz.

Or-or we don't have
to do any of that.

We could...

do something else, like...

Alan?

Uh, uh, we could,
we could go to the beach.

Oh, that's a great idea.

Oh, but where are we
gonna find one of those?

You live on the beach.

Oh! That's right!

It's your backyard.

So, what do you say?
You want to go?

Okay.

We got an okay. Okay.
So let's go.

Let's do this.
To the beach we go.

Oh, hey, uh,
if you need a bathing suit,

it's in the top drawer.

So why don't you change,

and we'll change,
and then we'll go

have a party on the beach.

Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.

Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz.

Oontz. Oontz.

Oh, my God,
that was like pulling teeth.

Please tell me
this gets easier.

It doesn't,

but the good news
is, you stop trying.

âª Men. âª

Hey, Louis,
look at this.

We're almost done.

Yes, now all we need

is a flag for the top.
Oh!

Oh, that's an old Band-Aid.

Uh, how about this?

We'll take this juice box,

flip it up here, and we'll put
the straw in like this,

and ta-da!

It's a flag!

Look at this, Louis!

All hail

the Kingdom
of Mount Berry Cooler!

Oh, oh,

and here comes the king, uh,
returning home from battle.

And what does
he have with him?

The spoils of war,

all the Cheez-Its in the land.

Isn't this cool, Louis?

I want to go back inside.

What?

It's kind of hot,

and I have to pee.

Well, uh, you know,

the ocean solves
both of those problems.

O-O-Okay.

Okay,
w-w-we'll meet you inside.

Hey, hey, Berta,
he's coming in!

I've got him!

Well, he hates me.

What?

We spent an hour

building a sand castle,

and all he did was dig a hole.

Who digs holes, Alan?

Prisoners, they want to escape.

Oh, Walden.

Why are the pretty ones
always so crazy?

Crazy? Am I?

Really? What about earlier
when he didn't want to unpack?

What was that all about?

Nobody likes to unpack.
I hate it.

Oh, is that why
you've never moved out?

Wow.

Um, misdirected anger,

your table is ready.

You know what,
he doesn't want to be here.

That's it.

I-I knew I couldn't do this.

Come on, Walden,
put yourself in his shoes.

He only spent
half a day with us.

He's gonna need more time
to feel safe here.

Yeah, right.

More time.

You think he'll love me
by tomorrow?

Trust me, Walden,

he'll warm up to you
just like I did.

Remember when you moved here?

I wasn't sure
I wanted you to stay.

I bought the house.

And I made it a home.

You're gonna have
to have more patience with him.

Fine.

Patience.

Where you going?
The ocean.

I'm hot and I got to pee.

Well, be careful.

He hates me.

Oh, there he is.

Did you put the seat down?

I never put it up.

Can I have a snack?

Do we have snacks?

Let's see.

Wow.

Take a load off.

When a guy named Charlie
lived here,

I had to keep this cabinet

stocked with coke...

...co powder.

Because he loved hot chocolate.

I like hot chocolate.

Not like he did.

You like your crackers?

Yeah.

You don't talk much, do you?

I get it.

I was a quiet child.

In fact,

you and I have a lot in common.

You like Cheez-Its, too?

I do.

But I was also raised

in a whole bunch
of foster homes.

You were?

Yep, and I hated it.

Moving around
all the time,

having to make friends
everywhere,

and no one ever offered me
grape juice.

Would you like to have
some grape juice?

Yes, please.

But I got to tell you,

we both hit the lottery
with this place.

Walden and Alan

are the best.

They're nice,

they're fun,

and guess what else.

What?

They're easy to fool.

Last year, I went to
my granddaughter's graduation

seven times.

And with that face...

...you can get anything
you want.

Welcome to Malibu, kid.

âª Men. âª

Can I come in?

What you drawing?

Oh.

A sand castle.

That's ironic.

Hey, uh, c-can we
talk for a second?

Sure.
All right.

Great.

Look, uh...

I know it's got
to be overwhelming being here

and being in new places
all the time

and with new people
and a new bed.

I mean, heck, for all you know,

there could be monsters
under the bed.

There's monsters?
No.

That's a bad example.

In fact, before you got here,

I de-monsterized
the entire house.

My point is, is...

I'm really glad
you're here, Louis.

I just want you
to be comfortable

with Alan and I.

So if, so if there's anything
you ever need to talk about,

like anything at all,
you can come to me.

So, that's all I have to say.

Is there anything
you would like to say?

Nope.

Really.

Just, like, just nothing?

Like, nothing at all?

Can I ask you a question?

Uh, yes, of course.

You can just, any time.

That-That's why I'm here.

So you just ask away.

Is it okay that I can draw
by myself for a little while?

Yeah.

Okay, yeah.

You-you want to be alone.

I get that.

That is not a problem.

So, you want your space,

and I shall give it to you.

I will withdraw while you draw.

Son of a bitch.

âª Men. âª

Walden?

Oh, God.

Oh, Louis.

Oh, hey.

What's going on, man?

It's really late.

I had a question, and you said
we could talk any time.

Well, that's-that's just

something that people say,

but, I, uh...

Yeah, what-what's up?

Am I gonna stay here with you?

What do you mean?

Sometimes I go to a house
for a weekend,

but then I don't stay.

Oh, buddy, that's what
you're worried about.

Well, come here,
c-come here, okay?

Jump up here.

Hey,

listen.

You can stay here as long
as you want to.

Do you want to?

Uh-huh. I really like it here.

That's... great.

Really surprising,
but it's great.

Hey,

I'm not going anywhere,

and as long as you want
to be here,

you're not going anywhere,
either.

And believe me, Alan is gonna be
here longer than the both of us.

So don't you worry.

Thanks.

So you really like it here, huh?

All right, what was
the best part of the day?

The Cheez-Its.

Yeah.

And I like Berta.

Berta's great,

and you like me, too, right?

Berta's so funny.

Patience, patience.

Listen,

as long as you're happy.

Cool.

It is cool, Louis.

It's very cool.

Where's Alan?

Look at us.

We're like
the Three Musketeers.

I don't think the
Three Musketeers

shared a bed.

You don't know that.

They were French.

Where's Berta?

No.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

And then you pull the bird back,
Uh-huh.

and then let them go fly
into the pig's house.

And then they roll around,
and then they explode.

And then it's fun.

Angry Birds sounds like
it's fun.

You know,
I bet the birds are so angry

'cause they don't get
enough sleep.

It's the pigs
who should be angry.

The birds are always crashing
into their house,

even when they build them
out of ice or in space.

I wonder if the pigs are
from Three Little Pigs.

That's messed up
because the wolf already broke

their old houses.

Little help, Alan?

âª Men. âª

Hey, Louis, check it out.

This app will help you learn
how to speak Mandarin Chinese.

Are you sending me to China?

No, I'd never do that.

He sent his kid to Japan.

Oh, no, no.

The-the Army sent him to Japan.

You're sending me to the Army?

No, no, n-no.

We're not sending you anywhere.

We-we just want
to help you learn.

So, check it out.

You can type in any phrase,

and the app will say it for you.

Ooh, what'd she say?

She sounds pretty.

She said,
"Alan, your fly is open."

Oh. Oh!

Uh, well, how do you
tell her, "Thank you"?

Uh, let's find out.

Xiexie.

That's gonna blow their minds
down at the Panda Express.

Extra orange chicken, xiexie.

Walden, I-I'm Chinese Elvis.

Xiexie. Xiexie, very much.

All right.

Let's put on these headphones,

and we'll learn
a little Chinese, huh?

So, um, listen,
g-going forward,

um, how are we gonna do
this whole co-parenting thing?

What do you mean?

Well, when you were gonna
adopt a baby,

we were gonna get
a divorce right after.

But now, if we become
Louis's foster parents,

we're gonna have to be together
for a minimum of six months.

Uh, not that I'm complaining.

This is the happiest
and most loving of any

of my three marriages.

I'm thinking it would
just be the opposite

of when Jake was here.

You were the dad, and
I occasionally imparted wisdom,

like... the skull
and crossbones on a bottle

underneath the sink doesn't mean
that it's pirate juice.

Okay, well, uh, uh,

then I will follow
your lead with Louis.

I will be the second
in command, the-the copilot,

the, uh, the, uh,
the lieutenant, if you will.

I won't.

This is hard.

Oh, all right,
let me help you out here.

Type in a phrase.

Anything you want to say.

Okay.

"I... want to quit."

Okay, uh...

Uh, excuse me.

If you're trying to say,
"I want to quit,"

it's pronounced...

What you asked for is
a lap dance.

Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

It's okay, I wasn't offended.

Oh, well, in that case...

I'm Jean.

I'm Walden.

Oh, and, uh, this is
Louis and Alan.

Hi.
Nice to meet you.

So, you're teaching Louis
Mandarin?

Well, I bought him, uh,
an app for 99 cents,

so, yeah, I'm teaching him.

Well, I speak fluent Mandarin,
so if you need any help

with anything...

give me a call.

Ah, well, I could always use
a helping hand.

Oh. Oh!

Nice meeting you.

What happened?

What did you say?

He said,
"They're married."

And if he hadn't,
I was about to.

How's it going
out there?

I don't know. I'm trying
to read their lips.

He either said, "I
really like it here,"

or "I'd really
like a beer."

I-I'm sure
he's saying good things.

You know, how-how you're
teaching him Chinese,

how I'm teaching him
environmental awareness.

You taught him to pee in
the shower to save water.

And you know what
our Mother Earth says to that?

Xiexie.

I got to tell you, I've already
grown attached to this kid.

And if she does try
to take him away,

I know a guy
who can get him back.

You're kidding, right?

Right, kidding.

But if I find an envelope in my
car with, say, two grand in it,

I have no way of knowing
where it came from.

Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

Uh, yeah, sure.

Uh, Berta, could
you watch Louis?

Absolutely.

We'll be in the car
with the engine running.

No reason.

So, I talked to Louis
about his weekend here.

Uh, did he answer you
in English or Mandarin?

English.

Though I'm very impressed
you're teaching him Chinese.

And to pee in the shower.

That's mine.

I'm also teaching him to dance
like no one is watching.

Well, he seems to have
settled in nicely.

He feels very happy
and safe with you guys,

so I see no reason
why I shouldn't approve you

to be Louis's foster parents.

Really?
Are you serious?

I rarely lie about these things.

I did it once,
and it did not go well.

This-this is great!

I-I know. I-I've never been
approved for anything, ever.

Bite me, Discover Card.

Congratulations!
Thank you!

This is my favorite part
of the job.

Well, that and doughnut Friday.

Oh, God, my life is empty.

Oh, wait, d-does
Louis know?

No, he thinks I'm happy.

Oh, you mean about him here.

Uh, no, you should tell him.

But before you do,
just remember,

kids who've been in the foster
system as long as he has can be

a little withdrawn
or manipulative,

so don't be surprised
if he acts out.

It's okay. I was a
rebel when I was a kid.

One night, I took my
mom's car for a joyride.

The cops would
have never caught me

if the library
hadn't been closed.

Well, call me if
you need anything.

I got to run. I got to
hit the craft store.

I am making each one of my cats
a Christmas stocking.

I should have stopped at
"I got to run."

Anyway, congratulations.

Oh, hey, uh, Louis,
could you come in here?

Oh, my God, we should
tell him he can't stay.

How funny would that be?

I'll follow your lead.

Hey, Louis, um,

so Ms. McMartin said

that you like it here
and you want to stay.

I do.

Well, we told her

that we want you to stay,

and she said... okay!

Really? Cool!

Yeah. We should celebrate.

Can we get pizza, Zippy?

That turned out funnier
than I thought it would.

âª Men. âª

You know, when my
son was your age,

we used to play video
games just like this.

Really?
Yes, and I used to let him win,

just like I'm
letting you win...

Hey!

How'd you blow
up my car?!

All right, Louis,
time to get ready for bed.

Five more minutes?

No. You know the deal.

One hour of video games a
night. Now it's bedtime.

Aw, no fair.

Well, life isn't fair.

Look at my face, look at his.

All right, I'm gonna go
run you a bath.

Put your dishes in the sink
and put away the controllers.

And, Louis, you help him.

Oh, I know you're upset,
but rules are important.

It's just, we never got to play
video games in the group home.

Oh, of course.

The group home.

Okay, what if we just
snuck in a few more minutes?

Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, uh...

but you can't
tell Walden,

and we have to play
it really quietly.

You're the coolest.

I'm the cool dad.

I'm the cool dad.

âª Men. âª

Oh, hey
there, kiddo.

How'd you sleep?

With my eyes closed.

Ah, kicking it old school.

I respect that.

Can I have breakfast?

Sure. How about some oatmeal?

Cookies!

Well, do you like oatmeal cookies?
Yes.

Well, this is a
sugarless oatmeal cookie

in wet, pasty form.

Why can't I have cookies?

Well, because
cookies aren't breakfast food.

And remember what Walden said
about eating healthy.

Yeah, I know.

My last foster family
wouldn't give me cookies either.

Oh.

I suppose one wouldn't hurt.

Thanks.

Hey, Louis, are you up yet?

Oh. Uh, in here!

Eat it. Wipe your mouth.

Chocolate lips sink ships.

Morning.

Morning. Just making Louis
some oatmeal.

That's good, 'cause we got
a big day for you, big guy.

I got a bunch
of errands to run,

but Alan is gonna take you
to the store

and buy you a new backpack.

I saw one that looks
just like Yoda.

To school you will wear it.

Okay.
Hmm.

What are you eating?

Show it to me.

Is that a cookie?

Where did you get a cookie?

Louis, where did you get
a cookie?

Hey, uh, Louis,
why don't you go get dressed

and-and I'll make you
some oatmeal,

and then you can get going.

Okay.

Oh, and-and
don't forget

to brush your teeth.

And-and wash your hands.

Oh, and put on clean underwear.

Clean underwear?

We're going to Target,
not the White House.

Why would you give him a cookie
for breakfast?

I couldn't help it.
He gave me orphan face.

Please, sir,
can I have a cookie?

Me tum-tum is all empty
and growly.

When it comes to Louis,
we have to be a team.

If I make a rule,
you got to have my back.

You're right, you're right,
and-and from now on,

I will ignore him
like I ignore all those calls

from the collection agency.

Great. Okay, now, please,

today, just take him
to the store,

get him a backpack,
and then bring him home.

I want to do
something fun later.

A hint: has to do
with miniature golf

and it rhymes with "what-what."

That sounds great.

I'll, uh, take him out
right after breakfast.

And while you're out,
get some more of these cookies.

They make me
tum-tum all smiley, governor.

See, I can do accents.

âª Men. âª

Okay. Okay, here's the
fun part. Wait. Wait.

âª Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto âª

âª Domo âª
âª Domo âª

âª Domo âª
âª Domo âª

âª Domo arigato,
Mr. Roboto âª

âª Domo âª
âª Domo âª

âª Domo. âª
âª Domo. âª

I like that song.
It's about robots.

Yup. If you have to have one
cassette stuck in your dash,

make it Styx.

Look, laser tag! Can we go?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

We're just gonna go buy
a backpack and go straight home.

Please?

Oh, no, do not
give me that face.

It is not gonna work.

I thought you were cool.

Well... I suppose one game
of laser tag couldn't hurt.

Awesome!

But it has to be a...

âª Secret, secret âª

âª I got a secret... âª

âª Men. âª

Go tell your mommies
you got shot by CoolDad47.

Hey, hey, who hit me?

I got you.
Oh. I'm gonna get you.

I'm gonna get you.

Yeah, yeah, you better run.

Better run faster.

Ow, my head!

Louis?

Louis, are you okay?

Hey, whoa, whoa!

Wait, wait, don't shoot!
Uh, my kid is hurt.

Ha, ha. Sucker.

âª Men. âª

âª  Men. âª

Hey. I got here
as quick as I could.

Are you okay, buddy?
What happened?

He's fine. It's typical
kid stuff, you know?

He was running
a little too fast,

and he tripped
and bumped his head.

And then Alan
shot a little girl.

What?
We played laser tag.

âª Secret, secret âª

âª It was a secret. âª

Alan, can I talk to you
in the hallway?

Ooh, you're in trouble.

I really hope you have
a good explanation

for taking him to laser tag.

Uh, okay, j-just
out of curiosity,

um, uh, what, in your opinion,

would qualify
as a good explanation?

I don't know.
Y-Your car broke down

outside of the place.

And then the tornado was coming,
so you took shelter inside.

And then once you got in there,
you contracted a rare disease

that could only be cured
by playing laser tag.

Wow, it's like you were there.

What the hell, man?

You said you had my back.

Why do you keep doing this?

He thinks I'm cool.

I mean, when Jake was a kid,

he thought Charlie
was the cool one.

When you moved in, Jake
thought you were the cool one.

Now it's my turn.

Louis thinks I'm Al-Al Cool Dad.

No, he doesn't.

He's using this

to manipulate you just like
Ms. McMartin said he would.

Oh, so the-the only possible
reason that someone

would like me is because
they're trying to manipulate me?

Yes, that's right!

You're not Al-Al Cool Dad,
you're just Weird Al.

Okay, first of all,

that's a compliment
to a lover of puns.

Secondly,
you're overreacting.

Overreacting?

I asked you
to get Louis a backpack.

Instead you got him stitches!

Uh, actually,
it's a liquid band.

Shut up!

Louis is fine.

Kids get hurt all the time,
especially boys.

Jake was constantly banging his head.
Okay,

I really don't think you should
be using Jake as an example.

Oh, so what are you saying? That
I did a bad job raising my son?

Jake is great, but he did just
send you a photo from Tokyo

and said-- and I quote-- "Look
at what a great job they did

rebuilding the city
after Godzilla."

Okay, I may not be
the best parent in the world,

but at least I found a woman
willing to have a kid with me.

Okay, you know what,
we should drop this.

Like you did Jake,
on his head, repeatedly.

Yeah. I don't have to take this.

So I am just gonna walk away.

Like every woman
you've ever dated.

Oh, no, you're
gonna walk away?

Well, when am I
gonna see you again?

Oh, I know. In 20 minutes,

at my house,
where you live rent-free.

Proctology is on
the eighth floor, Walden!

In case you'd like
to get that stick removed.

Al-Al Cool Dad, out.

âª Men. âª

Morning.

Morning.

I want you to know
I spent a lot of time thinking

about everything last night.

And?

And I think
an apology is sufficient.

I don't need a gift.

Although I certainly
wouldn't refuse

a new panini press.

That's a great idea.

You know, if I bought you
a panini press,

would you smash your balls
between the hot metal grates?

Oh, okay.

I see I'm the only one
capable of being a mature adult,

so to you I say...

You spit on me.

Oh, did I?

Okay.

Let's go.

Can I play, too?

Hey, buddy, uh, you're already
finished with your chores?

Yup, I made my bed.

What a responsible
young man.

I asked you to do
something and you did it.

And he's six.

Hey, uh, buddy, now that you're
finished with your chores,

what do you say
we go bowling, huh?

Doesn't that sound fun?

We get to wear
other people's shoes.

Can Alan come?

Oh...

Alan already wears
other people's shoes.

I actually have to go
to the grocery store, anyway.

Do you know what else
would be fun?

Hey, anything you want to do.

Let's go to the grocery
store with Alan.

âª Men. âª

Can I get Pop Tarts?

Ah, Pop Tarts.

This is a wonderful
choice.

Might I suggest
the classic strawberry?

Is best by 2016.

This is an excellent year.

Anything for the lady?

Perhaps a glass
of kiss my shir-ass.

Oh, oh.

What do you got there, buddy?

I want Froot Loops.

You know, we only get
one special treat.

So if you want those, we
got to put the Pop Tarts back.

But I want both.

Well, here's the thing:
we can't have both.

So... that's the rule.

Ooh, this should be good.

Okay, Louis...

you heard what I said.

You can't have these.

Oh, Snap...

Crackle and Pop.

What are you doing?

I want Froot Loops.

Okay, I'm gonna count to three,

and if you don't get up,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

Ooh, counting. This is some
groundbreaking stuff.

One...

...two...

...three.

One...

One and a half...

Well, you clearly
have this under control.

I'm gonna go check out the
cuties in the produce section.

And I may or may not
be talking about the tangerines.

You hear that, Louis?
He's leaving.

And I, now, I guess,

now I'm leaving, so...

unless you want to live
here in the cereal aisle,

I suggest you get up.

All right, okay.
Here we go, then.

Have fun.

I hope Captain Crunch
can put you through college.

Next stop
is the checkout aisle.

That's it.

I am not kidding,
I mean it. I am leaving.

Attention shoppers,

we are having
a two-for-one sale

on meaningless threats
in aisle five.

Can you help me out here?
Help? Oh, oh.

You want me to help?

Well, I suppose I could
drop him on his head repeatedly.

Okay, you know what,
I deserve that.

Yesterday I said some
things that I regret.

Mm. Like what?

God, do we have
to do this now?

Why not? I'm not going anywhere.

Clearly, he's not
going anywhere.

Okay, fine, I said that-that
you're not a very good father.

And that is
simply not true.

Thank you.

That must have been
hard for you to say.

And Jake is a very bright
and capable young man.

And that must have been
damn near impossible to say.

But... very sweet.

Um, I shouldn't have gone
behind your back with Louis.

But it just, it felt so good
that he wanted to be with me.

And I've never been
anybody's first pick before.

You were my first pick
to help me raise a kid.

Clean up on aisle five.

The floor's about to be
covered in tears.

Okay. Can-Can you
give me a hand here?

Okay, I've seen this
a million times before.

There is one surefire parental
technique that always works.

He wanted Froot Loops.

We're good parents.
We really are.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª
Louis is all tucked in.

Oh, yeah?

No extra
bedtime story?

No secret dessert?

No dancing like
no one's watching?

No jazz hands were raised,
no heels were kicked.

I appreciate that.
I got your back.

And to say thank you,

I got you a
special surprise.

Froot Loops!

Shh.
âª Secret, secret âª

âª We got a secret. âª

.......... ********** ..........

Ugh.

How is it possible

that kids weigh twice as
much when they're asleep?

I know.

And he should weigh less
after his little mishap

on the spinning teacups.

Yeah.

Felt bad for that girl
in the Cinderella costume

in the cup behind us.

She was right in
the splash zone.

I'm exhausted.

Me, too.

I'm also sticky and dirty
and sweaty and slimy.

I'm like the seven dwarfs
of disgusting.

Ugh, I should not have eaten
that funnel cake.

Well, I see
your funnel cake

and raise you a deep-fried
Snickers stuffed into a Twinkie.

I think I blacked out briefly.

Is being a dad always
this tiring?

These are the best
moments of your life.

And they are over
so fast.

Seems like only yesterday,

Jake was holding my hand
in the haunted house.

Now he's half a world away
in the army,

wondering if a "dishonorable
discharge" is something you get

from a dirty geisha.

So sweet.

Walden?

What?

What do you want?

Are you asleep?

3Ks.

That's what people do at...

5:30 in the morning.

Is it okay
if I can make breakfast?

Sure.

Thanks.

Walden?

Walden's not here,
please leave a message.

How do you like your pancakes?

Quietly.

In three hours.

With blueberries.

Okay, I'll go make them.

Oh, God.

Flames.

âª Men. âª

Walden?

Ready or not, here I come.

What?

Louis and I,
we're playing hide and seek.

He's under his bed, hiding

and I'm in the kitchen,
seeking sleep.

I hear ya.

I barely got my eight hours.

I don't know
if I can handle this.

Little boys have
a lot of energy.

They're like cute
little crackheads.

Except crackheads have
better toilet aim.

No, no, this isn't about
being tired.

I just, I don't know
if I'm cut out to be a dad.

Hey, I didn't think I could live

in a Malibu beach house
for free,

but I figured it out.

Well, I don't know
if I can figure this out.

I mean, Th-this kid
has bounced around

the foster care system
his whole life.

I mean, I-I don't know
what he needs.

I mean, does he need structure?

Does he need freedom?

Does he need medication?

I should have asked that
before they dropped him off.

All he needs is
your love and support.

That's a bunch of crap.

Walden, every parent goes
through this.

B-But you're actually
doing a great job.

You're just overwhelmed
because this is all so new,

a-and you're trying to be
everything to him all the time.

You know, full-time dad,
full-time playmate.

You have to give
yourself a break.

How?

He's 24-7.

He's like the Energizer bunny.

You know why you never met
the Energizer bunny's dad?

'Cause one night,
he went out for cigarettes,

and he just kept going
and going and going.

One thing that'll help
is getting Louis some friends.

Playdates.

They chase each other
around for hours,

eventually they pass out
like work dogs.

Kid'll be in
bed by 8:00,

then it's you, me,
a bowl of popcorn

and binge-watching
The Good Wife.

Okay, so what?

So, I just...
I'll just Google a place

to meet a fun
cute six-year-old.

Oh, yeah. No.

I heard it when I said it.

âª Men. âª

Uh, this place
is awesome.

They have a rock wall.

Will you climb it with me?

Oh, buddy, you know, the whole
idea is for you to come here

and meet all these
other kids.

No, just you and me.

Please?

Oh.

All right,
I mean, come on.

How do you say no to those eyes?

I hear ya.

Oh, uh, hey, can I have
some money for the snack bar?

Please?
No.

It's not my fault you already
spent all your allowance.

Room for one more?

Absolutely.

Care for a juice box?

We have cherry, grape
and Chardonnay.

Well, what else can I say
except, "chardonn-yay."

Uh, I am Alan.

Uh, that's Louis over there,
he's mine.

I'm Danielle, and that's
my daughter in the water wings.

Oh, is there a pool here?
No.

At some point,
you just pick your battles.

I'm Laurel, this is Julie.

Oh, hot dad on the rock wall.

I claim this
as Mount Louis!

Wow, he's really cute.

Big time.

Sorry, ladies.

He's taken.

No kidding?

Good for you.

How'd you snag him?

I met him at a low point in his
life, and I took care of him.

And he's been taking care
of me every day since.

That's the kind of man I need.

No, that's the kind
of man I need.

You're married.

Yeah, to Roger.

He hasn't screwed me
since the prenup.

Classic Julie.

Oh, this is so Sex and the City
right now.

Alan, do we
have any wipes?

The kid above me dripped
something on my face.

The best-case scenario is snot.

Here, I've got some.

Oh, thank you.

Walden, this is, uh,
Laurel, Danielle and Julie.

The ladies, the gals.

The juice box heroes.

Hi.

Hello.

Hi, nice to meet you all.

Your son is adorable.

I'm his husband, silly.

So, uh, which one's yours?

My daughter, Lily,

is the one licking
that little boy.

Sweetie, we don't
lick strangers!

Oh, and I thought
we were gonna be friends.

All right.

I'm headed to the ball pit.

Same thing he said as he dove
under the covers last night.

Boing.

âª Men. âª

Thanks for having us.

I got to say, this is a
great spot for a playdate.

This view is amazing.

Yes. Yes, it is.

You know, I used to walk
by houses like this

and think the people
on the decks were just looking

down their noses at everyone,
feeling all superior.

Now I know it's true.

Roger sold our beach house

'cause he said we never used it.

Using that logic,
we should sell his penis.

Classic Julie.

Hey, w-we should make
this a regular thing.

Oh. Yeah, next time we'll
do it at one of your houses.

Hey, uh, Louis, is
everything okay?

Over.

Lego tower fell over.

Uh, you didn't
say "over."

Over.

I said the Lego tower fell over.

Over.

You're so good
with him. Over.

Actually, I-I feel like I
have no idea what I'm doing.

Join the club.

Parenting's
like a yoga class.

You just do what
everybody else is doing

and try not to laugh
when someone farts.

Okay, so all the kids are
playing in Louis' room.

Well, technically, three
of them are playing together,

and Louis is in the corner,
coloring by himself.

That's perfectly normal.

The parenting books call it
"parallel play."

Oh, that's good
to know.

So, in high school,
I wasn't such a weirdo.

I was just a parallel player.

My sex life with my first wife
was a lot of parallel play.

Just give Louis time.

Remember, this is
all new for him.

Kind of like
learning on my honeymoon

that I wasn't going to have sex
was all new for me.

You know, I just want him
to have friends.

You know, like a couple girls,
and a couple boys.

He's gonna be fine.

In the meantime,
I have made some friends

who have welcomed me
into the secret world of women.

I am this close to discovering
everything about them.

What they like, what
they don't like.

And where they don't like it.

We're supposed to be here
helping Louis make friends.

Oh, please, I see
how you look at Laurel.

It's the same way I look at
a five dollar bill in a tip jar

I think I can swap out
for a single.

Okay, what are you
talking about?

That is Louis'
friend's mom.

And, yes,
we get along great.

And, yes,
she's pretty and nice.

And, yes, she used to be
a gymnast and can still

put her legs
behind her head.

And she is out there.

So why am I still standing here,
talking to you?

I can put my legs behind my
head, but you'll never see it.

âª Men. âª

He was a really nice guy,
Mm-hmm.

and I liked hanging
out with him,

but when we got
to the bedroom,

he was just, well...

If he were a candy bar,
he'd be the fun size.

There's nothing fun
about that.

Yeah, nothing worse
than a small penis.

But, seriously, how
small is too small?

Alan, you are a riot.

We should hang out
with you more often.

Hey, what do you
say, we all go out

this Saturday for
a girls night?

You know, get a limo,
go out dancing,

wear our sluttiest outfits.

Julie, you can wear what
you're wearing now.

Uh, I'm bad.

Should we go check
on the kids?

Are you kidding?

They're set up with pizza,
popsicles and The Lego Movie.

For the next two hours,

âª Everything is awesome. âª

Yeah, I've seen that
movie, like, five times.

I should really watch it
with Louis at some point.

I haven't seen a movie

that wasn't for a kid
in forever.

The other night
I actually had a sex dream

about an animated character.

Whoa...

Prince Charming?

The old guy from Up.

And, sadly, it was the only sex
I've had in two years.

Well, if it meant a
whole night's sleep,

I'd have sex with an
animated Ed Asner, too.

You think you're tired now.

You missed the hardest years.

The-the... the picky eating,
the tantrums, the bed-wetting.

Okay, to be fair, I get
all of that with Alan.

You guys are a great team.
Hmm.

The only thing
my ex would help with

was driving the babysitter home.

She'd have the kids
in bed by 8:00

and my husband in bed by 10:00.

Oh... that's horrible.

Is she a good sitter?
'Cause we're looking.

Sorry.

Without that jerk of an ex,

I wouldn't have Lily,

and even at six years old,
she's my best friend.

I hope I get there
with Louis at some point.

You'll get there.

I hope I stay there with Lily.

I'm afraid that by the time
she's a teenager,

she'll be like,
"Mom, you're 100!

Nobody believes
I'm your sister!"

Okay, how could anyone say that

about someone as pretty,
smart and flexible as you?

You're so sweet.

You don't happen to know

of a single, straight version
of you, do you?

I used to know one.

Are you looking for a date?

I told you,
it's been over two years.

I need a lot more than a date.

âª Popsicles are awesome! âª

Okay, I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

I'm gonna wait
here for a bit.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Hope you are ready to go.

The ladies just Instagrammed

a selfie
from the limo.

#GirlsNightOut
is on like Chaka Khan!

All right, Louis
is eating his dinner.

Oh, great. Chaka Khan!

Hey, thank you again
for watching him tonight.

And if anything
comes up--

and I mean anything at all--
you call my cell.

Got it.

Oh, if he wants to play a game,

he likes Chutes and Ladders.

And if he want
to watch a cartoon,

he likes Phineas and Ferb.

And who does he like in the
Cardinals-Rams game tonight?

I know I'm being
a little bit crazy,

but this is the first time
I've left him alone.

Relax, I had five kids,

12 grandkids and
four great-grandkids.

I've done it all.

Except teach them
about birth control.

I don't feel good.

Oh, no.
What's the matter?

I just threw up.

Oh, no.
Oh... yep.

He's got a fever.

I'll bet it was that snot-nosed kid
on the rock wall.

Typhoid Tyler.
Yeah.

I got this.

I worked for Charlie
for ten years.

I know vomit.

Cleaning it up
and inducing it.

I never threw up
SpaghettiOs before.

It's kind of fun.
Oh...

Should we go
to the doctor?

Oh, no, no.

I'm sure it's
just a tummy ache.

I'll text the girls and let 'em know
we can't make it.

Oh, no. Come on.
You go.

You sure?

Yeah, come on, this is
what a parent does.

This is what I
signed up for.

Besides, you took
a half an hour

getting into
those Spanx.

All right. Sorry.

Um... I'll send
pictures.

Danielle said that
if I get her drunk enough

she'll show me her tattoos.

Uh, she's got a bird on her hand
and two in her...

âª Men. âª

Walden...

I'm sorry I got sick.

What? Come on, man.

Don't be sorry.

It happens.

I'm sorry you don't feel well.

But you were going
to go out with Alan

and now you can't 'cause of me.

Oh, I'm not missing anything.

You ever seen Alan dance?

All right.

Now, you get some good sleep

and I'm gonna be right here

if you need anything.

Oh, and you know
who else'll be here?

Your new friend,
"Barfy the Bucket."

âª I'm here for you âª

âª If you're ready to spew! âª

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Laurel.

What are you
doing here?

I bailed.

Didn't Alan tell you?

No, the only
thing I got

was a picture of
Alan twerking.

With a caption that said,
"Alan got his groove back."

Well, when I heard
that Louis was sick,

I thought you could
use some help.

And soup.

Come on, that
is so sweet.

You did not
have to do this.

You look amazing.
Oh, thanks.

Well, I already had
the sitter, and...

first rule of parenting:
Never cancel the sitter.

Well, unless she's banging
your husband.

Too far?

No, uh, "too far"

was starting a Facebook page

called "Tiffany Jones is a
Husband-Stealing Little Bitch."

Uh, do you know what Louis has?

Uh, well, I went on the Internet

and I've narrowed it down
to either the flu,

rickets
or early-onset menopause.

Second rule of parenting:

Never consult the Internet.

How's he doing now?

Well, he's asleep

and he's doing
pretty well.

Oh, good, because...

I brought this for us.

Oh...

You know,
third rule of parenting:

Kids aren't the only ones
that can drink from a bottle.

âª Men. âª

âª Oh, yes, it's ladies' night âª

âª And the feeling's right âª

âª Oh, yes, it's ladies' night,
oh, what a night âª

âª Oh, what a night. âª

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy, there.

I pour strong when
the alcohol's free.

I have to cram a lot of fun

- into a short amount of time.
- Mmm.

Kind of like sex with Roger.

What is it with guys

and their constant need for sex?

Look at Alan here.
He's out with two women,

but I bet even he
wants sex right now.

I do. I really do.

Oh, my God!
Let's dance!

Come up here, Alan!

No, I-I'm good down here.

Well, he's still asleep

and he feels cooler,

but now I'm worried that
he might have hypothermia.

Yeah.

You know, one of
the hardest lessons

I've had to learn as a parent
is sometimes

you just
gotta relax.

Relax?

All I do is worry.

And now that
I don't sleep,

I have plenty
of time to do it.

Is he exercising enough?

Is he eating right?
Does he even want to stay here?

I mean, this is the most
terrifying thing I've ever done.

And-- this is scarier than
when I bought the big iPhone

and I didn't know
if it would fit in my pocket.

You think
you're scared?

I have a daughter.

I worry about
all the same things you do,

plus penises.

And with you,

you have to worry
about animated penises.

I should have never
told you that.

You should never
tell anyone that.

All right, all right.
What-what's your next date?

Shrek?

No, no, no.
The-the genie from Aladdin.

Or-or maybe you'll
have a three-way

with the Hakuna Matata guys?

Shut up.

Make me.

I could make you.

Oh, yeah?

Mm-hmm.

I'm right here.

I'm so sorry.
What? Why?

You're married.

To a man.
Oh...

That. Uh...

I should go.

No, no, no, no. No, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

Here's... okay, the thing
about my marriage is...

I'm not gay.

Does Alan know?

His brain knows,

but his heart may not.

Here-here-here,
here's the thing.

Here's the thing:
Alan is...

he's my best
friend, okay?

And-and he married me
as a favor

so it would be easier
to adopt Louis.

Okay? And-and...

Well, I mean...
the fact that you

married your
best friend

so that you could
adopt Louis is..

actually
very sweet.

So...

...you're not
mad at me?

Hakuna matata.

That's my philosophy.

So...

...can we kiss again?
Yeah.

It's been so long since
I've kissed a man.

Oh...

I wish I could say
the same thing.

Julie, your boobs look
great in that blouse.

I am so jealous.

Thanks to my kids,

mine went from 34B
to 34 "used to be."

I like your boobs.

I don't know.

What do you think, Alan,

should I get 'em done?

Oh, well, I'm no expert.

I-I think they're lovely.

Are you sure?

Oh, my!

You just did that.

Um, you guys, I-I think there's
something I should tell you...

He has nothing
to compare them with.

Here.

You guys are my best friends.

Aw!
Aw!

Okay, okay.

I-I know you haven't
done this in a while,

so I don't want
to go too fast,

but do you want
to go up to my...

Let's go.

Oh.

Walden?

Can you come here?

He didn't say "over,"
so it doesn't count.

Oh, go check on him.

It's fine.

I've waited for two years,
I can wait a little bit longer.

Thank you.

Oh. Don't start without me.

Or do.

Oh, uh, by the way,
if you want to stay in the mood,

we get all the cartoon channels.

âª Men. âª

Walden?

Parenting rule number four:

Sleep is better than sex.

âª Men. âª

This is the best night
of my life.

I love you girls.

We should get matching tattoos.

I have a better idea.

Let's go to a strip club!

That is better!

âª Oh, yes,
it's ladies' night... âª

This was a great idea.

That is definitely
bigger than fun size.

Make it rain!

Yeah, give him
some money!

Oh, this just keeps
getting better.

âª Men. âª

Okay.

Hold up your gifts.

Everybody has to see the gold
and frankincense and myrrh

so they know
we're the three wise men.

It's 88 degrees out.

I don't have any myrrh.

Unless it's the biblical term
for âswamp ass.â

We want this
to be mantel-worthy.

We want people to say, you know,
âLook at those costumes,

âlook at that view,
look at Cher's house

perfectly positioned
over Alan's right shoulder.â

Oh, it's got to be
better than last year.

Me as Joseph,
Berta as the Virgin Mary

looking down at you in a diaper.

People loved that.

Okay, here we go.

Now everybody say...

Sweet baby Jesus!

Sweet baby Jesus!

Sorry about that.

Oh, that's so cute.

You guys are dressed
as Duck Dynasty.

No. We're the three kings
of Bethlehem.

Oh, right.

I don't get HBO.

Guys, look at him.

Isn't he the cutest
in his little robe and beard?

You want my gold?

Oh!

First cute girl he meets, he's
already giving away his money.

You know, I think I have a

âª Men. âª

I found
the fake snow!

Oh.

It looks real.

Yeah. I love a white Christmas.

So did Charlie.

He used to put snow
on every mirror in the house.

Okay.

Hey, hey, buddy, why
don't you go inside

and write your letter to Santa?

Santa's not real.

What?

Of course he is.

He's never brought me
anything I asked for.

Hey, I am sure

that Santa's gonna come through
for you this year, buddy.

That's what grown-ups
always say.

Come inside with me.

I made gingerbread Zippys.

I was gonna make
gingerbread houses,

but everybody knows
Zippys don't have houses.

A six-year-old boy
who doesn't believe in Santa.

How sad is that?

Almost as sad as my
20-year-old boy who does.

This sucks.

Just 'cause he grew up
in a group home doesn't mean

that he can't enjoy
the magic of Christmas.

I know. It was always
Jake's favorite holiday.

Especially the year he turned 13

and got his first
Christmas boner.

It was the only toy
he played with all day.

Hey, you know,
I bet Louis would believe

if we got him
exactly what he wanted.

I don't know what he wants.

He wants a bike.

God! Rose.

What are you
doing here?

Wait. How do you know
about Louis?

Oh, Walden, you're so adorable.

I just wanted to bring by
my homemade Christmas candies.

Do you like nuts?

Covered in chocolate, yes.

With a sweater and skirt, no.

Oh. Okay.

On this day, Walden's heart
shrank three sizes.

Anyway,

I know this time of year
can get busy,

so if you need a helping hand,
I'm here.

I can wrap presents or babysit
or read a Christmas story.

I'm great at doing voices.

Or hearing them.

What do you want, Rose?

My DNA, my fingerprints,
a lock of my hair?

No, silly.

I have all that.

I want to be your friend again.

I don't think
that I'm comfortable

with you being around Louis.

Or me.

If you want to hang out
with Alan, that's fine.

I'll pass.

âª Men. âª

Here you go-- a little
Christmas cheer for everyone.

Ugh! What is this?

It's eggnog.

With no rum!

Eggnog without booze
is as boring and bland

as church without booze.

Be a dear and go get some
rum for your grandmother.

Evelyn, he's six years old.

Oh. Yes, right.

The rum is in a bottle
with a pirate on it.

Maybe-maybe we can wait
until Louis goes to bed.

Of course.

So run along to bed, dear.

Mom.

If you don't go to sleep,
Santa won't come.

There is no Santa.

What?! Of course there is.

Santa's as real
as the nose on my face.

Well, he's as real as my...

Trust me, he's real.

You know, she's right, and
tonight we're gonna prove it,

because we got
a Santa cam,

so we can catch
the big man in red on video.

Santa Claus!

Old Saint Nick!

Papa Noel.

Babbo Natale.

Weihnachtsmann.

Which, of course,
means âChristmas manâ in German.

Teachable moment.

The-the point is,
in the morning,

when you see
him on video,

then you'll believe
he's real, right?

I guess.

I guess?! What?

It's a Christmas miracle!

Did you hear that, Alan?
Did you hear that, Evelyn?

You hear that, Clarence?

Merry Christmas, you wonderful
old building and loan!

Okay, off to bed you go.

And soon, you'll have
visions of sugar plums

dancing in your head.

Can I have some pirate rum?

No, we don't want visions

of pink elephants
dancing in our head.

Okay, you go brush your teeth,
and I'll be in in a minute.

When Alan was little
and couldn't sleep,

I used to give him whiskey.

Breast-feeding
doesn't count, Mother.

So here's the plan.

Santa's not actually coming.

You don't say.

But how awesome is this?

We got the number two guy from
the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

So, if the giant

Bullwinkle balloon breaks loose
and kills the number one Santa,

this is the guy.

Yeah.

He also appeared as Santa

on an episode of
Walker, Texas Ranger.

He and Chuck Norris fought the
bad guys with Christmas fu.

So, when he gets here,
he's gonna take the presents

that we bought for him, and he's
gonna put them under the tree,

and then we'll get it on video,

and then Louis will have the
perfect Charlie Brown Christmas.

âª Lou, Lou, Lou âª

âª Lou-Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou âª

âª Lou, Lou, Lou âª

âª Lou-Lou, Lou, Lou âª

âª Lou, Lou, Lou,
Lou-Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou... âª

I need rum.

âª Lou, Lou, Lou âª

âª Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou... âª

âª Men. âª

Santa's here!

I give you
Kris Kringle.

Are you smoking pot?

Of course not.

Don't worry.

Santa's got a prescription card.

Well, apparently, the presents

have already been
delivered in Colorado.

Here. Come on in.

I'm Walden.
This is Alan and, uh, Evelyn.

Uh, wh-what do you go by?
Mr. Claus?

Babbo Natale?

Weihnachtsmann?

Actually, it's Frank.

It's not very Christmasy.

Well, if you don't like it,

I can hang some mistletoe
over my ass.

That's my son
you're talking to.

Good one.

I-I... I'm sorry.
We're-we're just really excited.

It's our first Christmas
with our foster son.

Uh, basically,
what we're gonna do is

film you putting the presents
under the tree.

Uh, and then I've written
a little something

for you to say to Louis.

Let me guess.

âHo, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, Louis!â

Oh, that's better.

Go with that.

Okay, okay, okay,
and then...

then you'll take a
bite of the cookie,

you'll crunch the carrot,
you'll sip the milk,

wink at the camera, jiggle
your belly and leave.

So it's toys,
bite, crunch,

sip, wink,
jiggle, leave.

Toys, bite, crunch, sip,
wink, jiggle, leave.

Got it?

So you want me to be Santa.

Toys, bite, crunch, sip,
wink, jiggle, leave.

That sounds a lot like an orgy
I had in Palm Springs once.

âª Men. âª

All right,
let's get this stuff wrapped

so we can enjoy this holiday
the way I always imagined.

Listening to Michael BublÃ©'s
Christmas album...

with my husband.

Aw, looks like Alan's getting
his first gift early.

Where's the boy's bike?

Oh, right here.

That's not a boy's bike.
That's a box.

The boy's bike's in the box.

Tell me the boy's bike
in the box has been built.

Oh, no, they wanted $75
to assemble it.

That's like ten pairs of pants.

I was paying for it!

Oh, come on.

How hard could it be?

âª Men. âª

Uh, sorry, looks like
it's gonna be

a little longer
than we expected.

Uh, any chance you know how
to put together a bike?

Right now, I'm too buzzed
to have a tool in my hand.

I'm just buzzed enough
to have a tool in mine.

Well, ho, ho, ho.

Exactly.

Here.

Let me get us both
a little more eggnog.

Um, Santa, did you drive your
own sleigh over here tonight?

Nope. Santa Ubered.

Oh, well, uh, hope your driver
was named Rudolph.

Um, so what's going on?

Does Santa know you're married?

Does the IRS know
you don't have five children?

Marty and I have
an open marriage.

And since he's 93,

my end opens a little more
frequently than his.

As does your mouth.

That's one of the ends
I was talking about.

Here you go.

You're running low on eggnog,
so this one is all rum.

Thank you.

You know, this is a situation

where Santa doesn't
need a little helper.

So on, Prancer.

Fine.

But just know this:

I am not afraid to give Santa
a negative review on Yelp.

âª Men. âª

Okay, I can't make heads
or tails of these instructions.

They're barely in English.

Uh, âThe bolts of turning

âshall revolve clockwords

as in above figure below.â

Does it say anything about
roommate of cheapness shall have

foot inserted
in back hole till tight?

Oh.

I guess on the first day
of Christmas,

my true love threatened me.

I'm sorry, but it's Louis's

first Christmas
not in the group home,

and I want it to be perfect.

No Christmas is ever perfect.

There's always gonna be a toy

that's broken
or the wrong kind of batteries.

I mean, even on
the very first Christmas,

Mary and Joseph woke up
to the smell of donkey crap.

I know. I just...

I want him to believe in Santa,

and-and get this bike

and-and wake up to a
winter wonderland.

Not that I ordered
a truckload of snow.

I didn't get reindeer!

Well, they're endangered.

We could still make
Christmas special for Louis.

We just got to finish this bike.
We can do this.

You're right. We got
an M.I.T. engineer and a...

formerly board-certified
chiropractor.

Yeah, now we're talking.

I mean, this can't
be more difficult

than realigning someone's spine.

Here.
You know, you got, uh...

you got your, uh, your L2,
uh, connected to your L3.

And all we have to do is

put the right pressure
on the right spot and...

Uh, and that is why I am

a formerly board-certified
chiropractor.

âª Men. âª

Oh, Santa.

Oh, Santa!

Oh, no.

Here comes Santa Claus!

Here comes
Santa Claus!

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Oh, my God.

What happened?

I saw Mommy banging Santa Claus.

What?
It's 1972 all over again.

We have a problem.

Yes, you have a problem.

You are the Christmas whore!

Be that as it may, I think
I killed Santa Claus.

Oh, God!

It's exactly like 1972!

âª Men. âª

Is he gonna be okay?

Yeah, It was just
atrial fibrillation.

He just needs some medication
and a few days rest.

You hear that, sweetheart?
I'll be fine by New Year's.

I'll be counting down
till the balls drop.

Well, thank God Louis
didn't see any of this.

He would've been
traumatized.

Louis? What about me?

The man almost died
while he was having sex with me.

That's not easy to get over.

No matter how many times
it happens.

Okay, well, all right,
well, there you have it.

Merry Christmas, Louis.

Your grandmother banged Santa
within an inch of his life.

Here's half a bike!

W-We can salvage this.

There's still enough time
to-to finish the bike,

wrap the other gifts
and get them under the tree.

Okay, you're right.

Louis will be asleep
for six more hours.

Walden?

Oh, come on!

I heard a noise. Did Santa come?

Sadly, no.

âª Men. âª

All right.

Where's Evelyn?

Oh, well, uh...

she went to her house
to play with...

her toys.

All right, time for bed, bud.

That's right. Santa's on his way.
All right.

If Santa is real,

then how does he get in all
the kids' houses in one night?

Well, he's got
Christmas magic.

And how does he know
where everybody lives?

Well... that's the magic
of Google Maps.

All right.

Good night, buddy.
Time to go to sleep.

Can you guys stay with me
till I fall asleep?

Sure.
Yeah.

It's not like we need to help
Santa assemble toys.

He pays his elves
$75 to do that.

That's Timothy's spot.

Oh, oh, okay.

Um...

I guess, uh...

Good boy.

âª Men. âª

Alan?

Mm-hmm?

Oh, oh, my God!

Oh, don't flatter yourself.

I get one every morning.

Where's Louis?

Hmm?

It's 7:00.
We fell asleep.

Oh, crap. Th-The bike.

The presents.
What are we gonna do?

Well, is it too late to
tell him we're Jewish?

What the...

Santa came! He is real!

Did you...?

No.

He's on the video.

You didn't see Grandma Evelyn
wrestling with Santa, did you?

No, just Santa.

That's...

Santa.

Oh, my God.

If the Easy Bake Oven
I have always wanted

is under that tree,
it is gonna blow my mind.

Can I go outside
and ride my bike?

Sure.

Alan, do you
want to...?

Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

Uh, let's go, buddy.

Looks like we had
a great Christmas

and saved $75.

Rose?

All right, come on, Rose,
I know you're down there.

Actually, I'm
behind you.

Ah, son of a...!

How do you do that?

Why do you do that?!

Oh, a girl's got to have
a little fun.

Merry Christmas.

I-I cannot believe that you
went to all that trouble for us.

You mean you can't believe
Santa went to all that trouble.

Okay, then I guess

I need to say
thank you to Santa.

Well, he doesn't
do it for the thanks,

he does it because
he genuinely wants

to make the people
in his life happy.

Are you happy, Walden?

I am.

I-I couldn't have imagined
a better Christmas morning.

I mean, other than waking up
with Alan poking me in the back.

Listen, I...

I'm sorry that I said
I didn't want you around.

Oh, please.

It's not like every time
somebody says

something mean to me, I write
it down in a big book called

âThose Who Have Wronged Me.â

That's funny.

I think.

Well, I told you before,
I just want to be your friend.

Well, you are.

And...

I'm sorry if I forgot that.

Oh.

Oh, hey, but how did Santa

manage to put
that bike together?

The instructions couldn't
have been any clearer.

âThe bolts of turning
shall revolve clockwords

as in above figure below.â

Duh.

Yeah. Duh.

Do you guys have
big plans for later?

Uh, no, just the usual.

Open gifts, call family,

hope that you get
their voice mail.

Oh, the best part is
Alan's gonna deep-fry a turkey,

so there's a 50/50 chance
he'll catch himself on fire.

Oh, I got you guys

a little something
for the house.

And I hope that every time
you look at it,

you'll think of me.

Oh! A cuckoo clock.

I get it. 'Cause you're...

What?

No.

Because it's red like a rose.

How could you
hurt me on Christmas?

I'm sorry. I-I...

I thought it was...
Oh, I'm just kidding.

No, it's totally
'cause I'm cuckoo.

Well, Merry Christmas, Walden.

Merry Christmas, Rose.

How cute is that?
It's a tiny Rose.

Wait, is that her real hair?

No, it's yours.

âª Men. âª

âª You better watch out,
you better not cry âª

âª You better not pout... âª
You know,

this is what Christmas
is all about.

Family, BublÃ©,

deep-fried turkey.

Life is good, Alan.

Hmm. It is.

Um, can you cut mine for me?

Deep-fried fingers.

That was sweet of Rose.
Yeah.

You know, I-I've always
been so cynical of her.

Maybe she does just want
to be friends, you know?

âª Now, he sees you
when you're sleeping... âª

Can we kiss again?
Yeah.

Do you want to go up to my...
Let's go.

Oh...

Walden, can you come here?

It's fine.
I-I've waited for two years.

I can wait a little bit longer.

Walden?

Parenting rule number four:
sleep is better than sex.

âª Men. âª
All right, Louis,

let's go over
the rules again.

We don't talk to strangers.

Don't climb the rock wall alone.

And?

We don't eat anything
we find in the ball pit.

All right, now,
go have fun.

All right, Alan,

let's go over your rules.

Uh, if I find a wallet,
I have to turn it in.

Uh, no haggling
over the corn dog prices.

And?

No standing underneath the moms

on the rock wall.
The rock wall. Yes.

Oh, great.

What?

Laurel's here.

Oh.

So go talk to her.

What am I supposed to say?
"I'm sorry about our date.

"It's just that I prefer
sleeping with a six-year-old kid

to sleeping with you."

Oh, oh, it's okay. I'm-I'm
talking about my own son.

You know,
maybe I'll just avoid her.

If I wanted to avoid every woman
I ever embarrassed myself

in front of,
I'd never leave the house.

I'd even have to steer clear
of the UPS lady.

She looked in the window
and caught me...

handling my own package.

You know,
it's not the things that you do,

so much as the way
that you say them.

No, no.

It-It's also the things
that you do.

Okay, you know,
I just wish there was a way

to, like,
jump over the awkwardness

and get right
into the conversation with her.

You know what, I think I can...
I can help you with that.

Laurel!

Look who's here! And awake!

Hey, guys.

I'll, uh... I'll leave
you two lovebirds alone.

I'm gonna go check on Louis.

Hey, remember how we used
to have to pretend to be gay?

Crazy, right?

I'm sorry I didn't call.

And I'm-I'm sorry

I fell asleep instead
of having sex with you. I...

Will you stop
walking by?

I really am sorry.

I'm not mad.

Though you are now in my phone
as Rip Van Walden.

I'm sorry, what was that?
I just nodded off.

So, what you been up to?

Oh, you know, not much. Just...

training for a marathon,

developing an international
photo sharing app,

and I'm writing
a young adult novel.

Wow. Really?

No, I have a six-year-old.

All I do is come here
and eat food on a stick.

Well, do you want to... maybe...

schedule another playdate?

I would love that.

I mean, Lily would love that.
Oh.

Louis would also love it.

Imagine

all the... games

that they would play together.

Yeah. And all the, uh, toys
they would play with.

Toys? I-I hope none
of them are...

a choking hazard.

Wouldn't matter to me.

I don't have a gag reflex.

âª Men. âª

Morning.

How's the neck?

Not good.

Yeah. Well, I told you not
to stand under that mom

on the rock wall.

That's why we have rules!

Yeah, well, wearing underwear
on the rock wall

should be one of those.

Hey, Louis, are you excited
about your playdate with Lily?

I guess.

"I guess."

You got a cute girl
coming over here.

You should be
popping in the...

Kidz Bop Slow Jamz
and putting some Sunny D on ice.

Do I have to share my Legos
with her?

Of course not. It's a playdate.
You're not marrying her.

Alan.

Yes, we should share
everything we can--

our toys, our books, our...

sausage links.

If I could move

my neck, I'd give you such
a look right now.

The lesson is
that we should all share.

Okay. I got to poop.

Whoa! Whoa, what are you doing?

Sharing.

No. No, that's taking!

That's my job in this house!

âª Men. âª

So what's the deal?

Pinched nerve?
Slipped disk?

The official diagnosis?
You're old.

Very funny. I'd like
a second opinion.

All right,
you're also out of shape.

Come on, I'm in decent shape
for my age.

Eh...

Look, Alan, when you get
to be our age,

you get a little more fragile.

You-you don't
bounce back as easily.

The only thing
that bounces back is that belly

when I poke it.

Stop it.

I used to be
in the same boat as you.

Then I found
this awesome new gym,

put myself
on a regular workout program.

Now I'm in the best shape
of my life.

Surprised you didn't notice.

Oh. Oh, yeah.
You, uh... you look great.

It's too late, Alan.
The damage has been done.

You should come down
and work out with me.

It's, uh, nothing
but hot women in yoga pants

as far as the eye can see.

Sure, it's a little creepy
if you look right at 'em,

but, uh, there are mirrors
everywhere.

Yeah. I guess I could break out

the old headband
and leg warmers.

Great. Hey, uh,
since I got you here,

it's, uh... it's been a year
since your last prostate exam.

Oh, no.

If it makes you feel any better,
you get a lollipop afterwards.

Well, I've done a lot more
for a lot less.

âª Men. âª

Aw.
Aw.

It's like the eye
of a hurricane.

It's eerily quiet now,
but in an hour

everything will be broken
and wet.

Well, at least I'm not the
only one who falls asleep

when cute girls
are around.

Aw. Thanks so much
for having us.

I'm very impressed
with this spread.

What kind of cheese is this?

Uh...

okay, I have to confess.

They're Lunchables.

That's the yellow cheese,

but I also have the orange
and the white.

No. No, thanks. I'm gonna save
room for the Fruit Roll-Up.

So tell me,

how is it that a guy like you
is not already married

to some-- I don't know--
gorgeous swimsuit model?

Okay, you obviously haven't seen
Alan in a Speedo.

I'm-I'm serious.

You're sweet, you're
good-looking, you're successful.

What the hell is wrong with you?

Okay. I've been told...

that I listen too much.

Which is a common problem

among men
whose penises are too large.

Uh, well, I-I also have this...

this teeny, tiny quirk
where, uh,

I screw up relationships as soon
as they start going well.

Oh. That's encouraging.

Oh, oh. No, no, no.
But don't worry, uh,

'cause this isn't going well
at all.

Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that

'cause... I was
about to leave.

Oh.

Mmm, okay.
That-that kind of behavior

can get you put in time-out.

Time-outs don't work on me.

I need to be spanked.

Looks like someone needs
to be sent to my room.

Wow. Look at the Lululemons
on her.

Did I tell you
or did I tell you?

Yeah.
Be cool, though.

Getting tagged as a lurker
is a hard label to shake.

So I've heard.

Oh, oh, check
out the redhead.

Her shorts say "Juicy."

If our garments
are being honest,

mine would say "Aroused."

Ooh, look at the blonde
on the yoga ball.

Mmm, bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy...

Lyndsey?

Alan.

How did I not recognize her?

I've got to look
at more faces.

I didn't know
you were a member here.

Herb.

I see they've reinstated
your membership.

The appeals process
was arduous,

but, ultimately,
justice was served.

So, uh, how's everything?

Good. I'm sober again.

I traded booze for exercise.

You know, whenever I want a
drink, I come here instead.

Good thing this place
is open 24 hours.

Well, I'm really happy for you.
You look great.

I also think
you look great.

In fact,
as a medical professional,

my opinion is "wowza."

Thanks. Anyway, I got to go.

It's time for my spin class.

Oh, so, uh...
so you went from a-a room

that was spinning
to a room for spinning.

You know... glug,
glug, glug, glug.

Anyway, great seeing you.

Yeah.

I missed this.

Wow, she looks amazing.

Did you see how flat
her stomach is?

She's always had great abs.
All that dry heaving

gives you a hell
of a six-pack.

So, uh, you two are over?

Oh, yeah. You know,
it's complicated with me

and Walden and Louis.
Plus, you know, I don't know

that Lyndsey and I were
ever really good for each other.

Kind of like me and lactose.

That's too bad.
Mmm.

Mind if I take a crack at her?

What?

You two aren't together anymore.

Maybe the cure for what ails her
is a little Herb-Al essence.

Dude, you already married
my ex-wife,

you moved into my house,
and earlier today

you had your finger halfway
to my liver.

Maybe we share enough as it is.

Okay, I get it. Bro code.

Thank you.

Just so you know, that exam
was no picnic for me, either.

Did you hear that?

I think it was the
kids downstairs.

What kids?

Oh.

You're right.
It was probably nothing.

Oh, wait. What if one of them
walks in on us?

I had a hard enough time
explaining

where milk comes from.

Do you want to lock the door?

Yes.

Mmm. Oh, no, no, no.

What if there's an emergency?

What if they need
to come get us?

What-what... what if
there's a burglar or a fire,

or a burglar who sets a fire
as a distraction?

Oh, no, no.

Not on my watch!

Oh, my God, you're adorable.

But if you can't stop worrying
all the time,

you're never gonna
have sex again.

Oh, my God.

I'm never gonna have sex again.

You're used
to single-people sex.

That's a luxurious four-course
meal at a fine restaurant.

Parent sex is a drive-through.

Get in, get out,

hope you don't get anything
on your shirt.

Oh.

Looks like your order
just got supersized.

Walden?

Yes! Coming! Right there!

Oh, God, are you okay?

I'm fine. Good news is,
you finally got my bra off.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Morning.

Morning. Where's Louis?

I sent him to take a bath.

Oh, by the way, if you want
syrup on your French toast,

catch him before
he hits the water.

No. No French toast for me.

I'm hitting the gym
a little later.

Oh, uh, by the way,
the beach is that way.

Oh, look at that.

Uh, my fitness band says
that my pulse rate is 87.

Tell me when it
gets to zero.

Yeah, joke all you want,

but this little gizmo tracks
all my physical activity.

So far today, I have burned...
400 calories.

Oh, wow. Did you go for a run?

Nope, never left my bed.

Oh, come on!

So, how was your playdate
with Laurel?

Okay, let-let me...
let me ask you guys something.

When you had young kids, and
they were still in the house,

did you have a hard time,
like... you know...

âª Bow chicka wow wow? âª

Oh. Oh, well, Jake walked in on
Judith and me countless times.

Eventually, we stopped
having sex altogether.

Those aren't related.

I just...
I don't know what to do.

It's like, Louis is stealing
your sausage and blocking mine.

Well, sooner or later,
you just get over it.

Uh, but in the meantime,
why don't you take her out

for a romantic night to a hotel?

Oh. I like that.

Plus, people do all kinds
of things in hotels

they don't do at home.

Like pay eight dollars
for peanuts.

I used to love
to have sex in hotel rooms.

Then they caught me,
and they fired me.

âª Men. âª

Do you want to work in?

What?

Oh, oh, uh, work in, yeah.

Uh, definitely want to work in.

Why else would I be
sitting here?

Thanks.
No problem.

Just, uh, show you
the proper technique.

Mm.

Here we go.

Aah! Oh, aah.

Bum shoulder. Yeah.

Got it the last Iron Man.

The movie, not the triathlon.

I slipped in the lobby
on some artificial butter.

Oh.

There we go,
lighten the load, and, uh...

One time, here we go.

Oh, God!

Nice meeting you!

Hey, Alan.

Oh. Oh, hey,
Lyndsey. Oh, hey.

Yeah, I was just, uh...

I was just doing the,
uh, the fly machine.

You know, working out.

You're really committing
to this workout thing.

I'm impressed.

I know. I haven't been anyplace
two days in a row

since Jersey Boys was touring.

Where's Herb?
Uh, in the office.

He got all excited about
an outbreak of pinkeye.

When kids see pink,
Herb sees green.

Well, tell him I said "hi."

Oh, I don't know

if that's such
a great idea.

What do you mean?

Well, get this.

Uh, after we saw you
the other day,

he wanted to know
if it was okay to ask you out.

But don't worry. I told him no.

What?

You have no right
to decide who I go out with.

Oh, come on, Lyndsey.
I mean, how would you feel

if one of your friends wanted
to go out with me?

Shocked, stunned,
like I need new friends.

Look, I am just trying to help.

You just got sober.

I mean, before you move
onto somebody else,

you should probably
get over your breakup

with Captain Morgan.

Are you freaking kidding me?!

If I want to go out with Herb,
it is none of your business.

In fact, nothing I do
is any of your business!

Just stay the hell
out of my life!

Roid rage.

Phew.

âª Men. âª

Okay.

This was officially
a great idea.

Did you like the way
I checked us in?

Mr. and Mrs. R. Doinit?

Um, I like to go
by my maiden name--

Gettin' Some.

Hey, check this out.

I just walked across the floor
without stepping on a Lego.

Look, there's chocolate
on the pillows,

and it's not even in the shape
of a handprint.

Oh. Get over here, woman.
Uh-uh.

No, no. I've got
a surprise for you.

A surprise?

Mm-hmm.
Yay! What is it?

Oh, I'll give you a hint.

It's lacy, it's new, and you get
to bite the tags off.

If it's big enough
to have tags on it,

I already don't like it.

âª Men. âª

Alan, what are you doing here?

Well, I felt bad about earlier,
and I wanted to apologize.

These are for you.

For me, huh?

"Mr. Schmidt, thank you so much
for your generous donation

to the children's hospital."

Um, I-I did not see that.

Is that the pizza guy?

Herb?

Alan, what are you doing here?

What are you doing here, and...
and why are you wearing my robe?

I'll let you guys talk.

Alan, you showing up here
is the second best thing

that's happened to me today.

What the hell, Herb?

Believe me, I had no intention
of going behind your back,

but out of nowhere, Lyndsey
invited me over for dinner,

and I thought,
"What's the harm?"

Well, then, dinner
turned into dessert,

and dessert turned into,
well, sex with Lyndsey.

This hurts, Herb.

Yesterday you were
tickling my prostate,

and today you're
stabbing me in the back.

Hey, it's your fault.

You made me forbidden fruit.

I was off-limits,
like dancing in Footloose.

Look, I'm sorry
it happened like this.

And, well, if you want me
to stop seeing her,

just say the word,
and it's over.

Herb?

Well, you had your chance.

What do you think?

It's horrible. Take it off.

Oh!
Ooh!

No!

It's okay. Get it.

Okay, babysitter wants to know

if Lily can have ice cream
for dessert.

"Don't care. Getting laid."

No, I just wrote "Yes."

Oh, hey, you know, next time, we
should just get one babysitter,

and then Louis can sleep
over with Lily at my house,

and I can sleep over
with you at your house.

Yeah, maybe.

Wait, wait,
whoa, hold on.

Do you not want there
to be a next time?

I mean, please
reserve your judgment

until after the
first time.

I rarely

disappoint a woman sexually
before we have sex.

No, it's just...
all kids have their differences.

But I don't want to talk
about Louis and Lily right now.

In fact, I don't want
to talk at all.

I got better things
to do with my mouth.

Wait a second.
Wait a second. Hold on.

Wait. Louis and Lily
don't get along?

Well, you know how kids are.

One week, they like each other;
the next, they don't.

So Louis doesn't like to share.

Lucky for you, I do.

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

Louis does not have
a problem sharing.

In fact, I just talked to him
specifically about sharing.

I'm sorry. Lily must
have made it up.

That's probably it. Okay.

Wait a second.

So you're okay
with saying that Lily's a liar,

but you can't admit
that Louis has issues?

Oh. Okay, hold on.

I think I would know
if my son has issues.

Right, 'cause
you've been a parent

for all of, what, two weeks?

Two and a half.

And fancy you
lecturing me.

The mother of
Lily the biter.

What? Lily's not a biter.

All the other parents
call her "Lily-goat."

You know what?
This was a bad idea.

Oh, yeah, it was...

baa-aa-aa-aa-aad.

That was a sheep.

And if this is how
you talk to women in bed,

then no wonder
you had to marry Alan.

You will leave my husband
out of this!

You don't even know
what you're missing.

You were about to have
the hottest sex of your life!

Oh, oh, easy for you to say

since you don't have
to back it up.

Oh, you want me to back it up?!
'Cause I'll back it up!

Yeah, back it on up!

Oh, what, are we gonna have sex?

Shut up!
Oh...

Okay, I see where Lily
gets her biting.

Previously on
Two and a Half Men...

Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

but you two are
different somehow.

I know we can be
good parents.

It is my job to be
a hundred percent sure

before I place a child.

We are not believable
as a loving couple,

and I think that's why Ms.
McMartin wasn't sure about us.

All right, yeah.

We do that in front of Ms.
McMartin, we'll get ten babies.

âª Men. âª

Whew, that was fun.
Whew.

That was like
a roller coaster.

Yeah, we went up,
we went down.

There was the

Yeah, they-they say you want
to sit in the front,

but I had a great time
in the back.

Yeah, you know, I'm not sure
about that picture

we took at the end.

I think I was making
a funny face.

Yeah.

Hey, have you ever gotten busy
in a public place,

like a theme park,
before?

I mean, uh, there was one
time in the Chicago airport.

I met this girl
on a long layover.

Let's just say my bag was
never left unattended.

What about you?

Well, if you get me
a hot cup of coffee,

I'll, uh, tell you about my high
school trip to Mount Rushmore.

Okay, please tell me it
doesn't involve four old guys

on top of a mountain.

I went to
an all-girls school.

Coffee, coming up!

Oh, hey.
Hey.

Okay, I don't know
what was going on

up there with
Laurel, but...

Rich, handsome and a master
of the boudoir.

You're everything
I think I am when I'm drunk.

What can I say?

I got a magical tongue, and
I can breathe through my ears.

Were you just sitting down here,
listening to Laurel and me?

No, that would be sad.

I was also couponing.

Hey.

How's my favorite
couple?

My bros without hos.

Ms. McMartin, uh...

What are you doing here?

Well, I told you guys
the state requires

a couple surprise inspections to
check in on Louis's home life.

Surprise!

I am definitely
surprised.

Clearly...
Captain Underpants.

Oh.

Right, yeah, well,
I wasn't expect...

You know, Louis isn't here; he's
actually, he's at a sleepover.

So, I guess you came all this
way to see me in my Skivvies.

Worth the trip in my book.

Instagram.

Hashtag: he's bringing
booty back.

Thanks, honey.

Uh, well, it was, uh,
it was good to see you.

Oh, actually, I can just
talk to you guys.

Great, even better.

Come on in.

Uh, you know,
I'm gonna run upstairs

and put on some pants.

Walden?

Who was that?

Oh, that was my pants.

Here I come, pants!

Stay there!

What are you talking about?

Oh, hi. Sorry.

You lied to me.

I never would have
placed Louis here had I known

you guys weren't
actually a couple.

I can explain.
Oh, go ahead, I'd love to hear it.

She's my sister.

Where was that
five minutes ago?

There's no explanation
for what you did.

I may have to remove Louis.

Okay, I-I know
this looks bad,

but our hearts were
in the right place.

Yeah, even if our
penises weren't.

Th-The only thing
that we're guilty of

is putting on
a little show.

A little show?

Every time I see this one,
he acts like he's auditioning

to host the Tonys.

N-No, that's just Alan.

Yeah, i-it's true.

Uh, name any musical,
anybody.

Okay, uh, West Side Story.

âª I like to be

âª Okay by me in America âª

âª Everything free

Okay, stop.

Well, excuse me,
Officer Krupke.

Listen, we may
not be gay,

but we are definitely
a stable couple.

Yeah, until the adoption
is final,

and then you'll,
what, get divorced?

Are you kidding me?

If this one
has his way,

he's gonna be with me
for the rest of my life.

Longer.

I bought us side-by-side
cemetery plots.

No, he's not kidding.

And he gave it to
me for my birthday,

and I pretended
to like it,

because that's what
loving couples do.

You pretended to like it?

See that?
See, that's real.

And I'm gonna hear about it
for the rest of the night.

Y-You want to take Louis
away from us

just because we don't
have sex?

I mean, I can
honestly tell you

that we have
as much sex as I had

in either of
my previous marriages.

None of that matters.

N-No, of course
it matters.

Because we're
not lying.

We are best friends,
and we are married.

And we do love
each other.

And I'm sorry, but just, you
know, how many people can say

that they are married
to their best friend?

Alan Harper-Schmidt can.

My job is to do what's in
the best interest of the child.

Now I have to reevaluate
what that is.

But him living here...

No, I don't want to hear
anything else from you guys.

I'll be in touch.

I can't lose this kid.

D-Don't go there.
Nothing's been decided yet.

Well, other than
the fact

that you don't want
to be buried next to me.

This is a disaster.

We're gonna lose everything
that we worked for

over one stupid mistake.

I mean, uh, I wish
I had those shoulders.

And, uh, and

That's Timothy; he's Aquaman.

Why can't I be Aquaman?

Because Aquaman can

That's right.

We're a team

Can we go to the park?

I don't see why not.

Yes, we have to live

And you ask why

Hey, why don't you go
and get your shoes on,

and we'll get
going, okay?

Cool!

You're the best
dad ever.

Oh, my God.

Did you hear that?

He used the "D" word.

I more than heard it, I felt it.

But I am not gonna cry.

That's right.

We got to stay strong
in front of the kid.

We can't let him know
something's going on.

'Cause that's
what a... a good dad does.

I'm gonna go get
my jacket.

I feel so bad for him.

Well, what are you gonna
do about it?

There's nothing I can do.

Just gonna throw in the towel
before the first round?

What?

Let me put it in terms
you'll understand.

You're crapping your tutu
before the ballet starts.

After all that Walden's
done for you,

you have to help him
keep ahold of Louis.

How?
I don't know.

But if there is anybody
in the world that can figure out

how to keep somebody
in this house, it's you.

âª Men. âª

Um, is this
seat taken?

Uh, actually, no, it's...

What are you doing here?

Did you follow me?

No.

But I knew you were here
because of the picture

you posted of
your bruschetta.

This is completely
inappropriate.

And only jackasses
say "brew-sketta."

Just-just hear me out, I need
to talk to you about Louis.

The time to talk to me
about Louis was

before you lied to me
to get him.

I only need
five minutes.

I-I'll even pay
for your dinner.

I mean, if you
really knew me,

you'd know what a
big deal that is.

Fine, five minutes.

Thank you.

Oh, and if you want
anything else, order fast--

the happy hour prices
are about to go away.

What do you have to say?

Look...

Walden is really
a great guy.

All he wanted
was to be a dad,

and he tried everything
he could think of.

I mean, he only married me
because I was his last resort.

I'm like peeing in
a Gatorade bottle

when you're
stuck in traffic.

Nobody wants to do it, but
sometimes it's your only option.

You know what
a last resort looks like?

Like a 33-year-old woman who
devoted herself to her career

because she had nothing else
and then realized

she's not even good at that
because she screwed up

and gave a kid to two guys
pretending to be a gay couple.

I was just named
employee of the month.

Now I can't even use
my $25 Target gift card

without feeling guilty.

You are a good employee
and a good person.

And, if it'll help, I'll, uh,
I'll buy the gift card off you.

Uh, what's fair?

Ten? 15? Ten?

You know,
the worst part of this is

I actually liked you guys.

I put your Christmas card
on my fridge.

Now I don't even know
who you are.

Who are those people
on my fridge?!

We're the same two people
that you trusted Louis with

in the first place.

This whole thing is
a nightmare.

Do you realize
I could lose my job?

I have five cats to support.

I know, and I-I
feel terrible

that we put you
in this position.

Our only intent was to give
a child in need a good home.

Well, I suppose I can't
fault you for that.

Great.

So...

we're done here, we
get to keep Louis,

and I'll give you eight
bucks for the gift card.

I wish it was that simple.

I just don't know
what the right thing to do is.

Okay, well, y-you don't
have to decide right now.

Let's, uh, let's
talk about it.

Um, uh, can I get an appletini,
uh, sugar rim, extra zest?

You don't have to pretend
to be gay anymore.

Oh-oh, yeah, uh,
right, uh, uh...

Uh, make it a mojito.

Skinny.

So, uh, what do you
say, Ms. McMartin?

Uh, another
Chardonnay?

Eh, what the hell?

It's not like this week
could get any worse.

I can't believe
I'm doing this.

I can't believe you're
doing this either.

Oh, oh, Alan.

Oh, Ms. McMartin.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

This is a disaster.

I'm sorry.

Come on, man.

You like her.
Rise and shine.

What is wrong with me?

Oh, no, no,
it's not you.

Uh, although, if I, uh,
if I did have one note, uh,

the beige granny panties
didn't exactly move the needle.

They're nude-colored,
and they are my work panties.

Although your use
of the word "needle"

is anatomically accurate.

I am a grower,
not a shower.

Why do I always make
such a mess of things?

I'm sorry.

Don't be.

The crying's
actually helping.

What?

Um, your weeping
reminds me

of having sex with
my first wife.

How did I get here?

I went to Stanford.

I turned down a job on Wall
Street to help save the world,

and now I'm in bed
with an old guy

who can't get a boner!

Um, actually, that is
no longer the case.

Seatbacks and
tray tables

are in their full
upright position.

Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

Get out.

Oh. Oh, okay.

Um...

I, uh...

I, uh, hope this won't affect
your decision about Louis.

I would hate it
if you held my flaccid penis

against Walden.

âª Men. âª

Oh, hey.

Um, you're...
you're still up.

It's 8:15.

Oh, to be young again.

So, uh, what have
you been doing?

Oh, I-I was, uh,
making a video montage

of the time we spent with Louis.
You want to see it?

Yeah. Yeah, great.

âª Ooh, child,
things are gonna get eas... âª

That's it?

Yeah, we really should have
taken more pictures.

Where have you been?

Oh, I, uh... I, uh...

I went to, uh,
see Ms. McMartin.

Are you kidding me?

She told us to
leave her alone.

Alan, when people say that
to you, they mean it.

Remember how you're not allowed
to go to Subway anymore

and suggestively ask
for "double meat"?

I-I was just trying
to help us keep Louis.

Okay, tell me
exactly what you did

so I can start to undo it.

O-Okay. Um, I followed her
to a bar...

Oh, God!

This is like the time
that we saw Kelly Ripa

outside the grocery store!

No. No, no, no.

So we-we had a few drinks,

uh, and the funny part is,
um, we ended up in bed.

You had sex with Ms. McMartin?!

No!

No, I did not.

I was unable
to maintain an erection.

This has gone from bad to worse.
I might start crying.

I wouldn't.

âª Men. âª

How you doing?

I've been better.

Well, you want
to forget the pain

or you want to forget your name?

Got anything
to help me forget Alan?

If I did, I'd be asking you,
"Who's Alan?"

Listen, don't let
yourself get too down.

It's like
I tell my daughters,

no use crying
until the verdict's read.

I tried to sway
Ms. McMartin.

She won't even
take my calls.

Well, someone
ought to tell her

that you are the best thing
that ever happened for that kid.

I'm just worried about

what will happen to him if
she doesn't let me keep him.

Being a foster kid
makes you tough.

Before he goes, I'll teach him

how to make a shiv
out of a Krazy Straw.

Thanks.

I needed a laugh.

Yeah, 'cause I'm kidding.

I don't want him
to leave either.

He's a good kid,
isn't he?

Yeah.

If I lose him,
all I'm gonna have

is a five-second
photo montage

and a picture of Alan
as Wonder Woman.

Look, we're all
in this together.

Anything I can do for you,
you let me know.

Thanks.
I appreciate it.

You know, if you happen to
know a guy who specializes

in making a father
and son disappear,

you just might want to
keep that number handy.

I do know a guy

that could sneak 80 pounds
into the country.

I don't see why he couldn't
sneak 80 pounds out.

âª Men. âª

Ms. McMartin is
15 minutes late.

You know, we might be
a fraudulently gay couple,

but at least we're punctual.

We're not the only ones
who lied.

I know for a fact that blonde
is not her natural hair color.

That's her.

Yeah, and she better watch it,

'cause I am
in mama grizzly mode.

Promise me
you won't make this

more awkward
than it already is.

You got it, of course.

Ms. McMartin.

Hello, Walden.

Alan.

'Sup, girl?

Who's here?

Oh, hey, buddy.

Uh, it's Ms. McMartin.

Hi, Louis.

Hi.

Hey, why don't you go
in your room and play, uh,

while the grown-ups
talk for a little.

Sure.
Okay.

You see how
he handled that?

"Let the
grown-ups talk."

Supportive and gentle,

not unlike your delightful
beige work panties.

Alan, let the grown-ups talk.

I've thought about this
a long time,

and nobody wanted this
to work out more than I did.

Please don't do this.

I have to do my job,

and the fact of the matter is
you lied.

You committed fraud.

But we are
legally married.

He is my best friend.

We're-we're good parents.

And-and clearly,
we love each other.

Yes.

The-the only thing
that we don't do

is, well, "love" each other.

But if that's the only reason
that we don't get to keep Louis,

i-is because
I don't put my man parts

into Alan's...
mostly man parts...

...then we will have sex
right here in front of you.

I mean... come on, Alan.

Oh, okay.

Um...

Guys, stop.

No, I am serious!

I will have sex with Alan
right here

on the living room floor
if we get to keep this kid!

Now, how can you say

that this isn't
a great home for a child?

I know you're upset.

I am, too.

But I've made up my mind.

No!

This can't be it!

I'm ready.

What are you doing, buddy?

Whenever Ms. McMartin comes

and the grown-ups start yelling,
I get taken away.

Oh, man.

I'm very sorry, Louis.

What's going on?

She's taking him.

What?

Hey, Blondie, how many people
know you're here?

Berta, it's okay.

And she's not
a real blonde.

Come here.

I want you to know that
this isn't your fault.

You didn't do anything wrong
and you're a great kid.

I really liked it here.

We are, uh... we're
gonna miss you, kiddo.

Me, too.

Here.

No.

T-Timothy's your
best friend.

He'll be your
best friend now.

Bye, Louis.

Bye. Bye, Berta.

So long, kid.

Come on, Louis.

I can't do this.

What?

No, the whole reason
I took this job

was to help kids.

No matter how
we got here,

this is the best place for him.

Oh, this is amazing.

Come here, buddy. Oh!

Did you grow while
you were gone?

No.

No?

Get ready for
a mama bear hug.

Mama bear.

Oh, my goodness, thank you.

No more lies.

No.

Unless my boss
finds out about this.

Then I totally need you to lie.

Glad to have
you back, kid.

Oh, and, Ms. McMartin,

you might want to stay
away from your house

until I can make
some phone calls.

Okay! Okay!

Let's put your stuff
away, buddy.

Hey, you know what?

You can have this now,

'cause I got
my best friend back.

Technically, I'm
your best friend.

And I never left.

Still, a touching moment.

That was really sweet of you.

I feel good about it.

Today you earned
your Target gift card.

Thanks.

No, thank you.

Oh. Oh, are you...
are you crying?

Yes, but... tears of joy.

Those work, too.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª
Wow!

That was amazing!

Yep.

Alan may disappoint
sometimes,

but a little blue
pill never does.

Hey, could I ask you
a personal question?

What do you consider personal?

I already let you try on
my work panties.

Well... how do I put this?

Ms. McMartin,
what's your first name?

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

I can't believe it.

I know.

Since you let me do it to you,
I had to let you do it to me.

Not that.

Although, remind me
to throw away that cat toy.

No, I meant the fact
that you are cheating

on your husband to sleep
with your social worker.

You just described a fantasy
I didn't know I had.

Naughty social worker.

Show me on the doll
where I should touch you.

Okay, I need to keep
romantically what I do here

separate from what I do
professionally out there.

Even though, in both cases,

I seem to work
with the jobless and homeless.

I think we have a
professional relationship.

You gave us a kid,
I gave you an orgasm.

Well, technically,
both of those are still pending.

But I'm serious.

If we're gonna do this, we have
to establish some boundaries.

I mean, I'm overseeing Walden's
adoption of Louis.

Right, right, I-I really
don't want to mess that up.

It's just that I-I like
spending time with you.

And I--

to my surprise--

like spending time with you.

I'm kind of like
poison ivy.

You don't realize you've been
exposed until you get that itch.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Oh, what's that?

Yes, I am wearing
the same clothes as last night.

Ask not for whom
the booty calls.

The booty calls for me.

So I assume
you're not gonna stop

until I ask who it was.

A gentleman doesn't
kiss and tell,

but I'm no gentleman,

and it's hard to kiss
a woman from behind.

Alan, okay, who was it?

I banged our social worker.

Ms. McMartin?

Again?

What can I say?

She gave my penis a good home.

I thought this was gonna be
something that you did once,

like manscaping
with a straight razor.

Please don't
mess this up for me.

Oh, no, no, it's
a good thing.

Uh, plus, we-we really
like each other,

And we agreed
to respect boundaries.

You know-- personal life,
professional life.

Okay, and what boundaries
are you respecting

when you're bragging
about having sex with her?

That's just something a man
wants to share with his husband.

Oh, oh, that's
Ms. McMartin.

She's here to
check up on Louis.

It was supposed
to be a surprise.

Wait up, hold on...

She told you this?

No, she didn't tell me--
we have boundaries.

I saw it on her phone when I
was going through her texts.

Hello, Walden.

Ms. McMartin.

Hi.

What a surprise.

Come on in.

Hey, girl.

You are social workin' it.

Can I get you anything?

Like a new boyfriend?

Okay, so obviously
Alan told you about us.

Uh, yes, he has.

Look, I want
you to know

this will in no way affect
our professional relationship.

I am here strictly as your
and Louis's caseworker.

And let me tell you
something right now,

I want to back that case up.

You know, Alan, the lucky thing
is that after I smack you,

there's already a social worker
here to report it to.

So how is everything
going with Louis?

You know, it's good.

Uh, but I have
a couple questions.

Like... like, okay, for example,

what's the best way
to discipline him?

Uh, I believe she
favors spanking.

All right, what do I say

when he asks
about his biological parents?

And how much cheese
is too much cheese?

Okay, how about we just do
one question at a time?

Okay, okay.

There's some cultural
things, like--

should I teach him
a cool handshake,

or does that just make me lame?

Good question, bro.

Blow it up.

You know what might help?

Talking to other foster parents.

Actually,
some of my dads have started

an informal support group.

They kick around these kind
of questions every week.

Oh, that'd be
great for you.

Uh, I went to a group
for divorced dads,

and it really helped.

Uh, I also went to a group
for people whose moms died,

but, uh, that was
just wishful thinking.

âª Men. âª

Hey, buddy.
Berta's gonna watch you

when I go to
my meeting tonight, okay?

Okay.

We're gonna have
a lot of fun.

Remember the last time when we
learned about animals and math?

Yep.
Wow, what'd you learn?

A trifecta is a sucker bet.

And?

Horses run faster when
they poop before the race.

The kid's a sponge.

Good morning.

Speaking of sponges.

I got my first dads group tonight.
Oh.

And before that, Louis and
I are gonna go to the movies.

Then I'm gonna hit the gym.

Oh, you know what?

Why don't we go
to the gym first?

That way,
we can steal some waters

so we can sneak them
into the movies.

You want to go?

Uh, isn't today when you go
to the farmer's market

and bargain for bruised peaches?

I can just go
to the supermarket.

They're all bruised
when you bring a Sharpie.

I want to spend
the day with you.

Oh, great.

You know, it's just that I-I was
gonna head straight from the gym

to the meeting.

So...

if you go...

Oh, oh, I get it.
Say no more.

Thank you.

You can just drop me off
on your way.

Mmm, what do you want
for dinner?

I don't know.

Who thinks about dinner

when you're still
swallowing your breakfast?

I'll have hot dogs.

Where are you going?

I'm gonna do something
to help me run faster.

âª Men. âª

Hey, fellas,
the new guy's here.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hey, you going to
spin class, sweetie?

Yep. See you later.

Hey, I'm Rick.

Yes, she is,
but that was my wife.

My daughter's 40.

That's way too old for me.

This is Leo,
and that's Jack.

Hi. Hi.
Hey.
Hey, nice
to meet you.

That's, uh, Brian
over there.

Just had newborn twins, so
he just comes here to sleep.

Yeah, you could fart in his
face, he won't even wake up.

Ah.

Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

This place is amazing.

You got a bar,
and the pool table, and the TVs.

You just add some hot chicks,
orange paint and an owl,

and you got a Hooters.

Maybe Heidi can serve us beers
when she gets back.

Why not? That's what she was
doing when I met her.

So, uh, what's
your kid situation?

Uh, I got a boy.

Uh, his name's Louis.

He's six.

Nice. I got
three daughters.

I always wanted a son,
so, uh, we adopted Josh.

Now I got half
a girl's volleyball team

and a boy who wants
to be their cheerleader.

But I love him--
no judgment.

My wife and I adopted
a four-year-old girl, Micah.

I also do alarm systems,
in case you're in the market.

Give me your contact info,

I'll put you down
on my weekly e-mail blast.

All the guys get it.

Mark as spam.

That is funny.

Jack's alarm code is #227.

I got three grown kids
from my first marriage,

and Heidi and I just adopted
a seven-year-old girl.

Wow. You must really love kids.

Kids are fine.
What I love is Heidi.

You saw her.

When I was in college,

her mother was in sixth grade.

And if you think about it,

my next wife
isn't even born yet.

So, uh, why did you and
your wife choose to adopt?

My wife is incapable
of having children.

Oh.

Yeah, his name is Alan.

Oh.

A-Although, uh,

he did order boner pills
from China once

that made him lactate.

Uh,

so, anything going on
with Louis?

Yeah, you know,
I have a couple questions

that-that you're
the perfect person to answer.

Why is that?

'Cause I'm handsome? Charming?

College graduate?
Top home security specialist

in the South Bay
three years running?

Yes, that...

Louis is also all those things.

I'm just messing with you!

Yeah.

Ms. McMartin told us
your kid was mixed-race.

So what do you want to know?

Uh, do you want to know
how to comb his hair?

Uh, what type of music
to expose him to?

Do I need to teach
him a cool handshake?

So that's-that's actually
a thing?

Yeah, yeah. Here, let me
show you, let me show you.

Oh.

Huh? Huh?
Ooh.

That is cool.

And you just did it

to hand me your business card.

Yeah. If you tell me
that I sent you,

then you get 20% off.

By the way,
have you seen my wife?

âª Men. âª

Hey, uh, thanks
for having me.

You know, this is great.
I-I don't think I knew it,

but I needed a place like this.

You mean a place
to get away from our wives?

Preach!

Wait, why do you need a place?
You're married to a guy.

Your only problem is, do I
watch SportsCenter before,

during or after sex?

Uh, actually, it's-it's a little
more complicated than that.

What do you mean?

I mean, well, imagine...

all of the wife
and none of the sex.

Yeah, we don't need to imagine.
We're married, too.

I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

I get all the sex
I can handle.

Which, at my age,
is about once a month.

Can-can I share something
that doesn't leave this room?

Yeah, sure. Oh, these guys know
that back when I was single...

I used to bang his sister.

Okay, here's the thing.

I'm not gay.

I-I married my best friend

so I could adopt Louis.

Really?

Then you shouldn't have any
of these problems.

And yet I have all
of these problems.

I mean, that's why
it's so great coming here.

I get to get away from Alan.

I mean, he wants
to do everything with me.

He ordered a Groupon
for two-for-one prostate exams.

Are your wives that clingy?

Oh, yeah.
My wife just bought golf clubs

so she could ruin golf for me.

My wife's outside waiting
in the minivan.

Yeah, even I have to get away
from Heidi every now and then.

Do you know what
the worst "wife" thing is?

When you forget to ask them,
"How was your day?"

Oh.
No, no,

the worst thing
is when you ask Alan,

"How was your day?"
and he answers.

You know, it's funny--
I-I always thought

being married to a guy
would be different.

In some ways, it is.
I mean, uh... for example,

I imagine that you guys enjoy it

when you walk in
on your wives masturbating.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah...

Oh, no!

âª Men. âª

Hey, there you are.
We didn't get to talk yesterday.

How was your day?

Oh, oh, it was the worst.

but there must have been
30 of us.

30? Wow, that's
an amazing end to that story.

I wish. You know they don't
give you bags anymore?

If you want a bag,
that's ten cents.

Ten cents.
That's outrageous.

That's six bruised peaches.

Uh, anyway, so I-I
went out to the parking lot

and there was a...
Alan, can...

can we just jump to the end?

She agreed not to press charges.

Okay, that is the end to, like,
way too many of your stories.

So, uh, how did your
foster dads group go?

I-I texted you,
but you never answered.

Really?

I... That's...
I must not have gotten it.

Are you sure? Uh, it says
it was read at 7:47.

I guess it was ignored at 7:48.

Dads group was really fun.

Yeah, I think it's gonna be
really gonna helpful for Louis.

Oh, great, great. Uh, when
are you gonna do it again?

Uh... Well, you know,
I was gonna actually

have the guys over tonight.

Tonight? The place is a mess.

And The Good Wife is on.

Mmm.

Well, I do want to meet
the guys, though.

Oh. Well, you know, it's a...
it's actually, it's a pretty

tight-knit group, so...

I don't think people
will be able to open up

if there's a stranger around.
Besides, don't...

don't you and Ms. McMartin
have a thing tonight?

Nope. Uh-uh.
Free as a boner in sweat pants.

No. Come on.

You deserve a thing, so...

here.

Well, I-I do deserve a thing.

Hey, hey--
you only give me money

when you're trying
to get rid of me.

No, I don't.
Here, take more money.

Wait, hold on.
Do you...

do you not want me
around tonight?

No, it's just... it's just...

I had fun last night,

and I want to have fun
again tonight.

I see. And Webster's
defines fun as having

or pertaining to
the absence of Alan.

From the Latin:
hurticus feelingsmus.

Okay, are you really asking
why I don't want you around

while you're talking like that?

Oh, so you really
don't want me around?

Yes, or as defined
in Webster's, affirmative.

Don't take my dictionary thing.
Well,

at least you have a thing.

I don't have anything
for myself.

I mean, every time
I turn around, there you are.

Oh, what? Let's just do it.
Look, oh, there you are.

Well, I'm sorry
if my presence offends you.

If bags weren't
ten cents apiece,

I'd put one over my head.

Listen, I just want
one thing for myself.

One thing where
you're not around.

Is that too much to ask?

Fine. If that's
how you feel, you know,

have your stupid little group
all to yourself in our house.

But don't expect me to wait
to watch The Good Wife.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

And here's a picture of Heidi
on a nude beach in CancÃºn.

Whoa. I can
see her can.

And her cÃºn.

Alan?

I thought you had a thing.

Well, if you saw my feet
after the paraffin dip,

you'd know I already
had my thing.

Don't worry, I won't spoil
your little party.

You must be the dads
who are part of the group.

I'm the dad who's
not part of the group.

And here we go.

Hey, hey, why don't...
why don't you have a beer?

Oh, no, I'll be in my room.
I can amuse myself.

I have a half bag
of Cheetos and a radio.

Oh, hey, hey, come on, man.

No. Please stay.

Well, when the boss says jump,
I say how... Hi. I'm Alan.

Wow, what a fun way
to meet someone.

Here you go.
There you go.

Oh. Thank you, thank you.
So, uh, so what's going on?

Or-Or should I say whassup?!

You remember
that?

You guys... You guys
remember that? Remember?

Whassup?!

That is the whitest guy
I have ever seen.

Wait, wait, is that
all you're serving?

Chips? Not even
in a bowl?

You should be embarrassed.

Oh, trust me, I'm embarrassed.

Look, nobody cares.

Alan seems to care,
and you care

about Alan's feelings,
don't you?

Ooh, I like him.
Two points for the silver fox.

Maybe I'll just, uh,
throw together some nachos.

We're fine. The...
Hey, I don't want you

to go to all the trouble.
See? I'm thinking about you.

It's no trouble.
It's just, uh, chips, uh...

guacamole, uh,
jalapeÃ±os and, uh, queso fresco.

My wife's idea
of nachos

is just dumping
some salsa on chips.

Well, I'm nacho
average wife.

âª Men. âª

So this guy--
I bail him out completely,

agree to marry him,

and guess what we do
on our wedding night.

I-I don't need to hear that.
No judgment.

Nothing.
We came straight home.

Same place we went
on our honeymoon.

The guy has a jet.
How hard is it to go to Aruba?

Jamaica.

âª Ooh, I wanna take you âª

âª To Bermuda âª

âª Bahama, come on,
pretty mama âª

âª Key Largo, Montego âª

âª Baby, why don't we go âª

âª Ooh, I want to take you
down to Kokomo âª

âª We'll get there fast âª

âª And then we'll take it slow âª

âª That's where we want to go âª

âª Way down in Kokomo âª

âª Martinique âª

âª That Monserrat mystique. âª

That is my jam,

and y'all are my bitches.

âª Men. âª

What the hell are you doing?

I'm just being a fun guy.
What are you doing?

You're about as much fun
as the polyp in Rick's colon.

You're doing exactly what
I thought you would.

You're taking
my friends.

Just like you
take everything.

You took my house,
you took my money,

you even took my old jeans
and turned 'em into cutoffs.

They're called jorts,
and they look great on me.

Okay, you knew I didn't
want you here

and you said you
weren't gonna be here,

yet here you are

with your...
guacamole

and your fresco queso.

It's queso fresco.

You do not correct me
when I'm mocking you.

You know what? You know what?
I think...

I think that the reason
that you didn't want me here

is because you were afraid

that they were gonna
like me better than you.

Okay, I can honestly
say that I have never

had that thought
in my life.

Everything
okay in here?

Well, am I allowed

to answer your
friends, Walden?

I'm sorry you guys
had to see this.

Oh, come on,
we've all been there.

I mean, just a while back,
Jack's wife chased him

around his house
with a steak knife.

Trust me, I was
in no danger.

She couldn't use a kitchen
utensil to save her life.

We can help you
work though this.

That's what
the group is for.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,

hey, why don't we
do some role playing?

Okay, you're...
you're, uh, Alan,

and you just
found out that Walden

doesn't want you
around his friends.

Fine. Thank
you, Walden,

for letting me live
here rent-free.

Despite not contributing
anything to this household,

I ignore even your
most basic requests.

Um...
You're not really supposed to use this

to attack.
Wait,

hold on. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

I'm Walden, and I get off

on making Alan
feel bad about himself.

Well, I'm Alan, and I
get off on everything.

Including the
stock photos

that come from the picture
frames from Target.

That was one time.
The Internet was down,

and-and she reminded me
of a girl I knew in high school.

Yeah, we've all been there.
Sears catalog.

Neiman Marcus.

The Indian girl
from the Land O'Lakes box.

Okay, you know what, I'm sick
of having the same fight

over and over again.

You know, why do we
keep doing this?

'Cause you love him
and he loves you.

Also, where am I?

Oh, hey, Brian, I know you've
been asleep for a few meetings,

but Walden told us
they're not actually gay.

I know they're not gay.
I said they love each other.

It's the only thing
that can explain

why they make
each other so crazy.

You chose to adopt this kid
together for a reason.

Why don't you talk about that?

Oh, God, my wife
said the twins are sick.

I got to go.

Back to sleep.

By the way,
not cool about my sister.

No judgment?

I'm Alan.

And I'm always there for Walden
whenever he needs me the most.

And I do look good in jorts.

And my nachos
are restaurant quality.

Well, I'm Walden, and, uh,

I've been the best friend
that Alan's ever had.

And also,

I'm not angry about the 20s

he occasionally steals
from my wallet.

I'm sorry I said
I didn't want you around.

I'm sorry I was smothering you.

Oh... Bring it in.
I'm s...

Come on.

Hey, hey...

You know where we should go?

âª Bermuda, Bahama âª

âª Come on, pretty mama âª

âª To Key Largo, Montego,
baby why don't we go? âª

Wait, are you really taking me to...
No.

âª The Florida Keys,
there's a place called Koko... âª

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª
I just want to tell you guys,

I love being
a part of this group.

And we love
having you, Alan.

Oh, well, thank you.
So, as I was saying,

why is it that
I'm willing to take

three hours to make him dinner

and he won't take three seconds
to tell me what he wants?

Speaking of three seconds,
can we talk about the sex?

At least you're
having sex, sister.

.......... ********** ..........

âª Men. âª

Okay, here it is.

This is Louis' first
science fair project.

You're gonna love it.

Wow.

Louis made this all by himself.

Last time I was here,

he got the straw from his
juice box stuck in his nose.

He also got it unstuck.

Uh, check it out.

So, uh, so we'll take
a piece of bread, all right?

Put it in the mouth,

where the saliva will
start to dissolve the bread.

And then it'll travel
down to the stomach,

where the acids will break down
the complex carbohydrates.

At which point it will
move past the appendix,

which does nothing.

Yeah, we should rename
that the Alan.

Uh, and then it'll go
to the small intestines,

the large intestines,
where finally...

Oh, dear God.

Uh, no, it's okay,
it's a Hershey's Kiss.

Okay.

So the reason I came
over is to tell you--

we are ready to start
the final steps

for you to officially
adopt Louis.

Oh, my God, I'm gonna
Hershey's Kiss my pants.

But before the
adoption is final,

I want you to tell Louis
you two aren't gay.

Are you sure that this is
the best time to do that?

I mean, I haven't even
talked to him

about the birds
and the bees,

let alone the bees
and the bees.

I know there is never
a perfect time

to tell your son his two dads
aren't gay...

...but it'll be more harmful
the longer you wait.

Yeah, but it's just,
like, h-how do I tell him?

Um, does Hallmark make
a "Sorry, son,

it turns out
I'm straight" card?

You've been a fantastic father
so far.

I am confident
you will handle this

with the utmost attention
and care.

Walden?

Him I'm worried about.

Sorry I'm late.

Uh, I took Louis
to the mall

to get him some
new school clothes.

He's trying them on
right now.

Plus there was a new kiosk
that will bedazzle anything.

Got an iPhone case for my boo.

Now, I'm gonna bedazzle
your cheek with some sugar.

Alan, as your social worker,
I cannot accept gifts.

And as your "boo,"
hell no.

I can't believe
I'm just realizing this,

but the perfect person
to date a social worker

is a needy child.

We were just discussing
that it would be

in the best interest
of Louis to tell him

you two aren't actually gay.

Oh, I agree
100 percent.

I mean, it's not like anyone was
buying either one of us

as a gay man anyway.

Ooh, that top is
fierce, girl. Rawr.

Louis, could you come
in here for a second?

Oh, oh, we're doing
it right now?

It will be such a relief
to discontinue this charade.

What are you wearing?

Alan says between business
casual and country club chic.

Now turn around.

He's "bedazzle-ous."

Okay, should we
tell him now?

I don't think
he's gonna believe us.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

âª Men. âª

Oh, hey, Berta.

I talked to Louis.

He said you guys told him
you're not gay.

Yeah, we didn't want
to lie to him anymore.

So now you're just
lying to yourself.

Lyndsey?

Hi, Alan. Can we talk?
Sure, come on in.

Uh, can I give you
a hand with your box?

Boy, I haven't said that
to you in a while.

I'll say to you now
what I said to you then.

It's easier
if I just do it myself.

I was cleaning out
my house,

and I found some
of your old things.

Oh, look at
this stuff.

Oh, here's a picture from
our Caribbean vacation.

Oh, remember how I got
stung by that jellyfish?

Of course I do-- you made me pee
on you to neutralize the pain.

Seems like you got stung
a lot on that vacation.

Did I?

Wow!

Oh, look.

Wow, my old boom box.

Oh, and it still has that
mix CD I made for us.

"Now That's What I Call
Nasty, Volume 69."

âª A little bit of Mary âª

Ah!
âª All night long âª

âª A little bit of Jessica,
here I am âª

âª A little bit of you
makes me your man... âª

"Mambo No. 5."

How did I ever let you
make love to me

while you sang
other women's names?

Be fair, you used to
scream other guys' names.

Anyway, I didn't come by
just to bring you your stuff.

I also wanted to tell you
that I've decided to move away.

Get a fresh start.

What?

Uh, wh-where's
this coming from?

I've been thinking about it
for a while,

and there's nothing for me here.

I mean, most of my memories
involve a time

when I was drinking
really heavily,

and those aren't pretty.

I mean, the bar
by my house has a drink

called "The Lyndsey Special."

It's a bottle of Merlot,
a shot of vodka

and a scrunchie to hold your
hair back while you throw up.

So where do you think
you're gonna go?

Well, I have family
in Arizona, so...

not there.

Ah, you know, I just,
I can't believe it.

I mean, well, I hope you don't
forget about me completely.

You're a hard person
to forget, Alan Harper.

I've tried.

Hence, "The Lyndsey Special."

Mm.

Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know.

This is gonna
be so strange.

I mean, even when
we weren't together,

it was nice knowing
you were nearby.

Ah, I know what you mean.

Well, this is it.

Good-bye, Alan.

Good-bye, Lyndsey.

Are we really not gonna talk
about the 20 bucks you owe me?

I am really
gonna miss you.

I'll miss you, too.

Let's go
to your room.

Okay, great.

Ow!
What's wrong?

I just got stung by a jellyfish
earlier, that's all.

âª Men. âª

âª ...Jessica, here I am âª

âª A little bit of you
makes me your... âª

Yeah, still got it.

Sex is very different
when you're sober.

Now I really know
how long two minutes is.

It was a special occasion.

I wanted to give you
a little something extra.

Well, thank you.

This puts a nice cap
on our relationship.

Wait.

I can't have this be
the last time we make love.

The last time I put
on your panties.

The last time you say,
"No, not there,"

and I pretend
I was just confused.

Look, I'm not saying
I won't miss you,

but the fact is
you're married.

You're about to adopt a child.

That's my point.

The adoption is almost final,
and when it is,

Walden and I will get a divorce.

And I misspelled my name
on the prenup.

We'll live like kings.

Are you really
asking me to stay?

Yes, I mean, we've shared
so much over the years.

We can't just
throw it away like a...

a long-running hit
television show

that still pulls in
a pretty decent audience.

I suppose it is something
to think about.

I mean, for the first time
in a long time,

neither one of us
is seeing anybody else.

Hey, do you need a
bedazzled iPhone case?

Wait, are you
seeing someone?

Yeah, yeah,
Alan Harper has two girlfriends.

What else do I have?

Good credit? Health insurance?

A job?

This is a lot
to think about.

I'm gonna need
some time.

Of course,
take all the time you need.

Okay.

Look, I really do
need to go.

And I really do need
my panties back.

Oh.

âª Men. âª

Hey, Walden.

Lyndsey?

Uh, are you coming out
of Alan's room?

Uh-huh.

You drinking again?

Do I need to take you
to a meeting?

No, still sober.

But I should apologize
for sleeping with your husband.

Not the first time
I've said that.

See ya.

So, okay.

Alan!

Yeah?

Are you having sex with Lyndsey

while you're sleeping
with our social worker?

Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.

No, it's not!

Look, look, this thing
with Lyndsey just happened.

A-And, honestly,
I-I'm glad it did.

I-I really want her
to give us another shot.

Wh about Ms. McMartin?!

Oh, we're not
that serious.

Plus, she doesn't get me
like Lyndsey gets me.

When I try to put
Ms. McMartin's panties on,

she looks at me like
I'm some kind of weirdo.

Kind of like how I'm looking
at you right now?!

Look, I'm gonna see
Ms. McMartin tonight,

and I-I'll tell her
it's over.

She's gonna be upset--
nobody likes getting dumped.

Oh, she'll be fine.

I mean, you've seen
how she looks at me.

That's not love.

That's not even like.

That's-- if we run
into anyone I know,

I'm pretending that
you're my slow brother.

Alan?
Mm-hmm.

I want you to get your penis
out of my business.

Change "business"
to "turkey,"

uh, and it's the story

of how a 13-year-old boy named
Alan ruined Thanksgiving.

âª Men. âª

What looks good?

And don't say
my boobs.

Cute.

Funny.

Boobs.

Um, can we talk?

What's wrong?

Is it the restaurant?

It's not
too pricy, is it?

It only had
one dollar sign on Yelp.

N-N-No, it's not that.

Um, although,
$14 for tilapia?

Sounds to me like a
beer-battered rip-off.

Then what's going on?

Here's the thing.

I really like you,
it's just that...

Oh, my God, are you
breaking up with me?

Wow, Band-Aid off.

Seriously?

You?

Breaking up with me?

That?

Breaking up with this?

Hey, hey, there's
no need to point.

I mean we both could
be in better shape.

Oh, there is only one person
at this table wearing Spanx,

and it is not me.

Could you keep it down?
People are starting to look.

Oh, well, they're
probably wondering

why the old man
and his nurse are arguing.

Hey, I am not that
much older than you.

I'm 47.

Great, you just lost
me my senior discount.

I knew dating you
was a bad idea.

Yes, exactly.

Louis and Walden are
the priority here.

You and I should never have
complicated the adoption

with our unbridled
passion.

We should
have bridled.

This was so stupid.

I am so stupid.

No, you're not stupid.

You just let your unfettered
desire get the best of you.

You should have fettered.

You know what?

You're right.

Ending this is
a good thing.

To be honest, I'm actually
a little relieved.

Of course you are, you
just dodged a bullet--

a cheap, middle-aged,
lactose-intolerant bullet.

âª Men. âª

What is going on?

I have no idea.

Surprise!

It's inspection time!

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Look at these sharp corners
on this table.

No gate on the stairs.

I see a lot of problems here.

A lot of
problems.

A lot of problems.

Believe me,
I see the same problem.

And I would like to help you
get rid of your problem,

even if that means dumping
the problem's body in the ocean.

If you think it's hard
getting me out of here alive,

try getting rid
of my ghost.

Okay, obviously
this is not about the adoption.

This is about us.

Now, why don't we just
sit down and talk?

Look at this.

A weapon in the form of a toy?

Is it loaded?

Yes, it is!

You have to be careful.

You might hurt someone
you thought you cared about

but were horribly deceived by.

Okay, listen,

I understand
that you are very upset.

And I agree

that we should take this
out on Alan.

Your railings on the
deck are too low,

there's no safety
glass on the fireplace

and you have
alcohol

within a child's reach.

We can, we can fix this.

See? All gone.

Ugh..

What kind of wine is that?

Oh, uh, uh,
it's instant.

It comes in a packet.

Just add water.

Uh, it's-it's like
astronaut wine.

And you're upset that
this guy broke up with you?

The only thing
I'm upset about

is the litany of violations
I found here tonight.

You have 48 hours
to address these issues.

Keep in mind:

I can stop by anytime I see fit.

Anytime.

Okay, say what you will,

but that exit was cool.

Okay, you think she's angry now?

What do you think
is gonna happen

when she finds out
about you and Lyndsey?

Oh, oh, don't worry,
I'll apologize to Ms. McMartin,

and then tomorrow, when I'm
having lunch with Lyndsey,

I'll tell her we have to lay low

until the adoption
goes through.

No. I don't want you going

anywhere near Ms. McMartin.

But I think I can help...
No!

You've already done
enough damage.

And I'm warning you,
you stay away.

I am a billionaire

and I can buy my way out
of at least one murder.

This is still America.

âª Men. âª

So, what looks good?

And don't say my boobs.

Why would I say "my boobs"

when it's your boobs
that I like?

Have you thought about us?

Yes.

I want to give it a try.

Oh, you do?!

Oh, that is so great.
I know!

The rest of our life together
starts right now.

Yes!

Or in three weeks, when
I can see you again.

What?

Oh, well, Walden is worried

about the adoption.

He doesn't want there to be
any complications.

So he thinks I'll screw it up?

No, he thinks
I'll screw it up.

Oh, sure.

So I just think
it's better if we lay low

until after the court date.

I understand.

Is that why we drove
an hour away from the ocean

to go to a seafood restaurant?

Ah, that and...

no corkage fee.

Ooh.

A Pinot.

Oh! Oh, you don't mind
if I drink, do you?

I can honestly say
I've never been less tempted.

Good legs...

mmm, full body...

goes down easy.

They should call this
"The Lyndsey Special."

Cute.

You know, I-I certainly
wouldn't want to do anything

to jeopardize the adoption.

And taking it slow
is probably better for us, too.

Oh! Lyndsey plus Alan
equals "us."

Aw...

Hello, Alan.

Good God!

What-what are
you doing here?

And-and how do you keep making
these dramatic entrances?

Who is this?

Oh. Uh, Th-this
is-is Lyndsey.

Uh, Lyndsey, this
is Ms. McMartin,

our social
worker.

Uh, remember, I told you
about her and the adoption?

Um, uh, Lyndsey
is my cousin,

um, from Cedar
Rapids, Iowa.

What?

So you make out
with your cousin?

I said she
was from Iowa.

Is this why you
broke up with me?

For her?

Hold on.

You're dating
your social worker?

He was.

Till he dumped me last night.

Was it just
last night?

You said
you were single.

Did I say I was single?

Yeah.
Right after we had sex.

Did we have sex?

You had sex with her?

Did I have
sex with her?

You jackass!

Heh.

Chicks.

Crazy in the head,
crazy in the bed, am I right?

Oh, Lyndsey... Lyndsey, wait!

I banged both of them.

Ain't no thang.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Oh, hey, did you, uh,
see Lyndsey?

Uh, yes, I did.

Uh, and she was totally cool
with taking it slow

until the adoption is done.

Good. And thank you.

Yeah, you may not want
to thank me just yet.

Um...

Please tell me that
that is your blood

and not powdered wine.

I-It's not my fault.

Ms. McMartin showed up.
What?

She followed me.
She's gone crazy.

No, she hasn't "gone crazy."

You drove her crazy.

You make people crazy!

That-that's a little unfair.

I mean,
I grant you that, you know,

maybe it was a mistake
to sleep with her,

but when a woman has five cats,

she doesn't have
to be "made crazy."

You know what? You're right.

This-this-this is my fault.

I'm the one
who made the mistake.

You are?
Yes.

I mistakenly thought
that you were

a capable,
competent human being,

able to handle
a simple situation

without destroying
the life of everyone around you.

Boy, if I had a dollar

for every time
someone has said that to me.

But seriously, seriously,
I-I will fix this.

Oh. Great.

You're gonna fix this.
Yeah.

I mean, why was I worried?

Have no fear!

Alan is here!

Hey! Hey, everyone!

Don't worry!

Alan's gonna fix it!

Sailors at sea,

throw away your life vests!

You don't need them!

'Cause Alan is gonna
fix everything!

Maybe I do make people crazy.

âª Men. âª

Walden?
What are you doing here?

I am on the
"Alan Harper Apology Tour."

Uh, but this is gonna require

a little bit of
audience participation.

When I say "Alan,"
you say "idiot."

Alan.
Idiot.

Alan.
Idiot.

This is fun. Come in.

Wow, this is nice.

And it doesn't smell
like cat urine at all.

So what do you want, Walden?

I realize that Alan--

Idiot.

Look, I-I realize that
he can do some stupid things.

And I'm-I'm sure you've seen
his helicopter dance,

where he uses his penis
as the propeller.

Actually, I haven't.

Neither have I.

I realize how angry
you must be with him.

But that has nothing to do

with the kind of father
I can be to Louis.

I know that.

It's just that Alan--

Idiot.

Ha!

He makes me crazy.

I-I just said that!

In-in fact, I hit a lifeguard

with a patio chair saying that.

Look, Walden,
at the end of the day,

I'm not gonna let my anger
prevent a child

from being placed
in a good home.

Thank God.

I just... I've never realized

how much another person
can mean to me.

That is so sweet.

Why can't anybody

ever think that about me?

I am such
a loser!

No, you're not a loser,
Ms. McMartin.

Yes, I am!

I thought I hit rock bottom

by dating an old guy
who can't get a boner.

It turns out, rock bottom
is getting dumped

by the old guy
who can't get a boner.

What is wrong with me?

Nothing.

Come on, you're smart
and you're fun...

And, oh, by the way,

you are way too pretty for Alan.

Oh.

So are you.

See?

Now there's that smile.

Come on,
now, now...

any guy would be lucky
to be with you.

Oh, you're just saying that.

No, you're awesome.

And what you do for a living,
helping those kids,

changing their lives,

putting your hand
on my leg...

Wow.

I can't believe this.

You're not
the only one.

I don't want you to worry.

I'm not going to let the fact

that we are in a relationship
affect Louis.

Learned that lesson, am I right?

Yeah.

Relationship.

Okay.

I am going to go...
Where?

Where are you going?

To the bathroom.

Oh, okay.

Hurry back.

I'll miss you.

I'll miss you, too.

Ooh, it's a little
chilly out there.

I'm gonna
grab my pants.

And my car keys.

Sex is so much better
with someone you know well.

Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

That's why so many
marriages last forever.

But it's true, it's true--
sex is better when you,

you know, you know the
other person's rhythms,

what they like,

which leg they can
put behind their head.

I'm still impressed
you can do that.

Uh, yoga.

When I started, I was
single and I wanted to be

flexible enough to
give myself a...

You know, I, uh, I-I really
would have missed you

if you moved to
San Francisco.

Aw, me, too.

Although maybe I should have
waited to sell the house.

I got to be out of here in two weeks.
Mm.

I could help you
find an apartment.

Unless you want me to
stay out of your hair.

Hey, that's the second
time I said that tonight.

Actually, I really
could use your help.

I mean, unless
you're busy with work.

Oh, I love you, Lyndsey.

I love you, too, Alan.

You want to go again?
No.

You satisfied me
the first time.

âª Men. âª

Walden, do you
believe in destiny?

I believe in

Destiny's Child.

I'm serious.

Think of everything
that happened

that led us to this moment.

Oh, see, that...
I'd rather not.

I know you don't want to talk
about my relationship with Alan.

No, I don't.
I don't even like

sharing a cab with Alan.

But don't you see? If Alan
and I hadn't been together

and I hadn't freaked out
when he rejected me,

you wouldn't be here
to comfort me.

In a way, I just want to say

thank you, Alan Harper.

Yeah.

Thank you, Alan Harper.

So-So you are
aware that you...

...freaked out a little bit.

You mean when I showed up
to your house at midnight

in the rain or when I followed
Alan for 12 straight hours

and peed in a bottle
in my car?

I didn't know you
did that. That's...

Look at us, getting
to know each other.

So-So was that

out of character for
you, would you say?

Well, I admit, I am not
good with rejection.

Who is?

Well, don't worry.

I am never, ever
gonna let go of you.

I believe you.

I'll let you know when I'm done.

Okay, once again,

I will buy you another

We don't have to wait
for that one to come out.

Hey.

Oh, you always know
when I've had sex.

What gave it away?

The bounce in my step
or the glow in my cheek?

No, it's probably the, uh, text

I got from you that said,

"Guess why I can't see
my penis right now."

I was bored.

So, uh, how was your little
talk with Ms. McMartin?

You know, about that whole
situation-- you and her--

I just... you know, maybe
I just judged you too harshly.

No, no, I was... I deserved it.
I-I was stupid and weak.

And besides, bitch be crazy.

Yeah. Well...

bitch be my girlfriend.

Oh, my God.
You didn't.

After all the crap
you gave me?

"How could you sleep
with our social worker, Alan?"

"Get your penis
out of my business, Alan."

"That's not what yoga
is for, Alan."

Okay, fine, I admit it.
I-I made a mistake.

I just... I Alan'd
this whole thing up.

My name as a verb. I like it.

So-So how did this happen?

I don't know. I just...
I went over there and then...

she got all emotional

and kept calling herself
a loser and then...

Okay, and then
she started to cry.

Oh, crying. She used that
to turn me on, too.

What? No. I-I comforted her

and then one thing led to an...
You're a freak.

Hey, hey, don't call me a freak.

You're the one who Alan'd it up.

You know what,
maybe it'll be okay.

I mean, she only goes crazy
when she gets rejected,

so I just have to keep her
happy for a couple days

until we finalize
Louis's adoption.

See, I just...

I feel bad, 'cause...

I mean, she already fell
head over heels in love with me.

She Walden'd you.

You know what?

Go Alan yourself.

Thanks to yoga, I can.

âª Men. âª

This is great.

Lots of natural light,
hardwood floors,

and it's next to a Chipotle6

I can't wait for our first
post-booty burrito.

It's also right
across the street

from a really
cute bookstore.

Remember books?

And-and you saw how
big those closets are.

I could live
in those things.

Not a good idea.

I already have
enough people asking me

if you're in
the closet.

People think I'm gay?

That's hilarious.

Can't wait to tell my husband.

So... do you
really like it?

What's not to like?

This place is amazing.

Good. 'Cause I was thinking

maybe instead of visiting,

why don't you
move in with me?

In this dump?

You just said
you liked it.

That was when I thought
it was for you.

But for the two of us?

There's no study.

Where would I write my novel?

You're writing
a novel?

Well, when I finish
my screenplay.

Do you not want
to live with me?

No, of course I do.

But I-I want our place
to be perfect.

Like you.

Uh, and I don't care how long
it takes to find it.

You have two weeks.

Two weeks?

That's-that's plenty of time
to find an apartment

Vampire Hunter.

âª Men. âª

There you are!

Hi!

There you are!

In my kitchen.

Holding a knife.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I wanted to surprise you.

Well, I peed a little, so...

good job.

Wh-Who...
How did you get in here?

Berta.

I told her
I was cooking for you.

She said, "Great.
Clean the toilets, too."

Then she grabbed a six-pack
and she went home.

So it's just me and you.

There's no witnesses.

You are so funny.

It's like dating
Jimmy Fallon.

I'm making you
crab cakes.

What...? Really?
I love crab cakes.

I know.

You told me the happiest summer
you ever had

was when your family
rented that house in Maryland

and your grandpa
took you crabbing.

I remember when we were there
and he said,

"You know, when you turn 18,
I'm gonna take you to Vegas

and we'll get
a different kind of crabs."

Ah, yeah.

Then he laughed.

Oh, how Boompa
loved his hookers.

Hey, this is very nice,
but maybe next time...

Oh! I also have
your favorite dessert.

Did I tell you
about Gam-Gam's apple pie?

That's not Gam-Gam's pie.

âª Men. âª

Hey.

Oh, hey.
Where you been?

Apartment hunting.

Are you... Really?

Oh, my God,
you do hear my prayers.

Don't get excited.

It was for Lyndsey.

Oh. Damn you.

But get this: She asked me
to move in with her.

All right, you got me.

There's no way I'm doing it.

Ah, you're dead to me!

So, uh, how's it going
with Ms. McCrazy?

You know what?
That'll be enough of that.

Oh, sorry.

She might be listening.

No, I'm just...

Seriously, Ms. McMartin is
a genuinely nice person.

I just...

I feel bad about, like,
stringing her along.

Yeah, but you can't
break up with her.

It'll jeopardize the adoption.

I know, but, like, lying to her

just seems cowardly and selfish.

Well, you know what they say.

One man's cowardly and selfish

is another man's approach
to everything in life.

No, you know what?

She didn't take Louis away

when she found out
our marriage was fake.

And she didn't take him away
when you dumped her, so...

Like, she's gonna do
the right thing.

So am I.

Good for you.

You make me want to be
a better man.

Hey, uh, i-is Louis home?

No, he's staying
at a friend's house.

Good. I can watch porn
without headphones.

Oh, I get it now.

I'm in hell.

âª Men. âª

Come on, baby.

Get off that laptop and
get on top of this lap.

I'm trying to find us
a place to live.

Oh! How about this one?

It's got a community hot tub.

Yes, that's great.

Uh, because when
I'm stuck in traffic,

uh, and I look at the
stranger in the next car

and he's picking his nose,
I'm always thinking,

"Boy, I'd like to sit in
stagnant water with that guy."

Okay, no hot tub.

Hey, how about
a two-bedroom loft downtown?

It's got a washer
and dryer.

And no green space
for my herb garden.

Do you even know me?

Okay.

Describe your perfect place.

Uh, it's a
beautiful home,

it's on the beach,

it has a housekeeper

and it's owned
by a billionaire

who doesn't monitor
his change jar.

You're just describing
this house.

Wow, you're right.

That worked out.
Let's have sex.

Alan...

I've made a lot of
changes in my life

and I was excited about
starting all over with you,

but I cannot go through
this same pattern

over and over again.

You love this house
more than you love me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Was that a question?

Good-bye, Alan.

Oh, come...
This is so unfair.

Until you went to
rehab last month,

you loved vodka
more than me.

And when I've had
too much house,

I don't get naked
in the Walmart.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Oh, hey, uh, Berta.

When Ms. McMartin gets here,
can you give us some privacy?

I gotta talk to her.

Oh, God.

When are you gonna stop
proposing to all these women?

Zoey, Kate...

Alan.
Uh...

actually, I'm gonna
break up with her.

If you want, I can pull
together a breakup kit

like I used to do for Charlie.

It's a pint of Haagen Dazs,

a bottle of wine

and the only copy
of your sex tapes.

Hey, Walden.

Hey, Berta!

What's your favorite flavor
of ice cream?

Why?

No reason.

Hey, thanks for coming.

Why are you with me?

Good, good. How are you?

Are you with me
because you're afraid

if you break up with me,
I'll screw up the adoption?

What?!

No!

Come... I just, uh...

Berta, how we coming
with that ice cream?

Please be honest with me.

Okay, to be honest...

yeah, I did think that.

But then I realized
that you would never

ever do something like that.

I was doing that.

I knew it!

This morning,
I was going over your paperwork,

and I literally considered
postponing the final hearing

because I was afraid,
as soon as it happened,

you would leave me.

I would never do that to you.

I was gonna break up
with you right now.

So, you agree.

We shouldn't see
each other anymore.

Here.

What's this?

It's the final adoption forms.

You have a court date tomorrow

and everything's
gonna sail through.

Congratulations.
Louis is yours.

Oh, really?

Oh... oh, my God, thank you.

Ah, you know this is a

"thank you for being
a great social worker" hug,

not a "I want you back" hug.

Yeah, I know.

And don't worry, I'm
not gonna go all crazy

and freak out on you.

Come on, I know that.

I froze your sperm.

âª Men. âª

Okay, buddy, here we go.
This is the first time

we're walking into this house
as an official family.

Cool.

Walden Schmidt, Louis Schmidt

and a big pile of Schmidt.

Ah!

Hey, you know, now
that you're my son,

someday all of this
is gonna be yours.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

So, what should we do
to celebrate

this special family day?

I'm going to play
Legos in my room!

Oh, oh, uh, you mean,

"I'm going to play
Legos in my room, Dad."

I'm going home to get high.

I mean, I'm going home
to get high...

Dad.

Seriously, I'm happy for you.

And I want you to know I'm,
I'm here whenever you need me.

Alan, you're not
getting the house.

Damn it!

This is weird.

Feel like I should be
doing something dad-like.

Like drinking beers outside.

Or grilling something.

You know, something manly.

Oh, perfect!

Uh, I have a nice, thick

Portobello mushroom
you can grill.

I said "something manly."

Well, if you close your eyes,
you'll swear you have

a piece of meat in your mouth.

I'm never closing my eyes again.

Just give me a beer.

So, uh, how's it going
with Ms. McMartin?

She seemed a little standoffish
at the courthouse.

You know, I think
she was just trying

to keep things professional.

There's nothing going on
between us anymore.

Guess it doesn't matter.

We always knew it would
end up like this.

Just you and me.

Couple of cool bros,

couple of chilled brews...

and a couple of grilled 'bellos.

Stop trying to shove
your mushrooms down my throat!

My point is we don't need
anything else to be happy.

Or anyone.

Right, right!

Let Lyndsey move
to San Francisco.

There's no way I'm giving up
all this for her!

I mean, look at this house!

Look at the ocean and the view!

That's why you broke up?

You had a choice between Lyndsey

and this house,

and you chose this house?

Yep.

Okay, you gave up a relationship
with a woman who knows

everything about you
and still wants to be with you

because you didn't want
to leave this house?

Yep.

Okay, as I'm saying
this out loud,

you are realizing what
a moron you are, aren't you?

Yep.

But-but I'm not the only one.

Ms. McMartin is perfect for you.

Come on, you're the one
who said she was crazy.

Yes, yes, but when you really
look at it, what has she done?

I mean, she fell in love
too quickly... like you.

She only wants
what's best for Louis...

like you.

She's inexplicably
drawn to me...

like you.

She did surprise me by cooking
my favorite meal naked.

Sadly, like you.

I mean, at least I-I traded
Lyndsey for a house.

What did you trade
Ms. McMartin for?

Nothing.

It's worse!

I traded her for you!

Oh, my God! We're idiots!

I know. We're gonna die alone!

Worse! We're gonna die
with each other!

Go to Ms. McMartin!

I will! Go to Lyndsey!

I will! I love you!

Oh, not the right time.
Knew that.

âª Men. âª

There you are.

Walden?

Surprise.

Oh, I'm so sorry!

I thought you were an intruder.

But how did you get
in my apartment?

Well, I was gonna, um...

rent the vacant apartment
above you,

and then rappel
down the building

and smash through the window,
like Bruce Willis in Die Hard.

But then I just looked
under your mat,

and I found your spare key.

Oh! That's for my cat psychic.

Wha...? Your what?

What do you want?

I-I remembered
that your favorite meal was

pan-seared salmon
with orange miso glaze.

Oh, my God,
you made that for me?

No. Uh, I made...

uh, grilled cheese since it's

the only thing
I know how to make.

But the important thing
is I remembered.

Well, that's very sweet.

But... why?

I wanted to give us
another chance.

Oh... oh, I don't know,
Walden...

B-Before you say anything else,
just... listen to this.

âª When a man âª

âª Men. âª

Hi. Uh, my girlfriend is about
to leave for San Francisco,

and I need a ticket
on the 7:35 flight.

Unfortunately,
there's only one seat left,

and that's in first class.

Oh, how much is it?
$1,100.

Oh, go to hell!

I'm sorry, that was not,
uh, directed at you.

Uh, you know what,
uh, uh, Karen?

Uh, is it possible
that someone

who already has a coach seat

could be bumped for some reason?

Or...

say, if I give you...

ten reasons?

And you give me
five reasons back?

Sir, I cannot accept a bribe.

And I certainly cannot
give you change for a bribe.

You don't understand
how important it is

for me to get this ticket!

I will do anything.

Anything.

Perhaps Karen wants

to get her groove back?

There is one thing you can do.

Name it.

You can give me $1,100.

I just... I just need
to get to that gate

before my girlfriend
boards that plane.

I-I need to tell her
that-that I-I love her

and I was wrong and I want
to spend my life with her.

I'm sorry, you should've
mentioned that before.

We have a special fare
for big romantic gestures.

And it's $1,100.

Fine.

I'll go.

Karen: 1,100.

Love: zero.

âª When a man loves a woman âª

Bolton.

You know any BublÃ©?

God, no.

Okay, we're done here.

What are you looking at?

Get the hell
out of here, Bolton!

Fine.

I gave up singing
the national anthem

at the Lakers game for this.

So, what do you say?

Will you give us another chance?

Walden, this is kind of

I dumped you, and now
you want to be with me

because you want
what you can't have.

Oh, God, you're so smart.
Let's make out.

I'm serious.

Well, so am I!

Come on, you're kind
and you're generous.

And it... and it's cute
how you turn on the water

in the bathroom so you think
I can't hear you peeing.

Plus, we're good
in bed together.

True.

Although, after Alan,
anyone was gonna look good.

Okay, I will give you,
like, a billion dollars

if you never
bring that up again.

Look, you don't have
to give me money

when you want me to do
something-- just ask.

Why can't you be my husband?

would be kind of nice

Yes. With America.

Morning.

Oh, morning, Lyndsey.

Have you two officially met?

We have, actually.

Remember
when you were stalking Alan

and you followed him
to a restaurant

to catch him with his whore?

I was that whore!

Oh, my God.

That was you?

Yes.
You know, I remember thinking,

"What is such a beautiful
woman doing with Alan?"

I thought the same thing
about you.

"What are we doing with Alan?"

And here I was worried you two
would have nothing in common.

Care for a mimosa?
Oh, no,

thanks, I'm recently sober.
I'm cutting down

on the self-destructive choices
in my life.

Morning.

And she's down to one.

Oh!

Oh, this is so uncomfortable.
What?

Well, I'm about to have
breakfast with my current lover,

my former lover, and my husband.

Oh, my God,
I'm turning into my mother.

Well, to be fair,

your mother slept
with a lot more women.

Oh, hey, our, uh,
three-month anniversary

is on Valentine's Day.
What should we do?

I don't know. I was thinking
we could get dressed up

and put on some cologne
and get some flowers

and go to
a romantic dinner...

Ooh, I like it.

...with our girlfriends.

Our girlfriends?
But it's Valentine's Day.

I can't believe I'm in a
relationship with a married man.

Eh. By the third time,
you get used to it.

You know what,

that's actually
a really good point.

Since Louis' adoption's final,
why are we still married?

Uh, because we love each other.

See? They always promise they're
gonna get out of their marriage,

but they never do.

Alan, I want a divorce.

Wow. Just get right to it.

Happy Valentine's Day to Alan.

Oh, come on.
This was never a real marriage.

And these aren't
real tears, either.

I'm a stone-hearted
bastard, too!

You know what, Walden,
you can keep him.

All right.

I'll go get him
before I find him masturbating

in a pool of his own tears.

and the private jet?

Yep.

And you'll get that shirt.

You know what?
I'll go first.

You know, this isn't easy
for me either.

Does the beach house
and the private jet

and the billion dollars
make it easier?

Duh.

But this is still the best
relationship I've ever been in.

Hmm. It's funny.

When Judith and I got
divorced, she said,

"If you don't leave,
I will kill you."

I believed her.

Here. Your turn.

I can't. My hand
knows it's wrong.

Your hand does a lot of things
it knows is wrong.

Just sign it.

Good-bye...

Dr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.

I hardly knew ye.

Thank you. I really appreciate
you doing this whole thing.

You know, in fact, I'd like to
get you a gift to say thank you.

Well, that's very nice, but
I didn't do it for a gift.

You're my best friend, and
I would walk through fire...

What kind of a gift
are we talking about?

Whatever you want.

Don't worry about the cost.
You deserve it.

Oh, wow.

This is exciting.

You're like a genie.

What do I rub to make
my wish come true?

I heard it.

Oh. I-I already know
what my wish will be.

You can't wish for more wishes.

Damn it.

So-so what are the limits?

Are we talking
a trip to Disneyland?

More than that.

Owning Disneyland?

Less than that.

I really want to own Disneyland.

Then the Little Mermaid
can't tell me,

"Pictures with children only."

Okay, I-I know my parameters,
I just have to think about it.

Can I have a wish?

I'll give you a hint:
it's pancakes.

You know what, fine,
I'll get you pancakes.

That's how it's done.

âª Men. âª

I'm sorry, so, after living
in his guesthouse for free

for four years,
your billionaire friend

is granting you a wish?

Just one.

This is so hard.

Yeah. What do you get
for a guy who has... nothing?

No, I'm serious.

This is a very
tricky negotiation.

He'll-he'll hate me
if I ask for too much,

but I'll hate myself
if I ask for too little.

I mean...

I'll hate myself either way,
but I could be hating myself

while Michael Caine
is my butler for a day.

Shall I bring the Volvo round then, sir?

Okay. What do you have so far,
besides Michael Caine?

Well, right now there's
a range of things.

A new computer,
a real bed,

um, $10,000 to my
favorite charity...

Wow, that's very generous.

That was just in case
somebody else saw my list.

Don't you think it should be
something that lasts

for a while, something
that sets you up for the future?

Uh, number five,
penis enlargement.

Just promise me
you'll pick something practical.

Right. Right. Practical.
Got to think practical.

Hey, um, if you had
the right kind of saddle,

could you ride
a giant panda?

âª Men. âª

Don't peek.
I want it to be a surprise.

Please don't be
a panda.

Please don't be a panda.

It's not a panda.
But that would be awesome.

Can you ride a panda?

I wish. Apparently
it's animal cruelty.

PETA ruins everything.

Can I uncover my eyes?

Uh, ooh, one second.

Is he getting naked?

If he was,
I'd be covering my eyes.

Okay, open your eyes.

Wow.

What do you think?

I think he should've gotten
the penis enlargement.

This thing must
have cost a fortune.

Oh, it's not as expensive
as you think.

Plus, I traded in my Volvo.

Yeah, it paid for
his first tank of gas.

You had one wish
and this is what you asked for?

Yeah. Five people flipped me off
on the way home.

It was awesome.

Oh, plus,

you won't have to
explain your relationship

to your friends anymore.

Mmm.
They all ask,

"What are you doing with
Alan?" But nobody asks,

"What are you doing with
the guy in the Ferrari?"

Oh, wow.

Sweet ride, Walden.

Finally a car
as pretty as you are.

It's actually mine.

There is no God.

Alan, we talked
about this.

I thought you were gonna get
something practical.

I thought so, too.

But Michael Caine is out
of the country shooting a movie,

so here we are.

Couldn't you have talked
some sense into him?

I told him to get
whatever he wants.

Don't hate the genie,
hate the wish.

Right now I hate the idiot
who wasted it on a Ferrari.

Lyndsey, w-wait, wait.
We can take it for a spin.

I'll let you drive!

Not a chance.

What the hell? I really thought
she was gonna like it.

I know. Me, too.

Hey, Berta, uh, if you had
one wish, what would you get?

Have you signed the
divorce papers yet?

I did.
Then I'm good.

Men. âª

Oh.

Hey. Have you, uh,
heard from Lyndsey?

No.

I even pulled out the big guns.

I texted her a picture of
my penis with a sad face on it.

Why would that work on her

when it never worked on me?

Hey, Walden.

Alan, why did you send me
your sad penis pic?

I-I'm sorry.
That was for Lyndsey.

Come on, man!

Grow up.
She's seen it in person.

Yeah, and it was sad then, too.

Yeah, well, that sad penis

is driving around
in a brand-new Ferrari.

Why can't you talk
like a person?

Wait, so you used your wish
on a Ferrari?

And how did Lyndsey feel
about that?

Well, she hated it,
and I just don't know why.

I-It was like our anniversary
lunch at Hooters all over again.

Don't you know anything
about women?

Uh, you and I dated-- I think
you know the answer to that.

You had the chance to do
something for you and Lyndsey,

and instead you did something
just for yourself.

You know what?

This is my fault.

I gave you
too much power.

You don't give
a monkey a gun.

Did we learn nothing
from Planet of the Apes?

So how do I make this right
for Lyndsey?

Oh. Maybe you could paint
a smiley face on her vagina.

If she had one wish,
what would it be?

To be married to him.

Okay, that's probably true,

but she can't have Walden.

And make sure she knows that.

But I think you might
be on the right track

that she would
like a commitment.

Wow... a commitment.

For years, I-I felt
I should marry Lyndsey,

but, uh, it's never
the right time.

Maybe now is the right time.

I just...

wish I had the money
for an engagement ring.

I'm not getting you an
engagement ring and a Ferrari.

How 'bout a promise ring
and a Beemer?

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Wow.

I've never been to a high-end
jewelry store like this.

Really? Where'd you get
your engagement ring for your ex-wife?

Well, when I met Judith,
I was working at a funeral home.

I'll let you
figure out the rest.

I don't think
I belong here.

You know, I-I feel
out of place.

Just follow my lead,
and keep it classy.

Hi. Welcome to BJ's.

I'm sorry.

Um, what does "BJ" stand for?

Bountiful Jewels.

Oh. You know, I...
I love your ads.

Uh, uh, "Want a
diamond, give a BJ."

Uh, uh, how about this one?

If you're gonna
get down on your knees,

you better be giving a BJ.

We've heard them all, sir.

So, what can we do for you guys?

Uh, well,
to celebrate our divorce,

I'd like to get my ex-husband
an engagement ring

for his on-again,
off-again girlfriend.

Oh, and I might need your card,
in case I propose

to my girlfriend,
his ex-girlfriend,

our social worker.

Also, do you validate?

We do.
So, what kind of cut

were you thinking?

Oh, well, a-a cushion cut
is trÃ¨s in vogue right now.

Oh, on the other hand,
ever since I was a little boy,

I had my heart set
on a princess cut.

I think that she's asking
what Lyndsey would like.

Oh, uh, right, um,
uh, the bride, uh, Lyndsey.

Um, uh, well, you know,
she has very common taste,

so, you know, probably round.

Well, what do you think
of these?

They are both a minimum
of four carats each.

Oh, and, uh,
how much are they?

Oh, dear Lord!

I think I just dropped
four carats in my pants.

Don't worry about the price.

Just get what you want.

Wow. Lyndsey is very lucky

to have a man like you
in my life.

So, do you
see anything you like?

They all look good under
these showroom lights.

I need something
that looks good

in a rent-controlled
apartment in Van Nuys.

Then I suggest this one.

It's flawless.

Oh. Well,
I'll take it.

It'll remind her of me.

Why? Does the diamond
fart a lot?

I'll just go wrap this up.

Wow. Wow!

It's really happening.
Yeah.

You're getting married.

I know. I know.

Pretty soon, I'll be
moving out of the house.

I mean,

I certainly wouldn't expect you

to let Lyndsey and I live
in your guest room.

I mean,
that'-that'd be ridiculous.

Wouldn't it?

Wouldn't it?

Hm... I have the house
all to myself.

I hadn't thought about that.

Yay!

Thank you.

Well, we should
do this more often.

We never get
together anymore.

Oh, we wouldn't miss
your 50th birthday,

here in the year >030.

Why are you telling
us what year it is?

I don't know. I was just
providing some context,

in case people
missed the subtitle.

Well, I really appreciate
you all being here.

And, Louis, I'm glad you could
take time away from college.

I wouldn't miss it, Dad.

Although, today is the big game

between Jupiter State
and Moon University.

Go... Craters!

Wow. Things sure are different
in the year 2030.

Yeah. Lots of things
are different.

All right.

I'm out of here.
What?!

No. You're leaving?

Yeah. I want to get home

and watch the series finale
of The Big Bang Theory.

Matthew McConaughey
is guest starring.

I didn't know President
McConaughey could act.

We should really get going, too.
Yeah.

Oh, no! No. Come on,
stay, guys. The-the...

Wait, wait. Why don't you...
why don't you stay the weekend?

I've have all
these extra rooms.

God, Walden, I am a
successful businessman.

I don't need to live in
your house for free anymore.

I live in Lyndsey's
house for free now.

Bye, guys.
Happy birthday.

Well, I guess it's
just you and me.

And Louis.

Oh, yeah, but

he's just a hologram.

I've got to go.

It's pancake day
in the cafeteria.

Now it's really just
you and me. Hmm.

You want some cake?

Hey, babe. Ready to go?

I sure am.

Rain check on the cake?

How the hell
did you not age?

I'm Michael Freakin' Bolton.

And thanks for introducing us.
Mm.

Get out of my house, Bolton.

Bye, Walden.

Yeah, bye, Walden.

âª When a man steals a woman. âª

Wait, no!
No, no, no, don't leave!

I don't want to be alone!

I don't want to be alone.

Oh, Walden,
what-what are you talking about?

No. You can't leave me.

I'll give you
anything you want.

You can sleep in
the master bedroom,

and I'll sleep on the futon.

Just, you can't marry Lyndsey!

Wait...
you can't ask that of me.

I'll give you the house!

What's your return policy?

You can't give back a BJ.

Oh, God...
I'm gonna die alone!

Well, Walden, relax.

No, I can't relax.

I have seen the future!

Ms. McMartin has
beautiful new boobs,

but I don't get the boobs.

Bolton gets the boobs.

And Louis-- he won't come
home from Moon College!

Oh, calm down.
Calm down, Walden.

Now, I want you
to take a deep breath

and tell me every detail
about Ms. McMartin's boobs.

I can't breathe.

I need air.

Everything is spinning!

My whole world is coming apart!

Could you please buzz me out?

âª Men. âª

Hey, hey, don't
beat yourself up about this.

I mean, everybody freaks out
a little bit every now and then.

I mean, it's like...
it's like when I, uh, lost Louis

for two hours at the mall.

What?

Uh, he found a Wetzel's Pretzel
in the trash.

It was fine.

I'm sorry
I caused a scene back there.

Everything hit me all at once,

and I had this terrifying vision
of the future,

where I-I ended up all alone
in this house.

Terrifying?
Next to my mother dying,

being alone in this house
is my favorite dream.

Oh, it's just, when I think
about the rest of my life,

you're the one constant.

And I know

I joke a lot
about you moving out,

but the only thing...
worse than...

you staying is you leaving.

Don't you think I'm scared, too?

I mean,

I'm trading you
for someone ten years older

and a billion dollars poorer.

Don't put it that way
in the proposal.

Good call. See?

I'm always gonna need you.

And look, it's not like
I'm leaving tomorrow.

Plus, even after Lyndsey
and I are married,

we're still gonna
see each other.

You mean it?

Of course.

I gotta do something
while Lyndsey's at work.

âª Men. âª

Thank you both
for inviting me to dinner.

Well, we just wanted
to cheer you up.

I'm really fine. I'm pretty used
to Alan disappointing me.

That's Alan.
He disappoints us,

then he redeems himself,
only to disappoint us again.

Yeah.

It's the great circle of Alan.

Hello, Lyndsey.

Alan!

Why are you dressed
like the waiters?

That's an unfortunate
coincidence.

I didn't know the restaurant
was gonna be this nice.

What's going on?

Hold that thought
until you hear this.

Um, everybody,
this is Scott.

Uh, he is available
for lessons

at the Valley West
Community College.

Uh, please inquire
after the performance.

There you go, paid in full.
Now play.

Lyndsey Ruth Anne McElroy...

What are you doing?

The right thing for once.

I've been in a lot
of relationships...

Oh, three of whom
are at this table.

But none of them even
come close to what we have.

From the moment I met you,
I knew you were too good for me.

Oh, that's so sweet.

And so true.

Walden asked me to pick anything
in the world that I wanted,

and I pick you.

Ah.

Will you marry me?

That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me,

but I hope you didn't do
anything as silly as waste

your wish on ring...

I'm a princess!
I'm a pretty, pretty princess!

Is that a yes?

Yes!
Ah!

That is so sweet.

It's so beautiful.
So moving.

So... romantic.

In fact... Ms. McMartin,

will you...?
No.

Right, it's too soon.

Don't leave me.

I'm so happy.

This is really
a new beginning.

It is. We get our own place,
our own things, new jobs...

Oh, perfect.

Started the day
with a Ferrari,

ended it with a
wife and a job.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Thanks again
for the engagement ring.

Thanks for being
such a great friend.

Oh, please.

You gave me
a new lease on life.

I mean, after we lost Charlie,
I thought we were done.

We?

Well, you know, me,
uh, Berta, Jake,

my mom, Lyndsey,

all the crazy characters who've
walked into this amazing house.

Yeah, it's been a pretty
wacky last four years, huh?

Yeah.

Had a lot of laughs.

Imagine how weird
it would be without the laughs.

âª Men. âª

Charlie lived life
to its fullest

and-and gave it
everything he had.

Gave me herpes.

Vaginal warts.

He used my panties
to make tea.

My point is, um, that Charlie
lived life on his own terms.

Blah, blah, blah.
Why can't we see the body?

Charlie Harper
was the love of my life

and a wonderful, wonderful man.

He slipped on the Metro platform

and fell in front
of an oncoming train.

His body just exploded
like a balloon full of meat.

I know what you said
you wanted, but...

I really don't think
Pamela Anderson will agree

to swallow your ashes.

I ain't cleaning him up.

âª Men. âª

âª Imagine me and you, I do

âª I think about you
day and night âª

âª It's only right

âª To think about
the boy you love âª

âª And hold him tight

âª So happy together

âª So how is the weather?

âª Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba

âª Ba, Ba-Ba-Ba, Ba-Ba, Ba

âª Ba-Ba, Ba, Ba.

Lunchtime.

Here you go.

Tuna on toast...

with vodka.

Oh, don't give me that look.

It needs to eat.

Oh, is it sulking?

Well, if it doesn't eat,

it gets the hose.

That's better.

And pick up the napkin.

Just because it lives in a pit,

it doesn't have to live
like an animal.

Thank you.

And after it eats,

it changes its clothes.

âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,

Got any good mail?

Uh, let's see.
Uh, electric bill,

cable bill, water bill.
Here you go.

Do you ever
experience shame?

Uh, shame is
a rich man's emotion.

I can barely afford
embarrassment.

Oh, wow.

Something for Charlie.

I-I told you to cancel
his subscription

to the Sex Toy
of the Month Club.

Oh, can't.
He paid for life.

And, uh, January
was butt plug month.

Oh. Oh, it's, uh...
it's from his music publisher.

You okay?

I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

Look.

"Dear Mr. Harper:

"We are holding unclaimed
music royalties for you

in the amount of $2.5 million."

Looks like those
children's records he made

are still making money.

Uh, say the number again.

$2.5 million.

Apparently, it's been
stacking up since he died.

Like the butt plugs.

Alan, you do realize that money
will go to his next of kin.

Uh, yeah. That's me.

Why do think I keep going...

What about your mother
and his daughter?

Oh, you're serious.

Alan, you can't keep that kind
of money secret from them.

Why not? I kept from you

that I used your Tesla
to drive for Uber.

Hello.
Yes, I-I just received a notice

of unclaimed royalties
for Charlie Harper

that I would like to claim.

Oh, oh, yeah, sure, I'll hold.

What are you doing?
Uh, claiming.

Uh, yes, yes. Hi.

Uh, I am, uh, Alan Harper.

Uh, I'm Charlie Harper's
next of kin.

Yes, uh, uh, sadly, he-he
passed away four years ago.

Yes, I-I am sorry, too.

Uh, he's irreplaceable.

Uh, anyway, um...

I guess you can just, you know,
send me the check and...

Uh, death certificate?

Uh, o-okay, uh, is that...

is that necessary
to get the money?

Okay. Uh, how about, uh,
you send me the check,

I'll send you
the death certificate?

Or we can do it your way.

Uh, uh, oh, oh,

and by the way, um, uh,
when you give me the money,

do you notify the IRS,
or is that my responsibility?

Mine! Perfect.

Uh, bye-bye.

Our divorce is final, right?

Alan, I neither want
nor need your money.

Oh, I know that, uh,

but could you say that
again on camera?

O-Okay, okay.

You don't have
the death certificate, do you?

No, but I'm sure my mom does.

How are you
going to get it from her

without telling her
about the money?

Uh, remember four years ago

how I told you I'd only
be here for a few days?

I think I can figure it out.

I can't wait for this
to be over.

âª Men. âª

Well, this is a surprise.

You visit so seldom.

I know. I know.

I need to do it more.

I wasn't complaining.

So, how have you been?

Well, uh, uh, it's
funny you should ask.

Um, I've been doing a
lot of thinking lately.

I'm not giving you
a penny.

I, uh... I didn't
come for money.

Or a place to live or a car.

Or affection or
nurturing. I get it.

Uh, uh, I was thinking.

You know, um, well, maybe
it's my age, but, uh,

I'm starting to reflect
on the big questions.

You know, what's...
what's it all about?

Uh, why are we here?

What happens when we die?

I know what happens
when I die.

You get nothing.

Mom, I-I told you,
I did not come here...

Really? Nothing?

It's not because
I don't love you.

I just don't want to give you
a reason to kill me.

You mean another reason.

Where are all these
morbid thoughts coming from?

As long as I've known you,

you've never been
much of a thinker.

Or a... a doer
or a provider or...

pretty much anything
with "er" at the end.

Maybe I've been asking all
these questions because

the anniversary of Charlie's
death is coming up.

So?
- So I was thinking

it might be nice to do
something to commemorate it.

Like what? Snort coke
off a hooker's butt?

Uh, actually, uh,
uh, more like, uh,

make a...
a memorial collage.

A what?

A... a memorial collage.

You know, a collection of
images celebrating his life.

Uh, things like, uh,
his birth certificate,

uh, family pictures,
death certificate,

uh, awards, sheet
music, diplomas,

death certificate, um...

I don't know how much
I can help you.

I-I've got his
birth certificate,

a few baby pictures,

the little hash pipe
he made in camp.

No death certificate?

No.

I-I just thought you had it.

Oh. Well, bye.

âª Men. âª

I'm sorry. I can't find any
record of your brother's death.

You sure?
Uh, newspapers, obituaries?

No, I checked everything
on Charlie Harper--

both here and in France-- and...

I-I found a bunch
of weird self-shot sex videos,

including one featuring
what appears to be

the USC men's water polo team?

I also found this crazy rant
about a former employer.

But there's nothing
about his death.

How is that possible?

Did you ever see the body?

There was no body.
The man was hit by a train.

All that was left was a...

a meat smoothie
and a couple of teeth.

Well, how do you know
he's really dead?

Well, of course he's dead.
I have his ashes.

How do you know
that they're his ashes?

Well, what do you want me to do,
test them for herpes?

âª Men. âª

âª Twinkle, twinkle,
little star âª

âª I always know
just where you are âª

âª In a pit below my house

âª You will always
be my spouse. âª

Oh, boy.

Never put a window in a dungeon.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

Yes, I am calling
about the $2.5 million

in unclaimed royalties
for Charlie Harper.

Uh, uh, good news.

Uh, I have just received

the death certificate
from France.

Uh, it's in French
and everything

so you know it's real.

Oh, oh, sure, I'll hold.

Uh, "cause de dÃ©cÃ¨s."

Uh... uh, Le...

train.

Oh, yes, yes, I'm still here.

What?

It's already been claimed?

By whom?

Was it an older red-headed woman

wearing a coat
made of Dalmatians?

What do you mean,
you can't tell me?

A... a numbered account
in the Cayman Islands?

That makes no sense.

FedEx just dropped off
a box addressed to Charlie.

Uh... uh, uh,
I'll call you back.

If that's a blow-up sex doll,
can I have it?

My grandkids need a pool toy.

Cuban cigars?

Charlie's favorite smokes.

Single malt scotch?

Charlie's favorite breakfast.

What the hell?

Looks the knife he used to
chase you around the house with.

Yeah, that's it.

"I'm coming home,
and you're going to pay."

That's got to be a wrong number.

You never pay for anything.

âª Men. âª

Walden!
- Alan?

Ms. McMartin, I'm sorry.
Uh, where's Walden?

I'm a little busy, Alan.

Oh, okay.

Uh, are-are you aware
she's reading Cosmo?

It's a how-to article.

Well, it's not
so much "how to,"

as "how to do it better."

Seriously?

Hey. Even Tiger Woods
needs a swing coach.

Listen, can you

just come back in,
like, what, 20 minutes?

Eh...

No. This can't wait.
Look at this text.

Okay, that can't
be for you.

You never pay
for anything.

I think, somehow, some way...

Charlie is still alive.

Okay, this is ridiculous.

There's more.
A package came addressed to him.

Oh, is it something
that vibrates?

'Cause I could really
use some help with this.

He ain't lying.

No. It's-it's-it's not sex toys.

I am telling you,
Charlie is coming back,

and he is not happy with me.

Well, at the moment,
neither am I.

Should I go?

No, no, no, no, no.
We're so close.

Eh-eh...

Walden, it's like you said.

I mean, there was no proof
that Charlie ever died.

All we have is Rose's word.

Who's Rose?

Oh, she's this
crazy millionairess

that used to stalk Charlie,

and then he
married her.

And then she started
stalking me.

Why? Did you
sleep with her?

Alan slept with her, too.

Hey, after 12 years,

everybody's slept
with everybody.

Alan!
Alan, where are you?

Uh, in here!

Oh, for God sakes!

That's my mother. Uh, oh,
Walden slept with her, too.

Uh... you slept with my mom!

No, that was just a handy
in a hotel bar.

I am a gentleman.

We need to talk.

Oh. Who's this?

Uh, this is my son's
social worker, Ms. McMartin.

And you're shtupping her.
How lovely.

Uh, Mom, don't be rude.

Uh, and I shtupped her first.

I really should go.

Yeah. Uh, okay.

Just remember
which step we're on.

Number six:

"finding the little man
in the canoe."

I don't remember you
having any trouble...

Okay, everybody stop!

What are you doing here?

I want to know why you sent
me this hateful e-mail.

Uh, "Dear Mom:

"You were always
a horrible mother

"and a repulsive
human being,

"and I hope you
rot in hell.

"But before you do,

I will have my revenge."

Okay, I don't disagree
with anything here...

...but I did not send that.

Really? Who else would call
me "a horrible mother"?

No, no, it's still ridiculous.

What's ridiculous?

Alan has this crazy idea

that Charlie's still alive.

But then who sent her
that e-mail?

Who sent me this text?

Where did the cigars, booze
and chasin' knife come from?

Wait, what's a chasin' knife?

Uh, it's a regular knife

after two bottles
of scotch and some blow.

Who else would have sent it?

I don't know.

Like, somebody that wants
to freak you out.

Think about it: Who has
something to gain from this?

Who else has a claim
on that money?

What money?

No money.
There's no money.

Alan, will you just tell her?

I don't want to.

Alan!

Turns out, uh, there are
some unclaimed royalties,

uh, from Charlie's recordings.

How much?

Uh, two and a half...
thousand dollars.

Alan!

Million.

$2.5 million.

Ah, the memorial
collage.

That's why you wanted
the death certificate--

so you could
claim the money.

You dirty rat bastard.

What would you have done?

We're wasting time here.

Now, who else could have
a claim on the money?

Oh, God!

Ah, damn it.

She found the
little man without me.

âª Men. âª

Anyway, we were thinking
of putting together

a sort of memorial collage...

Oh, for God sakes,
will you just tell her?

Um, some money owed to your
father has been discovered.

Really? How much?

Two and a half thousand.

Million.
It's $2.5 million.

Why are you here?

You know what? I've been asking
myself that since day one.

Honestly, I forgot she was here.

Look, anyway,

somebody claimed it
and transferred it

into a numbered account
in the Caymans.

And you think it was me?

Would I be living
in a one-bedroom apartment

if I had that kind of money?

I don't have my contacts in.

Was that the same one
or different?

Excuse me.

Wow. You hang a penis
on that girl,

and you've got Charlie.

Thank you. Huh.

Certified letter
from a law firm.

Might mean traveling money.
Stand by.

Oh, my God.

What is it?

Am I seeing that right?
That's a lot of zeroes.

It's a cashier's check
for $100,000.

Who's it from?

I don't know.
Oh, but there's a note.

It says,
"Buy yourself something nice.

Sorry I wasn't there for you."

I don't care who it's from.

Apology accepted.

Is the bathroom in here?

âª Men. âª

"Buy yourself something nice.

"Sorry I broke your heart...

"and banged your sister.

As I write this, I realize those
two things might be related."

Hmm. Screw my sister.

âª Men. âª

"Buy yourself something nice.

"Sorry I shot you.

I didn't know I was loaded."

âª Men. âª

"Buy yourself something nice.

Tell your mom I'm sorry
I gave her chlamydia."

âª Men. âª

"Sorry I never called.

Buy yourself a nice vagina."

Aw.

âª Men. âª

Well, obviously Jenny
didn't claim the royalties.

Why would she send
a check to herself?

Yeah, but you still
don't know it was Charlie.

Oh, who else is going to send

an unemployed lesbian actress
$100,000?

I don't know.
Ellen DeGeneres?

I'm telling you,
Charlie's alive.

Oh, good.

Then I don't have to tell you.

âª Men, men, men. âª

âª Men. âª

Charlie is still alive?

Yeah, kinda.

What do you mean, "kinda"?

'Cause she "kinda" drank when
she was pregnant with me,

and now I "kinda"
can't do math.

Hey.

Hey.
What are you still doing here?

Oh, I accidentally fell asleep
in Zippy's room.

How do you accidentally
fall asleep?

You accidentally wash down
your pain pills with scotch.

What's Fatal Attraction
doing here?

She says that Charlie
is still alive.

I knew it.

Alan,

if you move out

and Charlie stays here
with Walden,

I believe that we can
keep this going

for another five years.

Yeah, I don't think so.

Uh... so, uh...

what exactly
happened to Charlie?

Yeah, start from
the beginning.

You mean from the pilot?

No, uh, what happened to my
brother after you married him?

Oh.

Well, we had
a wonderful wedding,

and then we flew to Paris
for our honeymoon.

We were so happy.
So animated.

We went up
on the Eiffel Tower...

and went down
on the Champs-ElysÃ©es.

Ooh!

Afterwards,
we celebrated our love

with a romantic
candlelit dinner at the Ritz.

Of course, I've always known
Charlie was no saint,

but I thought marriage
would change him.

Huh?

I was wrong.

So wrong.

Huh?

Disturbingly wrong.

I ran from the room, determined
to never see him again.

Charlie...

He finally caught up with me
at the train station,

but all I could
think about was...

revenge.

But at the last second,
fate intervened.

So I booked us a cruise home.

We moved in to a brand-new
house in Sherman Oaks--

the good part,
south of the boulevard--

where we could live
as a happy couple.

Wait a minute.

You bought a house
with a dungeon?

And a pit?

Of course not.

I had it remodeled.

The permit process
was just a nightmare.

Next time,
use my pit guy.

He's the best.

Continue.

For the next four years,

we were the happiest
we'd ever been.

I'd feed him...

bathe him...

and, of course,
there was endless

magical lovemaking.

Then, a few days ago,
the unthinkable happened.

Somehow, he managed
to make a rope

out of his bowling shirts
and ran away,

disappearing into the darkness.

Th-Th-Th-That's all, folks.

âª Men. âª

Charlie escaped?

Uh, no.

Prisoners escape.

Lovers run away because
they're afraid of commitment.

Any-who, I just thought
I should tell you.

You know, in case he drops by
and guts you all like fish.

Why me? He doesn't
even know me.

Oh, I told him all about you--

how you're richer than him,
prettier than him,

and moved into his house
and carried on

like he never existed.

Thank you.

Hold on, Rose.

If Charlie is alive,
who's in the urn?

Oh. That's Billy.

Who's Billy?

The bisexual goat

who gave his life
that your son might live.

So... so, what are we
supposed to do now?

Wait a second.

Are we really not gonna
talk about the fact

that Charlie was having
sex with a goat?

Well, you didn't know Charlie.

It would have been weirder
if he hadn't.

Well, now that
you're all caught up,

I'll say my good-byes.

You're leaving?

Um, yeah.

I'm not gonna stick around
to find out

what he's going to do to me just
because I loved him too much.

Toodles.

Nah. That's just stupid.

No... no, no, no, no,
this is ridiculous.

He's not gonna hurt anybody.

Oh, of course not.

Rose, wait up.

What, you're...
you're leaving, too?

Alan, your brother
wasn't very pleasant

if he missed his morning coffee.

How do you think
he's going to be

after four years in a pit?

So you're just gonna bail?

Uh... yep.

Berta, good-bye.

I never really cared for you.

Right back at you, Red.

Walden...

I loved you like a son.

Alan...

good luck.

Well, I-I guess
we should go, too.

Hold on.

We're not really gonna run

'cause of some
crazy woman's story

and some vague text threats.

Okay, this one's
a little more specific.

What does it say?

"You despicable troll.

"You thought you could
replace my ninja awesomeness,

"you lame clown?

"I will deploy my army of
assassins to destroy you.

"I will bring my
bayonets of truth

"to the hexagon of death,

"where I will carve my initials
into your reptilian skull

and cover you in
tiger's blood."

Hard to believe he wrote
children's songs, isn't it?

Yeah, we're gonna
need some help.

Yeah, we're gonna need
a lot of help.

Here, try these.

They won't keep him
from hurting you,

but they will keep you
from feeling it.

âª Men. âª

Uh, thank you for
meeting with us

on such short
notice, Lieutenant.

Anything for you, my friend.

How can I help?

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

So, uh, that's about it,
uh, uh, Lieutenant...

Wagner.
Uh, Wagner.

No, not Wagner; Wagner.

Uh, W-A-G-N-E-R.
Wagner.

"Vhatever."

All right, now, let me see
if I got this straight.

12 years ago,
your wife kicked you out,

and then you and your dumb son
moved in with your brother.

Uh, uh, he wasn't dumb
at the beginning.

Uh, he got dumb later on.

What happened?

Uh, well, turned out
it was funnier.

All right.

So your brother then
let you stay there

eight and a half years
rent-free,

even though you claim
that he never liked you.

Ah. Ah, you're not the only one
to point out the illogic.

And this brother of yours
supposedly died in Paris

under mysterious circumstances.

It wasn't all that mysterious.

I mean, he was taking
a lot of drugs

and pissed off almost everybody.

And then you tried
to drown yourself,

but you changed your mind
because the water was too cold.

And then you got into his house
and offered to buy it.

It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

And then you let him and his son
stay there for four more years.

Right.

Rent-free.

Well, when you say
it like that,

it sounds ridiculous.

And then your dead brother's

previously unknown
lesbian daughter shows up,

and then you let her move in.

You can't
write this stuff, huh?

And then the two of you
got married to each other.

Yes.

But you're not gay.

Well, I'm not.

And then you adopted
a black child.

Ah, ah, he's, uh...
he's more Eurasian.

Uh...

Oh, what a sweetie pie.

And the two of you
are now divorced?

Mmm.

But you're living together.

If I leave,
the whole thing falls apart.

Yeah, of course.

Uh, and now the woman
who stalked your brother

and then married him

all of a sudden shows up
and she says

that he's not dead after all,
that she has been keeping him

in a dungeon pit
in the San Fernando Valley.

Ah, uh, Sherman Oaks.

Uh, but the good part--
uh, south of the boulevard.

And then he escaped,

and he sent you cigars
and whiskey.

Oh, and don't forget
the chasin' knife.

Oh, and the
threatening text.

He said, uh,
"I'm coming home,

and you're gonna pay."

I'm confused.

'Cause you said he doesn't pay
for anything.

I think the point is,

is that we need you
to find him becau...

This guy has some
serious rage issues.

Has he tried anger management?

Yeah, but it didn't work.

Okay.

Well, I have
this inscription now,

and so if we find him,
I'll let you know.

Uh, well...
- Thank you.

Uh, really appreciate it.

No problem.

Now, if I can, uh,

offer you a word of advice...

Mm-hmm?

I would consider
wrapping this whole thing up.

Uh, what do you mean?

I mean the whole
living arrangement.

The kids, the girls,
the beach house.

I mean, this whole thing
has been going on way too long.

Yeah, a lot of people
been saying that.

Haters gonna hate.

âª Men. âª

We should get out of town
for a couple of days.

You know, go to
a nice resort,

uh, get some facials,
Mani-pedis.

You know, a
guys' weekend.

No... we're not going anywhere.

We got a state-of-the-art
security system.

Nobody gets in
unless we let them in.

What the hell?

"We got a state-of-the-art
security system.

No one gets in unless
we let them in."

Shut up.
No, you shut up.

Hey.

Jake?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

Hey!

What are you
doing here?

Yeah, I thought
you were in the Army.

Come on. Look at me.

Do I look like someone
who's in the Army?

Not on our side.

Come in.

Hey. These are pretty cool.
Where'd you get them? Target?

You get it? 'Cause of the...
there's the circles...

Yeah, no, no, I got it.
I got it. No.

Here's the thing.

It turns out that
your Uncle Charlie

might still be alive.

Oh.

That would explain why
I got a check for $250,000

and a note that said,
"I'm alive."

You have $250,000?

Not anymore. I stopped in
in Vegas on the way here.

Oh, God. How much
do you have left?

Two and a half million.

Oh!

You won $2.5 million?

Oh, yeah.
It's not that hard.

I kept playing craps
because, you know, "crap."

Oh, and I kept
betting on come, because...

Wow. That's... amazing
that you made so much money

with such stupid jokes.

Taterhead!

Hey, Berta.

Oh, look at you!

You look like a grown man.

Really? Which one?

I've missed you.

Berta, what are you
still doing here?

No idea.

By the way, you're out of pot.

Where'd these things come from?
Target?

Ah.

Too late.

I already did that joke.
Ah...

No, somebody
left them here.

You didn't
hear anything?

I heard colors.

No, I-I am telling you,

Charlie is planning
on killing us all.

Okay. It was good
to see you guys.

Wait, Th-that's it?
You're leaving?

Oh, nothing personal--
I just got to get back to Japan

and tell my wife and kids
that we're rich.

You're...
you're married?

Yeah. Didn't I mention that?

No.

Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa.
You have kids?

Well, they're hers.

She's a dancer.

Uh, let me guess--
a pole dancer?

No, she's Japanese.

Well, see you.

All right, all right, we-we
got to close these shades.

Anybody on the beach will
have a clear shot at us.

Right.

Do this...

Man, it sucks to be you guys.

âª Men. âª

Hello?

Judith, it's me.

Oh, hey, Alan.

Isn't it wonderful about Jake?

Uh, yeah, wonderful.
Listen...

Did he give you $100,000, too?

He gave you $100,000?

No. What do you want?

Uh, uh, okay, long story short--

it turns out my brother is alive
and he's out for revenge.

Revenge? For what?

Well, he didn't think
I could go on without him.

He thought I was more of

a supporting character
in his life,

but it turns out
I-I was sort of a co-lead.

Um, a-anyway,
I just wanted you to know

that if anything
were to happen to me,

you were the love of my life.

Oh, Alan, that is so sweet.

Hang on, honey.
I'm getting another call.

She's not coming back.

âª Men. âª

Hello?

Bridget, hi.

It's Walden.

Hey, Walden. What's up?

I can't go into detail,
but I just...

I wanted to say that I wish
I'd been a better husband.

Well, thank you.

And I just want to say that...

I'm having sex with John Stamos.

I'm not lying.

Go for Stamos.

Stamos, you're just
a handsome guy

who got lucky on a sitcom.

Listen, um, I'm just gonna
set the phone down

so you can listen to me
shish-kebab your old lady, okay?

Bye-bye.

âª Men. âª

Hold on, fellas.

Hello.

Uh, Kandi, it's Alan.

Oh, hi, Alan!

I just wanted you to know that,

even though we were only married
for a short time,

you were the love of my life.

Oh, how sweet.

And you were the first guy
I had tushy sex with.

You guys didn't hear that.

âª Men. âª

Hello.

Zoey.

Hi. It's Walden.

Oh, Walden.

How are you, darling?

Uh, not so good.

Uh... that's why I'm calling.

I... I just wanted
to tell you that...

I've been thinking
about you lately, and...

I'm sorry about
the way things ended.

Oh, well...
water under the bridge.

Listen, I'd love to chat,

but I'm in the middle
of a coronation.

Of a what?

A coronation.

I married King Rupert
of Moldavia,

and I'm being
crowned queen, so...

You're the queen of Moldavia?

What can I say?

Thank you, JDate.

Shalom.

Darling,
you still breathing?

âª Men. âª

Hello?

Lyndsey, it's Alan.

Hi, Alan.

I was just showing off

the beautiful engagement ring
you gave me.

Great. Listen,
I-I just wanted you to know

that if anything
were to happen to me,

you were the love of my life.

Oh, baby.

You're the love of my life.

So, how much?

âª Men. âª

Okay, I will say
it one more time.

Resort hotel
till the cops find him.

We can be in Vegas in two hours.

Styx is playing Mandalay Bay.

No, if I let Charlie
drive me out of this house,

I reward his bad behavior.

Yeah. That's only supposed
to happen in show business.

Which we are not in.

Not anymore.

Oh. Hello?

Valden?
Walden.

That's what I said.

Look, I have good news.

We found your boy.

They found Charlie.

Are-are they sure?

Uh, uh, are...
are you sure it's him?

Well, he matches
the description.

Bowling shirt, cargo shorts,

and he's babbling away
incoherently.

That sounds like him.

Wh-Where'd you find him?

In a trashed hotel room

with a hooker in the closet.

That's absolutely him.

Oh, my...
Thank you so much.

This is a huge relief.

Oh, you're welcome.

Uh, see you in the gym.

Okay. Hasta la vista.

I'm telling you,
I'm not Charlie Harper.

Then who are you?

My name is Christian Slater.

I'm an actor, all right?

I was in a bar, and this guy
hands me a drink.

Next thing I know,
I wake up in a hotel room

dressed like a 12-year-old,

with a screaming woman
in the closet.

Yeah, right.

And I'm the governor
of California.

That bitch stole my watch.

âª Men. âª

âª Men. âª

What do you think
Charlie will do

when he gets out
of jail?

Well, if the past
is any indication,

he'll sober up and reflect
on his past mistakes,

apologize to everyone,

and then do something
even worse.

See, I'm not so pessimistic.

I'm hoping someday
he and I can be buddies.

Good one.

By the way,

when this cigar is done,
so am I.

Yeah, you calling it a day?

Calling it a career.

You're quitting?

I didn't want to rub
your nose in it,

but Charlie sent me
a big-ass check,

so I'm out of here.

Where you gonna go?

Don't know.

Somewhere the sun is bright,

the pot is strong
and the men are stupid.

That's here.

You're right.

I'm staying.

Wow.

Look at that.

Someone's having a piano
delivered by helicopter.

Mmm. That's the kind
of extravagant thing

Charlie would do.

Oh, uh, he had a baby grand
just like that.

It's coming right this way.

You don't think
that it's possible

that the cops got
the wrong guy, do you?

Nah.
- Nah.

Winning.
