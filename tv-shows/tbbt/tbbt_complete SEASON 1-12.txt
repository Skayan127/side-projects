If a photon is directed through a plane
with two slits in it and either is observed...

...it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.

If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...

- ...it will not have gone through both slits.
- Agreed.

What's your point?

There's no point,
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov.

Twenty-six across is MCM.

Fourteen down is...

Move your finger.

...phylum, which makes 14 across
Port-Au-Prince.

See, Papa Doc's capital idea,
that's Port-Au-Prince.

Haiti.

- Can I help you?
- Yes.

Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

I think this is the place.

- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

- We'll be right back.
- Oh, take your time.

I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

Oh, wait.

Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

What, are you kidding? You're a semipro.

No. We are committing genetic fraud.

There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

Think about that.

I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

Sheldon, this was your idea.

A little extra money to get
fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?

I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

...a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

Well, what do you wanna do?

- I want to leave.
- Okay.

- What's the protocol for leaving?
- I don't know.

I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

Let's try just walking out.

Okay.

- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

Nice meeting you.

- Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
- No.

You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

Not really.

If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

- ...most people will trip.
- I don't care.

Two millime...? That doesn't seem right.

It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 12.

My father broke his clavicle.

Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

[LILY ALLEN'S "SMILE" PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]

I go ahead and smile

New neighbor?

SHELDON:
Evidently.

Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

Two-hundred pound transvestite
with a skin condition? Yes, she is.

Oh, hi.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Hi?

We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

Oh, that's nice.

No. We don't live together. I mean...

...we live together, but in separate,
heterosexual bedrooms.

Okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor.

- Penny.
- Leonard. Sheldon.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Hi.

Well...

Oh, welcome to the building.

Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

- Oh, great.
- Great.

- Great.
- Great.

Well, bye.

- Bye.
- Bye.

Should we have invited her for lunch?

No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

We already watched
the season two DVDs.

Not with commentary.

I think we should be good neighbors.

Invite her over, make her feel welcome.

We never invited Louie/Louise over.

Well, and that was wrong of us.

We need to widen our circle.

I have a very wide circle.

I have 212 friends on MySpace.

Yes, and you've never met one of them.

That's the beauty of it.

I'm gonna invite her over.

We'll have a nice meal and chat.

Chat? We don't chat,
at least not off-line.

Well, it's not difficult.

You just listen to what she says...

...and then you say something appropriate
in response.

To what end?

- Hi. Again.
- Hi.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Anyway...

...we brought home Indian food...

...and I know that
moving can be stressful...

...and I find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

...that good food
and company can have a comforting effect.

Also, curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that, you know...

...a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

I'm no expert,
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

...you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?

Yes.

Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.

Great.

So, what do you guys do for fun
around here?

Well, today we tried masturbating
for money.

- Okay, well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

[MOUTHS]
You're very welcome.

This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?

Actually, that's my work.

Wow.

Yeah, well, it's just some
quantum mechanics...

...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

So you're, like, one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

Yeah.

This is really impressive.

I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.

Holy smokes.

If by "holy smokes," you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

...you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

- What?
- Oh, come on.

Who hasn't seen this differential below
"here I sit brokenhearted"?

At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the math come out.

- I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe?

In all of them, that is the point.

Do you guys mind if I start?

- Penny.
- Yeah?

That's where I sit.

So sit next to me.

- No, I sit there.
- What's the difference?

- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...

...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

I could go on,
but I think I've made my point.

Do you want me to move?

- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

Fine.

Sheldon, sit.

Ah.

Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.

That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

Yes, I know.

Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle
until 1 in the morning.

- Yeah, I remember.
- I resent you saying we don't have company.

- That has a negative social implication.
- I said I'm sorry.

So...

...Klingon Boggle?

Yeah. It's like regular Boggle,
but in Klingon.

That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

Me? Okay.

I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

...at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

Participate in the what?

I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

...is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

Oh, yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

Okay, let's see, what else?

Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

No, except for fish,
and the occasional steak. I love steak.

Well, that's interesting.

Leonard can't process corn.

So do you have some sort of a job?

PENNY:
Oh, yeah.

I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

I love cheesecake.

- You're lactose intolerant.
- I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.

Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...

...to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

So it's based on your life.

No, I'm from Omaha.

If that was a movie, I would go see it.

I know, right?

Okay, let's see, what else?

I guess that's about it.

That's the story of Penny.

Well, it sounds wonderful.

It was.

Until I fell in love with a jerk.

What is happening?

[MOUTHS]
I don't know.

Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.

Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

It took you four years
to get through high school?

I just... I can't believe I trusted him.

Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.

You? No, you'll only make it worse.

You wanna know the most pathetic part?

Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

...I still love him.

Is that crazy?

Yes.

No, it's not crazy. It's a...

It's a paradox.

Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.

If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.

But then, along comes Albert Einstein...

...and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.

Well, I didn't make it worse.

Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.

And on top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving...

...and my stupid shower doesn't work.

Our shower works.

Really? Would it be totally weird
if I used it?

- Yes.
- No.

- No?
- No.

No.

It's right down the hall.

Okay, thanks.

You guys are really sweet.

Well, this is an interesting development.

LEONARD:
How so?

SHELDON:
It has been some time...

...since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.

That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

...my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

...after which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.

The worst part
was watching her carve that turkey.

So, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish here?

Excuse me?

That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.

Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

I'm a male and she's a female.

Yes, but not of the same species.

I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

- I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
- Oh, of course.

That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...

...that I wouldn't participate.

However briefly.

Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

...when she discovers your Luke Skywalker
"no more tears" shampoo?

It's Darth Vader shampoo.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

- Wait till you see this.
- It's fantastic. Unbelievable.

See what?

It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT
in 1974.

This isn't a good time.

[IMITATING COMPUTERIZED VOICE]
It's before he became...

...a creepy computer voice.

- That's great, you guys have to go.
- Why?

- It's just not a good time.
- Leonard has a lady over.

[IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah, right.
Your grandmother back in town?

No.

And she's not a lady,
she's just a new neighbor.

Hang on, there really is a lady here?

- Uh-huh.
- And you want us out...

...because you're anticipating coitus?

- I'm not anticipating coitus.
- So she's available for coitus?

Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

Technically,
that would be coitus interruptus.

Hey, is there a trick
to getting it to switch from tub to shower?

Oh, hi, sorry.

Hello.

EnchantÃ©, mademoiselle.

Howard Wolowitz,
CalTech Department of Applied Physics.

You may be familiar
with some of my work.

It's currently orbiting
Jupiter's largest moon...

...taking high-resolution
digital photographs.

Penny. I work at
The Cheesecake Factory.

- I'll show you the trick with the shower.
- Okay.

[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]

I'm sorry?

It's French for "good shower."

It's a sentiment I can express
in six languages.

Save it for your blog, Howard.

[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

LEONARD: All right, there it goes.
It sticks, I'm sorry.

- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

Oh, you're just gonna step right...? Okay.

PENNY: Hey, Leonard?
- The hair products are Sheldon's.

PENNY:
Okay.

- Um, can I ask you a favor?
- A favor?

Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

- It's okay if you say no.
- Oh, I'll probably say yes.

It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

Wow.

I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

- Must we?
- Event A:

A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

Event B: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...

...from the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.

Query: On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...

...between these events?

She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.

Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...

...but we both know it exists
in contradistinction...

...to the higher-level distal cause.

- Which is?
- You think with your penis.

That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

...in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

And why can't she get her own TV?

Come on, you know how it is
with breakups.

No, I don't, and neither do you.

But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.

You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

To mend her broken heart.

This situation is much less complicated.

There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...

...as to who gets custody of the TV.

- She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him?

No, Sheldon,
there's not going to be a scene.

There's two of us and one of him.

Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon
at the university?

I'm sorry, do you speak English?

Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

Really? Why?

He's kind of a nerd.

Juice box?

- I'll do the talking.
MAN: Yeah?

- Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
- Hello.

What did I just...?

- We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
- Get lost.

Okay, thanks for your time.

- We're not gonna give up just like that.
- Leonard, the TV's in the building.

We've been denied access to the building,
ergo we are done.

Excuse me. If I were to give up at the first
hitch, I never would have identified...

...the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang.

My apologies. What's your plan?

It's just a privilege
to watch your mind at work.

Come on,
we have a combined IQ of 360.

We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.

[BUZZES]

- What do you think their combined IQ is?
- Just grab the door.

LEONARD:
This is it.

I'll do the talking.

Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.

- Yeah?
- I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

From the intercom.

How the hell did you get in the building?

We're scientists.

Tell him about our IQ.

- Leonard.
- What?

- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

You're gonna have to call her.

Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

And you were right about my motives.

I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny...

...that might have someday led to sex.

SHELDON:
Well, you got me out of my pants.

Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

I've got my work.

One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

SHELDON: And you're certainly
not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

They have a great house ale.

PENNY:
Wow, cool tiger.

Yeah, I've had him since Level 10.

His name is Buttons.

Anyway, if you had
your own game character...

...we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

- That sounds interesting.
- So you'll think about it?

Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

Smooth.

- We're home.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

I'm so sorry.

I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

No, it was a valid hypothesis.

That was a valid hypo...?
What is happening to you?

Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.

You just... You're so terrific.

Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?

- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

Okay.

You're not done with her, are you?

Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

Not to mention imaginary.

- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
- Sure.

We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.

- So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines.

- So?
- It would be gastronomically redundant.

I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

Any ideas, Raj?

Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

I know a wonderful little sushi bar
that has karaoke.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

[SINGING]
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Oh, baby, baby
Don't get hooked on me

I don't know your odds
in the world as a whole...

...but as far as the population of this car
goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.

Baby, don't get hooked on me

[English - US - SDH]

Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

Does it have peanut oil?

I'm not sure.

Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Here we go.

Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

...which then goes into their mouth.

Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

I'll get it.

Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

- Am I interrupting?
- No.

SHELDON:
You're not swelling, Howard.

HOWARD: No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...

...people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

Yeah.

I was wondering
if you could help me out...

- Yes.
- Oh.

Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

...and I may not be here, so, oh...

Hello.

[SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN]

I'm sorry?

Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.

Yeah, I probably won't.

- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

Hey, Raj.

Still not talking to me, huh?

Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.

Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

- There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
- Yeah.

If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.

Thank you.

- Penny, wait.
- Yeah?

Um...

If you don't have any other plans...

...do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

You're kidding, right?

I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

...and Superman catches her.

- Which one was that?
- One.

You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

Yes, I know, men can't fly.

No, let's assume that they can.

Lois Lane is falling.

Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

In what space, sir? In what space?

She's 2 feet above the ground.

If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't...

Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

Are you listening to yourself?

Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

How does he fly at night?

A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

I'm just gonna go wash up.

I have 2600 comic books in there.

I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

Challenge accepted.

We're locked out.

Also, the pretty girl left.

Okay.

Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna...

Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.

Why not?

Well, we don't have a dolly...

...or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

It's just a matter... I don't have this!
I do not have this!

Archimedes would be so proud.

Do you have any ideas?

Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

Easy. Easy.

Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

...call it 30 degrees, so about half.

Exactly half.

Let's push.

Okay.

See, it's moving. This is easy.

It's all in the math.

- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

Oh, okay.

Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

You do understand
that our efforts here...

...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

Almost there.

- Almost there.
SHELDON: No, we're not.

- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.

- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

Oh, God, my fingers!

- You okay?
- No, it hurt...

Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

So Penny is a little messy.

A little messy?

The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

This is chaos.

Excuse me.

Explain to me a system...

...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

...organize and label
the entire world around them?

No.

Well, they don't.

Hard as it may be to believe...

...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

Sheldon, this is not your home.

This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

Because it was immaculate.

I mean, you open that man's closet...

...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

- No.
- No?

- No.
- No.

- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.

Thank you again.

Penny?

I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

I'm here for you.

What's he talking about?

- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

Sheldon?

Hello?

- [WHISPERING] Sheldon?
- Shh!

[WHISPERING]
Penny's sleeping.

Are you insane?

You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

I had no choice.

I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

...and outside our living room
was that hallway...

...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

...there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

No, no. You gave me an explanation.

It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

[PENNY SNORING]

You might want to speak
in a lower register.

What?

Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

...so that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

That's ridiculous!

[PENNY SNORES]

[IN DEEP VOICE]
No, that's ridiculous.

[IN DEEP VOICE]
Fine.

I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

- I'm not leaving until I'm done.
- Oh, no.

If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

Oh, what the hell.

[HUMMING]

Good morning.

Morning.

I have to say I slept splendidly.

Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

I'm not surprised.

A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

...is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

Sarcasm?

You think?

Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

...but the end result
will be a measurable enhancement...

...to Penny's quality of life.

You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

For God's sake, Sheldon...

...do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

You have a sarcasm sign?

No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

You want some cereal?

I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

Hello, Honey Puffs.

PENNY:
Son of a bitch!

Penny's up.

PENNY:
You sick, geeky bastards!

How did she know it was us?

I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

...for her bedroom closet.

PENNY:
Leonard?

This is gonna be bad.

Goodbye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.

You came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

Yes, but only to clean.

Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

Give me back my key.

I'm very, very sorry.

Do you understand how creepy this is?

Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

The throat doctor.

And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

Depending on the depth...

...that's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

Oh.

- God!
- Okay, look. No, Penny...

I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...

...when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

...maybe we can talk about this.

- Stay away from me.
- Sure. That's another way to go.

Penny, Penny, hold on.

Just to clarify...

...because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...

...or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?

[DOOR SLAMS]

Well, that was a little non-responsive.

You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

[SHELDON LAUGHS]

What's funny?

That wasn't sarcasm?

- No!
- Whoo.

Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

I have a Master's and two Ph.Ds,
I should not have to do this.

What?

I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

I take full responsibility.

I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

...who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

I did what I could.

Hey, Raj.

Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

...but I'm really upset about it.

I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

RAJESH [IN VOICE-OVER]:
She's standing very close to me.

Oh, my. She does smell good.

What is that? Vanilla?

You know?

Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

What was I saying?

She's so chatty.

Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.

We'd have
the same cultural background...

...and my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.

It's obvious they meant well.

I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said...

...I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.

[RAJESH SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE
IN VOICE-OVER]

I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

...doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

Right?

She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.

That's exactly what I thought.

Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS
ON TV]

Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

It's fine. You win.

What's his problem?

His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

Been there.

Hello.

Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

Really? You?

Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?

Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

Well, she was upset at first...

...but probably
because her sister shot somebody.

Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

She hugged you? How did she hug you?

Is that her perfume I smell?

Intoxicating, isn't it?

- Hi.
- Oh.

What's going on?

Uh...

Here's the thing:

"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

...so too I regret my participation
in what was...

...at the very least, an error in judgment.

The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

...is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

...even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

Another example,
from the field of Ebola research..."

Leonard.

Yeah?

We're okay.

LEONARD: Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.

- One package Philips head screws?
- Check.

Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering...

Considering what?

How great this place looks?

- Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
- What?

These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

...of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

- It looked pretty good in the store.
- It is an inefficient design.

For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

- Good point. How will you cool it?
- Guys, I got this.

- Hang on, Penny.
- How about fans?

- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.

How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

Run some quarter-inch PVC...

Guys, this is actually really simple.

Hold on, honey, men at work.

PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

Oh, I've got it.

What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.

Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

- Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?

- Done.
- Got it.

Okay, this place does look pretty good.

[English - US - SDH]

[MUSIC PLAYS ON LAPTOPS]

All right, just a few more feet and...

Here we are, gentlemen,
the Gates of Elzebub.

SHELDON: Good Lord.
RAJESH: Oh.

Don't panic. This is what the last
97 hours have been about.

Stay frosty. There's a horde of goblins...

...on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Azeroth.

Warriors, unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders, raise your wands.

Lock and load.

Raj, blow the gates.

Blowing the gates.

Control-shift-B.

[RUMBLING AND GOBLINS
SCREAMING ON LAPTOPS]

- Oh, my God, so many goblins.
HOWARD: Aah!

Don't just stand there. Slash and move.

Stay in formation.

- Leonard, you got one on your tail.
- That's all right, my tail's prehensile.

I got him, Leonard.

Tonight, I spice my meat
with goblin blood.

Raj, it's a trap. They're flanking us.

Oh, he's got me.

Sheldon, he's got Raj.
Use your sleep spell.

Sheldon. Sheldon.

I've got the Sword of Azeroth.

- Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
- There is no more Sheldon.

I am the sword master.

- Leonard, look out.
- Damn it, man, we're dying here.

Goodbye, peasants.

[WHOOSHING ON LAPTOPS]

The bastard teleported.

He's selling the Sword of Azeroth
on eBay.

You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?

I'm a rogue knight elf.

Don't you people
read character descriptions?

Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody just clicked "Buy It Now."

I am the sword master.

Whoo! I'm all sweaty.

Wanna log on to Second Life
and go swimming?

I just built a virtual pool.

No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.

[PENNY LAUGHS]

Sounds like your neighbor's home.

Excuse me.

Don't forget the mail you took
so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.

Oh, right, right, right.

Stealing snail mail, very old school.
I like it.

Penny, the mailman did it again. He...
Oh, sorry.

Um, no, hi, Leonard. This is Doug.

- Doug, this is my neighbor, Leonard.
- What's up, bro?

Not much.

Bro. Heh.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, no. I just...
I got your mail again, here.

Oh, thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.

Oh, no, that's probably
not such a good idea.

Civil servants have a documented
propensity to, you know, snap, so...

Okay. Well, thank you again.

No problem. Bye.

Oh, and bye, bro. Heh.

Penny for your thoughts.

- What's the matter?
- No, I'm fine.

Penny's fine,
the guy she's kissing is really fine.

Kissing? What kind of kissing?
Cheeks, lips, chase, French?

What is wrong with you?

I'm a romantic.

Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation...

...is devolving into pointless jealousy.

No, I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.

Didn't like the look of the guy
she was with.

Because he looks better than you?

Yeah.

He was kind of dreamy.

At least now
you can retrieve the black box...

...from the smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her...

...and analyze the data so that
you don't crash into geek mountain again.

I disagree. Love is not a sprint.
It's a marathon.

A relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

...or hits you with the pepper spray.

No, I'm done with Penny.

I'm gonna be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

- Like who?
- I don't know.

Olivia Geiger?

The dietitian at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

- Yeah.
- Well, I don't think you have a shot there.

I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

Now, given that winter is coming,
one can assume she's signaling...

...sexual availability.

I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

- So?
- There are pitfalls.

Trust me, I know.

When it comes
to sexual-harassment law...

...I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

Howard, if I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner.

I'm not gonna walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

Oh, then you're probably okay.

- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.

- I'd like to propose an experiment...
- Goggles.

Right.

- I would like to propose an experiment.
- Hang on.

I'm trying to see how long it takes
a 500-kilowatt oxygen-iodine laser...

...to heat up my cup of noodles.

I've done it.
About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

Anyway, I was thinking more
of a biosocial exploration...

...with a neurochemical overlay.

Wait, are you asking me out?

I was going to characterize it
as the modification...

...of our colleague/friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component.

But we don't need to quibble
over terminology.

What sort of experiment
would you propose?

There is a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

I pick you up, take you to a restaurant,
then we would see a movie.

Probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents...

...of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

Interesting.

And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...

...the success or failure of the date would
be based on the biochemical reaction...

- ...during the good-night kiss?
- Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.

Why don't we stipulate
the date goes well...

...and move to the key variable?

- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.

- Define the parameters of the kiss.
- Closed mouth, but romantic.

- Mint?
- Thank you.

[MINTS CRACKING]

- Shall I count down from three?
- No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.

- What do you think?
- You proposed the experiment.

I think you should present
your findings first.

Fair enough.

On the plus side, it was a good kiss,
reasonable technique...

...no extraneous spittle.

On the other hand, no arousal.

- None?
- None.

Ah.

Well, thank you for your time.

- Thank you.
- Hmm.

None at all?

Sheldon, if you were a robot
and I knew and you didn't...

...would you want me to tell you?

That depends.

When I learn that I'm a robot,
will I be able to handle it?

Maybe, although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.

When I learn that I'm a robot...

...would I be bound by
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

You might be bound by them right now.

That's true.

- Have you ever harmed a human being?
- Of course not.

Have you ever harmed yourself,
except in cases where a human being...

...would have been endangered?

- Well, no.
- I smell robot.

- Hey, what's going on?
- Internet's been down for half an hour.

Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

So how did it go with Leslie?

Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was gonna move anyway.

Oh, I've seen that look before.

This is just gonna be two weeks
of moping and tedious emo songs...

...and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

I don't know if I can take it.

You could power down.

Well, as usual,
Wolowitz has the solution.

I happen to know a place
where there are plenty of eligible women...

...and Leonard could have his pick.

[LATIN MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

Remember the Latin hips.

Shoulders stay still and we sway.

One, two, three.

Five, six, seven.

I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

I've been there. You're in for a treat.

[SINGING]
She said, "You don't know me

You don't even care"

Oh, yeah

Oh, good Lord.

She said, "You don't know me

You don't wear my chains"

Oh, yeah

God, that's a good song.

If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

Oh, I hope that scratching post
is for you.

I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

There's a feline geneticist in San Diego...

...who's developed
the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.

- Listen...
- I've been thinking about names.

I'm kind of torn between Einstein,
Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

Do you think you can satisfy
your need for a relationship...

...with a genetically altered cat?

Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.

Oh, come on, Leonard...

This is obviously about Penny.

It doesn't matter.

The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

Okay, look. Ahem.

You have as much of a chance of having
a sexual relationship with Penny...

...as the Hubble telescope does...

...of discovering
at the center of every black hole...

...is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

Nevertheless, I do feel obligated
to point out to you...

...that she did not reject you.

You did not ask her out.

You're right.

I didn't ask her. I should ask her out.

No, no. Now, that was not my point.

My point was, don't buy a cat.

No, but you're right.

I should march over there
and ask her out.

Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.

Oh, yeah... No.

- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Good afternoon, Penny.

So, hi, hey. Uh...

I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?

There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

So to clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.

- Supper?
- Or dinner, you know.

I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.

Uh, 6:30 is great.

Really?

- Great.
- Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.

Us guys?

Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?

They...

...might all be there.

Or a subset of them might be there.

Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.

Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.

Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.

Great.

- Did we say a time?
- Six-thirty.

Still good?

- It's fine.
- It's not carved in stone.

No. Six-thirty is great.

I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

Why?

To carve the...
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.

How do I look?

Could you be more specific?

Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

- What time is your date?
- Six-thirty.

Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

- Is it too much?
- Not if you're a rugby team.

By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

...with a chicken-carbonara sub
at Quizno's.

Why would I join you?

No reason.

Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...

...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

...might lead to a nice romantic evening.

You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.

Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

You could have stopped at,
"It could go well."

If I could have, I would have.

I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.

"You love pottery? I love pottery."

You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.

She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

Is the sex starting now?

I'm having a panic attack.

Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.

If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.

- That's why they call it a panic attack.
- All right.

Would you just sit down?

- Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
- Why?

- Just do it.
- Okay.

Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

- What?
- It's a biofeedback technique.

It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

I read it
in the Journal of American Neuroscience.

It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.

I probably have it here somewhere.

Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

- You need to call her and cancel.
- Me?

- Yes.
- What should I tell her?

- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.

Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

...and haven't quite bounced back.

- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.

Why would she be expecting me?

Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

- Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
- Oh, yeah.

No.

Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.

How?

We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

So, what's new in the world of physics?

Nothing.

Really? Nothing?

Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...

...and you can't prove string theory.

At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

Oh, uh, not much.

Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

Good.

Uh, what about
your, uh, hallway friend?

Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but...

- Can I get you started with some drinks?
- No. Bzzz.

- You were saying, "But..."?
- I'd like a drink.

Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.

Okay, well, it...
I don't know. It's just me.

I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

It's just... It's my pattern.

I break up, then I find some cute guy...

...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...

Well, you know.

I'm not sure that I do. Um...

Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

...say, one glorious summer?

No. It's usually over a weekend.

And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.

Well, chafing, right?

Emotionally.

Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

Hey, do you wanna see something cool?

I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

- How?
- Physics.

Wow, centrifugal force.

Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...

...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

Excuse me.

Now, if you were biting on the olive...

...you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would...

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

Did you spill ketchup?

- No.
- I'm not okay.

You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

No, no. I'm okay.

It stopped bleeding.

Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

Yes, but I get carsick too, so...

Okay.

Sorry about your car, by the way.

Oh, no, it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

The poor guy on the bike.

I had a nice time.

Yeah, me too.

Well, um, good night.

Good night.

- Leonard.
- Yeah?

Was this supposed to be a date?

This?

No.

No, of course not.

This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

...because of work and a colonoscopy.

Okay. I was just checking.

When I take a girl on a date...
And I do, heh.

...she knows she's been dated.

Capital D. Heh.

Bold face, underlined, like, dated.

I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

Good night.

- So how was your date?
- Awesome. Heh.

Score one for liquor and poor judgment.

[English - US - SDH]

SHELDON: You know, I've been thinking
about time travel again.

Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

Put it on the back burner.

Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

...I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

- Interesting.
- Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

Sounds like a breakthrough.

Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?

It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

I guess congratulations are in order.

No, congratulations
will have been in order.

You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

LEONARD:
I know, I'm familiar with you.

SHELDON: The last party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me...

...and talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

Yes, I was there.

You know what's interesting
about caves?

- What?
- Nothing.

We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

SHELDON: How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

...despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years...

...and instead have written books...

...that reduce the great concepts
of science to anecdotes...

...each one dumbed down...

...to accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement."

[SPEAKS IN HAWAI IAN]

- "Mahalo" is a nice touch.
- Hmm.

Only eight consonants
in the Hawaiian language.

LEONARD:
Interesting, you should lead with that.

Oh, God, look at this buffet.

I love America.

- You don't have buffets in India?
- Of course, but it's all Indian food.

You can't find a bagel in Mumbai
to save your life.

Smear me.

- Well, here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

Howard brought a date?

A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

Hey, what up, science bitches?

May I introduce my special lady friend,
Summer.

Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

Right. Sorry.

Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

MAN:
Hi, fellas.

- Eric Gablehauser.
- Howard Wolowitz.

Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

An actual real scientist.

How was that?

I can't believe he fired me.

You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

...whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

Morning.

You're making eggs for breakfast?

This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

...from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-Ã -vis taste.

Sounds yummy.

I look forward to your work with bacon.

As do I.

You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

I don't want my job back.

I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

I'm not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

And we all thank you.

[DOOR CLOSES]

[SIGHS]

Use new eggs.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hi, I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

...people unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

- Four dozen should suffice.
- Four dozen?

Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

- Okay, one more time?
- Never mind, you won't get it right.

I'd better come with you.

Oh, yay.

How come
you didn't go in to work today?

I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

So you got canned, huh?

Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

But, yeah.

Maybe it's for the best.

You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens."

No, it doesn't.

Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

- Or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

Never mind.

Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

We're fine.

You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

Oh, sure I am.

No, no, let me do the math for you.

This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

- One-twenty?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

Well, yeah.

Interesting.

Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

Let's say 4390.

Fine.

We're traveling forward at...
Good Lord... 51 miles an hour.

Let's assume that your brakes are new
and the calipers are aligned.

By the time we come to a stop...

...we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and...

Oh, look,
they built a new putt-putt course.

SHELDON:
This is great.

Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people...

...just living their ordinary,
colorless, work-a-day lives.

- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

And thank you, ordinary person.

Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

No. No, not really.

Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

...knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

No, this is fun.

The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

...is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

- Hmm. Interesting.
- Isn't it?

No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

Oh, boy.

What now?

Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

...but the human body
can only absorb so much.

What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

Well, then you'll want some manganese.

Well, that was fun.

Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

I don't know, Sheldon.

It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

...one month's supply at a time.

- What?
- Well, think about it.

It doesn't spoil...

...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

Well, 30, 35...

- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

I'm not talking about this with you.

Oh, Penny.

This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle...

Are you fairly regular?

Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

[DOOR OPENS]

Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

I think it's her time of the month.

I marked the calendar
for future reference.

What's with the fish?

It's an experiment.

- What happened to your egg research?
- Oh, that was a dead end.

Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

So fish.

I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

...into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

Fish nightlights.

It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

Mum's the word.

Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to Gablehauser and get your job back?

Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

Like luminous fish.

- Shhh!
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

That's just the beginning.

I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

- Thanks for coming on such short notice.
- You did the right thing calling.

I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

Every day, he's got a new obsession.

This is a particularly disturbing one.

Mommy?

Hi, baby.

[MOUTHING]
You called my mother?

Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

- Thank you.
- Honey, why did you get a loom?

I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...

...loom."

Mom, what are you doing here?

Leonard called me.

I know, but why?

Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

I went to the market with Penny.

Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

Well, then, buckle up.

In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

Yes, well, I'm not a child.

I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

Wait, where are you going?

To my room and no one's allowed in.

[DOOR SLAMS]

- He gets his temper from his daddy.
- Ah.

- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

SHELDON:
I'm not hungry.

Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

He may stay in there till the rapture.

Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

I love the boy to death...

...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

Excuse me for being so bold...

...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

I made chicken.

I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

You know, those that needed it.

That is a lovely story.

Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

Oh, all the time.

I remember one summer
when he was 13...

...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

- Well, what happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

- A death ray?
- Well, that's what he called it.

Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

It pissed our dog off to no end.

You know, you two make a cute couple.

[BOTH LAUGH]

I... No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

Or friends.

- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

- Love?
- Lard.

- Hey, look who's com...
- Shh. You'll spook him.

He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

This is ridiculous.

Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

[DOOR SLAMS]

You don't hunt, do you?

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Good morning, Snickerdoodle.

- Morning.
- Oh.

Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

What do you want, Mom?

You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

- Yeah?
- Well, I'm done fishing.

- You put those on.
- What for?

Because you're gonna go
to your office...

...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

- No.
- I'm sorry.

Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

Now, you listen here.

I have been telling you since you were 4.

It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

- Why not?
- Because people don't like it.

Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

Now, let's get cracking.

Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

Problem solved.

Really? That's impressive.

Leonard, the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

...who are dumb as soup.

Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

Um...

As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

...when I called you an idiot.

And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

...to point it out.

I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

- Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
- Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

- Recently?
- Long enough.

Please.

Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

Okay.

Hey, how did it go?

I got my job back.

Really? What happened?

I'm not quite sure.

It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

Well, that narrows it down.

I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

Thanks, Mom.

- Mom?
- Mm-hm.

Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

We'll see. Sleep tight.

[English - US - SDH]

All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

...augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

...and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.

Plus Superman and Godzilla.

No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

Superman is vulnerable to magic.

Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

...to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on.

Shiva and Ganesh?

The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?

And orcs.

I'll be back.

Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...

...and drinking mint juleps.

My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

...from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

A shower.

I'll take the heart-smart platter.

All right, thank you. And Sheldon?

We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

- Well, it's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

...the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

Can't we just go to Big Boy?

- They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
- The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.

In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...

...why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?

Because you are not at Big Boy.

- Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
- Make it two.

Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

- I didn't know you ate here.
- We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

So I'm glad I ran into you.

The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

What happened to Elliott Wong?

Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

- So are you in?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

- We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
- Why at my place?

Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

...and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

...wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

- ...so...
- Really?

[BEATBOXING]

I'm actually not that into music.

Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?

Leslie?

No, no. What, are you kidding?

He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

Thank you, Sheldon.

I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

- Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?

She didn't take my order.

How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

LEONARD: What did Penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?

I assume she meant
the two of you...

...would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

Aren't they adorable?"

If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

...then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

...indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

...and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

...then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.

"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple."

But while thinking,
"Good, Leonard remains available."

You're a lucky man, Leonard.

How so?

You're talking to one of
the three men in the West...

...capable of following
that train of thought.

Well, what do you think?

I said I could follow it,
I didn't say I cared.

[PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC]

I admire your fingering.

Thank you.

Maybe sometime you can
try that on my instrument.

LESLIE: Good night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

See you next week.

- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

Sure. Why not?

[STARTS PLAYING]

Just so we're clear, you understand
me hanging back to practice with you...

...is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

[CLATTERING]

Really?

Yeah, I'm good to go.

I thought you weren't interested in me.

That was before I saw you handling that
beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

You mean my cello.

No, I mean the obvious,
crude double entendre.

I'm seducing you.

No kidding.

What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

So how about it?

Gee...

- Is it the waitress?
- Penny? What about her?

I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

...which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...

...which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

...but certainly not dilate my pupils...

...so I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

- You and the waitress, then.
- No, no.

There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

So you're open to a sexual relationship?

Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

- Good.
- Yeah, it is.

It is good.

Did you wanna start now?

- Why don't we finish this section first?
- Oh, okay.

A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

[RESUMES PLAYING]

[PLAYING FASTER]

- I'm... Good to go.
- Me too.

Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What's going on?

I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

- I'm sorry?
- Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.

It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaining yourself...

...but you're really not.

Just come with me.

[ON STEREO]
Tell me have you ever really

Really, really ever loved a woman?

Well?

- Well, what?
- What does it mean?

Come on, you went to college.

Yes, but I was 11.

A tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't wanna be disturbed...

...because they're, you know,
getting busy.

So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?

Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

LESLIE [FLATLY]:
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

We really shouldn't be standing here.

This is very awkward.

Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?

Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.

You know, last time, I was able to book
a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

So do you know who's in there?

Well, there's Leonard.

And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

Hmm. Good for him.

Good for Leonard.

Okay. Night.

No, don't. Wait, hold on.

- What's the matter?
- I don't know what the protocol is here.

Do I stay? Do I leave?

Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

Gee, Sheldon,
you're asking the wrong girl.

I'm usually on the other side
of the tie.

[DOOR CLOSES]

[DIALING]

Hi, Leonard?

It's me.

Sheldon.

In the living room.

I just...
I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

Message received.

You're welcome.

You carry on. Give my best to Leslie.

Big Boy.

[EXHALES]

[CLEARS THROAT]

Someone touched my board.

Oh, God, my board.

[PANTING]
Leonard.

Leonard!

Hey, what's the matter?

Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.

- Are you sure?
- Of course.

Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

The sign's been changed.

Oh, yeah.

But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

Are you...? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.

You're welcome.

You did this?

Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.

Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

Pretty cool, huh?

"Cool"?

Listen, I gotta get to the lab.

Thanks for a great night.

Thank you. I'll see you at work.

- Hold on. Hold on.
- What?

- Who told you you could touch my board?
- No one.

I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

Oh, that is so, so...

I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you
come up with an adjective, text me.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.

You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.

SHELDON:
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hi.

[TEASING]
So how's it going?

[IMITATES PENNY]
Pretty good.

Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.

"Pretty, very." There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.

Why do you ask?

Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

- Sheldon!
SHELDON: I'm coming.

So is it serious? Do you like her?

I don't...

That's really two different questions.
I'm not...

Sheldon, we have to go.

Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

Thank you.

[DOOR CLOSES]

What did she mean, she's happy for me?

Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

...even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

You know, because the second person,
though happy...

...is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

You know what?

I'm being ridiculous.

But who cares what Penny thinks?

Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

She's extremely intelligent.

SHELDON: She's not that intelligent.
LEONARD: She fixed your equation.

SHELDON: She got lucky.
LEONARD: You don't believe in luck.

I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

...with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

...with the woman
who is currently making me happy.

SHELDON: Leonard.
LEONARD: Yeah?

SHELDON:
I still don't care.

Hey, Leslie.

Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

Brrrr. Heh.

Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

So anyway, hello.

What are you doing?

Just extending the intimacy.

Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

...and share a decontamination shower?

Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

The difference between us and the rat...

...is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

That's where you come in.

Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

So, what happens now?

Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

Oh.

Okay.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

- You wanna make plans for New Year's?
- Please, you're smothering me.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

Doctor what?

The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

...making the bang, bang music.

- Well, how did it get on the Internet?
- I put it there.

Well, how did you know about it?

A little bird told us.

Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

Well, that part's true.

I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

- No kidding.
- I don't wanna go out on a limb...

...but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

Way ahead of you.

I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.

- Really?
- Yeah.

The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

You can't grow soup.

- So how's everything?
- Terrific.

You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

I don't know, a psychiatrist?

PENNY:
So, hey.

- How are things with you and Leslie?
- Oh.

To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

Well, what did she mean by that?

Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

- Are you even listening to me?
- Of course I'm listening.

Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

Okay, then.

You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.

[English - US - SDH]

Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

We really suck at paintball.

HOWARD:
That was absolutely humiliating.

LEONARD: Oh, come on. Some battles
you win, some battles you lose.

HOWARD: Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

...and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

Sheldon, let it go.

No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

I was giving clear, concise orders.

You hid behind a tree yelling:

"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

Okay. Um...

I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

- A party?
- Yeah.

A boy-girl party?

There will be boys
and there will be girls...

...and it is a party, so...

Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

- Dancing?
- Yeah.

- I don't know, Penny...
- Thing is, we're not...

- We're really more of a...
- No.

But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

Are you sure? It's Halloween.

A Halloween party?

As in costumes?

Well, yeah.

Is there a theme?

Um, yeah, Halloween.

Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

As usual, I'm not following.

He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

- ...fantasy...
- Sure.

- Comic books?
- Fine.

- Anime?
- Of course.

TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods...

Anything you want.

Okay? Any costume you want.

Bye.

Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

[KNOCKING]

LEONARD:
I'll get it.

Psshoo.

Oh, no.

SHELDON:
Oh, no.

Make way for the fastest man alive.

Oh, no.

See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

We all have other costumes.
We can change.

Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

It'll look like one person
going really fast.

No, no, no.

It's a boy-girl party,
this Flash runs solo.

Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.

We all change. Agreed?

ALL:
Agreed.

I call Frodo!

ALL:
Damn.

Hey.

Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

- You went with Thor?
- What?

Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a Norse god?

No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian god.

That's racism.

I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
- Really?

Because I saw Peter Pan
and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

- No, it's not that...
- If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

Terrific. Um...

This party is my first chance for Penny...

...to see me in the context
of her social group...

...and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

...for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

...a potential close friend
and perhaps more.

I don't wanna look like a dork.

Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

...I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

Oh, hey, guys.

Hey, sorry we're late.

Late? It's 7:05.

And you said the party starts at 7.

Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

It's 7:05.

Yes, yes, it is.

Okay, well, um, come on in.

What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

Probably, but in their own homes.

So, what time
does the costume parade start?

The parade?

Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

Most frightening, most authentic...

...most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

...but there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

This party is just going to suck.

No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

That's so cute.

- Actually, Penny, he's Robin...
- I'm Peter Pan.

And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

No, you don't.

- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

...caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

Okay.

See? People get it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[CHATTERING]

Mm. By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex Mix.

No, thanks. Peanuts.

I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

I'm confused.

If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

We're socializing, meeting new people.

Telepathically?

- Oh, hey. When did you get here?
WOMAN: Hi.

Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

And that includes Halle Berry's.

She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

...which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.

She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

Where do you get this stuff?

You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

And there's this great show on VH1
about how to pick up girls.

Oh, if only I had his confidence.

I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

...or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

If that's a working stethoscope...

...maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat.

No, thanks.

No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

[UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIANTS'
"GOT NOTHING" PLAYS ON STEREO]

So take my money

Take my money

I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just...

I don't know
how to talk to these people.

- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?

Like Jane Goodall observing the apes...

...I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

But patterns emerge.

They have their own language,
if you will.

Go on.

Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

...with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

Which is met
with an approving chorus of "Dude."

Then what happens?

That's as far as I've gotten.

This is ridiculous.

- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

No, you're coming with me.

Oh, I hardly think so.

Come on.

- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.

All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

...I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

Oh, hi.

- Hi.
- Hello.

So, what are you supposed to be?

Me?

I'll give you a hint.

Vroom.

A choo-choo train?

Close.

Vroom.

A brain-damaged choo-choo train?

How wasted am I?

Dancing all by myself

Cannot control the beat
When you make me weak

Vroom.

[UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIANTS'
"MAMA'S ROOM" PLAYS ON STEREO]

I still don't get it.

I'm the Doppler effect.

Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

...I think it's very insensitive.

Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

Because I'm Frodo.

Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

- Oh, no.
- What?

That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

What do you suppose he's doing here?

Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha.

So I guess we'll be leaving now.

Why should we leave?

For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

You have a backup hypothesis?

Maybe they just wanna be friends.

Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

Then he and I are on equal ground.

Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

...Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

...pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

No.

I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

Face to face?

Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

Given the reaction to my costume...

...this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

What? You're a zebra, right?

Yet another child left behind.

And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

No, I'm a hobbit.

What's the difference?

A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

...whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

I think we're all talking to Penny here.

I'm not. No offense.

Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

Oh, I am being nice.

Right, little buddy?

- Kurt.
- Okay.

I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

...and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

You calling me a puffy animal?

Oh, of course not.

No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

No, I said animalistic.

Of course, we're all animals...

...but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

If he understands that, you're in trouble.

So what? I'm unevolved?

You're in trouble.

You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

Okay, Kurt, please.

Look, Penny, it's okay.

I can handle this.

I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

A hobbit.

Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus
preventing the conversion...

...from short-term to long-term memory?

[UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIANTS'
"MEANINGLESS LOVE" PLAYS ON STEREO]

Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

A Homo habilis discovering
his opposable thumbs says, "What?"

- What?
- Ha-ha.

I think I've made my point.

Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

Let me remind you, while my moral support
is absolute, in a physical confrontation...

...I will be less than useless.

There's not going to be a confrontation.

In fact, I doubt
if he can even spell confrontation.

C-O-N...

Frontation.

- Kurt, put him down this instant.
- He started it.

I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.

Fine.

You're one lucky little leprechaun.

He's a hobbit.

I got your back.

Leonard, are you okay?

Yeah, no, I'm fine.

I can't afford you

It's a good party. Thanks for having...
It's just getting a little late, so...

Oh. Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for coming.

I had nothing to do with

Happy Halloween.

If it's any consolation...

...I thought that Homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

- What's that?
- Tea.

When people are upset...

...the cultural convention
is to bring them hot beverages.

There, there.

You wanna talk about it?

- No.
- Good.

"There, there" was really all I had.

- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey, Leonard?
- Hi, Penny.

Hey, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

I'm fine.

I am so sorry about what happened.

It's not your fault.

Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

He always does stuff like that.

So why was he at your party?

Well, I ran into him last week...

...and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

And I know you don't wanna hear this. I'm
upset and really drunk and I just wanna...

[SOBBING]

There, there.

God, what is wrong with me?

Nothing, you're perfect.

Ecch. I'm not perfect.

Yes, you are.

You really think so, don't you?

- Penny?
- Yeah?

How much have you had
to drink tonight?

Just... a lot.

Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

...doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

It might.

[SIGHS]

Boy, you're really smart.

Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

Leonard, you are so great.

Why can't all guys be like you?

Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

I should probably go.

Probably.

Thank you.

That's right, you saw what you saw.

That's how we roll in the Shire.

[KNOCKING]

SHELDON:
Coming.

Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

He's not here.

Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

Thank you for the clarification.

- I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

He has his hammer.

Wow.

I have to say, you are an amazing man.

You're gentle and passionate.

And, my God,
you are such a good listener.

[English - US - SDH]

Watch this, it's really cool. Ahem.

Call Leonard Hofstadter.

WOMAN [ON MACHINE]:
Did you say, "Call Helen Boxleitner"?

No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.

Did you say, "Call Temple Beth Seder"?

- No.
- Here, let me try.

Call M'kflono M'kflooniloo. Ha-ha. Ha.

Calling Rajesh Koothrappali.

[PHONE RINGING]

Oh. It's very impressive.

And a little racist.

If we're through playing
Mock the Flawed Technology...

...can we get on with "Halo" night?

We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

So we'll start now.

We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

...will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

We could split it two, two and two.

If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

What fresh hell is this?

- Hey, Penny. Come on in.
- Hey, guys.

See a Penny, pick her up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck.

No, you won't. Uh...

- Can I hide out here for a while?
- Sure. What's going on?

Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"

And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

- Eight oh eight.
- Shh.

She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

...yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

...you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.

So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

...so she's kind of family.

Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...

...with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.

I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

This one time, she was at...

Where's Howard?

HOWARD:
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

I understand you're new in town.

Oh, good grief.

[SLOW COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING]

Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.

And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...

...but on a more serious note,
it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo."

Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.

Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

- Great idea.
- Uh, no.

The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

This is a notion,
and a rather sucky one at that.

- Why?
- Why? Oh...

- Penny, Penny, Penny.
- What, what, what?

This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...

...not to mention an intricate back-story.

[EXPLOSION ON TV]

Oh, cool!
Whose head did I just blow off?

Mine.

Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.

It's the only way we can play teams.

Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung
by her lack of experience, not to mention...

[EXPLOSION ON TV]

Ha-ha! There goes your head again.

Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

You need to give them a chance to...
Now, come on.

[EXPLOSION ON TV]

Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered.
Cover me.

Cover this, suckers.

[CHUCKLING]

Penny, you are on fire.

Yeah, and so is Sheldon.

[LAUGHING]

Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

No one can be that attractive
and this skilled at a video game.

Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.

What?

This plasma grenade.

[EXPLOSION ON TV]

Ha! Look, it's raining you.

You laugh now,
you just wait until you need tech support.

Gosh. He's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

Well, to be fair,
he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

Well, it's been fun.

Penny, we make such a good team.

Maybe we could enter
a couple of "Halo" tournaments sometime.

Or we could just have a life.

I guess for you, that's an option.
Ha-ha. Ha.

- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

As usual, nice talking to you, Raj.

What do you suppose she meant by that?

She's an enigma, Raj.

There's a certain ethic to the game,
Penny, a well-established...

She's gone, Sheldon.

Well, she could have said goodbye.

Okay, I have a problem.

It's called carpal tunnel syndrome,
and quite frankly, you deserve it.

What's wrong?

Well, um, Howard and Christy
are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

- Are you sure?
- Look, I grew up on a farm, okay?

From what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.

Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

No. Yeah, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.

Hypoallergenic.

Uh, the couch is good.

Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment.

You have a problem with this.

Where do I begin?

It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

Well, first, we don't have house guests.

Frankly, if I could afford the rent,
I'd ask you to leave.

Your friendship means a lot
to me as well. What else?

Well, our earthquake supplies.

- We have a two-man, two-day kit.
- So?

So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

...we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

...we might succumb to cannibalism?

No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

- Ha. What?
- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

I suggest no liquids after 11p.m.

- Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.

Heh, wrong.

I'm listening.

Your head goes on the other end.

- Why?
- It's culturally universal.

A bed, even a temporary bed...

...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

- I'll risk it.
- Ooh.

Anything else I should know?

Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

FYI, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

- Ha. Got it.
- Well, sleep tight.

Thanks.

Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

It refers to
the early construction of beds...

...which featured a mattress suspended
on interlocking ropes, which occasionally...

Sleep tight.

What are you doing?

Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

...poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

...sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

Penny's still sleeping.

Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

...I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself...

I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

What time is it?

Almost 6:30.

I slept all day?

No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

What the hell is your problem?

Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

Hola, nerd-migos.

Why do you people hate sleep?

Are you wearing my robe?

Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

That's okay, keep it.

- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.

By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

You used my loofah?

More precisely, we used your loofah.

I exfoliated her brains out.

You can keep that too.

Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

CHRISTY: Howard?
- In here, milady.

Mm. There's my little engine that could.

[IMITATING TRAIN]

There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

Hi. Christy.

- Hey, Leonard.
- I'm Sheldon.

Right. You're Howard's entourage.

So, Christy, what are your plans?

Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

Let me offer a little thinking here.

- Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.

I do not. My mother lives with me.

It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?

- Sheldon, you just can't dictate...
- No more talking. Everybody go.

So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

What is that, like a Mexican deli?

I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

My last name is Wolowitz.

Oh. That's so cool.

My first Jew.

I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

- But you're still taking me shopping?
- Anything you want.

Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

Howard, can't you see she's using you?

Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Yay.

If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

Let me walk you through it.

Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

Do you see the problem?

I see a problem.

Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrÃ©es...

...divided amongst four people.

So we'll just order three entrÃ©es.

Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

- And who gets the extra dumpling?
- We could cut it into thirds.

Then it's no longer a dumpling.

Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

Hi, fellas.

Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

I come from Sacramento.

Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

No substitutions.

This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

Okay. No reductions.

Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

- That's 12, we'll each have four.
- That works.

If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrÃ©e.

No eliminations.

If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.

Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

Can we please make a decision?

Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

Oh, ew.

You're nice boys.

Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

When I'm walking over to the table...

...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

No one has to know.

I'll know.

[SPEAKING IN CHINESE]

- How about soup?
- Yeah, we can always divide soup.

What about the won tons?

Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

It's "Halo" night.

Yeah? Okay.

So?

With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy...

She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

...we had something
we wanted to ask you.

- Sheldon?
- Yes. Ahem.

Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

Oh. That's so sweet.

But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.

Then it's not dancing night.

Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

All right, fellas, I gotta go.

But good luck.

Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

...there are three of us and two of them.

- So?
- It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

- Who are you calling?
- The only man who can restore...

...any semblance of balance
to our universe.

HOWARD [ON RECORDING]:
This is Howard.

CHRISTY [ON RECORDING]
This is Christy.

HOWARD: We can't get to the phone
right now because we're having sex.

CHRISTY: You're not gonna put that
on your message, are you?

HOWARD:
I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

[BEEPS]

Sheldon, think this through.

You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "Halo."

No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

My point.

CHRISTY: I'm just saying you can take the
damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Why, so you
and Howard can hump on it?

HOWARD: Ladies, ladies,
I'm sure there's a middle ground.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Shut up, Howard!
CHRISTY: Shut up, Howard!

HOWARD: You guys talk.
I'm gonna take my scooter out for a spin.

CHRISTY: You happy?
You drove your son out of the house.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Why don't you stop butting in?

- What are you guys doing here?
- It's "Halo" night.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
He's not a man, he's a putz.

And don't you take that tone with me,
you gold digger.

CHRISTY: What'd you call me?
MRS. WOLOWITZ: You heard me.

You're barking up the wrong tree...

...because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

CHRISTY: You know what?
I got better offers. I'm out of here.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: That's right.
Go back to Babylon, you whore.

So "Halo" night, huh?

- I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
- Shh.

[GUNFIRE ON TV]

Sheldon, you got him in your sights. Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle.

- I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
- Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.

I can't see him.

That's why they call it cloaking,
dead man.

- Start throwing grenades.
- I'm all out.

Hey, guys, my friends and I
got tired of dancing...

...so we came over to have sex
with you.

Now, Raj, jump in the tank.

- We said no tanks.
- There are no rules in hell.

Son of a bitch.
Med-pack! I need a med-pack!

Told you.

There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher.

All I've got is a needler
and I'm all out of ammo!

And now you're out of life.

[SOUNDS ON TV STOP]

- Why did you hit pause?
- I thought I heard something.

- What?
- No... Never mind.

Sorry, go.

[English - US - SDH]

Damn you, WalletNook.com.

Problem?

The online description
was completely misleading.

They said eight slots plus removable ID.

To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.

But they don't tell you,
the removable ID takes up one slot.

It's a nightmare.

Okay, now, do you really need...

...the honorary Justice League
of America membership card?

It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was 5.

Why?

It says, "Keep this on your person
at all times."

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

It's right here, under Batman's signature.

And this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

[CHUCKLES]
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi,
Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali?

Hi.

Tilt up the camera.
I'm looking at his crotch.

Sorry, Papa.

- Oh, that's much better. Hi.
- Hi.

- And over here is Sheldon.
SHELDON: Hi.

He lives with Leonard.

Oh, that's nice. Like Haroon and Tanvir.

No, not like Haroon and Tanvir.

MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Such sweet young men.

They just adopted
the cutest little Punjabi baby.

Yeah. No, we're not
like Haroon and Tanvir.

- So are you boys academics like our son?
- Yes.

Your parents are comfortable
with limited earning potential?

- Oh, yes.
- Not at all.

Papa, please don't start.

What? It's just a question.
He's so sensitive.

That's my life, my friends.
Good to see you. Say bye.

- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

DR. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Wait, wait.

Before you go, we have good news.

Put the computer down
and gather your friends.

- What is it, Papa?
- I don't see your friends.

Is it just me or does web-chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?

Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?

The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at USC...

...so we gave her
your contact information.

Why did you do that?

You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.

- But, Papa, I'm not supposed...
- Lalita's parents approved the match.

If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.

A spring wedding?

It's up to you. We don't want to meddle.

If you don't want to meddle,
why are you meddling?

Your parents
don't consider this meddling.

While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm...

...Indian parents continue to have
an involvement in their children's love lives.

Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

You seemed confused.

- Sorry, but with all due respect, I don't...
- I'm sorry, darling. We have to go.

Doogie Howser is on.

Grandma, it's Doogie time.

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

I don't believe it.

Neither do I.

Doogie Howser's been off the air
for like 20 years.

Actually, I read that it's one of
the most popular programs in India.

Might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.

LEONARD:
I bet you're right.

- I bet they love Scrubs.
- What's not to love?

Excuse me, hello?

My parents are trying to marry me off
to a stranger. What am I going to do?

- I suggest you go through with it.
- What?

Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.

It's the premise of Fiddler on the Roof.

I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.

Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.

Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

Let's not forget
it's got some really catchy tunes.

- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

- I know what I'm gonna do.
- What?

Find new friends.

[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

- So who wants to rent Fiddler?
- No need. We have the special edition.

Well, maybe we are like
Haroon and Tanvir.

This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Yeah, I need to cancel my membership
to the planetarium.

[LAUGHING NOISELESSLY]

Yeah, well, I'm sorry too...

...but there's just no room
for you in my wallet.

No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History...

...and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.

Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.

Okay, I know you're texting about me
and I'd really like you to stop.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.

I thought you were finding new friends.

I've got some feelers out.

In the meantime, listen to this.

[ON RECORDING]
Hi, Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta.

Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.

So I'm calling you and call me back.

Bye.

Can you believe how pushy she is?

So don't call her.

If I don't call her,
I won't hear the end of it.

- So call her.
- How can I call her? I can't talk to women.

I'm done. Anybody else?

[GRUNTS]

- Give me the phone.
- Why?

Just give it to me. Sh.

- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, you'll thank me.

[IMITATING RAJESH]
Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali.

[LAUGHING]

Yes, it is good to talk to you too.

So, what are you wearing?

Oh, not important.

So anyhow,
when would you like to meet?

Friday works for me.

I'll call you with a time and place.

In the meantime, keep it real, babe.

[NORMAL VOICE]
You may now thank me.

For what, making me sound
like a Simpsons character?

- Next time, make your own date.
- Didn't wanna make this one.

Look on the bright side, she might
turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.

Great, we get married,
I won't be able to talk to her...

...and we'll spend the rest of our lives
in total silence.

It worked for my parents.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.

I need guinea pigs.

Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in Reseda you could try.

But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.

Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

I swear to God, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.

His mom's been saying that for years.

- What's up?
- Well, I convinced the restaurant...

...to give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

With certain obvious exceptions.

Suicide, for example.

So, Leonard, how about it?

Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now.

And besides, he doesn't drink, so...

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

Really?

Um...

Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.

Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...

...interact in a cylindrical container.

Thank you.

Okay, Raj, what'll it be?

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

Whatever you recommend.

How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

Okay? Good, coming up.

- Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
- I'll have a Diet Coke.

Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.

That's rum and Coke without the rum.

Yes.

So Coke.

Yes.

And would you make it diet?

There's a can in the fridge.

A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

Then swim to Cuba.

Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

Okay. Raj, here you go.

All right. Who's next?

I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

Okay, you're cut off.

Anybody need a refill?

Where did my life go, Penny?

One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...

...and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.

Are you talking to me?

Is there another Penny here?

I had such plans. I had dreams.

I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

But with a penis, of course.

It's amazing.

Ever since I was a little boy...

...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

It's time for a showdown.

Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.

Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

It's about to tell my parents...

...that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

Okay, calm down.

No one can make you get married.

Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?

Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

- Raj...
- No, no, let's see how long it takes him.

Raj, honey...

...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

And now we'll never know.

You're right. I...

I am talking to you.

Hello, Penny. How are you?

I'm fine.

Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

...before I meet the Grasshopper.

It's a sweet green miracle.

If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

Overdo what?

Happiness?

Freedom?

This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

Yeah, that.

Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

Okay.

What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

It worked for my parents.

[PLAYING SLOW MUSIC ON PIANO]

I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

Well, you are.

Little Lalita.

That's kind of fun to say.

Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

You have lost so much weight.

That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

Do you remember?

- Yes, I do.
- Of course you do.

Who could forget being that fat?

Well, I've been trying.

- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

Yay, me.

Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

Drinks do not work that way.

I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

So how's Koothrappali...?

Oh, my Lord.

- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.

Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

It's a children's story.

Oh, no, it isn't.

When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

...my mother would read it.

It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

I know the reason.

We all know the reason.

Sheldon, what are you getting at?

That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

Every year at Comic-Con.

Every day at Disneyland.

You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

Isnât it great? She isn't fat anymore.

Forgive me, Your Highness...

...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

I'm sorry?

You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

Oh.

Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

- You Indian.
- Oh.

The resemblance is remarkable.

I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

Well, thanks.

I imagine you smell very nice too.

I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

Really? So do I.

But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

Oh, my.

- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

I'm not hitting on her.

And I am not your lady.

And you have no wrath.

You are my lady. Our parents said so.

We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

Let's get something straight.

The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

- Screw Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

But you're not Princess Panchali.

Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

- Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.

Let's go.

What just happened?

Beats the hell out of me.

I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI: What are we
supposed to say to Lalita's parents?

I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.

Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, Papa.

Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.

Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

- This is a family matter, Sheldon.
- No, I'm Leonard.

Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.

But he's right, Papa. Listen to him.

[DOOR OPENS]

You, you are the one
who ruined everything.

Who is it? We can't see.

Turn us. Turn us.

Go ahead, tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.

How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?

Yes, Mommy.

You know what happens to the samosas
when you wear the tighty whities.

Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?

- Sheldon, tell them what you did.
- What did I do?

You left with his date.

Friends don't do that to each other.

Oh.

All right, noted.

- Sorry.
- "Sorry"? That's all you can say is "sorry"?

Take it, Raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

And may I point out...

...she wouldn't have asked me to go
if you weren't drunk and boring.

- Drunk?
- And boring. Her words.

I knew it, he moves to America
and becomes an alcoholic.

I'm not an alcoholic.

Then why were you drunk?

It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.

Are you in denial? Do we have
to come over and do an intervention?

Don't embarrass him
in front of his friends.

All right. Carry us outside.

We want to talk to you in private.

- But, Papa, please...
- Now, Rajesh.

I have to go.

DR. KOOTHRAPPALI: Now, listen to me...
- At least wait till I get into the hall.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Okay, well, good night.

Hold on.

What happened with you and Lalita?

We ate, she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks...

...nothing I didn't already know,
and I came home.

So you're not gonna see her again?

Why would I see her again?

I already have a dentist.

I wonder who's gonna tell his parents
that they're not having grandchildren.

[SINGING AND PLAYING "TO LIFE"]

To life, to life, l'chaim

L'chaim, l'chaim, to life

Life has a way of amusing us

I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?

Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba Libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty.

[CHUCKLES]
You didn't.

Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.

To life

[VOCALIZING]

[English - US - SDH]

Okay.

The X Tens are online.

Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...

...racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

...bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...

...terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia...

...and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP...

...and the external receiver attached

Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

- Are we ready on the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

- Hey, guys.
LEONARD & SHELDON: Hello.

It's a little loud.

No problem. Turning it down.

San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax:

VoilÃ .

Okay, thanks.

Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?

Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.

No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at RadioShack.

They're really cheap.

No. You don't get it.

Howard, enable public access.

Public access enabled.

- Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.
- No, hang on.

[ALL GASP]

See?

No.

Someone in Sichuan Province, China...

...is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.

Huh. Well, that's handy.

Um, here's a question. Why?

ALL:
Because we can.

Oh! They found the remote-control cars.

- But wait, wait, what's on top of them?
- Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...

...and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

You may wanna put on slacks.

What?

Ew! Stop it. No. Leave me alone.

[DOOR SLAMS]

- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...

...we're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.

I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

Eight feet tall and ripped.

I'm with you. I just have to make sure
if I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.

I promised my mother.

I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.

That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.

Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.

Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

Well, there's always the possibility...

...that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

...but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.

They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...

...at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.

I know. I read it before I threw it out.

Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

...why did you throw it out?

Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...

...in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...

...who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

Which, if I were there, it would be.

I don't know, Sheldon.

Those Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein
Condensates parties are legendary.

Forget the parties.

Forget the parties? What a nerd.

Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?

Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?

Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...

...is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.

I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed...

Shut up, Howard.

- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

...and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

Everything else is optional.

Okay, let me put it this way: I'm doing it.

You can't. I'm the lead author.

Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

I let you think we went alphabetically...

...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

You're welcome.

Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

It doesn't need proving.

So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

They're not supposed to,
but they should.

I don't care what you say.

I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

And I forbid it.

You forbid it?

If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

- So you admit that it's our work?
- No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

And once again, you are welcome.

[SCOFFS]

Oh, no, he didn't.

So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

...where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?

Like: Bzz-phew!

Never mind.

How about this one?

It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."

Oh.

Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

They don't. That's why I saved this one.

Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

- ...and these.
- Is this stuff you want me to try on?

No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

What's this?

That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

Uh-huh.

You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

...and then rescued by Superman.

Oh, nice.

It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

- Great, be right back.
- Where are you going? Put them on.

- Here?
- Oh, are you shy?

- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry, I won't look.

I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

- Sweetie, put the pants on.
- I'm gonna put them on.

So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

...on this presentation thing?

No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

What is this?

Oh, careful.

That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

Okay, all right. Moving on.

Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

Is this your only tie?

Ah, technically, yes.

But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

So it works as two.

Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

- Is this all your clothes?
- Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

The eighth grade?

My last growth spurt.

Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

- Great.
- Yup.

I said no. Put it down.

[KEYS JINGLING]

Hey, Sheldon.

Hello, Penny.

Get anything good?

Just the latest copy
of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.

Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

It was a joke.

Heh-heh.

Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

To save you from further awkwardness...

...know that I'm comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

Put it in your pocket.

- So you and Leonard...
- Oh, dear God.

Little misunderstanding, huh?

A little misunderstand...?

Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

...and I think he feels really bad about it.

SHELDON:
Huh.

Well, how do you feel?

I don't understand the question.

Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

...of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

PENNY:
Wait, what?

I couldn't poop this morning.

You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

- It's certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

A powerful laxative.

Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

I know Leonard values you as a friend.

He told me without your little idea...

...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

Excuse me. Little idea?

Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

In what words, then, exactly?

The exact words aren't really...

- It's more the spirit in which...
- What did he say?

You had a lucky hunch.

I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

Don't you ever speak to me again.

What...?

Oh, he:

Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

- Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
- Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

- Why did you say it?
- I don't know...

- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all.

A little bit.

How did that work out for you?

Leonard, ready to go?

Libido, one. Truth, zero.

I'm gonna ask one more time.

We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

Let's go.

- Bye, Sheldon.
- Goodbye, Penny.

[GRUNTS]

One of these days: Phew!

There you go.

You're right, this side does look better.

No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

- You're kidding.
- Is that all?

All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

Oh. Well, then, good.

I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.

- It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
- Okay, joke. Okay.

How about this? Um, okay.

There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

...but they won't lay any eggs.

So he calls a physicist to help.

The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."

[ALL LAUGHING]

Right?

Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

- Let's roll.
- Okay.

- Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

I really should've brought my own car.

So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

...the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

...which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

Thank you.

- Are there any questions?
MAN: Yeah.

What the hell was that?

Any other questions?

Dr. Sheldon Cooper here.
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

Thank you.

And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

...where I was walking through
the park...

...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

Was that just an anecdote?

- You are not Isaac Newton.
- No, no, that's true.

Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

You cannot be that arrogant.

You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

- No offense.
- Really? So why did you come?

- Because I knew you'd screw this up.
- I didn't screw it up.

Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

- Thank you.
- It was straight downhill from there.

I've had enough of your condescension.

Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

No offense.

And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

...and has an ego
in need of constant validation.

- So you admit you're an egotist.
- Yes.

My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

...so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

But he's worse!

Okay, that is it.

Stop it.

You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

- Stop it.
- You hit me.

You saw that. He hit me.

- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.

It wasn't... It was not...
You are a nutcase.

We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.

Stop it. Stop it.

Quit it.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Is this usually
how these physics things go?

More often than you'd think.

Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

- No pinches. No...!
- No!

[LOCK CLICKING]

You could have offered me a ride home.

You're lucky I didn't run you over.

I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

Excuse me.

Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

Yes. Ahem.

I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

It was uncalled for.

You won't believe this.

Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

What?

- Now, who would do that?
- That would be me.

Check it out. It's a featured video.

You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.

- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.

- It was not... You are a nutcase.
- We'll see about that.

You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.

Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

- Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.
- No pinches. No...!

You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.

Oh, jeez.

Does this suit really look that bad?

Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

...why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

"Me and my girlfriend"?

Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

- He hit me.
- You tried to blow up my head.

- So it was working.
- It was not... You are a nutcase.

We'll see about that.

[IN MANDARIN]

[English - US - SDH]

No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by Skynet...

...and Skynet was developed
by Miles Dyson...

...but that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.

Okay, then riddle me this.

Assuming all the good terminators...

...were originally evil terminators
created by Skynet...

...then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would Skynet...

...an artificial computer intelligence...

...bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

- All right, wait. They use it to lure...
- Eh! Too late, I win.

[PENNY SINGING "OUT TONIGHT"]

Let's go out tonight

I have to go out tonight

What the hell is that?

I don't know. But if cats could sing...

...they'd hate it too.

PENNY [SINGING]:
You wanna prowl

Be my night owl?
Well, take my...

Hey, guys.

- Hi, where are you going?
- What?

We just had to mail some letters.

And throw away some chicken.

You'll never guess what just happened.

- I give up.
- I don't guess.

As a scientist, I reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation.

Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

...rendering my response moot.

- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth.

What happened?

Remember when I auditioned for Rent but
I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?

I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

No, you don't.

No, he doesn't.

The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped
out and they asked me to replace her.

- Oh! Congratulations, what a lucky break.
- It's not a big deal.

Just one night,
but they invite casting people and agents.

So you never know.

- I think I know.
- No, you don't.

- He doesn't.
- It's this Friday at 8, you guys wanna come?

- No.
- No.

Because Friday,
we are attending a symposium...

...on molecular positronium.

- I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6.
- No, it's this Friday.

- At 8.
- Oh, too bad.

- I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.
- See you.

PENNY [SINGING]:
Let's go out tonight

- You just lied to Penny.
- Yes, I did.

And you did it so casually.

No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

- So?
- So lack of a physiological response...

...while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

That's very true.

Leonard?

Leonard?

- Leonard?
LEONARD: What?

I need to speak to you.

- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's important.

I highly doubt that.

Go away.

Are you still out there?

Yes.

What?

You're right, it can wait until morning.

LEONARD: What, what, what?
- Never mind.

I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

- You're in no state of mind to talk.
- Sheldon, what is it?

I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to Penny.

- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth.

That would have hurt her feelings.

Is that a relevant factor?

Yes.

Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

And what would I have said afterwards?

I would suggest something
to the effect of:

"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

...and if you disagree, I recommend
a CAT scan to look for a tumor...

...pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain."

I couldn't say that.

I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again."

Why?

It's the social protocol.

It's what you do...

...when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

I was not aware of that.

- Well, now you are.
- Oh, all right.

- Leonard?
- Yes?

When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

Good night.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Leonard? Leonard?

Leonard? Leonard?

This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

Leonard? Leonard?

- What?
- I was analyzing our lie...

...and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

- How?
- Simple.

If she were to log on to www.
socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other...

...click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the PDF schedule...

...and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

...bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

Good morning.

- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Of course I do.

My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

...your question may
have been rhetorical.

What do you want?

Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

...because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

I remember symposium.

Yes, well, he lied.

Wait, what?

He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

Hungry?

Tired?

I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

You told her I lied?

Why would you tell her I lied?

To help you.

I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

...so I told her that you were lying
to protect me.

[LEONARD GROANS]

Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

Hunger?

Indigestion?

I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

Anyway, Penny now believes
that on Friday night...

...we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

Your cousin Leopold.

Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

Remember that, it's important.

- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

I think you'd call him Lee.

I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

...where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

- Un-unravelable?
- Yes.

If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

...an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

...and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.

Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

Ah! Because it's in Long Beach
and I don't drive.

We're going to Long Beach?

Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

...emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

So he goes back into rehab?

Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

You still told her I lied.

Yeah, for a noble purpose.

To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

...when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

Un-unravelable.

Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

- You look great.
PENNY: Thanks.

I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

LEONARD:
Oh.

- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

When he has a symposium to go to.

I don't know what to say.

- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

- Oh, boy, group hug.
- Uh-uh.

- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...

...which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

I don't know what to say.

Wow.

- Howard...
- It's your Millennium Falcon...

...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

Howard, wait.

Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

Okay, sure.

I don't see a problem with that.

There's no symposium.

Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

Well...

- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

Every family in America has a relative...

...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

- ...because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, Penny.

- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

So road trip to Long Beach.

- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

Oh, too bad.

I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

Let it go, Sheldon.

The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

No, that's the least of our worries.

I've been doing research on addiction...

...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

...and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

Sadly, it's not.

Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

- ...would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

Because Leo's a middle child.

There's no Leo. How can you say that?

You didn't read the bio, did you?

He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

...the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

...is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

Get out.

Fine.

I've hesitated to point this out...

...but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

...because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

SHELDON:
We'll talk in the morning.

Morning.

Who are you?

I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

Oh, God.

Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

Au contraire.

I'm 26 years old...

...I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

...probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

Excuse me, we just went over this.

As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

...but he also minored in theater at MIT.

It was more of a double major, actually.

Theater and Physics.

You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

Yeah, I got it.

Sheldon, why?

You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

...it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

- ...and coming home with us.
- Oh...

Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

When I was 14 years old...

...I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

...to inadequate serotonin production.

Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

Subtextually, of course.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Just have fun with it.

- Morning, Penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

Come say hello.

Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

Let me ask you something, Penny.

Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

...next to a transsexual prostitute?

- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

Well, that's Leo.

Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

Oh, it was okay, I guess.

Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

I'm sorry?

The Philippines.

1992.

The Subic Bay Naval Station.

A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

...who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

...but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

...shoved down his adolescent throat.

What choice did he have...

...but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

Never been proven.

- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

Do you wanna see it?

- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

...than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

Yeah.

Funny how things work out.

But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

...that his own father failed to provide.

Your parents made the right decision.

I cannot work like this.

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
ON TV]

This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

You're gonna do okay.

One day at a time, Penny.

One day at a time.

How long is he going to stay here?

He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.

[English - US - SDH]

- Checkmate.
- Aaarggh!

Again?

Obviously, you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land
would be more your speed.

Just reset the board.

It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

- Get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.

- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than North Dakota.

I guess that joke's only funny
in Nebraska.

From the data at hand,
you can't draw that conclusion.

All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

Boy, it's good to be back.

- How's your family?
- Oh, it was the worst trip.

- Everyone got sick over the weekend.
- Sick?

Here we go.

- What kind of sick?
- Oh, the flu, I guess.

I don't need you to guess,
I need you to know.

Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

Maybe Friday.

Friday. Was that morning or afternoon?

- I don't...
- Think, woman.

Who blew their nose and when?

Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

I'm sure she's not contagious.

Oh, please.

If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear...

...it would've died out years ago.

Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting...

...Homo habilis would've figured out
to kill the guy with the runny nose.

Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

That's okay. I understand.

Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

You'd better go
before he starts spraying you with Lysol.

Okay, well,
thank you for getting my mail.

No, problem. Welcome home.

[CAN SPRAYING]

SHELDON:
What?

What the hell are you doing?

I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

With lime Jell-O?

I need a growth medium, and someone
polished off the apricot yogurt.

Here. Swab my throat.

- I don't think so.
- Leonard.

If I'm going to get ahead of this, I need
to find out what's growing in my throat.

Sheldon, you are not sick.

This is, but you are not.

We have no idea what pathogen...

...Typhoid Penny
has introduced into our environment.

And having never been to Nebraska, I'm
certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.

Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me...

...these cultures
and my accompanying notes...

...will give them a fighting chance.

I'm going back to bed.

- Wait, put this in the bathroom.
- What for?

I need to measure
my fluid intake and output...

...to make sure
my kidneys aren't shutting down.

I mix pancake batter in this.

No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment...

...including the label-maker...

...but you didn't have 10 seconds
to make one that said, "Urine cup"?

It's right here on the bottom.

Huh.

I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company
a letter of apology.

[COUGHING]

[IN CONGESTED VOICE]
Oh, dear God.

Leonard.

Leonard, I'm sick.

Leonard.

[SHELDON COUGHING]

Leonard, I'm sick.

Leonard.

Leonard.

Leonard.

Leonard, my comforter fell down
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

Leonard?

Ow.

LEONARD: Hey.
- Leonard, where are you?

I'm at work.

At 6:30 in the morning?

Yes.

On Sunday?

Yes.

- Why?
- They asked me to come in.

- Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
- They texted me.

Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2a. m...

...and I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.

[SHELDON COUGHING]

- No kidding.
- Nope. Not only that...

...it has shifted from clear
to milky green.

All right, well, get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

What else would I drink?
Gases? Solids? Ionized plasma?

Drink whatever you want.

- I want soup.
- Then make soup.

- We don't have soup.
- I'm at work, Sheldon.

[DOG BARKING]

- Is that a dog?
- Yes.

- In the lab?
- Yes.

They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge...

...for when they need dogs to operate
the centrifuge for blind scientists.

I have to go.

[PHONE RINGING]

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, it's the phone.

I know it's the phone, Ma.
I hear the phone.

- Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
- I don't know.

Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour.

How can I ask them
when I'm talking to you?

Hello?

Howard, it's Leonard. Code milky green.

- Dear Lord, not milky green.
- Affirmative. With fever.

- Who's on the phone?
- It's Leonard.

- Why is he calling?
- Sheldon's sick.

Were you playing with him?

For God's sake, Ma, I'm 26 years old.

Excuse me, Mr. Grownup.

- What do you want for breakfast?
- Chocolate milk and Eggos, please.

- Howard, listen to me.
- Hang on. Call waiting.

- No, don't... Don't...
- Hello?

Howard, I'm sick.

[IMITATING MRS. WOLOWITZ]
Howard's sleeping. This is his mother.

Why are you calling
at this ungodly hour?

I need soup.

Then call your own mother.

[LINE BEEPS]

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
It was Sheldon.

- I tried to stop you.
- It's my own fault.

I forgot the protocol we put in place
after the great ear infection of '06.

You call Koothrappali.

We need to find a place to lay low
for the next 18 to 24 hours.

Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?

I just had the carpet steamed.

That's a negatory.

But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon
at the Nuart today.

Five movies, two hours apiece.

It's a start.

Homeless crazy guy at Table 18.

[BLOWS NOSE]

[COUGHS]

No, just crazy.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

- I'm sick. Thank you very much.
- How could you've gotten it from me?

- I'm not sick.
- You're a carrier.

All these people here are doomed.

- You're doomed.
- Shh!

Sheldon, what do you want?

I want soup.

[CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY]

Why didn't you just...?

[CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY]

Why didn't you just have soup at home?

Penny, I have an IQ of 187.

Don't you imagine
that if there were a way for me...

...to have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

You can have soup delivered.

I did not think of that.

Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

Please bring me some soup
while I still understand what a spoon is for.

Okay. What kind of soup do you want?

Well, my mother used to make me
this split-pea...

...with little frankfurter slices
and these homemade croutons.

We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

Can I get any of those with little
frankfurter slices and homemade croutons?

No.

Then surprise me.

[BLOWS NOSE]

Would you call that moss green
or forest green?

HOWARD:
Look at this. Everyone went chimp.

RAJESH:
I'd like to point out, I voted for orangutan...

...but you shouted me down.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

LEONARD: Oh, hi, Penny.
- Hey, where are you?

I'm at work.

You sound funny.

Oh, I'm in a radiation suit.

- What's up?
- Yeah, well, I'm at work too.

And you'll never guess who's here
infecting my entire station.

Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.

- Just tell him to go home.
- Well, he won't leave.

He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the
bus and someone will harvest his organs.

He's paranoid
and he's established a nest.

Can you please come get him?

Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to, Penny.

[HOWARD IMITATES ALARM]

LEONARD: Oh, my God,
there's a breach in the radiation unit.

The whole city is in jeopardy.

Oh, my God. Professor Guggenheim
is melting. Gotta go. Bye.

- I feel really guilty.
RAJESH: You did what you had to do.

HOWARD [IMITATES CHARLTON HESTON]:
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn...

...you damn dirty ape.

Thanks for bringing me home.

Oh, it's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.

It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

Good, good.

Okay, well, you feel better.

Wait. Where are you going?

Um, home to write some bad checks.

You're going to leave me?

Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?

Of course, but not by myself.

Really? Never?

Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...

...at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

- Studying abroad?
- No, visiting professor.

Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...

...and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...

...with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.

And there was no one there
to take care of you?

No, my mom had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...

...because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

- Again?
- It was tornado season.

And it was an aluminum house.

Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.

When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...

...she said,
"MÃ¶chtest du eine DarmspÃ¼lung?"

What does that mean?

Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema?"

Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.
What do you need?

Well, my mom used to give me
sponge baths.

Okay, ground rules:

No sponge baths
and definitely no enemas.

Agreed.

Here we go.
Ten and a half hours of apey goodness.

[THX'S "DEEP NOTE"
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

[GLASSES CLATTER]

Damn it, my glasses.

Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?

- Sorry.
- Okay.

[GLASSES BREAKING]

Found them.

[MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

- Oh, great.
- I'm sorry. Don't you have a spare?

- Yeah, at home.
- If you leave now, you can be back...

...before the gorillas whip
the crap out of Charlton Heston.

Unless Sheldon's there.

You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

Hi, Penny?

I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

He's home. I'm screwed.

Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

How about Lasik?

- You want me to get eye surgery?
- Would you rather go back...

...and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

- Well?
- I'm thinking.

Okay, nice and cozy.

- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

Will you please rub this on my chest?

Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.

- But, Sheldon...
- Please, please, please.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

Sorry.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?

What?

My mom used to sing it to me
when I was sick.

- I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.

[SINGING]
Soft kitty, warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

Purr, purr, purr

Now you.

[SIGHS]

[SINGING]
Soft kitty, warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Keep rubbing.

Little ball of fur

What do you see? What do you see?
I can't...

- Living room appears to be empty.
- Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

I'm not going in there.

- Raj?
- No way, Jose.

- But I can't do it. I can't see anything.
- It's all right.

Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

We'll be your eyes.

- Fine.
- One more thing.

This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.

If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

...this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

...you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

Won't my footsteps set it off?

No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

HOWARD:
Stay low.

Bear left.

- Now keep true.
- What?

- It means go straight.
- Then just say, "Go straight."

You don't say, "Go straight," when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true."

All right.

I just hit my head.

Because you didn't keep true.

Okay, turn right.

The picture's breaking up.

Angle your head to the right.

Now, a little more.

Little more.

That's it. Now just keep true.

All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

Now turn it on.

- It wasn't on?
- No.

Then why did I have to crawl?

Oh, I guess you didn't.

Okay, it's on.

Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

I know.

[BEEPING]

Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

Turn your head back.

You rat bastard.

HOWARD:
Told you the sensor would work.

Hi.

You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

SHELDON:
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

- Leonard's home.
- No.

- Here you go, good luck, bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

SHELDON: Leonard? I'm hungry.
- Wait. Penny, take me with you.

SHELDON:
Leonard?

I want grilled cheese.

Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

I'm very congested.

Yeah? So?

Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

If I stand, I'll vomit.

Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.

[English - US - SDH]

Here's the problem with teleportation.

Lay it on me.

Assuming a device could be invented...

...which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

How about that.

I would never use a transporter.

The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

...in order to create a new Sheldon.

Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

No, he would be exactly the same.

That is a problem.

So you see it too?

Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

BOTH:
Dr. Gablehauser.

Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

Advantage, Kim.

I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

I know you're not.

You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

Dennis, we've discussed this.

We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

We welcome your input
on our research goals.

We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

We want him here, boys.

- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

You can count on us. We're on it.

What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

In addition...

Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

I sense a disturbance in the force.

[IMITATING YODA]
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

So how long have you been in America?

- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

What are you talking about?

That.

He's not wrong.

All right, and this is my office.

- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

- Keen observation, goodbye.
- You see where you went wrong, don't you?

- Leonard.
- Ha.

- Yeah?
- Get him out.

Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

Do I look like I lift weights?

Not heavy ones.

It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

You think I haven't considered it?

- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

I'll show you the radiation lab.

Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

Really? How old?

Fourteen and a half.

Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

Hey, I'm damaged too.

How about a hug for Howie?

Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

Something you'd like to share?

A tale of woe perhaps?

Fifteen years old.

Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

You know, that other guy.

Antonio Salieri?

Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

Why waste food?

When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

You can't let this kid get to you.

You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

And that there'd be an asterisk by his name
because he'd be a cyborg.

So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

We liked Leonard.

What are you gonna do, just give up?

Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

...and he waits to die.

I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

- Hey.
- Hey.

I've decided you're right.

- My career is not over.
- Great.

But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

...I just have to find
something else to focus on.

Great.

So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

Great.

So, what exactly is it you do?

I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

...of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

Oh, sure you do.

Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

Okay.

I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

- All right.
- Go away.

If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

I'm looking at it right now.

Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

So this is Engineering, huh?

I'll talk to you later.

Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

...execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

I just came by to say hello.

For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

So, what are we making today?

A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

- ...that's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

It will be attached to the payload bay...

...and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

Aha.

So it's a shelf.

No, you don't understand.

During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

I notice you're using titanium.

Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula."

But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

- Sheldon.
- Yes?

Go away.

Did Leonard tell you to say that?

No, I thought of it all by myself.

Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

Go away.

SHELDON:
Curiouser and curiouser.

- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.

You know what he did?
He watched me work...

...and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

Is that even possible?

As it turns out, yes.

- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

...and more accomplished than he is.

What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

Then our problem would be solved.

Hang on, are we talking about
murdering Dennis Kim?

I'm not saying no.

We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

We can't send him back to North Korea.

He knows how to get out.

The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

It won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

- What about biology?
- What?

You know, biology.

The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

...and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

She was sleeping with you?

No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

Oh, good, you're all here.

I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

...we could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

Go away?

Hmm.

Could it be me?

Hey, guys, what's up?

We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

- What?
- Howard, that's racist.

Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
- No, no, please come in.

I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize
in Physics have disappeared... Thank you.

...I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

...to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Look, I'm going
to solve the Middle East crisis...

...by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

To what end?

You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come."

Who will come?

The Jewish people.

What if they don't come?

We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

...we're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

- ...who's agreed to join us at the university.
- Of course he has.

The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

You can see the matrix, can't you?

Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

Come, Dennis.

You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

He's nuts.

[SHELDON HUMMING "CIELITO LINDO"]

[SINGING IN HEBREW]

They'll come, they'll settle
And I'll win the prize

I don't understand your objections,
Professor Goldfarb.

Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert
make a perfectly good Promised Land?

Go away.

We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

Please go away.

Said Pharaoh to Moses.

Why are all these young women here?

It's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

Really? I was not aware of that.

Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

...that was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

...they had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

Hmm.

- Smooth.
- Thank you.

There's the man of the hour.

So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

All he has to do is hook up with one.

Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

We need a social catalyst.

Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

...but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

...would you still wail at it?

Okay, it's definitely me.

We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

...and figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

How about that one?

Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

You're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs.

- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

Okay. Uh...

Oh, hey, how about her?

Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

...while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians.

And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

...and wishes more guys were like you.

She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

Okay, so not her either.

How about her?

Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

I think that's our girl.

One of us should go talk to her.

I can't talk to her, you do it.

I can't just go up and talk to her.

Howard, you talk to her.

I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

In India, this would be simpler.

Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

Well, we're not in India.

Why don't we do it your way, then?

We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

[GLASS CLINKING]

Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

What a wonderful occasion this is.

And how fortunate that it should
fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

Welcome, Dennis Kim.

Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University...

...he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

And now, without any further ado...

...let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

Dennis? Dennis.

What?

Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

The kid got a girl.

Unbelievable.

Did anyone see how he did it?

Don't worry, I've got this.

Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

...while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naivetÃ©...

...has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

...let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

Thank you.

[CLAPPING]

- He's back.
- Yeah, mission accomplished.

Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

I guess times have changed
since we were young.

Smart is the new sexy.

Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

Maybe we're too smart.

So smart, it's off-putting.

Yeah, let's go with that.

Unbelievable.

Components I built
are on the space station...

...and I get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

I don't know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as for telling the policewoman:

"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

Hey, look at that.

It's Dennis Kim.

Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.

I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

Yeah, we really ruined his life.

Screw him, he was weak.

[English - US - SDH]

Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.

There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...

- ...it's an extremely private matter.
- I'd like to know the details.

His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

...with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?

How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?

No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."

[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

Hi. Can you help me?

I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.

Now it's just going, "Aaaah."

- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

Diet Coke.

And yogurt.

And a little nail polish.

I'll take a look at it.

Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

...Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...

...in the Physics Bowl this year.

- You're kidding. Why not?
- They formed a barbershop quartet...

...and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.

Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

Recognize.

This is our year. With those guys out...

...the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

- Zod?
- Kryptonian villain. Long story.

Good story.

- Count me out.
- What? Why?

You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

...and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.

Tickets to that, please.

Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

No, don't.

"The needs of the many..."

"Outweigh the needs of the few..."

"Or the one."

Damn it, I'll do it.

Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.

We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

- The ladies?
- Perpetual Motion Squad...

...we can go all night.

- I like it.
- I don't.

Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

...thus intimidating one's opponent.

We could be the Bengal Tigers.

Poor choice. Gram for gram...

...no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

Let's put it to a vote.

- All those in favor...
- Point of order.

I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...

...when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

- I will yield.
- After we go through the exercise...

...of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

...does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

- He does.
- We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?

Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...

...I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

...and isn't that just a little sad?

- Gentlemen, are you ready?
LEONARD: Yes.

HOWARD: Fire away.
- It's none of my business...

...but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- Dr. Cooper.
- Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

- That is correct.
- I knew that too.

Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- Howard?
- The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

And I answered. It's called teamwork.

Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

Just ask another one.

Okay.

"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.

Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

- Why?
- Because it's polite.

What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...

...to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

The objective is to give correct answers.

If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

- Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
- All right, that's it.

- Howard, sit down.
- Okay.

- We should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.

[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

I agree.

What did he say?

He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

...one might use on a summer's eve.

Yeah, and the bag it came in.

Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

The colors are based
on Star Trek: The Original Series.

The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

Why do they say "AA"?

Army Ants.

Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.

Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

No, I meant...

Never mind.

Hey, check it out.

I got you a Batman cookie jar.

Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

...and you're off the team.

SHELDON:
What?

Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

- You didn't.
- We did. I just came from there.

I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

Okay, let me try it this way.

I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

...and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

- Why?
- Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl
the team that has the most fun?

Okay. Let me try it this way.

You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

I see.

Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

...and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

...and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

Thanks for the heads up.

You're welcome.

- One more thing.
- Yes?

It's on, bitch.

- So who did he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

But we are also smart and strong...

...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."

How exactly would that laugh go?

Hee-hee-hee!

That sounds more like:

"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."

Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

So?

So nothing. Let's destroy him.

SHELDON:
Gentlemen.

RAJESH:
Hee-hee-hee!

Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

Why? Because you slept together...

...and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

Yes.

- You gotta take one for the team.
- Yeah. Sack up, dude.

Fine.

Here I go, taking one for the team...

...in the sack.

- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

...and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

Hit that thing.

There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

...your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

- ...confidentiality of the bedroom.
- That's all very comforting...

...but I'd like to get on my question now.

- Proceed.
- We are entering the Physics Bowl...

- ...and we need a fourth.
- No, thanks.

I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

Sorry.

Well, we tried.

We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.

Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

- Yes.
- That arrogant, misogynistic...

...doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

...for laundry and childbearing?

She's in.

PENNY:
So how do you feel?

Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

- Are you ready?
ALL: Oh.

Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

Okay.

- Gentlemen.
- Sheldon.

- Sheldon.
- Hee-hee-hee.

Sheldon.

I'm just gonna sit down.

So is that your team?

Actually, I don't need a team.

I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

My Spanish is not good.
...either her son or her butcher.

And what about your team?

What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

LESLIE:
Hello, Sheldon.

Leslie Winkle.

Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

...returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

Oh, ouch.

Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

Here's your T-shirt.

PMS?

It's a couple days early.

No.

It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

AA versus PMS.

All night long, y'all.

Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- PMS?
- The eta meson.

Correct.

- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

Denied. All right, for 10 points.

"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- AA?
- And, of course, the answer is technetium.

Terrific.

Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- PMS?
- And Sheldon can suck on...

- ...the Casimir effect.
GABLEHAUSER: Correct.

"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

- PMS?
- Shor's algorithm.

GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

PrÃ©vost's theory of exchanges.

Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

A sigma particle.

Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

The score now stands,
AA, 1150, PMS, 1175.

So for 100 points and the match...

...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

Solve the equation.

Holy crap.

What the hell is that?

It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

- Come on, think. Leslie?
- It's not gonna work if you rush me.

- You have to let me get there.
- You are never gonna let that go, are you?

Ten seconds.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

PMS?

Sorry, I panicked.

Then guess.

Um...

Eight.

Point four.

I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

AA, I need your answer.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

Winning Physics Bowl.

How do you know anything
about physics?

Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

Leningrad Politechnika.

Go, Polar Bears.

That's a delightful little story.

Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

...but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

Ow!

AA, I need your official answer.

- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

- I want a different question.
- You can't.

- Formal protest.
- Denied.

Informal protest.

Denied.

- I need your official answer.
- No, I decline to provide one.

That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

That's your opinion.

- All right, the winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

I didn't understand the question.

- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

- Who?
- My Physics Bowl trophy.

That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

My Physics Bowl trophy.

"Leonard is so smart.

- Sheldon who?"
- All right, that is just very immature.

You're right. I'm sorry.

"I'm not!"

- Okay, new contest.
LEONARD: What are you doing?

I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

- Okay? Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

- Bring it on.
PENNY: Okay.

"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

The Brady Bunch.

Okay.

"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

The Brady Bunch?

Van Halen.

All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

How do you know these things?

I go outside and I talk to people.

Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

...for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive?"

- William Shatner.
- Wait.

I don't think it's Shatner.

Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

- No.
- Formal protest.

All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops!... I Did It Again'?"

Okay.

"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

Romulan.

Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.

[PENNY SIGHS]

[English - US - SDH]

Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

I asked for turkey and roast beef...

- ...with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
- What'd they give you?

Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

...to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time-machine prop...

...from the original film
and no one is bidding.

A time machine
from the movie The Time Machine?

No, a time machine
from Sophie's Choice.

Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

Did you see it? It's rough.

HOWARD: Oh, that's cool.
LEONARD: Uh-huh.

- It's only $800?
- Yeah. And that's my bid.

- You bid $800?
- It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

- There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
- Do you have $800?

- Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
- Don't worry.

People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

- Fifteen seconds.
- Come on, snipers.

- Ten, nine, eight...
- Where are your snipers?

- Five.
- Snipe.

- Four.
- Snipe.

- Three, two.
- Snipe, snipe.

- One.
- Ah!

Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

- You lucky duck.
LEONARD: Heh.

I wonder why no one else bid.

This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

I know. But I still can't afford it.

Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

- ...and take turns having it in our house.
- A time-share time machine.

- I'm in. Sheldon?
- Wha...? Need you ask?

But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

I understand why no one else bid.

Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

I just assumed.

Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

...within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

...and "need $800."

It's actually a tremendous bargain.

Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

How are we gonna get it upstairs?

If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

...I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

No, that baby's broken.

LEONARD:
Come on, guys, push.

HOWARD: If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

RAJESH:
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up.

It's the same amount of work,
no matter how fast you go. Basic physics.

RAJESH: Sheldon.
- Yeah?

RAJESH: If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

[RAJESH AND HOWARD SCREAM]

Take a break, guys.

- What are you doing?
- Just moving something upstairs.

- What is it?
- Just, you know, a time machine.

Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

- Just give us a few minutes.
- I'm running really late.

Then I have a simple solution.

Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... There's a gap.

Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo... and use their stairwell.

- You're joking, right?
- Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

...I can drop you off at work yesterday.

Time-travel joke. It's not... Never mind.

For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

[CHORTLES]

Let's just do this.

- You guys ready to push?
RAJESH: In a minute.

Howard stepped outside to throw up.

I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor...

...from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future...

...where society had splintered
into two factions:

the subterranean Morlocks...

...who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.

Talk about your chick magnets.

Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob.

Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

...but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house."

How lame is that?

- He's got a point.
SHELDON: All right.

We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

"No eating in the time machine."
I propose that we add:

"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine."

Seconded.

I was gonna put down a towel.

I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

- That sounds fair.
- Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

- Every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.

- Then no.
- Okay, every other month.

No.

Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

[ALL GASPING]

Okay. I am setting the dials
for March 10th, 1876.

Good choice. Alexander Graham Bell
invents the telephone and calls for Watson.

- Wait a minute. I wanna see that too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

If we all go back to the same time,
Bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

He'll know something's up.

Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

- ...you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
- Even if you make it to Boston...

...what are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "Fan of your husband.

Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

- ...and obtain a cloaking device.
- Ooh. How far into the future?

If I remember, Kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the Romulans...

...on stardate 5027.3...

...which would be January 10th, 2328,
by pre-Federation reckoning.

Okay, I am setting the dials
for January 10th, 2328.

Here we go into the future.

That was fun.

[LAUGH ING]

My turn.

Okay, first of all, what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

[BUZZING]

The door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked.

I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the third floor...

...forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family...

...who insisted I stay for lunch.

That doesn't sound too bad.

It was eight courses of lamb.
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

- Sorry.
- Not done.

By the time I got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

Yeah, that's right.
I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

- This...
- Time machine.

The lights flash and the dish spins.
Wanna try?

No.

I don't wanna try it.
My God, you are grown men.

How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys...

...and costumes and comic books,
and now that?

- That...
- Again, time machine.

Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

...something Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

It only moves in time.

It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.

My turn.

Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.

- So?
- So it's my turn.

Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

Ergo, you would still have it.
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

Same paradox.

If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

...you wouldn't have the conversation
that irritated you...

...motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

It won't change the past.

But it'd make the present so much nicer.

Are you upset about something?

What was your first clue?

Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset.

Oh.

I don't usually pick up on those things.

Good for me.

Yeah, good for you.

Oh, wait.

Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

- I don't know. Maybe.
- Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

Well, here's the thing.

Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

I disagree.

Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

...long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

That failure clearly stands on its own.

- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...

...with that time machine.

In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...

...with his extremely attractive
young mother.

- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

That's absurd.

LEONARD:
Come on, guys, push.

HOWARD: If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

[RAJESH AND HOWARD SCREAM]

Take a break, guys.

What are you doing?

Oh, you know,
just moving a time machine.

Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

No problem.

Hang on.

But what about your time machine?

Some things are more important
than toys.

I'm scared.

Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

Oh, Leonard.

It's still my turn.

What are you doing?

I'm packing up all my collectibles...

...and taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.

Is that really necessary?

If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

And semen.

It's not about money.

We brought food.

Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

- Why?
- Because I don't want it anymore.

- Why?
- Just personal reasons.

My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.

Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

- I paid $200 for my share.
- Everybody knows a time machine loses...

...half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

Three hundred. And I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...

...with real light-speed sound effects.

No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

...or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

I'm getting rid of all of it.

You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

It's like Nerdvana.

More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

- Not for long.
- I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

I need that to complete
my Justice Society of America collection.

- I called dibs.
- You can't.

I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.

Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

- Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?

He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business. Take it or leave it.

Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

Who cares? As long as you pick me.

Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

Sorry, Raj, my mind is made up.

No. I can't let you do this.

Sheldon, get out of my way.

None shall pass.

Okay.

I did not wanna do this...

...but I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

...Star Trek: The Next Generation
Geordi La Forge without his VISOR...

...in the original packaging.

If you do not get out of my way...

...I will open it.

Okay, man, be cool.

We're all friends here.

What the hell's going on?

- You hypocrite.
- What?

Little Miss Grown-Ups-
Don't-Play-With-Toys.

If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

Hello, Hello Kitty.

Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

...I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

- No, I needed to hear it.
- You didn't. You are a great guy.

And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

I guess that makes me large breasts.

Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

...and, you know, move on with my life.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Oh. Wow.

Good for you.

Thanks.

Hey, do you wanna,
I don't know, later...?

Excuse me.

- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

- You ready to go?
- I just have to change.

- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, stop it.

Bye, guys.

[DOOR CLOSES]

My turn on the time machine.

It worked.

It really worked.

They said I was mad, but it worked.

Oh, no, not Morlocks.

Not flesh-eating Morlocks.

Help!

[SCREAMS]

Sheldon, are you okay?

We have to get rid of the time machine.

It is a little big for the living room,
isn't it?

Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

Come on in, fellas.

Oh, no, Morlocks.

Eat him, eat him.

[SCREAMING]

[GASPING]

Leonard!

[English - US - SDH]

On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

...it'll create a black hole and swallow up
the Earth, ending life as we know it.

What a bunch of crybabies.

No guts, no glory, man.

Hey, check it out.

The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety...

...panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder."

Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

I don't know, Raj.

Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

- What's going on?
- Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

Sheldon's office?

Is she lost?

I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

- Maybe she's his lawyer.
- Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

- Howard...
- I know, I'm disgusting.

I should be punished.

By her. Oh, look, I did it again.

MISSY: Well, that should do it.
- Thank you for coming by.

Hello.

Oh, hey, buddy.

Buddy?

Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project...

...that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

Well, how can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

Nobody ever expects me.

Sometimes you just look,
and bam, Howard Wolowitz.

- Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, all right. This is Missy.

Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, as well also.

Yeah.

So how do you two know each other?

Oh, he once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

Excuse me?

She's my twin sister.

She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

A humormometer?

Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:

[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]

Okay, so let me see if I got this.
Leonard, Howard and...

I'm sorry, what was your name again?

Rajesh.

So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

...and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

And don't ever call me Shelly.

So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

I'll walk you to your car.
You're in Structure 3, Level C, right?

What just happened?

So anyway, we're 8 years old...

...and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

That's just classic.

I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

...for homemade integrated circuits.

He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

Not your eyebrows?

Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

...with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

Is that what that was? I just assumed...

...that the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear
in the drier downstairs.

Pfft.

Those are not mine.

Really? They have
your little name label in them.

Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

...just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

I spearfish.

When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.

- Hi.
- Wow, you don't look that much alike.

Can I get a hallelujah?

Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

Hallelujah.

Hey, guess what.

I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

...to overcome pathological shyness.

- Oh, good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful.

Hello, Missy.

They mentioned
there may be side effects.

So, Missy...

...have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

- Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
- Yes, Patel. Good man.

Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

You still have to wear a helmet.

- Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
- The sex book.

The Indian sex book.

In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

...it was us.

- So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

Oh. Eh...

Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

And perfect.

Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

I brought snacks.

Oh, my. Gherkins and...

Onion dip. It's onion dip.

We don't entertain much.

Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

- I guess.
- Yeah, we Indians invented them.

You're welcome.

Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

You're welcome.

Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

God, yes. Thanks.

You're welcome.

- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy.

Bye, Missy, see you.

- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Yeah, no, bye, Penny.

- You two have to back off.
- Why should I back off? You back off.

Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

- So what? You've got Penny.
- How do I have Penny?

In what universe do I have Penny?

- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no.

Excuse me, can I interject something?

I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

- Thank you.
SHELDON: It's okay.

Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

[IN INDIAN ACCENT] I'm a fancy
Indian man. We invented pajamas.

Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.

Sheldon.

Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

Hm.

She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.

It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

...heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

- That's fascinating...
- I didn't say fascinating.

I said it was noteworthy.

All right. Noted.

But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz...

They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's...

Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

...but we'd be further along
in this conversation...

...if you'd begun with that thought.

That's great, but...

We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

Whatever.

- You have to do something about it.
- Why?

Because she's your sister.

I don't understand.

Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

Okay, consider this.

With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

...to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.

I hadn't considered that.

We do share DNA.

So there is the possibility,
however remote...

...that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

...as remarkable as myself.

Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

...to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...

...they'll have to go through me.

[LAUGH ING]

I am Shiva, the destroyer.
I will have the woman.

I'm warning you.
I was judo champion at math camp.

All right.
That's enough juvenile squabbling.

You stop it. You stop it, I say.

I'm gonna settle this right now.

Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

Who are you to decide that?

He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

- You're out too, by the way.
- Say what?

Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...

...didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an Eskimo Pie.

- What are you so happy about?
- I'm not happy.

It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...

...we have to face the fact
that none of you are suitable for my sister.

Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?

We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

- How so?
- Everybody knows genetic diversity...

...produces the strongest offspring.

Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

In principle, you have a point.

But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

...to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

Is it because I'm Jewish?

Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

This has nothing to do with religion.

This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

...who still lives with his mother.

- Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
- Am I?

Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

MISSY:
Oh, really?

Oops.

Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?

Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

Okay.

I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

...but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

...but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

...an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

That would be you.

But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

- Sheldon 2.0?
- Exactly.

Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

If you're not attracted, then the likelihood
of conception will be reduced.

- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

Okay, Shelly, sit down.

Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

...as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.

I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

...leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

I thought it ended at cuckoo.

Now, you listen to me.

If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

Bring it on.

But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

...and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

...have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

That way, everybody wins.

Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

- Look, we have to settle this.
- I agree.

Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

- Don't start with me, dude.
- You wanna go again?

- Sit down.
- Okay.

If we're gonna fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

The honorable way.

HOWARD:
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

LEONARD:
Take that.

You want some more?

And he's down.

MAN [ON TV]:
One, two, three, four...

- Come on, come on! Get up.
- Stay down, bitch.

Seven, eight, nine, 10.

[BELL DINGS ON TV]

Yeah! Natural selection at work.

I weep for humanity.

Excuse me
while I go tell Missy the good news.

- Hey.
- Hi, Penny, how's it going?

That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

- Pretty much, why?
- Just catching up.

By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

Of course.

Hi, Leonard, what's up?

Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

Oh.

- Do you have other plans or...?
- No.

All right.

- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks, I'll see you.

Um, here's something
we didn't anticipate.

- What do you want, Howard?
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

I've come to call on Missy.

Missy.

- Hi, Howard.
- The Amazing Howard.

- Do you like magic?
- Not really, no.

Then you are in for a treat.

Behold, an ordinary cane.

[HUMS]

Ta-da.

No.

Okay.

[HUMMING]

Missy.

Thank you, I apprec...

Apprec...

Appre...

Uh-oh.

Oh, honey,
is your medication wearing off?

Well, hi, cutie pie.
I was hoping you'd show up.

[SCREECHES]

[SCREECHING]

We had a dog
who made a noise like that.

Had to put him down.

Any news you want me
to pass along to Mom?

Well, she might be interested to know
that I've refocused my research...

...from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

Yeah, I'll just tell her you said, "Hey."

Okay. Well, it was pleasant seeing you.

Other than that business
with my testicles.

Come on, Shelly.

I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

- Really?
- Yep.

I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

- Well, yeah.
- I'm a theoretical physicist.

- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

- Goodbye, Shelly.
- My God.

Why don't you just tell them that
I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge?

A rocket scientist, how humiliating.

[English - US - SDH]

LEONARD: Nice move.
RAJESH: I've got it.

HOWARD: Take him down.
LEONARD: He's got you, Sheldon.

HOWARD: Come on.
LEONARD: He's completely schooling you.

Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.

- It's Tressling.
- It combines the physical strength...

...of arm wrestling with the mental agility
of Tetris into the ultimate sport.

That's terrific, but what they wanted me
to ask you is to cut it the hell out.

All right, come on, guys. Come on.

WAIT STAFF [SINGING]:
Happy birthday to you

We might as well stop, it's a stalemate.

You're beating me in Tetris, but you've got
the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.

Keebler elf?
I got a Keebler elf right here.

[RAJESH GROAN ING]

Okay, it's a stalemate.

Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday
for your free birthday cheesecake?

He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.

Okay, he can have carrot cake.

- What about the cream-cheese frosting?
- He can scrape it off.

Forget about the cake.
How did you know my birthday's Saturday?

I did your horoscope, remember?

I was gonna do everybody's until Sheldon
went on one of his psychotic rants.

For the record, that psychotic rant...

...was a concise summation
of the research of Bertram Forer...

...who, in 1948, proved conclusively...

...through meticulous experiments...

...that astrology
is pseudoscientific hokum.

Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.

- So we gonna see you Saturday?
- I don't think so.

- Why not?
- I don't celebrate my birthday.

Shut up. Yeah, you do.

It's no big deal.
It's the way I was raised.

My parents focused
on celebrating achievements...

...and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

- That's so silly.
- It's actually based on very sound theories.

- His mother published a paper on it.
- Well, what was it called?

"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?

SHELDON:
It was obviously effective.

Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it.

Thank you.

Well, I love birthdays. Waking up
to Mom's special French-toast breakfast...

...wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends.

Yeah, see? That's what kids should have.

Actually, that was last year.

So you've really never had
a birthday party?

No, but it was okay.

When I was little, I'd think my parents
would change their mind and surprise me.

This one birthday,
I came home from my cello lesson...

...and I saw strange cars
parked out front.

When I got to the door,
I hear whispering...

...and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

- And?
- It turns out my grandfather had died.

Oh, my God, that's terrible.

Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

- That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
- You think?

Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.

HOWARD:
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy."

- Hello, Penny, Leonard just left.
- I know, I wanna talk to you.

What would we talk about?

We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

- As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
- Can you just let me in?

Well, all right, but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

Okay, here's the deal.

We'll throw Leonard a kickass
surprise party for his birthday.

I hardly think so.

Leonard made it clear
he doesn't want a party.

Did someone say party?

He just doesn't know he wants one,
because he's never had one.

I suppose that's possible.

But for the record, I've never had
a threesome and yet I still know I want one.

Here's the difference.

The possibility exists
Leonard could have a birthday party...

...before hell freezes over.

Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

Can you bring a friend?

I think a birthday party is a terrible idea.

I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

Anguish?

Year after year,
I had to endure wearing conical hats...

...while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

Not to mention being blindfolded...

...and spun toward
a grotesque tailless donkey...

...as the other children mocked
my disorientation.

Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars
that no non-professional can heal...

...but nevertheless, we're gonna
throw Leonard a birthday party.

I'm extremely uncomfortable
with dancing...

...loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity.

- Nevertheless...
- In addition...

You either help me
throw Leonard a birthday party...

...or I will go into your bedroom...

...and unbag all
your mint-condition comic books.

And on one of them... You won't know
which... I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

Well, of course, I... Oh.

Yeah, I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kickass birthday party.

That's not the secret knock.

This is the secret knock:

What difference does it make?

The point of a secret knock
is to establish a nonverbal signal...

...to verify the identity
of one's coconspirators.

PENNY: Is that Raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.

Would you just let us in?

Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

So, what'd you get the birthday boy?

Raj got him an awesome
limited-edition Dark Knight sculpture...

...based on Alex Ross'
definitive Batman.

And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Nice. I got him a sweater.

Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.

- Why not?
- Don't ask.

The entire institution of gift-giving
makes no sense.

- Too late.
- Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need...

...where you know what you need.

I could simplify things,
just give you the $50 directly...

...and then you could give me $50
on my birthday and so on...

...until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

And I ask you, is it worth it?

Told you not to ask.

Well, Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

I accept your premise,
I reject your conclusion.

Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

- What?
- Just do it.

[PENNY GROANS]

It's a non-optional social convention.

Ah, fair enough.

He came with a manual.

Question, how am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

I don't drive and the things available
in walking distance...

...are a Thai restaurant
and a gas station.

I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

Okay, let's do this.
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.

- Howard, get rid of Leonard for two hours.
- No problem.

And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

- What if guests show up?
- Entertain them.

What if they're women?

Stare at them
and make them feel uncomfortable.

[GUNSHOTS ON TV]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey.
- Hey.

- How's it going?
- Fine.

So listen, the Nuart is showing the revised,
definitive cut of Blade Runner.

- Seen it.
- No.

You've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.

This one has eight seconds
of previously-unseen footage.

They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

Pass.

Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q&A
with Harrison Ford's body double.

Look, I am in the "Halo" battle
of my life here.

There's this kid in Copenhagen,
he has no immune system.

So all he does is sit in his bubble
and play "Halo" 24/7.

Can't you play him some other time?

Not if you believe his doctors.

Oh, my God, do you smell gas?

- No.
- Yeah, no.

PENNY:
You know, they have DVDs over there.

Yes, but they have DVD burners
over here.

Leonard needs a DVD burner.

Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be
something someone needs.

It should be something fun.

- Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
- You mean, like a sweater?

Well, it's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.

- Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
- Okay.

The point is, one of the ways
we show we care about people...

...is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

- Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
- Exactly.

Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun, something like... Ah!

An 802. 11n wireless router.

Here you go, Copenhagen boy.

How about a taste
of Hans Christian hand grenade?

[EXPLOSION ON TV]

[MOUTHING]

LEONARD:
That could not feel good.

Come on, come on. Oh, you clever...

Come on, come on.

Take that.

Uh-oh.

[SHOUTING]
Uh-oh.

- What's the matter?
- This granola bar has peanuts in it.

- Oh, my God. Why did you eat it?
- I don't know, it was just there.

Well, if I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

Don't yell at me.

- I've gotta go to the emergency room.
- Now?

No, after my tongue has swollen
to the size of a brisket.

All right, just let me get my keys.

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...

The laundry is out of the hamper.

Okay, Sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

Fine, it's out of the washer.

I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

All right, let's go.

[CLEARING THROAT]

[PENNY SIGHING]

- What do you think?
- Um, that one.

- Because of the additional Ethernet ports?
- Sure.

He doesn't need them.
He's got a six-port Ethernet switch.

- Oh, okay, then this one.
- Why?

I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift,
I'm going to do it right.

I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

I know I'm gonna regret this,
but what trauma?

On my 12th birthday,
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge...

...so, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

Of course, yeah.

Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

Wow, this is hard.

They got me a motorized dirt bike.

No.

What 12-year-old boy
wants a motorized dirt bike?

All of them.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Huh.

- So we're getting this one?
- Yeah, I suppose.

All right, let's go.

Excuse me,
do you know anything about this stuff?

I know everything about this stuff.

Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business.

I wanna hook up my computer
in the front...

...with the one
in my refrigerated warehouse.

Buy this one, it's the one we're getting.
Happy guy.

No, she doesn't want that.

She needs a point-to-point peer network
with a range extender.

- Thank you.
- Which hard drive do I want?

- FireWire or USB?
- It depends on what bus you have available.

I drive a Chevy Cavalier.

Oh, dear Lord.

- We have to go.
- Not now, this poor man needs me.

You, hold on, I'll be right with you.

What computer do you have,
and please don't say a white one.

- Excuse me.
- Fill this out and have a seat.

We're throwing
my friend a surprise party...

...and I'm supposed to keep him out
for two hours.

Uh-huh. Fill this out and have a seat.

The way I could get him
to leave was tell him I ate a peanut.

I'm allergic to peanuts.

Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

All I need from you
is to give me a BAND-AID.

I can pretend I had epinephrine.

Tell my friend you need to keep me
under observation for an hour.

- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

Get out of my ER.

- No, you don't understand.
- I understand.

But unfortunately, this hospital
is not equipped to treat stupid.

Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

How about if I were to introduce you
to the man who freed your people?

Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin...

...and his five twin brothers,
you are wasting your time.

Hey. Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.
How are you doing?

Bad, very bad.

Really? You don't look
like you're swelling up.

We should pick up Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

- We can't go home.
- Why not?

Because... Phbbtt!

Brisket. Brisket.

- Water, need water.
- I'll be right back.

[CLEARING THROAT]

- Penny, listen, I've got a problem.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

- You gotta stall Leonard longer.
- I don't think I can.

You have to.
We all have to be there to yell "surprise."

You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

Why? Is Leonard okay?

Leonard's fine. I'm fine,
thanks for asking, by the way.

Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

I've done my best, but he wants to go home
and I don't know how to stop him.

Okay, how about this?

Keep him longer,
when you get to the party...

...I'll point out which of my friends
are easy.

Don't toy with me, woman.

I got a former fat girl
with no self-esteem.

A girl who punishes her father
by sleeping around.

An alcoholic who's two tequila shots
away from letting you wear her like a hat.

Thy will be done.

I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

Okay, we don't have that in stock...

...but I can special-order it for you.

Him.

Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.

Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

- Sheldon, we have to go.
- Why?

We're late for Leonard's birthday party...

...and for another,
I told him to call security.

Good luck.

By the way, a 6-year-old
could hack your computer.

Keep walking.

Yeah, 1234 is not a secure password.

My friend
is having allergic reaction to peanuts.

- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

Look, sir, we are very busy here
and I just don't...

Holy crap.

Please help me.

Code four. I need a gurney.

- Right away, right away.
- Thank you.

Say what you will
about healthcare in this country...

...but when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.

HOWARD: I really don't think
the colonoscopy was necessary.

Before you got all swollen up...

...I thought you're trying to keep me out
of the apartment...

...so you could throw me
a surprise party.

Oh, right, it's your birthday.

I had no idea it was your birthday.
I forgot.

What a lousy way to spend a birthday.
Well, it's all over now.

There is a party, isn't there?

Maybe.

Howard.

- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?

You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

Yeah, that's why I did it.

All right, here we go.

My first birthday party.

[SINGING CYNDI LAUPER'S
"TRUE COLORS"]

I see your true colors

And that's why I love you

Dude, everybody left an hour ago.

Surprise.

[ON PHONE]
Okay, Leonard...

...here I am at your birthday party.

I don't know where you are, dude,
but it's really kickass.

Everyone is very, very drunk and...
Ooh, mmm.

Oh, and look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off.

That's my friend Carol.

Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.

RAJESH: Oh, sweet Krishna,
shake that rupee maker.

- I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
- It's okay.

Well, happy birthday anyways.

Hey, Penny, when's your birthday?

[English - US - SDH]

[SHELDON SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

No, it's:

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

What's this?

That's what you did.

I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?

As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

...from the subject matter.

- I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
- Why?

Once you're fluent, you'll have a
billion more people to annoy instead of me.

Hey.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

Why are you learning Chinese?

I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off orange chicken...

...as tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

- I need to use your window.
- Oh, hey. Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.

Hey, jerk face. You forgot your iPod.

- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

That stupid, self-centered bastard
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

Drop dead,
you stupid, self-centered bastard.

Thank you.

Okay, where were we?

Not now. I have a blog to find.

Penny, are you okay?

PENNY:
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

- Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.

She doesn't wanna talk.

Not surprising.

Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

...to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

Hey, look, I found an iPod.

It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

...which I cannot find anywhere.

You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

I'm not going to do that, Howard.

I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

What about damsel in distress?

Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

So you're saying, if in the depths of despair
she throws herself at you...

...and demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

- I don't.
- Okay, sorry.

- Wait.
- Wait. Did you say wait?

Tell me the truth.

Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

No, no.

Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

Of course not.

Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

I really thought Mike was different.

I thought he was sensitive and smart.

I mean, not you smart.

- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

...by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

What exactly did this guy write?

Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

I just thought...

Never mind.

No, you know what?

Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

...who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

Oh, God.

Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

Out of curiosity...

...is this subway, the transportation system,
or Subway, the sandwich shop?

Sandwich shop.

Doesn't that violate
the health code or...?

No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

Ah, okay.

But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

Really? Do you think I overreacted?

- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.

- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.

No, that would be under-reacting.

He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

...and in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

Yes, you're right.

I should just say I am done with him.

Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

It's betrayal.

No, you were right the first time.

This is a man who loves me...

...but in his own stupid way was just trying
to show people how he feels.

I'm pretty sure I never said that.

No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

Oh, good for me.

- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.

- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

Huh.

Maybe I am her gay friend.

Howard, I'm going
to need another Mandarin lesson.

I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

For God's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

...don't order tangerine chicken.

I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

Just roll the dice.

"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or..."

She was mad at him.

She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

...and I walked over there and I fixed it.

Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

Just eat your tangerine chicken.

I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

Incredible.

You managed to screw up the screw-up.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

I'm back.

I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

What happened?

Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

Yeah, no, I know that part.

But he had already moved on.

Already? That was quick.

That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.

How could he do that?

Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

Yeah, no, how could he do that?

I swear to God,
I am done with guys like that.

You know, macho with the perfect body,
and the hair and the money.

Yeah, that must get old quick.

You know, just once, I would like to go out
with someone who is nice and honest...

...and who actually cares about me.

[WHIMPERS]

What about me?

What about you what?

[CRYING]

What about if you went out with me?

Are you asking me out?

Um, yes, I am asking you out.

Wow.

I was just going off your comment
about the nice guy...

- No, I got that.
- And honest...

- Yeah, totally.
- So but...

- It's no big deal.
- Yes.

Yes, what?

Yes, I will go out with you.

Really?

Yeah.

Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?

Yeah.

That's the spirit.

Show me your citrus peels.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

Show me your citrus peels.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

- Show me...
- Sheldon?

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

I'm sorry.

Look, do you have a second?

A second what? Pair of underwear?

I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

It's about Leonard.

Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk.

And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

SHELDON:
Yes, I suppose he is.

All I'm saying
is you know Leonard the best.

Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

...but I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

...he can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

...without producing a noxious gas...

...that, I maintain, in the right concentration
could be weaponized.

Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

We're not done?

- No.
- Eh, why not?

We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

Okay, so here's the thing.

I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

Well, he didn't actually say anything.

But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

...that brought to mind
the happy hippos in Fantasia.

Oh, that's nice.

Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

...you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

Wanna sit down?

Oh, I wish it were that simple.

You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

Well, choose.

There are a number of options and...

I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

...air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

No, no, that's crazy.

You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

Okay.

Here's the thing.

So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

A little crush?

Well, I suppose so.

In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

I don't really know who they are...

- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

The point is...

...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

Oh, glare.

But on the other hand...

...if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

I would not say that.

No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

Thank you for the clarification.

Draft.

You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

Right. Thanks.

- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

Okay.

I think this will be my seat.

Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

...with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

Well, let's see.

We might consider SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

SchrÃ¶dinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

Sheldon.

Sorry, you diverted me.

Anyway, in 1935, Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger,
in an attempt to explain...

...the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

...that will break open at a random time.

Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

...until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

Sheldon, what's the point?

Just like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

...right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

No, no, no.

Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger...

Two seats right there.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

...choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

No, it's about Penny.

A mistake involving Penny.

Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

Then don't.

Other people would say, "Why not?"

Other people might be interested.

- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

Then your meal choice is appropriate.

Starch absorbs fluid...

...which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

But go on.

Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

What happens if I blow it?

Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

...that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

...we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

...would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

...from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

You're not helping.

All right, what response on my part...

...would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

Wow, that's brilliant.

You sound surprised.

Mmm.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Come on in.
- Thank you.

You look very nice.

Thank you. So do you.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

I made an 8:00 reservation.

Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

Maybe we should talk first.

Oh.

Okay.

But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of SchrÃ¶dinger's cat?

Actually, I've heard
far too much about SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

Good.

All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

[IN ENGLISH]
Crazy man. Call the police.

[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

Phew!

[English - US - SDH]

So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

- Well, that's very interesting.
- It's also not pink and has no berries.

Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.

- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

Ah.

- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

- So gas.
- Yeah, got it.

Well, good night.

- What are you doing?
- There was a draft.

PENNY:
I didn't feel a draft.

- Why don't we just go into your...?
- Oh, yeah.

Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

No, I know.

I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

Okay. Sure. No problem.

Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

...and when we want to get there?

And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

Solve for R.

Or we could just wing it.

That might work too.

- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

He's coming. Screen saver.

Oh, hey, Leonard.

- How was your date?
- Bite me.

Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

They were clever.

They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.

You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...

...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

...this right here is the black box.

What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

She said she wants to slow things down.

Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

I'm going to slow down and savor it."

No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...

...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?

- Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
- Oh, even I know that's lame.

Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

Where could I have gone wrong?

Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."

Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."

- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, because they don't work.

They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

Sadly, that's my home-run swing.

Look, everything went fine.

I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

That woman across the hall is into me.

Let's go to the tape.

Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.

Nice close-up, by the way.

Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

That's not a bad sign.

Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.

Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

And take down that camera.

He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

Give him time.

- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.

Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

- So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
- Thanks.

Well, good Lord.

Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?

Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

All right, I heard "yes," so...

Okay, here's my question:

Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?

Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

Oh! Well, a few years ago...

...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

- How is that not a brainiac?
- Well, for one thing, she was French.

For another, it was literature.

So...

Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

...he'll eventually get bored with me?

- That depends.
- On what?

Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

No.

Do you speak Klingon?

No.

- You know any card tricks?
- Okay.

I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

Why would you lie about that?

He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?

There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

...who are community-college graduates.

Yeah, but you are neither.

Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.

You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

- You're asking me to keep a secret?
- Yeah.

Well, I'm sorry.

You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.

You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

What?

Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

When I try to deceive...

...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

It's a joke.

It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...

...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.

[CHUCKLES]

I made it up myself.

Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

- Physiologically impossible.
- Oh, Sheldon, please.

Look, I'm asking you as a friend.

You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

- Well, yeah.
- Interesting.

One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

When did we become friends?

I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern...

...unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa.

Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

...I could be Batman.

- You could be Batman?
- Sure.

[IN DEEP VOICE]
I'm Batman.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?

- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

- Hi, Penny.
- Hey.

If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.

You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.

- Okay. What about Saturday?
- You know, I'm not sure.

The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

- Great.
- Okay.

So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so... Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

- What did I do wrong?
- Why are you asking me?

I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

LEONARD: What does that mean?
- Nothing.

You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

- ...where, obviously, none exists.
- No, I didn't.

I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

- What's going on with you?
- Well, I might ask you the same question.

Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...

...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

What's wrong with your face?

There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

- Good day, Leonard.
- What?

I said, good day.

Good day?

Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...

...served with a teriyaki glaze
and sticky rice.

- Our soup of the day...
- You must release me from my oath.

Sheldon, I'm working.

Why don't you take a minute to decide?

I can't keep your secret, Penny.

I'm going to fold like an energy-based
de novo protein in conformational space.

Like a Renaissance triptych.

Like a cheap suit.

Look, why is it so hard
for you to keep one little secret?

I'm constitutionally incapable.

That's why I was refused clearance
for a government research fellowship...

...at a secret military supercollider
beneath a fake agricultural station...

...12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

Which you did not hear about from me.

Look, just forget I told you about me...

...not graduating
from community college, okay?

Forget? You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

I haven't forgotten a thing since the day
my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay.

You promised me
you would keep my secret...

...so you are just gonna have to
figure out a way to do it.

Leonard, I'm moving out.

What do you mean
you're moving out? Why?

There doesn't have to be a reason.

- Yeah, there kind of does.
- Not necessarily.

This is a classic example
of MÃ¼nchausen's trilemma.

Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...

...or it tracks back to axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular...

...i. e., I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

I'm still confused.

Leonard, I don't see
how I could've made it any simpler.

Hey, qu'est-ce que c'up?

We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized cadavers.

Some of those skinless chicks were hot.

If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.

That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

What did you do?

Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the television?

- No.
- Did you take a Band-Aid off...

...in front of him?

- No.
- Did you buy generic ketchup?

Forget to rinse the sink?
Talk to him through the bathroom door?

Adjust the thermostat? Cook with cilantro?
Pronounce the T in "often"?

No.

Did you make fun of trains?

I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

Well, we all knew this day was coming.

That was fast.

It's my pre-packed
disaster evacuation bag.

It's recommended by
the Department of Homeland Security.

And Sarah Connor.

Where are you gonna live?

Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

Bye.

Well... But you can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of manushya yajna...

...one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

I hate trains.

Don't be ridiculous. You love trains.

Yes, I do. Come on.

See you later, Leonard.

This could work.

[INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING
ON TELEVISION]

- This is a very old building.
- Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.

- Uh-oh.
- What?

Don't you worry about the residual radium
from the luminous dials?

Not until now.

I can't believe
I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

Yeah, I had it on my bed,
and I didn't pack it.

- If you're not comfortable staying here...
- I'm kidding. I packed it.

It was a joke. Yeah, I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

I believe they call that
the old switcheroo.

Terrific.

- Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
- Yes. Isn't she an amazing actress?

Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

How dare you?

Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

By comparison, Madhuri Dixit
is a leprous prostitute.

Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Who is it?

RAJESH [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]:
Stripper-gram.

Tag. You're it.

Shouldn't you have put him
in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?

I've never slept on an air mattress before.

No lumbar support whatsoever.

Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench.

I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.

- Do you wanna switch?
- No. That's fine.

I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.

- Get out of bed. We're switching.
- Now, only if you want to.

Just get in the bed.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: What's going on?
Are you boys roughhousing?

We're just talking, Ma.

If you don't settle down right now...

...I'm not gonna let you
have any more sleepovers.

For God's sake, Ma, I'm 27 years old.

And it's not even a school night!

- Comfy now?
- Eh...

That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.

So don't look at it.

- She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.
- No kidding?

Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Eartha Kitt and then her.

- What about Lee Meriwether?
- Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.

Well, I'm glad that's settled.

That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.

Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether...

- Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.
- I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.

Oh, for God's sake.

She's not my favorite of the X-Men.
In order, that'd be Wolverine, Cyclops...

I forgot Professor X.
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman...

...then Storm, Angel, the Bea...
No, wait, Nightcrawler.

Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine,
Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel...

[DOOR KNOCKS]

LEONARD:
I'm coming.

Hey.

There he is.
There's my old buddy-bud-bud.

- What's with him?
- Koothrappali dumped him on me.

He couldn't get to sleep,
so I gave him a glass of milk...

...with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it.

But he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.

I'm back.

- I still don't know why you left.
- I can't tell you.

- Why not?
- I promised Penny.

- Promised Penny what?
- That I wouldn't tell you the secret.

Shh!

What secret? Tell me the secret.

Mom smokes in the car.

Jesus is okay with it,
but we can't tell Dad.

Not that secret, the other secret.

- [IN DEEP VOICE] I'm Batman.
- Damn it, Sheldon.

You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?

[IN NORMAL VOICE] Okay, I'll tell you,
but you can't tell Leonard.

I promise.

Penny lied about graduating
from community college...

...because she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.

So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?

I drank milk that tasted funny.

Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

I know.

Most of your work is extremely derivative.

And don't worry, that's not a secret.

Everybody knows.

- Hi.
- Yeah, hi. Listen.

I know what's been bothering you about us,
and I have the answer.

- What are you talking about?
- I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault.

He tried very hard to keep your secret.

If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.

Now that we know what the problem is,
there's a simple solution.

- Pasadena City College?
- A place for fun, a place for knowledge.

See, this man here is playing Hacky Sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

Oh. I get it,
because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter...

...can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

Well, it's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

Right, but I have to have
some sort of degree to date you?

- That doesn't matter to me at all.
- So it's fine with you if I'm not smart?

Absolutely.

Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

Bite me.

[English - US - SDH]

Worst Renaissance fair ever.

Please let it go, Sheldon.

SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...

...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or Reinheitsgebot...

...severely limited the availability
of mead.

At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.

LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh, really?

Well, here's another nit for you.

The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.

Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...

...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...

...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.

If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.

I just wanna be part of the conversation.

Hi, guys.

Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

I'm hoping.

Renaissance fair?

More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...

...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.

- Hello.
ERIC: Hey.

So, yeah, good to see you.

Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.

- We should probably go.
- Yeah.

- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.

Thanks, my mom made it.

Penny with a new guy. TrÃ¨s awkward.

It wasn't awkward.

It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?

We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...

...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

That was not 15th-century soap.

My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde"...

...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

You're wearing modern underwear?

Relatively modern.

What are you wearing?

I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

You went and bought linen?

Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

Borrowed?

You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

It gives me freedom to move on myself.

Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

Of course. Out of respect.

So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?

Who were you respecting then?

What? I've dated plenty of women.

There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle...

Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:

The word "plenty"
has been redefined to mean "two."

What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?

- It doesn't count.
- Why not?

What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.

You're only saying that
because of what happened.

- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

It wasn't your fault, Raj.

He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.

- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.

It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.

- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.

But she defected back to North Korea...

...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.

- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy...

...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...

...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

Mud.

Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...

...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.

Yeah? So? Be a tool.

Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.

It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?

I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

And he told me his name was Kimberly.

You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?

How?

If we were, the food would be better.

Hey, Leonard.

- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

Hello to you,
insufficiently intelligent person.

Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.

Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...

...I'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...

...as opposed to what you do,
which does not.

Yeah, you heard me.

Wow.

So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...

...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

"Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.

Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."

Anyway, it got me thinking.

Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

No, I'm all done with casual sex.

I'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.

Really? What changed?

There's just a time
in every woman's life...

...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...

...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

Yeah, I can see how that would...
A bunch of people?

Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...

...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

I'm flattered.

So how do you suggest we proceed?

Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.

Then light petting, no coitus.

- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.

I think it's better
if you assume the male role.

Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

Great.

Call me.

Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

LEONARD:
Oh.

- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.

- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.

We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.

The thing is, someone's coming over.

Well, no problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.

Oh.

Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.

Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

- Well, statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.

Nevertheless, I have one now...

...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.

I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...

...and an IQ which can't be measured
by normal tests.

How much scarcer could I be?

You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

You mean just go someplace else
and be...

...someplace else?

- Yes.
- But why should I leave?

- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.

If science ever discovers a second member
of your species...

...and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be happy to get out of your way.

Well, all right, then.

Sheldon? What are you doing?

Playing "Super Mario"
on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.

But why are you doing it on the stairs?

I am a modern-day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase...

...because Leonard, get this, has a date.

Oh. Oh, well, good for him.

Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?

Alone?

- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?

Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

- Then don't order popcorn.
- No popcorn at the mov...?

Listen to yourself.

- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.

They have other things.

- What do they have?
- I don't know. You know, cookies, pastries...

- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.

I don't like bear claws.

Hey, Penny. Dumb-ass.

Leslie Winkle.

Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world...

...why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?

Well, they have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.

Please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science...

...would be if they resumed sending chimps
into space.

Okay, well, I have a date too,
so I'll see you.

Everybody has a date.

Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.

And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.

- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.

- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.

- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.

So how many children
do you think we should have?

[COUGHING]

I'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.

A little.

There are so many things to talk about
before reproduction.

I sure hope so.

Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?

I'm sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying. Continue.

Uh, genetic weaknesses, right.
Um, there's the lactose intolerance.

Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.

When his uncles sit around the dinner
table, they look like a half-carton of eggs.

Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald...

...but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest
women you'll ever meet, so, you know...

Sweet lady.
It always tickles when she hugs me.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.

I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

He can be a bit of an eccentric.

If by "eccentric"...

...you mean "passive-aggressive
East Texas blowhole," I agree.

Well, I think tonight
was a very good start.

Me too. You're sure you're okay
postponing intercourse...

...until our relationship
is past the initial viability test?

No problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.

I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.

I believe protocol dictates
that you wait a minimum of 18 hours...

...before you call so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.

- Sure.
- Again, it's your decision. You're the man.

PENNY:
No, it wasn't my cat.

It was an experiment designed
by this guy named SchrÃ¶dinger.

From the Charlie Brown cartoons?

No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.

- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hello.

- Leslie.
LESLIE: Hi.

Okay, well, good night.

Okay, well, good night.

That ain't gonna make your point.

Okay, okay, that's enough.

Call me.

Right.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Well, okay, good night.

- What?
- Had a great time. Ciao.

I'm sorry, I am not going back
to the Renaissance fair.

Come on, Sheldon.

There are so few places
I can wear my jester costume.

I don't care. There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.

Oh, okay, how about this?

You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer...

...exploring a planet similar to Earth
in the 1500s.

You mean like Spock?

Sure.

Fascinating.

- Hey, fellow scientists. Sheldon.
LEONARD: Mm.

Why don't we move there
so Leslie can join us?

Yeah, let's do it.

If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit...

...I suggest One Potato, Two Potato...

...or as I call it, the Leslie Winkle
Experimental Methodology.

- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard. It's simple.

You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate...

...or you can sit with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.

You're right, it is simple.

- Hey, Sheldon.
SHELDON: Penny.

Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?

Oh.

I still don't understand
why you don't just go to dinner.

All right, let's say I go to dinner alone...

...and during the meal
I have to use the restroom.

How do I know
someone's not touching my food?

Good night, Sheldon.

Penny, hold on.

You sure things can't work out
with you and Leonard?

Excuse me?

I'm just wondering
if you really gave it the old college try.

Or in your case,
the old community-college try.

Okay, where is this coming from?

Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.

- Your archenemy?
- Yes, the Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.

The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man.

- The Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel...
- Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.

It's amazing how many super villains
have advanced degrees.

Graduate schools should do a better job
of screening those people out.

Sheldon, come back. You're losing me.

It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.

Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

She called me "dumb-ass."

I know, I heard.

Given the situation...

...I have no choice
but to withdraw my previous objections...

...to your ill-considered relationship
with Leonard.

Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.

But, um, I think for now
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.

No. That response is unacceptable to me.

- You are a smart guy. You must know...
- I'm smart?

I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."

- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.

You must know that if Leonard and Leslie
wanna be together...

...nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.

Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend...

...you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.

Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?

If Leonard's really my friend...

...why doesn't he have to support me
in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?

Because love trumps hate.

Oh, now you're just making stuff up.

Okay. Good night, Sheldon.

Oh, Mario.

If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.

Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.

When the two of you reach a natural
stopping point, I'd like to have a word.

If the word is "pee-pee," just do it.

Leonard, you're my friend...

...and friends support their friends,
apparently.

So I am withdrawing my objection...

...to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.

- Thank you.
- I will graciously overlook the fact...

...that she is an arrogant,
subpar scientist...

...who believes loop quantum gravity
better unites quantum mechanics...

...with general relativity
than does string theory.

You kids have fun.

Hang on a second.

Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.

I'm listening. Amuse me.

Okay, well, for one thing,
we expect quantized space-time...

...to manifest as minute differences
in the speed of light for different colors.

Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

Are you gonna let him talk to me
like that?

Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.

No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity
calculates the entropy of black holes.

[SNORTS]

Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

You agree with me, right?

Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.

Well, I'm glad I found out the truth
about you before this went any further.

Truth? What truth?

We're talking about untested hypotheses...
Look, it's no big deal.

Oh, it isn't? Really?

Tell me, Leonard,
how will we raise the children?

I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

We can't let them choose, Leonard,
they're children.

Wait, where are you going?

I'm sorry.

I could've accepted our kids
being genetically unable to eat ice cream...

...or ever get a good view of a parade.

But this? This is a deal breaker.

Look on the bright side.

- What's the bright side?
- Only nine more months to Comic-Con.

Oh, yeah.

[WHIRRING]

Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.

Yeah, that's great.
You guys want corn dogs?

Yeah.

That's a temporal anomaly.

Corn dogs didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.

[English - US - SDH]

Fellow warriors,
this is Sheldor the Conqueror.

We are about to enter Atzel's fortress.

Now, this is a long run,
so let's do another bladder check.

All right, Barry, we'll wait for you again,
but you really should see a doctor.

[BANGING NEARBY]

Sheldor is AFK.

Penny, are you experiencing
some sort of difficulty?

Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.

You appear to have put your car key
in the door lock. Are you aware of that?

Yeah.

All right, then.

PENNY:
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

Would it be possible for you
to do this a little more quietly?

- I can't get the damn key out.
- That's not surprising.

That Baldwin lock on your door uses
traditional edge-mounted cylinders...

...whereas the key for your Volkswagen
uses a center-cylinder system.

Thank you, Sheldon.

You're welcome.

Point of inquiry: Why did you
put your car key in the door lock?

I'll tell you why.
Today I had an audition.

It took me two hours to get there.
I waited an hour for my turn.

Before I could start, they told me
I look too Midwest for the part.

Too Midwest.
What the hell does that even mean?

The American Midwest was mostly settled
by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples...

- ...who have characteristic facial...
- I know what it means.

God, I have been in L.A.
for almost two years now.

I haven't gotten a single acting job.
I've accomplished nothing.

Haven't gotten a raise at work.
Haven't even had sex in six months.

And when I was walking up those stairs
a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.

Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple
in many cultures.

They're almost pure protein.

Oh, son of a bitch.

The condensation on your frozen foods...

...weakened the structural integrity
of the bag.

But returning to your key conundrum,
you should call a locksmith.

- Have him open the door for you.
- I did.

He said he'll get here when he gets here.

You're frustrated because he phrased
his reply in a meaningless tautology?

No. I am frustrated
because I am a failure at everything...

...and my breath smells like fly.

[CRYING]

There, there.

Would you prefer to wait
in our apartment?

No, I'd rather sit on this freezing floor,
sobbing like a 3-year-old.

All right, then.

For God's sake.

Just when I think I've gotten
the hang of sarcasm.

Make yourself comfortable.

Not there.

[SCOFFS]

Sheldor is back online.

Sheldor?

The Conqueror.

What are you doing?

AFK.

I'm playing "Age of Conan,"
an online multiplayer game...

...set in the universe of Robert E. Howard's
Conan the Barbarian.

Oh.

Sheldor back online.

- What's AFK?
- AFK.

Away from keyboard.

Oh, I see.

What does that stand for?

Oh, I see.

Yes, but what does it stand for?

And just click on the enchanted boots
to put them on.

I don't know.
Can I see them in another color?

Just click on them.

Now, congratulations,
you are now a level-three warrior.

- What's going on?
- Guess what? I'm a level-three warrior.

Do you know there are groceries
outside of your apartment?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shh.

I only bring it up because your ice cream's
melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.

Uh-huh. Do I stay in the jungle
or go towards the beach?

- Doesn't matter, you're looking for treasure.
- Okay.

- Wait, where are you going?
- Go ahead. You're okay.

If you run into crocodiles,
just kick them with your boots.

Wanna catch me up?

Well, uh, let's see. She attempted
to open her apartment with her car key...

...because her face is overly Midwestern.
Uh...

She hasn't had sex in six months.

And she ate a fly.

Uh-huh.

Seriously, six months?

Oh, my God, a treasure chest. I'm rich.

Level three and she thinks she's rich.

What a newb.

Okay, we're all set.

Let her rip.

- Hi.
- Hey, check it out.

It's just corn starch and water.

They make up a non-Newtonian fluid
which is liquid...

...but solid under the percussive action
of the speaker.

That's what makes it get all funky.

Yeah, okay.

Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.

No, that's what she said, Sheldon.

Okay, I bought the game and I've been
exploring the Island of Tortage.

I can't figure how to pass the guard.

- Do you have the enchanted sword?
- I have a bronze dagger.

You can't slay the guard with a dagger.

Lord, it's like the car key
in your apartment door all over again.

- How do I get the sword?
- Have you been to the Temple of Mitra?

- Is that the place on the hill with the priest?
- No, it's...

Oh, for God's sakes, give me.

Thank you. I really appreciate this.

You have to learn to do these things.

Don't patronize me. Just get the sword.

What the frak?

Beats me.
They were playing all last night too.

It's like some kind
of weird comic-book crossover.

Like if Hulk
were dating Peppermint Patty.

I always thought Peppermint Patty
was a lesbian.

No, that's Marcie.

Peppermint Patty's just athletic.

There you go, one enchanted sword.

All right, give me, give me.
I wanna kill the guard captain.

That girl needs to get a life.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Sheldon.

- Sheldon.
- Danger. Danger.

No danger, it's me, Penny.

Listen, I got to level 25
and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?

- You're in my bedroom.
- Yeah.

- Leonard gave me an emergency key.
- People can't be in my bedroom.

- Can we go talk in the living room?
- I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

- Why not?
- I spilled grape juice.

Well, wear different pajamas.

Can't wear different pajamas.
These are my Monday pajamas.

Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.

Just tell me, is it too soon
to join a quest to the Black Castle?

You were invited on a quest
to the Black Castle?

By some guys in Budapest. I'm just not
sure it's the right move for my character.

Of course it's not. You're only a level 25.

These Hungarians are just using you
for dragon fodder.

Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust
a horde of Hungarian Barbarians.

SHELDON:
Please, Penny, enough. I have to sleep.

PENNY:
Okay, well, you were great. Thanks.

Oh. Listen, don't go in Sheldon's room.
He's not wearing bottoms.

[KNOCKING]

Sheldon, you wanna catch me up again?

People, I am very busy today.

I realize that, but it is your job
as head of the department...

...to mediate all intra-departmental
disputes.

University Policy Manual, Chapter 4,
subsection 2:

"Mediation
of Intra-departmental Disputes."

[SCOFFS]

Fine.

Dr. Winkle, what colorful name
did you call Dr. Cooper this time?

Dr. Dumb-ass.

Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winkle apologizes.

- No, she doesn't.
- No, I don't.

Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up
to use the mainframe in Buckman 204...

...and Dr. Winkle just ripped
the sign-up sheet off the wall.

It wasn't an official sign-up sheet.
He printed it...

...and he put his name down
on every slot for the next six months.

If it is a crime to ensure
the university's resources...

...are not being squandered
chasing subatomic wild geese...

...then I plead guilty.

[PHONE RINGING]

Oh, Penny.

- You need to get that, Dr. Cooper?
- God, no.

Don't turn it off. You might miss
your call from Nobel...

...letting you know you've been nominated
as dumb-ass laureate of the year.

Oh, yeah, well,
you wouldn't even be nominated.

I have a series of important multi-loop
calculations and simulations to run.

She's reducing irrelevant data,
making a mock...

[PHONE RINGS]

Excuse me.

Gablehauser.

It's for you.

Hello?

Penny, this is not a good time.

No, I told you, you're not prepared
for the Sanctum of Burning Souls.

You need to be in a group of at least five
and one should be a level 35 healer.

No, I can't log on and help you.

We'll talk when I get home.

I'm not getting the computing time,
am I?

Dumb-ass.

Leonard, you have to do something
about Penny.

She is interfering with my sleep.
She is interfering with my work.

If I had another significant aspect
of my life...

...I'm sure she'd be interfering
with that too.

Why should I do something?
You introduced her to online gaming.

Well, yes, but you're the one
who said hello to her when she moved in.

If you'd simply restrained yourself,
none of this would be happening.

- Well, just tell her to leave you alone.
- I did. I told her. I texted her.

I sent out a very emphatic Twitter.

I changed my Facebook status to "Sheldon
wishes Penny would leave him alone."

I don't know what else to do.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

If you don't figure something out,
I warn you...

...I shall become very difficult
to live with.

You mean, up until now we've been
experiencing the happy fun-time Sheldon?

- Yes.
- I'll go talk to her.

No, Fritz, I need you on my flank.

No, I don't know German.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey, Penny?
- Busy.

Yeah, I see that.
Shouldn't you be at work?

I don't work on Mondays.

It's Thursday.

- Listen, Penny...
- Ugh. Queen Penelope AFK. What?

Okay. Uh...

Here's the thing.

Um, sometimes people, good people,
you know, they start playing these games.

They find themselves, through no fault
of their own, you know, kind of addicted.

Yeah, get to the point.
I'm about to level up here.

If a person doesn't have a sense
of achievement in their real life...

...it's easy to lose themselves in a world
where a false sense of accomplishment...

Yeah, jabber, jabber, jabber.
Okay, boys, Queen Penelope's back online.

Penny, you've got...

...Cheetos in your hair.

Oh, thanks.

Wow.

LEONARD:
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

PENNY:
Leonard, I said, not now.

LEONARD: I'm just a little concerned
about you and...

PENNY:
I said, not now.

LEONARD:
Okay, maybe later.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

- Hey, what's with him?
- Penny's been keeping him up at night.

Me too.

But probably in a different way.

She's really hooked on "Age of Conan."
She's playing non-stop.

Oh, yes, online gaming addiction.

There's nothing worse than having
that multiplayer monkey on your back.

- Sheldon, wake up.
- Danger, danger.

Afternoon, men. Sheldon.

Oh, yeah, well, your attempt
at juvenilizing me...

...by excluding me from the set of adult
males just... Oh, I'm too tired to do this.

Right. I heard you've been pulling
all-nighters with Middle-Earth Barbie.

She comes into my room.
No one's supposed to be in my room.

I would postulate
she's escaping into the online world...

...to compensate
for her sexual frustration.

I do that too.

But probably in a different way.

That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

She's trying to shore up her self-esteem.
It has nothing to do with sex.

Everything has to do with sex.

Mm. Testify.

I'm not touching that.

- Leslie, you are way off base here.
- Now, hang on, Leonard.

While I have no respect for Leslie as a
scientist or a human being for that matter...

...we have to concede
her undeniable expertise...

...in the interrelated fields of promiscuity
and general sluttiness.

Thank you.

My point is that Tinkerbell
just needs to get her some.

Some what?
Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

I'll take the bullet.

- Excuse me, this whole idea's insane.
- Enough debate. I'm going to take action.

Excuse me.

Are you currently involved
in a sexual relationship?

- No.
- Would you like to be?

Uh...

Sure, why not?

- Sheldon...
- Yip, yip, yip.

Can I have your phone number?

Uh...

Yeah.

Yeah.

There, problem solved.

Dumb-ass.

Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury
of the Ancients. I'm going in.

- Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
- Got it.

I must say, you're playing very well
for a woman of 23?

- Twenty-two.
- Right, 22.

Here come the mummies. Which spell do I
use? The hateful strike or the frenzy stance?

- What happened to your group?
- Dumped them. They're a bunch of wussies.

Frenzy stance.

Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy.

So listen,
would you describe your ideal vacation...

...as a wild adventure to unknown lands
or staying at home with a good book?

- Wait, what?
- These are market-research questions.

I'm filling out the online registration
for your game.

Oh, okay, wild adventure.

Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.

- Die, you undead mummy, die!
- Drink a healing potion.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Anyhow, on a scale of one to five...

...with one being, "always initiated by him"
and five being, "always initiated by you"...

...how do you prefer
your sexual encounters to begin?

That's on the registration?

Oh, yes, it's quite extensive.

If we complete it,
you get a free expansion pack.

Seventy-five additional quests.

Oh, awesome. Okay, I totally like to initiate.
I'm a big old five.

Good to know.

Big old five.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Leonard, this is Tom.

Hi, Tom. Sheldon.

Didn't I explain to you
about your little mistake in the cafeteria?

Yes, you were very clear,
as was everyone else at the table.

Tom, however, has been chosen by science
as a suitable mate for Penny.

Chosen by science.

Well, what passes for science
on dating sites.

They may claim to use heuristic algorithms,
but it may well be hokum.

You got Penny to sign up
for online dating?

No, no, of course not.
No, see, I used trickery and deceit.

This is bad.

Tom is a paramedic
with the fire department.

He's going to med school.

Uh, he likes the outdoors
and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.

Really, really bad.

I'm surprised you struck out with Penny.
Apparently, she's a big old five.

- Sheldon, what do you want?
- Oh, good, you got my note.

Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom.
Uh, Penny, this is Tom.

- Tom, may I present Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

Hi, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with
newbs, don't know what they're doing.

Got one assassin, three spell casters,
no tank.

- Can we talk later?
- No, I need you now.

Wouldn't you prefer
to socialize with Tom...

...who is a sexually passive
outdoorsman?

- Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.
- Bye, Penny.

I'm sorry, dude,
she didn't look anything like her picture.

They never do.

HOWARD:
Hello, fair Penny.

PENNY: Who are you?
HOWARD: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.

Can I interest you
in an afternoon of spirited questing...

...followed by a flagon of ale
at yon virtual tavern?

PENNY:
Yeah, sure, why not?

Oh, my God, I need help.

[English - US - SDH]

Let's see, Raj was the kung pao chicken.

- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

Creepy, Howard.

Creepy good or creepy bad?

- Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
- That would be me.

Come to Papa, you un-kosher delight.

I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

Sit over there.

Sit over there.

- Baby wipe?
- Why do you have...?

- No, don't ask.
- No, don't, don't.

I'll tell you why.

[BOTH SIGH]

I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

- Why?
- Really, don't.

Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

...sneeze my hands dry.

Hey, guys.
I just got the most amazing new...

Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.

Between him not talking,
him talking, and him...

...I'm better off alone.

So goodbye, you poor, strange little man.

- She's so considerate.
- So, what's your news?

Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

Anyway, because of my discovery...

...People magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

- Raj, that's incredible.
- Congratulations.

Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film Juno.

Oh, I'd so do her.

You'd do the dolphins.

Do I get a mention...

...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

It's a lease.

I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

...to determine which scientists
would be included?

Peer review? It's People magazine.
People picked me.

- What people?
- The people from People.

What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

...that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years...

...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

Boy, I bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

You proud of yourself?

In general, yes.

Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

...weren't you,
you little subatomic dickens?

- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.

Oh, good,
we can take it off the milk carton.

We're gonna apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

Apologize? For what?

He came over last night with some pretty
good news and we weren't very supportive.

I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

You were a colossal asshat.

Oh, no, I beg to differ.

Of the three of us,
I was by far the most supportive.

Really? Do tell.

How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

Okay, let's try it this way.

What if this People magazine thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

- I had not considered that.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

I often forget
other people have limitations.

It's so sad.

- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

It's what you and I call condescension.

Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

But I'm not.

Well, then fake it. Look at me.

I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

But I'm bigger than that.

Fine. What do you want me to do?

Smile.

Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

Try less teeth.

Close enough. Come on.

- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

We wanted to invite you
out to dinner tonight.

Celebrate your 30 Under 30 thing.
Right, Sheldon?

- It's very nice of you. I would like that.
- Hello, boys.

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Koothrappali.

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Hofstadter.

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Mr. Wolowitz.

Boys, I got a question for you.
Who in this room discovered a star?

Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17
is a planetary body.

I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

You, my exotic young friend, are my star.

But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

...much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.

- Sheldon.
- Ugh. Sorry.

Boy, we gotta get you into a better office.
Something more suited to your status.

- You don't have to go to trouble.
- How about von Gerlach's old office?

- I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.

He gets a new office, I can't get
paper towels in the men's room?

- Sheldon.
- Damn, this is hard.

Let me ask you, what do you think
the business of this place is?

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

- Science?
- Money.

Told you.

And this boy's picture
in People magazine...

...is gonna raise us
a pile of money taller than...

Well, taller than you.

- I have a master's degree.
- Who doesn't?

Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

I didn't even know
there was a president's dining room.

It's the same food as the cafeteria,
only fresh.

- Come on, little buddy.
- Okay, big buddy.

See you tonight, guys.

- You can stop smiling now.
- Ah.

So anyway, after a fantastic lunch...

...I was whisked off
to the People magazine photo shoot...

- Have any of you been to a photo shoot?
HOWARD: No.

It's fantastic.

Apparently, the camera loves me,
and I it.

They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this:

They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.

They gave him an assistant?

If I want a new pen,
I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

Not yet.

Okay, put it on my calendar, but start
thinking of a reason why I can't go.

Alrighty? Koothrappali out.

God bless that boy.

- Don't know what I'd do without him.
- You just got him this afternoon.

Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

- A lackey?
- I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect?

In India, we just call them untouchables.

- Now?
- Almost.

Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

People magazine is having a reception
Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.

- Oh, gee, thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section...

...because, you know, that's for VIPs,
and you guys are just, you know, P's.

There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea...

...where when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village...

...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.

Here you go, Raj.
You might wanna drink this one slowly.

Okay. So Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.

Oh, okay. Leonard?

Well, uh...

No, I could... No.

- Sheldon?
- I can make it, but I won't.

- What are you talking about?
- The reception for my article on Saturday.

You guys aren't going?

I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.

You're not gonna be there?

A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...

...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine...

...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

Would you like to go with me?

Of course I would. I would be honored.

Really? Cool.

Shame on you guys.

Look at that, I got a date with Penny.

I can't believe it took you a whole year.

- Now?
- Now.

Hey, buddy.
I'm gonna be in People magazine.

Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

Oh, Raj, look at you.

I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.

I just love saying "limo." Here.

- Sip on this while you're getting ready.
- Oh, I'm ready.

That's what you're wearing?

Um, yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

Nothing. I was just hoping for something
a little more, you know, ridonkulous.

Yeah. Well, this is all the "donkulous"
you're gonna get tonight.

Okey-dokey. Let's roll.

All right, it's time to raise the roof.
Ooh-ooh.

Hey, Leonard.

- Hey.
- Dude.

- You look very nice.
BOTH: Thank you.

- Come on. Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

- Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs?
- Yeah.

It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

- Terrific.
- It has more food too.

All right. Come on, come on.

RAJESH [SINGING]:
I'm coming up

So you better get this party started

I'm coming up
I'm coming up, yeah

I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

- Hey.
- Hey, good news.

You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

"Anything-for-a-Green-Card.com"?

I'll lend you my username.
It's Wealthy Big Penis.

- You're joking.
- You gotta make it easy for them.

They're just learning English.

Pass.

You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...

...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?

It's not a date and that's racist.

It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on The Simpsons.

Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?

- Yes.
- Even though the menu specifies shredded?

- Yes.
- Brown rice, not white?

- Yes.
- Did you stop and get the hot mustard?

- Yes.
- Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?

- Yes.
- Thank you.

You're welcome.

What took you so long?

- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

I want you to check
before you accept the order.

Sorry.

Were you distracted
by the possibility...

...that Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.

Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.

Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.

That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region...

...home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

No.

Anyway, when I was 8...

...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.

- "Lucky"?
- Yes, "Lucky."

He's irony impaired. Just move on.

Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.

While others mourned Lucky...

...I realized his untimely demise provided
me with the opportunity to replace him...

...with something
more suited to my pet needs.

A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...

...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

So not a puppy?

Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.

I wanted a griffin.

- A griffin?
- Yes, half eagle, half lion.

And mythological.

Irrelevant.

Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...

...and I was confidant
I could create one...

...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.

Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story...

...but what's your point?

My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

You wanna breed a new friend?

That's one option, but who has the time?

But consider this.

The Japanese, they're doing some
wonderful work with artificial intelligence.

Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.

Next thing you know, we're playing "Halo"
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.

For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.

They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

You know, a guy who has your back.

He should have money and live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.

- He should share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.

Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

RAJESH [SINGING]:
I can go all night

If you know what I mean

Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

Yes, it's very nice. Good night, Raj.

- Wait, the evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

Oh, wow, is the evening over.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

Wait, wait, wait. That's my mommy
and daddy calling from India.

I want you to meet my parents.

Wait, meet them?

Hello, Mommy, Daddy. Good to see you.
How are you? I'm not drunk.

- Why would you say that?
- Just making conversation.

Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet
my new squeeze, Penny.

I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

I can't see her. Center her in the frame.

Here you go. Cute, huh?

She's not Indian.

So she's not Indian.
The boy's sowing some wild oats.

No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

What if he gets her pregnant?

Is this hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?

What right do you have
to pick whom I can have children with?

Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America...

...you want to try the "local cuisine."

But trust me,
you don't want it for a steady diet.

Now, you listen to me. I am no longer
a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

- What's wrong with him?
PENNY: I don't know.

Maybe it's the local cuisine.

Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

Just gonna set you on down over here.

And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

She's feisty.

I like that.

[SHUFFLING]

Raj, what are you doing?

No, no notes.
If you have something to say to me, say it.

[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Sorry.

Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

[English - US - SDH]

[GROANS]

[SIGHS]

- Good morning, Leonard.
- Aah!

- Uh-huh.
- We have to stop by Pottery Barn...

...on the way to work.
I bought these Star Wars sheets.

They turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night's sleep.

I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

I'm not going to work.

Just because your career's been stagnant
for a few years, that's no reason to give up.

Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser...

...for my x-ray-diffraction experiment.

Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

- No.
- Then you can drive. Let's go.

[LEONARD SIGHS]

Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
you'd have to make other arrangements?

- You did.
- And?

I didn't.

Let's go.

Good night, Sheldon.

- But how am I going to get to work?
- Take the bus.

But I can't take the bus.
They don't have seat belts.

And they won't let you lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

You tried to lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

I didn't try, I succeeded.

But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.

Oh, you're a big boy. You'll figure it out.

Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

Now take me
to return my Star Wars sheets.

Penny?

Penny? Penny?

Sheldon, what is it?

Leonard's asleep.

Thanks for the update.

No, wait.

You have to drive me to work.

Yeah, I really don't think I do.

But I don't drive
and I can't take the bus.

You'll be fine as long as
you don't do that bungee thing.

Penny.

Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.

Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand...

...is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

The favor.

Oh, dear God.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

When you're done, we'll go.

Thank you for driving me to work.

You know this is my day off, Sheldon?

Oh, good,
I'm not keeping you from anything.

- Your check-engine light is on.
- Mm-hm.

Typically that's an indicator to,
you know, check your engine.

It's fine. It's been on for like a month.

Well, actually, that would be all the more
reason to, you know, check your engine.

- Sheldon, it's fine.
- If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on.

That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

Maybe the light's broken.

Is there
a check-the-check-engine-light light?

Oh.

What?

Studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating, talking on a phone...

...or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one's reaction time...

...by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

- Do you have any alcohol?
- Of course not.

Too bad.

- You're going up Euclid Avenue?
- Mm-hm.

Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

Well, good for Leonard.

Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies,
but it has speed bumps...

...which increase point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

But you have the con.

Oh!

If you're not going to slow down for
the speed bumps, I withdraw my objection.

Here's a fun question.

Do you know
what the most common street name is?

- No.
- The answer's tricky.

It's Second Street.

You'd think it would be First Street.

In most towns, First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

Like Main Street...

...Broad Street...

...Michigan Avenue.

Leonard and I
often use our commute time...

...to exercise our minds
with brain teasers like that.

We also play games.

Would you like to play one?

- No.
- Oh, come on, it's fun.

Whoo! Another bump.

Okay. Uh, I'll say an element
and, uh, you say an element...

...whose name starts
with the last letter of the one I said, okay?

I'll start.

"Helium."

Now, you could say, "Mercury."

That would give me a Y.

Ooh, very clever. That's a tough one.

So I go with "ytterbium"...

...which gets you back to M.

So you go, "Molybdenum."

And I say, "Magnesium."

And you say, "Manganese."

And I say, "Europium."

And you're left with "mendelevium."

And there are no more M's,
because I believe that meitnerium...

...should still be called eka-iridium.
So congratulations, you win.

Do you wanna go again?

How about we just have
a little quiet time now?

All right.

[SHELDON WHIMPERS]

I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance...

...regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.

Get out.

I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding...

...of an internal-combustion engine...

...I'm not sure
I'm capable of performing diagnostics.

I said, "Get out."

Okay, I'll give it a shot.

Oh, Leonard, there you are.

I'm ready to go home.

I just got here.

Good. Perfect timing.

Sheldon, I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

- I can't drive you for the next few weeks.
- No.

You said you couldn't drive me to work.
This is from work.

Howard, help me out here.

No, just for the fun of it,
I'm gonna take his side.

Now, how do you propose I get home?

- How did you get here in the first place?
- Penny.

But I sense that's no longer an option.

Look, I need to get to the laser lab.

You're just gonna have to find
someone else to take you home.

Oh, damn. I picked the wrong side.

[SCREAMING]

Oh, God, not Euclid Avenue.

[SCREAMING]

Why did Howard leave you
in the middle of the road, anyway?

We had a difference of opinion.

Over what?

Whether or not he was trying to kill me.

For the record, I maintain he was.

- Where are you going?
- I'm taking you home.

But I'm not going home. It's Wednesday.

Wednesday is New Comic Book Day.
We have to go to the comic-book store.

And then we have to stop at Souplantation.
It's Creamy Tomato Soup Day.

And RadioShack.
There's a sale on triple-A batteries.

We have to go to Pottery Barn
and return my Star Wars sheets.

I have a better idea.

You wanna go to Pottery Barn first?

Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

Maybe if I turn off the nightlight,
I can keep the sheets.

Good morning.

ALL:
Good morning.

Sheldon, sit down.

She's in my spot.

Don't look at me like that.
Everybody knows that's my spot.

Sheldon...

...you know that we care about you.

And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

So we made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

"Department of Motor Vehicles
New Driver Handbook"?

But I don't have a problem.

Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.

This madness has to stop.

Penny's taking you to the DMV.
I'm going to bed.

- Why Penny?
- Because rock breaks scissors.

Good night.

- All right. Come on, Sheldon.
- Hold on.

I've one condition.

- What?
- We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

Okay.

And RadioShack.

Fine.

- And the comic-book store.
PENNY: All right.

I wanna go to the comic-book store.

I like comic books.

I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

Albert Einstein
never had a driver's license.

Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me
wet myself at 40 miles an hour.

Yeah, and I never wanted
to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.

You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just
get a license at 16 like everybody else?

I was otherwise engaged.

Doing what?

Examining perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories...

...leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties...

...of multi-loop N=8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

Well, how about when you were 17?

Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

Sign the bottom, answer
the questions, bring it back. Next.

Application?

I'm actually more of a theorist.

The application in your hand.
Give it to her.

Oh.

Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

Sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

Excuse me, but I have some concerns
about these questions.

Look at that sign up there.

- Yes?
- Does it say, "I give a damn"?

- No.
- That's because I don't.

Just look.
See, this first question makes no sense.

Look, "How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"

There's no possible way to answer that.

A car length is not
a standardized unit of measure.

Look at the sign.

- Sheldon, it's C. Just put down C.
- I don't need your help, Penny.

- Listen to that little girl, honey. Put C. Next.
SHELDON: No, no.

Wait, no, hang on.
Take a look at this next question.

Sheldon,
why are you arguing with the DMV?

How else are they going to learn?

Look, question two:

"When are roadways most slippery?"

There are three answers,
none of which are correct.

The correct answer is, "When covered by
liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient...

...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.

But not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

Here's your learner's permit. Go away.

But I'm not done. I have many
additional concerns about these questions.

- Don't make me climb over this counter.
- All right, come on. Let's go.

WOMAN:
Next.

Aced it.

Okay. That's it. Let's boot it up.

Booting.

This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

I adapted it from something
a friend designed for the Army.

Is that why I appear to be in Fallujah...

...behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

I haven't configured it yet.

Let's see. Bradley tank.
Transport truck. Batmobile.

- Ooh!
- No.

Here we go. Red 2006 Ford Taurus
on the streets of Pasadena.

Uh...

- What?
- Statistically, red cars...

...are stopped by police
far more often than any other color.

I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

Fine, what color do you want?

You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

Before it was digitally remastered.

Black it is.

Okay. Now, what you wanna do first
is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.

I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

Okay, fasten your seat belt.

Click.

- Are there air bags?
- You don't need air bags.

What if a simulated van rear-ends me?

I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.

[ENGINE STARTS ON SIMULATOR]

Okay, now shift into drive.

And pull out slowly into traffic.

[TIRES SCREECHING ON SIMULATOR]

Do you...? Watch the...

- Watch out for the pedestrians!
- Oh, God, wait.

[GIRL SCREAMS ON SIMULATOR]

Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

[TIRES SCREECH ON SIMULATOR]

[CAR CRASHES ON SIMULATOR]

Thank you.

[CAR CRASHES THEN MAN YELLS
ON SIMULATOR]

Sorry. Excuse me.

[TIRES SCREECH THEN CAR CRASHES
ON SIMULATOR]

My bad.

[TIRES SCREECH THEN GLASS SHATTERS
ON SIMULATOR]

Student driver.

How did you manage to get on
the second floor of the Glendale Galleria?

I don't know.

I was on the Pasadena Freeway,
and missed my exit...

...flew off the overpass,
and one thing led to another.

Maybe you wanna give it a rest
and try again tomorrow.

No. I quit.

[CAR CRASHES AND MAN SCREAMS
ON SIMULATOR]

[CROWD CLAMORING ON SIMULATOR]

[ANIMALS CHIRPING AND WHIMPERING
ON SIMULATOR]

Oh. The pet store?

Remind me to compliment Wolowitz
on the software. It's amazingly detailed.

So wait. You're just gonna give up?

No, I'm not giving up.

No, I never give up.

So, what is it you're doing?

I'm, uh, transcending the situation.

I'm clearly too evolved for driving.

- What does that mean?
- Leonard...

...have you ever wondered
why my little toes and lateral incisors...

...are significantly smaller
than the average for someone of my size?

I wonder a lot of things about you,
Sheldon, but not that.

Well, those are indicators...

...that I'm farther along the evolutionary
scale than the average human.

- No kidding?
- Yeah, wait, no, I'm not gonna so far...

...as to say that I represent
a distinct new stage in humankind.

You know, a Homo novus, if you will.

No, that's for anthropologists to decide.

But I am convinced
that the reason I cannot master...

...the plebeian task of driving
is because I'm not meant to.

Yes, you are.
You're meant to learn how to drive.

- Please learn how to drive.
- No, no.

I'm meant for greater things, like
unraveling the mysteries of the universe...

...not determining when it's safe to pass
a stopped school bus on a country road.

- It's never safe.
- Yeah, well, I know that now.

Fine. Assuming
that everything you say is true...

...how does the biologically superior
Homo novus get to work...

...tomorrow morning?

Homo novus doesn't know.

Well, hang in there.

Maybe you'll evolve into something
with wings.

SHELDON: Good morning, gentlemen.
- Hey.

Good morning.

Is there some new kind of Casual Friday
I don't know about?

No, he lives here now.

Really? Why?

Well, since he won't take the bus
and he's too evolved to drive...

...he decided to sleep in his office...

...and shower in the radiation lab
until I'm finished with my experiment.

But you finished your experiment
a week ago.

Yep.

[IN SPANISH]

[LOUD BANGING]

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

You saw nothing.

[English - US - SDH]

So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...

...my door is always open.

Again, I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.

Now we know what happens...

...when you accidentally spill peach
Snapple into a helium-neon laser.

The short answer is don't.

Now to tell you about
the Theoretical Physics Department...

...is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

- Dr. Cooper?
SHELDON: Forget it.

Excuse me.

- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
SHELDON: It's a waste of time.

I might as well explain thermodynamics
to a bunch of Labradoodles.

If you don't do this,
I won't take you to the comic-book store.

Hello.

Nice work with the laser, by the way.

Looking out at your fresh young faces...

...I remember when I too
was deciding my academic future...

...as a lowly graduate student.

Of course, I was 14...

...and had achieved more
than you could ever hope to...

...despite my 9:00 bedtime.

Now, there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...

...to succeed in theoretical physics.

It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

...how to make papier-mÃ¢chÃ© volcanoes
with baking-soda lava.

Oh, good God.

In short, anyone who told you
that you would someday be able...

...to make any significant contribution
to physics played a trick on you.

A cruel trick indeed.

Any questions?

Of course not.

I weep for the future of science.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of Batman is out.

Come, Leonard.

Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

I love this time of the year.

The leaves are turning.
There's a bracing chill in the air.

Plus, there's a whole new crop
of female grad students...

...about to put on just enough winter
weight to make them needy and vulnerable.

That's right, honey, have another calzone.
Daddy can wait.

Isn't there a policy
against dating graduate students?

No. If you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

Damn. There's always a catch.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

So, dumb-ass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

Because first-rate minds
call you "dumb-ass."

Oh, yeah? Well...

You're a mean person.

Excuse me, Dr. Cooper?

I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

- I think you're just brilliant.
- Well, that is the prevailing opinion.

God, now I'm gonna throw up.

Howard Wolowitz,
Department of Engineering...

...co-designer of the International Space
Station's liquid-waste-disposal system.

Ew.

Dr. Cooper, I've read everything
you've published.

I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...

...and was wondering how you determined
that three-dimensional string nets...

...provided a unified picture of fermions
and gauge bosons.

Amazing. An intelligent Labradoodle.

Woof.

The fact is,
I'm quite close to a breakthrough...

...in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

Oh, my God. That would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

It's what I do.

You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
liquid-waste-disposal system...

...is turning a few heads as well.

Again, ew.

You know, I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

- Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
- I don't drink coffee.

I do. I love me a cup of Joe.

It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

- I do eat dinner.
- Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.

I never eat in strange restaurants.
One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.

- Excuse me?
- Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.

Three tines is not a fork.
Three tines is a trident.

Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

- What if I brought food to your place?
- That would be acceptable.

On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

Mee Krob and chicken satay
with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

You got it. I already have your address.

What a nice girl.

Sheldon, do you have any idea
what just happened?

Yes. Apparently, I'm getting a free dinner.

Oh, yeah, no,
this thing's majorly out of order.

- See? I'm sorry.
- Okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.

- Where you going?
- Four-A.

- Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
- No, Dr. Cooper.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

We're having dinner.

Sheldon Cooper?

Tall, thin, looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

He is cute, isn't he?

PENNY:
Sheldon Cooper?

- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

Thanks. Where should I put this?

- The kitchen's fine.
- Okay.

- Hey. What are you doing?
- I need to see this.

Uh-huh.

The viewing area's right over there.

Sheldon, your girl... Date... Person...
Ramona's here.

- Oh, hello.
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

I got caught up reading the draft
of your latest paper.

Did you enjoy the footnote where
I illustrate mirror symmetry by likening it...

- ...to The Flash playing tennis with himself?
- So funny.

[LAUGHS]

The idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity...

...I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

I assumed we were going to be alone.

Oh. Yeah. No, we were just going.

To watch, right?

- No. Come on now. We're going out.
- Oh, come on. We'll be quiet.

Come on, let's go.

Okay, you two.

You just have a nice whatever this is.

Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none
of my business, but I just... I have to ask.

What's Sheldon's deal?

- What do you mean, "deal"?
- You know, like, what's his deal?

Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?

Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption that he has no deal.

- Oh, come on, everybody has a deal.
- Not Sheldon.

Over the years, we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

I'm an advocate of mitosis.

I'm sorry?

I believe, one day, Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food...

...and split into two Sheldons.

On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species.

He'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later...

...with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.

- Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?
- Well, what are you guys gonna do?

Uh...

My mom's making a brisket tonight.

- The one with the little onions?
- Yeah.

Yeah, I'm busy. So good night.

Her loss. Let's go.

Brisket party. B to the R to the I-S-K.

To the E to the T to the...

- Ooh...
- Don't.

- Hey. Aren't you having breakfast?
- Yes.

Are you experimenting
with nutritional suppositories again?

Not in these pants.

- So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
- Oh, great.

She's smart, insightful.

She has a very unique way of,
you know, revering me.

- Here's your spinach-mushroom omelet.
- Thank you.

- Did anyone touch it?
- Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

I was vigilant.

Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day...

...standing on cafeteria lines.

Time which would be better spent tackling
the great physics problems of our day.

You don't tackle the big issues, Ramona.
You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.

[LAUGH ING]

TouchÃ©.

- Morning.
- Oh, hey, Leslie.

So I see you're organizing your papers...

...for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumb-Assery.

There won't be any room until they get rid
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

Oh, good one.

I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles.

I'll let you keep your lunch money today.

Okay, Dr. Cooper
is on the verge of a breakthrough.

If you're going to stay,
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

Wait for me.

So have you worked out
the neutrino issue?

Well, to paraphrase Mozart,
all the subatomic particles are there.

- I just have to put them in the right order.
- You're so witty.

Aren't I?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hey, guys, this package came for...

- Dr. Cooper is working.
- Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

Oh! Tickles.

Sorry.

Holy crap on a cracker.

- Hey, Penny.
- Hi. You probably don't wanna go in there.

Why? What are they doing?

You know, the only way I could explain it
would be in a therapist's office with dolls.

Ooh, boy.

- Dr. Cooper's working.
- Yeah, I can see that.

Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's.
You coming?

Oh, yes, it's Halo night.
Let me just dry my tootsies.

- You're not going to Halo night.
- Yes, I am. It's Wednesday.

Wednesday's Halo night.

Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less...

...than the fervent and unconditional
dedication of our entire lives"?

- He did.
- And who was that great man?

Me.

- Sorry, Leonard.
- Seriously? You're not coming?

You heard her. How can I argue with me?

Okay. Well, once again,
you guys have a good...

...whatever this is.

Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you,
your friends are holding you back.

I prefer to think of it as
I'm pulling them forward.

Halo night?

A man with your intellectual gifts
doesn't waste an evening...

...playing video games.

He does on Wednesdays.

Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

He does want that.

Does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends?

- What do you think?
- Drat.

- Now, shall we get back to work?
- I suppose.

Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.

I guess I can wait for the DVD.

And then never, ever watch it.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Sheldon, honey, I've told you,
it's a small apartment.

- You only have to knock one...
- I don't have a lot of time.

Look, Ramona finally dozed off,
and I need you to help me get rid of her.

Get rid of her how?

I don't know, but, apparently,
I'm in some kind of relationship...

...and, well, you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

Excuse me?

I see man after man
leaving this apartment never to return.

Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.

RAMONA: Dr. Cooper?
- Hide me.

- Hide you?
- I formally request sanctuary.

Why aren't you working?

Um...

She distracted me.

I told you,
I don't have time for your nonsense.

I have important things to do.

- Oh, man.
- I know what's going on here.

Really?
Well, then will you explain it to me?

You're in love with Dr. Cooper.

Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

Don't try to deny it.

He's a remarkable man,
but you have to let him go.

Oh, gee. Okay.

I know it's hard, but he's a gift
to the whole world, and we can't be selfish.

Yeah, he's a gift, all right.

Sisters?

Sure, sisters. Heh, heh.

Okay.

Holy crap on a cracker.

[TAPPING ON WALL]

Sheldon?

- What are you doing?
SHELDON: It's Morse code.

- Why?
- So we can communicate through the wall.

We are communicating through the wall.

Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

- I don't know Morse code.
- Oh, it's very simple. This is A.

[SHELDON KNOCKING ON WALL]

This is B.

- This is C.
- I'm not going to learn Morse code...

...at 3:00 in the morning.

All right.

Don't come in here. Don't come in here.
Don't come in here. Don't...

Oh.

- What's going on?
- Shh. Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

- I know. When is she going home?
- Never. That's the problem.

- I need your help.
- What are you talking about?

I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

That only applies
if you need me to help you destroy...

...an artificial intelligence you created
that's taking over the earth.

Come on, don't nitpick.

- Good night.
- All right.

I'm invoking our Body Snatchers clause.

The Body Snatchers clause requires me
to help destroy someone we know...

...who's been replaced with an alien pod.

Yes. She's in the living room.
Go. I'll wait here.

- Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
- Now. Do it.

You need your sleep for your cognitive
processing to perform at optimum levels.

- Now, come on.
- Godzilla clause?

LEONARD:
Not unless she destroys Tokyo.

SHELDON:
Rats.

SHELDON:
I've got it!

I finally reconciled
the black hole information paradox...

...with my theory
of string-network condensates.

- It's unbelievable. It's paradigm-altering.
- And I could not have done it without you.

- I just offered a little encouragement.
- You did a lot more than that.

You helped me work out
the masses of the fermions...

...and you pumiced my hammertoe.

How can I ever repay you?

Well, would you consider naming it
the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

Who's Nowitzki?

- I'm Nowitzki.
- Oh, you want me to share credit?

Uh-huh.

Get out.

- Oh, hey. Hi.
RAMONA: Oh, bite me.

Sisters?

Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.
I'm Kathy O'Brian.

I just finished reading your paper...

...reconciling
the black hole information paradox...

...with your theory of string-network
condensates, and it took my breath away.

Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

Let's see. Today's Thursday.

Thursday nights
I eat pizza from Giacomo's.

- Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
- Great. I'll bring it to your place.

I have the address.

What a nice girl.

Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

Yes. I'm getting a free pizza.

I'm on a roll.

- More pad thai, please.
- Sheldon, you've already had four servings.

You might wanna
slow down a bit, buddy.

Just one more bite.

LEONARD:
Sheldon?

- Sheldon, are you okay?
- I'm just so fu... Full.

[YELPS]

That's it. No more Thai food.

[English - US - SDH]

Time. All right, Klingons, pencils down.

Okay, I have pokh.

ALL:
Got it.

[SPEAKING IN KLINGON]

ALL:
Yep.

Got it.

- I have chorrr.
ALL: Got it.

ALL: Yeah.
- And kreplach.

- Hold on a second, kreplach?
- Yeah.

That isn't Klingon.
It's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

Well, as it turns out,
it's also a Klingon word.

Really? Define it.

Kreplach, a hearty Klingon dumpling.

Judge's ruling?

[SPEAKS IN KLINGON]

Hey, guys. I need to use your TV.

- What's wrong with your TV?
- I don't know. Just died. I'm getting static.

Did you pay your cable bill?

Ugh. You sound
just like the cable company.

All right, so shh. Tyra Banks is about to
kick someone off America's Next Top Model.

- Excuse me, Penny, but we're...
- Don't tell her.

...playing Klingon Boggle.

[GROANS]

What do you mean, "Ohh?"
Like she didn't know we were nerds?

All right, if you must watch,
then mute it with closed captions, please.

Fine.

All right, Boggle warriors.

[SPEAKS IN KLINGON]

Look at those women.

They're gorgeous.

Oh, worf. Nice.

Too bad that's a proper noun.

Oh, look,
there's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

No wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

With her head in the lap of...

What a coincidence.
It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

Yeah, and they can all move in
with you and your mother.

The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

Is qochbe spelled with
a "qo" or a "ko?"

Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

Oh, that's AnaÃ¯s. None of the
other girls in the house like her.

House? What house?

- They all live in a house together.
- A house? Where?

I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.

Wait a minute.

You're telling me
that I'm within driving distance...

...of a house filled
with aspiring supermodels?

Yeah, I guess.

And they live together
and shower together...

...and have naked pillow fights?

- Hey, where are you going?
- To pay my cable bill.

All right, pencils down.

I have lokh, makh...

...and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?

[CHATTERING ON TV]

Did I miss anything?
Did they kick Giselle off?

Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot
was an embarrassment.

Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz
is sensitive to chlorine.

Lucky for her I like my fashion models
pruny and bug-eyed.

Sheldon, the food's here.

Oh, there's the house.

Freeze frame, freeze frame.

- What are you doing?
- Marking the positions and landmarks...

...so we can find the house
of the supermodels.

- Why?
- Isn't it obvious?

Every week they kick out
a beautiful girl...

...making her feel unwanted
and without self-esteem.

A.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

- Is my hamburger medium-well?
- Yes.

- Dill slices, not sweet?
- Yes.

- Individual relish packets? Onion rings?
- Yes.

- Extra breading? What did they say?
- I asked. No.

- Did you protest? Vociferously?
- Yes. No.

Well, then, what took you so long?

Just eat.

- Hey, guys. What'd I miss, what'd I miss?
- Giselle's hanging by a thread.

Oh, good, I hate her.

Then you're not invited to our wedding.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Oh, do we have to suffer...

...through this transparently manipulative,
pseudo-reality again?

ALL:
Yes.

You and I have a standing TV schedule...

...the result of extensive debate
and compromise.

Any alterations
except for breaking news...

...have to be pre-approved
at the weekly roommate meeting.

Put it on the agenda.

You have to make a motion.

I'll make a motion
but you're not gonna like it.

Fine. Mock parliamentary procedure.

At least put it on mute.

Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off.

It's totally gonna be Summer.

[SQUEALS]

- What?
- Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back.

- It's one onion ring.
- Just put it back before he comes.

Don't think that's where it was.

Okay, here he comes.
Deny, deny, deny, people. Wall of silence.

- Who touched my...?
- Penny. Penny did it.

Why would you do that?

I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal?

The big deal
is that nobody touches food on my plate.

All right. I didn't know. I'm sorry.

Well, I'm sorry,
but that is your second strike.

- What?
- You have two strikes.

Three strikes and you're out.

It's a sports metaphor.

- A sports metaphor?
- Yes, baseball.

All right, yeah, I'll play along.

- What was my first strike?
- March 18th.

You violated my rule
about forwarding e-mail humor.

I did?

The photo of the cat
who wants to "Has Cheezburger?"

Oh, come on, everybody loves Lolcats.

They're cute and they can't spell...

...because they're cats.

I trusted you with my e-mail address
and you betrayed that trust...

...by sending me Internet banality.
Strike one.

Touching my food, strike two.

Don't worry,
they only stay on your record for a year.

You can get them removed early
but you have to take his class.

- Oh, come on, I touched one onion ring.
- And then you put it back.

Compromising the integrity
of all the other onion rings.

Oh, honey, the buses don't go
where you live, do they?

Look, I wish I could be more lenient
with you.

But since you've become
a permanent member...

...I've to hold you to the same standards
as everybody else.

Congratulations,
you're officially one of us.

[CHANTS]
One of us, one of us.

Well, what a thrill.

- You're sitting in my spot.
- Oh, gee, you've gotta be kidding me.

- Leonard, she's in my spot.
- Yeah, yeah.

See, here's the thing...

...after you leave,
I still have to live with him.

I don't care. I'm taking a stand.

Metaphorically.

All right, that's it.

- Strike three.
- Oh, strike three.

I'm banished?

- What the hell kind of crap is that?
LEONARD: Listen.

- Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
- Yeah, you do that.

Just so I know,
would you be open to taking his class?

You can do it online.

So on our triangulation, we've narrowed
the location of the Top Model house...

...to three square miles
in the Hollywood Hills.

Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.

When we find it, wanna go with us?

- To do what?
- Party with the pretty girls, dude.

Are you insane?
You're not gonna party with them.

You're not even gonna get near
that place.

That's what they said to Neil Armstrong
about the moon.

No one said anything of the kind
to Neil Armstrong.

The entire nation dedicated a decade
of effort and treasure...

...to put a man on the moon.

My fellow Americans,
before this year is out...

...we will put a Wolowitz
on one of America's Top Models.

And a large number of people
will believe it never happened.

Okay, let me guess.

Quesadilla with soy cheese...

- ...for lactose-intolerant Leonard.
- Thank you.

Shrimp caesar salad with no almonds
for the highly allergic...

...kosher-only-on-the-High-Holidays
Howard.

And for our
suddenly-back-on-the-Hindu-wagon Raj...

...meat lover's pizza, no meat.

Coming right up.

Wait. Excuse me. You forgot
my barbecue bacon cheeseburger...

...barbecue sauce,
bacon and cheese on the side.

Oh, I didn't tell you?

You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

- Why?
- Well, you have three strikes.

One, coming in. Two, sitting down.

And three, I don't like your attitude.

You can't do that. Not only is it a violation
of California State Law...

...it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

- Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Look, here's the thing.

I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible.

And he agrees that he was unreasonable
and out of line.

- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

Oh, just apologize to him, okay?

What? I'm not gonna apologize
to that nutcase.

Come on, it's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

Don't you get it? You keep going along
with his insanity, you're encouraging him.

We're not encouraging.
It's more like knuckling under.

I like hanging out but I'm not gonna
apologize for something I didn't do.

Well, actually, technically you did do it.

That's strike one, Leonard.

Here you go. Quesadilla.

Salad.

Here's your pizza.

And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion
with my manager...

...barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue
sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

Thank you.

Go ahead. Eat it.

I dare you.

That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

- Are you sure?
- Look. On the roof.

AnaÃ¯s and Giselle are sunbathing.

European style.

You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

It was already targeted
to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

Okay, where is he?

Sheldon? I dropped him off
at the comic book store.

Here. Try and go online.

- Problem with the Wi-Fi?
- No, just try.

Greetings, hamburger-toucher.

You are probably wondering
why you cannot IM with your little friends...

...about how much you
heart various things.

Well, this recorded message
is alerting you...

...that I am putting an end to your
parasitic piggybacking upon our Wi-Fi.

If you want to remedy the situation...

...you can contact the phone company,
set up your own Wi-Fi and pay for it...

...or you may apologize to me.

- Well?
- I reiterate. Knuckle under.

Oh, no, no, no. It is on.

I'm gonna introduce your friend
to a world of hurt.

Oh, Penny,
you don't wanna get into it with Sheldon.

The guy's one lab accident away
from being a super villain.

I don't care. I was in junior rodeo. I can
hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

No need to neuter the nerd.
I can get you back online.

There, see?

Problem solved.

VoilÃ .

SHELDON:
Hello, puny insects.

As a consequence of your efforts
to circumvent my will...

...everyone is awarded
one additional strike.

Thanks a lot, Howard.

What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who has to take the class again.

Oh!

Hello.

Time to do your laundry, huh?

Saturday night.

Saturday is laundry night.

I know.

Every Saturday at 8:15.

Easy to anticipate.

SHELDON:
What are you implying?

I'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

And if something were to prevent you from
doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15...

...you might find it...

...unpleasant.

Knuckle under, my ass.

Oh, no.

Are all the machines taken?

What are you gonna do?

No problem.

I'll just do my laundry another night.

Another night?

Well, I guess you can try...

...but deep inside your heart you'll know
that laundry night is always Saturday night.

Woman, you are playing with forces
beyond your ken.

Yeah, well,
your Ken can kiss my Barbie.

Sheldon?

Sheldon? Sheldon?

Yes?

Where are my clothes?

- Your clothes?
- Yes. I left them in the washers.

I went to get them,
they were gone.

Really? Despite the sign that says:
"Do not leave laundry unattended"?

Sheldon, where are my clothes?

You know, I do recall
seeing some female undergarments.

Where was that? Oh, yes.

Earlier this evening...

...I happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye.

Do those look familiar?

How the hell did you get them up
on that telephone wire?

When you understand the laws of physics,
Penny, anything is possible.

And may I add:
Mua-ha-ha.

- Get them down.
- Apologize.

- Never.
- Then I suggest...

...you get a very long stick
and play panty piÃ±ata.

Look, wait, Sheldon.

This has gotten out of hand. Okay.

I've done some stupid things,
you've done some stupid things.

How about call it even,
move on with our lives?

I've done no stupid things.

- Look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.
- I am.

I'm willing to concede that you've
done some stupid things.

Hey, you guys are talking again. Good.

What happened?

Leonard,
remember when I said it was on?

Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

Oh, not junior rodeo.

What did you do?

I had no choice, Leonard.
She ruined laundry night.

Ooh!

SHELDON:
Mua-ha-ha.

Telephone wires can't electrocute you,
can they?

No. Look, this has to stop.

- Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
- All right.

I really didn't wanna do this...

...but here.

What this?

Sheldon's kryptonite.

Oh, my God.

He can never know
that I gave that to you.

Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but...

But this?

It will shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives.

[CHATTERING AND CHEERING
ON TV]

Pause it. That's it. Confirmed.

We now have the address
of the Top Model house.

God bless you,
Google Street View registered trademark.

Okay, for the record,
what you are doing is really creepy.

If it's "creepy" to use the Internet,
military satellites and robot aircraft...

...to find a house
full of gorgeous young models...

...so that I can drop in on them
unexpectedly, then fine, I'm "creepy."

[TELEPHONE RINGING]

Hello?

Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on a second, I'll get him.

Sheldon, it's for you.

- Who is it?
- Your mother.

Oh, good.

Hi, Mom. How are you?

But, Mom.

She keeps sitting in my spot.

And she touched my food.

Okay, yes, I took her clothes,
but she started it.

No, that's not fair.

Why should I have to apologize?

I really don't think this is the kind of thing
Jesus concerns himself with.

No, you're right. I don't really know
what Jesus thinks about.

All right!

Goodbye.

- Did you tell on me?
- Are you kidding me?

I already have two strikes.

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

I am very, very sorry
for what I have done.

Here's your laundry.

I rescind your strikes
and you are no longer banished.

Can I sit wherever I want?

No, no, no.

Never mind. Never mind.
That's not important.

Sheldon, this was big of you.

- Thank you. I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.

- Good night, Sheldon.
- Penny?

Yes?

Well played.

- Thank you.
- Just remember...

...with great power
comes great responsibility.

Understood.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Can I help you?

Yes, we're here to fix the cable.

I think we have satellite.

That's what I meant.

Oh. Okay. Come on in.

She's taller than all the women
in my family combined.

What do we do now?

Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.

[English - US - SDH]

Oh, look. Saturn 3 is on.

I don't wanna watch Saturn 3.
Deep Space Nine is better.

How is Deep Space Nine
better than Saturn 3?

Simple subtraction
will tell you it's six better.

Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.

[CHUCKLES]

In what sense is that a compromise?

Well, five is partway between three...
Never mind.

I'll tell you what.
How about we go Rock, Paper, Scissors?

Ooh, I don't think so.

Anecdotal evidence suggests
that in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors...

...players familiar with each other will tie
75 to 80 percent of the time...

...due to the limited number of outcomes.

I suggest
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

- What?
- It's very simple.

Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock...

...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

...Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

...lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

...Spock vaporizes rock,
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

Okay, I think I got it.

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

Oh...

Hello, boys.

Ahoy, matey.

Noticed the eye patch, did you?

It's all part of a technique
I've been studying for picking up women.

You employ a visual display...

...designed to make yourself
distinctive and memorable.

Oh, yes, like the male peacock
with brilliant plumage...

...or the rutting baboon
with engorged hindquarters.

Or in this case,
the bar mitzvah boy with pink eye.

Mock me if you will, but it works.

You show up in something distinctive...

...scope out your target
and toss out some negs.

- What are negs?
- A neg is a negative compliment...

...that throws a pretty woman
off her game, like:

"Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,
but on you they work."

I got a whole list of them.
Who wants to be my wingman?

You're not gonna need a wingman.
You're gonna need a paramedic.

Howard, your scooter's blocking my car.

Oh, did you get pink eye again?

Step one: she notices the eye patch.

May I say, Penny, not a lot of women
could look as hot as you do...

...with such greasy hair.

Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before
I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.

[DOOR SLAMS]

Ow.

[MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]

Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch
the Clone Wars TV series...

...until I've seen the Clone Wars movie.

I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me
in the order he intended.

Well, I wanna watch it now.

Then I believe we've arrived...

...at another quintessential Rock, Paper,
Scissors, Lizard, Spock moment.

Watch whatever you want.

I saw what you did there.

What'd I do?

[PHONE RINGS]

Hello? Hey, Howard.

What's wrong?

Uh, okay. Okay, we'll be right there.

- What happened?
- Howard's at the Mars-rover lab.

He says he's in trouble. DEFCON 5.

DEFCON 5? Well, there's no need to rush.

- What?
- DEFCON 5 means no danger.

DEFCON 1 is a crisis.

How can five not be worse than one?

Well, Star Trek V, worse than 1.

First of all, that's a comparison of quality,
not intensity.

Secondly, Star Trek I is orders of
magnitude worse than Star Trek V.

Are you joking?

Star Trek V is the standard
against which all badness is measured.

No, no, no.

Star Trek V has specific failures
in writing and direction...

...while Star Trek I fails across the board.

Art direction, costuming,
music, sound editing.

You know what? Can we just
forget I said "DEFCON" and go?

Star Trek V.

SHELDON: Will you at least stipulate
that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home...

...is inarguably the best?

I have three words for you:
Wrath of Khan.

- Thank God you're here.
- What's the emergency?

I got the Mars rover stuck in a ditch.

- Where?
- On a dusty highway...

...just outside Bakersfield.
Where do you think? On Mars.

[DOOR OPENS]

- Howard, is everything okay?
- Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

You brought a girl
to the Mars-rover control room?

Yeah, I picked her up in the bar.
She's a doctor.

One free barium enema...

...and my mother won't care
she's not Jewish.

Wait a minute, so the eye patch
and the insults worked?

No, there were three other guys
with eye patches. It was a fiasco.

What did work was, "How'd you like to visit
a secret government facility?"

So, what exactly do you want us to do?

You help me get the rover out, and you get
Stephanie out before somebody notices.

She doesn't exactly have clearance.

Really? They don't let strange women
from honky-tonks...

...play with $200 million
government projects on distant planets?

Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me.
Can we please move on?

Hey, Howard, it's getting late,
so do I get to drive this thing or what?

Yeah, no, I'm sorry,
but something's come up.

Kind of a Mars rover...

Mars-rover-can-Howard-come-over...

...kind of situation.

So my friend Leonard
is gonna take you home.

Oh, okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.

- Okay.
- I'll call you.

STEPHAN IE:
Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?

LEONARD:
No one's a scientist like Howard.

My mother is so gonna love her.

How nice. Maybe they can carpool
when they visit you in federal prison.

I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying?

- Just said Howard's a terrific guy.
- Yeah.

He's got a great sense of humor.

He loves his mother a lot.

Some people say too much.

- I really like that you're such a loyal friend.
- Yeah, I am loyal.

You know, if you look at the big picture.

Just, uh, out of curiosity,
did he ever have a shot with you?

Are you insane?
The guy was wearing an eye patch.

- So then why did you...?
- He said that I could drive a car on Mars.

- Got it.
- Yeah.

So can I see you again?

You're not done seeing me now.

LEONARD:
Hm.

Cool.

[KEYS CLICKING]

Anything?

Actually, I was just checking my e-mail.

But, uh, no, the rover is not responding.

I believe the appropriate metaphor here
involves a river of excrement...

...and a Native American water vessel
without any means of propulsion.

Hang on, there's gotta be other options.

You could try calling AAA.

But based on NASA's latest timetable,
they won't get there for 35 years.

Plus, I understand you have to be next to
the vehicle with your card when they arrive.

Oh, snap.

[CHUCKLES]

Snap what?

- Okay, I guess we have to turn to plan B.
- What's plan B?

Erase the hard drives, grab the tapes, wipe
our fingerprints off every surface and run.

Why wasn't that plan A?

ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: A NASA spokesman
states that due to the loss of data...

...they will most likely be unable
to determine the cause...

...of the Mars rover's malfunction.

Thank God for plan B.

Howard, didn't you say
you worked on the Mars rover?

No, you're mistaken.

Yeah, when we first met.

You said that if I went out with you
I could drive a car on Mars.

I don't know what you're talking about.

LEONARD:
Psst?

Will you all excuse me?

Leonard is signaling
that he'd like to talk to me in private.

No. Yeah, I remember specifically.

You started by asking if I was from Mars
because my ass was out of this world.

Well, that does sound like me, but no.

SHELDON:
Is there some problem?

Yeah, um, listen,
I have to kind of sneak out for a while.

- All right. Goodbye.
- No, wait.

If anyone asks you where I went,
you don't know.

- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you that.

Well, who would ask me?

I can't tell you that either.

You brought me here to inform me
you can't tell me where you're going.

And you can't tell me who might ask?

Yeah, I really didn't think this through.

- Leonard, a moment.
- What?

If someone...
And we don't know who this would be.

...does ask where you've gone,
what should I say?

I don't know.
Tell them I went to the office.

- Are you going to the office?
- No.

- Well, then how can I say it convincingly?
- Just say, "Leonard went to the office."

All right. Leonard went to the office.

What is...? No, not like that.

Just "Leonard went to the office."

Would have worked better if you
told me you were going to the office.

I'm going to the office.

See, why don't I believe you?

[MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]

- I'm going out for a while.
- Okay.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Doesn't anyone wanna know
where he's going?

Okay, where is he going?

Leonard is going to the office.

- So how was work today?
- Busy.

I removed an appendix, a gall bladder
and about a foot and a half of bowel.

I'm hoping that was three different guys.

[CHUCKLES]

No, just the one.

He didn't make it.

So how was your day?

You know, I'm a physicist,
so I thought about stuff.

- That's it?
- I wrote some of it down.

[LAUGHS]

- Are you done eating?
- Yeah.

Oh, good.

If I knew you were waiting,
I would have swallowed that lasagna whole.

[PHONE RINGS]

STEPHANIE [ON RECORDING]:
You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

Leave a message.

[PHONE BEEPS]

HOWARD:
Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard.

If you're free Friday, maybe we could
have something to eat at my place.

My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.

Let me know. It's Howard.

[CLICKS]

- I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
- Mm-hm.

Maybe we should think about
going to the bedroom.

That's a good idea, because there's a bed
there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.

[PHONE RINGS]

STEPHANIE: You've reached
Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message.

[PHONE BEEPS]

HOWARD:
Hey, it's me again.

Just wanna let you know the head count
for dinner Friday has gone up.

My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming
in from Palm Springs.

Oh, and if anybody should ask,
you're half Jewish on your mother's side.

Okay, call me. It's Howard.

[CLICKS]

Don't you think you should tell him
you're not interested?

You want me to stop
and call him back right now?

Dear God, no.

STEPHANIE [GIGGLING]:
Oh, Leonard.

[LEONARD LAUGHING]

[PHONE RINGS]

STEPHANIE: You've reached
Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message.

[PHONE BEEPS]

HOWARD:
Hey, it's me again. Howard.

Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale
are flying in to meet you...

...so that means we're gonna have to
move the dinner to a restaurant.

MRS. WOLOWITZ [SHOUTING OVER PHONE]:
Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden.

I have a coupon from the paper.

HOWARD:
We're not going to the Olive Garden, Ma.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Oh, Mr. Big-Shot with his Red Lobster.

HOWARD: I'll call you back
when we firm up the details.

It's Howard.

- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

- New shirts?
- Yeah, a couple.

PENNY: Nice.
- Thank you.

So who's the girl?

- I'm sorry?
- Well, last time you bought a new shirt...

...was when we were dating.

So, what we did was in fact dating?

Well, yeah, we did have a date.

Exactly. Thank you.

Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that
next time you see him.

So who is she?

- Oh, she's a doctor.
- Oh, nice.

A "doctor" doctor,
or a you kind of doctor?

"Doctor" doctor. Surgical resident.

Smart, pretty.

Let me ask you something.

If your friend thinks
he's dating someone...

...but he's not, because in fact,
you're dating her...

...does that make you a bad person?

- Well, that depends.
- On what?

Is that friend Wolowitz?

- Yeah.
- Screw him, you're fine.

- Are you sure?
- Well, have you slept with her yet?

You dog.

Good for you.

- Does that change things?
- No.

- So why'd you ask?
- I'm nosy. See you.

MRS. WOLOWITZ [SHOUTING]:
Howard, get the door!

HOWARD [SHOUTING]: Really? Is that
what you do when someone knocks?

Thank you, I had no idea!

[IN NORMAL TONE] Hey, buddy.
What brings you to my little slice of hell?

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Who is it?
- It's Leonard!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You're gonna have to play outside!

I'm not dressed to receive!

No one cares, Ma!

So, what's up?

Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

Momentito.

Hello?

Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back.
I was worried.

Oh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

No, I understand.
Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely.

Thanks for calling.

Yeah, you have a nice day too.

You are dead to me.

Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

Okay, one of us is going to have to stop
putting up Spock.

How do we decide that?

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

[ALL GRUNT]

- Oh, hey, guys.
SHELDON & RAJESH: Hey.

Hi, Howard.

- Howard?
- Sheldon.

Howard is employing
a schoolyard paradigm...

...in which you are
for all intents and purposes deceased.

He intends to act on this
by not speaking to you...

...feigning an inability to hear you
when you speak...

...and otherwise refusing to acknowledge
your existence.

That's ridiculous.
Why are you cooperating with him?

I don't make the rules, Leonard.

Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this.

These things just happen.
Usually not to me, but they do happen.

Did someone just feel a cold breeze?

I believe this is an extension
of the death metaphor.

The cold breeze
is a so-called ectoplasmic issue...

...of a disembodied soul passing by.

You know, screw it.
I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Oh, hi, Steph.
- Hey.

- Come on in.
- Oh, is this a bad time?

Yeah, but I don't see a better one
on the horizon, so...

Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead-To-Me.

Hello, Howard.

- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry, you violated...

...the terms of your metaphor
by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.

He just won't listen to me.

Okay, well, I guess
it'll just be the three of us then.

- Yeah. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.
STEPHANIE: Yeah.

Lisa?

Yeah, my roommate.
She just went through a bad breakup.

I thought she might like to meet
somebody fun like you.

Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive.
It's a miracle.

So anyway, Lisa,
I just wanted to tell you again...

...how much I enjoyed the other night,
and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

But again,
if you could let me know about Friday...

...my mother needs a head count
so she can know how big a brisket to get.

Howard. Look at this.

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

Anyway, call me. It's Howard.

ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: It's unclear how
the Mars rover got into the crevice...

...but one thing's certain:

The data which it has sent back
contain the first clear indications...

...that there may have been life on Mars.

It's a scientific discovery...

...that has staggering implications
for all mankind.

Unfortunately,
we'll never know who's responsible.

Son of a bitch.

[English - US - SDH]

- Penny, hello.
- Hey, Sheldon.

What is shaking?

I'm sorry?

It's colloquial. A conversation opener.

So do you find the weather satisfying?

Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

PENNY: What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

I'm striking up a casual conversation
with you.

What's up?

Please don't do that.

But I'm given to understand that when
you have something awkward to discuss...

...it's more palatable
to preface it with banal chitchat.

So this wasn't the awkward part?

No.

Oh. All right.

What's up?

SHELDON:
Oh, good, I used that right.

Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship...

...which includes a sexual component.

- Okay, feeling the awkward now.
- Wait.

Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

And she's a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Fremont Memorial.

- Yeah, Leonard told me.
- Good.

What he may have left out
is how important this relationship is to me.

- To you?
- Yes.

See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with...

...she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.

Well, what about me?

The statement stands for itself.

Well, aren't you sweet?

Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her...

...it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

PENNY:
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

You say that now,
but consider the following scenario.

You're sitting in your apartment.
It's late. You're alone.

Your hypothalamus is swimming in
a soup of estrogen and progesterone...

...and, suddenly, even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate.

Or a hookup,
as it's referred to by today's urban youth.

- Really?
- Yes.

Now, should that happen, I would ask you
to find some way to suppress your libido.

I could think about you.

Fine. Whatever works.

Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.

Peace out.

SHELDON:
Mm.

Well, this is very pleasant.

I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

And you said there would never
be enough pasta for the three of us.

I stand corrected.

You know,
Italian housewives have a rule of thumb:

A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter...

...is sufficient for each person,
as it doubles in volume when cooked.

That's very interesting.

- Thank you.
- She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.

Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems
to be dropping the conversational ball...

...I guess I'll just have to pick it up.
Ahem.

Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

- No.
- Good.

- What's your favorite fruit?
- It, uh...

Strawberries.

Mm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

Where did you do
your medical internship?

Uh, Lawrence Memorial
in Galveston, Texas.

Really? That's where I was born.

- You're kidding.
SHELDON: No.

I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital. It...

When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.

- What? What happened?
- Radiation burns.

A little mishap
while I was building my own CAT scanner.

I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

I was briefly able to see the inside
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball...

...before he caught fire.

It led to an interesting expression
in our house:

Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner.

Uh, Sheldon.

Excuse me.

When I come back, just for fun,
the subject will be alternative history.

Specifically, how would the Civil War
have gone differently...

...if Lincoln had been
a robot sent from the future?

Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?

I do. Do you?

Because, frankly, you've been
in a foul mood since I sat down.

Okay, here's my question:

Why did you sit down?

To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship...

...and history suggests you will...

...then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed.

What landing party?

You're Kirk. I'm Spock.
Wolowitz is Scotty.

Koothrappali is the guy
who always gets killed.

And now we've got McCoy.

So we're all standing around
looking at the post-op X-ray...

...and there it is, clear as day,
right in the guy's chest cavity:

One of my earrings.

Oh, my God, what did you do?

Ha, ha. What do you think I did?

I discreetly slipped off the other earring...

...put it in my pocket,
and then got the hell out of there.

[LAUGHS]

- I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
- Oh!

- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hi, Stephanie.

I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion
left the most indecipherable invitation.

What invitation?

"We're going to the movies."

What movie? What theater? What time?

If you were trying to make it impossible to
locate you, you couldn't have done better.

Oh, clearly, I could have.

It took 20 minutes to go through...

...the browser history on your computer
to see what movie times you looked up.

Wait here, I'll find us seats.

- Oh, no. We have seats.
- Not the right seats.

Ha!

Ha!

Ha!

What is he doing?

He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.

Ha!

- Uh, does he always do this?
- Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.

SHELDON:
Ho!

Ho!

- I am really sorry about this.
- No...

...it's fine, you know. He's sweet.

[SHELDON HUMS TONE]

[HUMS TONE]

My apologies.
You've been sitting in it all along.

- Leonard, you wanna slide over one?
- No. Just sit here.

[THX'S "DEEP NOTE"
PLAYING ON SCREEN]

Oh, yeah. This is it.

Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
What, Sheldon?

Tell me what you see here.

The blunt instrument
that will be the focus of my murder trial?

This is Stephanie's Facebook page.

Now, where it should say
"in a relationship," what does it say?

- "Stephanie Barnett is single."
- Yeah, furthermore...

...earlier this evening, she threw
a digital sheep at some guy named Mike.

Who's Mike? Why does he
get a digital sheep and not you?

It's just her Facebook page, and we've
only been going out a couple of weeks.

You don't see it, do you?
We're losing her.

Okay, I'm gonna make this very simple
for you.

You are not in this relationship.

I am.

Ergo, you have no say...

...in anything that happens
between me and Stephanie.

I'm afraid I can't allow that.

Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104,
Section A...

...you are deemed unfit,
and I hereby relieve you of your command.

General Order 104, Section A
does not apply in this situation.

- Give me one good reason why not.
- Because this is not Star Trek.

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

What?

This is banana bread.

This is a door knob.

It's my understanding
that an unsolicited gift of food...

...can be a precursor to an impromptu
invitation to come in and chat.

Sheldon, would you like to come in?

I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

[SHELDON GASPS]

Were you robbed?

No.

How can you be sure?

Sheldon, what do you want?

I'm certain this will come
as no surprise to you.

- Leonard is failing in another relationship.
- He's having problems with Stephanie?

She's sending virtual livestock
to random men on the Internet.

If I have any hope
of keeping them together, I need data.

Specifically, I need to know exactly
what Leonard did that caused you...

...to pop an emotional cap
in his buttocks.

- What?
- Again, urban slang.

In which I believe
I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

So, what is the down and the low?

And don't worry,
this is all entirely confidential...

...so you feel free to include any
and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

Heh. We never got to the bedroom.

Because?

[SCOFFS]

Okay. All right. You know what?
I'll tell you what happened.

Ah. We were young.

We were very much in love,
but we could only communicate...

...through a time-traveling mailbox
at my lake house.

It's not enough that you made me watch
that movie, but now you mock me with it?

Gentlemen, I have a question
about dating and relationships.

You told me
you were gonna have the talk with him.

I've been waiting for someone
to have the talk with me.

More to the point, it's about finding a way
to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.

- Oh, I don't think you can.
- Why not?

Look at Leonard's record.
Twenty-seven days with Joyce Kim.

During which she defected
to North Korea.

Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.

For which she awarded him the nickname
Speed-of-Light Leonard.

And a three-hour dinner with Penny.

Which would've been two and a half if they
ordered the soufflÃ© when they sat down.

Based on the geometric progression...

...his relationship with Stephanie
should have ended after 20 minutes.

Yes, I'm aware of the math.

Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

The issue remains.

How do we circumvent
his inevitable rejection?

Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal
to Stephanie...

...your best bet would be
to kill all the other men on the planet.

I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.
That body spray...

...where the women undress
when they smell it?

That doesn't work at all.

No matter how much you put on.

So that's all you've got? Apocalyptic
genocide and "Go easy on the cologne"?

- Yes.
- Yeah.

Penny.

Penny.

What?

Penny.

Zucchini bread.

Oh, thank you.

- May I come in?
- No.

I see. Apparently, my earlier inquiry...

...regarding you and Leonard
crossed some sort of line.

I apologize.

Oh, thank you.

So have you and I returned
to a social equilibrium?

- Yes.
- Great.

- New topic.
- Mm.

Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

- What?
- I've been doing some research online...

...and, apparently, female primates...
You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

...they find their mate more desirable
when he's courted by another female.

Now, this effect is intensified
when the rival female...

...is secreting the pheromones
associated with ovulation.

Which brings me back to my question.
Where are you in...?

Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

All I'm saying is,
if they can cure yellow fever and malaria...

...why can't they do something
about lactose intolerance?

Leonard, you're gonna have to let this go.

You had a little cheese dip, you farted.
I thought it was cute.

Oh, hi, Stephanie.

Hi.

- Want some more wine?
- Yeah.

I mean,
I assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

[SHELDON GROANS]

[GRUNTS]

[GRUNTS]

What are you doing?

I have a craving for white asparagus that,
apparently, is destined to go unsatisfied.

[GRUNTS]

[GRUNTS]

- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

[GRUNTS]

- What is wrong with you?
- I'm helping you with Stephanie.

By making constipated moose sounds?

When I fail to open this and you succeed,
it will establish you as the alpha male.

You see, when a female witnesses
an exhibition of physical domination...

...she produces the hormone oxytocin.

If the two of you engage in intercourse,
this will create the biochemical reaction...

...which laypeople naively interpret
as falling in love.

Huh.

Would it work
if I just punched you in the face?

Yes, actually, it would,
but let's see how the lid goes.

I'm not strong enough, Leonard.
You'll have to do it.

- God's sakes.
- Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

[GRUNTING]

- Do you want some help with that?
- No, no, no.

- I got it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

He's got it, and that's not surprising.

This is something I long ago came
to peace with in my role as the beta male.

Open it.

Ow!

- Ow, ow!
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

Uh, no, I'm not... I'm bleeding.

Like a gladiator.

- Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.
- Stitches?

- Mm-hm.
- With a needle?

Well, yeah. I mean, just a few.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, hang on a sec.

[VOMITING]

FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.

What a beautiful job Stephanie did.

I might have gone
with a mattress suture instead...

...but you can't argue with her results.

It's a shame it won't scar.

The war wound
is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

I can't remember a time
when you weren't talking.

Just for the record, my efforts to establish
you as the alpha male were not aided...

- ...by you bursting into tears.
- I did not burst into tears.

- My eyes just got a little watery.
- Watery?

She stuck a needle into my hand.

Hey, how's my big crybaby?

I didn't cry.

Okay, I'm just teasing you.

But, yeah, you did.

It's all good. What do you say
we get you home, put you to bed?

Oh. Are you still gonna spend the night?

Uh, no. I think that you
probably need to rest.

She's right. As long as you're vomiting,
coitus is contraindicated.

Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.

Okay, I'm gonna go
get your discharge papers.

[SHELDON CLICKS TONGUE]

What?

You seem like
a perfectly pleasant person.

I can't understand why women
have such a hard time loving you.

Can you open this for me?

- Can I see your stitches?
- Sure.

[RETCHING]

Answering the question once and for all
why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.

Leonard, congratulations.

- What for?
- Your Facebook status update.

"Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship."

What? No. No, that's not right.

Oh, man, did you switch your status
before she did?

Speaking as an expert,
way to look needy.

Seriously?
You went first after only two weeks?

That's bold.

It's not bold, it's a mistake.

I didn't change my status.

Well, then who did?

I had no choice. He cried in front of her.

You hacked my Facebook account?

Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use
the same password for everything, Kal-El.

Are you insane?
Now she's gonna think I'm desperate.

You've destroyed this relationship.

And you wanna know
the worst part?

You don't understand
what you did wrong...

...because you can't conceive of something
that you are not an expert in.

- In which I am not an expert.
- Don't even...

Don't wanna hear another word
out of you.

Ooh.

What's wrong, Lassie?
Timmy fall down the well?

Oh, wow.

She just updated her Facebook status.

"Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship
with Leonard Hofstadter."

Really?

Oh, look at that.

I have a girlfriend. Ha, ha.

If I am permitted to speak again...

...Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.

[English - US - SDH]

- I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
- Ugh.

You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

Me too.

Is it a high-frequency whistle?

No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.

Then it must be a tumor.

I seriously doubt it.

Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

Even in church.

Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.

Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

- I'll be right in.
- Okay.

It's not enough she mocks me...

...but that isn't even the correct procedure
for a cootie shot.

Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?

How is it imaginary that
I keep hearing an octave above middle C?

[HUMS]

Is that imaginary?

[HUMS]

I don't think so.

[HUMS]

- Good night.
- Leonard, there's one more thing.

Article One, Section Three
of our roommate agreement.

- I'm calling an emergency meeting.
- No, you're not.

Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
Second? None heard, the motion fails.

I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

- Thank you.
- And that being said...

...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...

...which has been activated
now that you're living together.

- We're not living together.
- I beg to disagree. Ahem.

"A girlfriend shall be deemed, quote,
living with, unquote, Leonard...

...when she has stayed over,
A, 10 consecutive nights...

...or B, more than nine nights
in a three-week period, or C...

...all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights."

- That's absurd.
- No.

You initialed it. See? "L.H., L.H., L.H."

Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.

I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

Hm. Yes, you did.

Now to review, the following provisions
are hereby activated.

In the refrigerator, as opposed to two
separate shelves and one communal shelf...

...the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal.

Next, apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week...

...to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

The bathroom schedule.
I'm given to understand...

...women have different needs,
so we'll have to discuss that.

- I'm going to bed.
- But, yeah, but...

At least take this with you.

Look, and have Stephanie
initial here, here, here, here...

...and here.

This states that she does not now...

...nor does she intend to play a percussive
or brass instrument.

[SIGHS]

[HUMMING]

[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Sure sounds like a tumor...

...pressing on the auditory nerve.

- No, absolutely not.
- It's not a big deal.

We have latex gloves.

I don't care what the symptoms are.

My girlfriend is not gonna give you
a prostate exam.

- Hi, Sheldon.
- Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?

Oh, good God.

Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

I heard you ask it over and over.

How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?

- He did very nicely.
- But see? She's not offended.

And now you finally have an answer.

- Out of coffee. Need coffee.
- Uh...

- Hello.
- Hi. Stephanie, right?

Mm-hm. And...? And you are?

I'm Penny. I live across the hall.

- Heard a lot about you.
- Really?

- Mm-hm. Ha, ha.
- I haven't heard a thing about you.

Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall...

...and comes into your apartment
in the morning in her underwear?

Um. Uh...

She's heard about you
because we're, you know, involved...

...and you haven't heard about her
because...

I never slept with her, I swear.

In Leonard's defense,
it wasn't for lack of trying.

- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Leonard.

Look, I'm just saying, um...

...Penny is one of our many neighbors,
you know.

And in our building,
neighbors come and go.

Well, it's very casual. No dress code or...

Some mornings, I'll mosey down
to the third floor in my pajamas...

...and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

Really? I've never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

She doesn't like you.

- Well, you have a gall bladder to remove.
- Yeah.

And I have to get in the shower
and Penny has clothes to put on, so...

- Well, it was very nice meeting you.
- Nice to finally meet you too.

- I'll see you tonight? Bye.
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

What could I possibly have done to offend
Mrs. Vartabedian?

So that's Stephanie, huh?

Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

- You know, she seems very nice.
- Oh, she is. She's terrific.

And she's proving to be
a valuable roommate.

- Roommate? You guys are living together?
- Like hippies.

We're not living together.

Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

We're not living together.

- Are you sure?
- How could I not be sure?

Well, let's find out.

Don't you think if a woman was living
with me, I'd be the first one to know?

Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one
to know about it.

Hmm.

Cute dresses.

I bet this looks great on you.

We're not living together.

Okay. Hmm.

Scented candles, fuzzy slippers. Ooh.

Floral bed sheets.

We're not living together.

Okay, moving on.

Uh, who are these guys at Disney World?

Uh...

The big dog is Goofy.

And the older couple with the mouse ears,
I have no idea.

We're not living together.

You're gonna go down swinging, huh?

All right. Well, we got your body lotion,
your In Style magazine, your jewelry box.

We're not... Where's my Bat-Signal?

- You have a Bat-Signal?
- I did.

It was right here.

She must have...

Oh, my God, we're living together.

Really? What was your first clue?

New pants?

Yeah. Stephanie got them for me.

Nice. Cotton?

Actually, I think
it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

The girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?
Sounds serious.

It is, actually.
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought...

...and I decided it was time
for us to live together.

Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner...

...eating the same deviled egg,
over and over again.

At least I have an egg.
What do you have?

A veritable smorgasbord
of potential sexual partners.

See the blond over there?

I can hit on her and you can't.

So go hit on her.

She's not my type.

Too bad.
She was checking you out before.

- She was?
- Of course not. Look at her.

You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

Stephanie and I are very happy
living together.

I will give either of you $20 right now
to trade pants with me.

- Sheldon? What are you doing here?
- Hang on.

130/80. That's a little high.

We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

- Thank you.
- Didn't teach you that in medical school?

- I'm kind of busy here.
- I understand.

All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...

...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?

Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

Go home, Sheldon.

Can I at least have the upper GI?

I already drank the barium.

Oh, hey.

Oh, good.
Do you have any fabric softener?

Yeah, sure.

What, are you washing a crocodile?

No. The pants that Stephanie got me.

Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these.
They'll be ruined.

- You sure?
- Absolutely.

Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

- Are you guys having problems?
- No. Everything's fine.

- Really?
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

Okay, maybe this whole
living together happened...

...kind of suddenly,
but it's fine, it's great.

Okay, Leonard, if you're uncomfortable
with the way things are going...

...you're allowed to say something.

Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

Believe me, your feelings
are just as important as hers.

No, that doesn't sound right either.

Tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace you both are comfortable with.

Yeah, I could say something
like that to her.

I'll go do that.

- Thank you.
- Sure.

You have a really good grasp on this.

Maybe you could talk to her?

You're kidding, right?

No, but that's okay.

I'll go talk to her.

Wanna come with?

Go.

Wow.

Oh, no.

What?

You were right.
Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

- I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
- I knew it.

What do I do?

You're gonna need to stop talking,
immediately.

- For how long should...?
- Eh, eh, eh!

Immediately.

- Hey.
- Oh, hi, honey.

Sheldon.

What's going on?

I just performed a Sheldon-ectomy.

Careful. If you don't get it all,
it'll only come back worse.

[LAUGHS]

- Gotcha.
- Listen, we need to talk.

Uh-oh.

Do we need to talk,
or do we need to talk.

I don't know what that means.

Okay, why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

Okay. Um...

Well, look, it's just that...

...things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

- And?
- It's just a little scary.

Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

Sure.

When is scary not good?

- But... Okay. Um, I have feelings, right?
- Uh-huh.

Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express
those feelings, right?

Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

Okay, well, I ju... I think it's important
to remember that we move...

...at a pace that is our speed and...

Oh, shoot, I had it.

Okay, how about this?
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

What's that?

Really? Right now?

- Why not?
- I just ate.

Aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

I think that's for swimming.

- Ah. Okay.
- Okay.

- Hope I don't get cramps.
- Yeah.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
- Thank you.

- Your pants are ruined.
- Good.

So how did the talk with Stephanie go?

Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

Not specifically.
But, um, I did tell her that I had feelings.

Good. Good.

And then what?

And then the subject
got changed somehow.

You had sex, didn't you?

Um...

Little bit.

- What?
- Nothing.

Okay, well, it sounds like
things are gonna work out.

Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

Everything's gonna work out,
one way or another.

God, come on, Leonard.

You are entitled to try and make things
go the way you want them to.

- Really?
- Yes.

You don't always have to go along
with what the woman wants.

Huh.

- What?
- Nothing. Just rethinking my whole life.

Okay, here's the thing.

I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.

Well, that's a chance you have to take.

I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

Very comforting.

Okay, so, what do I say to her?

I don't know.
What have women said to you...

...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?

I really like you,
but I wanna see how things go with Mark?

Yeah, that'll slow it down.

[BOTH PANTING]

I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying?

Oh.

Right, yeah. Um...

So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

- I really like you...
- Oh, God, here comes the speech.

What speech?

I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...

...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.

And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.

And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...

...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...

...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...

...even though I'm dying inside.

No.

No, no. Uh,
I wasn't gonna say any of that.

I was just gonna say...

- ...I really like you.
- Oh!

Oh, good, because I really like you too.

Terrific.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hey.

Nice sweater.

Yeah. Stephanie got it for me.
It's kind of fun.

It's got a big bird on it, dude.

Yeah, yeah. That's the fun part.

We're also getting new curtains for my
bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet.

And I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.

But every time I talk to her about
moving out, she cries and we have sex.

You're lucky.
With me, it's usually the other way around.

You know, if you can't talk to her,
why don't you just text her?

- Isn't that kind of cowardly?
- Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

That's true. But, on the other hand,
you are wearing a bird sweater.

Sold.

"I think it would be better
for our relationship...

...if you moved back to your place."

There.

- It's done.
- Good for you.

Yeah, good for me.

I'll never have sex again.

[PHONE BUZZING]

Oh, I was wrong. See you.

COMPUTER:
Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

Sheldon?

I have an inflamed larynx.

Okay.

We are out of herbal tea.
Do you have any?

Okay. Let me check.

Some heinie would be nice too.

Heinie?

Honey.

[English - US - SDH]

Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

And it is well-established...

...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

- Like what?
- I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

...when the planet Krypton exploded.

Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.

The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

Raj, please, let's stay serious here.

Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.

Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"

Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...

...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

Booyah.

Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

...before he left the bottle.

Kandorian dry-cl...? I give up. You can't have
a rational argument with this man.

Hey, isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

No, not all at once.

- Then how?
- Leonard.

Now Raj.

Now Sheldon.

- I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
- No.

- That's David Underhill. So what?
- So what?

His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided the first evidence...

...for the existence
of galactic dark matter.

I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

It is a big whoop. Made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

- Did not.
- Did too.

Okay, maybe some of it. But...

The guy was just in the right place
at the right time...

...with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

He got lucky.

In more ways than one.

He's a very handsome man.

Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way...

...I'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.

Oh, yeah.
Like you have a shot with Zac Efron.

Excuse me. Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

- Uh, yeah.
- I'm David Underhill.

Uh, yeah. Heh, heh.

Dr. Gablehauser said
if I wanted to set up something in the lab...

...that you'd be able to give me a hand?

- You wanna work with me?
- If you have time, yeah.

Wow. Yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem.

Um, here's my home number,
here's my cell, here's my office...

...here's my parents' number
up in New Jersey.

- They know how to reach me.
DAVID: Okay.

Congratulations on the MacArthur grant,
by the way. Big fan.

Thanks. I'll call you.

Okay.

Bye-bye.

What are you looking at?
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike...

...if he has hopes of catching up
with Sheldon...

...who is dominating in the ninth frame
with a career-best 68.

LEONARD:
Hey, guys.

That doesn't count. Do-over, do-over.

There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

There are always do-overs
when my people play sports.

Where were you that's more important
than Wii bowling night?

- Actually, I...
- It's a rhetorical question.

There is nothing more important
than Wii bowling night.

Come on, it's just a video game
and we suck at it.

[SHELDON GASPS]

Nice motivational speech
from the team captain.

- Where were you?
- I was working with Dave Underhill.

Ooh, "Dave."
Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

Actually, he is pretty cool.
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist...

...but it turns out
he's a black-diamond skier...

...he collects vintage motorcycles,
he plays in a rock band.

- So? We're in a rock band.
- No.

We play "Rock Band" on our Xbox.

Nice motivational speech
from our lead guitarist.

He's funny too.

He does this hysterical impersonation
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

[AS STEPHEN HAWKING]
What are you wearing?

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
That's not... He does it better.

He said he was gonna take me to the gym
so I'm gonna go practice my sit-ups.

Wow. Humongous man crush, dude.

Yup, it's officially a bromance.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hey, Sheldon. Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

Saturnalia?

Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...

...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...

...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

This custom was appropriated
by northern Europeans...

...and, eventually, it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

And that, Charlie Brown,
is what boredom is all about.

Okay, well, thank you for that.
I got you and Leonard silly neighbor gifts...

- ...so I'll just put them under my tree.
- Wait.

- You bought me a present?
- Uh-huh.

Why would you do such a thing?

- I don't know. Because it's Christmas?
- Oh, Penny.

I know you think you're being generous...

...but the foundation of gift-giving
is reciprocity.

You haven't given me a gift,
you've given me an obligation.

Don't feel bad, Penny.
It's a classic rookie mistake.

My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,
he yelled at me for eight nights.

It's okay.
You don't have to get me anything.

Of course I do. The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go and purchase...

...a gift of commensurate value and
representing the same level of friendship...

...as that represented by the gift
you've given me.

It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket
this time of year.

Okay, forget it,
I'm not giving you a present.

No, it's too late. I see it.
That elf sticker says "To Sheldon."

The die has been cast.
The moving finger has writ.

Hannibal has crossed the Alps.

I know. It's funny
when it's not happening to us.

- Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
- No, no. I brought this on myself...

...by being such an endearing
and important part of your life.

I'm going to need a ride to the mall.

It's happening to us.

LEONARD:
Ow. Ow.

DAVID: Are you gonna make it?
- Yeah, I guess.

Thanks for letting me try out
your motorcycle.

- No problem.
- I had no idea it was so heavy.

Thing just fell right over on me,
didn't it? Heh.

Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

- Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

It's just a little motorcycle accident.

Oh, my God. How fast were you going?

I don't know. It was all such a blur.

[CHUCKLES]

Good one.
He couldn't even get it started.

- Hi. Dave.
- Hi. Penny. So it's your motorcycle?

- Uh-huh.
- Oh. Is it okay?

Lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.

- Mind giving me a hand with Speed Racer?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

So, um, Dave,
how do you know Leonard?

- I'm a physicist.
- Ha, ha. No, you're not.

DAVID:
Why is that so surprising?

PENNY: Well, it's just that the physicists
I know are indoors-y and pale.

LEONARD:
I'm not indoors-y.

I just wear the appropriate sun block
because I don't take melanoma lightly.

So are you and Leonard working
on an experiment together?

- Yeah, we are.
- We're examining the radiation levels...

...of photomultiplier tubes
for a new dark-matter detector.

Sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking.

You know, I love science.

- Since when?
- Since always.

Call me a geek, but I am just nuts
for the whole subatomic-particle thing.

DAVID: The last thing
I would ever call you is a geek.

Oh, well, that's what I am.
Queen of the nerds.

Hey, if you'd like, I could show you
the lab we're working in.

We've got some cool toys, you know.
Lasers and stuff.

You know, I have always wanted to see
a big science lab.

- Since when?
- Since always.

Leonard, are you okay here?

- Yeah, I guess.
- How about we go see it now?

Afterwards, we take the bike up the coast,
we grab a bite to eat?

Um, yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.
Let me just get my jacket.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Boy, she'll do, huh?

Yeah, if you like that type.

So you and her...?

- No, just neighbors.
- Really?

I don't know how you live next door to that
without doing something about it.

Actually...

...science is my lady.

- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

- See you tomorrow, Leonard.
- See you.

Bye, Penny. Have fun.

SHELDON:
Yes?

Did you forget your key?

Well, I don't see anything in here
a woman would want.

You're kidding.
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

That's the estrogen hat trick.

What it is is a cacophonous assault of
eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

It's as if my head were trapped
in the pajamas of a sultan.

Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

I told you before, bears are terrifying.

Come on, bath stuff. It's perfect.

You got a scented candle,
a cleansing buff.

Spearmint-and-green-tea-scented bath oil
promotes relaxation.

That presupposes Penny is tense.

She knows you. She's tense.
We all are. Buy a basket.

- Excuse me, we're ready.
- No, we're not.

Let's say for a moment that
I accept the bath-item-gift hypothesis.

I now lay the following conundrum
at your feet. Which size?

This one. Let's go.

- You put no thought into that.
- I'm sorry. Ah...

This one. Let's go.

I have insufficient data to proceed.

- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

If I were to give you this gift basket...

...based on that action alone
and no other data...

...infer and describe the hypothetical
relationship that exists between us.

Excuse me?

Here.

Now are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers?

Are you my grandmother?

I don't understand
what you're talking about...

...and you're making me
a little uncomfortable.

See? Sounds just like you and Penny.
We'll take it.

Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny.
What a surprise.

Hey, Leonard. Dave was showing me
around the university.

You know, this place is unbelievable.

Yeah, I know. I've been offering
to show you around for a year and a half.

You always said you had yoga.

- I never said that.
- Maybe I heard you wrong.

A lot of words sound like "yoga."

This is an amazing woman, Leonard.
She has a curious and agile mind.

Not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

Shut up.

Yes, please, shut up.

So, um, Dave, don't you think
you and I should get back to the lab?

You know, that dark matter
isn't gonna detect itself.

I was thinking about taking the afternoon
off so I could experiment with Penny.

- Really? We're gonna do an experiment?
DAVID: Uh-huh.

We're gonna explore the effects of tequila
shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

That's not an experiment.
You saw what happened last night.

DAVID: You ready to go?
- Yeah.

- Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
- Yeah, why not?

You can't do any worse than Leonard.

- Oh, my God.
- No, that's good. That's funny.

By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

Mm. Great news, Leonard.
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

Yippee.

You see, the danger was that
I might under-or over-reciprocate...

...but I have devised a foolproof plan.

I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.

Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...

...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

...and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

Brilliant.

It is, isn't it?

Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

The smell makes me nauseated.

- Do whatever you want.
- Thank you. That's very gracious.

Gentlemen?

HOWARD: Why couldn't you have
just done what Leonard did...

...and get Penny a new boyfriend?

My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Okay, I have just one question for you.

While I am perfectly happy
with the way things are...

...you said that you didn't wanna go out
with me because I was too smart for you.

Well, news flash, lady:
David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me.

You'd have to drive a railroad spike into
his brain for me to beat him at checkers.

Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language
gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes.

So my question is...

...what's up with that?

Why are you yelling at me?

Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Never mind, we're cool.

Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

Really? Why would you say that?

Because a smart guy takes the nude photos
of his wife off his cell phone...

...before he tries to take nude photos
of his girlfriend.

He tried to take nude photos of you?

That's what you took from that?

The guy is married.

Oh, yeah.

I'm sor... Oh, that's terrible.

And you. If you are so okay with the way
things are between us, why are you jealous?

Well, that...

The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible.

Nice save, genius.

- Eggnog?
- Lactose.

It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog,
like, a half an hour ago.

Smooth.

Smoother than you.

Come on, it's Christmas.
Just give me this one.

Okay.

Merry Christmas.

By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

- How's your leg?
- Very good. Thanks for asking. Come on in.

Oh, good, Penny,
you're here to exchange gifts.

You'll be pleased to know
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

Okay. Here.

I should note,
I'm having some digestive distress...

...so if I excuse myself abruptly,
don't be alarmed.

Oh, a napkin.

Turn it over.

"To Sheldon. Live long and prosper.

Leonard Nimoy."

Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the
napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?

Well...

Yeah, yeah, I guess.
But look, he signed it.

Do you realize what this means?

All I need is a healthy ovum
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy.

Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin,
Sheldon.

Be right back.

- Here, open it.
- Oh.

Oh.

A gift certificate for motorcycle lessons.

- Very thoughtful.
- Yeah, and I checked.

Not letting the bike fall on you
while standing still is lesson one.

Oh, then I think you'll appreciate
what I got you.

Okay.

"101 Totally Cool Science Experiments
for Kids."

You know,
because you're so into science.

Sheldon, what did you do?

I know.

It's not enough, is it?

Here.

Leonard, look. Sheldon's hugging me.

It's a Saturnalia miracle.

[English - US - SDH]

All right, that's the last servo.

Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional
Neutralization and Termination Eradicator.

Or...

ALL:
Monte.

Featuring one articulated
razor-sharp killing saw...

...one polycarbonate grinding wheel...

...steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom.

Enough horsepower to drive
110 pounds of mechanized death...

...from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.

Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?

As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

ALL:
One, two, three. Unh.

RAJESH: Okay, what shall be first
to taste the wrath of Monte?

Maybe we should start small.

RAJESH: Okay. Oh, perhaps today
is the day we finally find out...

...what's inside the Magic 8 Ball.

Did it when I was 4.

It's an icosahedral die
floating in tinted blue water.

Man, call spoiler alert
before you say things like that.

How about the toaster oven?

What did the toaster oven ever do to you?

What did I do to Jimmy Mullins
in the third grade?

He still punched me in the face
with my own fists.

Sorry, you little nerd. You were just
in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.

Gentlemen, goggles.

Yeah, this is an auspicious moment.

Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong...

...we need the appropriate words
to mark this historic scientific event.

How about, "Die, toaster, die"?

That'll do it.

All right, what's next?

No, I think I'm just gonna stay in tonight
and do laundry.

[SCREAMS]

Oh, yeah. This door got the full monty.

PENNY: Leonard?
- Uh-huh?

What the hell?

- A killer robot. We built it.
- Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

So who exactly does it wanna kill?

I'm sorry, are you unaware
of the upcoming...

...Southern California Robot
Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?

You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

It's a big deal, heh.

There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

I know the other fellas
would be really excited to see a girl there.

How is it supposed to be a dance
if I'm the only girl?

Well, that may be a slight exaggeration.

You'd be the only doable girl.

You're a pig, Howard.

How is doable
anything but a compliment?

- Why don't we work on the robot?
- Please, Leonard, not now.

Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

Our... Our tango?

The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro.

But as delicious
as the appetizer might be...

...at some point we will have to succumb
and eat the entrÃ©e while it's still...

[MIMICS SIZZLING]

...hot.

I'm begging you, stop talking.

Look, normally, I can just ignore you.

I mean, I get it. You're a little peculiar.
Like Sheldon.

Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room,
you're the one who's peculiar.

Yeah, you might be right.

But back to you. You think you're some
sort of smooth-talking ladies' man...

...but the truth is
you are just pathetic and creepy.

Um...

So, what are you saying?

I am saying it is not a compliment
to call me doable.

It is not sexy to stare at my ass
and say:

[AS HOWARD] "Ooh, it must be jelly,
because jam don't shake like that."

[IN NORMAL VOICE] Most important,
we are not dancing a tango.

We're not to-ing and fro-ing.

Nothing is ever gonna happen
between us. Ever.

Wait a minute. This isn't flirting.
You're serious.

Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you?
I am not flirting with you.

No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.
You're just gonna grow old and die alone.

Thanks for the heads up.

- Howard, where are you going?
- I'm going home...

...to live my creepy, pathetic life.

Wow.

Well, y... Someone had to say it.

[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

[CHUCKLES]

- What?
- Uh, he said maybe we should enter you...

...in the killer-robot competition.

[RAJESH CHUCKLING]

[PHONE RINGING]

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, the phone is ringing!

Here's a crazy idea, Ma: answer it!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Hello?

All right, hold on.

It's your friend, Leonard!

He wants to know
why you're not at school today.

I don't go to school, Ma.

I work at a university.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: That's a school.
Now pick up the phone.

I don't wanna talk to anybody.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Should I ask Leonard
to bring over your homework?

I don't have homework.

I'm a grown man
with a Master's degree in Engineering!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

Want me to get you a popsicle?

Cherry, please.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I ate the cherry. All that's left is green.

You make me wanna kill myself.

- What's going on?
- I don't know.

Now they're just yelling about popsicles.

- Sounds like Penny really got to him.
- I'm not surprised.

Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

Do you know he writes poetry?

Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave...

...but he does it with real sensitivity.

[LISPING]
Hey, Hofstadter.

Word around the plasma lab
is you built a robot?

- Yes, we did, Kripke.
- His name is Monte.

Well, if you have any delusions about
entering him against the Kripke Crippler...

...in the Southern California Robot Fighting
League Round Robin Invitational...

...AKA the SCRFLRRI...

...his name is gonna be Scrap Metal.

Come on. Is that really necessary?

Leonard, I believe it is.

This is trash talk.

Trash talk is a traditional component
in all sporting events.

[CLEARS THROAT]

Kripke...

...your robot is inferior
and it will be defeated by ours...

...because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

Oh, snap.

If that is a result of a glandular condition
and not gluttony...

...I withdraw that comment.

What difference does it make?
Fat is fat.

There are boundaries.

Tell you what, forget the SCRFLRRI.

- Let's settle this roboto a roboto.
- What do you mean?

There's no guarantee we're gonna go
against each other, so let's throw down.

You know, unless you're afraid.

We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

- Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics lab.
- Make it so.

No, don't make it so.

Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow.
Our engineer is incapacitated.

What's wrong with him?

He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

We're all pathetic and creepy
and can't get girls.

That's why we fight robots.

If you're not there,
you'll be exposed to ridicule.

I'm curious, what part of America
is that accent from?

- Hey.
- Hey, you got a minute?

Yeah, come on in. What's up?

- I need you to apologize to Howard...
- Get out.

Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his
house and we need him for a robot battle.

Then have the robot go and get him.

- The robot didn't hurt his feelings.
- His feelings needed to be hurt.

He's been in bed for two days.

Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.

He's not with a...

Does it really matter who
or what he's with?

The... The guy is devastated.

Oh, please.
How could I possibly devastate Howard?

Okay, don't take this as a criticism...

...but you do kind of have that
overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.

What does that mean?

You know. Like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner.

But then when you get angry,
you kind of turn into like, you know:

[GROWLS]

I turn into a bear?

Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?

You didn't get The Incredible Hulk
from that?

Never mind.
Just... Please, just go talk to him.

Oh, and say what? That I didn't mean it?
Because I meant it.

Well, maybe you can go at it
from a different angle.

Like, you see a glimmer
of goodness in him...

...and you only said what you said because
you want to nurture it and make it shine.

Oh, pbbt!

Okay, let's try it this way.

Remember the day we first met...

...and you asked me to go to your
boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back?

And he was 9 feet tall
and he took my pants off and you said...

What was that? What did you s...?

Oh, yes. You said you owed me one.

Okay, come on, that's not fair.

I came home with no pants.

Fine. I'll go over there tomorrow.

Thank you.

I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

What about her?

She's a delightful woman.
You'll love her.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
there's a blond girl, Patsy, here to see you.

Who?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.

I don't wanna talk to her.

- Hey.
- Ma.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
She ran past me.

Was I supposed to tackle her?

So I just came by
to see how you were doing.

I'm fine.

Good.

Your mom seems nice.

People move away from her on the bus.

What do you want?

Okay, look, Howard...

...I just want to apologize.

For some things that I have said.

About you.

I've been informed
that you have feelings...

...and apparently, I have hurt them.

So I'm sorry.

Howard.

Fine. You're sorry. Goodbye.

So you're okay?

Hey, I'm a big boy.

I'm not traumatized by some random
comment from some random woman.

I mean, get over yourself.

Okay. Well...

...bye.

[HOWARD SOBBING]

So close.

[CRASHING ON COMPUTER]

Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?

KRIPKE [ON COMPUTER]:
As you can see...

...the Crippler is reducing
the Chevy Cavalier to rubble.

I can't watch anymore.

- Sheldon, we have to call it off.
- We don't have that option.

We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.

Oh, please. We've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.

Personally, I can squeeze through
a hole in a fence half my size.

Well, impressive as that may be,
Monte is not us.

Monte has no fear.

Sheldon, did we all
not just watch the same video?

Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.

You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against.

And we can modify Monte
so that he's prepared.

You wanna prepare him?

Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.

How are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?

- Have you heard from Penny?
- Not yet.

Have faith, gentlemen.

We don't need Wolowitz.

Engineering is merely
the slow younger brother of physics.

Watch and learn.

Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

And then when I was 14...

...I met Marcy Grossman.

She was so beautiful.

She just got her braces off...

...but they left a little of the overbite.

It was so hot.

Like a sexy little chipmunk.

I didn't have the courage
to ask her out...

...but I dedicated a song to her
at the ninth-grade talent show.

Aw, that sounds sweet.

[SINGING TO THE TUNE OF "MY GIRL"]
Marcy Grossman is sunshine

On a cloudy day

When it's cold outside

Marcy Grossman is the month of May

Oh, it's cute.

I guess you'd say

What can make me feel this way?

Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman
Marcy Grossman

Talkin' 'bout Marcy

That's great.

Grossman

Ha, it's fun.

And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth...

...and spit in my hair.

Which brings us to 10th grade.

Howard, do you think
maybe sometimes...

...you try too hard?

[SCOFFS]

Look at me.

What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

Well, you have a terrific chance.

You're smart, you're funny,
you have a cool job.

- You build stuff that goes into outer space.
- I guess.

No, look, I've known you
for a year and a half...

...and this is the first time
I feel like I'm talking to a real person.

And you know what? I like him.

He's a nice guy.

You really think so?

Yes.

I don't know.

No, I do.

[CHUCKLES]

[HEARTBEAT POUNDING
IN SLOW MOTION]

Nice little bot you've got here.

I'm aware.

What's this do, spin?

Yep. At 3400 rpm.

It can cut through steel
like it was rubber.

Neat.

Good work.

Sheldon, we've gotta call this off.

No, Leonard.

For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies...

...and humiliating wedgies
and the insensitively named Indian burns.

- Well, that stops now.
- Sheldon, we don't have a chance.

The only improvement
you were able to make...

...was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.

What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers
from a fatal flaw:

Overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.

That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.

Kripke.

I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker...

...but as you are its maker,
clearly the two of you have met.

What is his problem?

Way to bust out
the Jedi mind tricks, dude.

I wanna make sure that
we're all clear.

Standard Robotic
Fighting League rules apply.

Are you crazy?

This is a street fight.

The street has no rules.

He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

I will, however, give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now...

...and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

Never. I'd rather see Monte dead
than in your hands.

That could be easily arranged.

Ready, set, go?

- Do it.
- All right, then.

Ready, set, go.

- Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
- Indeed.

We are prepared for anything
he can throw at us.

That's new.

Run, Monte, run.

RAJESH: Run, Monte.
LEONARD: Go. Go, Monte, go.

- Run, Monte.
- Go, go, go.

Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,
don't hurt us.

Well, so much for making up
for the emotional wounds of childhood.

I did this.

Monte was killed
by my hubris and my pride.

No matter what anybody says,
this is my fault.

No one's arguing with you, dude.

I got your text. How bad is...? Oi.

Forget the robot. What happened to you?

- He slipped and fell.
- Yes.

I slipped and fell.

In the bathroom.

Bounced right off the tub.

Yes. Now he knows
what bathtubs are capable of doing...

...when you don't treat them
with respect.

Yeah.

They sucker-punch you
when your eyes are closed.

So, what do you think, Howard?

It... It's not that bad, right?

Yeah, no.
A little electrical tape, some solder...

Are you insane?

I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.

You're right.

Monte's gone.

We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

Leonard, you'll play your cello.

Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little
carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.

Just a toy robot?

Penny.

I know, I got it.

Sheldon? I'm sorry.

Well, don't get the wrong idea.

The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.

[English - US - SDH]

Mm.

Gentlemen, I put it to you:

The worst tapioca pudding...

...is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor.

First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

- It is extracted from the plant...
- Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

Oh, no kidding.

- A Fu Manchu, a handlebar, pencil?
- It's extracted from...

I'm not sure yet.
You know, George Clooney has one now.

Really? I once saw him
shopping at Ralphs.

He was buying tequila.

Wow, you'd think a guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

All right, this is cruel.

We better let him finish
before his head explodes.

All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca...?

Tapioca is extracted
from the root of Manihot esculenta.

Due to a high concentration of cyanide...

...it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

Feel better now?

It's indigenous to Brazil, as is the cocoa
bean from which we get chocolate.

You promised
you wouldn't do that anymore.

- Hey, Hofstadter.
- Hey, Kripke.

Heard about your anti-proton
decay experiment.

Twenty thousand data runs
and no statistically significant results.

Very impressive.

What a jerk.

Don't feel bad, Leonard.
Negative results are still results.

- Even 20,000 of them.
- All right.

Please don't cheer me up anymore.

Come on, don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.

That's why he eats by himself
instead of sitting here at the cool table.

For shizzle.

Hey, it's true, Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.

But he controls
the new Open Science Grid computer...

...that I need to run simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.

Good luck getting time on it. The only
people he lets use it are his friends.

Well, then, the solution is simple.

I shall befriend him.

Kripke.

Yeah?

What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?

I would say...

...I have no interest
in becoming your friend.

Really?
Oh, that seems rather shortsighted...

...coming from someone
who is considered altogether unlikable.

Take some time to reconsider.

Yeah, I'll do that.

Well, I think we're off to a terrific start.

There you go.
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz...

...will go right into your spam folder.

Thanks. The e-mail doesn't bother me...

...as much as the vacation pictures
of him in a bathing suit.

Yeah, I got the same one.

And that's not a bathing suit,
it's a tan line.

Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

Barry, it was pleasant seeing you today
in the cafeteria.

I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.

Apparently, you did not know
that the chef's salad...

...is kitchen trickery
to utilize scrap meat.

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.

I'm following up
on our pending friendship.

And I look forward
to hearing from you regarding its status.

Sheldon Cooper.

What's up with Ichabod?

Oh, he's trying to make a new friend.

Oh, really? Well, good for him.

Unless he makes one out of wood
like Geppetto...

...I don't think it's gonna happen.

Well, how did you guys become friends?

There was a flyer on the bulletin board
at the university:

"Roommate wanted.
Whistlers need not apply."

And you moved in anyway?

I assumed he was joking.

You'd be surprised how many
particle physicists have a whimsical side.

What about Howard and Raj?
How did he become friends with them?

I don't know. How do carbon atoms
form a benzene ring?

Proximity and valence electrons.

Well, yeah, sure,
when you put it that way.

But it all worked out, right?

I suppose.

I do miss whistling though.

Oh, come on. Really?

First warning.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

This is for you.

Hello, Sheldon.

Hi.

- What is this?
- It's a questionnaire I devised.

I'm having some difficulty bonding
with a colleague at work...

...so I'm doing a little research to better
understand why my current friends like me.

Yes, well, that is a good question.

But is this really the best way
to figure it out?

I agree.

The social sciences are largely hokum.

But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response...

...to my companionship,
this is the best I can do.

Okay, question one:

"Rank the following aspects
of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal:

Intelligence,
ruthless attention to hygiene...

...playfulness, Java-applet writing"?

I know. I may have started off
with a fairly obvious one.

An aspect
of my most appealing trait:

playfulness.

Why don't you rank that number one?
You're on your own for the rest.

It should take you
no more than three hours.

Well, wait, how many questions
are on this thing?

Only 211.

Don't worry. I've kept them all
at a high-school graduate reading level.

Thanks, pal.

You got it, buddy.

Sheldon, honey, did you ever consider
making friends by being...

...I don't know, pleasant?

Well, that's certainly
a thought-provoking hypothesis.

May I suggest it
as the topic for your essay?

Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Your questionnaire, very disappointing.

I answered every question, Sheldon.

You answered the multiple choice
questions in a pattern.

A-B-B-A-C, A-B-B-A-C.

- Oh, you picked up on that, huh?
- Yeah, wait...

How could I not?

Well, uh, come on.
There's over 200 questions.

And look at some of these things.

"Sheldon is to camaraderie
as the space shuttle is to blank."

There are a number of acceptable answers.
For example, C, near-Earth transport.

But certainly not B, avocado rancher.

Your essay: I'd have better luck
making friends...

...if I wait till the Cylons take over?

Please.

Hold on. I put some real work into that.

Yes, well,
it's better than what Wolowitz did.

He drew a raccoon with what appears
to be a distended scrotum.

It's kind of cute.

- Uh, till you get to the scrotum.
- Yeah.

What hope do I have for establishing
new relationships, given that my friends...

...could not take a few hours
out of their lives to help me?

Well, Sheldon, I'm not going
to defend a big-balled raccoon.

Oh, I don't see how you could.

Ugh. What I'm trying to say
is that you can't approach this...

...as a purely intellectual exercise.

What do you mean?

Well, ah, remember when you tried to learn
how to swim using the Internet?

I did learn how to swim.

On the floor.

The skills are transferable.

I just have no interest
in going in the water.

Then why learn how to swim?

The ice caps are melting, Leonard.

In the future,
swimming isn't going to be optional.

But you do bring up an interesting point.
I don't have to break new ground here.

I'm sure the research already exists.

No. No, my point is
if you wanna learn how to make friends...

...then just go out to a coffee shop
or a museum.

Meet people. Talk to them.
Take an interest in their lives.

That's insane on the face of it.

- Come on.
- Where are we going?

You're driving me to the mall
to acquire a book...

...that summarizes the current theories
in the field of friend making.

Why don't you just lie down on the floor
and swim there?

"Coping With the Death of a Loved One."

- My condolences.
- Thank you.

Family or friend?

- Family.
- Too bad.

If it had been a friend,
I'm available to fill the void.

It's just as well.
She smelled like mothballs.

Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people,
I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

Excuse me.

Do you have any books
about making friends?

Um, yeah, but they're all for kids.

Oh, I assume the skills
can be extrapolated and transferred.

Uh, I guess. They're right over there
by the wooden train set.

Oh! I love trains.

I bet you do.

Oh, my, that's awfully sticky.

All right.

Let's see.

"Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now."

That's probably
about homosexual rabbits.

"Gerry the Gerbil
and the Bullies on the Bus."

Read it, not helpful.

Ooh. Well, here we go.

"Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo."

"Author Sarah Carpenter...

...lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana...

...with her husband
and best friend, Mark...

...and their cockatoo, Stu."

Hardly makes her an expert
in making friends, wouldn't you agree?

I don't like birds. They scare me.

Me too.

Most people don't see it.

What are you reading?

Curious George.

Oh, I do like monkeys.

Curious George is a monkey.

Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes.

Say...

...maybe sometime you and I
could go see monkeys together.

- Would you like that?
- Okay.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

I'm making friends with this little girl.

- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

Hi, Rebecca.
I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

- No, you're not. Let's go.
- I...

We were really hitting it off.

Don't look up, there's cameras.

I'm curious, in the "How Well Do
You Know Sheldon?" section...

...what did you put
for his favorite amino acid?

Lysine.

Damn it, I had lysine and changed it.

Oh, good. You're just in time.

I believe I've isolated the algorithm
for making friends.

Sheldon, there is no algorithm
for making friends.

Hear him out. If he's onto something,
we could open a booth at Comic-Con...

...make a fortune.

You see, my initial approach to Kripke
had the same deficiencies...

...as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo
when he was new at the zoo.

Stu the Cockatoo?

Yes. He's new at the zoo.

It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence
into a simple flow chart...

...that will guide me through the process.

Have you thought about putting him
in a crate...

...while you're out of the apartment?

Hello, Kripke.
Yeah, Sheldon Cooper here.

It occurred to me you hadn't returned
any of my calls...

...because I hadn't offered any suggestions
for pursuing our friendship.

Yeah, perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.

Yeah, I see.

Well, then perhaps you'd have time
for a hot beverage?

Popular choices include tea,
coffee, cocoa.

I see. No, no, no, wait.
Don't hang up yet.

But what about a recreational activity?

I bet we share some common interests.

Tell me an interest of yours.

Really? On actual horses?

Tell me another interest of yours.

Oh, I'm sorry. I have no desire to get
in the water till I absolutely have to.

Tell me another interest of yours.

- Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
- I can fix it.

Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

It's interesting but isn't ventriloquism
by definition a solo activity?

Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.

Hmm.

Is there any chance you like monkeys?

Yeah, what is wrong with you?

Everybody likes monkeys.

Hang on, Kripke.

A loop counter and an escape
to the least objectionable activity.

Howard, that's brilliant.

I'm surprised you saw that.

Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?

All right. That last interest strikes me
as the least objectionable.

And I would like to propose
that we do that together.

Tomorrow.

Yes, I'll pay.

All right, goodbye.

All right.

Time to learn rock climbing.

You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism.

Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

He could talk while you drink.

Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

This appears significantly more monolithic
than it did on my laptop.

You know, one expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

- Hey, you afraid of heights, Cooper?
- Hardly.

A fear of heights is illogical.

Fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.

What would you say
is the minimum altitude...

...I need to achieve to cement
our newfound friendship?

Come on, they have birthday parties here.
Little kids climb this.

Little kid hominids, perhaps.

So is this your entire job?

Your parents must be so proud.

Let's go, Cooper.

Coming, Kripke.

Okay, harness seems to be secure.

A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the website said that's to be expected.

Hey.

This isn't so bad.

It's a bit like vertical swimming.

Look at you.
You're almost halfway to the top.

I am? I...

I was wrong.

It is a fear of heights.

- You all right there, Cooper?
- Not really.

I feel like an inverse tangent function
that's approaching an asymptote.

- Stuck?
- What part of "inverse tangent function...

...approaching an asymptote"
did you not understand?

I understood all of it, I'm not a moron.

Just keep going.

Yeah, I don't think I can.

Well, then climb back down.

No, that doesn't seem any more likely.

So, what's the plan, Cooper?

Well, it's not exactly a plan
but I think I'm going to pass out.

I'm sorry,
can we just do it one more time?

Okay.

One, two. One, two, three and...

It's a little thing but you really do miss it.

Hello, everyone.

I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke,
home for dinner.

Hello to you too.

How was rock climbing?

He passed out.

Just hung there like a big salami.

Eh, eh, eh. That's where I sit.

Ooh, you have a special spot.
What kind of wacko are you?

How much time you got?

You want some Chinese food?

Terrific. Got any dental floss?

In the bathroom.

Be right back.

I gotta floss the lndian food out of my teeth
if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

Sheldon, are you okay?

Oh, yes. I pass out all the time.

But it was worth it. I've made substantial
progress in bonding with Kripke...

...which brings me
to an awkward moment.

- What's that?
- Maintaining five friendships...

...promises to be a Herculean task.

So I'm going to have
to let one of you go.

Me, me, let it be me.

Leonard, you are my roommate,
my source of transportation...

...and you help me fold my sheets
when they come out of the dryer.

You are safe.

- Can I whistle?
- Don't be silly.

Howard...

...you do not have a Ph.D.

Your cologne is an assault on the senses.

And you're not available for video games
during the Jewish High Holidays.

- Guilty as charged. I'm out.
- No.

You, too, are safe.

Come on. What do I have to do?

Okay, you know what?
I see where this is going.

I'm not one of you guys.

- I'm not a scientist, so...
Penny...

...everything you're saying is true,
but please allow me to continue.

Raj, you're out.

It's a good question.

While you do provide
a certain cultural diversity...

...to a homogenous group, your responses
to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

How could you for a moment think
that my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

- He had lysine but changed it.
- Yeah.

Should have, would have,
could have, Raj.

I like to floss before I eat...

...so my gum pockets
are open for new food.

Ew.

Hello.

How did I walk past you?

I'm Barry.

- Penny.
- Eh, that's not a very hot name.

I'm gonna call you "Roxanne."

Ooh, pot stickers.

Suddenly, I'm looking pretty good, huh?

So, uh, Kripke,
I was wondering if there's any chance...

...you could get me some time
on the Open Science Grid computer?

No.

No?

But we're friends.

I'm sorry. No, my friend.

I'm confused.

I was given to understand that you allow
your friends time on the machine.

No, that's wrong.
There's an official schedule.

I have no control over it.

Oh. This entire endeavor seems
to have been an exercise in futility.

Raj, you're back in.

He likes monkeys.

You gotta give him credit
for sticking with it.

I didn't think he had it in him.

And he almost made it to the top
this time.

Hmm.

The problem appears to be unsolvable.

Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.

There are many variables.
It would take forever.

We've gotta be missing something.

Okay. Let's start again.

The movie is playing here at 7:20,
here at 7:40...

...here at 8: 10, and here at 8:45.

All right.
These theaters have to be eliminated.

Why? They're state of the art:
digital projection, surround sound.

Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.

They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines.
No lumbar support can compensate for that.

It's gonna take an hour to eat and I don't
see a Sheldon-approved restaurant...

...proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.

- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.

The delay would result in tomorrow
morning's bowel movement at work.

Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

We smuggle Slurpees, which are
essentially Icees, in under our coats...

...after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

Wow.

- I don't see how we missed that.
SHELDON: Excuse me?

In what universe are Slurpees Icees?

That's how we missed it.

Would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis...

...to create an emergency
ad hoc Slurpee-Icee equivalency?

Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.

Okay, I guess we only have one option.

Yup, I don't see any way around it.

- Bye, Sheldon.
- See you.

Later, dude.

They're right. It was the only option.

- Oh. Oh. Shut the door, Shut the door.
- Why?

Just do it.

- Get inside and shut the door.
- Well, you didn't specify.

- Is Leonard around?
- He went to the movies without me.

It was the only option.

I'm sorry, I don't know understand
which social situation this is.

Could you give me some guidance
how to proceed?

[SIGHS]

The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs...

- ...and I haven't paid my rent.
- Oh, I see.

I'm not comfortable harboring
a fugitive...

...from the 2311
North Los Robles Corporation.

It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills.

They cut back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.

If you recall...

...I pointed out the "check engine" light
to you several months ago.

No, the "check engine" light is fine.
It's still blinking away.

It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

It cost me, like, $1200 to fix it.

You know, it occurs to me. You could solve
all your problems by obtaining more money.

Yes, it occurs to me too.

Hang on a moment.

[PENNY GASPS]

Here. Take some.

Pay me back when you can.

Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

That's why it's guarded by snakes.

- Take some.
- Don't be silly.

I'm never silly.

- Here.
- No, I can't.

- Don't you need money?
- Well, yeah, but...

This is money I'm not using.

But what if you need it?

My expenses account for 46.9 percent
of my after-tax income.

The rest is divvied up
between a small savings account...

...this deceptive container
of peanut brittle...

...and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure...

...who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

Or her own protection.

- Take some.
- Really? I mean, are you sure?

I see no large upcoming expenditures.

Unless they develop technology
to fuse my skeleton...

...with Adamantium like Wolverine.

Are they working on that?

I sincerely hope so.

Okay. Well, thank you.

Hmm.

Ah, hmm.

Oh, God, no, I can't.

Look, Sheldon, honey, I don't want things
to be weird between us.

Won't it also be weird if I have to say
hello to you on my way to work...

...and you're living in a refrigerator box
and washing your hair with rain water?

I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

Of course you will.

It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

Assuming you've subscribed to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

I'm regretting this already.

You know,
I've given the matter some thought...

...and I think I'd be willing to be a house
pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

Interesting.

Ask me why.

Do I have to?

Of course. That's how you move
a conversation forward.

Why?

The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

Additionally...

...I like having my belly scratched.

- Hey, Penny. How was work?
- Great.

I hope I'm a waitress at
the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

Was that sarcasm?

No.

Was that sarcasm?

Yes.

- Was that sarcasm?
- Stop it.

Penny?

- You appear to have a package here.
- Oh, thanks.

It must be the beret I ordered.

A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

Did you know the beret
is an example...

...of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?

Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

He's not lying.
He does find that fascinating.

Okay, look, whatever.

It's not like I'm running up and down
the streets buying berets.

I bought one a month ago
when it was back-ordered. It finally arrived.

- All right?
- All right.

Oh, my God,
would you just get off my case?

- Weird.
- Oh, good.

That was an unusual interaction.
I wasn't sure.

- You guys have an argument?
- No.

You clearly did something
to aggravate her.

SHELDON:
I'm at a loss.

If you like, you can review my daily log
of social interactions...

...and see if there's a blunder
I overlooked.

Here you go.

Oh, you owe me another $2.
The price of moo shu pork went up.

[SIGHS]

It's getting tougher and tougher
to be a bad Jew.

Here you go, Penny.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.

Thank you. What's my share?

- Uh, don't worry about it. It's my treat.
- No, really. How much?

It's whatever. Ten, $11.

Well, which is it? Ten or 11?

Fourteen-fifty. But it's no biggie.

You'll get the next one.

[BOTH LAUGH]

What?

He was just wondering
if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top...

...if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.

What are you saying?
That I'm using my body to get dinner?

That I'm some sort of
Chinese food prostitute?

Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?

Let me tell you something,
I pay my own way in this world.

I don't rely on anybody.

- What was that about?
- He has a nervous bladder...

...when he's stressed out.

Kind of like a puppy.

Here, Leonard. Ten, 11, uh, 12... $14.

It's 14.50, but it's okay.

Oh, good. Dinner's here.

Yes, dinner's here.
And I'm having takeout food.

- Okay.
- You're damn right it's okay.

I've been having leftovers for four days and
I wanted something different. So sue me.

Forgive me, Penny, but that would be
the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

I will pay you back as soon as I can.
You just have to give me time.

- Oh, wait. You lent her money?
- She needed money.

You seem under pressure.
Did I not lend you a sufficient amount?

I can give you more.

Oh, you know, you would just love that,
wouldn't you?

Yeah.

You would just love to open up
your little snake can...

...and throw some money at the girl
who can't pay her bills.

[SIGHS]

- Where are you going?
- Going home.

Where I won't be interrogated
like a criminal.

I forgot my fortune cookie.

In case either of you
have larceny in your heart...

...you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey.
- Hey.

A little mood lighting, huh?

Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill,
the Department of Water and Power...

...thought I would enjoy the ambience.

Yeah, they're very considerate that way.

I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.
Then I had, like, $14 left over.

Fourteen dollars, huh?

Put it back in your pocket
or I'll find another place to put it.

Back in the pocket it goes.

Look, you do understand that Sheldon
doesn't care when he gets the money back.

It's actually one
of the few idiosyncrasies...

...that doesn't make you wanna,
you know, kill him.

Yeah, well,
that's not really my big problem.

You're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on bills.

Yeah, I know, it's just...
This wasn't the plan.

It wasn't supposed to go this way.

Hey, well, what was the plan?

Um, waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

Uh-huh.

Was there a Plan B?

TV star.

Well, it's probably not as bad as you think.
Let's take a look.

Maybe we can find some corners to cut.

Oh, here's something.

If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

Just a suggestion.

A hundred and seventy dollars
for acting classes?

Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes.
I'm a professional actress.

Oh.

You had an acting job
where you got paid?

[SCOFFS]

That is not the definition of professional.

Actually, it kind of is. Let's keep looking.

Whoa.

What's $1800
to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?

Oh, that's nothing.

Nothing?

It sounds like you got caught speeding
going 4000 miles an hour.

Well, remember Kurt?

Your ex-boyfriend?

Yeah, he got arrested
for taking a whiz on a cop car.

- What?
- He was drunk.

I would hope so.

He had a bunch of outstanding tickets
and a bench warrant, so I...

You know, I paid his fines.

Did he pay you back?

No, but he will.

And that's based
on the inherent credit-worthiness...

...of people who get drunk
and urinate on police vehicles?

Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

Oh?

What are you gonna do?

I don't know but I might have to find
a cheaper place to live.

Oh, no.

No, you don't wanna do that.

Why not?

Uh, moving is a big deal.

Uh, you... You have to go
to the supermarket and get boxes...

...and if they're not clean
then your books smell like melons and it's...

Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

Well, do you know anybody?

Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

Oh, Leonard, honey,
if we started living together...

...I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

Really?

And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

Ugh. This moo shu pork's burning a hole
through my duodenum.

Tsk, tsk. Leviticus 11:3.

That which parteth the hoof and cheweth
the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.

Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad Gita
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

- Hey, what's going on?
- We're on a quest to the Valley of Fire.

You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

Hey, you guys wanna go
on a real live quest?

Outside? I just made cocoa.

Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

What is it?

Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

Yeah, that's him.

Uh, it turns out he owes Penny a lot
of money and I'm gonna go get it from him.

Who's with me?

Ooh, double sixes.

Really?
You're just gonna let me go by myself?

Oh, cool, I got a sword.

I could use some help.

Here.

You guys are unbelievable.

You play a game to simulate adventure,
but when there's adventure...

...in the real world you just wimp out.

Leonard, do you not recall the last time
we visited this gentleman?

We returned home without pants.

- I do.
- Are you sure?

Because your proposal suggests
that you don't.

I'm not afraid of him.

All right.
Leonard fairly calls the question:

Who is in favor
of abandoning our game...

...and confronting
Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend...

...in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

Say hi to Kurt for us.

Excuse me.

When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor...

...didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go?

- They did.
- Well?

They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

Plus, no one stole their pants.

Fine.

Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

Leonard, wait.

Take a jacket, it's shpritzing a little.

You guys suck.

Come on, please. He's so big.

- Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
- Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself...

...I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's
gonna run away, and you're going to die.

Shall we synchronize our watches?

Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

Minstrels will write songs about him.

Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking,
you stand behind me and try to look...

...formidable.

I should've peed before we left.

Yeah?

- Hi, Kurt.
- Lenny, right?

I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay. Um...

You remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

No.

- What do you want?
- You don't remember me?

- How could he not remember?
- Sheldon, not now.

I remember him.

Okay, here it is.
Penny's in kind of a financial jam...

...and the money you owe her would
go a long way to solving her problems.

- And she sent you to get it from me?
- No, she's too proud to ask for the money.

I, on the other hand,
feel you should honor your debt.

You do?

"Feel" is kind of a...
It's a strong word. Uh...

But I just... I think it'd be a nice gesture
on your part.

She'll get it when she gets it.

Well, there you go. Problem solved.

A successful quest. Now let's find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

No, the problem isn't solved.

He just blew us off.

I've got it.

He didn't remember me, because the last
time we met I was in a Halloween costume.

- Come on, Leonard, let's go.
- No. You can leave if you want to.

- I'm gonna see this through.
- Okay.

I guess technically that was my fault.

I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

What happened to your backup?

I don't need backup.

I have right on my side.

And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

Congratulations.

You may not have succeeded
in getting cash...

...but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

Maybe we should have your head
notarized.

If anybody cares, I still have to pee.

Hey.

- Is Sheldon here?
- Yeah, hang on.

Sheldon.

- Nice hat.
- You know?

It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

- Hello, Penny.
- Sheldon, here is your money.

Thank you very much, it helped a lot.

Sarcasm?

- No.
- Darn.

I can't seem to get the hang of that.

Hey, I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said...

...and picked up more hours
at the restaurant.

The biggest thing was, out of the blue,
Kurt shows up...

...and gives me the money he owes me.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

Really?

Did he say why?

Yes. He said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

That's it?

Did he give any reason
as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

Nope. I just think he's really changed.

We're having dinner tomorrow night.
And I get to wear my new beret. Ha, ha.

Bye, guys.

Bye.

Well done, Leonard.

The true hero doesn't seek adulation.

He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

Penny's hooking up
with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend...

...and I have indelible ink
on my forehead.

That's your badge of honor. They're your,
uh, warrior's wound, if you will.

I was wrong.

Minstrels will write songs about you.

Great.

[SINGING]
There once was a brave lad named Leonard

With a fi-fi-fiddle dee-dee

He faced a fearsome giant

While Raj just wanted to pee

[English - US - SDH]

[PLAYING RED HOT CH ILI PEPPERS'
"UNDER THE BRIDGE"]

[SINGING]
And I don't ever wanna feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way

[SINGING IN FALSETTO]
And I don't ever wanna feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I love...

[SQUEALS]

[MUSIC STOPS]

Fellas, please.

Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

You found it. It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

Well, I'm really very busy.

Is there any way we can put this off
until I have more time to prepare?

Of course,
but, uh, you understand my trepidation.

- What's that about?
- Not a clue.

Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

Maybe next summer?

This should be fairly easy to deduce.

He's holding the phone to his left ear.
Ears do not cross hemispheres.

He's using the analytical,
rather than emotional side of the brain...

...suggesting that he has
no personal relationship with the caller.

No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

Sure. I guess there's no other choice
but to go ahead and do it.

He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

- It's gonna be uncomfortable.
SHELDON: Yes, yes.

I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.

Okay, bye.

My mother's coming to visit.

How about that? You were right.

It's out of order.

Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

Again, I can read the sign.

But the sign and tape are covered
with a layer of dust which indicates...

...the elevator has been nonfunctional
for an amount of time...

...which suggests either a remarkable
passivity among the...

...I assume 24 to 36 residents
of this building...

...based on the number of mailboxes and
given typical urban population density...

...or a shared delusion of functionality.

You must be Leonard's mother.

Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.

- Uh, I'm Penny, I'm his neighbor.
- Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.

Uh, come with me,
I'll walk you to the apartment.

Oh, all right. Would you like
to exchange pleasantries on the way?

- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.

I've always been curious.
What was Leonard like when he was little?

BEVERLY: Oh, I think you mean young.
He's always been little.

Right.
What was he like when he was young?

You'll have to be more specific.

Oh, um, okay, like five or six.

- Five.
- Oh, well, at that age...

...he was in what Freud would call the
phallic stage of psychosexual development.

An outmoded theory, of course.

But the boy did spend most of his waking
hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

Oh, yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

Well, that is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.

Oh. Well, I'm an actress.

[GIGGLES]

Why?

Ha. What do you mean, why?

There were studies that suggest
many who go into the performing arts...

...suffer from an external locus
of identity.

Yeah, I don't know what that means.

Well, it means you value yourself
only as others value you...

...which is often the result
of unmet childhood emotional needs.

Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.

Tell me about it.

I know my dad wanted a boy.

[SOBBING]

I... I just... I tried being good at sports,
but I hated getting dirty.

And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

Uh-huh. He called me slugger
until I got my first training bra...

...and then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

I wasn't slugger anymore.

Your mother's here.

If you want to have intercourse with that
girl, find out what cologne her father wore.

Good to see you, mother.

Here's your tea, mother.

- Oolong?
- Yes.

- Loose, not bagged?
- Yes.

- Steeped three minutes? Two-percent milk?
- Yes. Yes.

- Warmed separately?
- Yes.

- One teaspoon sugar? Raw sugar?
- Yes. Yes.

It's cold.

I'll start again.

I have the same problem with him.

My theory is that his lack of focus
stems from an over-developed sex drive.

Oh, I don't know where he got that.

Aside from a pro-forma consummation
of our marriage...

...his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.

That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.

Yes, we think so.
We've both done papers on it.

Mine from a neuroscientific point of view
and his from an anthropological.

Mine, of course,
was the only one worth reading.

Of course.

I would very much like
to read about your sex life.

Well, it's all online or you can order it
from the Princeton University Press.

Here's your tea, Mother.

So, what are you guys talking about?

The frequency with which your parents
had intercourse.

Swell.

If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you
the PowerPoint presentation.

I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.

[GROANS]

So, Mother...

- ...what's new?
- You'll have to be more specific.

All right. Uh, what's new with you?

Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

Maybe something less personal?

Oh.

Your Uncle Floyd died.

Oh, my God. What happened?

His heart stopped beating.

I have to urinate.

What a remarkable woman.

Yeah, I... I thought
you guys might hit it off.

I envy you your childhood.

I hate to tell you...

...but the only warm memories I have
of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

You're clearly misremembering. Your mother
is brilliant, analytical, insightful.

I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible
because you wouldn't eat Brussels sprouts.

Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.

She's warm, she's loving,
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head...

...to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

You were lucky.

When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,
I had to attach my own electrodes.

So, Dr. Hofstadter...

...Leonard rarely talks about his
incredibly successful brother and sister.

- Please don't go there, Howard.
- You know, I understand...

...that unlike Leonard,
they're at the top of their respective fields.

Boy, you suck.

Leonard's younger brother, Michael,
is a tenured law professor at Harvard...

...and his sister just successfully grew
a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.

So she's close to curing diabetes?

Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

Wow, you must be very proud.

Why? They're not my accomplishments.

I have to urinate.

- Why are you doing this?
- You know the rules.

You brought your mom to work.
You must suffer.

[HOWARD CHUCKLES]

Leonard, I had no idea your siblings
were so much more successful than you.

[RAJESH CHUCKLES]

Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks
of the Hofstadter family.

[AS JAR JAR BINKS]
Oh, meesa think yousa looking so, so sad.

Rather than mock me...

...my friends might realize this is difficult
and try to help me through it.

Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.

Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work.
Okee-day?

That was fast.

Oh, the middle stall was occupied.
I'll have to try again later.

It's totally understandable.
In bladder voiding, as in real estate...

...it's location, location, location.

So where were we?

Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't
speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.

Oh, that's fascinating.
Selective mutism is quite rare.

On the other hand, an adult Jewish male
living with his mother is so common...

...it borders on sociological clichÃ©.

It's just temporary. I pay rent.

He lives in the same room
where his bassinet was.

Both selective mutism and an inability
to separate from one's mother...

...can stem from a pathological fear
of women.

It might explain why the two of you have
created an ersatz homosexual marriage...

...to satisfy your need for intimacy.

Say what?

[WHISPERS INAUDIBLY]

That's basically what I just said.

You brought your husband to work,
you know the rules.

[AS JAR JAR BINKS]
Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad...

...now too, betcha, betcha.

Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going
to show me your laboratory at 1:00?

No hurry, Mother. Tell them more
about their secret love for each other.

But it's 1:00. You were going to show me
your laboratory at 1:00.

Her reasoning is unassailable. It is 1:00.

Fine. Let's go.

I think you'll find my work
pretty interesting.

I'm attempting to replicate...

...the dark matter signal found
in sodium-iodide crystals by the Italians.

So no original research?

No.

BEVERLY:
What's the point of my seeing it?

I could just read the paper
the Italians wrote.

Okay, just for the record, we're not
in an ersatz homosexual relationship.

Well, then,
why didn't you say that to her?

- Why is it always my responsibility?
- Oh, it's not always your responsibility.

I swear, this is the same thing you did
at the comic book store last week.

I can't believe you're bringing that up.

- I didn't bring it up. You did.
- We'll talk about this later.

Well, you always say that,
but we never do.

You went to the comic book store
without me?

- Hey.
- You got alcohol?

- Mom still here?
- Yep.

Come on in.

She's not gonna come here
looking for you, is she?

Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital
to get a brain scan.

- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Nothing.

Mother likes looking at brains
and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.

Jeez, what a fun couple.

Ugh. She's only here a day and a half...

...and I'm seriously considering alcoholism
as a new career path.

I talked to her for five minutes yesterday
and I've been half bombed ever since.

You can't let her get into your head.

- My head, what about yours?
- It's too late for me.

My head is her summer house.

She was right, you know.

The locus of my identity
is totally exterior to me.

Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, mom.

Do you know where I was all morning?

Auditioning with 50 other blondes
for some stupid antidepressant commercial.

And for what?
So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?

Did you get the part?

No, they said I was too perky.

Wanna talk about not getting
love from a parent?

You know what I used to do when I was
little to have sensation of human contact?

Yeah, you grabbed your penis
and wouldn't let go.

Your mother told me.

[LEONARD SCOFFS]

Of course she did.
That's not what I was gonna say.

Uh... Uh, when I was 10-years old,
I built a hugging machine.

- A hugging machine?
- Yeah.

I got a mannequin, stuffed it
with an electric blanket so it'd be warm...

...and I built two radio-controlled arms
that would hug me and pat my back.

Oh, that is so sad.

- Know what the saddest part was?
- What?

My father used to borrow it.

Your scan data
will be very helpful to my research.

You have a remarkable brain.

I know.

Although I've always hated
how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.

Common complaint among men.

Nothing's ever big enough.

Except when they get a tumor.
Then you never hear the end of it.

Yeah, I'd love to see
a scan of your brain sometime.

Oh, I'll send you a link,
but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.

Oh, I can't believe that.

Your unwillingness to accept empirical
evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.

My apologies.

I've been living with your son too long.
Gotten into some bad habits.

Understandable.

Can I make you a cup of tea?

I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance,
it's probably you.

I feel very comfortable around you.

I feel very comfortable around you too.

It's surprising because I generally
don't feel comfortable around...

Well, anyone.

Nor I.

What are the odds...

...that two individuals
as unique as ourselves...

...would be connected by someone
as comparatively workaday as your son?

Is that a rhetorical point
or would you like to do the math?

I'd like to do the math.

I'd like that too.

[PENNY MOANS]

BOTH:
Aah!

[LEONARD GIGGLES]

[PENNY MOANS THEN COUGHS]

PENNY:
Mm.

- Oh.
- Heh-heh-heh.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

- Okay, now this time...
- Uh-huh.

...you're gonna lick the salt...

...off my neck...

...do the shot... Whoops!

...and then bite the lime.

[CHUCKLING]

I'm sorry,
I didn't hear anything after "lick."

Neck.

Shot.

Lime.

[BOTH GIGGLING]

- Okay, shot, lime.
- Right.

Dah! Where's the lime?

[BOTH GIGGLING]

Oh, okay, we're sharing.

So, what do you think?

I'm very tempted.

I'm just not sure it's appropriate
with my son's roommate.

Normally, I'd feel the same way.

But based on everything
I've observed about us...

...I can't help but speculate
we'd be very good together.

True. I've had a similar observation.

It's certainly something
I could never do with my husband.

I was hesitant the first time I tried it...

...but I experienced an unanticipated
and remarkable release of endorphins.

- It's quite satisfying.
- Mm.

I see what you're doing.

You're appealing
to the neuroscientific researcher in me.

You see right through me, don't you?

Only when you're in a CAT scanner.

[SNORTS THEN LAUGHS]

[BOTH MOANING AND LAUGHING]

This is actually gonna happen.

Honey. Shush, shush, shush.

You shush. I'm happy.
I wanna talk about it.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

You know what my mother would say?
She'd say...

...because you were not loved by your
father and I was not loved by my mother...

...that having sex is our way of making up
for intimacy we didn't get as children.

Why would you bring that up right now?

I don't know. Foreplay?

So you're saying
you're not having sex with me...

...you're having sex with your mother?

Um, I'm gonna go with no.

That is the sickest thing
I have ever heard.

Uh, come on, you're trying to have sex
with your father, and I'm okay with that.

PENNY:
Get out!

She said shush. I should have shushed.

[BOTH SINGING JOURNEY'S
"ANY WAY YOU WANT IT"]

- All night
- All night

- Oh, every night
- Oh, every night

- Hold tight
- Hold tight

SHELDON:
Baby, hold tight

[IN UNISON]
Any way you want it

That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Oh, whoa

All right, Mother.

- Um, have a nice flight.
- That's not really in my control, is it?

Oh, uh, yes.

- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

- I was just coming over to talk to you...
- You don't have to.

Ever.

Gotcha.

- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, Leonard.

So, slugger, shall we pick up
where we left off last time?

[PENNY SOBBING]

I mean, my mom could've just said,
"Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on."

But she didn't. Not one word.

Interesting. Would you be willing
to fly to New Jersey...

...and discuss your relationship
with your parents during a brain scan?

- Would it help?
- Well, it would help me.

[English - US - SDH]

[PAINTBALLS FIRING]

HOWARD:
That was close.

God, I love the smell of paintballs
in the morning.

Yeah, still funny, Raj.

[PAINTBALLS FIRING]

No way we can get to the ridge.

The Chemistry Department
has us cut off.

What about the creek bed?

The Pharmacology Department
controls that.

And they're all hopped up
on experimental steroids.

That's it then, we're doomed.

Time to acknowledge
that we are paying the price...

...for some failing to attend Physics
Department paintball strategy meeting.

I told you, my mom has spider veins.

I had to take her to the laser clinic.

And I told you I wanted
to see a doctor's note.

We need a plan.
How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?

Which one is Hammer of the Gods?

We hide in the parking lot
and ambush people when they come to pee.

No, the dumpsters are deep
in Astronomy Department territory.

Shouldn't be a problem,
Venus is up during the day.

They're probably
just all staring at the sky.

All right, what we need now
is a tactical retreat.

Did you see Stargate
where they found themselves on a planet...

...with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

Not important.

Leonard, Raj and I are gonna burst out
the door and run away.

Howard will cover us.

But why don't I run away
and you cover me?

Because you chose your mother's veins
over victory.

On three. One, two, three, go!

[ALL SCREAMING
AND PAINTBALLS FIRING]

I had to take her.
It's almost bathing-suit weather.

[PAINTBALLS FIRING]

[HOWARD SHRIEKS]

I surrender, don't shoot.
They went that way.

LESLIE:
Howard, I'm on your team.

Oh, Leslie, thank God.

- Where's the rest of your squad?
- Uh...

They left me here to die.

What about yours?

- Dead. All of them.
- Sorry.

Don't be.

It was friendly fire.

They just wouldn't listen.

Well, we're surrounded.

So I guess there's nothing for us to do
but wait to be captured or killed.

Hm. That's the worst part.

The waiting.

All the while knowing that there's a paint
pellet out there with your name on it.

Yeah.

The big wet ball of death.

[PAINTBALLS SPRAYING SHED]

Kind of makes you feel more alive,
doesn't it?

It kind of does.

I say we make every moment count.

I agree.

How exactly do we do that?

[PAINTBALLS FIRING IN DISTANCE]

LEONARD:
Howard, why aren't you covering us?

We're getting slaughtered out here.

War is hell.

Did you see the new budget memo
this morning?

Yeah, more cutbacks.

Unacceptable. It baffles me...

...why they don't simply let some of you go
so there's money available for my research.

You know what baffles me, Sheldon?

Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I would imagine.

LESLIE: Hey, guys.
- Hi, Leslie.

I got the approval
for the rapid prototyper.

That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

[GROWLS]

What was all that about?

Oh, uh, no big deal.

They gave Leslie control
over some unrestricted grant money.

Yeah, okay, but what's with
the back scratching and the meow?

I believe the back-scratching metaphor
describes a quid pro quo situation...

...where one party provides services
to the second party...

- ...in compensation for a similar action.
- Thank you.

The meow, that sounded to me
like an African civet cat.

- Are you done?
- No.

Despite what the name suggests...

...the civet cat is not a true cat.

Now I'm done.

You know what? I'm thinking Howard
wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor.

I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

What about it, Howard?

Okay, I didn't wanna say anything...

...because I know you and Leslie
have a little history.

- I don't care about that.
- Great, I'm dying to say something.

You and Leslie?

In the paintball shed. Twice.

Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

My good man.

Dereliction of duty in the face of
the enemy is a court-martial offense.

Court martial, schmort martial.

Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl
I've ever had sex with.

I mean, for free.

And plus you got a rapid prototyper.
That's an expensive piece of equipment.

The rest of us have had our budgets
cut to the bone.

Okay, one way to look at this is that
I'm getting new equipment and you're not...

...and that's unfair.

But a better way to look at this
is that I'm getting sex and you're not.

And that's delightful.

The whole thing froze.
I don't know what happened.

Calm down. We'll figure it out.

How can I calm down?
I'm gonna lose my shopping cart.

That's three hours of picking out shoes
just shot to hell.

- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.

You're in my spot.

- Are you planning on sitting here?
- No, I'm going to the comic-book store.

- What difference does it make?
- What difference?

Here we go.

That is my spot.

In an ever-changing world,
it is a single point of consistency.

If my life were expressed as a function...

...on a four-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system...

...that spot at the moment I first sat on it
would be zero, zero, zero, zero.

What?

Don't sit in his spot.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

Fine. Happy?

I'm not unhappy.

Boy, I love him,
but he is one serious whackadoodle.

Okay, that should do it.

Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.

That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

Yeah, you know the sad thing is,
it's really not.

Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?

You ought to come with us sometime.

Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

When we shoot things,
we wanna eat them...

...or make them leave
our boyfriends alone. Ha, ha.

[PAINTBALLS FIRE]

PENNY:
Oh.

Boy, your heart's racing.

I must have really gotten you going.

Well, it's partly you.

Partly my transient, idiopathic arrhythmia.

Sexy.

Can I assume that
you've likewise found the experience...?

Satisfactory?

That wasn't quite the word
I was looking for...

...but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

Hey, are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

Oh, it's great. Everybody in the Engineering
Department is eating their hearts out.

Isn't it nice when your good fortune
makes others miserable?

You know, most people don't get that.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I'm home!

- Oh, great.
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Book club was canceled.

That thing on Phyllis' neck
opened up again.

I'm busy, Ma.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Too busy to help
your mother with her zipper?

Don't come in, Ma.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Why not?
- He's got company!

Oh, there's the arrhythmia.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Is she Jewish?

- Are you Jewish?
- No.

Yes!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Okay, then you kids have fun.

Use protection.

You think he'll notice?

There's a chance.

Oh, what are we gonna do?

"We"?

No, no, no, you had your chance to be "we"
for like a year and a half now.

Right now, you are you,
and you are screwed.

- Why do we have to tell him I did it?
- Not gonna tell him I did it.

Okay, okay, how about this?

We tell him somebody broke in.

Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

I'm sorry, I buy it.
All those people are on drugs.

We could tell him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

Okay, fine.
Well, what if we just flip it over?

There. Looks fine, right?

Butt print.
There's no discernible butt print.

Oh, come on.

There. Butt print.

It's too small and too perfect.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Shh. Act normal.

Sheldon!

- How was the comic-book store?
- Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.

Great, great.

Did you walk the whole way?
It's a little chilly.

- Koothrappali picked me up.
- Isn't that terrific?

He is such a good friend.

You know what the best thing
about friends is?

They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason?

No, no, friends forgive the little things.

- I'm gonna go home and wash my hair.
- Don't you dare, missy.

Hello, fastest man alive.

Wanna see me
read your entire comic book?

Wanna see it again?

Something's wrong.

- What do you mean?
- I'm not sure.

It doesn't feel right.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh, that. Penny did that.

[WHINES]

Excuse me.

[MUMBLING]

Oh, God.

Why don't you just eat
in your desk chair?

Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

Here we go.

That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot.

I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

Whackadoodle.

You know, there's kind of
an obvious solution here. Get up.

There, problem solved.

Nobody cares where you're gonna sit.

You're not crazy.

Excuse me,
but the problem is not solved.

If your head
had been accidentally amputated...

...and we transplanted a dog's head
in its place...

...would that be "problem solved"?

If it were your head, it would be.

Sheldon, I am really, really sorry,
but it's only for a week.

Can't you be a little bit flexible?

Yeah, sorry,
I didn't really think that through.

You claim it's going to be a week.
I have no faith in your cleaner.

- Why not?
- Did you notice the sign on his counter?

He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

He also makes keys.

Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

Focus is important.

Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hair dresser?

Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Oh, looks like
I'm gonna have sex tonight.

HOWARD: Hey, baby.
- His right hand is calling him?

No, it's Leslie Winkle. It's a long story.

[SHELDON MOANING]

Sure. I'll pick you up in 10 minutes.

Gentlemen, adieu.

I thought we were gonna play
"Halo" tonight.

What am I supposed to do?

There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

You understand, right?

No, not at all.

Nevertheless, I must depart.

By the way, did I tell you Leslie pulled
strings and got me on the trip to Geneva...

...to check out the CERN super collider?

That's not fair.
You're not even a physicist.

There are two ways
of looking at this...

- Get out.
- Bye.

You're improving.

Thank you.

It helps when I get to practice
with a real woman.

Hey, listen.
Saturday, my sister's getting married.

I want you to come with me.
It's black tie.

Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

Why not?

When I go to weddings
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

I don't know
what I would do with a date.

Oh, all right.

I understand.

Thanks.

Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

- What about it?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

I had to reduce the number of people going
and you didn't make the cut.

When did that happen?

About 12 seconds ago.

Hold on. Are you saying if I don't go
to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

Well, actually, I'm trying not to say it.

Okay, I'm sorry,
but that makes me a little uncomfortable.

- How so?
- Because it's like you're controlling me...

...with new equipment
and research trips.

If I weren't controlling you with equipment
and trips, I'd be uncomfortable.

- How so?
- Because we'd be in a real relationship...

...with feelings and all that crap.

So bottom line,
I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

No.

No, no, not at all.

You're also arm candy.

So, what do you think?

Hey, Ma, you gotta rent me a tux!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Right now?

What kind of sex
are you having up there?

Why are you crouching there?

This is my spot.

Where else am I supposed to crouch?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

I don't know, Texas.

Here. Fresh from the cleaners.
Good as new.

Really? Great.
Sheldon, look. Good as new.

From that key maker? I highly doubt it.

Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.

All right.

There. Nice and comfy-cozy.
Zero, zero, zero.

There's one more zero.

You forgot the time parameter.

Sit on the damn couch.

Nope.

What do you mean "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

- It's exactly the same...
- Penny, Penny.

I know what to do.

Sheldon, I have some bad news.

More?

I'm afraid so.

You know the cashew chicken
I get you on Monday nights?

Yes, from Szechwan Palace.

Szechwan Palace closed two years ago.

What?

- Where did my cashew chicken come from?
- Golden Dragon.

No.

No, this isn't right.

No, our food always comes
in Szechwan Palace containers.

Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4000 containers.

I keep them in the trunk of my car.

But...

Oh, this changes everything.

I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

What's real? What isn't?
How can I know?

- You did make that up, right?
- Oh, God, I wish I had.

- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

I still don't like this cushion.

Okay, first of all...

- ...Penny, thank you for coming.
- Oh, thanks for the shoes.

Penny is an amazing shot. I think
we have a chance to win this week.

- What's the plan?
- Okay. Now, we all run out...

...Sheldon and I will cut to the left
behind these trees.

Raj, Howard and Leslie
flank to the right behind the rocks.

We'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone in sight.

All right, just one thing before we start.

What is it, Sheldon?

Oh!

What the hell?

That was for my cushion.

Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

I'm sorry, Leonard.
But revenge is a dish best served cold.

Screw that.

She can't shoot me. She's dead.

He's right. You can't.

Well, if we're going to descend
into anarchy...

Okay. See you.

Where are you going?

Surrender, then Denny's.

[English - US - SDH]

Okay, Raj...

...hand me the number six
Torx screwdriver.

Stop.

We can't do this. It's not right.

Sheldon, you have got two choices.

Put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo
or delete stuff before we go out of town.

But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

The warranty is a sacred covenant
we've entered into with the manufacturer.

He offers to stand by his equipment.

We in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.

This little orange sticker is all that stands
between us and anarchy.

Okay,
then we won't touch the hard drive.

We'll just erase the first season
of Battlestar.

There. We're outlaws.

- Here you go, Leonard. Is this big enough?
- It's perfect.

For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.

I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.

I understand your envy.

This is a can't-miss symposium.

There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices...

...advancements
in multi-threaded task completion...

...plus a round table on the non-equilibrium
Green's Function approach...

...to the photoionization process
in atoms.

When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.

This conference is a big thing.

The keynote address
is delivered by George Smoot.

Oh, my God. The George Smoot?

- You've heard of him?
- Of course I haven't.

George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist...

...one of the great minds of our time.

His work in black body form...

...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...

...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

It's kind of a funny name though.

Smoot.

It's like talking to a chimp.

Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

- Yeah, I wish.
- We're not flying. We're taking the train.

Oh, cool.

Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.

- Well then why are you doing it?
- Well, we had a vote.

Three voted for airplane,
Sheldon voted for train.

So we're taking the train.

Don't say it like that, Leonard.
Say it like, "We're taking the train!"

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

We're going to the Apple store
to make fun of the Genius Bar.

You wanna come?

Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

What are you doing?

I'm simplifying the task of packing
for our trip.

See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing...

...it will enable my laptop to read
and identify the items with this wand.

Then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum...

...weather conditions,
duration of trip, etc.

Well, that does sound much simpler.

How long is this gonna take?

Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours 11 minutes.

Plus however long it takes to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

Wow.

Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.

- I don't follow.
- I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

[SCANNER BEEPS]

Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

[SCANNER BEEPS]

Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

What on earth are you doing?

Whatever it is,
I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.

Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight...

...one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.

On this side,
you'll see panoramic ocean vistas...

...inaccessible
to any other form of transportation.

While on your side
you'll be treated to 350 miles...

...of Costcos, Jiffy Lubes and cinder block
homes with above-ground pools.

- Come on, Raj.
- What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

No.

- Why not?
- That's over the wheelbase.

Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics...

...of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

Sheldon,
we've been on this train 90 seconds...

...and you've already said
a thousand words.

Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

Here.

I'm hoping once you reap
the endorphic rewards...

...of the steady clickety-clack
of steel wheels on polished rails...

- ...your sour disposition will abate.
- Yeah, maybe.

Back in the 21st century, people are raising
tray tables and putting seat-backs upright...

...because it's time to land
in San Francisco.

It's not so bad really.
At least these trains have modern plumbing.

In India, you squat over a hole in the train
and expose your naked buttocks...

...to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

He is referring, of course, to third class...

...on Indian Railways' magnificent
Ranakpur Express...

...and its 1200-kilometer journey
from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.

Oh, look.
Now he's boring on an international scale.

Holy crap, look.

- Is that who I think it is?
- It can't be.

What would Summer Glau
be doing riding the train?

Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

Unlikely.
That's a television show, Leonard.

Thank you.

If Skynet did exist in the future, a perfect
way to infiltrate and destroy mankind...

...would be to send Terminators back
as actors...

...who have played Terminators
in films and television...

...lulling us into a false sense
of security, i.e.:

"That's Summer Glau
from The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

No, Summer, don't kill me!
I'm pro-robot."

[GROANING]

At least he's off the train crap.

[TRAIN STARTING]

SHELDON:
Wheeee.

Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance.
I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.

Please. When it comes to Terminators...

...you've got a better shot of scoring
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

You're overlooking something.

I have 11 hours with her
in a confined space.

Unless she's willing to jump off
a moving train...

...tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
she will eventually succumb...

...to the acquired taste
that is Howard Wolowitz.

My money's on tuck and roll.

I'm confused.

I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.

- Let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.

- That's Summer Glau.
- Yes?

That's it.

Hang on a sec.

- Why do you get first crack at her?
- Uh, well, let's see. Couple reasons.

One, I saw her first.

No, you didn't. I did.

Fair enough. But then let me move on
to number two.

Unlike you, I can actually talk to women
when I'm sober.

You fail to take into account
that even mute, I am foreign and exotic...

...while you, on the other hand,
are frail and pasty.

Well, you know the old saying.

Pasty and frail, never fail.

Excuse me, but what about me?

Why don't I get a shot?

Fine, go ahead, take a shot.

I've already got a gorgeous blonde
back home I can't score with.

I think I'll let you two take this one.

Sheldon, is there a place on this train
to get alcohol?

Interesting that you ask.

The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.

Built in 1956 and originally known as
the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level...

- Which way?
- Upper level is a bar...

...that offers wine tastings
if you're going as far as Portland.

Aren't you gonna go talk to her?

I will.
I'm just working on my opening line.

She's probably heard every possible line,
Howard.

Why don't you try, "Hello?"

No, no, no.
That always creeps girls out.

I need to come up with something that's
funny, smart and delicately suggests...

...that my sexual endowment
is disproportionate to my physical stature.

You're gonna need more than 11 hours.

Oh no.

- What's the matter?
- I forgot my flash drive.

- So?
- So we have to go back.

Okay, Sheldon, I'm gonna say, "Why?"

And your answer cannot be
"Because I forgot my flash drive."

You don't understand.

My flash drive has my paper
on astrophysical probes...

...of M-theory effects
in the early universe...

...I was gonna give to George Smoot
at the conference.

Why do you have to give your paper
to George Smoot?

It's brilliant. He needs to read it.

So you'll send him an email
when we get back.

Then I won't get to see
his face light up as he reads it.

- Right. Of course.
- Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

Well, there's nothing you can do about it,
so relax.

Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails.

[SINGING] You forgot your flash drive
You forgot your flash drive

You forgot your flash drive
You forgot your flash drive

You forgot your flash drive

Only 10 hours, 55 minutes to go.

You forgot your flash drive
You forgot your flash drive

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

So, where you gals headed?

Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

We get off the train at the next stop
in Oxnard.

We then take the 1: 13 train
back to Union Station.

We take a cab back,
get my flash drive...

...and race to San Luis Obispo, assuming
the lights are with us, minimal traffic...

...we'll meet the train.

- I've got a better idea.
- Are you going to be sarcastic?

Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.

But, look, Penny's home.

Why don't we call her, have her get
your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?

But the flash drive
is in a locked drawer in my desk.

- So?
- The key is hidden in my room.

- So?
- Penny'd have to go into my room.

- So?
- People don't go in my room.

I see. Well, it seems once again...

...you're caught
between a rock and a crazy place.

Oh, I hate when that happens.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.
It's hot in here. Must be summer.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

- That's cute.
- Really? I just made it up.

Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?

Oh yeah, I loved it.

It's loosely based on my life.

We're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater.

Can you come? Oh, great.

Do you know 98 other people
that might wanna come?

Oh, hang on. Hello?

Listen. I'm about to give you
a set of instructions...

...which you must follow to the letter.

Just a sec.

Theater's above a bowling alley
so it's a little noisy...

...but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

And the director is brilliant.

He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

Okay, great, I'll see you then.

- Hello?
SHELDON: Okay, step four.

Do you see that small plastic case
on my dresser?

Your dresser? Who is this?

It's Sheldon.

PENNY: Oh, hey, Sheldon.
How's San Francisco?

I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra...
Were you even listening to me?

- No, I was talking to my friend. What's up?
- What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

I'm in a crisis situation...

...I need you to marshal your powers
of concentration, limited as they may be...

Give me the phone.

Hi, Penny, it's Leonard.

Hey, Leonard, what's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

He's calling to ask you a favor.
You might be confused...

...because he didn't use the words "Penny,"
"Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

Okay. Enough chitchat.

Okay, step one: Locate your emergency key
to our apartment.

Step two: Enter our apartment.
Step three...

Enter my bedroom.

SHELDON: Step four...
- Yeah, hang on, getting another call.

No!

Let me tell you something. Personal
robots cannot get here soon enough.

And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

...that's Venus.

That is so cool.

You know a lot about space.

Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly,
you were actually in space.

You're not one of those guys
who believe that?

You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
No.

Those are crazy people.

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

Howard, be a dear
and get me another one of these.

Now him, he's one of those geeks.

All right, now before you enter
my bedroom unescorted...

...I need you to understand
that this one time grant of access...

...does not create a permanent easement.

Easement.

It's a legal right of access. Good grief.

What? No, don't put me on hold. I...
Oh...

HOWARD:
Do you believe him?

Normally around women,
he has the personality of a boiled potato.

Put one beer in him,
and he's M. Knight Charmalarmalon.

Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

- What?
- Look at it.

Non-alcoholic beer.

- Then what's going on?
- I don't know.

Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

Placebo, you say.

Interesting.

Yes, I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

Now, what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box...

...located between a Hoberman Sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

Hoberman Sphere.

It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.

No, the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock. My God.

Actually, in India,
the names of constellations are different.

Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

You're making that up.

You got me.

Now, what are you going to do with me?

- Raj. Look.
- Yes?

- What am I looking at?
- You tell me.

Non-alcoholic beer.

Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

Okay, I got a box, but there's no key
in here. Just letters.

That's the wrong box. Put it back.

Oh, Sheldon, are these letters
from your grandmother?

Don't read those letters.

Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie.
That is so cute.

[SHRIEKING]
Put down the letters!

Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

Delightful. I don't know
what you're doing right now...

...but there are little bubbles forming
in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.

Okay. Yeah, I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

Thank you.

- I'm back.
- What up, Moon Pie?

No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.

Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

And then I picked you up
by your ankles...

...and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

I mean, I tried to stick them back on,
but before I could...

...you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

What do you think that means?

I really don't know.

I'll give you a little clue.

My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

Is that so?

Did you know the word pumpernickel comes
from the German words pumper and knickel.

Which loosely translates to fart goblin?

No. I didn't.

Okay, I found the box. Now what?

You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes 10 precise moves to open.

Okay, first locate the
panel with the diamond pattern...

...and slide the center portion
1 millimeter to the left.

Then, on the opposite end of the box...

...slide the entire panel
down 2 millimeters.

You'll hear a slight click.

Hang on. Sheldon, do you have
any emotional attachment to this box?

No. It's a novelty I ordered off the Internet.
Did you hear the click?

Not yet.

There it is.

Okay, here's another one.

If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter...

...you'd be Summer Winter.

- Uh-huh.
- Yep.

Okay, I'm gonna just go for broke here
and say I like you.

Yeah?

So here's my question:

Do you see any conversational path that
would take us from where we are now...

...to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

No.

Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

Thank you.

But before I go...

...would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

Sure.

Okay. Great.

Can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

Okay, now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

She calls me Moon Pie
because I'm nummy-nummy...

...and she could just eat me up.

Now please put the flash drive
in the USB port.

The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

- Hey, how'd it go?
- Terminator broke my phone.

Excuse me.

Okay, I'll be honest with you.

I've spent the last two hours imagining
various scenarios in my head...

...trying to come up with some line
to say to you...

...but then I finally realized
you're a human being, I'm a human being.

I could just say...

CONDUCTOR [ON PA]:
Next stop, Santa Barbara.

I'm sorry. This is me.

"Hi, my name's Leonard."

So I'm thinking you won the Nobel Prize,
what, three years ago...

...so you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

My thought is we continue my research
as a team, you know...

...Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical...

...and when we win the Nobel Prize,
you'll be back on top.

With all due respect, Dr. Cooper,
are you on crack?

Fine. Smoot-Cooper.

Wow, what a diva.

[English - US - SDH]

Knight to Queen's Bishop 5.

Ah. Very nice. What's Leonard gonna do?

Does he give up the pawn
or give up the position?

Mm. Let's find out. Leonard, ready?

Ready.

Go.

[HUMMING IN UNISON
KHACHATURIAN'S "SABRE DANCE"]

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

Damn it. I slipped.

Too bad. You know the rules
of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.

Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.

Despite my deep love of chess,
lasers and aerosol disinfectant...

...I must forfeit.

- Why?
- Because it's almost 11:00.

- So?
- So Penny has a...

..."Don't knock on my door before 11:00
or I punch you in the throat" rule.

[DOOR CLOSES]

ALL:
Ah.

Hey, you know
what would be a great idea?

We get some girls over here
and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.

Believe me, any girl willing to play that,
you don't wanna see naked.

You underestimate me.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

Hey, Sheldon.

- It's 11 a.m.
- I know. You're safe.

This package came
while you were at work.

Great, my rhinestones. Thank you.

- Excuse me.
- What?

You have to sign this.

What is it?

When I signed for the package, I was
deputized by the United Parcel Service...

...and entrusted with its final delivery.
I need you to acknowledge receipt...

...so that I'm fully indemnified
and no longer liable.

Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.

Contents are irrelevant.
A legal bailment has been created.

Does that mean nothing to you?

It means nothing to anybody.

- Let me show you what I'm doing.
- Bailment...

...describes a relationship
in common law...

...where a physical possession
of personal property, or chattels...

...is transferred from one person, the bailer,
to another person, the bailee.

Yeah, yeah. Look, look.
I started a business.

Obviously not a cleaning business.

No. I'm making flower barrettes. See?

I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one
for myself. All the girls at work wanted one.

I showed some to this lady who
runs a shop. She sells cards and jewelry.

She wanted to sell them, I said okay,
and in one week, I made a $156.

Good for you. Sign here.

Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off,
I won't have to be a waitress anymore.

But then who will bring me
my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

Another waitress?

- What's her name?
- I don't know.

And you're going to let her
handle my food?

Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

I think you're just making that up.

Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger,
okay? I just don't wanna be a waitress.

Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

- Fine. Cheeseburger.
- Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

So, what do you think?
I mean, this could be a business, right?

- How many of these can you make a day?
- Mm. About 20.

And how much profit do you make
per Penny Blossom?

- I don't know. Like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
- No, of course you're not. All right.

Ten dollars a day times five days a week
times 52 weeks a year is $2600.

- That's all?
- Before taxes.

Well, I don't have to pay taxes
on this stuff.

The Internal Revenue Service
would strongly disagree.

But if you took advantage
of modern marketing techniques...

...and optimized
your manufacturing process...

...you might make this a viable business.

And you know about that stuff?

Penny.

I'm a physicist.

I have a working knowledge of the entire
universe and everything it contains.

Who's Radiohead?

I have a working knowledge
of the important things in the universe.

- Good luck.
- Sheldon, hold on.

Could you maybe show me
how to make more money with this?

Of course I could.

Sheldon, wait.

Will you?

Just to be clear here.

You're asking for my assistance.

Yes.

And you understand that will involve me
telling you what to do?

I understand.

And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

Okay.

Good.

Let's begin with the premise that everything
you've done up to this point is wrong.

- Oh, imagine that.
- Sarcasm. Goodbye.

No, I'm sorry. Wait. Please, come back.

- There. Done.
- All right.

Twelve minutes and 17 seconds.

Oh, pretty good, right?

That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price...

...you'll effectively be paying yourself
$5. 19 a day.

A day?

There are children in a sneaker factory
in Indonesia who out-earn you.

That just can't be right.

- You're questioning my math?
- No, sorry.

- Would you like me to show my work?
- God, no, no.

- Just please tell me what to do about it.
- All right.

Are you familiar with the development
that resulted from HonorÃ© Blanc's...

...1778 use of interchangeable parts?

The assembly line, of course.

Okay, if I'm not allowed to be snide,
you're not allowed to be condescending.

That wasn't a part of our original agreement
and I do not agree to it now.

How are we supposed to set up machines
and conveyor belts in my apartment?

You're thinking of
the moving assembly line.

An understandable,
but not excusable, mistake. Now...

...the moving assembly line, that was
introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

That innovation is what made possible
our modern consumer culture...

...by enabling a low unit cost
for manufactured goods.

I guess that isn't one of the topics
discussed on your Radiohead.

We're gonna miss the coming attractions.

[GROANS]

What's the matter?

I think I bruised a testicle
capturing that last pawn.

[PENNY & SHELDON SINGING
"BLOW THE MAN DOWN"]

PENNY & SHELDON [SINGING]:
Give me some time to blow the man down

I'm a deep-water sailor
Just come from Hong Kong

BOTH:
To me way, hey, blow the man down

If you give me some whiskey
I'll sing you a song

Give me some time
To blow the man down

Hello?

[IN UNISON]
Hello.

Come quickly, lay aft
To the break of the poop

To me way, hey
Blow the man down

Or I'll help you along
With the toe of my boot

PENNY & SHELDON:
Give me some time to blow the man down

What's going on?

I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.

It's a rhythmic work song
to increase productivity.

Yeah. It's crazy, but it works.

Look, we made this Penny Blossom
in under three minutes.

Terrific, but that kind of raises
more questions than it answers.

Penny's making hair accessories.

I'm helping her optimize
her manufacturing process.

All right, break's over.

[SINGING] Pay attention to orders
Now you one and all

- What are you using as a bonding agent?
- Hot glue.

You're kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates
would do a better job.

- Won't work. The flower's porous.
- What if we infused the bottom layer...

...with silicone RTV
to provide a better mounting surface?

Intriguing.

What are your marketing
and distribution channels?

The waitresses at my work,
and this cute shop...

Hush, hush, hush. Virtually nonexistent.

I'm thinking that we set her up with a
hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.

Eliminate the middle man.

A small server farm
with a static IP in her bedroom.

- She'll need some kind of cooling system.
- Of course.

But before we set up
a marketing infrastructure...

...we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

She has a terrible problem
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

Yeah, it's a bitch.

Ah, I've seen this before.

- Where?
- It's a common stripper problem.

They dance, they sweat, they clump.

Ew.

Thinking about adding a desiccant
like calcium sulfate?

Actually, I'm thinking
about this one stripper named Vega.

But, sure, calcium sulfate could work.

Let's think out of the box for a moment.

How about a molecular sieve?

HOWARD & LEONARD:
Oh.

I've got a spaghetti strainer
in the kitchen.

Wow.

Hey, we could liberate some
microporous charcoal from the chem lab.

Oh, great.

Raj, why don't you go get the charcoal?

Leonard, start working
on some preliminary website designs.

I'll make space in our apartment so we
can move the manufacturing process.

- Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
- It's not my apartment.

Wait, wait, what am I gonna do?

Hey, it's your business.
Do whatever you want.

Oh.

Okay. Cool.

I'm gonna take a nap.

I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this
will give the general idea of the website.

So, what do you guys think?

No, pretty much any way I say that
is gonna hurt his feelings.

Okay, what's wrong with it?

- What's wrong with it?
- Not you. I wasn't asking you.

- Penny?
- Well, it's a little juvenile.

I mean, it kind of looks like
the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

No, it doesn't.

Please. Dateline could use it
to attract predators.

Penny, this is your enterprise,
so it's ultimately your decision.

But based on the quality of his work,
I'd strongly recommend...

...that we let Leonard go.

You wanna fire me?

What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

Penny?

Excuse me, if I did such a bad job,
then why do we already have orders?

- We do?
- Uh-huh. Look.

Mrs. Fiona Fondell from
Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.

- No kidding. Two?
- Uh-huh. Look at the comments.

"Thank you, Penny Blossoms.
These'll be perfect to cover my bald spots."

Aw.

Yeah. That is so sweet.

Camouflaging bald spots.
That's primarily a male concern.

Perhaps we could expand our market.

How are flower barrettes
gonna appeal to men?

- We add Bluetooth.
- Oh.

- Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
PENNY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

You wanna make a hair barrette
with Bluetooth?

Penny, everything is better
with Bluetooth.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

Holy crap. Someone just ordered
1000 Penny Blossoms.

Get out! Who needs 1000
sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?

"The fifth annual East Rutherford,
New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual...

...and Transgender Alliance Luau."

Oh, another market to expand into.
Balding gay men.

And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

We should get to work.

Wait, wait, why does it say
"one-day rush"?

Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

Amazon offers one-day rush.

Yeah, but they don't have to glue
the books together.

How are we gonna make
1000 Penny Blossoms in one day?

Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing.
I'm just web design.

I have to call them and cancel that order.

Excuse me, but was this not your goal?

Financial independence through
entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

Yeah, my brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

I just don't see how we can pull this off.

Okay, that, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt...

...that is not the American spirit.

Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

They didn't quit. They were massacred...

...by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.

All right, let me put it this way.
Your gross receipts on this one order...

...will be over $3000
for one night's work.

You guys get started.

- What are you doing?
- Going online to buy shoes.

[SINGING]
She'll be coming 'round the mountain

- When she comes
- When she comes

She'll be coming 'round the mountain
When she comes

PENNY:
When she comes

SHELDON:
She'll be coming 'round the mountain

BOTH:
She'll be coming 'round the mountain

If I wanted to spend
my Saturday nights doing this...

...I could have stayed in India.

Oh, stop with the fake third-world crap.

Your father's a gynecologist
and you had a house full of servants.

We only had four servants.
And two of them were children.

How are we doing?

We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms
ready to ship.

God, we're never gonna finish in time.

- Hold.
RAJESH: Who made Sheldon the boss?

I believe I'm hearing some negativity
on the factory floor.

- So?
- The labor force is a living organism...

...that must be nurtured.

Any counterproductive grumbling
must be skillfully headed off...

...by management. Observe. Hey!

Less talk, more work.

- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

You hear any union talk,
you let me know.

[SINGING WHILE YAWNING]
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah

[WHISPERING]

[SINGING]
Someone's in the kitchen I know

Ho, ho, ho

[SINGING]
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah

Sheldon. Sheldon.

[SINGING]
'Cause I sold my soul

To the company store

- Honey, do you want some coffee?
- No, I don't drink coffee.

If you don't stay awake,
we'll never finish.

I'm sorry. Coffee is out of the question.

When I moved to California, I promised my
mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

Leonard, help.

Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

I have faith that you will make them.
Good night.

- Leonard.
- Yeah... No.

But, Sheldon, without your insight and
leadership, this enterprise will surely fail.

You're right, of course.

Here, this will help.

Very well.

But if this leads to opiates
or hallucinogenics...

...you're gonna have to answer
to my mother.

Look at Planck's constant.
People say that's arbitrary.

That could not be less arbitrary.
If it varied even slightly...

...life as we know it would not exist. Bam!

Now, now, let's reconsider the entire
argument but with entropy reversed...

...and effect preceding cause.

So you are thinking of a universe.
It's not expanding from the center, no.

It is retreating
from a possibility space. Bam!

This is a space where we are all essentially
Alice standing in front of the Red Queen...

...and we're being offered a cracker
to quench our thirst.

Bam!

In another universe,
let's call that Universe Prime...

- ...there's another Sheldon...
- We should have let him go to bed.

Bam.

I can't believe we actually did it.

One thousand frigging Penny Blossoms.

I just want you guys to know
I am really grateful for your help...

...and for every dollar I make,
I'm gonna give you 20 cents.

That's your entire profit margin.

Oh. Then never mind.

I'll print out the shipping label.

Uh-oh.

What?

We got an email from the East Rutherford,
New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual...

...and Transgender Alliance.

They want another 1000 Penny Blossoms.

- Really?
- One-day rush.

I really need to take that off the website.

Okay, well, guess we better get started.

You can't be serious.

But, come on. What about
the living organism of the work force...

...and the American spirit?

And Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?

Davy Crockett.
Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.

Yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired
and I've had 18 cups of coffee.

The point is, if we all just pull together,
we can do this. Who's with me?

Penny, although you may find it hard
to believe, we do have lives.

Leonard?

Sorry.

My apologies to the gay community
of East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Zoom, zoom, zoom!

Where's the coffee?

We're all out.

No problem.

I'll be back before this banana hits
the ground.

Zoom, zoom, zoom.

[HUMMING IN UNISON
KHACHATURIAN'S "SABRE DANCE"]

Yes!

Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent
Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.

[English - US - SDH]

Okay, it's done.

Look, guys, for the future,
I don't mind killing the big spiders...

...but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

Penny, please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

- Sheldon, it's not that bad.
- Not bad? It's horrible.

You hear stories about this sort of thing.
You never think it will happen to you.

So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

New topic, please.

All right, Penny.
Let me take this opportunity to point out...

...that you are looking particularly
ravishing today.

Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

So there is a number.

Okay. New topic, please.

Hey, did you hear the people
in 5-A are moving out?

- No. Shh-shh-shh!
- Why?

- The people upstairs are moving out.
- No.

The horror.

Why would you just say something
like that?

- How else...?
- No, no, no.

How else was I supposed to say it?

Slowly. Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

You let the bag sit in the water
a while.

The horror.

- Sheldon, I'm sure it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

Okay, did you even know the people
that are moving out?

I never met them.

That's what made them perfect.

There were no awkward hellos
in the halls.

There's no clickety-clacking
of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors.

They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape.

And without that annoying
ammonia-urine smell.

I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

An opera singer, the cast of Stomp.

Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

Why are you making it worse?

I tried making it better,
he wouldn't go for it.

[INAUDIBLE]

- You're right. That's a great idea.
- What?

I'll take the apartment.
I can finally get away from my mother...

...and we can all spend
some more time together.

If you catch my drift.

The horror.

Hold on.

Do you honestly expect me to believe
social protocol dictates...

...we break our backs helping Wolowitz
move, and he only need buy us a pizza?

I'm sorry, that really is how it works.

You're tricking me.

- Tell me the truth, what do we get?
- Ha.

Raj, help me out here.

You get to choose
between a mountain bike or a PS3.

I knew it.

- PS3, definitely PS3.
- Mm-hm.

Who would pick a mountain bike?

HOWARD: Enough with the guilt, Ma.
We'll still see each other.

I'll come over every night
and have dinner with you.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
The hell you will!

What am I running here,
a fancy restaurant?

Does this look like Olive Garden?

HOWARD:
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

You don't wanna see
your little bird leave the nest.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Little bird? You're almost 30!

Fly for God's sake.

HOWARD:
Fine, I'll stay. You happy, crazy lady?

I sure as hell hope so,
because you're ruining my life!

[DOOR SLAMS]

Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news,
you can take your head out of the oven.

I guess I won't be needing this.

Oh, no.

The new ones.

[IN SINGSONG VOICE]
They're here.

Stay calm.
We don't know anything about them yet.

[OBJECTS RATTLING]

- What are you doing?
- I'm checking for musical instruments.

Does that sound like castanets to you?

The box says "kitchen."

So? Do cocaine smugglers
write "cocaine" on the box?

- Hello?
- Hello.

- Hello.
- Hello.

I'm Alicia. I'm moving in upstairs.

That is so great.

Oh, I'm Leonard. I live downstairs.

Upstairs from here, but under you.

Not under you per se...

...but under your apartment. Heh-heh.

- That's nice.
- Yeah, it is.

Well, that concludes your faltering attempt
to mate.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Hello.

On a scale of one to ten, how light
of foot would you describe yourself...

...with one being not cat-like at all,
and ten being freakishly feline?

Freakishly feline?

Is that your answer
or do you not understand the question?

- We'll come back to that one.
- Sheldon.

Hang on. Are you now or have you ever
been a salsa, Irish-folk or breakdancer?

- No.
- You're making her uncomfortable.

Did...? Oh, I'm sorry.

Well, if it helps you feel any better,
you're doing very well so far.

Next question. Are you fertile?

- What?
- I'm trying to determine...

...whether crying infants are a possibility.

- I have no immediate plans.
- If that changes, let me know.

- And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
- Pro?

- Alicia?
- Yes?

Welcome to the building.

Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.

LEONARD: Thank you so much for
giving me the opportunity to help.

Oh, hey, guys.

- Penny, this is Alicia, our new neighbor.
- Hi.

Hi.

I'm helping.

I can see.

Alicia's non-musical,
childless and pro-rug.

She's still on probation, of course,
but I like her.

Cool T-shirt.

Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this.
I'm going jogging.

- You don't jog.
- I can start.

The more likely explanation for your attire
is that you're out of clean clothes again.

- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Penny.

Please, you look cute.
I'm dressed like a slob today too.

Oh, ha, ha.

LEONARD:
I think you look fantastic.

- This one's a player, huh?
- Oh, yeah, be careful.

- Thanks for the warning.
- Okay.

- I'll see you around.
- See you.

[KEYS JINGLING]

[IN MOCKING VOICE]
"I'm dressed like a slob today too."

Oh, mimicry.

I enjoy mimicry.

I've been working on Admiral Ackbar
from Return of the Jedi.

[LOUDLY]
It's a trap.

You have to imagine me
with a giant squid head.

It's a trap.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Come.

Hey.

Congratulations,
I see you did your laundry.

Well, sort of.

- How does one sort of...?
- I bought new clothes, okay?

- Is Leonard around?
- He's upstairs at Alicia's.

Oh, all right, that's cool, no biggie.

He said he'd help me set up my printer,
but I guess I can wait.

What exactly is he doing there?

In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me...

...he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali
setting up her stereo.

Oh, they're all up there, huh?
Hmm. Typical.

It's axiomatically atypical.

Until recently, they did not know Alicia, and
had no encounters in a previous location.

They never went
to visit the former tenants.

So your characterization of their behavior
as typical is demonstrably fallacious.

Okay, now I see the giant squid head.

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

Oh, great.
Now I have to start all over again.

Yeah, I thought about renting
this apartment...

...but I'm really more of a downtown-loft
kind of guy.

Cool. So are you in a loft now?

Oh, actually I'm living
with a woman in Altadena.

Purely platonic. She's also my maid. Heh.

- Sounds like a sweet deal.
- Well, I won't lie. It's pretty dope.

Hello?

Oh, hey.

Hi. I just wanted to bring you
a housewarming gift.

That is so sweet.

- Come on in. Let's open it.
- Great.

- Nice dress.
- Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.

The guys have been helping me
set up my sound system.

I've never had
such good-looking technical support.

Oh, pish posh.

[INAUDIBLE]

I don't know. It means shucks.

Shucks means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.

Penny,
you wanna hear something awesome?

- Yeah.
- Alicia is an actress just like you.

That is so awesome.

- Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.
- I know, tell me about it.

I've been here three months.
All I've gotten is a couple commercials.

And this recurring thing on a soap.

That's why I work at The Cheesecake
Factory. I'm holding out for the right part.

Alicia, what do you want as your default
setting for DVDs, 5. 1 Dolby or DTS?

Whatever you think is best, cutie.

[GIGGLES]

Well, DTS has more low-end...

...so okay.

Hey, guys, you will really appreciate this.
I read the best science joke on the Internet.

Alicia, you won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

Anyway, so this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week...

...orders an ice cream sundae
for himself...

...and offers one to the empty stool
next to him.

This goes on until the owner
asks him what he's doing.

The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist...

...and quantum mechanics teaches us...

...that it is possible
for the matter above this stool...

...to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman...

...who might accept my offer
and fall in love."

The owner then says,
"Lots of women come in here every day.

Why don't you buy an ice cream for them,
and they might fall in love?"

And the physicist says:

"Yeah, but what are
the odds of that happening?" Ha.

That's a little insulting, don't you think?

How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.

Hey, Leonard?

If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?

Oh, yeah, I'd love to.

When you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.

You know, like you promised,
a week ago?

Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

Hello, there.

[MUSIC PLAYS OVER TV]

[MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY
OVER TV]

Who is it?

Oh, hello, Penny. It's open. Come in.

Sarcasm.

- Well, they're all still up there.
- You think I can't hear them?

Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

It's Wolowitz in his stacked heels
that fool no one.

I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

All right, I cared enough to memorize
that stupid joke, but that's all I care.

You know, Penny...

...there's something that occurs in beehives
you might find interesting.

Occasionally, a new queen will arrive
while the old queen is still in power.

When this happens, the old queen
must either locate to a new hive...

...or engage in a battle to the death
until only one queen remains.

What are you saying?
That I'm threatened by Alicia?

That I'm like the old queen of the hive,
and it's just time for me to go?

I'm just talking about bees.

They're on The Discovery Channel.

What are you talking about?

Bees.

[GASPS]

I just got that physicist joke.

- Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
PENNY: Mm-hm.

- Yeah, what's the occasion?
- No occasion.

Just felt like getting some Chinese chow
for my peeps.

Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced not shredded?

Even though the menu
specifies shredded?

Brown rice, not white? Stop at the grocery
and get the mustard?

Pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

Good.

See how it's done, Leonard?

What do we got going on tonight?

Playing Halo? Watching Battlestar?
Drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?

You wanna watch Battlestar?

What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

No, no, PMS is different.

Thank God you're home. I need help.

- What's wrong?
- I got a callback to audition for CSI...

- ...to play a hooker who gets killed.
- Oh, I'd watch that.

But my car is in the shop
and I have to be at Universal in 45 minutes.

- Okay, well, I'll take you.
ALICIA: Oh, you're a lifesaver.

- I'll run lines with you in the car.
ALICIA: Great.

And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

- Actually, that's okay. We already have...
LEONARD: I'm starving.

[DOOR CLOSES]

...Chinese food right here.

They're gone, Penny.
They can't hear you.

I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

Anything she wants,
they go panting after her like trained dogs.

Just last week, she had Howard
drive to her uncle's house...

...in Orange County to pick up her TV?

You once had Leonard and me
get your television from your ex-boyfriend.

Apples and oranges here, Sheldon.

I'm telling you, that girl is a user,
skating through life on her looks...

...taking advantage of innocent men...

...getting auditions
for stupid network shows.

It just creams my corn.

- May I interject something here?
- Please.

You got the wrong mustard.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Guess what? I got the part on CSI.

Oh, boy.

Something wrong?

No, no, no.
You know what? Congratulations.

I think you'll make a great hooker.

Thank you.

Hey, I gotta ask you something.

How much do physicists make?

Um... Ah.

I don't know. I don't think a lot.

Yeah, that's what I figured.

Well, gotta run.

The guys promised to set up
my satellite dish and paint my bedroom.

Yay.

Hey. Hey, can I talk to you about that
for a second?

About what?

Well, you know,
it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj...

...they aren't like other guys.

They're special.

Okay, they're special, and...?

Let's see. How can I explain this?

- They don't know how to use their shields.
- Shields?

Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek when
you're in battle and you raise the shields?

Where the hell did that come from?

Anyways,
you know how guys like this are.

So please don't take advantage of them.

Who says I'm taking advantage of them?

Come on, they're doing everything for you
because you're leading them on.

So I let them do stuff for me.

They're happy, I get stuff.

Who cares? And how is it
any different from what you do?

Excuse me?

I've seen you around them.

Are you pretending
like you don't do the exact same thing?

Okay, lady, you are way out of line.

- Oh, I'm out of line?
- Yeah, you're out of line.

Well, what are you gonna do about it,
bitch?

I like Green Lantern.

I'm just saying it's pretty lame
that he can be defeated by the color yellow.

Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

Golden-age Green Lantern
was vulnerable to wood.

Great, so I can take them both out
with a number-two pencil?

[PENNY AND ALICIA SCREAMING]

Oh, my God. Girl fight!

What are you doing?

I know you.
You're stupid enough to break it up.

May I say you look very comely tonight?

Thank you.

You're right. This filly's been broken.

[MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC
PLAYING ON STEREO]

You set it on DTS, didn't you?

I had to. She called me cutie.

According to Alicia's Facebook page...

...she's hooking up
with one of the producers on CSI.

Well, dead whore on TV,
live one in real life.

[BED CREAKING]

Oh, great.

Now she's jumping up and down
on the bed.

[MOUTHS]
Wow.

[English - US - SDH]

[GROANS]

[CONTINUES GROANING]

Problem?

- This is Thai food.
- Here we go.

We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

Yes, but we all agreed
the third Thursday of every month...

...would be
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

The news didn't reach
my digestive system which, when startled...

...has its own version
of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

The whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday...

...is to get out of this rut
we've been in.

Rut? I think you mean consistency.

And if we're going to abandon that,
why even call it Thursday?

Let's call it "Quonko Day" and divide it
into 29 hours of 17 minutes a piece...

...and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat
to the mighty god Ra.

I could go for some goat.

Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something
different tonight.

All right. Let's go
to the comic book store.

We went to the comic book store
last night.

Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic-book night.

We'll be going on Thursday because
it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Way to think outside but pressed right up
against the box, Sheldon.

What are we gonna do tonight?

If I may proffer a suggestion...

...in bars all across this great nation
of ours, Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

As the evening progresses,
we will get better-looking...

...courtesy of 99-cent margaritas
and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking
up girls in a bar are practically zero.

Oh. Really?
Are you familiar with the Drake equation?

The one that estimates the odds
of contact with extraterrestrials...

...by calculating the product
of series of fractional values...

...such as stars
with planets likely to develop life?

N equals R times FP times NE times FL
times Fl times FC times L?

Yeah, that one.

You can modify it
to calculate our chances of having sex...

...by changing the formula
to use single women in Los Angeles...

...those who might find us attractive...

...and what I call
The Wolowitz Coefficient.

- The Wolowitz Coefficient?
- Neediness times dress-size squared.

In crunching the numbers, I come up with a
conservative 5812 potential sex partners...

...within a 40-mile radius.

You're joking.

I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

I never joke about math or sex.

Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's bounce, bitches.

Oh, you're right.
It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Let's hit the clubs
and meet hot women.

Here we go. Lock up your daughters.
We're gonna hit it and quit it.

Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

Also a good plan.

But next Anything Can Happen Thursday,
we're going to a bar.

- Oh, absolutely.
- You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies?

We're eventually coming for you.

Fascinating.

- Oh, hey, guys. Where you headed?
- To the comic book store.

You're thinking,
"The comic book store on a Thursday?

Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole
and into a land of madness."

What you have failed to take into account is
that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.

You got me.

Oh, hey, could you pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

No, I think you mean comic books.

Comics are feeble attempts at humor...

...featuring talking babies
and anthropomorphized pets...

...found traditionally
in the optimistically named "funny pages."

Leonard, pick me up comics
for my nephew's birthday?

- Sure. What does he like?
- I don't know, just pick out anything.

Just pick out anything?

Maybe we can pick out a new suit for him
without knowing his size...

...or pick out his career
without knowing his aptitude...

...or pick out a new breakfast cereal
without knowing his fiber requirements...

...or his feelings
about little marshmallows.

Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.

Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man,
Spectacular Spider-Man...

...The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man,
Spider-Man 2099?

- Leonard?
LEONARD: This can go on all night.

Why don't you just come with us?

Ugh. That's what I was trying to avoid.

Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.

Oh, what a cute little store.

Everybody's staring at me.

LEONARD: Don't worry. They're more
scared of you than you are of them.

Unlikely.

Here. What about this one
for my nephew?

- A superb choice.
- Oh, great.

Yeah, provided he has already read
Infinite Crisis and 52...

...and is familiar with the reestablishment
of the DC Multiverse.

Uh, what's a Multiverse?

Get her out of here.

Come on, I'll help you pick something.

That's right. She's with us.

Guys like that are so pathetic.

Tell me about it.

Ooh, look, a new Batman belt buckle.

Oh, hey, Leonard.
I help you find something?

Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny.
She's just looking for some comic books.

Oh, really? Wow. Blink twice
if you're here against your will.

I think we're fine, Stuart.

- Okay. Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

Oh, he seems like a nice guy.

You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

No, no, no. I just meant for... Yeah.

Just because people appreciate comic
books doesn't make them weirdoes.

Stuart's a terrific artist. He went
to the Rhode Island School of Design.

Okay, what about the guy in the superhero
T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?

Oh, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.

He doesn't really help the point
I'm trying to make.

- Got it, got it, got it.
- Got it, got it, got it.

- Need it.
- Need it.

- Let it go, Sheldon.
- Why should I let it go? I saw it first.

- Yes, but I saw it from the front.
- A far less impressive feat.

Oh, come on, I need this
for my Batman collection.

- I need it for my Robin collection.
- Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?

Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.

- You let go.
- No, you.

- Problem?
- Yes. He won't let go of my comic book.

- It's my comic book.
- Leonard, we need a ruling.

Uh, cut it in half?

- Excuse me.
- Oh, hello again.

Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

A 13-year-old girl.

[LAUGHS]

But if you're dead set
on a comic book, try this.

Oh. "Hellblazer. " What's this about?

A morally ambiguous confidence man
who smokes, has lung cancer...

...and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

Well, if that doesn't make me
the favorite aunt, I don't know what will.

Is this me?

Depends. Do you like it?

- Wow, it's really good.
- Yes, that's you.

That's so sweet.
But what if I didn't like it?

It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.

I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

I have got to learn how to draw.

Hey.

Once again, defeated
by your own prurient interests.

Guys, have you seen Stuart all up
in Penny's business over there?

Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

Okay, you've got my number.
Now give me the picture.

All right. You drive a hard bargain...

- ...but here.
- All right. So, um, just give me a call.

So Leonard, how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

Look at that. That's a dent.

Thank you,
Howard "Ham-Fisted" Wolowitz.

Did you shut the TV off
in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

...Star Trek: The Original Series
"Trouble With Tribbles" crossover episode?

Apparently so.

Are you ill?

No.

All right.

Then is it fair to say that you're
experiencing some emotional turmoil...

...over the events involving Penny
earlier this evening?

When did you pick up on that?

A moment ago, you turned off the TV
in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

...Star Trek: The Original Series
"Trouble With Tribbles" crossover episode.

Would you like some advice?

Sure, why not?

Then this is the perfect time
to launch a blog...

...with an interactive comments section.

Gee, thanks a lot.

Would you rather I offer
my personal insight?

No, I don't need any insights.

I just wanna know why Penny's
more interested in Stuart than me.

We're practically the same guy.

Oh, I disagree.

You know, Stuart is taller,
artistic, self-employed...

...and, most significantly,
he gets 45 percent off comic books.

You're right. I really should be asking
strangers on the Internet.

My original point.

Chinese food, vintage video games.

After the nightmare
of Anything Can Happen Thursday...

...this is Friday night
the way it was meant to be.

Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?

Oh, hey, guys.

Hey, Penny and Stuart.

Hey, Stuart.

- Hey, guys.
- So, what are you kids up to?

Stuart has a piece in an art show
that's opening tonight.

And you guys are going together. Great.

It is great. Really great.

It's freaking awesome.

- What are you doing?
- Friday night.

That means Chinese food
and vintage video games?

Vintage doesn't even begin to describe
what we have planned.

Tonight we are playing the classic 1980
interactive text adventure, "Zork."

It's the buggy beta version.

Wow, "Zork."

- Well, you guys have fun.
- Yeah.

STUART: See you, guys.
- See you, Stuart.

- Hey, Howard?
- Yes?

Take me to a bar with women.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Okay.

Let me just go inside
and slip off my underwear.

Why?

HOWARD: Well, if I get lucky, I don't wanna
be caught in my Aquaman briefs.

Do you...? Let's go.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

May I have a grasshopper
with a little umbrella, please?

- No, he may not.
- Why?

I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking
a grasshopper with a little umbrella.

Fine.

I'll have a chocolate martini.

Wrong again.

You know I can't talk to women unless
I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.

There are plenty of bars where you can
order grasshoppers or chocolate martinis...

...but you wouldn't have to
because there are no women in them.

Gotcha.

I'll have a Brandy Alexander.

All right, the Three Musketeers
just became the Dynamic Duo.

- Should we talk to some of these women?
- No, it's way too early in the night for that.

See, first we let the lawyers
and the jocks thin the herd...

...and then we go after the weak
and the old and the lame.

- That's your system?
- That's my system.

Oh, and if you spot a chick
with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.

Oh, come on.

I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants
showed up to your art opening.

Yeah. It would've been nicer
if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

Um, you know, it's kind of early.

Wanna maybe come in for coffee
or something?

Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee,
isn't it?

Oh, you think "coffee" means coffee.
That is so sweet.

Come on, I think I have decaf.

Oh, good, Stuart.
I thought I heard your voice.

- Do you have a moment?
- Uh, yeah, I guess.

We're a little busy here, so...

- What are you doing?
- We're having coffee.

Isn't it a little late for coffee?

It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.

I'll just go look for it.

- What's up?
- Well, I've spent the last three hours...

...in a debate in the DC Comics Batman
chat room, and I need your help.

Oh, yeah. Those guys can be
very stubborn. What's the topic?

I am asserting in the event
that Batman's death proves permanent...

...the original Robin, Dick Grayson,
is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.

Ooh, Sheldon, I'm afraid
you couldn't be more wrong.

"More wrong"?

Wrong is an absolute state
and not subject to gradation.

Of course it is. It's a little wrong
to say a tomato is a vegetable.

It's very wrong to say
it's a suspension bridge.

But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing.

A superhero in his own right.

"Batman Two" has to be the second Robin,
Jason Todd.

"Has to be"? "Has to be"?

I hope you're being
deliberately provocative.

PENNY: I found the decaf.
- Oh, great.

Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.

Barkeep, Alexander me.

How about those two?

No, they're eating peanuts.

With my allergies, one kiss
would put me in Cedars-Sinai for a week.

What about the ones in the corner?

Possible. Very possible.

You want the one in the whiplash collar
or the one who keeps blinking?

- I think Blinky's cute.
- Done, sir.

Wait. So we just go over there?

No. We have a little prep work to do.

Put this in your mouth, we walk past them,
you stumble a bit.

I say, "Sorry,
my friend's had a little too much."

And then I start to pull it
out of your mouth and say:

"A little too much fun."

[LAUGHS]

Get it? I mean, they're laughing,
we're laughing. Then we get them up...

...to about a 0.15 blood alcohol level
and tell them we're millionaires.

What else you got?

Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap
and pretend to be a ventriloquist's dummy?

No.

I can't sit on your lap.
You don't know the routine.

I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck
in a pre-Zero Hour DC Universe.

Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill
as the killer of Batman's parents...

...effectively deprived him
of his raison d'Ãªtre.

You can throw all the French around
you want, it doesn't make you right.

Au contraire.

Plus, you're forgetting
that the Infinite Crisis story line...

...restored Joe Chill
to the Batman mythology.

I am forgetting nothing,
and I resent your tone.

[SIGHS]

Okay. Look, Sheldon, it's late.
I've gotta get some sleep.

- So I win.
- No, I'm tired.

So I win.

- Fine, you win.
- Darn tooting, I win.

Penny, I really had a terrific time.

Penny?

No, no, no. Don't wake her.

She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.

You know, I don't think that was decaf.

HOWARD:
Wait, is this your card or isn't it?

Trust me, this was their card.

I thought you were good at this.

You're always talking about
how you go to bars and meet women.

I do. All the time.

Well, what happened?
Been sitting here all night...

...and the longest conversation you've had
with a woman was when your mom called.

Wow, you're just gonna make me
come out and say it, aren't you?

Say what?

You're weighing me down.

I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

Fine, I'll sit here.
You take flight and hunt.

Don't be ridiculous.
You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.

Actually, you can.

There's a whole sport built around it.

Falconry.

Shut up.

Let's just get Koothrappali and go.

Lucky bastard.

It's gotta be that stupid accent of his.

[IN INDIAN ACCENT]
Hello, I'm Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Okay, I'm stumped.

[English - US - SDH]

Okay.
Are you from the Star Wars universe?

Yes.

- Were you in the original trilogy?
- Yes.

Is there a picture of you in my wallet
wearing a metal bikini?

God, I hope not.

- No, I'm not Princess Leia.
- Okay, my turn.

Are you in all six Star Wars movies?

- Yes.
- Interesting.

- Are you a droid?
- Yes.

Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?

Yes.

- C-3P0.
- You got it.

That's preposterous.
I do not resemble C-3P0.

Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered,
I just don't see it.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Leslie Winkle. Ahem.

You've reached Friends with Benefits.

For a booty call, press 1 now.

What exactly does that expression mean,
"friends with benefits"?

Does he provide her
with health insurance?

No.

Look, imagine you maintained a friendship
with someone you had sex with...

...but you were free to date
whoever you wanted.

I'm sorry, I can't imagine any of that.

All right, back to the game.

I believe it's my turn.

You may begin your questions
whenever you're ready.

Are you Spock?

I don't like this game.

So where were we?

- Aren't you leaving for your booty call?
- No, it was something else.

Why does everything
have to be about sex with you? Come on.

Whose turn is it?

- We're up to you.
HOWARD: Great.

- Just start.
- Okay, let's see.

Are you from a TV series?

She dumped me.

[CRYING]

I bet he's someone from Babylon 5.
We're never gonna get it.

What happened with Leslie?
Why did she dump you?

I don't know. She just said,
"Howard, Mama's a rolling stone."

Then her call waiting beeped,
and she was gone.

I don't understand.

If you were in a non-emotional
relationship...

...then why are you having
what appears to be an emotional response?

Sheldon,
he obviously had feelings for her.

Of course I had feelings for her.
I saw her naked for God's sake.

Okay, look,
you just need to get your mind off it.

Do you wanna go to the comic-book store,
maybe see a movie?

I don't wanna go anywhere.

You know...

...I'm given to understand
that there's an entire city in Nevada...

...designed specifically to help people
like Howard forget their problems.

We can replace them
with new problems such as alcoholism...

...gambling addiction
and sexually-transmitted diseases.

Is it me or was that Sheldon's way
of saying, "Vegas, baby"?

- I've never been there, have you?
- Me? No.

I just got "Vegas, baby!"
from Vince Vaughn in Swingers.

That could be fun, and I know
my weekend's wide open now that...

[SIGHS]

Okay, let's do this. Let's go to Las Vegas.

Now? Right now?

Why not?
People do things right now all the time.

Why can't we be "right now" people too?

Go home, pack a bag,
and we'll be "right now" people.

I have to stop at the drugstore
to refill a prescription...

...but after that, we'll go right now.

- What do you say, Howard?
- I say, Vegas, baby.

- What are you gonna tell your mother?
- SeaWorld, baby.

Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?

I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs
and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.

Great, we'll bring you back a T-shirt.

SHELDON:
Thank you.

Hello, neighbor.

Hello, Sheldon.

And how are you this fine evening?

- Great.
- Good, I'm glad.

PENNY:
Really? Are you drunk?

I'm just in a good mood.

While my compatriots are in Las Vegas...

...I will be enjoying a blissful evening
in my personal Fortress of Solitude.

That's Superman's big ice thingy, right?

You know, I'm in such a good mood,
I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp...

...of the English language
folksy and charming today.

Mmm. What smells so good?

That is the intoxicating aroma
of Kadhai Paneer.

A perfect culinary representation
of the freedom this evening holds.

Not only is it Indian cuisine,
which Koothrappali loathes...

...it contains a generous helping
of peanuts...

...which would reduce Wolowitz
to a wheezing 97-pound blister.

And finally,
its main ingredient is paneer...

...a farmer's cheese that would cause
Leonard to render any room...

...uninhabitable within minutes.

Yum.

- Well, enjoy your big evening.
- Penny?

I realize you're also on your own tonight.

So if at some point
you find yourself with nothing to do...

...please do not disturb me.

- Have fun, Sheldon.
- Oh, I shall.

[HUMMING "SUPERMAN" THEME SONG]

No!

What's wrong, Superman?
Locked out of your big ice thingy?

Look at this.

Mouthwash, lotion, body wash,
shampoo and conditioner...

...together in one tiny bottle.

I love Las Vegas.

Hey, Howard,
can I borrow some aftershave?

Black case, top compartment.

That's a lot of cologne.

HOWARD:
First row are your musks.

Second is woods, leathers and botanicals.

Third is assorted pheromones.
Tread lightly.

That's the spirit, Howard.

Yes, we can.

Come on, let's go.

You guys go ahead.
I just have to finish up an e-mail.

That's not an e-mail,
that's Leslie's Facebook page.

Okay, fine.
I'm checking her Facebook page.

Look at her status update.

She's saying she dumped me.
People need to know I dumped her.

But she did dump you.

Grow up, Raj.
There's no place for truth on the Internet.

Just go. I'll catch up with you.

All right.

We should have a plan
in case one of us gets lucky.

Okay, uh...

If I get lucky, I'll take her to my stately
manor outside Gotham City...

...and if you get lucky,
I'll sleep on the moon.

Sounds like a plan.

Hang on, I think the emergency key
is around here somewhere.

We have a bowl.

Our keys go in a bowl.

You should get a bowl.

So how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon
Cooper forget his key in the first place?

I left them in the bowl.

Uh-oh. I remembered
where the emergency key is.

- Where?
- In your apartment.

What's it doing in my apartment?

I went in there a few weeks ago,
and you guys weren't home, and I forgot it.

You went in my...? Why would...?
What are you saying?

Not a big deal.
I was making coffee and ran out of milk.

You're the milk thief.

Leonard said I was crazy,
but I knew that carton felt lighter.

All right, Sheldon, calm down.
I'll call the building manager.

He'll come open your door.
Just eat here while you're waiting.

Eat my dinner in your apartment?

- Yeah, why not?
- Sure, why not?

And after the sun's down,
we can all pile in my pickup...

...and go skinny-dipping
down at the crick.

Because today's the day
that stopped making sense.

- Thanks.
- I'm telling you, Leonard.

Video slots, free drinks brought to us
by a bosomy barmaid...

...and all-you-can-eat shrimp for 3.95?

Disneyland can suck it.

This is the real happiest place on Earth.

[COINS JINGLING]

Dude, check it out.
That's laundry for a month.

Hi.

Hello.

- What's your name?
- Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

Hello, Rajesh Ram...

Hi, Rajesh.

- I'm Mikayla.
- Hello, Mikayla.

So are you interested in a little party?

Oh, my, yes. I love to party.

"Party" is my middle name.

Or it would be if it weren't "Ramayan."

- Uh, Raj, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Not now, Leonard...

...Mikayla's inviting me to a party.

You'd better call the moon
and make sure they have a bed for you.

Yeah, I really need to talk to you.

Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere. Don't move.

Just stay the beautiful unspoiled
American flower that you are.

What's wrong with you, dude?
That woman is all up on my jammy.

Okay, I hate to break this to you
and whatever your jammy is...

...but I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.

What?

- No.
- Okay, let me put it this way.

In your entire life, how many gorgeous
women have walked up to you at a bar...

...and asked if you wanted to party?

Maybe I can save her.

Maybe. But I'm guessing it'll cost you
about $500 an hour to try.

It was lovely meeting you.
Best of luck in your future endeavors.

Whatever.

Oh, I miss her already.

[CELL PHONE BEEPS]

Oh, Howard's losing it.

Check out his latest Twitters.

"I'm at the bottom of a black hole
staring into the abyss.

My life is meaningless.
My future is without hope."

Why don't we take him
to see the Blue Man Group?

You think that'd help?

USA Today calls them
"Exuberant fun for the whole family."

I don't know. Howard isn't really
the "family fun" kind of guy.

It's too bad he wasn't here
for that hooker.

She's exactly his type:

A hooker.

You know, I bet if we hired her,
that would cheer him up.

We're not going to get
Wolowitz a hooker.

[CELL PHONE BEEPS]

"I'm so lonely and horny...

...I may open this $20 jar of peanuts
and end it all."

I suppose it wouldn't hurt
to get an estimate.

So how was your day?

Are you trying to make small talk?

Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.

No, it's the accepted convention.

How was your day?

Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around
at the restaurant, so my hours are different...

I'm sorry, that's not going to
interest me at all. Just eat.

Hello, again.

- Oh, hi.
- Yeah, hi. Listen, um...

...if you're not busy,
we were thinking maybe you could...

- We were wondering...
- If you're really a prostitute.

- You guys cops?
BOTH: No.

I'm a prostitute.

- Okay, great. Um...
- Heh, heh.

The thing is, we've got this friend,
and he's kind of down in the dumps...

...and we thought
maybe you could cheer him up.

With sex.

I think she knows what I meant.

How can she
when you beat around the bush?

She's from the mean streets, where
they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

Don't worry,
I can take good care of your friend.

Okay, terrific. Um...

Listen, is there a way that we can do this
where he doesn't know that you're a...

- You know...
- A prostitute.

You want the girlfriend experience.

Yes, yes. Exactly.
The girlfriend experience.

Actually, if it's not too much to ask...

...could we have
the Jewish girlfriend experience?

Okay, that's question 20.
You have to guess.

I don't know, Sheldon.

Are you Star Wars?

How can one person be a whole movie?

Okay, I give up.
Can we just do something else?

Fine.

I was Spock.

Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

What?

Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

Where did that even come from?

- Did he say we were?
- No, Leonard said nothing.

But who knows what goes on over here when
he pretends your mail was misdelivered?

Just mail, no benefits.

I see.

Why are you asking?

I'm curious about
the whole social construct.

On its face, the idea of satisfying
one's sexual appetite...

Assuming one is afflicted with such.

...without emotional entanglement,
that seems imminently practical.

What I've observed, however,
is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

Well, some people just can't handle
that kind of relationship.

Can you?

Excuse me?

Are you able to have sex with men without
developing an emotional attachment?

Sheldon, I really don't wanna
talk about this with you.

Is this conversation
making you uncomfortable?

Of course it's making me uncomfortable.
Can't you tell?

I really have no idea.

I don't particularly excel
at reading facial expressions...

I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

Thank you, that's very helpful.

All right,
where are these amazing shrimp?

Behold.

Seriously?
You think this is the size of a baby's arm?

A little baby.

I'm going back to the room.

Boy, would it maybe kill them
to put out a nice brisket?

Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

Ester Rosenblatt.

I don't think the manager's coming tonight,
so here.

Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?

Well, it wasn't the first suggestion
that came to mind...

...but it's the one I'm going with.

I can't sleep on your couch.
I sleep in a bed.

Given its dimensions,
I have no intention of living out...

...E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book,
The Tall Man From Cornwall.

What?

There was a tall man from Cornwall
Whose length exceeded his bed

My body fits on it, but barely upon it
There's no room for my big Cornish head

[SIGHS]

All right, I will give you my bed
on one condition.

That you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.

- May I say one last thing?
- Only if it doesn't rhyme.

All right.

Good night.

Turn-ons, let me see.

Reading a good book in front of the fire...

...long walks on the beach...

...and getting freaky on the Sabbath
with a bacon cheeseburger.

Really? Me too.

Oy gevalt, you're hot.

Yeah.

Excuse me for a moment.

- Hey. How's it going?
- Cut the crap. You set this up, didn't you?

- Yes.
- She's a hooker, isn't she?

A prostitute, yes.

- And you already gave her the money?
- Yes.

Thank you.

Penny?

What?

I can't sleep.

Maybe that's because
your hole is still open.

I'm homesick.

Your home is 20 feet from here.

Twenty feet, 20 light years.
It doesn't matter.

It's in a galaxy far, far away.

Damn it.

What do you want me to do?

Sing "Soft Kitty."

That's only for when you're sick.

Homesick is a type of being sick.

Come on, do I really have to?

I suppose we can stay up and talk.

[SINGING]
Soft kitty

Warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty

Um...

Sleepy kitty.

Sleepy kitty...

No.

Start over.

Soft kitty

Warm kitty

Little ball of fur

Happy kitty

Sleepy kitty

Purr, purr, purr

- Penny?
- Yeah?

Thank you for letting me stay here.

Oh. You're welcome, sweetie.

Okay, I'm sleepy now. Get out.

Oh, good, you're finally home.

What were you doing at Penny's?

Well, we had dinner, played some games,
and then I spent the night.

Oh.

You'll be happy to know that I now
have a much better understanding...

...of "friends with benefits."

[English - US - SDH]

[SNIFFS]

Smell that?

That's the smell of new comic books.

Oh, yes.

They're on me today, boys.

You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?

No, I'm celebrating.

As we speak, the space shuttle is docking
at the Internationale Space Station...

...where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

Just think, thanks to your hard work...

...an international crew of astronauts will
boldly go where no man has gone before.

- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

The Star Trek reference
and the play on words...

...involving the double meaning
of "to go"...

...suggest that Leonard is humorously
mocking your efforts in space plumbing.

Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us...

...I'm the only one making any real-world
contribution to science and technology.

He's right. This is an important
achievement for two reasons:

Number one, and of course, number two.

[LAUGHING]

Oh, clever.

Playing on the use of cardinal numbers
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

[LAUGHS]

Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.

It's mind-blowing.

Excuse me, spoiler alert.

But I didn't spoil anything.

You told me it's mind-blowing,
so my mind is going into it pre-blown.

And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

- I'm sorry.
- Said the Grinch to Christmas.

- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure. What's up?

Remember I went out with Penny
a couple weeks ago?

- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember. That was the night...

...you went to the bar and made a fool of
yourself trying to pick up strange women.

What about it?

Well, the thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

Oh. Too bad. You know...

I guess the thing to do now is,
you know, pick yourself up.

Dust yourself off, forget it. Move on.

- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

Because we're going out again tomorrow.

Excuse me, Stuart?

- Have you read the new Flash?
- No.

Well, I have,
and it will knock your socks off.

Good luck getting them back on.

Anyway, I figure this is probably
my last shot with Penny...

- ...and I don't wanna screw it up.
- Oh, nobody wants that.

So here's my question:

It's the second date. You think
she'll be expecting things to get physical?

Oh, gee.

Yeah, my initial reaction is no.

But, you know, let me think about it
and get back to you, okay?

Okay. So you'll give me a call?

- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

Or nobody calls anyone.

Interesting, Penny's current suitor
asking advice from her former suitor.

Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning
my pain, Raj.

You wanna make sure he gets nowhere
with Penny...

...without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

- I'm listening.
- Just tell him...

...to do everything you've done with her
for the last two years.

- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi.

- How's it going?
- Good, good.

- You?
- Fine.

- Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

You know your friend Stuart?

Yes.

Well, he asked me out again
and I said yes.

And then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

- About what?
- Well, does it bother you?

Me going out with one of your friends?

- Because, you know, you and me...
- No. No, that's the past.

I'm really more of a right now
kind of guy.

You know, living in the moment.

Although I do have to live a little
in the future because, well, that's my job.

Of course, my fondness for classic science
fiction does draw my attention backwards...

...but those stories often take place
in the future, so...

In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.

Okay, well, that's really cool of you.

LEONARD:
Yeah? Well, I wouldn't say cool.

I'd just say, "That's Leonard."

Well, in that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

About Stuart?

Love to.

He's very shy. How do I make him
feel more comfortable around me?

Well, first of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

- Really?
- Well, yeah. Stuart thrives under pressure.

That's why he works
in a comic-book store.

[PHONE RINGING]

Oh.

It's Stuart.

[PHONE RINGING]

You're not going to answer it?

He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.

You're making an assumption.

Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.

And he needs your assistance.

Why would he call me?

We don't know.

And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.

[PHONE RINGING]

- Answer the phone, Leonard.
- No.

[PHONE CHIMING]

There. It went to voicemail.

Aren't you going
to check your messages?

- No.
- You have to check your messages.

The leaving of a message
is one half of a social contract...

...which is completed
by the checking of the message.

If that contract breaks down,
then all social contracts break down.

And we descend into anarchy.

It must be hell inside your head.

At times.

Guys, we have a code red.

Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?

Or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

I was going over the schematics
on my Zero-G Toilet...

...and I made a teeny-tiny mistake
on the specifications for the diverter valve.

How teeny-tiny?

It's gonna fail after about 10 flushes.

- But the mission is for six months.
- That's the code red.

It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when...

...but at some point, something way worse
than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.

Have you notified NASA?

You crazy? What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet...

...and pretty soon there's gonna be crap
floating all over your nice space station?

What are you gonna do?

I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

So, what do you need us for?

He can't figure out how to fix it.

You said you were gonna be supportive.

I'm trying. But you have to admit,
this is pretty damn funny.

I agree.

It's a juxtaposition of the nature
of space exploration...

...against the banality of a malfunctioning
toilet that provides the comic fodder here.

[LAUGHS]

Check your messages.

All right, this is an exact duplicate
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity...

...Human Waste Disposal System
as deployed on the Space Station.

Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

Good one, yeah.

[FAKES LAUGH]

It's hilarious. Now.

Here's an approximation of the spare parts
available on the space station.

We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,
to reinforce this.

So the waste material avoids the turbine.

You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?

You know, I have to say I thought the toilet
humor would get less funny with repetition.

Apparently, there is no law of diminishing
comedic returns with space poop.

[KNOCKING]

- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Stuart.

- You busy?
- Uh...

Classified, Leonard.

Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.

- What's up?
- Well, tonight's my date with Penny.

And we haven't been able to connect
by phone...

- Yeah, I'm sorry. It's been broken.
- Or e-mail.

Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.

Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

All right. Well, off the top of my head...

...you know, I think the most important
thing with Penny is to go really slow.

I mean, glacial.

- Okay.
- You know, guys come on to her...

...all the time, so you need to, like,
set yourself apart, you know?

Be a little shy.

And don't make too much eye contact.

And you know, treat her with, like,
cool detachment.

And, you know, fear.

- Fear?
LEONARD: Yeah.

Like you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

Well,
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.

Thanks, Leonard.

What is that thing anyway?

You don't know what this is?

- No.
- Good, get out.

Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very crafty.

It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

...we make Jesus cry.

All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
to reinforce the center cross-support?

No good. I mean, it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans...

...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

I feel terrible.

Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

I deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

Of course you feel terrible. You completely
screwed up your karma, dude.

You don't really believe in that superstition,
do you?

It's not superstition,
it's practically Newtonian.

For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

Leonard pretends to be a friend,
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

Okay, look.

Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here...

...what if we ran another line,
bypassed it entirely?

Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

What if we reposition
the collection tank?

It won't work. No way to mount it.

Here's an idea.
What if I change my name...

...and go live with my cousin
and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

That could work.

- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

- I'm gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
- No. I have coffee.

Great,
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

I really don't wanna talk about it.

Yeah. Right. Sure.

But, you know, the thing is,
before you guys went out...

- ...I spoke to him and I...
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

- Okay, I kind of feel res...
- Look, Leonard.

What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?

If you really want to clean up your karma,
go get my freaking latte.

Hang on, I think I've got this.

Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

- Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
- If you knew what you were doing...

...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

Howard, wait.

Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the filter assembly in place?

Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.

We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera...

...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

- Where you going?
- Comic-book store.

Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

- Me too.
- You can go to the comic book store...

...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

Why does Leonard get to go?

Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

And if I have to hear about it again,
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
HOWARD: I got your back, sister.

All right, I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

- That's heavy.
- Damn right, it's heavy.

It's my mother's meatloaf.

It's been testing toilets for generations.

I must say, Howard...

...I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances...

...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste
disposal test with meatloaf analog.

In three, two, one.

Fascinating.

What do you think the problem is?

Not enough bread crumbs.

- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?

I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

No, your advice was great.

- It was?
- Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

You're kidding.

Never worked for me.

Yeah, last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

I went really slow, I kept my distance...

...and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out.

Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

During the kissing?

What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

No, everything was good and really hot.

And I said, "Oh, Penny"...

...and right where she was supposed
to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said...

...your name.

- Leonard?
- That is your name, right?

Yeah. No, yeah, it is.

Wow, I'm sorry.

That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

Well, it beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

Yeah, it was pretty bad.

No doubt, no doubt.

Okay, well...

- ...I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Not your fault.

Yeah, how about that?

- See you soon.
- Yep, sure.

Yes, I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

What's classified?

Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

I don't see why I have to worry.

My career's not hanging in the balance.

That was a joke.

It's funny because it's true.

Leonard,
could you pass the soy sauce, please?

- I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I said Leonard.

Yes, you did, didn't you?

What the hell is that?

Meatloaf.

What was it doing on the ceiling?

That's classified.

ASTRONAUT [OVER RADIO]:
Houston, Internationale Space Station.

We have a little situation up here.

We'd like to make an unscheduled
space walk.

MAN [OVER RADIO]:
ISS, Houston...

...which crew members
would be involved in this EVA?

ASTRONAUT: Houston, we'd all like
to step outside for a few minutes.

MAN:
ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.

ASTRONAUT:
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.

We are basically out the door.

[English - US - SDH]

Oh, boy.

What?

I can't comment without violating our
agreement that I not criticize your work.

- Then what was "Oh, boy"?
- Great restraint on my part.

There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say "science."

Okay, how's that?

You actually had it right
in the first place.

Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

Buzzinga.

Well, now, here's a peculiar e-mail.

The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

- Why?
- Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8...

...and move my bowels at 8:20.

Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

I guess you'll find out what it is
in the morning.

That's 14 hours away.

For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively
one of Heisenberg's particles.

I know where I am or how fast I'm going,
but I can't know both.

Yet how am I supposed to carry on...

...with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

Yeah, I know the feeling.

Leonard. Leonard.

Leonard.

Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university...

...his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

That entire family is fascinated by what
time it is and whether people know it.

You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

Tell me what my other option was.

You could have waited until morning.

I know, look who I'm talking to.

Remember the grant proposal I submitted
to the National Science Foundation...

...to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic north pole?

Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

Oh, how nice.

Well, a space opened up
at the last minute...

...on the NSF expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

Wait a minute.

[TOILET FLUSHES]

He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

Yes.
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

Okay. Well, do you wanna go?

Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors.

But if I'm able to detect slow-moving
magnetic monopoles there...

...I will be the scientist
who confirmed string theory.

And people will write books about me.

Third graders will create macaroni-art
dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

Sure. Maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

Sarcasm?

Maybe.

I am on the horns of a dilemma.

Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper,
at the North Pole?

Easy peasy. I'm doing it right now.

I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

How often have we had to leave
a movie theater...

...because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

How can you say that? The scientific
opportunity of a lifetime presents itself...

...my best friend says, "Don't go."

- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

How can I possibly go?

What are the words I can say now...

...to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

How was it resolved?

It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

Just imagine. If he says yes...

...we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

We could play outside.

We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

Good news, gentlemen.
I have tentatively accepted...

ALL:
Yeah!

...the invitation
to join the Arctic expedition.

- It's not gonna be the same without you.
- We're gonna miss you.

Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

Oh, I don't like where this is going.

I would like to propose...

...that the three of you
accompany me.

- To the North Pole?
- Yes.

Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

I'll admit that was a concern.

But the fact is, I'll need a support team
and the three of you are my first choice.

- Really?
- Others might be more qualified...

...but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking...

...so why don't you take a few moments
to discuss it?

We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

SHELDON:
I'm still within earshot.

You may wanna wait
for my door to close.

[DOOR CLOSES]

We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

I don't know
how we can turn it down.

Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition," say:

"No, we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle...

...with an anal nutbag."

But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory...

...we could drink for free in any bar,
in any college town...

...with a university
that has a strong science program.

Howard, this is big science.
You could be the engineer...

...who builds the equipment
that puts us on the cover of magazines.

I could also be the engineer who builds
the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

You still might get on a magazine.

- You guys are seriously considering this?
- Yes.

- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

My religion teaches that if we suffer
in this life, we are rewarded in the next.

Three months at the North Pole
with Sheldon...

...and I'm reborn
as a well-hung billionaire with wings.

Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

- I'm in.
- Me too.

Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

Excellent. And just an FYI,
as I am the expedition's team leader...

...protocol dictates that be phrased,
"Fine, sir."

But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

Pssh!

Penny?

[KNOCKING]

PENNY:
Sheldon?

- Penny?
[KNOCKING] Sheldon?

- Penny.
[KNOCKING] Sheldon.

Penny!

- What do you want?
- I need access...

...to the Cheesecake Factory's
walk-in freezer.

Honey, I already told you...

...the hamburger meat is fresh
and stored at a safe temperature.

No, this is to train for a three-month
expedition to the magnetic north pole.

What?

I don't know how that sentence
could possibly confuse you...

...but to elaborate,
I am going to the Arctic Circle...

...with Leonard, Wolowitz,
and Koothrappali.

- You're all going?
- Yes.

- For three months?
- Yes.

Excuse me.

Wait, is that a yes or a no
on the freezer?

That woman has the attention span
of a gnat.

Hey, Leonard. Sheldon says
you're going to the North Pole.

Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah, I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

Well, it all happened kind of fast.

And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear...

...and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

- Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

There's no reason you have to tell me.
I was just surprised.

You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

Now, where do we stand
on the freezer?

Is he serious?

Actually, it would help.

All right, I'll see what I can do.

So, wow, three months
at the North Pole.

- Wow, that is awesome.
- Yeah.

Sorry but at what point do you put this
"see what you can do" plan into action?

Just a warning, Sheldon.
The freezer locks from the outside.

- Did she seem upset to you?
- No. Did she seem upset to you?

- No.
- Oh, good, I got it right.

Are you upset?

A little bit.

Two for two. I'm on fire.

She's not my girlfriend but wouldn't
you think she'd feel a little bad...

...that I'm gonna be gone
for the whole summer?

That feels like a bonus question.

I'm gonna stop here while I'm ahead
but I've had a great time.

All right, and the purpose of this drill
is to acclimate us to the use of tools...

...in extreme temperatures
such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.

Then where are your tools?

Right here.

All right, team,
open up your practice kits.

As the university did not permit me
to bring the equipment we'll be using...

...to the Cheesecake Factory,
because apparently, I'm ridiculous...

...I've provided substitutes
which will exercise your fine motor skills.

Leonard, you will be doing a series
of complex mathematical problems...

...on a vintage Casio model 1175
calculator watch I received...

...when I won the Earth Science medal
in third grade.

Treat it with respect.

Raj, you will be painting sideburns
and a Vandyke...

...on a 6-inch figurine
of Legolas the Elf.

Now, remember, a Vandyke
is a goatee without a mustache.

Wolowitz, you will be completing a series
of delicate surgical procedures...

...on the classic children's game,
Operation.

To begin with,
you will remove funny bone for $200.

For this, I went to MIT.

And begin.

[GRUNTING & GAGGING]

I think I swallowed some paint.

I can't press any of the buttons
with my gloves.

Oh, son of a bitch.

Adversity is to be expected. Continue.

[BUZZ]

Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

- Okay, I can't do this.
- Me either.

Gentlemen, use your imagination.
Innovate.

Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze
to death on the ice planet of Hoth?

No, he cut open a tauntaun and used
its internal body heat to warm him up.

You heard the man.
Hold him down and I'll cut him open.

Hang on. I know I don't possess the tools
of leadership, but I don't understand...

...why we can't assemble the equipment
inside the hut and then take it outside.

I hadn't thought of that.

I guess we're done here.

Here, drink-slash-eat this.

- What is it?
- It's hot chocolate with a stick of butter.

Okay, why?

In the frigid temperatures
in the Arctic...

...we need to consume 5000 calories
a day to maintain our body weight.

You know I can't eat butter.
I'm lactose intolerant.

Way ahead of you. That's an
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! stick.

But, Mommy, all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

I don't care
what the other guys are doing.

If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal...

...and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,
would you?

If you were standing behind me nagging,
I might.

Don't talk back to your mother.
This trip is much too dangerous.

No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

I understand you're concerned.

If it'll make you feel better,
my mother is fine with me going.

And this is a woman who kept
a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.

So she has no problem
with her son being eaten by a walrus?

That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn...

...or being ripped to shreds
by a 1500-pound polar bear.

Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

MRS. WOLOWITZ [ON SPEAKERPHONE]:
Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas.

I didn't say that.
You never listen to me.

He doesn't tell me anything.

He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed.

Hey, Leonard,
can I talk to you for a sec?

Sure, but let's go out here where
there's a little less yelling and guilt.

What's up?

Well, I got you
a little going-away present.

- Oh, a blanket.
- Oh, no, no. Not just a blanket.

See, it has sleeves.

Yeah.

So you can, you know, be all snoodled
up while you do your science stuff.

Oh, wow. Cool.

I'm gonna miss you.

- See you later.
- Bye.

MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI: I told you no.
Why don't you believe me?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Because it doesn't make sense to me.

How can it be
that in the entire country of India...

...there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?

[KNOCKING]

Sheldon.

- Sheldon?
- I want a cookie, Meemaw.

- Sheldon, it's me.
- But Meemaw just made cookies.

Listen, I don't know if I can go
on the expedition.

- What?
- I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

Okay. Leonard, I know you're concerned
about disappointing me...

...I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge...

...that my expectations of you
are very low.

Yeah, that's very comforting.

Comforting is a part of leadership.

It's not a part I care for
but such is my burden.

Terrific. It's just that
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

Assuming that's a valid reason not to go,
which it isn't...

...how do you know this?
Did she say it?

Not exactly.

But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

- What is it?
- It's a blanket with sleeves.

Oh, that's clever.

Let me see if I understand this.

Her missing you,
is an emotional state you find desirable.

- Yes, obviously.
- All right.

Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving...

...logic dictates you must leave.

Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

She does have a short attention span.

- So I can't go.
- Leonard, you may be right.

It appears that Penny secretly
wants you in her life...

...in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

- You really think so?
- Of course not.

Even in my sleep-deprived state...

...I've managed to pull off
another one of my classic pranks.

Buzzinga.

- Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
- Seven a.m. I'm sorry it's early.

But we're leaving soon
and I needed to talk to you.

Okay.

What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

I don't know.
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

Okay. Well, what about this?
What does this mean?

Wine, a credit card and late-night
television are a bad combination?

All right, fine.

What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

That wasn't a long hug.

It was at least five Mississippis.

A standard hug
is two Mississippis, tops.

Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

- Glad we cleared that up.
- Yeah.

- I guess I'll see you.
- Okay.

- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

[SIGHS]

It means I wish you weren't going.

[WIND HOWLING]

- Damn it.
- What?

We're out of ice.

All right, we begin initial assembly and
deployment of the testing equipment...

...starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,
but until then, you are all off duty.

I suggest you keep the shenanigans
to a minimum...

...as medical help is 18 hours away
by dogsled.

- What are you working on?
- Crossbow.

Hey, guys, can I just say something?

How about we take a moment
to think about where we are?

I mean, this is literally
the top of the world.

Only a handful of people
in all of human history...

...will ever see
what we are going to see.

- He's right.
- Yeah, wow.

It is remarkable.

So who's up for a movie?

Good idea. What do you think?

Ice Station Zebra
or John Carpenter's The Thing?

- I say double feature.
- Dinner's ready.

SHELDON: What are we having?
- Reconstituted Thai food.

Did you bring the dehydrated
low-sodium soy sauce?

- Check.
- Freeze-dried spicy mustard?

- Check.
- And flash-frozen brown rice, not white?

- Uh, oh. Sorry.
- Not to worry.

I hid it.

[LAUGHS]

Buzzinga.

You're in my spot.

There's no time for a crossbow,
find me an icicle.

SHELDON:
Three months. This is gonna be great.

[English - US - SDH]

<i>Previously on The Big Bang Theory:</i>

I'm going to the Arctic Circle with
Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

- For three months?
- Yes.

What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

It means I wish you weren't going,

Oh, thank God we're home.

I can't believe we spent three months
in that frozen hell,

It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

I don't know what Arctic expedition
you were on...

...I thought it was a hoot and a half.

Oh, hi, Mom.

No. I told you I'd call you when I got home.
I'm not home yet.

All right. I'm home.

The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize
in my future.

Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.

No, Mother, I could not feel
your church group praying for my safety.

The fact that I'm home safe
doesn't prove it worked.

<i>That logic is post hoc
ergo propter hoc.</i>

No, I'm not sassing you
in Eskimo talk.

- I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.
- Mother, I have to go.

Yeah, love you. Bye.

Hello, old friend.

Daddy's home.

Leonard, you're back.

Yeah, I just stopped by to say...

- Yeah, so hi.
- Hi.

Damn it, I should've gone over
and told her we were back.

Yeah, it was first come, first serve.

I just want you both to know,
when I publish my findings...

- ...I won't forget your contributions.
- Great.

I can't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech.

When I write my memoirs...

...you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy.

- We have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

Damn his Vulcan hearing.

You are planning a party for me,
aren't you?

Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

If there's going to be a theme,
I should let you know...

...I don't care for luau, toga
or under the sea.

Yeah. We'll keep that in mind.
Look, we need to talk to you...

...about something that happened
at the North Pole.

If this is about the night
the heat went out...

...there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

- It's not about that.
- We agreed to never speak of it again.

So we slept together naked.

It was only to keep our core
body temperatures from plummeting.

- He's speaking about it.
- For me it was a bonding moment.

Sheldon, you remember
the first few weeks...

...we were looking for magnetic monopoles
and not finding anything...

...and you were acting
like an obnoxious giant dictator?

I thought we were gonna be gentle
with him.

That's why I added the "tator."

And when we finally got
our first positive data...

...you were so happy.

Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons,
I was colon, capital D.

Well, ahem, in actuality,
what your equipment detected...

...wasn't so much evidence
of paradigm-shifting monopoles...

...as it was static from the electric
can opener we were turning on and off.

He just went colon, capital O.

- You tampered with my experiment?
- We had to.

It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

You see that? I added the "ensian."

Did Leonard know about this?

Leonard's my best friend.
Surely Leonard didn't know.

- It was his idea.
- Of course it was.

The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

- I couldn't think of anyone else.
- Me neither.

Except for one night
when the heat went out.

Long story. It's... Don't ask.

Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

Do not make a sound.

Whispering, "Do not make a sound"...

...is a sound.

Damn his Vulcan hearing.

Not a good time, Sheldon.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Ugh, this is ridiculous.

- What?
- Hello, Penny.

I realize you're currently at the mercy
of your biological urges...

...but as you have a lifetime of poor
decisions ahead, may I interrupt this one?

Great to see you too. Come on in.

Wolowitz has informed me
of your grand deception.

Do you have anything to say?

Yes, I feel terrible about it.
I will never forgive myself.

I don't expect you to. I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave me with Penny...

...for a session of self-criticism
and repentance.

Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

What's going on is I was led to believe
I was making strides in science...

...when in fact
I was being fed false data...

...at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy.

Is that true?

- It was the only way to make him happy.
- Why'd you have to make him happy?

Because when he wasn't happy
we wanted to kill him.

That was even a plan.

We were going to throw
his Kindle outside.

And when he went to get it, lock
the door and let him freeze to death.

- That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
- No.

The overreaction was to tie your limbs
to four different sled-dog teams...

...and yell, "Mush!"

Look, we kept the original data.
You can still publish the actual results.

Yes,, but the actual results
are unsuccessful.

I sent an e-mail
to everyone at the university...

...explaining I confirmed
string theory...

...and forever changed
man's understanding of the universe.

Oh. See, yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

So write another e-mail.
Set the record straight. It's no big deal.

You're right, Leonard.
That's not a big deal.

All you did was lie to me,
destroy my dream...

...and humiliate me
in front of the whole university.

That, FYI, was sarcasm.

I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.

- Oh. That poor thing.
- Yeah, I feel terrible.

Wait.
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?

Well, I... He'll be fine.
The guy's a trouper. Come here.

No, no, you're right.
You shouldn't talk to him. I will.

Man, I cannot catch a break.

- Hey. Do you wanna talk?
- About what?

Being betrayed by my friends?

Spending three months at the North Pole
for nothing?

And I didn't even get to go
to Comic-Con.

Oh, hon...

<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

That's for when I'm sick.
Sad is not sick.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know your sad song.

I don't have a sad song.
I'm not a child.

Well, you know, I do understand
what you're going through.

Really? Did you have
the Nobel Prize in waitressing...

...stolen from you?

Well, no.

But, uh, when I was in high school,
one of my friends heard...

...I was gonna be named
head cheerleader. I was so excited.

My mom even made me
a celebration pie.

Then they named stupid
Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.

Big old slutbag.

Are you saying
that you think a celebration pie...

...is even remotely comparable
to a Nobel Prize?

Well, they're pretty tasty.

And on a different
but not unrelated topic...

...based on your current efforts
to buoy my spirits...

...do you truly believe that you
were ever fit to be a cheer leader?

Look, I just don't think
that the guys and Leonard...

...really meant to hurt you.
They just told an unfortunate lie...

...to deal with a difficult situation.
You know what it's like?

<i>Remember the new Star Trek movie?
Kirk has to take over the ship...</i>

...so he tells Spock stuff
he knew wasn't true.

Like saying Spock didn't care
his mom died.

<i>I missed Comic-Con
and the new Star Trek movie?</i>

- I like the new look.
- Thanks.

I call it the Clooney.

I call it the Mario and Luigi,
but whatever.

Hey, how's Sheldon doing?

He came out of his room
wearing his Darth Vader helmet...

...and tried to choke me to death
with the Force, so I'd say a little better.

If I may abruptly change the subject,
did you and Penny finally...? You know.

- Howard.
- I don't care...

...but my genitals wanted me to ask.

Tell your genitals what I do with Penny
is none of their business.

He says they didn't do it.

Sheldon, over here.

What are you doing?

Well, I feel bad for the guy.

Sheldon, why are you sitting
by yourself?

Because I am without friends.

Like the proverbial cheese,
I stand alone.

Even while seated.

Come on. We said we were sorry.

It's going to take more
than an "I'm sorry"...

...and an apology pie from Penny
to make up for what you've done to me.

Hey, Cooper.
Read your retraction e-mail.

Way to destroy your reputation.

You see? People have been pointing
and laughing at me all morning.

It's not true.

People have been pointing and laughing
at you your whole life.

All right, I've had enough.
Attention, everyone.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

As many of you
in the Physics Department know...

...my career trajectory
has taken a minor detour.

Off a cliff.

- My credibility may have been damaged.
- Completely wrecked.

But I would like to remind you that in
science there's no such thing as failure.

There once was a man...

...who referred to his prediction
of a cosmological constant...

...as the single biggest blunder
of his career.

That man's name was, surprise, surprise,
Albert Einstein.

Yeah, but research into dark energy
proved...

...Einstein's cosmological constant
was actually right all along.

So you're still, surprise, surprise,
a loser.

Oh, you think you're so clever.

Well, let me just tell you.
While I do not currently have a retort...

...check your e-mail periodically
for a doozy.

So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

Well, we'll always have the night
the heat went out.

- Hi.
- Hey.

Since we got interrupted last night,
I didn't have a chance to give you this.

Aw, Leonard. You shouldn't have.

Oh, boy. Ha, ha.

What is it?

It's a snowflake from the North Pole.

- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

It'll last forever. I preserved it in a
1-percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.

God, that's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever said to me...

...that I didn't understand.

It's actually a pretty simple process.

You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers,
which polymerize...

Red alert. Leonard, Sheldon ran away.

Man, I cannot catch a break.

So how do you know he ran away?

I mean, he's not answering his phone,
he handed in his resignation...

...and he sent me a text that said,
"I'm running away."

Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

Well... Leonard.
Aren't you gonna do something?

Well, of course
I'm gonna do something.

Uh, Howard, check the comic-book store.

Raj, go to the Thai restaurant.
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

Oh, damn it.

It's Sheldon's mother.

A break cannot be caught.

Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

He is?

Sheldon went home to Texas.

Yeah... No, I know he resigned.

Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault.

No, no. You're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.

Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah.
All right.

New plan.

Howard, you and Raj go to Texas,
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

- You're not gonna go with them?
- Well, you know...

...I gave you the snowflake,
and we were kissing, and...

Come on. I don't wanna go to Texas.

Oh, right. And I do? My people already
crossed the desert once. We're done.

Trust me, you'll be fine. See you.

Well, wait a second, Leonard.
Come on. How can you not go?

- He's your best friend.
- But I already saw him naked.

- Just come here.
- No.

I promise I will be here
when you get back.

Just go help Sheldon.

- Really?
- Yeah.

We waited a few months.
We can wait a few more days.

Maybe you can.

Go.

Boy, you cannot catch a break,
can you?

- Here you go, Shelly.
- Thanks, Mom.

Yeah.

Hold your horses, young man.
Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.

Oh, Mom.

This is not California,
land of the heathen.

Give me.

By his hand we are all...

Fed.

- Give us, Lord, our daily...
- Bread.

- Please know that we are truly...
- Grateful.

- For every cup and every...
- Plateful.

Amen.

Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

My objection was based
on considerations other than difficulty.

Whatever. Jesus still loves you.

Thank you for carving a smiley face
in my sandwich.

I know how to take care of my baby.

His eyes came out a little thin,
but you can just pretend he's Chinese.

So do you want to talk
about what happened...

...with you and your little friends?

- They're not my friends.
- All right.

If you recall, when you were little
we sat right here at this very spot...

...and talked about the problems you had
getting along with the neighbor kids.

That was different. They were
threatened by my intelligence...

...and too stupid to know
that's why they hated me.

Oh, baby, they knew very well
why they hated you.

I can't believe
you bought a red cowboy hat.

Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck.

Plus it was the only boys' large
they had.

I'm sorry. This does not look like Texas.
Where's the tumbleweeds?

- Where's the saloons?
- Saloons?

Like in the movies I saw growing up.

<i>You know, uh, 4 for Texas,
Yellow Rose of Texas.</i>

<i>This neighborhood
is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.

What can I tell you?

They probably have steaks on sale
at that big-ass Costco over there.

Will you please take that stupid hat off?

No, I wanna blend in.

<i>To what? Toy Story?</i>

Hi, boys.

- Howdy, ma'am.
- Howdy to you too. You got here quick.

- We took the redeye.
- Come on in.

Thank you kindly.

- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.

If y'all don't mind,
I got a hankering for a Lone Star Beer.

There's no alcohol in this household,
stop talking like that and lose the hat.

Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-hoo
if you have it.

You'll take a cola.

What about you? Raj, is it?

Oh, you still having trouble talking
to the ladies? Ha-ha-ha.

Because, you know, at our church...

...we have a woman
who's an amazing healer.

Mostly she does crutch
and wheelchair people...

...but I bet she'd be willing
to take a shot...

...at whatever Third-World demon
is running around inside of you.

If you don't mind, there's a 3:05
nonstop back to Los Angeles...

...and you have no idea
how much I wanna be on it.

- A girl?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

Oh, good. I've been praying for you.

Oh, Sheldon.

What are they doing here?

- We came to apologize.
- Again.

And bring you home.
Pack up your stuff and we'll head back.

No. This is my home now.

Thanks to you, my career is over.
I will spend the rest of my life here...

...trying to teach evolution
to creationists.

You watch your mouth, Shelly.

Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.

And that is your opinion.

I forgive you, let's go home.

Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.

How about that?
Finally caught a break.

Uh-huh.

You know how they say
when friends have sex it can get weird?

Sure.

- Why does it have to get weird?
- Pbbt. I don't know.

I mean, we were friends
and now we're more than friends.

And we're whatever this is.
But why label it, right? I mean...

It is what it is and...

- Leonard?
- Yeah?

- It's weird.
- Totally.

Sheldon, you're wrong.

Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

Don't you think if I were wrong,
I'd know it?

- First of all...
- Give it up.

You're arguing with a crazy person.

I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing here?

What? It's new-comic-book night.

Since you and Penny hooked up...

...we thought you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

There's more to life than sex, Raj.

Who had Leonard flames out
in 24 hours?

I did.

Nothing flamed out.

We don't have to have sex
every night.

You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

Take advantage
of that window of opportunity...

...before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

It's not a matter of opportunity.

We're getting to know each other.
There's a learning curve.

What's to learn?
You get naked, do nasty things.

Then somebody makes scrambled eggs
and salami. Easy-peasy.

Perhaps what Leonard
is obliquely referring to...

...is the occurrence
of sexual dysfunction.

Okay, who had
Leonard gets a floppy disk?

Oh. A clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism
for insufficient blood flow...

...to the male sex organ.

Nothing like that happened, all right?
The sex was just fine.

Just fine?

<i>Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Pottermovie
was just fine.</i>

I'm not saying it was bad.
I'm just saying it wasn't great.

Okay, you mean for both of you?

Because we can totally see it
not being great for her. Am I right?

To tell you the truth, I think
we were both a little... I don't know...

- Disappointed? Let down?
- Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

All I know is
it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.

Sex is never the way
I dream it's gonna be.

That's because in your dreams,
you're a horse from the waist down.

<i>Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin
Miniseries Issue 2, page 22.</i>

Retractable bone claws.

If you spent less time thinking about sex
and more time on comic books...

...we'd have far fewer
of these embarrassing moments.

Sheldon, dinner's here.

Tandoori Palace?

No, we went somewhere new.

You're good-naturedly ribbing me,
aren't you?

No, look, Mumbai Palace.

Why? Why would we change?

We had a perfectly good palace.
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

Trust me, this will be just fine.

You are the authority on just fine.

What's that supposed to mean?

Exactly. Not bad, but not great.

- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

- I know. As I'm sure you're aware...
- Dut! Dut-dut-dut-dut!

If that's Morse code, that's terrible.

As I was saying, you and Leonard
had a disappointing sexual encounter.

Earlier this evening,
Leonard characterized it as, "Just fine."

So, what you're seeing is a continuation
of the mocking that followed.

Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat
my dinner elsewhere.

Maybe an airplane headed
for a mountainside.

Penny, wait. Aah.

What is wrong with you?

I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

- Yeah, you...
- Don't tell him.

Let's see if he can figure it out.

- Ugh. I am so embarrassed.
- Please don't be mad.

- What did you tell them?
- Nothing bad.

Just that last night was fine.

Fine? You said it was fine?

Yeah. It's a perfectly good word.

You put it in front of "wine" or "dining"
and you've really got something.

Okay, well, let me ask you this,
how was last night for you?

It was...

...okay.

Okay?

Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"
and you really got something.

All right, let's not overreact.

It takes time
to get to know each other's rhythms.

Learn what the other person wants
and likes.

- So you've been through this before?
- No.

Okay-dokay.

This is one of those things where talking
about it is not gonna make it better.

- Want a glass of wine? Okay.
- So much.

See, we should've done this last night,
you know?

Had a little wine, take the edge off.

Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits
electrical conduction in the nerve cells...

...and stimulates reuptake receptors
of inhibitory neurotransmitters...

...like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

Don't talk. Just drink.

No, you're misunderstanding.

A shiksa goddess
isn't an actual goddess.

We don't pray to them.
We prey on them.

Whatever, dude. The point is
Leonard's got one and you don't.

Is this it?

It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard
and Penny's sex life...

...in front of Leonard and Penny.

Good.

Now I can eat.

- What's that?
- Sounds like a cricket.

Hang on.

Based on the number of chirps
per minute and the temperature...

...it is a snowy tree cricket.

Oh. Give me a fricking break.
How could you possibly know that?

In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined
there was a fixed relationship...

...between the number of chirps per
minute and the ambient temperature.

A precise relationship that is not present
with ordinary field crickets.

How do you know the temperature
of this room?

Under the terms of my roommate
agreement I've had control...

...of the thermostat
ever since the sweaty night of '06.

Okay, you were right about Wolverine
and bone claws...

...but you're wrong about the cricket.

Howard, don't embarrass yourself.
The science chirps for itself.

Humorous word play.

No, no. Not this time.
I know insects, my friend.

I spent many childhood years capturing
them with nets, putting them in jars...

...sticking pins through them, mounting
them on cardboard with labels...

...identifying the genus and species.

In Latin.

Oh. Dude, you are never getting
a shiksa goddess.

<i>That is a snowy tree cricket.
Oecanthus fultoni.</i>

I was done with Latin by fifth grade.

Okay. Tell you what.

I am willing to bet anything
that's an ordinary field cricket.

- I can't take your money.
- What's the matter, you chicken?

I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

Chickens are not at all timid.

In fact, when I was young,
my neighbor's chicken got loose...

...and chased me up the big elm tree
in front of our house.

- Chickens can't climb trees.
- Thank God.

Okay, I believe a chicken made you
his bitch.

The cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.

Fair enough.

What stakes do you propose?

<i>I will put up
my Fantastic Four Number 48...</i>

...first appearance of Silver Surfer...

<i>...against your Flash 123,
the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" issue.</i>

All right, you have a wager.

Hmm.

Great.
Now, how are you gonna settle it? Hmm?

There is no way to determine the species
of the cricket without examining it.

I wonder what the non-pathetic people
are doing tonight.

- More wine?
- Hit me.

- I don't see anything.
- Shh.

Hallway.

Ahh.

One at a time.

What was that?

My stomach.

Indian food doesn't agree with me.

Ironic, isn't it?

Elevator shaft.

Help me open it.

Are you crazy? We can't go down
an empty elevator shaft.

If you don't wanna proceed,
then you forfeit the bet...

<i>...and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.</i>

Let's open her up.

Are you bothered
that I can so easily manipulate you?

Don't push me, Sheldon.

I may be small,
but I took kung fu when I was 13...

...and I remember a good deal of it.

Oh, really?

I grew up with an older brother
and a very contentious twin sister.

And I could easily best you
in any physical confrontation.

Be it noogies, swirlies or the classic,
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

Ooh. Big talk from a man who was once
treed by a chicken.

- Ahem.
- What are we drinking now?

Peppermint schnapps.

Why would you
buy peppermint schnapps?

Because I like peppermint
and it's fun to say "schnapps."

- Hey, Leonard?
- What?

Schnapps.

Schnapps.

You're right, that is fun.

Be careful.

If I were not being careful...

...your telling me to be careful
would not make me careful.

Stairwell.

Uh-oh. Flashlight went out.
I need some batteries.

Fellas?

Hello?

It's really dark down here.

Oh, sweetie, you really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

I'm okay.

Just a little mouthwash
and then I'm gonna rock your world.

Are you okay?

Oh. Toby, what did you do in a past life
to be so disgusting now?

His name isn't Toby.

Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.

- What would you name him?
- An appropriate cricket name.

For example, Jiminy.

All right, Sheldon, here we go.

<i>Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects.</i>

Hey, Toby.

Right here.

<i>See it? "The common field cricket,
a.k.a. Gryllus assimilis"...</i>

...which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."

Hang on.

<i>Voilà. "The snowy tree cricket,
a.k.a. Oecanthus fultoni"...</i>

...which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing."

<i>Of course, I'm joking, because the Latin
for that is "nihil exsorbibo."</i>

That is not Toby, this is Toby.

Raj, what do you think?

Oh. I really don't care anymore.

- God, I had the most horrible night.
- What happened?

Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the "shiksi" goddess.

Shiksa. Shiksa.

Forgive me.
Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.

And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

Yeah, fine, whatever.
The point is you're wrong, again.

We haven't established
that I'm wrong once.

Let's go down
to the Entomology Department...

...and let Professor Crawley tell us
what kind of cricket Toby is.

He's a snowy tree cricket.
And his name is Jiminy.

I bet I could throw a rock in this room
and come up with three better friends.

Holy crap.

<i>It's like Silence of the Lambs
down here.</i>

Don't do that.

Don't be such a girl. They're just bugs.

I don't like bugs, okay?
They freak me out.

Interesting.

You're afraid of insects and women.

Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

It was a joke.

I made it to lessen your discomfort.

You're welcome.

Ha-ha. Don't knock. Just walk in.

Why be polite to the world's leading
expert on the dung beetle?

Excuse me,
are you Professor Crawley?

Who wants to know?

I'm Dr. Cooper,
from the Physics Department.

- Couldn't wait, huh?
- I'm sorry?

I haven't even packed yet
and you're already measuring my lab...

...for one
of your godless laser machines.

No, you don't understand.
We just wanna ask you a question.

Let me ask you one first.

What's a world-renowned entomologist
with a doctorate...

...and 20 years of experience,
to do with his life...

...when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

Ask rhetorical questions
that make people uncomfortable?

What's your deal?

Are they planning to outsource my job
to Bangalore?

I'm from New Delhi.

- We should find another entomologist.
- We're here. Let's settle this.

Professor,
can you identify our cricket?

Of course I can.

I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

Not that that's gonna keep me from
having to move in with my daughter...

...in Oxnard. And we're not talking
Oxnard at the beach. No.

We're talking Oxnard
in the onion fields.

- Well, could you look at Toby?
- Toby?

What a stupid name for a cricket.

Told you.

It's a field cricket.

- Yes.
- No, wait.

Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

Young man, I've been studying insects
since I was 8 years old.

You know what they used to call me
in school?

Creepy Crawley.

Cruel as that may be,
that is not in itself a credential.

Let me show you something.

See that?
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

I discovered it after spending
six months...

...slogging through
the Bornean rain forests...

...while my wife was back home...

...shacking up
with a two-bit ornithologist...

...who lives on a sailboat
and likes to wear boot-cut jeans.

So when I tell you
that that's a common field cricket...

...you can take that
to the damn bank.

Because God knows I can't.

That tramp took me for everything.

Well, apparently I was wrong.

Congratulations.

Enjoy Oxnard.

I'm sure your daughter's looking forward
to having you.

Oh, hey, Sheldon.
What you got there? New comic book?

Old comic book.

I just retrieved it
from my safe-deposit box.

What do you have
a safe-deposit box for?

Old comic books.

I lost this to Wolowitz
in an ill-considered cricket wager.

What, do they have Wii cricket now?

That can't be very popular.

Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.

Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not feeling so hot either.

Why would that make me feel better?

I don't know, empathy?

I'm just saying that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard...

...and I'm upset about something
with Leonard.

Yes, the disappointing sex.

That's an inexact parallel.

You and Leonard can always return
to being friends.

I can never return to a state
in which Wolowitz has not bested me...

...like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

- Okay, forget the chicken.
- I wish I could.

No, no.
You may be right about me and Leonard.

Well, of course I'm right. What are the
odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?

No, I mean,
we can always go back to being friends.

I just said that... This conversation
has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.

- Hello.
- Hey.

What's going on?

Oh, you'd like to catch up
on the events of the day. All right.

Well, there was a half-hour wait at the
bank to get into my safe-deposit box.

I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems.

And, oh, yes, in a moment filled
with biblical resonance...

...pride wenteth before my fall...

<i>...causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.</i>

Wait a minute.
You talked to Penny about our sex life?

Leonard, it astonishes me
how you continually fixate on the trivial.

I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

- You're saying you talked to Penny?
- Yes.

- Interesting.
- Hardly.

Excuse me.

Have I crossed
some sort of line again?

Little bit.

Hmm.

Oh. Who cares?

- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?

Not a lot. That we always have the
option of going back to being friends.

- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

I mean, you have to admit...

...things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

I guess.

- It would take the pressure off.
- It would, wouldn't it?

So we'll just be friends.

Good. Good.

Come here.

Okay-dokay.

<i>Goin' out tonight</i>

<i>I'm feelin' all right</i>

<i>Gonna let It all hang out</i>

<i>Wanna make some noise</i>

<i>Really raise my voice</i>

<i>Yeah, I wanna scream and shout</i>

<i>Unh! No...</i>

Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.

No.

Why not?

Penny, while I subscribe
to the Many-Worlds theory...

...which posits the existence of infinite
Sheldons in an infinite number...

...of universes, I assure you
that none of them am I dancing.

Are you fun in any of them?

The math would suggest that in a few,
I'm a clown made of candy.

But I don't dance.

- All right, want some French toast?
- It's oatmeal day.

Tell you what, next French toast day,
I will make you oatmeal.

Dear Lord, are you still going
to be here on French toast day?

Morning.

Look, Leonard,
Penny made French toast.

Sorry, I haven't given her
your schedule yet.

It's an iCal download.
She can put it right in her phone.

And we agreed you'd have
conjugal visits in her apartment.

We did, but there
were extenuating circumstances.

I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping
skills finally trump her perkiness?

No, her bed kind of broke.

That doesn't seem likely.
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

Even the addition
of a second normal-sized human...

...wouldn't cause a structural failure,
much less a homunculus such as yourself.

A homunculus?

Perfectly formed miniature human being.

Oh, you're my little homunculus.

Don't do that.

Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup
and who wants cinnamon sugar?

- I want oatmeal.
- Yes, well...

...I want a boyfriend whose roommate
isn't a giant pain in the ass.

- Ha, ha.
- I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

You know what? I give up.
He's impossible.

I can't be impossible, I exist.

I believe what you meant to say is,
"I give up. He's improbable."

Sheldon, you need to find
a better way of dealing with Penny.

What am I supposed to do?

Eat French toast on a Monday?
Now, that would be impossible.

I'm saying you can catch more flies
with honey than vinegar.

You can catch even more flies
with manure. What's your point?

It's a...

Boy, that does smell good.

Too bad it's Monday.

Kim, the night manager,
went on maternity leave...

...and her husband's name is Sandy.

So get this, her replacement
is a woman named Sandy...

...whose husband's name is Kim.

- Wow.
- I know. What are the odds? Oh.

Easily calculable. We begin by identifying
the set of couples with unisex names.

We eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work:

the aged, the imprisoned
and the limbless, for example.

- Next, we look at the...
- Sheldon.

It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?

I'm sorry.

Oh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake
Factory is run by witches.

Oh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think
I'll punch you.

Come on, you guys. Let it go.

Fine, whatever.

Are you finished?

Well, thank you. How thoughtful.

Would you like a chocolate?

Um, yeah, sure.

Thanks.

What was that?

You said be nice to Penny.

I believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of "nice."

It does. But in my experience, you don't.

There are more things in heaven
and Earth, Horatio...

...than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

Yeah, now, that's you.
Obnoxious and insufferable.

What's going on, day dwellers?

Oh, man, did the KISS Army repeal
"Don't ask, don't tell"?

No. Raj and I are going to a goth club
in Hollywood...

...to hang with the night people.

Wanna come along?

Oh, wow, you're actually going out
like that?

No, ha, ha. No. I'm going out like this.

Howard, what did you do?

They're called tattoo sleeves. Look.

Yeah, I bought them online.
Raj got a set too.

Fantastic, right?

Put them on, have sex with some girl
with her business pierced...

...take them off, and I can still be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

You know, I've always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub.

- Really?
- Buzzinga.

None of you ever see
my practical jokes coming, do you?

Okay, how about you two?
Look, I got some extra tat sleeves.

Why are you carrying extras?

In case I snag one
on someone's nipple ring.

Yeah, I think we'll pass.

Oh, is the missus speaking
for the couple now?

In this case, you bet she is.

Ahh. Yes, she's pushy and, yes,
he's whipped, but that's not the expression.

Come on, I wanna stop at Walgreens
and pick up some more eyeliner.

They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

They're gonna get beaten up
at Walgreens.

Oh, sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.

Did you? I didn't notice.

Have a chocolate.

Thank you.

I think we're fitting in quite nicely.

It'd help
if you weren't drinking light beer.

Well, what's so gothic
about vodka and cranberry juice?

Hello? It looks like blood.

Did you even read the wikiHow link
I sent you on being goth?

No, I'm behind on my wiki reading.

I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick
right now.

<i>- What?
- I finished reading The Pelican Brief...</i>

<i>...and loved it so much,
I dived right into The Client.</i>

He was a lawyer himself, so his novels
are accurate as well as entertaining.

Just remember, we are lost boys.
Children of the night.

Great. Lost boys, children of the night.
Got it.

Can you pass the Chex Mix, please?

Thank you.

We are lost boys.

Good for you.

I'm actually much more lost than he is.

Nice ink.

Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

Two light beers.

Light beers. Well, wikiHow about that?

What's your names?

- I'm Howard.
- Raj.

- I'm Bethany.
- Nice to meet you, Bethany.

Yes, very nice.

Nice to meet you too.

I'm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.

Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels
of John Grisham?

What's this cartoon called again?

<i>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</i>

And it's not a cartoon, it's anime.

Anime. You know, I knew a girl
in high school named Anna May.

Anna May Fletcher.

She was born with one nostril.

Then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three.

You're here a lot now.

Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

Chocolate?

Yes, please.

- Oh. Hey, Kim.
- Ahh.

Yeah, I...

You know what? Hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.

<i>Chocolate?</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

You'll never guess who they got
to replace you at work.

Okay.

I know what you're doing.

Really?

Yes. You're using chocolates
as positive reinforcement...

...for what you consider correct behavior.

Very good.

- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate.

Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend
like a lab rat.

Actually, it turns out I can.

Well, you shouldn't.

Oh, ugh.
There's just no pleasing you, is there?

You weren't happy
with my approach with her...

...so I decided to employ operant
conditioning techniques...

...building on the works of Thorndike
and B.F. Skinner.

Next week, I believe
I can have her jumping out of a pool...

...balancing a beach ball on her nose.

No, this has to stop now.

I'm not suggesting we really make her
jump out of a pool.

I thought the "buzzinga" was implied.

I'm just tweaking her personality,
sanding off the rough edges, if you will.

No, you're not sanding Penny.

Are you saying that I am forbidden
from applying a harmless...

...scientifically valid protocol
that will make our lives better?

Yes, you're forbidden.

Bad Leonard.

So, what do you guys do?

Oh, you know, goth stuff.
Goth magazines, goth music.

Goth food.

What's goth food?

Uh... Blackened salmon?

No, I meant, what do you do for jobs?

- Oh, we're scientists.
- Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

What are the dark sciences?

Well, I am an astrophysicist,
and a lot of that takes place at night.

When there are vampires
and miscellaneous undead out and about.

That sounds really cool.

Does it?
Well, okay, if you like space stuff...

...I designed components
for the space station. Which is in space.

Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

So, what do you gals do?

I work at the Gap.

Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.

I've been there as well.
I like your T-shirts with the little pocket.

I work there too.

Not that anyone cares.

You know, this place is boring.

Yeah. Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?

- Okay.
- Sure. We like fun.

We are fun people.

Uh, dark and fun.

Come on. I know a place you'll really dig.

- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

Let's go.

Are you happy now?

Not particularly.

Oh, my God, she didn't.

What could she possibly be talking
about for so long?

Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory...

...is a complex socio-economic activity...

...that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.

Buzzinga.

You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques...

...I could train that behavior out of her
in a week.

- No.
- If you let me use negative reinforcement...

...I can get it done before we go to bed.

You're not squirting her in the face
with water.

No, of course not.

We're talking very mild electric shocks.

No tissue damage whatsoever.

- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

You can't tell me
that you're not intrigued...

...about the possibility
of building a better girlfriend.

I'm not.

Penny's qualities, both good and bad,
are what make her who she is.

You mean like that
high-pitched irritating laugh?

Yes.

You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

You're not changing how Penny laughs.

No, that would be incongruous.

I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.

Ugh, sorry, guys.

That girl is freaky.

- Come again?
- Freaky.

- Freaky?
- Yeah, freaky.

Have a chocolate.

Thank you.

Are you seriously
going to deface your body...

...just on the possibility you could have
cheap sex with a girl you met in a bar?

Uh, yeah.

What is your mother going to say?

She's not gonna see it.

She takes my temperature orally now.

What are you gonna get?

Well, I can't really decide
between a screaming devil...

...this mean little skull,
or Kermit the Frog.

- Kermit the Frog?
- You know:

"Heigh-ho, I'm on Howard's butt."

Get the mean little skull,
and I'll see if I can make him smile.

Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

What are you gonna get, Raj?

With my luck, hepatitis.

Okay, here we go.

Ow, ow, ow.

That's just rubbing alcohol.

I know, but it was cold.

Ow, ow, ow.

I'm putting on the stencil.

- What comes after the stencil?
- This:

Aah! Okay, that's it. No needle.
No pain. No tattoo.

What's the big deal?
You've done this before.

No, I haven't. Look.

- I'm sorry. I'm a fraud. He's a fraud.
- We're both frauds.

- Yeah, I think I covered that.
- Well, I was summing up.

We're not goth. We're just guys.

Very, very smart guys.

So you were totally scamming us?

Yes.

And I wouldn't blame you
if you walked out of here...

...and never wanted to see us again.

Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.

Huh? Huh? Anything?

I'm leaving.

I'm leaving too.

Not that anyone cares.

When we tell this story,
let's end it differently.

What are you thinking,
maybe a big musical number?

Well, I'm going to make some warm milk
and then turn in.

I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities...

...you'll keep the decibel level
to a minimum.

Of course.

Thank you.

Mm. These are so good. Mm.

Unbelievable.

- What?
- I was just thinking...

...we should probably turn in too.

Well, my new bed got delivered.

If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

Really? That's a lot of work, and it's late.

Yeah, but we won't have to be quiet.

Let's go.

Interesting.

Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

I wonder if anyone else
has stumbled onto that.

Okay, wait, how about this?

We say there were four goth girls.

The two girls in the club had two friends.

I like it, I like it.

Did they smell good
despite their goth-like nature?

- What's that gotta do with the story?
- Engaging my olfactory sense...

- ...helps make it real for me.
- Fine, they smelled good.

Oh, they did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

- Whatever.
- And they held hands...

...and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey
for us.

No. Let me say my story all the way,
and then you can say yours...

- ...then we'll pick.
- I'm sorry. Go on.

We got tattoos, and then the four girls
took us to their place.

We don't have tattoos. What if someone
asks to see our tattoos?

We say they're in a very intimate area.

Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?

- Right. Right.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

So we go back to their place,
and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be
concerned about bacterial infection?

True. Okay, forget the hot tub.

The point is, we each had a ménage
with sexy goth girls.

Wow.

What a great night.

Yeah.

Hey, wanna try a country bar
tomorrow night?

Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky
with sexy cowgirls.

- Could happen.
- Ha, ha.

I wonder how they smell.

This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

What do you mean?

The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.

Don't get the gremlins wet.

How hard is that?

Hi, guys.

- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?

Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...

...Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...

...distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...

...in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.

You're boring people, sweetie.

Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.

- So, what are you guys doing?
- Celebrating Columbus Day.

<i>We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.</i>

They're all written by Chris Columbus.

Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?

The parade.

That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.

This year, they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

- What's he on trial for?
- Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.

- And you are all invited.
- Oh, I'll be there.

Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?

I guess I could serve both.

You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...

...my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.

Tur-briska-fil?

A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

It's not as good as it sounds.

Raj, what about you?

Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.

I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

So, what's going on with Raj?

Well, the good news
is he has no problem...

...with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

Hard to believe, but go on.

The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.

What do you mean
he's getting deported?

I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.

He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...

...or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

Personally, I'd choose pirate.

Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

Ugh. Fine, but the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.

Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

Okay, she's gone.

Sorry I lost my cool.

So, what's going on?

Okay, here's the deal.

Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...

...of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.

So?

My visa is only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.

By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."

I wish I had squat.

Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?

You know, checking e-mail...

...updating my Facebook status...

...messing up Wikipedia entries.

Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?

Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.

I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.

And there's so many people.

You have no idea. They're everywhere.

Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?

Why doesn't he just get another job?

What are you asking me for?
I don't know if you can talk now or not.

Oh, beef.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

And the special sauce?

Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

- Don't worry. You'll find another job.
- Yeah, let me start practicing for it.

"Do you want fries
with that Maharaja Mac?"

Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.

Hello, Sheldon.

Forgive me.
I'm not adept at reading facial cues.

But I'm going to take a stab here.
You're either sad or nauseated.

- I'm sad.
- I was going to say sad.

I don't know why I hedged.

What are you eating?

Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger
and tomato sauce.

Oh, beefaroni.

I think I'll miss you most of all.

I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?

- We believe cows are gods.
- Not technically.

In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

I'm sorry.

Me too. I'm just... I'm a little on edge.

Mm, understandable. Your life seems
to be crumbling around you...

...and your future appears bleak at best.

Thank you.

And you're wrong
about Hinduism and cows.

Hey, Raj, Professor Laughlin
is looking for someone to join...

- ...the stellar evolution research team.
- You're kidding. That's fantastic.

- Call him and set up an interview.
- I'm on it.

- That's happy, right?
- Yeah.

Nailed it.

Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

I was surprised to hear you're interested
in joining our team.

Giving up on those
trans-Neptunian objects, are we?

No, no. It's a very promising area.

In a perfect world,
I'd spend several more years on it.

I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to work with you...

...on your tremendously exciting and
not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.

Splendid. Please sit down.

Can I offer you a sherry?

It's a little early, isn't it?

Not on Proxima Centauri. Ha, ha.

Oh, that's very good.

Jolly amusing. But if you don't mind,
I'll hold off until sunset on Titan.

Ha, ha. Well done. I have a feeling
you're going to fit in fine, Dr. Koothrappali.

Thank you, sir.

I'm sorry. Am I late?

No, no. Right on time.

Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT.

She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali.

I read your paper on Kuiper Belt
object-size distribution.

I really enjoyed it.

How did you correct
for the selection bias?

Well, I ran a simulation.

Allowed me to correct
for the observational efficiency.

- Oh. That's just fascinating.
- Thank you.

Would you like to hear more about it
at my hot tub?

So when do I start?

You didn't get the job?
How could you not get it?

You know, he's British, I'm Indian.

Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

Are you saying that he discriminated
against you? We should file a complaint.

That's okay. Complaint's been filed.

So that's it.

That was my last hope.

I'm gonna be deported.
Sent home in disgrace.

Exposed to the sardonic barbs
of my cousin Sanjay.

Or as you may know him,
Dave from AT&T Customer Service.

- I'm really gonna miss you.
- Will you come visit me in India?

Gee, that's like a 17-hour flight.

How about I meet you halfway?

Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of Japan.

Tell you what, we'll Skype.

- Gentlemen.
- Hey.

Raj, did you get the job
with Professor Laughlin?

- No.
- I assumed as much, but never fear.

Like the subordinate male protagonist
in action movies who disappears...

...halfway through the second reel,
I have returned to save the day.

Odd. Usually he's met by cheers.

Anyway, I was thinking about exploring
the string theory implications...

...of gamma rays
from dark-matter annihilations.

- It occurred to me that I could...
- Excuse me.

How many reels before the subordinate
male protagonist gets to his point?

If you didn't cheer at my entrance,
it's too late to buy into the premise.

Anyway, I got some extra money
from the head of the department...

...and Raj can come work for me.

You want me to work with you?

For me.

You're going to have to listen
more carefully when you're on the job.

Okay. Please don't take this
the wrong way...

...but I'd rather swim buck naked
across the Ganges...

...with a paper cut on my nipple...

...and die a slow, agonizing death
from a viral infection...

...than work with you.

For me.

Sheldon, are you busy?

Of course I'm busy.

- Shall I wait?
- Yes, please.

How may I help you?

I've reconsidered your offer
to let me work with you.

For me.

Yes, for you.

I do, however, have a few conditions.

First, at all times, I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

Second, my contributions shall be noted
in published materials.

Third, you are never allowed to lecture me
on Hinduism or my Indian culture.

I'm impressed, Raj.

Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

- Thank you.
- I reject them all.

Then you leave me no choice.

I accept the job.

I'm sorry.
I believe you've misunderstood.

I'm not giving you the job.

I'm simply affording you the opportunity
to apply for it.

Have a seat.
We'll get started with the interview.

You're kidding.

Please.

All right.

So...

That's what you wear to an interview?

Come on, we've been friends for years.

Oh, pulling strings, are we?

Sheldon, for God's sakes,
don't make me beg.

Buzzinga.

You've fallen victim to another one
of my classic practical jokes.

I'm your boss now.
You may wanna laugh at that.

Ah. This is nice,
having the place to ourselves, isn't it?

Uh-huh.

Now that Raj is working for Sheldon,
I don't have to chauffeur him around.

Plus, yeah, with them working late
so much, we get some privacy.

Mm-hm.

Hey.

Wanna get a little crazy?

What are you thinking?

Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot
and make out.

You are a dirty girl.

Oh, God, how did he know?

Hello?

- Hi, Howard.
- Heh.

Am I interrupting?

Little bit, yeah.

Guess I should've called.

Yeah, maybe.

Tonight's the night I usually go
line dancing with Raj at the Palomino.

Uh-huh.

But he's working with Sheldon.

- Yes. We know.
- Hoo.

Want me to leave?

You know, whatever.

I guess I can hang for a little while.

So, what are we watching?

<i>Sex and the City, yikes.</i>

Hey, I happen to love this movie.

Fine. Let's watch it.

Maybe all our periods will synchronize.

We're going to be
designing an experiment...

...to look for the annihilation spectrum
resulting from dark-matter collisions.

Ooh, dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.

I was making a joke.

I'm the boss. I make the jokes.

Sorry. Go ahead and make your joke.

This is not the time for joking.

We're doing serious research
which requires complete and utter focus.

All right. Let's buckle down and work.

- Sheldon.
- What?

- I need an aspirin.
- Top desk drawer.

- Thank you.
- All right?

- Yes.
- Good.

That was fun, ha, ha.

Thank you.

Leonard, you don't have to say
thank you every time we have sex.

Oh, okay.

Tomorrow, you're gonna get a card
in the mail. Just throw it away.

Top of the morning to you.

What are you doing here?

Well, usually on Sundays...

...I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks
at the farmer's market...

...but he's still working with Sheldon.

So I thought I'd come over here
and make scrambled eggs and salami.

<i>It's the perfect meal for après I'amour.</i>

Kill me.

By the way, I couldn't help overhearing
your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.

See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me"..

...I wouldn't have had to hear that.

What do you guys think?
Wanna take in a matinée? Go rollerblading?

Catch a step class?

- Do something.
- Yeah. Okay. Um...

Howard, we need to talk.

Sure. What's up, homes?

Please understand that it's not
that we don't want you around.

But Penny and I
occasionally need some alone time.

Oh.

I get it. I'm the third wheel. Heh.

Sorry, I should've seen that.

I'll get out of your way.

Uh, you're gonna wanna eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

Thank you.

And there's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

The bagels are in the oven.
I was warming them up.

That's great.

I'm just gonna hang out with my mom.
That's always fun.

Good.

- Are we terrible people?
- I don't know.

What do you want me to do?

Ahh. Get him. Bring him back.

You sure?

Yeah.

Okay. Howard, come back.

Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

No, no. That rate is much too low from
what we'd expect from this collision.

Do you understand we're talking about
dark matter colliding in outer space?

Of course I understand. And who
are you to tell me about outer space?

Well, I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space."

"Astro" means "star."

Let me just tell you,
if we were having this argument...

...in my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

English is your native language.

Okay, you got me there.
But you're wrong about this.

There's a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

Unfortunately,
you have to be a visionary to see it.

God, you think that every thought that
comes out of your head is pure gold.

Let me tell you,
some of those thoughts are pure caca.

Caca?

- It means "doo-doo."
- All right.

First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first
proposed that you work with me...

Aha! So I am working with you?

In this context,
"with me" means "for me."

Oh. Yeah, well, in this context:

All right.

If I'm wrong, prove it.

Okay.

Here's where we derived the mass
of the dark-matter particle.

- You've misstated the weight.
- Let me finish.

- You're defacing my work.
- I'm not. I'm fixing it.

- Give me the eraser.
- No.

I said give it to me.

Come and get it.

Fine.

Oh, Lord.

Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior,
I forbid you from writing on my board.

- You are not my superior.
- I am in every way.

Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

Nice working with you.

I'm sorry. "For you."

Argh!

Raj?

Raj?

I'm busy.

Doing what?

- You've made your point.
- What do you want, Sheldon?

I looked over the board,
and it turns out you were right.

- You were wrong?
- I didn't say that.

- That's the only logical inference.
- I didn't say it.

Anyway, I would like you to come back
and work for me.

For you or with you?

In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me."

- I have conditions.
- I reject them all.

I'll take the job.

See you Monday.

- Wait. You have to drive me home.
- How did you get here?

- I walked.
- So walk home.

I can't. There's a big dog outside.

We can start thinking about methods
of optimizing the detector...

- ...for 500 GeV particles.
- All right.

All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...

...and I am going to back him up
with my Strangling Vines.

Choke on that, sucker.

Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.

That's right, I did it. I cut them.

Um...

I have a question.

Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...

...and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.

Unless you have the Carrot of Power.

Okay, I've got another question.

When does this get fun?

Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?

Just play a potion card.

Which one?

It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.

- Don't ruin the game.
- How could he ruin the game?

Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...

...which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...

...and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are:

Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.

See? Ruined.

Sheldon, that is incredible.

From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.

Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.

"Photographic" is a misnomer.

I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.

Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.

You had turkey
and complained it was dry.

Well, I guess game's over.

Really? Oh, great.

I mean, aww...

- Okay, I gotta go.
- Why?

Because last time I didn't go,
I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.

Not "Ka." Ka-ah.

- Bye.
- See you.

Still can't believe
she's going out with me.

Nobody can.

That reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.

- What?
- You and I made a pact...

...that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...

...that person
would have his girlfriend...

...hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.

- Yeah, I don't remember that.
- Wha...?

June 30th, 2004.

<i>Opening day of Spider-Man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.</i>

They only had red ICEES, no blue.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.

Where's my shorty, Morty?

Howard, you can't hold me to that.

- Why not?
- When I made that agreement...

...I didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and I was positive you never would.

- How come I wasn't part of this deal?
- You had left the refreshment stand...

...in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.

So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.

Damn.

Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

I'm sorry, no.

But you have a whole bunch of them.

Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.

Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.

If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...

...but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.

Good luck. That's the face napkin.

- So have you talked to Penny yet?
- No, I haven't.

- Why not?
- Because I've been busy.

Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.

And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...

...because I don't want to.

A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?

"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"

Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.

It's true. I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.

Leonard, come on.

- Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
- A hot friend.

- Right.
- And tall.

I want our kids to be able to ride
Space Mountain before they're 20.

I'll see what I can do.

Hey, guess what I heard today.

I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.

When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly heard:

"Hello. How are you, Raj?"

You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have heard:

"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."

Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?

That would probably save us
some time.

Saturday night
at the comic-book store...

...they're having a Mystic Warlords
of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is $500.

- If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
- I'm sorry, Raj.

I have no interest in playing a game
in which I find no challenge.

- But what about the money?
- I have money.

But this is other money.

How does it differ
from the money I have?

Half of it will be mine.

Do you need it
to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?

- Leonard, help.
- Are you kidding?

I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freaking napkins.

Wow, you really are a genius.

Not really. I Googled how to do that.

So listen...

Have you ever made a pact
with someone?

You mean like a pinky swear?

Okay, fine. Like a pinky swear.

In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

<i>- You know, from Sesame Street.
- I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.</i>

Then we found out
we both wanted Ernie.

We didn't speak again
till middle school.

Over puppets?

The heart wants what the heart wants,
Leonard.

Okay.

Speaking of what the heart wants, um...

...a long time ago I made a pact
with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...

...but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.

No, no, nothing like that.

No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...

...we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.

You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?

Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.

And during I was trying to remember
what I read on Google, so...

I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with my friends.

Come on,
it doesn't have to be a good friend.

And you know that deep down inside,
Howard's a really nice guy.

The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.

Will you at least think about it?

Just as a favor to me?

The great thing about Ernie
was he never asked me for anything.

He just gave.

Got it. Got it. Got it.

<i>Betty and Veronica. Oh.</i>

Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.

- Want me to set one aside for you?
- Thank you.

You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumble upon the figurine...

...and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession.

- All right, I won't.
- But I must have it.

- Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
- Thank you.

I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.

Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
for the Mystic Warlords Tournament...

<i>...the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?</i>

Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

Excuse me,
are you saying that Wil Wheaton...

<i>...a.k.a. Ensign Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The Next Generation...</i>

...is participating in your tournament?

I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?

No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.

You know, Wesley Crusher
had an eidetic memory just like me.

Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him...

...while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.

Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995
I traveled 10 hours by bus...

...to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi...

...wearing my Starfleet Academy
cadet uniform...

...in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph...

...my mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.

Yeah, my arduous journey, however,
was for naught.

Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.

It was at that moment
I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

Okay, great,
you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.

It might interest you to know
that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth...

...on my all-time enemies list, right
between director Joel Schumacher...

<i>...who nearly destroyed
the Batman movie franchise...</i>

...and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me...

...and put dog poop
on the handles of my bicycle.

Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.
Sign here.

<i>In the words of Khan Noonien Singh
in the immortal Wrath of Khan:</i>

"He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him."

- No doubt. Sign here.
- "From hell's heart, I stab at thee."

All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with...

..."Die, Wil Wheaton, die."

So tell me more
about the future mother of my children.

She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.

Great.

What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?

No, I thought
that'd be a nice surprise for her.

Good, good.

I told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages...

Six, if you count Klingon.

Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.

- Right?
- Right.

And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

- What?
- I'm kidding.

Another delightful surprise for her.

Sheldon, it's your play.

Sheldon.

My Enchanted Troll bludgeons
your Screaming Harpy...

...with a Cursed Mace. Game.

Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother
when she picks you up.

Or I could just tell her later tonight.
Ha-ha-ha.

We pawned them, dude. Up top.

Look at him.

Wil Wheaton, my old friend.

I have chased you
around the moons of Nibia...

...and around the Antares Maelstrom,
and around Perdition's flames.

<i>You keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in Next Generation.</i>

- It's a totally different set of characters.
- Silence.

How much longer must I wait
for my revenge?

If Wil Wheaton
and Stuart win their match...

...and we beat Lonely Larry and
Captain Sweatpants in the next round...

...we'll face off for championship.

So my path to satisfaction is blocked
by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.

Very well, they must be destroyed.

Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.

Silence.

So Penny tells me
you're working as a waitress...

...to put yourself through grad school.
That's great.

- What are you studying?
- Microbiology.

Oh, cool. So you could study me.

I don't understand.

Microbiology is the study
of tiny living things.

I know, I'm studying it.

Yeah, and I said you could study me
because I'm a tiny living thing.

- It's a joke.
- Are you sure?

- Do you like science fiction?
- No.

- Role-playing games?
- Like in the bedroom...

...or like Dungeons and Dragons?

- Either.
- No.

- You like...?
- It's gonna be a long night.

- Yeah, well, it's your fault.
- I had to ask, you didn't have to say yes.

You like magic?

- Not really.
- Okay.

Long, long night.

I play my Endless Serpent,
Raj will play Ecstatic Frenzy...

...which means Larry
will have to play Chaos Overlord.

Then Captain Sweatpants,
Molten River.

I play Nightshade Dryad.
Game, set and match.

Now fetch me Wil Wheaton.

Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold," in Klingon?

I believe so.

What is wrong with him?

Everyone has a different theory.

How about computers?
You like computers?

I use them. I don't like them.

Okay. Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?

A puppy once bit my face.

Of course it did.

- How about that? Einstein was wrong.
- What?

Approaching the speed of light doesn't
slow down time, approaching them does.

Excuse me.

Oh, damn. It's my mother.

- Are you going to answer it?
- I'm torn.

She might be dying and, you know,
wouldn't want to miss that.

On other hand, if let it go to voicemail,
I could play it over and over.

I know how you feel.
My mother makes me crazy.

Yeah, not as crazy
as my mother makes me.

Yeah? Does your mother call you
every day at work...

...to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

My mother calls me at work to see
if I had a healthy bowel movement.

Okay, does she lay out your clothes
for you in the morning...

...like you're 9 years old?

- You live with your mother?
- No. That's the sad part.

Rough. Okay, check this out.

My mother made me wear rubber gloves
to kindergarten...

...so I wouldn't pick up a disease
from the other children.

That's nothing.
I couldn't ride a bicycle...

...because my mother was afraid
I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.

Oh, wow, you didn't, did you?

Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.

A Corolla.

- More wine?
- I'd love some.

Listen, you have to come
to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.

Why?

A Catholic girl like you
wearing a big cross like that...

...might just give my mother the big
brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.

Okay, but only if you come to Sunday
dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.

It's a date.

Am I a matchmaker or what?

Lava Serpent.

Nest of Snakes.

- Underworld Guardian.
- Underworld Guardian.

We skirmish to the death.

- Invisibility Spell.
- Luminescence Spell.

- Water nymph.
- Fire demon.

- Two-headed tiger.
- Three-headed lion.

- Sulfur.
- Brimstone.

Problem, Wil Wheaton?

Hang on.

You're holding two moderate spell cards,
a Small Rock and a Potion of Zancor...

...which will be as much help as an
air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.

Your only move is to play the potion,
lose the skirmish...

...and two moves later, the game.

- I think he's got me.
- The year was 1995.

The place, Jackson, Mississippi.

Having spent 10 hours on a bus...

...during which I had
to twice violate my personal rule...

...against relieving myself
onboard a moving vehicle...

...I finally arrived at the
Fourth Annual Dixie Trek Convention...

...only to find that my idol,
Wil Wheaton...

...decided he had better things to do
than show up and sign my action figure.

What?

You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.

Now I have my revenge.

You went to the '95 Dixie Trek?

Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,
and I had to go to her funeral.

Your memaw died?

That's terrible.

Yeah. It was.

But I'm really sorry
that I disappointed you.

No, no, I understand.

If anything happened to my memaw,
I'd be one inconsolable Moon Pie.

I should clarify that statement
by explaining that she calls me Moon Pie.

It's a special relationship, isn't it?
Between a boy and his grandmother.

- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, okay.

Okay, great,
everybody loves their grandmas.

Now, come on, Sheldon,
finish him off.

Yeah. It's okay, Sheldon.
I let you down.

I deserve it.

Potion of Zancor.

What are you waiting for?

Kill Wil Wheaton.
From hell's heart, stab at him.

- I can't.
- Sure you can. Do it. Do it.

No.

I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who destroyed my dreams.

But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who loved his memaw.

- Enchanted Bunny.
- No!

Not Enchanted Bunny!

I call my memaw "nana."

And she's gonna be very happy
to hear...

...that my Small Rock
kills your Enchanted Bunny.

Game over, Moon Pie.

I don't understand.
Your grandmother's alive?

Oh, you catch on quick.

Come on, Stewie,
let's get our prize money.

That was fun.

Wheaton!

Wheaton!

- Kites ho!
- Kites ho!

Kites ho!

Kites ho!

Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho."

It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object.

As in, uh, "Land ho!"
or, uh, "Westward ho!"

Kites ho!

Hey, guys. What are you doing?

Going out to discover electricity?

If you refer to the work of Benjamin
Franklin, he did not discover electricity.

He merely used a kite to determine
that lightning consists of electricity.

He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

- Kites ho.
- We're heading out for some kite fighting.

- Kite fighting?
- Oh, yeah.

It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

Well, actually,
the risk of throat-cutting is very low.

On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

- Uh, you wanna come watch?
- Oh, gee, ha, sounds amazing.

But, um, I've got some friends
coming over.

We're just gonna watch
the Nebraska game.

Oh, football, sure.

Good guess.

I would've invited you,
but you're not a fan.

No. No, I'm not. So, great.

You've got plans
doing something you like...

...I've got plans doing something I like,
so it's good.

Maybe we'll hang out
after everybody's gone.

- Yeah, great.
- See you.

Well, this sucks.

I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off.

Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

Leonard realized Penny's hiding him
from her friends...

...because he's a tiny little man
who flies kites.

Oh, that certainly would suck.

Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.

Let out some string, add altitude,
I'll go under and cut his line.

Why wouldn't Penny
want her friends to meet me?

Focus, Leonard, focus.

The heat of battle is upon us.
The dogs of war are unleashed.

Maybe Koothrappali's right,
maybe I embarrass her.

You're embarrassing me.

A grown man worrying
about such nonsense.

We're in the middle of flying kites.

- Sorry.
- Sorry won't bring their kites down.

Ouch! String burn. String burn.

Oh, they think we're flanking.
They're playing right into our hands.

At the count of three,
we execute the flying scissor.

- One, two, thre...
- Whoa.

- You see that?
- See what?

- That chick. She smiled at me.
- No, she didn't.

- She did.
- Come on, scissors, scissors.

- Hold my line.
- What? I can't scissors by myself.

Howard, come back!

Victory!

Son of a bitch.

You're a sucky friend, you know that?

A sucky, sucky friend.

What was I supposed to do?
She gave me that come-hither look.

If she gave you any look at all,
it was a you-suck look.

I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds,
you don't have a hammy.

So Penny doesn't want me around her
friends. I embarrass her. What else?

Well, her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.

Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings...

...because she's scouting for a new mate
and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.

Oh, how kind of her.

Agreed. Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

A female bonobo will copulate with
a new male in front of the old one...

...without so much as a,
"How do you do?"

You always do this. Ditch me
for a woman you don't have a shot with.

- I totally had a shot.
- With a woman you were chasing in a park.

That's not a shot, that's a felony.

What's worse, it cost me
my prized Patang fighting kite.

I don't suppose there's any chance
you could give me my kite back?

I'm sorry, Raj,
but the rules of aerial warfare dictate...

...that the fallen kite go to the victor.

And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.

And without meaning, the following
would be an empty gesture:

<i>I have your kite, I have your kite</i>

- Hey.
- Hi.

How was your football party?

- It was pretty good, we won.
- Oh, wow, that's excellent.

Weird figure of speech, isn't it?

"We won,"
when you weren't actually playing.

<i>When we watch Star Wars, we don't say,
"W e defeated the Empire." Ha, ha.</i>

I'm glad to hear it.

Oh, hey, on a related subject...

...are you embarrassed
to have me around your friends?

Oh, my God, no.
Why would you ask that?

Well, you know, I just noticed
I haven't really met any of them.

- Sure you have.
- Well, yeah, no.

I met the huge ex-boyfriend...

...and the smaller-yet-still-larger-than-me
ex-boyfriend.

By the way, were they here today?

- Of course not.
- Why would they? Why would I ask?

Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

Leonard, look, if you wanna meet
my friends, that would be great.

I just... You know,
I didn't want you to be bored.

I wouldn't be bored.
Why would I be bored?

Well, because they're not
genius scientists.

Penny, I like all sorts of people.

In fact, some of my best friends
aren't geniuses.

Like who?

Okay, some of my Facebook friends
aren't geniuses.

But... My point is,
if we're gonna be a couple...

- ...I should be friends with your friends.
- Okay, great.

Why don't you come over next Saturday
and watch the game?

Another football game?

They have them every week.

Did not know that.

- You wanted to meet my friends.
- Sure.

Just...
I don't know much about football.

The guys' girlfriends
don't know football.

They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

Great.

<i>Looking left, he's got nothing.</i>

<i>- He drops off a screen, out of bounds...
- Okay, a completed pass.</i>

First down, New England.

- I think I'm starting to get this.
- Really?

The only thing I've learned is that
American men love drinking beer...

...pee too often,
and have trouble getting erections.

Focus on the game,
not the commercials, Raj.

If people cut back on the beer,
you could get out the bathroom...

...and satisfy your women
without pharmaceutical help.

Raj, what are you doing here?

You were supposed to help me
pimp out my Vespa.

Are you under the impression
that we're still friends?

Ugh.

Come on, you're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

It's not just the kite thing.

Every time we go someplace,
you dump me...

...whenever someone pretty comes
even though you don't have a shot.

I had a shot with that jogger.

Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

It's not a little scooter.

It's the second-biggest Vespa
they make!

You're watching football?

There's no fooling you.

Now, what is this "sacks" statistic
they put up there?

All I know about Saks
is my mother shops there.

Sacks, sacks.

It's football nomenclature
for when a quarterback...

...is tackled behind the line
of scrimmage.

Huh.

Scrimmage.

The line of scrimmage
is the imaginary transverse line...

...separating the offense
from the defense.

Oh.

Sheldon knows football?

- Apparently.
- I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?

- Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
- I grew up in Texas.

Football is ubiquitous in Texas.

There's pro football, college football,
high school football, peewee football...

In fact, every form of football
except the original, European football.

Which most Texans believe
to be a commie plot.

- Unbelievable.
- If interested...

...I also know all about frying meat
that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.

So you could teach me?

Football or chicken-fried meats?

Football. I'm going to Penny's
to watch a game with her friends.

I don't wanna look like an idiot.
I wanna blend in.

If you wanna blend in...

...I'd think looking like an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

Sheldon, teach me football.
It'll be fun.

That's exactly what my father said.

"Come to the games.
Watch the games."

Week in and week out,
from the time I was 5...

...until I went off to college.
Longest seven years of my life.

Please, I'm asking you as a friend.

Are you making this
a tier-one friendship request?

- Yes.
- Fine.

- I really appreciate this.
- Yeah, yeah.

All right, poindexter,
sit down, shut up and listen.

I'm sorry?

Oh, that's how my father
always began our football conversations.

And if you'd like, after the game,
I'll teach you...

...how to shoot close enough
to a raccoon that it craps itself.

When are you gonna stop
making Cylon toast?

When I have enough to destroy
the human toast...

...on the Battlestar
known as Galactica.

Is that what you're wearing
to watch football?

- What's wrong with a football jersey?
- Nothing.

That, however,
appears to be a football cocktail dress.

It's the smallest size they had.

Except the one for dogs.

I can't believe they had one for dogs.

Oh, yes. Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.

Cats, however,
refuse to wear sporting apparel.

My sister found that out the hard way.

- Anyway, wish me luck.
- Leonard, wait.

Am I correct in assuming
that your attempt...

...to be accepted by Penny's peers
is based on your desire to ensure...

...your continuing mating privileges
with her?

Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way.

How would you put it?

Yeah, okay, like you said.

Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse.

Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

By the way, another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

Goodbye, Sheldon.

Now, hold on.

I believe that social convention dictate
you not arrive empty-handed.

Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?

Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.

What's funny about Cylon toast?

It's open.

Hey, pal.

What do you want?

I brought you a little gift.

New kite.

The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang.

An Indian kite my brother sent
to me from New Delhi.

It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

This is Hello Kitty.

Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

Does a Patang?

Wow, you just don't get it, do you?

Buying me something pretty isn't gonna
make our problem just go away.

Look, I admit I haven't always been
the best friend I could be.

You've been a sucky friend.
A sucky, sucky friend.

- Stipulated.
- And you do it all the time.

Last week, we were looking for a phone
with giant numbers for your mother...

- ...and I realize you're not even there.
- I know.

And where were you?

Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick.

But in my defense, she was gorgeous.

And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade...

...going up and down
and up and down...

It was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court.

You're impossible.

Hey, at least I can talk to women
without being drunk.

Excuse me, I have selective mutism,
a recognized medical disorder.

You're just a douche.

No. You know what?

Maybe that's what this whole thing
is about.

You're not mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

No, I'm mad at you.
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

Look, fine. You're mad at me. I get it.
Now...

How about we go
spend the day together?

Just the two of us.
We'll go anywhere you want.

I don't know.

Come on.

Let me take you someplace nice.

I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

Really? Now?
With the traffic and the parking? It...

Okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let's go.

Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

- Yeah.
- Ha-ha-ha.

<i>- Breaks tackle.
- Go, go.</i>

<i>- He breaks another.
- Go! Yes!</i>

Are you people watching this?
Is this amazing or what?

Sweetie, that's a highlight
from the '98 championship game.

Oh. Did not know that. Ha.

- How much beer have you had?
- None, why?

Oh. Just kind of hoping you were drunk.

- Now we're back live.
- Okay, yeah.

No, I can see the difference.

- That's intentional grounding.
- Totally.

Yeah...
That completely was a forward pass...

...which they threw intentionally
incomplete to avoid loss of yardage...

...or to conserve time.

I can't believe they're not penalized
with the loss of a down...

...and by having to move the line of
scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.

- Here. Have some pizza, sweetie.
- Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.

I know.
I just need you to stop talking.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

- Sheldon, come in.
- Thank you.

I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

- There's some in the fridge.
- You shouldn't keep bread in the fridge.

Staleness is caused
by crystallization of the starch...

...which occurs faster
at cool temperatures.

On Earth, we say, "Thank you."

So, Leonard, how goes the mimesis?

- Mimesis?
- You know, mimesis.

An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties...

...of a specific object or organism.

Mimesis.

What the hell are you talking about?

I'm attempting
to communicate with you...

...without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

Let me try again.

Have the indigenous fauna
accepted you as one of their own?

Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

Oh, I guess so.

Good. Oh, FYI,
after I eat my sandwich...

...I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite
out for a test run.

Would you get your Delta Wing Raptor
and join me?

I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon.
Come on, we're watching football here.

I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.

A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach
has thrown down a red flag...

...indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

Hope he's right, because if he's not,
it'll cost him one of his three timeouts.

You know, Leonard, honey...

...I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

I'll watch the end of the game.
There's three minutes left.

Until halftime.

This is just half?

We've been here for hours.

- You're gonna be here for a couple more.
- Oh, you're kidding.

- No.
- Nice meeting all of you.

So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

He is really smart.

I really like my saber-toothed cat.
Thank you.

My pleasure.

Maybe after lunch we can go
to Marie Callender's and have some pie.

- I'd like that.
- Heh.

This is turning out to be
a perfect Saturday.

Good, I'm glad.

Oh, man. Did you see the way
she smiled at me?

Fine. Go ahead.

No. This is our day.

If you wanna chase after her,
chase after her.

Oh, who am I kidding? I wouldn't
have a shot with a girl like that.

Don't put yourself down.
You're very attractive.

- You think so?
- Yeah.

It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class
with me now and then...

...but you have a certain wiry appeal.

Yeah, well, it doesn't matter,
because she wasn't really smiling at me.

In this case, I think she was.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Bye.

What a douche.

Wow, Sheldon, cannot believe
you made up your own game.

Oh. Research Lab is more than a game.

It's like the slogan says:

"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

We must not be playing it right.

All right. Five.
One, two, three, four, five.

Oh, wow, look at that.

My Department of Defense
research grant is renewed.

Oh. Great roll.

Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron...

...and build the large hadron collider.

Yay.

You're a natural at this, Penny.

And as the first beta testers,
you two have quite the edge...

...when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

Oh, gee, Sheldon,
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

Why not?

Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you. Penny?

I have to pick up my friend Justin
from the airport.

There you go.
She has to pick up her friend Justin.

And I can't play
because I'm going with her. Right?

Uh, yeah, if you want.
There may not be room.

He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars
and amplifiers.

Wait. What are you talking about?

My friend Justin.

Pay attention, Leonard.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

- Who is this Justin?
- Your turn.

- I told you about him.
- Roll the dice.

Yeah. My friend from Omaha,
plays the guitar.

He's coming
looking for session work.

So I told him
he could crash on my couch.

Come on. Roll a six, Penny dies horribly
in a nuclear meltdown.

See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

Hang on. Some guy
is gonna be sleeping on your couch?

He's not some guy. He's my friend.

So by friend, do you mean
"friend" friend...

...gay friend, or "ex-boyfriend
you're now platonic with...

...but still might have a thing for you"
friend?

Well, he's definitely not gay.

Oh. A definitely-not-gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

Yippie.

Okay, we went out a little bit
a long time ago.

But we were never, like, going out.

Okay. Not to be pedantic,
the last I checked...

..."went out" was the past tense
of "going out"...

...which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism...

...for saw each other naked.

I'll just roll for you.

You have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

What was your first clue?

Uh-oh. Industrial accident.

Know what?
Don't talk to me like an idiot.

I'm not talking to you like an idiot.
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic.

"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon
laser. Lose one turn and a retina."

How's that not talking to me
like I'm an idiot?

It's my friend, it's my couch
and it's my freaking life.

It's also your roll.

You know what? It is your life.

If you wanna have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch, fine!

Why don't you just rent bunk beds
and invite the Black Eyed Peas?

Hey, if I wanna invite the line-up
of Lollapalooza to my apartment, I will.

It's none of your business.

Do you know how childish you sound
right now?

- Oh, now I'm a child. Not an idiot anymore.
- Hey, the two aren't mutually exclusive.

Oh, you are such a...

- What the hell is he doing?
- Drowning us out. He doesn't like fighting.

Sheldon, just stop.
Look, the fight is over.

Oh, and FYI. You never even heard
of the Black Eyed Peas...

...until you met me.

I heard of them.

I didn't know they were a band.

Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

No, we just had a little spat.

Look on the bright side.
As a result of Penny's forfeit...

...you have become
the world's first winner of Research Lab.

Would you like a commemorative
snow cone?

I don't get how she can just announce...

...that an old boyfriend is gonna sleep
on her couch.

Hey, I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

I don't wanna play a game, Sheldon.

It's called Scientists.
Now, I will name three scientists...

...you'll put them in order of the size
of their contribution to their fields.

To make this game
even more compelling...

...you must consider only the
contribution of the man to the field...

...not the validity of the field itself.

For example,
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan...

...made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy...

...than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

Okay. Ready to have some fun?

An old boyfriend
who's "definitely not gay."

You know, that's what a guy
likes to hear. "Definitely."

All right, I'll start with an easy one.

Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy.

Hint. Madame Curie had her husband
to help her.

What am I supposed to say?

"Sure, Penny. I'm cool with your old
boyfriend sleeping in your apartment."

"It doesn't matter if you're cool or not.

Because I'm Penny, I'm pretty
and I can do whatever I want."

"You think you're doing
a favor by being in a relationship with me."

"No. I'm doing you
a favor by being in the same room as you."

Leonard, stop the car.

What?

I can't listen to the two of you fight
anymore.

- Come on. We're late.
- Calm down. We'll make the movie.

I believe my alarm is appropriate.
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard.

Plus, skip the concession stand
and pre-show urination.

Oh, dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

Go. Go, Power Rangers, go.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- We're, uh, going to the movies.
- No, we're not.

We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

Hang on.

<i>They're showing a digital Time Bandits.
You wouldn't wanna come, would you?</i>

Not really, no.

All right. Invitation pointlessly offered,
declined as expected.

Everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

Just give us a minute?

Take all the time you need.

So are we gonna talk about last night?

- Are you ready to apologize?
- No.

Ehh! Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

Come on. This is stupid.

Oh, there it is again.
You think I'm stupid.

No. There's a difference
between being and acting stupid.

Oh, yeah? Well, there's a difference
between being a jerk and being an ass.

No, there isn't. They're synonyms.

Well, that was rather unpleasant.

Yeah. I don't think I need
my pre-show urination anymore.

Leonard, when that woman moved in
three years ago...

...I told you not to talk to her.
Now look, we are late for the movies.

<i>Hey, look Amazing Spider-Man 193.</i>

Got it.

Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight...

...and then his girlfriend breaks up
with him.

You want me to get it for you?
It will help take your mind off things.

Hey, guys. What's going on?

Ah, we need to kill a couple hours
until the next showing.

Oh, well, no problem.

I was thinking of closing early,
and going home...

...but let's face it, that's just a smaller
lonely room filled with comic books.

Thanks, Stuart.

Let me ask you.

Do you think it's okay to have
an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?

- She's obviously way out of line.
- Thank you.

But if she dumps you,
she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow...

...and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

So the only question is,
how long until you fold?

I am not gonna fold.

Well, excuse me. I don't think
Penny's out of line. You don't own her.

It's like my girl Beyoncé says:

"If you like it,
you should've put a ring on it."

At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it...

- ...she should've backed off.
- Like when a guy's upset...

...his friend agreed to take a class
with him and then doesn't...

...because he's doing a juice fast
with his mother?

I didn't know you were upset
about that.

Really? Did you miss the subtle indicators?
Like me saying, "Howard, I am upset."

- Okay, sorry.
- Maybe it's different in this country.

Back in India, it means you're upset
with a guy named Howard.

- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make up for the fact...

...I had to make chicken and rice
with this vegan guy.

Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice.

You think I was having fun? Sitting
around listening to my mother say:

"Have you ever
peed so much in your life?"

Oh, my God.
You are such a mama's boy.

- Don't bring my mother into this!
- You brought your mother into this!

Stop it! Both of you!

This fighting, I might as well be back
with my parents.

"I told you if you didn't
quit drinking, I'd leave you."

"I guess that makes you a liar.
I'm drunk as hell and you're still here."

"Stop yelling.
You're making Sheldon cry."

"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry.

That I let you name him Sheldon."

Boy, what got him so upset?

Oh, sure. You can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

Oh. Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

With the other half of my tip.

Hey, Sheldon.
What're you doing here?

This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime.

I'd think as a waitress you'd be familiar
with the paradigm.

- Is Leonard coming?
- No.

I believe Leonard is waiting for you
to come back to him and apologize.

- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- I assumed that.

- Hence my true purpose in coming here.
- Which is?

I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

- I'm busy.
- Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.

- Fine. What do you want?
- I have a few questions.

First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half sandwich.

- Yes.
- Where exactly...

...does the half-sandwich come from?

Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich?

Or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

No. Sheldon, they just make
a half sandwich.

You can't make a half sandwich.

If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

Okay, fine.
It's soup and a small sandwich.

- Is that what you want?
- Of course not. I'll have my usual.

- Great.
- Aren't you gonna ask...

- ...if I want a beverage?
- Usually lemonade?

- Yes.
- Want lemonade?

- Yes.
- Anything else?

Yes. I want you to apologize to Leonard.

I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing. He's overreacting.

Irrelevant. The disruption in your
relationship is making my life intolerable.

Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

I don't follow.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

<i>All right. Let's assume ad arguendum,
that in this case Leonard is wrong.</i>

- Leonard is wrong.
- Considering the transgressions...

...you committed
that he's overlooked...

...don't you think that
you could return the favor?

I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon.

What do you mean
transgressions I've committed?

Were you under the impression that
Leonard has no complaints about you?

Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you.

You're making a check sign in the air.
Got it. Just hold your horses.

- What does Leonard complain about?
- Your driving.

The stuffed animals on your bed...

...that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

Your constant tardiness, your singing.

- My singing?
- That's from my list.

Leonard'd be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

Okay, if Leonard has problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

According to him, you're over-sensitive
and have a temper.

Oh, really? Well, then do me a favor
and tell Leonard that he can drop dead.

And she wonders
why she's constantly under-tipped.

- Hey.
- Oh, good, you're home.

- I need you to do me a favor.
- Sure.

- Go apologize to Penny.
- What?

Right now would be good.

- Leonard!
- A few minutes ago would've been better.

I hear you don't like my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

Who would tell you
something like that?

Why would you tell her
something like that?

It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?

Okay, yeah, it's true.
But I can live with that stuff.

What I can't live with
is you casually informing me...

...some guy is gonna be staying
without asking me first.

That isn't even your problem.
Problem is you don't trust me.

Oh, come on.

Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

Sheldon? Where did he go?

Ugh. Your yelling must've
freaked him out again.

Where are you going? You just walk away
in the middle of an argument?

No. I'm gonna find your roommate...

...before he hurts himself
trying to cross the street or something.

Why didn't you say so?

Now I need your permission
for that too?

I can't read your mind, Penny.

Really? Why not?
You're so smart and I'm so dumb!

Raj. Raj. Raj.

Stop knocking. It's open.

Please tell my parents
that our dark matter research...

...is at a critical juncture. I can't come
for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

<i>Ask our son what we're supposed
to say to Mr. and Mrs. Chaudri...</i>

<i>...whose daughter, Lakshmi, Is flying In
for the sole purpose of meeting him.</i>

I didn't ask you to set me up.

<i>- You should be thanking us.
- Yes, Lakshmi got her stomach stapled.</i>

<i>You have an opportunity
to get in with her...</i>

<i>...before she loses weight
and her self-esteem goes up.</i>

I don't care.

And why don't you think
I can find a woman for myself?

<i>You're 27, the closest thing
we have...</i>

<i>...to a daughter-in-law
Is that Jewish boy, Howard.</i>

Oh, that is completely below the belt.

Sheldon, tell my parents
that Howard and I are just friends.

Sheldon?

Howard and I are just friends.

Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

Sheldon.

What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

Hey, why don't you just let me find him...

...while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

- What stop sign?
- Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!

Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!

I'm busy too! You answer it!

I can't! I'm on the toilet!

God's sake, I don't need to hear that!

Can't you just say, "I'm busy?"

I said, "I'm busy,"
but that wasn't good enough for you!

I hope it's one
of those home invasion deals...

...and they shoot me in the head.

Well, if it's a home
invader, don't tell them I'm on the toilet!

There's no one there.

You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady.

Hey, Stuart. Have you seen Sheldon?

Yeah.
He's, uh, over in the graphic novel section.

Built himself a little nest.

Thank you.

- Uh, Penny.
- Yeah?

- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard
are having a fight.

Oh, yeah, kind of. It's no big thing.

Oh, good. Good.

I love you.

I'm not leaving until you talk to me.

- Hey, what's going on?
- It's a little hard to explain.

He pretends
he's in an alternate dimension...

...that occupies the same physical space
we're in, but he can't perceive us.

Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.

All right, come on, Sheldon,
let's go home. We're done fighting.

I've heard that before.

Then the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom...

...blaring a Richard Feynman lecture,
Mom shouting Jesus would forgive her...

...if she put ground glass
in my dad's meat loaf.

And my dad's on the roof skeet shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

Okay, there's gonna be no more shouting
and no skeet shooting.

Really? Where's your friend Justin
going to sleep?

- Yeah, where is he gonna sleep?
- Oh, my God, would you let this go?

I'd let it go.

Why should I let it go? Why don't you
just tell the guy to find a place to sleep?

Oh, for God sakes.

So you have childhood issues.

We all have childhood issues.

At some point, you just need to grow up
and get past them.

<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

Leonard, let me handle this. Please?

<i>- Fire, fire.
- Look, let... She...</i>

Sheldon, please try and understand.

Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship
and occasionally we're gonna fight.

But no matter what happens
between us, we will always love you.

Right, Leonard?

Always is a long time.

Sure. Always.

You know, how about we buy you
this robot and then we all go home?

I want that one.

Okay, you can have that one.

Oh, come on.
He's just gonna play with it twice...

...and then it'll end up in his closet
with all the other junk.

Buy him the robot, Leonard.

- Can I get this comic book too?
- Yes, you can.

We meet again.

So, what did Justin say when you told him
he couldn't sleep on your couch?

He's a musician.
He'll sleep in his own vomit if he has to.

I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot.

How much time do we have?

Uh, T-minus five hours,
37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.

Okay, our position
is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west.

That means the azimuth
should be 168.22 degrees...

...relative to magnetic north
with an elevation of 49.93.

- Anything yet?
- Uh, we have a signal...

- ...but no frame lock.
- Hang on. How about now?

We did it. Ha, ha.
We have the West Coast feed of HBO.

<i>Ooh, Real Sex.</i>

Big deal. Every time I watch that...

...it's old women putting condoms
on cucumbers.

All right,
let's see what's on the East Coast feed.

<i>Oh, hey. Dune.</i>

Not a great movie,
but look at that beautiful desert.

Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.

It's just not the same without him.

That was good. That was good.

<i>Oh, this sucks.
I'm switching back to Real Sex.</i>

Sheldon's log.

Stardate 63345.3.

While my colleagues are off
observing the Leonid meteor shower...

...I've remained behind
to complete my paper...

...on the decays
of highly excited massive string states.

Although my research is going well...

...I do miss the warmth
of human companionship.

And good evening to you, Siam Palace.

This is Sheldon Cooper.

I'm going to be dining alone
this evening...

...so I'll be reducing my usual order.

I'd like to start with one quarter
of the Assorted Appetizers Plate...

...and one half
of the Golden Treasure for two...

Oh, for heaven's sake.
In the mid-18th century...

...King Rama IV of Siam
divided a huge empire...

...amongst the colonial powers of Europe
to preserve his throne.

Surely you, his cultural descendant,
can handle pad thai and dumplings.

Sheldon, help!

I need to go, but you keep in mind...

...that my sharply worded comments
on Yelp.com...

...recently took down
a local muffin store.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Come in! Hurry!

- Penny?
- I'm back here.

Penny. Penny. Penny.

Oh, for God's sakes, I'm in the bathroom.

Shall I come back at a better time?

Get in here!

Hurry!

Don't you dare knock.

Hello.

I slipped in the shower.
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

Not surprising.

You have no safety mat
or adhesive stickers...

...to allow for purchase on a surface
with a low coefficient of static friction.

What?

Tubs are slippery.

I know. I slipped.

I have a series of whimsical duck stickers
on the bottom of my tub.

Whatever. Will you just
turn the water off and help me up?

- They're holding umbrellas.
- Unh.

- What?
- The ducks in my tub.

Unh. Uh-huh.

They're whimsical,
because ducks have neither a need for...

...nor the ability to use umbrellas.

Oh, my God.
I gotta go to the emergency room.

Assuming you're correct
that your humerus...

...is no longer seated
in the glenoid socket, I would think so.

- Can you drive me?
- I don't drive.

Well, I can't drive.

Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.

Ow!

I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

No, no, no, I can't wait that long.
You gotta help me. Please?

All right. Let it never be said
that Sheldon Lee Cooper...

...ignored the pleas
of a damsel in distress.

No one's saying that. Let's go.

It does seem rather ironic that
for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks...

...we both might die in a fiery car crash.

I wish Penny didn't have to work.
She loves camping.

That would've been great.
You and Penny having sex in the tent...

...while I sit out here
and watch Howard hump a cactus.

Okay, the best I can tell,
there are eight other campsites nearby.

Mostly science nerds like us,
but just over yon ridge...

...are two not unattractive
middle-school teachers...

...who reek of desperation.

- Wonderful. How old are they?
- I don't know, 50, 55?

Oh, menopause. Heh.

Nature's birth control.

Come on. You guys can't be that hard up.

- I am.
- Yeah, me too.

Look, they gave me homemade cookies.

Of course they did.
That's what grandmothers do.

- So, what are we waiting for?
- Relax.

I said we'd stop by a little later,
after they have their nap.

- Good idea. They'll be refreshed.
- Yeah.

- Cookie?
- Thank you.

Mmm.

- Mm. Not bad.
- Yeah, very tasty.

Tell me more about these teachers.

Not much to tell.
They had a VW Microbus...

...and were wearing
tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirts.

Huh. Hm.

Good cookies.

I see no organizational system
in here whatsoever.

Which panties do you wear on Mondays?

I don't need panties.
I just need shorts and a shirt.

Mother always told me
one should wear clean underpants...

- ...in case one is in an accident.
- One was already in an accident.

Doesn't mean one won't be in another,
especially if I drive.

- Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes.
- Okay.

- Here.
- Seriously? Those shorts with that top?

All right.

No.

No.

Oh, that's cute.

We should have you checked
for a concussion.

Okay, now you gotta help me
put these on.

- All right.
- But don't look.

- Don't look?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

Oh. Well, that's understandable.

You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking...

...is well established
in heroic mythology.

Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa...

- ...Orpheus and Eurydice...
- Great.

They always look. It never ends well.

You gotta help me
get my arm into the sleeve.

Okay.

Is that my arm?

Doesn't feel like an arm.

Then maybe you should let it go.

Alrighty.

Stars are pretty, aren't they?

Up above the world so high.

Like little diamonds in the sky.

That's beautiful, dude.

You should write that down
before someone steals it.

So when do the meteors get here?

The meteors don't get here.
The Earth is moving into their path.

I can feel it.

I can feel the Earth moving. Heh.

It's moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.

Okay, how's that?

Better, thanks.

Stars are pretty, aren't they?

What's so funny?

It's your American accent. Everything
you say sounds stupid. Ha-ha-ha.

"Stars are pretty, aren't they?"

For the record, I should let you know...

...this is my first time
driving an actual motor vehicle.

- You have your learner's permit, right?
- Yes.

And I've logged a considerable number
of hours on a simulator.

- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

- All right. Can we go?
- One moment.

According to my Driver's Ed book,
the side mirror is properly adjusted...

...when a portion of the driver's door
handle is visible in the lower right corner.

There's the handle. Back. Too far.

Bringing it back.

Optimized. Ahem.

Now, where is the switch
to adjust the passenger-side mirror?

It's right there.

Where is the passenger-side mirror?

In a parking lot in Hollywood.

- Now, can we please go?
- Yes. Soon as I adjust my seat.

Whee!

Oh, dear. I'm gonna have to start again.

If I could speak the language of rabbits...

...they would be amazed
and I would be their king.

I hate my name.

It has "nerd" in it.

Leon-nerd.

I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.

I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

At first.

You know what's a cool name?

Angelo.

That has "angel" and "Jell-O" in it.

It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.

We were all back
at my Aunt Barbara's house.

Our eyes locked over the pickled herring.

We never meant for it to happen.

One day, I hold a great ball
for the president of France.

But the rabbits,
they hate me and don't come.

I'm embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce
in the world and make them watch.

People could call me Angie.

"Yo, Angie. How's it going?"

To this day,
I can't look at pickled herring...

...without being aroused and ashamed.

Oh, cousin Jeanie.

Could you please drive a little faster?

Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast.

- What's that?
- Nothing.

- The engine does that sometimes.
- It can't be nothing.

The "check engine" light is on.
We need a service station.

The light's been on
since I bought the car.

All the more reason to consult
with a mechanic before it explodes.

It's not gonna explode. Just keep driving.

Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

<i>Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise.</i>

He was the science officer.

<i>I guarantee that if he saw the Enterprise's
"check engine" light blinking...</i>

...he would
pull the ship over immediately.

Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.

Oop. Red light. Release accelerator...

...and slowly apply the brake.

Nailed it.

While we have a moment...

- ...may I ask you a question?
- What?

Why do you have
the Chinese character for "soup"...

...tattooed on your right buttock?

- It's not "soup." It's "courage."
- No, it isn't.

I suppose it does take courage...

...to demonstrate
that kind of commitment to soup.

How did you see it?
You said you wouldn't look.

Sorry. As I told you,
the hero always peeks.

- Anything?
- No, that was the last pudding cup.

No.

What about Slim Jims?

That's what he used
to eat his pudding, remember?

Right. That was so good.

Sweetie and meaty at the same time.

Wait, wait, wait.
So you're saying we're out of food?

The only thing in here are blue-ice packs.

I know they're poison...

...but they look like
big, yummy Otter Pops.

- Oh, God, I am so hungry.
- Me too.

Check and see
if we have any more pudding.

Okay.

All right. There's no need to bark at me.

According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk...

...you're after the man who claims
to be having a heart attack...

...but appears to be well enough
to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.

We have to fill these out.

"Describe illness or injury."

I dislocated my shoulder.

All right.

And "how did the accident occur?"

You already know that.

Cause of accident:
lack of adhesive ducks.

Okay, medical history.

- Have you been diagnosed with diabetes?
- No.

- Kidney disease?
- No.

- Migraines?
- Getting one.

- Are you currently pregnant?
- No.

Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.

Change migraine to "yes."

- "When was your last menstrual period?"
- Oh, next question.

I'll put "in progress."

Okay. Moving to psychiatric disorders.

"List all major behavioral diagnoses,
e.g. depression, anxiety, etc."

What the hell does this have to do
with my stupid shoulder?

Episodes of sub-psychotic rage.

- Ass.
- Possible Tourette's.

All right.
"Moles, lesions or other skin conditions."

"Soup" tattoo on right buttock.

Okay, Sheldon. Sheldon, look.
I am scared and in a lot of pain.

Could you please take a break
from being you for just a minute...

...and try being,
I don't know, comforting?

Ahem. I'm sorry.

There, there.

Everything's going to be fine.

Sheldon's here.

Thanks. That's much better.

Oh, I'm so hungry.

Will you shut up? We're all hungry.

Okay, our objective
is the Boy Scout campsite to the east.

Easy target. Big, doughy scoutmaster,
couple of Cubs, mostly Webelos.

What kind of score?

Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.
I mean, it's a freaking 7-Eleven.

- All right. Everyone grab flashlights.
- Okay.

Oh, my God. Could it be? Yes!

My mother put an "I love you" brisket
in my backpack!

- Quick, get forks.
- Don't need forks.

It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.

- He's right.
- Yes.

I feel like
we're forgetting something important.

Me too, but what?

Maybe a Tupperware bowl
of roasted potatoes and carrots?

LEONARD & RAJESH:
Yes!

Yes!

Now remember...

...you were given powerful
pain medication and a muscle relaxer...

...so don't operate heavy machinery.

Try not to choke on your own drool.

Wait. You have to help me get into bed.

Sheldon has to get me into bed.

Bet you never thought I'd say that.
Ha-ha-ha.

Yes.

The charm of your drug-addled candor
knows no bounds.

You know, people think
you're this weird robot man...

...who's so annoying all the time,
and you totally are.

<i>But then it's like that movie Wall-E
at the end.</i>

You're so full of love
and you can save a plant...

...and get fat people
out of the floaty chairs.

That's a fairly labored metaphor,
but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.
You're not sick.

Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

Wait, wait. Let's sing it as a round.

I'll start.

<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

See, that's where you come in.
I'll start over.

<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

I've got all night, Sheldon.

<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

<i>- Little ball of fur
- Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

<i>- Little ball of fur
- Happy kitty, sleepy kitty</i>

<i>- Happy kitty, sleepy kitty
- Purr, purr, purr</i>

<i>Purr, purr, purr</i>

And the next morning when he woke up,
he rolled over and realized...

Da, da, da!

- -she was his cousin.

That's still not funny.

"That's still not funny."

And she was my second cousin.

"And she was my second cousin."

You're a real douche.

Who cares? You slept with your cousin.

So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

Guy opens it, and there is the snail...

...who says,
"What the heck was all that about?"

I don't really get it.

Well, see, it took two years
for the snail to...

Not important.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

Where do you think this is going?

To be honest,
I was hoping at least second base.

You're so funny.

You're like a standup comedian.

A Jewish standup comedian,
that would be new.

Actually, I think a lot of them
are Jewish.

No, I was just... Because... Never mind.

Look, Howard, this is our third date,
and we both know what that means.

- We do?
- Sex.

You're kidding.

But I need to know whether
you're looking for a relationship...

...or a one-night stand.

Okay, just to be clear,
there's only one correct answer, right?

I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish?"
on an airplane?

Maybe you need to think about it
a little.

Well, you know, it's not unheard of...

...for a one-night stand
to turn into a relationship.

Call me when you figure it out.

Three dates means sex?

Who knew?

Greetings, homeys.

Homette.

Why are you back from your date
so early?

Well, in romance, as in show business,
always leave them wanting more.

- What exactly does that mean?
- He struck out.

Hey, did you know
that three dates with the same woman...

...is the threshold for sex?

Actually, I've never had three dates
with the same woman.

With Penny and me, it took two years.

But now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

Okay, well,
before you and Penny hooked up...

...did she ask
for any kind of commitment?

No, she was pretty clear
about wanting to keep her options open.

I have something to announce,
but out of respect for convention...

...I will wait for you
to finish your conversation.

What are you talking about?

The cultural paradigm in which
people have sex after three dates.

I see.

Now, are we talking "date"
the social interaction...

...or "date" the dried fruit?

Never mind.
What's your announcement?

Oh, good, my turn.

Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted
you to be among the first to know...

I hear you're gonna be on the radio...

<i>...with Ira Flatow from Science Friday
next week.</i>

Thank you, Kripke...

...for depriving me of the opportunity
to share my news with my friends.

My pleasure.

- My thank-you was not sincere.
- But my pleasure is.

Let me ask you a question.

At what point
did National Public Radio...

...have to start scraping the bottom
of the barrel for its guests?

Eeh-eeh. Don't answer. It's rhetorical.

Well, why are you such a stupidhead?

That is also rhetorical.

I'm sorry you had to hear that.

Are you really gonna be on NPR?

Yes, they're interviewing me by phone
from my office...

...regarding the recent so-called discovery
of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.

It's pledge week, and they're trying
to goose the ratings with controversy.

- Very cool. Congratulations.
- Thank you. My mother is very excited.

She's convening her Bible study group
to listen in...

...and then pray for my soul.

I was on the radio once.

I called into Fever 104 FM New Delhi...

...and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

"Fever 104:"

That means "Fever 104:
Home of the really good current music."

It's much catchier in Hindi.

All right, these are the talking points
for my NPR interview tomorrow.

I need to make
sure they're simple enough...

...for the less educated in the audience
to understand.

Howard, look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

I have a Master's in engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It required the completion of 144 units
of grad work and an original thesis.

Yes.

Look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

You know, when Sheldon gives you
homework, you don't have to do it.

In fact, it's better if you don't.
Otherwise, the rest of us look bad.

- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

Yo, Raj, talk to me.

I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

Hey, Howard,
why haven't you called Bernadette?

Did she say something?

Said she hasn't heard from you.
I thought you liked her.

I do, you know,
but she wants a commitment...

...and I'm not sure she's my type.

She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?

Look, Bernadette is really nice.

I just always thought when I finally
settled down into a relationship...

...it would be with someone,
you know, different.

Different how?

<i>Well, you know, more like Megan Fox
from Transformers...</i>

<i>...or Katee Sackhoff
from Battlestar Galactica.</i>

Are you high?

<i>You'd have a better shot with the
three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.</i>

Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.
Anyway, that movie was 20 years ago.

Imagine how saggy
those things would be.

You're gonna throw away a great girl
like Bernadette...

...because you're holding out
for some fantasy?

Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

Excuse me, I'm sitting here.

Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

I mean, obviously, he isn't
the kind of guy I usually go out with.

You know, physically.

Again, I'm right here.

I do not judge a book by its cover.
I am interested in the person underneath.

I am here, right? You see me?

Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people too.

But, you know, why is it wrong
to want those insides wrapped up...

...in, say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

Yes, you're delicious caramel too.

I will tell you why it's wrong...

- Excuse me, may I interject?
- What?

Biologically speaking,
Howard is perfectly justified...

...in seeking out the optimum mate
for the propagation of his genetic line.

Thank you, Sheldon.

Whether that propagation
is in the interest of humanity...

...is an entirely different question.

<i>This is Ira Flatow and
you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.</i>

<i>Joining us today by phone
from his office In Pasadena, California...</i>

<i>...Is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</i>

Oh, this is gonna be a riot.

<i>Thanks for being with us today,
Dr. Cooper.</i>

My pleasure, Ira.

<i>Now, let's talk
about magnetic monopoles.</i>

<i>Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole Is?</i>

Of course.

First, consider an ordinary magnet,
which has, as even the most uneducated...

...in your audience must know, two poles...

...a north and south pole.

If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets...

...each with its own north
and south pole.

<i>Dr. Cooper, I think there might be
something wrong with our connection.</i>

No, I hear you fine.

As I was saying,
an ordinary magnet has two poles.

The primary characteristic
of a monopole...

...is that it has only one pole,
hence, "monopole."

<i>A requirement for string theory,
or M-theory, If you will...</i>

<i>...is the existence of such monopoles.</i>

<i>I myself led an expedition to the
Arctic Circle In search of said particles.</i>

<i>Kripke, I found the nozzle.
I'm going to kill you.</i>

So nice you could join me this evening.
You're looking lovely as always.

Thanks, Howard.

Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

Come on, Katee,
don't make it sound so cheap.

I'm sorry. Fiddling with yourself
in the bathtub is a real class act.

Thank you.

So, ahem, shall we get started?

Sure, but can I ask you
a question first?

You wanna play Cylon and colonist?

No, I wanna know why
you're playing make-believe with me...

...when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

- You mean Bernadette?
- No, I mean Princess Leia.

Of course I mean Bernadette.

She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

- I know, but she's not you.
- I'm not me.

The real me is in Beverly Hills
with a tall, handsome rich guy.

- Really? Tall?
- Six-four.

Ouch.

You've got a wonderful girl in your life,
and you're ignoring her...

...to spend your nights in the bathtub
with a mental image and a washcloth.

Howard!

What are you doing in there?

I'm taking a bath!

I hope that's all you're doing!
We share that tub!

Don't remind me!

Oh, man.

All soaped up and no place to go.

How you doing, buddy?

I was humiliated on national radio.
How do you think I'm doing?

Come on, it wasn't that bad.

What do you want?

We represent
the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.

- Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
- It wasn't funny.

I thought it was funny.

- Raj.
- You laughed.

Did you laugh?

I fell on the floor.

All right, he got you.
You can get him back.

- I refuse to sink to his level.
- You can't sink.

With all that helium in you,
you're lucky you don't float away.

Are you really admitting defeat?

- I never admit defeat.
- Good.

However, on an unrelated topic,
I'm never getting out of this bed again.

What if you could make Kripke
look even sillier than he made you look?

- I don't think that's possible.
- You're not helping.

I didn't come to help. I came to mock.

Sheldon, what you need to do...

...is figure out a way
to exact vengeance on Kripke, like...

Like how the Joker got back at Batman...

...for putting him in the Arkham Asylum
for the Criminally Insane.

He didn't stay and talk about his feelings
with the other villains.

He broke out
and poisoned Gotham's water supply.

Well...

...I suppose I could poison Kripke.

- No, no.
- It's a simple matter.

There are several toxic chemicals
that would be untraceable in an autopsy.

Okay, that's the spirit...

...but let's dial it back
to a nonlethal form of vengeance.

Oh.

How about we put a whoopee cushion
on his office chair?

He'll sit down and it'll sound
like he's flatulent even though he's not.

Let's keep thinking.

Oh, gee, you're too late.

Scarlett Johansson
and Wonder Woman were here...

...trolling around
for neurotic little weasels.

I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

- I don't think she wants to see you.
- Why not?

Come on. You hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week.

Plus, I've been kind of talking
some smack about you.

- Hello, Howard.
- Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

- I can't. I'm working.
- This will only take a second.

You asked me to think about
where our relationship was going...

...and I did.

Bernadette...

...will you marry me?

Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

No, I'm serious.

I'm never gonna find another girl
like you...

...who likes me and is, you know, real.

- So this isn't a joke?
- No.

Then you're insane.

I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

Howard, we've only been on three dates.
We haven't even had sex yet.

Fair enough. When's your break?

Wow.

Don't you just hate
when this happens?

Wow.

All right, how's this for revenge?

A solution of hydrogen peroxide
and one of saturated potassium iodide.

- What's this?
- Mountain Dew.

Ah. Refreshing.

Now, we're going to combine these
chemicals with ordinary dish soap...

...creating a little exothermic release
of oxygen.

- Foamy vengeance.
- Yes, exactly.

This is brilliant, Sheldon.

How are we gonna deploy it
in Kripke's office?

Already taken care of. Observe.

This is a live shot of Kripke's lab
via a mini webcam I was able to install...

...thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed
in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

At the same time, I also secured
large quantities of these chemicals...

...above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

Sheldon, you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

You flatter me, sir.

- Let me guess, motion sensors?
- Yes.

The reaction will be triggered when
Kripke reaches the center of the room.

Mwa, ha, ha.

I gotta say, I am really impressed.

This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way
to get even.

It may be low-tech...

...but I still maintain
the whoopee cushion has comic validity.

Here comes Kripke.

Who's that with him?

I believe that's the president
of the university.

- The board of directors. Abort! Abort!
- There is no abort.

- How could you not put in an abort?
- I made a boo-boo, all right?

<i>I think the board will really appreciate
how well we're using that NSA grant.</i>

<i>Right here
we have a micro-controlled plasma...</i>

Wow.
Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.

At least they don't know it was you.

<i>Hello, Kripke.</i>

<i>This classic prank comes to you...</i>

<i>...from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.</i>

<i>If you'd like to see the look
on your stupid face...</i>

<i>...this video is being Instantly uploaded
to YouTube.</i>

<i>Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter
and Raj Koothrappali...</i>

<i>...for their support and encouragement
In this enterprise.</i>

Well, I'm going back to India.
What's your plan?

- Hey, here's your tip from Table 7.
- Oh, thanks.

- Mm-hm.
- Testing. Check. Check two.

Oh, now what?

- You want me to throw him out?
- No, that's okay.

Are you sure? He's small.

Bet I could get a nice tight spiral
on him.

I wanna dedicate this number
to a great gal who I've done wrong.

<i>Bernadette</i>

<i>I am so sorry
For trying to propose to you</i>

<i>Bernadette</i>

<i>You found It creepy
But that's just the kind of thing I do</i>

<i>Ahhh</i>

<i>I know now It was too soon
To talk of love</i>

<i>It was just a crazy idea
That came to me In my tub</i>

<i>But, Bernadette
Give me one more chance</i>

<i>Sweet Bernadette</i>

<i>I'll get the hang of this thing
They call romance</i>

<i>Sweet Bernadette</i>

<i>I dream to once again
Kiss your lips</i>

<i>Sweet Bernadette</i>

<i>Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz</i>

<i>Bernadette</i>

Oh, I am so sorry.

Are you kidding?

That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

<i>Bernadette</i>

Thank you, Cheesecake Factory.

Hey, Leonard, check this out.

Leonard, she's doing it again.

I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...

...without regard
for its equitable distribution.

This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

You want me to put it back?

- Leonard?
- It upsets Sheldon...

...when you play with the Sheldon.

What's up, my nerdizzles?

Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

- Hello.
- Leonard, Penny.

- You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
- Yeah. Hey.

Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

I don't think I can.

I don't have Howard's street cred.

I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- No, that's a false equivalency.

More does not equal merry.

If there were 2000 people in this apartment,
would we be celebrating?

No, we'd be suffocating.

- Sheldon.
- Don't "Sheldon" me.

- We ordered for five people, not six.
- It's fine.

We'll put it on the table, family-style.

Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

...have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

Relax. It'll be fine. Sit down, you guys.

- No.
- What?

Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

He can't sit somewhere else?

In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...

...so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.

In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...

...created by opening windows there.

It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...

...yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

- I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

- Where'd you get them?
- Shoes for Less.

- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

My mother was right. Hell is real.

Come on, Sheldon,
let the women-folk chat.

Women-folk?

Gals? Chicks?

Utero-Americans?

- Just eat your dinner.
- Don't take him too seriously.

A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.

Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

Howard, never let her go.

Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...

- ...of quantum mechanics.
- I am. Are you interested in physics?

I find it fascinating.

If I hadn't gone into microbiology...

...I probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.

My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...

...have reached an interesting point.

We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

- That's amazing.
- Yes.

Leonard's work is nearly
as amazing as third graders...

...growing lima beans
in wet paper towels.

While I appreciate the "oh, snap".

...I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

Yes, I am.

- Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
- Oh, yeah. Show me.

In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

- Howard?
- Yeah?

Your shoes are delightful.

Where did you get them?

- What?
- Buzzinga. I don't care.

Ha-ha. Eat my dust,
racially stereotypical plumber.

That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

And a cow and a penguin.

Face it, dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.

- Just need a little more practice.
- What you need is cheat codes...

...motor skills and a genie
who grants wishes...

...to little boys
who suck at "Mario Kart."

Sheldon,
can I talk to you for a second?

It's not about shoes, is it?

I don't think
I could go through that again.

- It's not about shoes.
- Then speak.

- Um, actually, can we do it in private?
- All right.

Go away.

I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.

I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.

- A little physics?
- Yeah.

There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.

From quantum particles to supernovas.

From spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

Okay, cool,
I don't need the PBS special.

I wanna know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

Like Bernadette does.

- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- Because I wanna surprise him.

Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

This would be
a massive undertaking...

...and my time
is both limited and valuable.

You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

Okay, point.

What sort of foundation do you have?

Did you take any science classes
in school?

Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

The one with the frogs.

It was pretty cool. A lot of the girls
threw up. I gutted that thing like a deer.

No. I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

Oh, come on, a smart guy like you?
It'll be a challenge.

You could make it like an experiment.

Interesting.

I suppose if someone could teach
sign language to Koko the gorilla...

...I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

Great. It's a little insulting, but great.
I'll be Koko.

Mm. Not likely. Koko learned to understand
over 2000 words.

Not one of which
had anything to do with shoes.

Hey, fellas,
this is my girlfriend, Bernadette.

My girlfriend, Bernadette.

- Who are all those people?
- I have no idea.

- Hey, Leonard.
- Hi.

Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend, Bernadette.

Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines. Heh.

He doesn't mean salt mines.
He means where he works.

Yeah, no, I got it.

- So how's your experiment going?
- Terrific.

Getting the electron accelerator set up.
We should be ready day after tomorrow.

- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

Really? That'd be great.

How exciting is that?

Like Hanukkah in July.

Do they have that?

- No.
- Oh, you got me again.

This isn't non-fat yogurt.
This is fatty-fat fat.

Excuse me.

- Could you grab me another napkin?
- Sure.

Thanks, honey.

All right. What is your deal?

Excuse me?

Inviting my girlfriend
to come see your electron accelerator?

Yeah, so?

Wow, you really are a piece of work.

It's not enough
you get the prom queen...

...you have to get the head
of the decorating committee too?

- What are you talking about?
- Look, don't play innocent with me.

I practically invented using
fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

- Has it ever worked?
- Not so far, but that's not the point.

Howard, relax.
I am not interested in your girlfriend.

I hope not,
because you don't wanna mess with me.

I'm crazy.

I believe you.

<i>Research journal, entry one.</i>

<i>I'm about to embark on one of the great
challenges of my scientific career:</i>

<i>teaching Renny physics.</i>

<i>I'm calling It Project Gorilla.</i>

- Hey, Sheldon.
- Come in. Take a seat.

<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

<i>I've extended a friendly,
casual greeting.</i>

Ready to get started?

One moment.

<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

<i>Apparently, ignorance Is bliss.</i>

All right, let us begin.

- Where's your notebook?
- Um, I don't have one.

How are you gonna take notes
without a notebook?

I have to take notes?

How else are you gonna study
for the tests?

- There's gonna be a test?
- Tests.

Here. It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Now, introduction to physics.

What is physics?

<i>Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika."</i>

It's at this point
that you'll wanna start taking notes.

<i>Physika means the science
of natural things.</i>

And it is there in ancient Greece
that our story begins.

- Ancient Greece?
- Ah. If you have questions, raise your hand.

It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 B.C.

You've finished your shopping
at the local market or agora.

And you look up at the night sky.

And there you notice
some of the stars seem to move...

<i>...so you name them planetes
or wanderer.</i>

Yes, Penny?

Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

This is the beginning of a 2600-year
journey we're going to take together...

...from the ancient Greeks
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr...

...to Erwin Schrödinger...

...to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

- Twenty-six hundred years?
- Yeah, give or take.

As I was saying, it's a warm summer
evening in ancient Greece...

- Yes, Penny.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2600 years.

<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

<i>I am exhausted.</i>

- Howard?
- Uh... Huh?

It unhooks in the front.

Oh, that explains a lot.

Howard, I'm home.

Of course.

Senior fitness was canceled.

It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.

I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

That's great, Ma.

What's great
about an 80-year-old Armenian man...

...with half his chin scraped off?

- I guess I should go.
- No, don't move.

Hey, Ma,
can I have lamb stew for dinner?

Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.

Please? I got a real hankering.

Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy-face.

- I'll be back soon.
- Thanks, Ma.

Do you want the
regular peas or the Le Sueur?

Always Le Sueur peas
with lamb stew.

You're right.
When you're right, you're right.

- What if they're out of the Le Sueur?
- Then get the regular!

All right. You don't have to yell.

Sorry about that.

- Let me just put that on vibrate.
- I'm already on vibrate.

Okay, now, that one I got.

Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

What do you mean?

He says if I go see his experiment
tomorrow, it might weird you out.

Really? He said that?

- You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
- Me? No.

I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate...

...to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment...

...without discussing it with said man.

I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

I didn't say anything like that.
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew
with my mother.

Damn. Was this close on the bra.

Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong...

...and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared...

...as A and we get force...
Earth gravity.

- -equals mass times
9.8 meters per second per second.

So we can see that MA equals MG
and what do we know from this?

Uh... We know that Newton
was a really smart cookie.

Oh, is that where Fig Newtons
come from?

No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

- No, don't write that down.
- Sorry.

Now, if MA equals MG...

- ...what does that imply?
- I don't know.

What...? But...?
How can you not know? I just told you.

Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

Hey, you don't have to be so mean.

I'm sorry. Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

No. You just suck at teaching.

Really? Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

Oh, God.

Sheldon, look, I'm trying to understand
but you're going too fast.

- Can you just back up a little bit?
- All right.

It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

Not that far back.

Okay, at what point
did you begin to feel lost?

I don't know. Where were we looking up
at the night sky?

- Greece.
- Damn it.

Look,
there's no need to get frustrated.

People learn at different rates.

Unlike objects falling in a vacuum,
which...?

MA equals MG...?

- Squared?
- No.

- Aristotle?
- No.

- Five?
- Oh!

Oh, then I don't know.

- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid.

Well, that's no reason to cry.

No, one cries because one is sad.

For example, I cry because
others are stupid and it makes me sad.

Look, can we just please forget
about all this extra stuff...

...and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

All right.

Leonard is attempting to learn...

...why subatomic particles
move the way they do.

Really? That's it?
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

It's not. That's why Leonard does it.

Okay, I just have one question.

What exactly are subatomic particles?

- A good question.
- Thank you.

And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves, "What is physics?"

Oh, balls.

It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece.

Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

What did I do now?

I was in bed with Bernadette
and you text-blocked me.

- What?
- Yeah, we were completely naked...

...and about to devour each other
when:

You text her that I have a problem
with her hanging with you.

You do have a problem with her
hanging out with me.

But that's not what you tell her.

- What was I to tell her?
- I don't know.

Something that doesn't make me
come off as a petty, jealous douche.

And what would that be?

Come on,
do I have to think of everything?

Hey, Leonard,
am I too late to see your experiment?

- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you're doing here.

- Came to see Leonard's experiment.
- No, you didn't.

You said Leonard's experiment
was stupid.

You told her my experiment
was stupid?

I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

Look, let's not get off topic.
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

You know, I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

- Should I leave you two alone?
- No, Leonard, you should hear this.

Okay, good.
Because I wasn't really gonna go.

Look, I know I come off
as confident and worldly...

...but the truth is I'm not.

We're shocked.

Which is why I tend to feel threatened
by other guys.

Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

But I now realize how foolish that is.

He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in his sweater.

It was a full turtleneck.

- And why aren't you helping me?
- I don't know.

Maybe because I'm crazy?

Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

It's up to you.
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

Come here, tushy-face.

Tushy-face.
That is going on Twitter right now.

Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

The interference pattern was cool
when the electron beam was on.

I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

I've been thinking that, given
the parameters of your experiment...

...the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated rings...

...is no different than the experiment
already conducted in the Netherlands.

Their observed phase shift in
the diffusing electrons inside the ring...

...already demonstrated
the electric analogue...

...of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect.

That's it. That's all I know.

Oh, wait.

Fig Newtons were named after a town
in Massachusetts, not the scientist.

Aw, I always tear up when
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

Tears seem appropriate.

Enlargement of the heart muscle,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy...

...is a serious disease, which could lead
to congestive heart failure.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

- You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
- No, on the contrary.

I found the Grinch to be a relatable,
engaging character.

I was really with him up to the point that
he succumbed to social convention...

...and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

What a buzzkill that was.

<i>When we watch Frosty the Snowman,
he roots for the sun.</i>

Excuse me, but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

Frosty is merely a bit of frozen
supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

I just love decorating the Christmas tree,
it makes me feel like a little girl again.

We didn't have a tree
when I was growing up.

- Really? Why not?
- Mm, in my family...

...holidays weren't so much celebrated,
as studied for their anthropological...

...and psychological implications
on human society.

Oh, sounds festive.
Did you at least give presents?

Hm, in a way. We presented papers.

And then broke off into focus groups
and critiqued each other.

Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a tree?

Oh, yes.

We had a tree, we had a manger...

...we had an inflatable Santa Claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

To make things more jolly, there were
so many blinking lights on the house...

...they induced
neighborhood-wide seizures.

I take it you don't wanna
help us trim the tree?

I do not. But if you insist on decorating
a spider-infested fire hazard in my home...

...I would request
that you that add this.

What is it?

You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, very Christmassy.

Excuse me, it's much more Christmassy
than anything you've put on the tree.

Here we go.

December 25th, 1642, Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born in the summer.

His birthday was moved to coincide
with the traditional pagan holiday...

...that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

Which, frankly, sounds like more fun...

...than 12 hours of church
with my mother followed by a fruitcake.

Merry Newtonmas, everyone.

I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

No, it's fine. Sir Isaac can go
next to this candy cane.

No, Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

- No, he doesn't.
- I understand.

You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus...

...and you want
to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.

Perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you.

- What? Your mother's coming? When?
- Tomorrow.

When were you gonna tell me?

Oh. Tomorrow?

Why were you keeping this a secret?

- Well, I just... I thought...
- If I could interject here.

Obviously, Leonard is concerned that his
mother won't approve of you as his mate.

Wh...? Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.

- Yeah, you are. It's just my moth...
- If I could interject again.

Leonard comes from a remarkably
high-achieving family...

...who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

He probably feels that it's doubtful that
his mother will be overly impressed...

...with his dating a woman
whose most significant achievement...

...is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

Hey, it's a big menu.

There's two pages just for desserts.

I know. And those specials,
they change every day.

Okay, it's lame when I say it,
it's ridiculous when you pile on.

Okay. Sorry.

What did she say
when you told her we were going out?

Um...

You didn't tell her we were going out,
did you?

Um...

- Why not?
- Um...

Leonard,
I'm no expert on meditation...

...but if you're trying to calm yourself
down, I believe the word is "om."

It was so nice of you
to come to the airport to pick me up.

No trouble at all.

I drove, Mother.

I'm driving now.

Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

Thank you for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum-brain-dynamic theory.

My pleasure.

You know, for a non-physicist,
you have a remarkable grasp...

...of how electric dipoles
in the brain's water molecules...

...could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

Wait, wait, wait. When did you
send my mom notes on a paper?

August 16th.
Right after her carpal-tunnel surgery.

- Did I thank you for the flowers?
- You did.

- I don't really like flowers.
- Neither do I.

- But it's the social convention.
- It is, isn't it?

Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

- Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
- No, I heard that.

Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

I just don't understand why
he knows more about your life than I do.

Because Sheldon and I stay in touch
due to mutual interest and respect...

...while you avoid me
due to unresolved childhood issues.

It's what we think caused
your narcissistic-personality disorder.

We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

Although how we got
onto the subject of you is baffling.

Yes, but we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask.

Leonard, how are you?

- Fine, Mom. How are you?
- Menopausal.

Now I'm less fine.

- Have you heard your brother's engaged?
- No.

Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

My bad.
I did send a gift from both of us.

She's a remarkable girl. The youngest
appeals-court judge in New Jersey...

...and a two-time
Olympic bronze medalist.

You must be very happy.

Why? I'm not marrying her.

So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

Well, I'm not sure
about interesting, but...

- Not the time, Sheldon.
- Very well.

Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

It's all right, Sheldon.

I will just pretend that Leonard's
not withholding information.

Although, I will point out, Leonard,
that I am a trained psychiatrist...

...and you are exhibiting
the same secretive behavioral tics...

...that accompanied
your learning to masturbate.

Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

How I envy you.

So, Howard, have you and Rajesh
finally summoned the courage...

...to express your latent
homosexual feelings towards one another?

What? No.

Why not?

Because we don't have latent
homosexual feelings toward one another.

I see.

- No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
- And where is she this evening?

She had to go out of town,
her grandmother died.

I see.

"Her grandmother died."

Honest to God. Ahem.
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

What do you mean, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

- Tell her I have a girlfriend.
- All right.

He "has" a "girlfriend."

Her name is Bernadette.

She's a waitress, but going to school
to be a microbiologist.

The more passionately
you stick to this construct...

...the more you're hurting
your partner.

Do you really think your lips in my ear
is helping?

- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, glad you're here.

Sit down, I'll get you a plate.
Mom, you remember Penny?

Oh, yes, the waitress/actress
with the unresolved father issues.

Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?

Well, he sent me a football
and a catcher's mitt for Christmas...

...so I'm gonna say no.

If it helps,
we're all good with your breasts.

Classic overcompensation.

Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me. I'm divorcing yours.

- What?
- Yes. He was cheating on me.

- No.
- Yes.

With some waitress
from the university cafeteria.

Can you believe it? A waitress.

Oh, no offense, dear.

No, it sounded like a compliment.

- When did this happen?
- Well, let's see.

Sheldon, when did I
leave Leonard's father?

September 22nd.

Right,
the weekend after Leonard's dog died.

Mitzy's dead?

She was old and blind, Leonard.
What choice did we have?

I don't believe this.
Why am I the last to know?

Excuse me,
I am the one getting a divorce...

...Mitzy is the one who is dead,
why are you the one making a fuss?

You're right. I'm sorry.

I'm way out of line.

Penny, what's new in your life?

Nothing. Not a damn thing.

Thank you for driving me
back to my hotel.

Oh, it's not a problem.

I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but
he seemed a bit emotionally unstable...

...and you don't want someone like that
operating heavy machinery.

No, you do not.

Your "check engine" light is on.

Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that.

So you must be devastated
about your divorce.

Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed
to be in a vehicle...

...that's not subjected
to regular maintenance.

Come on, I mean, you're not upset
that your marriage is over?

Well, initially I felt something akin
to grief and perhaps anger...

...but that's the natural reaction
of the limbic system...

...to being betrayed
by a loathsome son of a bitch.

- Sure. Sure.
- Thankfully, my shock was mitigated...

...by the fact that I haven't had
intercourse with him in eight years.

- Eight years?
- Oh, that's nothing.

I've been responsible
for my own orgasms since 1982.

Yikes.

Wha...? What's so funny?

That's exactly what I say
during orgasms: Yikes.

I could use a drink.
You wanna stop for a drink?

- Oh, I don't drink.
- I do. I'll teach you.

Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

What is it?

I made tea.

I don't want tea.

I didn't make tea for you.

This is my tea.

Then why are you telling me?

It's a conversation starter.

That's a lousy conversation starter.

Oh, is it? We're conversing.
Checkmate.

What do you want, Sheldon?

<i>What I want is to be departing
the starship Enterprise...</i>

...in a one-man shuttlecraft
headed to the planetoid I rule...

...known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

Mm, I want that too.

Why are you here?

To comfort you, of course.

No, that's not going to work at all.
I'll comfort you from over here.

Leonard, what you're experiencing
is a classic Jungian crisis...

...in which the aging individual
mourns the loss...

...of the never-to-be-realized
ideal family unit.

- Thank you, that's very comforting.
- That's not the comforting part.

- It's not?
- No. No, the comforting part...

...is that the Germans have a term
for what you're feeling, "Weltschmerz."

It means the depression that arises
from comparing the world as it is...

...to a hypothetical idealized world.

You're right, I do feel better.

Yeah, the Germans have always been
a comforting people.

Just remember, Leonard, where
your biological family has failed you...

...you always have me,
your surrogate family.

You're my surrogate family?

If it's any consolation,
I'm not happy about it either. Good night.

Okay, now this time,
try drinking it all at once.

Ah.

Yikes.

I've been responsible
for my own buzz since 2003.

Another round for me
and my homegirl.

I feel a spreading warmth
through my extremities.

As long as you don't feel it
running down your pants, you're fine.

That is fascinating.

I'm noticing an immediate
lowering of my inhibitions.

For example, I'm seriously considering
asking that busboy...

...to ravish me in the alleyway
while I eat cheesecake.

What do you think?

Well, we are known
for our cheesecake.

- Hit us again.
- Yes.

- If a little is good, more must be better.
- Ha, ha.

- Hey, Bev, guess what?
- What?

I'm sleeping with your son.

Really?

Which one?

The one from whom
I live across the hall from.

Oh, well, that's convenient.
How did his penis turn out?

Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to
my boyfriend's mother about his penis.

Oh, fair enough.

What can you tell me, if anything,
about that busboy's penis?

Actually, I've only had the cheesecake.

One more time.

You know, Leonard did not wanna
tell you we were dating.

Really? That means he's either
embarrassed by the relationship...

...or he doesn't care enough
about his mother to tell her he's in one.

Either way,
one of us should be insulted.

- Well, let's go find out who.
- You go get a taxi.

I'm gonna slip my business card
into that busboy's back pocket...

...cupping his firm right buttock
as I do so.

- Leonard?
- Sonny boy.

Get out here!
Your mommy wants to talk to you!

What the hell is going on?

<i>You're In trouble.</i>

Why didn't you tell me
you were tapping my homegirl?

- Did I say that right?
- Yeah. Not bad, not bad.

Are you guys drunk?

Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would
we have stopped at Del Taco?

Now, how could you not tell me
you were in a relationship...

...with this lovely,
charming young woman?

- Heh, heh. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Is it because she's uneducated,
trapped in a menial service position?

What the hell happened
to lovely and charming?

How come you didn't tell me that you
and Father were getting a divorce?

How come you didn't tell me
you had surgery?

How come you didn't tell me
my dog died?

What I hear you saying...

...is that you want a more intimate
mother-son relationship.

I do.

There. It's late. Now, go to bed.

I'm getting a warm feeling
spreading through my heart.

That's the Del Taco.

Why is Leonard softly banging his head
against his bedroom door?

Speaking of warm feelings...

Come here.

No, I'd rather have the busboy.

Thank you for taking me to the airport.

You're very welcome.

Once again, I'm driving.
I'm right here.

Please, I am very hung-over...

...and in no mood
to satisfy your need for approval.

Sheldon, I do hope you forgive me
for my inappropriate behavior last night.

I don't blame you.

- You were intoxicated.
- Thank you.

I blame Penny.

I blame Penny too. Bad Penny.

Wait a minute, what are you talking
about? What inappropriate behavior?

- I think it's best that you not know.
- Agreed.

Agreed.

What the hell, agreed.

And I want you to take very good care
of this young woman.

- Aw. Thank you, Beverly.
- You're welcome.

She doesn't have much
in the way of career prospects.

Don't make her responsible
for her own orgasms as well.

Remember when I was complaining that
you don't communicate with me enough?

- Yes, dear.
- I'm over it.

Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...

...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?

No, it would just freak him out.

Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...

...I'm a passionate man...

...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

...so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.

Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

Good news. I've rented us...

<i>- ...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
- Got it.</i>

- Seen it.
- Detailed analysis posted online.

Then what are we gonna do tonight?

Sorry. Howard and I are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.

Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.

These broncos have been saddled.

How did we get actual women?

Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

It is great, isn't it?

We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.

- We do?
- Oh, yes.

I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

You and I are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

- I don't wanna do that.
- All right.

Well, I'm going to perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

Well, what about me?

Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

Maybe you should look into that.

Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

At the Glendale Galleria:
"Put on your best zoot suit.

It's a salute to swing music...

...in the center court near Macy's,
5 p.m. to 9 p.m."

Huh? Huh?

A salute to zoot.

- Sounds like a hoot.
- I'm sorry, Raj.

I have no desire
to salute any article of clothing tonight...

...much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

Race riots?

The Zoot Suit Riots.

Oh.

I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?

I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.

That's a semantically null sentence.

Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website:

"Seven p.m. to 10 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room...

...mixer for grad students
and faculty...

...of the Science
and Humanities Departments.

Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be."

Well, that's certainly amusing...

...but I have no interest.

Come on, Sheldon.

The world is filled with people
doing things outside.

Let's go outside. Outside is good.

If outside is so good...

...why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?

I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.

Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land...

...and I need to strut my stuff.

Let me offer you a compromise.

Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery...

...I use my imagination.

Oh, boy.

One of my favorite places to visit
is the two-dimensional world...

<i>...described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.</i>

I don't wanna go to Flatland.

You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.

I am now a hexagon
in two-dimensional space...

...and can only perceive the edges
of other objects.

Oy.

Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.

Sheldon, I'm begging you.

I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

Oh, look.

There's a sexually attractive
line segment.

- Chat her up.
- What?

Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab...

...watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize rodents...

...it really works up an appetite.

Flesh-eating bacteria
and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.

What does that tell you?

You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.

We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?

Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.

How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?

The last big thing I did
was this production...

<i>...of Diary of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.</i>

But I think things
might be turning around pretty soon.

Well, great. How come?

Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?

Of course.
I would never make fun of you.

Okay, well, I went to this psychic
who told me that if I cut my hair...

...I'm gonna get
a national commercial.

What? Seriously?

You're getting career advice
from a psychic?

Good job not making fun of her.

She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.

Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

They don't just let anyone
have a website.

- Why are you being such a jerk?
- You're surprised?

Your psychic didn't tell you
I was going to be a jerk?

Heh, heh. Bite me.

- Come on, Penny.
- Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

We're gonna make out back here.

I'm sliding into third.

Thanks for coming with me.

Thanks for giving me your limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

Did you really have to bring it
with you?

What if evil strikes
and my power ring runs low?

- Come on, let's get a drink.
- I don't drink.

Well, I do.

And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.

I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.

I would like a root-beerfloat.

- Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
- They don't?

Well, apparently these people and I
differ greatly on the definition of "party."

- He'll have a Shirley Temple.
- And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

- Okay, let's check out the females.
- All right.

There's a female.

That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.

But she's female. Isn't that the game?

- No. I'm looking for a hookup.
- Oh, yes.

So the point of this exercise is for you
to find someone to copulate with?

Not so loud. But ideally, yes.

- Thanks.
- Thank you.

And what is my function as wingman?

- You help me run my game.
- Okay.

And what is your game?

When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree.

Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?

It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

My friend is looking for someone
to copulate with.

You're very funny. I'm Abby.

- I'm Sheldon.
- How do you do?

Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Call me Raj.

- Hey, Raj. Where are you from?
- The mysterious subcontinent of India.

- Ooh. India.
- You know India?

<i>- I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
- Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.</i>

I thought your father
was a gynecologist.

I'm sorry.

Martha, come here.
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

- My friend Martha.
- Hi.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Is that the limited edition
Green Lantern lantern?

In brightest day, in darkest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

Oh, that is so awesome.

Thank you.

Have you chosen one
to copulate with?

So, what should we talk about?

Well, we could always learn more...

...about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots. Leonard?

We don't need
to talk about that anymore.

Leonard covered it pretty well
in the car.

I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

Right, and if you can't understand it,
it's not a fact.

No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

- Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
- Oh, you're welcome.

- How's your fish?
- Amazing.

- Would you like to try some?
- Yeah, sure.

Well, the fact is you can't.

Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

Help me out here.

Wanna jump in the middle
of another couple's argument?

- No, thank you.
- Sorry.

Maybe we should just stop talking
about this.

Maybe some of us
should stop talking altogether.

- How is everything tonight?
- Really uncomfortable.

The best thing about a monogamous,
mutually supportive relationship...

...is even if you have different ideas...

...you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for, even make love...

You want your fish?

Knew you were gonna do that.
Doesn't make me psychic.

Attaboy, Leonard. Make it worse.

<i>American woman</i>

<i>Listen what I say</i>

What's going on?

We scored.

I'm the wingman.

<i>American woman</i>

- Hey.
- Laser.

Had a great night last night.

I don't like to kiss and tell,
but somebody made it to eighth base.

- What the hell is eighth base?
- Seventh base with shirt off.

Well, my shirt.

- How'd things go with Penny?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

Are we taking
our relationship frustrations out...

...on innocent Cylons?

It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.

I was gonna try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch...

...but I can come back when
you don't have a high-powered weapon.

How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

Hey, I once dated a girl who believed
she was abducted by aliens.

And that didn't bother you?

<i>Au contraire, it meant she was gullible
and open to a little probing.</i>

What am I supposed to do?

Pretend I believe something I don't
when I'm with Penny?

Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things when she's with you.

Do me a favor.
Lean over, put your head right here.

Let me show you another way
to look at this.

Here we have the universe
of all women.

Okay, these are the ones
you wanna sleep with.

These are the women
who believe exactly what you believe.

These are the women
who would be willing to sleep with you.

And right there,
in the little triple intersection...

...is your ideal mate.

Odds are she's a short physicist
with low self-esteem...

...who lives in a government
research facility in China.

What's your point?

To keep having a sexual relationship
with Penny...

...I have to give up everything I believe in?
My intellectual integrity?

The very nature of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard.

I respect that.

- What is that?
- Your new girlfriend.

Have fun tonight.

"The dog."

"The roof."

"Grapes."

One minute.

- What was that?
- It means, "Come in."

It's taking forever to load the new
operating system on my computer.

I disinfected the kitchen
and the bathroom.

Now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

That's Hindi for,
"Whatever floats your boat."

Listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby...

...and she and Martha
wanna hang out with us again.

- What do you say?
- I don't say anything.

I merely offer you a facial expression
that suggests you've gone insane.

- I don't get it. You had a great time.
- Yes, exactly. I had a great time.

That's done.
I've moved on to other things.

For example, after I learn Finnish,
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

Please, Sheldon.

I'm a lost Indian boy far from home...

...and I want a girlfriend,
and I want her to be Abby...

...and she'll only come
if she can bring Martha.

I highly doubt
there is any argument you can make...

...threat you might levy,
rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation...

<i>...supplication or "vetoomus"
that you can employ...</i>

...that would convince me
to reconsider.

My Incredible Hulk hands
signed by Stan Lee.

Oh, my.

I've admired these for years.

Does that mean
we can go out with the girls again?

Hulk agree to second date
with puny humans.

You can't wear the hands on the date.

Hulk sad.

Hey.

Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

Not only is it courteous,
it's safety-smart.

Every year, 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer-lint ignition.

And now you're supposed to say,
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.
I could never be mad at you."

Wow. That's all you got after you were
the most obnoxious person...

...on a double date
that included Howard Wolowitz?

No, I'm sorry. I really am.

It's not right
to mock what a person believes in.

Thank you.

You willing to go to my psychic
and see what it's about?

You willing to read a book...

...that concisely explains
how all psychics are frauds?

I would not.

- Okay, let's go see your psychic.
- Really?

Well, yeah.
One of us has to keep an open mind.

- Saying I don't have an open mind?
- No. Let me help you with this stuff.

You know, I believe in ghosts too.

- Great.
- And astrology.

I know.
And pyramid power and healing crystals.

Oh, no, no, no. Crystals don't work.

Really? That's the line?

Psychics are real,
but crystals are voodoo?

Oh, voodoo's real.
You don't wanna mess with voodoo.

<i>Flatland is more
than just a mathematical essay.</i>

It is also a treatise
on Victorian social mores.

You know,
I had never considered that.

Wow. I mean, that's going
to completely change my visits there.

- Well, it's late.
- Uh-huh.

Time for bed.

Okay.

Good night, puny human.

Sheldon?

Yes?

Listen, they're kind of getting busy
in the living room...

...and I was wondering
if I could hang out in here for a while.

Well, I suppose. Come in.

I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.

Boy, seems like forever since
the four of us have been out to eat.

You know, just the guys.

Oh, God. Yes, we get it.
You have a girlfriend now.

- A little jealous, are we?
- No, I'm not jealous.

All right, I'd kill a hobo if it would
get me laid. Now, can we order?

Oh, dear Lord, they redid the menu.

So what? It's the same food.

Oh, is it? Look at this.

General Tso's Chicken
is no longer listed under "specialties."

It's now under "chicken."

- So?
- Yes, General Tso.

Not "Tso" the chicken,
"so" the question.

- So?
- So why is it no longer a specialty?

Did the chef lose confidence
in the dish or himself?

And look over here.
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

What is mobster sauce?

- It's obviously a typo.
- Perhaps.

Or perhaps this restaurant's now
a front for organized crime.

For all we know, the mobster sauce...

...contains actual chunks
of deceased mobsters.

No, no, no. I think it just means
it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

It doesn't mean any of that.
It's a typo.

- You know what? Let's just get a pizza.
- Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.

Sure, no mobsters there.

You know, the more I think about it...

...the mobster sauce couldn't
possibly contain chunks of mobster.

- And why is that?
- It was listed under "seafood."

What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

Leonard, are we having
a serious conversation or not?

What the...?

- The TV is gone.
- So are our laptops.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God!

It's all right.

They didn't take my comic books.

They took our TV, two laptops,
four external hard drives...

...our PS2, our PS3, our Xbox,
our Xbox 360, our classic Nintendo...

...our Super Nintendo,
our Nintendo 64, and our Wii.

We like games.

Right, games. They took "Halo 1," "Halo 2,"
"Halo 3," "Call of Duty 1," "Call of Duty 2"...

..."Call of Duty 3," "Rock Band"...

..."Final Fantasy I" through "IX,"
"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"...

..."The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"
"Super Mario Bros."

..."Mario & Sonic
at the Winter Olympics"...

...and "Ms. Pac-Man."

Assorted video games.

When does the CSI team get here?

- What?
- In anticipation of their arrival...

...I've bagged some evidence.

One of the thieves had the audacity
to quench his thirst...

...while ransacking our home.
You should be able to pull prints off this.

Here are my prints
so you can rule me out as a suspect.

- What about me?
- I'm sorry, Leonard...

...it's too early to discount the possibility
of this being an inside job.

Would I be completely out of line
to ask you to shoot him?

I'd be happy to put him under
a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

We're done. Call this number,
and we'll fax you a copy of the report.

You can submit it
to your insurance company.

I'm sorry, that's the end
of your inquiry?

Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

Goodness. Where do I begin?
For instance, my laptop...

...contained four out of the five
gedanken experiments necessary...

...for a restatement of
the quantum measurement problem.

How's that going to help them?

They could monitor
scientific publications...

...and see if anyone posts such
a restatement in the next couple of months.

If so, the authors are most likely
in possession of my stolen laptop.

Good night, fellas.

Come on, Bochco.

What are we supposed to do now?

The only thing we can do:

Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return...

...and bludgeon us to death
in our sleep.

Does that mean you've ruled me out
as a suspect?

Oh, how I wish I could.

I do not have to urinate.

I am the master of my own bladder.

Drat.

I can't believe it. If I hadn't
been working the dinner shift...

...I would've run right into
the robbers.

Hey, there's no reason for you
to be scared.

I'm not scared. I would've gone
all Nebraska on their asses.

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

- Leonard and Penny.
- Hand me the bat.

We just had a major crime
in the building...

...and you open the door
without asking who it is?

It won't happen again. What's up?

Nothing. Just wanted to see
if you were both okay.

We're fine, Sheldon.

All right, then.

- Good night.
- Good night.

- Well, that was weird. Even for him.
- Mm.

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.

Who is it?

Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.

- Yes?
- May I come in?

Yeah.

I see you're drinking wine.

Yes, we are. And we're about
to go to bed.

Uh-huh.

Sheldon, do you wanna
sleep here tonight?

As small as Leonard is...

...I don't think the two of you
would be comfortable on the couch.

- So, what do you want?
- It's not what I want.

It's what evolution wants.
Human beings are primates.

Primates have evolved to live in groups
both for protection and support.

But you don't like other people.

I do tonight.

It's scary over there.

It's getting scary here too.

Um...

"Three Little Kittens"?

"Three Little Pigs"?

God, I don't know.

<i>Star Wars?</i>

Did we win? Can we go to bed?

Good Lord, I could not have
made this easier.

A hydrogen atom, H,
plus pigs minus P, "higs."

Bow, General Zod trapped
in the Phantom Zone...

..."bow-zone."

Pear, tickle, "pear-tickle."

"Higgs boson particle."
How could you not get that?

He's right, Penny. It's all there.

Look, Sheldon, sweetie,
I know you're feeling insecure...

- ...but we've really gotta go to sleep.
- All right.

I'll take the first watch
and wake you at 0400.

- Great. Good night.
- Wait, wait. What's 0400?

- Four a.m.
- That's, like, in 45 minutes.

Just keep walking.

<i>- It's quiet out there.
- Maybe a little too quiet.</i>

<i>- Where are you going?
- Just gonna take a look around outside.</i>

Bad idea.

<i>No, Jim, don't open the door.</i>

Listen to her, Jim.

<i>Don't worry. There's no one out there.</i>

Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.

Who is it?

All right. We've got a titanium deadbolt
and a reinforced jam controlled by...

...a state-of-the-art
electronic access system.

- What if they cut the power?
- There's a 200-watt...

- ...uninterruptible backup power supply.
- If someone steals my keys?

There are independent voice
and fingerprint scanners.

What if somebody kidnaps me,
records my voice...

...and then cuts off my thumb?

I'll send them a basket of muffins.

Now, inside we've got motion detectors,
infrared sensors...

...and cameras connected to a server...

...running state-of-the-art
facial-recognition software.

Where did you get all this stuff?

I got a buddy over at
the Department of Defense.

- He just gave it to you?
- I'm sure he would've if I'd asked.

Ironically, their security isn't
all that good.

Raj, your car is blocking me.

<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

<i>- Intruder alert.
- What the hell?</i>

<i>- Sorry, let me help you.
- Intruder alert.</i>

Wonderful security system if
we're attacked by a school of tuna.

Don't worry,
the net's gonna be electrified.

Picture her on the floor,
spasming uncontrollably.

Better.

<i>Sheldon's journal.</i>

<i>Security system In place.
However, sleep continues to elude me.</i>

<i>I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena...</i>

<i>...this so-called City of Roses...</i>

<i>...and It haunts me. Ah! The Injustice.</i>

<i>I lie here awake, tormented,
while out there, evil lurks...</i>

<i>...probably playing "Donkey Kong"
on my classic Nintendo.</i>

Oh, dear.

I am the master of my own bladder.

Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

Oh, my...

God, Sheldon.

What the hell are you doing
out there?

I heard a noise.

It was us.
We knocked over a lamp.

- Why would you knock over a lamp?
- We were gonna...

He doesn't need to know
what we were doing, Leonard.

Oh.

No, she's right. I don't need to know
what you were doing.

- Carry on.
- What are you doing? Use the door.

Good thinking.

Hey, perhaps I'll check the perimeter
and make some warm milk.

Great. You do that.

Would you like me to bring you
some warm milk?

I'm lactose intolerant.

And you don't wish to alarm me with
any more loud noises. Very thoughtful.

- Warm milk, Penny?
- No, thanks.

Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.

- Sorry about that.
- What can you do?

<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.</i>

Looks like Wolowitz
got the net electrified.

- Sheldon, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

Though I'm no longer
the master of my own bladder.

My new computer came with
Windows 7.

Windows 7 is much more user-friendly
than Windows Vista.

I don't like that.

Don't you think looking for a new city
to live in is a bit of an overreaction?

Our apartment was broken into.

Our security system tried to kill me.

And as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena
forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.

Come on, Sheldon. You can't move.
Don't you need to stay in one place...

...so the mother ship can find you
when it returns?

Oh, if that were only true.

Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future...

...I need to find a location
that's more hospitable...

...than the mean streets of Pasadena.
Like Enid, Oklahoma.

Low crime rate,
and high-speed Internet connectivity...

...but no model-train shops.

Sorry, Enid.

Is he quitting his job
at the university?

Oh, no. He's gonna telecommute.

Everybody's really excited about it.

All right. Boone, North Carolina.

"Every summer since 1952,
Boone has hosted...

...an outdoor amphitheater portrayal
of the life and times...

...of its namesake: Danel Boone."

That sounds like something
that would attract the wrong crowd.

- Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?
- Born and raised.

It will take me a few days to get settled.
After I do, I will e-mail you...

...detailed PDFs containing diagrams
and instructions...

...that will guide you through packing
and shipping my possessions...

...to Bozeman, Montana.

In the meantime,
please forward my mail.

Anyplace specific, or just
the Bozeman, Montana loony bin?

I sense you're making a joke,
but Bozeman does have...

...a comedy club called the Loony Bin,
so do not forward my mail there.

Oh, come on. So you were the victim
of a crime. That's part of life.

When my great-grandfather
first came to this country...

...he put all his hopes and dreams
into this little butcher shop...

...he ran on the Lower East Side
of New York. You know what happened?

Every customer who
walked into that butcher shop...

...and asked for a pound of liver...

...got ripped off.

But those people moved on,
and so should you.

I am moving on.
I'm going to be a Bozite.

They call themselves Bozites?

They should. It's one of the first things
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

Please, Penny. As you know, I'm not
comfortable with prolonged goodbyes...

...and maudlin displays of emotion,
so I've prepared a short video.

<i>Greetings. As you know, I'm not
comfortable with prolonged goodbyes...</i>

<i>...and maudlin displays of emotion,
so I've prepared this short video.</i>

<i>The four of you are three of my closest
friends and one treasured acquaintance.</i>

<i>Though I cannot state categorically
that my life will be diminished...</i>

<i>...by not having you in it, I am
comfortable If you choose to believe that.</i>

<i>Since you intend to remain
In this lawless metropolitan area...</i>

<i>...statistics suggest that you will
succumb to tragic and gruesome ends...</i>

<i>...before we meet again.
Live long and prosper.</i>

Sheldon, that's so...

You might wanna lock the door
behind me. This isn't Bozeman.

How the hell do I know who's the friend
and who's the acquaintance?

That is a bracing cold.
An invigorating cold.

Lord, is it cold.

Help you with your bag, sir?

Thank you, fellow Bozite.

And may I say,
you are the living embodiment...

...of all the promises made by
our lovely town's chamber of commerce.

Wait.

Excuse me!

One ticket to
Pasadena, California, please.

Hey, look who's back.

Interesting. The acquaintance is
the first to greet me.

What you doing?

Attempting to view work
as a peripheral image...

...so as to engage
the superior colliculus of my brain.

Interesting. I usually just have coffee.

- You've been up all night?
- Is it morning?

- Yes.
- Then I've been up all night.

And you're stuck?

Why else would a person try to engage
their superior colliculus?

Uh, sorry, sweetie.
I can't help you till I've had my coffee.

If you don't put him in his crate at night,
he just runs around the apartment.

What is he doing now?

Mm, he's either isolating the terms
of his formula...

...and examining them individually...

...or looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand...

...after Peter Pan cut it off.

Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile, not an alligator.

If you're going to mock me,
at least get your facts straight.

Aye, aye, captain.

I can't see it.

It just won't coalesce.

Maybe you need a fresh start.

You're right.

Great idea, Leonard. Thank you.

Electrons move through graphene,
act as if they have no mass.

How long has he been stuck?

Mm, intellectually, about 30 hours.

Emotionally, about 29 years.

Unit cell contains two carbon atoms.

Interior angle of a hexagon
is 120 degrees.

Have you tried rebooting him?

No. I think it's a firmware problem.

Hey, it's disco night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink tonight.

Who's up for getting down?

Oh, that's perfect.

Bernadette's been hawking me
to take her roller skating.

Penny likes to skate.
The four of us could double.

We're in.

Great. It's not like I brought it up
because I wanted to go.

- You can come with us.
- No. I don't have to go.

I'm happy just to guide you
to suitable entertainment choices.

I'm a walking, brown yelp.com.

Structure, constant structure.
One atom.

Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?

Yeah. This morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

I thought I smelled popcorn.

The same as fermions.
Travels on a pathway.

Hexagonal. Always hexagonal.

<i>I haven't seen him this stuck since he
tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.</i>

Hey. Those are my lima beans.

Not lima beans. Carbon atoms.

But if I don't eat my lima beans,
I can't have my cookie.

Here. You want my peas?

Peas. Perfect. They can be electrons.

You want my corn?

Don't be ridiculous.

What would I do with corn?

Roller skating.
Shall we grab a bite to eat first?

Good. P.F. Chang's?
My mom has coupons.

Oh, great.

- Your mom is not coming, right?
- Not this time. I promise.

Just to be clear,
roller-skating was my idea.

I'm unhappy
that you turned it into a date...

...and I hope you both fall on your asses
and break your coccyxes.

The plural of "coccyx" is "coccyges."

Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

Oh, my God.
Have you ever been so embarrassed?

Not recently.

I don't know which was lamer,
their roller skating or their disco dancing.

For me, the worst part was when
people saw us leave with them.

You had some nice moves out there,
Howard.

- Thanks. You too.
- You noticed all the people looking at us?

Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

- And when Howard tried to do the splits?
- Shh.

Sorry, I'm moving slow.

- I think I bruised my coccyx.
- Aw, poor baby.

Don't tell Koothrappali.

- After you.
- Oh. What a gentleman.

Hey, Sheldon.

Oh, my God, are you...? Whoa!

Good Lord! You're ruining everything!

- Oh, damn.
- Are you okay?

Do I look okay?

Don't bark at me. I fell too.

You've been falling all night.
You're used to it.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

The same thing I've been doing.

Trying to figure out why electrons
have no mass...

- ...when traveling through graphene.
- With marbles?

I needed something bigger
than peas, now, didn't I?

Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

Two, three days.

Not important. I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

I need to determine where
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas...

...squateth the toad of truth.

The toad of truth?
Is that a physics thing?

No. That's a crazy thing.

Okay, Sheldon.

What happens to our neuroreceptors
when we don't get enough REM sleep?

They lose their sensitivity to serotonin
and norepinephrine.

Which leads to...

Impaired cognitive function.

Right. So march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

But I don't wanna go to bed.

I'm gonna count to three. One...

Oh, all right.

That was amazing
how you handled him.

I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

My mother used to run an illegal
daycare center in our basement.

Leonard. You're giggling in your sleep.

It's not me. It's my new ring tone.

<i>The Joker. From Batman.</i>

Well, it creeps me out.

Me too. But I paid 3 bucks for it.

Well, just answer the phone.

Hello?

Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

Yeah. He's my roommate.

Oh. Is he okay?

All right. I'll be right there.

What happened?

Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

Okay, have fun.

Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

- Where is he?
- Ball pit.

- Thanks for not calling the cops.
- Oh, it's no big deal.

My sister's got a kid who's special.

Yeah, well, he's extra special.

Hey, Shelly.

What you doing?

Size ratio was all wrong.
Couldn't visualize it.

Needed bigger carbon atoms.

Sure, sure.

How did you get into this place?

Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,
single circuit alarm. Child's play.

You can start sorting
protons and neutrons...

...while I build carbon atoms.

No, I don't think so.
We need to go home now.

But I'm still working.

If you don't come out of there,
I'm gonna have to drag you out.

You can try...

...but you'll never catch me.

For God sakes.

Sheldon, come here!

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Leonard and Penny.

- Leonard and Penny.
- Aah!

What? What, what, what?

Leonard and Penny.

- What?
- I have good news.

And you had to barge in
and wake us up...

- ...in the middle of the night?
- Your cell phone was off.

Because we didn't
wanna be disturbed.

That didn't work out, did it?

Sheldon, what do you want?

I came to tell you I've got the answer.

Really?

You figured out
the graphene problem?

No, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that.
But I figured out how to figure it out.

I know I said I could handle
your roommate, but I was wrong.

We have to break up.

What are you talking about?

- Ahem.
- Oh.

Einstein.

Yeah. I'm gonna need a little more.

Albert Einstein.

Keep going.

When Einstein came up
with special relativity...

...he was working
at the patent office.

So you're gonna go work
at the patent office?

Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.

I could never live in a city
whose streets are laid out...

...in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.

No. I'm going to find
a similarly menial job...

...where my basal ganglia are occupied
with a routine task...

...freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background.

A great plan.

Of course. Even talking to you
is sufficiently menial.

I can feel the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

Okay.
Well, thanks for sharing with us.

- Good night.
- You're welcome.

Good night to you too.

Oh. By the way, I was watching you sleep
for a moment.

I noticed your snoring seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

No. Leonard doesn't snore.

No. I wasn't talking to Leonard.

Told you.

So, Mr. Cooper,
you're looking for a job.

A menial job.

Like yours.

Why, thank you for noticing.

I'm menial employee of the month.

Do you have a particular field in mind?

I do. For thousands of years...

...the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...

...to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.

Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...

...through which they trudged.

Do you have anything like that?

- No.
- Shouldn't you check your database?

No.

You didn't really type.

I didn't really have to.

So how about construction?

Oh, that would be good.

Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...

...as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...

...high above the metropolis.

No, no. This is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in Rosemead.

- I could do that.
- Good.

- One question.
- Yes?

What's sheetrock?

Moving on.

How about doing deliveries
for a florist?

That seems acceptable.

- Do you have your own car?
- I don't drive.

Of course you don't.

Mr. Cooper,
let me just ask you a question.

What was your last job?

Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CaITech, focusing on M Theory.

Or in layman's terms, string theory.

I see.

Just give me a second.

Security!

Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.

Behind you.

Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?

Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.

No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?

A reasonable question.

I asked myself:

"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"

Three answers came to mind.

A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...

...and what Penny does.

Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...

...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...

...here I am.

You just walked in
and they hired you?

- Just like that?
- Oh, heavens no.

Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.

Let me get that plate out of your way.

Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...

...regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...

...while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.

- Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
- Thanks.

Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

You're right. That is more menial.

Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

I don't recommend the salmon.

I saw it in the kitchen.

All right. One bacon cheeseburger...

...breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.

Kudos.

And beer-battered fish and chips.

Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.

A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.

And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...

...no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

Hang on.

- Black beans, not pinto beans?
- Yes.

- Guacamole? No cilantro? Lettuce?
- Yep.

- Understand why I'm doing this?
- I do.

That'll be all.

That was fun.

How long can he keep this up?

I heard about this professor
who melted down, bought a van...

...spent the rest of his life
as a dog groomer.

Never went back to the university?

Only to shampoo
Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.

Sheesh.

You know, I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

But he's afraid of dogs.

Yeah. That's the only thing wrong
with that plan.

Hey, guys. Sorry you had to wait,
but we are swamped.

What's this?

Sheldon took our order.

Sheldon doesn't work here.

Well, honey, not to complain...

...but we were starting to think
you didn't either.

Is that really necessary?

Good Lord.

The interference pattern
in the fracture.

The motion of the wave
through the structure.

I've been looking at it all wrong.

I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

They move through the graphene
as a wave.

It's a wave!

The moment to applaud would be now.

Troglodytes.

Sheldon. Where are you going?
Aren't you gonna clean this?

I'm sorry, I don't work here.

- Happy now?
- I'm on a cloud.

Swing me.

<i>Not much between despair and ecstasy</i>

<i>One night in Bangkok
And the tough guys tumble</i>

<i>Can't be too careful with your company</i>

<i>I can feel the devil walking next to me</i>

Sheldon, come here!

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Buzzinga.

Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie. Ha, ha.

Okay, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tonight.

Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.

No, you hang up first.

Hello?

Dude, I'm glad
you finally got a girlfriend...

...but do you have to do lovey-dovey
in front of us who don't?

Actually, he might have to.

There's an economic concept
known as a "positional good"...

...in which an object is only valued
because it's not possessed by others.

The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch...

...to replace the more colloquial
but less precise "neener-neener."

That's not true. My happiness
is not dependent on my best friend...

- ...being miserable and alone.
- Thank you.

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.

- Who's miserable and alone?
- Me.

Oh. I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.

In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener."

What are you and Bernadette doing
for Valentine's Day?

Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special...

...at P.F. Chang's.

Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok.

Yeah, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front.

Given that Saint Valentine...

...was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded...

...wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration...

...be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

I understand your point,
but given the choice...

...Jews always go with Chinese food.

If anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day...

...the same way
I spend every Valentine's.

Buying rotisserie chicken,
taking it home, standing over the sink...

...and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal.

Okay, so to sum up,
one giant marble horse...

...one asinine comment,
one lonely man and his chicken...

...and let's see. Who's left?

Oh, that's right, my plans.

Isn't anyone gonna ask?

- You're gonna have sex with Penny.
- That's not what I was gonna tell you.

It's okay. I don't mind hearing
about your sex life.

It's his that bugs me.

Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland...

...to attend a conference and see the
CERN Super Collider on February 14th?

Professor Norton. God knows why.

He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize.

Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.

I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his girlfriend.

- Weathergirl on Channel Two?
- That's the one.

In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him.

In Switzerland
or with the big-boobed weather girl?

Switzerland.
And I get to bring a guest.

- Oh, no way, dude!
- Oh, my God, this is incredible.

I'm so happy I'm not gonna question
their judgment in picking you.

I'm just gonna run home
and start packing.

Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?

I am taking Penny.

Oh.

Then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home.

- Sheldon, you got a minute?
- Of course, my good friend. Come in.

Yeah, help me out.

Which ski hat says,
"Après Super Collider"?

Sheldon,
I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

Well, of course you are.
Who else would you take?

- Penny.
- What? That's absurd.

Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire...

...in the shadow
of the snow-capped Alps.

But Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

I'm sorry, Sheldon.

Sorry? I've been dreaming about
going to the Large Hadron Collider...

...since I was 9 years old.

I've been dreaming about spending
Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.

Shame on you.

That's no dream for a scientist.

- Okay, what's the big surprise?
- Just a minute.

This tray contains clues...

...as to what you and I are going
to be doing on Valentine's Day.

Oh, wow, okay. Let's see.

We've got milk chocolate,
Swiss cheese, fondue.

My lactose-intolerant boyfriend
is gonna eat all this...

...then I'm gonna climb on his back
and rocket to the moon?

No.

But it does involve air travel.

Okay. Um...

Let me slice this Swiss cheese
with my Swiss Army knife...

...and then you can wash it down...

...with a cup
of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

Okay, I'm starting to think
"Swiss" is key here.

Uh-huh.

We're going to Disneyland
and ride the Matterhorn.

How does that involve air travel?

We're going to Disney World
and ride the Matterhorn.

- No.
- Okay, sweetie, this started out fun...

...but I'm over it.

We're going to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider.

And ski. We'll also go skiing.

- We're going skiing in Switzerland?
- You'll ski, I'll fall.

But, yeah, we will be in Switzerland
for Valentine's Day.

- Oh, my God, Leonard, that's incredible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

Not so fast.

You might wanna hold off
on lighting your Rääbeliechtli, Penny.

My ribee-what-ly?

Rääbeliechtli, it means turnip light...

...and refers to a lantern
hand-carved from a root vegetable...

...to celebrate Swiss festivals
which you'll not be celebrating...

...because, A,
these festivals occur in the fall...

...and B,
you will not be going to Switzerland.

Sheldon, we've been through this.
I'm taking Penny.

Afraid not. Do you recognize this?

- Oh, not the roommate agreement.
- Indeed, the roommate agreement.

I call your attention
to the Friendship Rider...

...in Appendix C: Future Commitments.
Number 37:

"In the event one friend is ever invited
to visit the Large Hadron Collider...

...now under construction, he shall invite
the other friend to accompany him."

Oh, for God's sakes.

You actually put that
in an agreement?

We put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant...

...or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

He can't kill me. Even if I turn.

Is there anything about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

No, that seemed a little far-fetched.

Sheldon, do you really expect
to enforce this?

I've lived up to my commitments
under the agreement.

At least once a day I ask how you are,
even though I simply don't care.

I no longer stage spontaneous
biohazard drills after 10 p.m.

And I abandoned my goal
to master Tuvan throat singing.

- I shouldn't ask, but what is...?
- No.

I'd be much further along
if I'd been allowed to practice.

Look, Sheldon,
I know it's in the agreement.

If you turn into a zombie,
I promise I will not kill you.

In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.
But I'm taking Penny to Switzerland.

- Is that your final decision?
- It is.

Very well.

It's not over, is it?

What do you think?

Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?

Think it's gonna rain?

Instead of underpants, I covered
my crotch with potato salad. Thoughts?

I know what'll cheer you up.
Let's play one of your driving games.

All right. This game is called Traitors.

I will name three historical figures...

...put them in order
of the heinousness of their betrayal:

Benedict Arnold, Judas,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

You really think I belong
with Benedict Arnold and Judas?

You're right. Judas had the decency
to hang himself after what he did.

Can't you at least try to understand
how much this means to me?

Round two: Leonard Hofstadter,
Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.

Rupert Murdoch?

<i>He owns Fox
and they cancelled Firefly.</i>

Hint: He and Darth Vader
are tied for number two.

Sorry, I couldn't hang with you.
I had a date with Bernadette.

I know. I saw the tweet.

- So, what did you end up doing?
- Not much. Nuked a burrito...

...prayed to Hindu god Urvashi
your bowels'd loosen...

...and your penis would droop
like a willow tree.

- You seen Sheldon?
- No.

- Is he still mad about the Super Collider?
- Yeah, he thinks I betrayed him.

What would you guys do
if you were me?

I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.

- Seriously?
- Absolutely. And I'd leave him there.

What the hell is that?

Uh, let's see.

Yep, 30 pieces of silverware.

Morning, old chum.

- What's going on?
- I've made you breakfast.

Juice, coffee...

...and pancakes in the shape of some
of your favorite fictional characters.

See, here's Frodo.

- You made Frodo pancakes?
- Yeah, I used coconut shavings...

...to do the hair on his feet.

If you need to void your bladder
before eating...

...I can keep them warm with this beret
that I thoroughly laundered...

...and pressed into service
as a pancake cozy.

Why are you doing this?

It's by way of an apology
for my recent behavior.

I've had some time to reflect
and I've come to realize...

...that friendship is not an aggregation
of written agreements.

It's the result of two people
respecting and caring for each other.

- Butterscotch scone?
- Thanks.

- It's good.
- What you're tasting is respect...

...and affection.

And about a pound of Crisco.

After breakfast,
I thought we could spend the day...

<i>...watching the final season of Babylon 5
with director commentary.</i>

<i>You hate Babylon 5.</i>

I do. It fails as drama, science fiction
and it's hopelessly derivative.

But you like it, and you're my friend.

Okay, great.

- Still not taking you to Switzerland.
- Drat.

No Frodo for you.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Let's dispense
with the friendly banter.

I believe you know why I'm here.

Well, I always figured
it was to study us...

...discover our weaknesses,
and report back to your alien overlords.

Yes, amusing.

Extraordinary intelligence might well
appear extraterrestrial to you...

...but let me be more specific.

I believe you know why I'm here
in the laundry room.

Better acoustics
for your throat singing?

It's actually not bad.

But my true purpose in being here
will be revealed...

...in this brief PowerPoint presentation.
Ahem. Lights.

"Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD...

...should go to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider:

A PowerPoint presentation
by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."

Oh, for God's sakes.

Here, we have a highly gifted researcher
in the field of particle physics...

...whose work has brought him
to the precipice...

...of forever changing mankind's
understanding of the universe, a.k.a. me.

And here, we have a waitress
brushing her teeth with her finger.

A.k.a. you.

Sorry.
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?

Please hold all questions
until the end of the presentation.

This is the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Switzerland.

The product of decades
of planning and construction.

It is a mecca
for physicists the world over.

This is Bath and Body Works
on Colorado Boulevard.

They sell scented soaps and lotions.
Some of which contain glitter.

Now, let's see
if we can match the individual...

...to the appropriate destination.

Okay. Show's over.

No, it's not. I've got five more slides.

Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.

He invited me to Switzerland
and I intend to go.

Very well.

Enjoy yourself.

You're gonna be in the presence of
something I've dreamed of for decades.

I hope you'll appreciate...

...the magnitude of where you are,
and what it represents.

I'll talk to Leonard.

- You will?
- Yes.

If it means that much to you,
you should go.

Oh, Penny, thank you.

- You're welcome.
- Since I rarely hug...

...I'm relying on your expertise
regarding duration.

- I think we're there.
- Oh, good.

Bye-bye.

Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I
can still have a good time on Valentine's.

Trust me, you can't. I've tried.

No, no, no.
I'm gonna have a "me" day.

I'm gonna go
to one of those spas in Koreatown...

...take a steam, get a massage.

Then I'm gonna stop at a pet store
and get licked by puppies.

- Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
- All right, my friend.

Would you like some cholermus?

- Some what?
- Cholermus.

It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.

I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.

- You're not going to Switzerland.
- Oh, but I am.

Didn't Penny tell you the good news?

You went behind my back to guilt her
into letting you go instead of her.

Yes, that good news.

Forget it. I was the one invited,
I get to decide who goes with me.

And it's Penny, not you.

Howard, could you lower the lights?
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.

I don't need to see your presentation.
This discussion is over.

Well, that's a somewhat
ambiguous response. Am I going or not?

Sheldon, at this point...

...I would go by myself
before I would take you.

- Really?
- Yeah, really.

Well, then.
You leave me no alternative.

From this moment forward,
we can be roommates...

...but we will no longer be friends.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

I don't think you're fully aware
of the ramifications here, Leonard.

Why don't you enlighten me?

With the friendship clause
of our agreement nullified...

...you're no longer entitled
to accompany me to go swimming...

...at Bill Gates' house
should I be invited.

Ooh, that's gotta sting.

Think, this time tomorrow,
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland...

- ...for our first Valentine's Day.
- I know.

I went shopping today and bought
special undies for the occasion.

Thermal? Because it's gonna be cold.

Think it through, Leonard.

- Oh.
- Oh.

Gesundheit.

Or as they say in Switzerland,
gesundheit.

- Getting a cold?
- No, no, it's probably just allergies.

You want an allergy pill?
I have them all.

Prescription, nonprescription, foreign,
domestic, experimental.

Do any of them work?

Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.

Penny?

You okay?

Did that sound okay to you?

Do not come in here.

What's going on?

I'm having a tea party.
What do you think is going on?

I think I might have the flu.

Or the plague.

Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m.
Do you think you'll feel better by then?

Yep. Because I'm gonna be dead.

Hey, Sheldon?

Listen, Penny's sick and she's not
gonna be able to go to Switzerland...

...so if you're still interested,
you're welcome to come.

Great. I'll start packing.

In a minute.

Oh, look, it's the cholermus.

Ugh. Here's your soup.

- Chicken?
- Yes.

- With the little stars?
- Yes.

Heated to 180 degrees?

Why don't I pour it in your lap
and you can tell me?

You don't have to be mean. I'm sick.

- Yeah, well, I'm sick too.
- Not my problem.

I don't understand
how this happened to me.

I'm scrupulous about my hygiene,
I regularly disinfect my hands...

...and I avoid contact with other people
on general principle.

I don't know what to tell you,
Sheldon.

Oh, Penny, thank you.

You're welcome.

It's you. I touched you.

Happy Valentine's Day.

Oh, my goodness, look at this room.

Champagne, roses,
oh, and little chocolates.

This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

Yeah, I forgot about all this.

But I never will.

Will you please turn your shirt off?

What? I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.

People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.

Right. There's nothing more awesome
and frightening...

...than a man who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.

- Hey, Stuart. What's going on?
- Well, you might wanna mark...

...your Google calendars. Stan Lee
is coming to do a signing on Thursday.

Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?

I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.

No, just a regular comic signing.

My uncle is his dermatologist,
and Stan's doing him a favor.

Oh, I don't wanna know that.

How can I possibly discuss with
Stan Lee the scientific foundations...

...for interstellar flight on a surfboard
when part of my brain...

...will be scanning his face
for signs of contagious skin disease?

Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.

Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.

Can't believe it.
We're gonna meet Stan Lee.

<i>I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it</i>

<i>I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it</i>

I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.

I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph...

<i>...my Journey Into Mystery 83,
first appearance of Thor...</i>

<i>...or my Fantastic FourNumber 5,
first appearance of Dr. Doom.</i>

Alex, I'm gonna go with:
"What is you're a dumb-ass?"

<i>I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee
sign my copy of this month's Batman.</i>

<i>That's crazy. Stan Lee
had nothing to do with Batman.</i>

Which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one.

I'll be the possessor of a unique,
albeit confusing artifact...

...which will set me apart from
the hoi polloi of comic-book fandom.

<i>That's a great idea. I'm gonna get him
to sign a Batman as well.</i>

What is it about the word "unique"
you don't understand?

Ow! Damn. Paper cut.
Nothing worse than a paper cut.

Well, obviously,
you don't remember your circumcision.

There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.

Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?

He does. And in the kitchen,
and in the car, and in his pocket.

Yeah, but the ones in my pocket
are mine.

- Hi.
- Hey.

Guess who's gonna be
at the comic store on Thursday.

- Um, can you give me a hint?
- Stan Lee.

Um, Stanley. Stanley. Stanley Tucci?

No, ha, ha. No. Stan Lee.

Oh. Oh, Stan Lee. Cool.

You have no idea who he is, do you?

Of course I do.
You're an important part of my life...

...and I pay attention to the things
you are interested in.

- Good. Good.
- Heh, heh.

So who's Stan Lee?

<i>Um, he was on Star Trek.</i>

<i>- No.
- Star Wars?</i>

No.

Um, Stan Lee. Oh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?

That's Bruce Lee.

Oh.

So is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?

Sheldon, why do you have all these
unopened paychecks in your desk?

Because most of the things I'm planning
to buy haven't been invented yet.

There must be thousands
of dollars here.

- Why don't you put it in the bank?
- I don't trust banks.

I believe that when the robots rise up,
ATMs will lead the charge.

You've also got something
from the Pasadena Municipal Court.

Undoubtedly yet another snide response
to my repeated letters...

...complaining that the flags in front of
the courthouse are in the wrong order.

It's supposed to be federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.

I'm sorry, you sent more than one letter
about that?

It bothers me.

- Sheldon, this is a summons.
- A summons? For what?

Looks like you ran a red light...

...on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16th.

They got you on a traffic camera.
Nice picture.

November 16th? Penny, that's
the evening you fell in your bathtub.

I had to drive you
to the emergency room.

No, it isn't.

- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

I have an eidetic memory. That's
a picture of you in the passenger seat...

...holding your dislocated shoulder.

Hmm. No, it isn't.

Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation...

...committed in your car, bearing
your license plates, coming to me?

Okay, look, they sent me the ticket.

I told them I wasn't driving,
and they were all, "Who was it?"

- So you betrayed me.
- No.

It wasn't a betrayal.

It was more of a, I can't afford
any more points on my license.

I already have to buy my insurance
from this place in the Cayman Islands.

But the only reason
I was driving your car...

...was because you were in distress,
and I was rescuing you.

Yes. And look, now you have a photo
to remember that heroic day.

It's not that big a deal.

You just go down to the court on Thursday,
and you pay the fine.

I'm not going to pay a fine.
That would imply I'm guilty.

You are guilty.

- That one I liked.
- Yeah.

I am not guilty.
I only have a learner's permit.

Penny was the teacher.
When the light turned yellow...

...she said, "Go, go, go,"
so I went, went, went.

Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy
to reimburse you for the fine.

You know, as soon as I get a part
in a movie or my own TV series.

You don't need to reimburse me.
I'm not paying.

On Thursday, I will have my day in court,
and justice will be done.

In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.

Okay, he's going to jail.

Oh, that's right.
Thursday's Stan Lee day.

Now you see what you've done?

Because of you,
we're all going to miss Stan Lee.

Whoa!

- What do you mean "all"?
- Well, you're my friends.

You'll be standing by my side,
supporting me...

...feeding me legal precedents,
and, if you have the strength...

...carrying me out on your shoulders
when I'm victorious.

Yeah, okay, no.

Are you saying that you will not stand
beside me as I plead my case?

That's what I'm saying.

- Howard?
- Wow. Ahem.

Uh, Stan Lee or you in court.

<i>Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice,
it would've been a much shorter movie. No.</i>

Raj, you'll be there, won't you?

All right, then,
my so-called friends have forsaken me.

So I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

Oh, balls.

Try to wear something appropriate.
It won't help my case if the judge...

...is busy trying to read the word "Juicy"
scrawled across your buttocks.

Penny. Penny.

Penny.

- That's just wrong.
- All right, let's go.

Wait. Hold on.
Before we get to the courthouse...

...I'd like to call on your skills
as an actress.

What is this?

I've taken the liberty of scripting
your appearance on the witness stand.

You're somewhat of a loose cannon.

Don't worry, it's written
in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?

- Do I have a choice?
- Of course you have a choice.

Although we live in a deterministic
universe, each individual has free will.

Now, sit down.

"I call your attention
to the events of November 16th.

Do you remember that date?"

"Darn tooting, I do.

If the court will excuse my homespun,
corn-fed, Nebraskan turn of phrase."

- Excellent. Go on.
- "The reason that date is, like...

...so totally fixed in my memory is that
I had the privilege to be witness...

...to one of the most heroic acts
I've ever seen in, like, ever."

"And who performed that heroic act?"

"Why, you did, sir.
You, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

And may I add,
it is a privilege to know you."

"T here's no need for compliments.
This court is only interested in the facts."

"But it is a fact
that it's a privilege to know you.

Totally."

"A teardrop rolls down my cheek"?

Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat
would work just as well.

"But it is a fact
that it's a privilege to know you.

Totally."

Maybe you should put on
your Juicy pants again.

Pay the cashier.

Sheldon Cooper.

Good morning, Your Honor.

<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.
That is to say, representing himself.</i>

I know what it means.
I went to law school.

And yet you wound up in traffic court.

If it would please the court,
I'd like to begin with an opening statement.

The court would advise you
to make it quick.

The court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito and just took an Imodium.

Very well. A quick opening statement.

Like a milking stool,
my case rests on three legs.

I will demonstrate that
I was improperly instructed in driving...

...by a woman whose lack of respect
for society borders on the sociopathic.

I will argue that the emergency
met the legal doctrine...

<i>...of quod est necessarium est licitum,
that which is necessary is legal.</i>

But first,
I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.

I am unable to confront my accuser,
a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.

So to sum up, improper instruction...

<i>...quod est necessarium est licitum,
Sixth Amendment.</i>

My milk stool is complete.

- Impressive.
- Thank you.

Guilty. Pay the cashier.

I object.
You're completely ignoring the law.

No, I'm following the law.
I'm ignoring you.

Really? I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession...

...while you preside
over the kiddie table of yours.

Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt
and throw you in jail...

...I'm gonna give you a chance
to apologize for that last remark.

I'm a scientist.
I never apologize for the truth.

That's my spot.

I can't wait to ask Stan Lee
why he insists on giving his characters...

...first and last names
that start with the same letter.

Oh, come on. Why would you do that?

Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange...

...Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer,
Peter Parker.

Oh, and worst of all,
J. Jonah Jameson Jr.

Okay, I'm cutting.

I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

- Hey.
- Sheldon's in jail.

- Sheldon's in jail?
- You called it.

<i>- For what?
- What do you think?</i>

For doing the same crap he always does,
except to a judge.

- He has to stay there until he apologizes.
- So tell him to apologize.

Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.
That didn't occur to me.

If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,
he's gonna spend the night in jail.

Oh, no, that's terrible.
The line's moving. Gotta go. Bye.

Excuse me. Excuse me, jailor?

- What?
- I need to use the restroom.

Knock yourself out.

- That's the toilet?
- Well, it ain't a wishing well.

Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

Look at that.

"To my friend Leonard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

Awesome. Mine says:

"To my friend Howard.
From Stan Lee. Excelsior!"

Mine says, "To Raj. From Stan Lee."

That's because you pissed him off
about his character names.

I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan...

...or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts, Victor von Doom.

Oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.

We're home.

- Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?
- You know very well how it went.

Yeah. But we all wanna
hear it from you.

- I was found guilty and fined $533.
- I'm gonna write you a check for that.

As long as you promise to put it in your
drawer and never cash it like the others.

I also now have three points on
a driver's license I do not yet possess...

...and I was forced to issue
an undeserved apology...

...because I refused to urinate in
a stainless-steel bowl in front of criminals.

Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.

Okay, that's enough, Howard.
The poor guy's had a tough time.

He had to spend the entire afternoon
in jail wearing that suit.

It would be cruel to mention that,
after he finished signing autographs...

...Stan Lee took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

You had gelato with Stan Lee?

He said we could call him Stan.

Except for Raj.

Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny.

You are responsible for all the evil
that has befallen me today.

- I realize...
- Not finished.

It is because of you
that I now have a criminal record.

And it is because of you that I missed out
on having gelato with Stan Lee.

- Maybe you'll have another chance...
- No.

I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

...because opportunities
to have gelato with Stan Lee...

...come but once in a lifetime.

The moving finger writes
and, having writ, moves on.

Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

Not just the finger, the moving finger.

Hey, Stuart.

Oh, hey, Penny. Wow.

Hi.

- What's going on?
- Nothing.

I'm just getting ready to close up
and head out.

- Cool. Got any fun plans?
- Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

Gonna share a can of tuna
with the cat.

Oh, nice.

Not even my cat. I just feed it.
Some nights, it doesn't even show up.

Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um,
you could do me a favor.

Sure, yeah. Name it.

I'm kind of responsible
for Sheldon missing Stan Lee.

I really wanna make it up to him.
I was hoping...

...you could give me his number
so I can arrange for them to meet.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have his phone number.

Damn. All right. Thank you.

Mm-hm.

Wait.

I have his address.

Really? Great.

But I can't give it to you.

- Then why did you tell me you had it?
- I don't know. Just chatting.

You're looking at a guy who could very well
get stood up by a stray cat tonight.

I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.

Mm-hm.

Wait.

- Yeah?
- Maybe we can make a deal.

What kind of deal?

I will give you the address if you go
to my cousin's wedding with me.

- You're extorting a date out of me?
- I kind of have to.

The cousin who's getting married is
the cousin I usually go to weddings with.

- Can I bring Leonard?
- Sure. What the hell?

- Deal.
- We'll tell people he's your cousin.

This is Stan Lee's front door.

We were on Stan Lee's curb,
then we were on Stan Lee's walk...

- ...and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.
- Yep.

Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's
doorbell at Stan Lee's house.

We're about to go in and
have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

Sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna
have cookies or what's gonna happen...

...so just let me talk and...

Yeah?

- Are you Stan Lee?
- Oh, damn.

Hi. I'm Penny.
This is my friend Sheldon.

We're not friends at the moment.
Depends on how this goes.

Right, right. Anyway,
Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours.

He was supposed to meet you the other
day, but he kind of ended up in jail.

I see. And you thought you'd just
come over to my house uninvited?

You said we were invited.

Oh, no, no. I said I'm inviting you
to come with me to Stan Lee's house.

You know, you fanboys are unbelievable.

Do you think you can just ring
my doorbell anytime you want?

I mean, why don't you just come on in
and watch the Lakers game with me?

Well, I'm not much of a sports fan,
but thank you.

I'm sorry.
He doesn't really understand sarcasm.

Well, I'll give him something
he'll understand.

- Joanie, call the police.
- Nice to meet you.

Fantastic Four, Daredevil...

...Invincible Iron Man,
Happy Hogan, Curt Connors...

Would you just let it go?

And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.

- Hey. Where you been?
- I'll tell you where I've been.

You boys may have had gelato
with Stan Lee...

...and gotten autographed comics,
but I saw the inside of his house...

...and got an autographed application
for a restraining order.

Sweet.

Plus, I get to hang out with him again,
at the hearing.

This is going to look great...

...hanging next to my restraining order
from Leonard Nimoy.

Why do I always have
to carry the heavy stuff?

Well, it's very simple.

In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose...

...I'm the smart one.
Wolowitz is the funny one.

Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner...

...who struggles to understand our ways
and fails.

That leaves you, by default,
as the muscle.

One more floor
and I'd be the pulled muscle.

Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.

Uh, well,
we didn't actually get Chinese food.

- Why not?
- Don't panic. This is better.

Oh, no. You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?

Of course not. And, technically,
magic beans would be food.

Eating them would be a waste,
since you could plant them...

...and have a giant beanstalk which
would provide roughage for a small city.

Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

Sometimes I just watch your jaw
go up and down.

We were on our way to the restaurant.

We saw Adam West, so we followed him.

- Who's Adam West?
- Who's Adam West?

What do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

My guess is,
"Hey, four minutes. New record."

That's why I'm the funny one.

Anyway, we followed the guy
to this garage sale.

They had the coolest stuff.

They were closing up.
We got this whole box for 60 bucks.

We didn't go through it.
There could be anything.

There a new girlfriend in there?
You might need one.

<i>No, but there is an original final draft
Ghostbusters script...</i>

...with actual slime stains.

<i>Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters Il.
Never mind.</i>

Oh, my God.

An ALF doll.

When I was 11, my mother got me one
to help me sleep after my dad left.

I used to pretend that my dad
had moved to the planet Melmac...

...and ALF was gonna bring him back
to me.

But he never did.

Where's my daddy, puppet?

Where is he?

That is so sad.

No, what's sad is that you don't know
that Adam West was TV's Batman.

Here's Spock's head with no body.

Here's Mr. T's body with no head.

Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body
with Mr. T's head.

"I pity the fool who's illogical."

I'm just gonna go home
and make a grilled cheese...

...and window-shop on eHarmony.

- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

<i>Ooh, look,
an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.</i>

And an Aquaman action figure.

Looks like someone drew a penis on him.

Eh. That'll come off.

You see what you're doing? Stop that.

- Fascinating.
- What?

<i>- It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
- Oh.</i>

It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.

It's not Elvish.

It's the language of Mordor
written in Elvish script.

"One ring to rule them all."

"One ring to find them."

"One ring to bring them all."

"And in the darkness, bind them."

Holy crap, are we nerdy.

So I was doing some checking
on the ring...

Hold on. Sheldon,
is there ketchup on that table?

Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact.

Ketchup started out as a general term
for sauce...

...typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine with herbs and spices.

Some popular early main ingredients
included blueberry, anchovy...

...oyster, kidney bean and grape.

No, that's okay, I'll get it.

Listen, I was looking at the ring
and it seemed a little weird.

No copyright notice on it.

So I took it down to this buddy of mine
who deals with...

...shall we say, the seedy underbelly
of the collectibles world.

Seedy underbelly?

Uh, your black-market phasers...

...your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura
panties, that kind of stuff.

Who's this mysterious buddy
you suddenly have?

Just a guy. I know a guy.

- Is it Eddie Crispo?
- No, I can't tell you who it is.

- Who else could it be? It has to be.
- I know lots of dangerous people.

- Name one.
- Eddie Crispo.

Anyway, he said this isn't a replica.

It's the real deal.

If you're suggesting that
that is the actual ring of power...

...forged by Sauron in Mount Doom...

...I look at you with an expression
of exhaustion...

...and ever-so-slight amusement.

He's not saying it's a magic ring.

You're not, are you?

No, but it's close.

Look at the markings inside.

Those are production markings.

Nine rings were made
for use in the movies.

Three were given to members
of the cast. The rest were destroyed.

Except one.

One was stolen.

Gentlemen, this is the One Ring.

Mine.

No, it is not yours.
We all went in on the box together.

Yes, but I found it in the box.

And the laws of maritime salvage
clearly state...

...that the finder of a sunken treasure
is the owner.

How is this maritime salvage?

Other than the lack of water,
how is it not?

Wait, Sheldon.
Stop being crazy for a second.

How much is something like this worth?

Well, it's tough to say, since it's hot.

On the underground market,
my guy figures...

- Your guy Eddie Crispo?
- Yes.

<i>- He figures 10-, maybe 15,000.
- Okay, that's a lot of money.</i>

The wise thing to do
is invest it in something practical.

Like a Jet Ski.

Why do you want a Jet Ski?

All the wealthy and beautiful people
in movies ride Jet Skis.

- That can't just be a coincidence.
- Ugh.

We can't sell it. We have to keep it
and love it and polish it.

Take it out occasionally
when we go to the park...

...and reenact our favorite scenes
from the movies.

It's sad how great that sounds.

Guys, it's stolen.
It should go back to Peter Jackson.

- He made the movies. It belongs to him.
- Fine.

He can have it back.

As long as he promises to make me
a hobbit in his next movie.

But there are no Jewish hobbits.

Clearly, you've never been to my house
for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

We are not blackmailing Peter...

- All right, where's the ring?
- You mean my ring?

- What are you doing?
- The ring was unguarded.

It was sitting on the table.
Anyone could've taken it.

Proof? I did.

Give me that.

Be reasonable. We want to do
different things with the ring.

But your ideas are stupid
and I want a Jet Ski.

I found it. The ring is mine.

I don't understand why in this group
I never get my way.

You always get your way.

I'll stipulate to that
if you give me the ring.

Hey. Enjoying your food
that I actually brought you...

...instead of promising food
but bringing you a box of random crap?

Yeah, it's delicious.
The sarcasm's a little stale, though.

How about this? Until we figure out
what to do with the ring, Penny holds it.

- What ring?
- This ring.

Looking for something?

- Will you hold this for a couple of days?
- Why?

It's a prop from a movie
and we're kind of fighting over it.

The first piece of jewelry
my boyfriend gives me...

...is a prop from a movie
and I don't even get to keep it?

If you had gone out with me years ago...

...you'd have my Aunt Ida's brooch...

...that she smuggled
out of occupied Belgium in a cat.

How am I looking now?

You hit me!

I'm bleeding!

What was that?

Sheldon tried to take the ring
and I punched him.

That's my girl.

So, Sheldon, how's it feel
to get beaten up by a girl?

It's not the first time.

I have a twin sister
whose assaults began in utero.

If only I'd had the presence of mind
to reabsorb her.

I'd have a mole with hair in it...

...instead of a tedious
yearly Christmas letter.

Have you come to the realization...

...that the only reasonable action
is to sell the ring and divide the money?

- No.
- I was afraid of that.

Go ahead.

<i>Greetings from Mumbai.</i>

<i>I'm Raj's attorney,
Venkatesh Koothrappali.</i>

Also my cousin.

<i>- You brought a lawyer?
- Don't answer that.</i>

<i>I'll get straight to the point.</i>

<i>My client's prepared to surrender
any interest in the ring...</i>

<i>...in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.</i>

We're not giving him two Jet Skis.

<i>Look, we're big boys. Why don't we just
cut to the chase and meet In the middle?</i>

<i>One Kawasaki Jet Ski. Done and done.</i>

No Jet Skis.

<i>All right, forget the Jet Skis.</i>

Forget the Jet Skis? What happened to
"tear them a new one"?

<i>What can I say?
They played hardball. We lost.</i>

<i>- You're useless.
- I told you that when you hired me.</i>

<i>- I'm signing off now.
- Call your mother. She worries.</i>

So you know, if we're bringing
in cousins who are lawyers...

...prepare for shock and awe.

You know, I am ending this.
Penny didn't wanna hold the ring.

She gave it to me. I have it.
I'm sending it back.

- Where's the ring?
- You mean this ring?

Be aware of your surroundings
while urinating in a public men's room.

- Give me that.
- No, it's mine.

It's all of ours.

Okay, this is ridiculous.

- Then let go!
- I'm not. You let go.

I say this ring belongs to the last person
who can hold on.

Fine. Can't we go home and start?

Sure. Let go of the ring.

All right. It starts now.

You do realize there's a giant-bug movie
marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.

Wait, my laptop.

Yeah, there's a point
when this becomes idiotic.

And it wasn't
when we were driving like this?

I would advise the three of you
that resistance is futile.

I have endless patience.

I spent two and a half hours on hold
with Hewlett-Packard customer service...

...just to complain
about their customer service.

You wanna talk about endless patience?

<i>Penny made me watch all five seasons
of Sex and the City.</i>

There's six seasons, dude.

Oh, crap.

No, no, no, the sixth season is great.

We go to Paris with Carrie
and get our heart broken...

...and then Mr. Big shows up.
We don't know if we can trust him again.

It's a wild ride.

Door.

Okay, everybody, and plié.

And relevé.

What are you doing?

Last one holding the ring
decides its fate.

I know it sounds silly.

No, no, no. You are my boyfriend.
Nothing you do is silly to me.

Thank you.

FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.

I'm out.

I'm sorry, Ma,
I have to stay late at the office.

No, he doesn't. He's lying to you.

Will you be quiet?

Well, if you want privacy,
let go of the ring.

I'm so glad we came
to this gentile strip club.

Howard, here's more bacon
to tuck into the shiksa's G-string.

I'll call you back.

It's lovely you call your mommy
and let her know you're going to be late.

From what I know, if a woman
doesn't breast-feed on time...

...it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.

Don't you talk
about my mother's boobies.

If you're offended, let go of the ring
and go on home to your mother's boobies.

Excellent. Tire each other out.
The ring will be mine.

Howard, why don't you
go after Raj's mother?

Why don't we go after your mother?

Go ahead.
I have no illusions about my mother.

She is a kind, loving,
religiously fanatical right-wing Texan...

...with a slightly out-of-scale head
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

Anything you'd like to add?

That's not gonna get you anywhere.
Better pull out the big gun.

You're right.
Let's talk about your grandmother.

No.

I call no meemaws.

Think about this.

The only way your mother was born
was your meemaw had sex.

- I don't wanna hear this.
- Then let go of the ring and walk away.

- Never.
- All right.

I'll bet your meemaw didn't just have sex
to have your mother...

...I bet she had sex...

...because she liked it.

- Stop it.
- Yeah. Meemaw did the nasty.

- I said stop it!
RAJESH & HOWARD: Ha-ha-ha.

- We're getting to him.
- Waterfalls.

- What?
- Waterfalls.

Crashing waves, babbling brooks.

- What are you doing?
- Subliminal messaging.

I'm going to make you want to pee.

Dripping faucets.

Leaky gutter.

Peeing.

It's not working, dude.

Oh-ho-ho. It's working, all right.

I have to pee.

- Then let go of the ring and go.
- Actually, I wouldn't mind going too. Heh.

Fine, um, on the count of three.

One, two...

Wait, just to clarify,
when you get to three...

...do we stand up or do we pee?

We stand up.

Excellent choice.

Three.

Oh. Something tells me this was a bad day
to wear suede shoes.

I've done it. I've won.

The ring is mine.

It's mine!

We're going to clean it up
and make it pretty.

My own, my love...

...my precious.

Where's the ring?

It's in a FedEx box on its way back
to where it came from.

The fires of Mount Doom?

Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand.
It wasn't ours.

You quit the game.
You had no right to take it.

You guys were sleeping. The ring was
on the floor. No one was touching it.

So we start the game over
until there's a winner.

There wasn't ever going to be a winner.

There was going to be a selfish person...

...and three people
who used to be his friend.

Is that what you guys want? If it is, fine.

I don't want anything to do with you.

I don't know what happened
in that bathroom, but I'm not cleaning it.

My precious.

I knew it.

- Give us the precious.
- Never! Never.

- Give it to me.
- Get off of me.

- Give me the ring.
- It's mine.

I gotta go back to dating dumb guys
from the gym.

- Give it back.
- Give it to me. Give me the ring!

- I said give it to me.
- It's mine!

<i>Okay, in Avatar
when they have sex on Pandora...</i>

...they hook up their ponytails.

So we know their ponytails
are like their junk.

Yeah. So?

When they ride horses
and fly on birds...

- ...they also use their ponytails.
- Your point?

My point is if I were a horse or a bird I'd
be very nervous around James Cameron.

It amazes me how you constantly
obsess over fictional details...

...when there are important things
in the world to worry about.

<i>For example, why wasn't William
Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?</i>

Hey, Sheldon,
I was up in the administration office...

...and I happened to overhear
the name of the winner...

...of the
Chancellor's Award for Science.

You wanna rub my nose in the fact my
contributions are being overlooked again?

I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.

All right, I'll play.

What self-important preening fraud
are they honoring this year?

Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.

- I won?
- You won.

I won.

This is astonishing.

Not that I won the award.
No one deserves it more.

Actually, I guess I misspoke.
It's not astonishing.

It's more like inevitable.

Not sure what to do.
Maybe call my mother.

Wait. I'm gonna conduct
an interview with myself...

...and post it online.

Well, good for him.

Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner...

...of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.

Did it look like that spear was gonna
go right through your skull?

No.

Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee
at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.

Oh. That will be another
congratulatory call for me.

- Mute, please.
- Wait. Hang on. Flaming arrow.

Hello?

Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?

Yes, I was expecting your call.
Three years ago.

I see.

What happens if
I choose not to give a speech?

Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit
the award?

Well, you've got that tied up
in a neat little bow.

All right, thank you.

- Problem.
- What?

They expect me to give a speech
at the banquet.

I can't give a speech.

Well, no, you're mistaken.
You give speeches all the time.

What you can't do is shut up.

Yeah, before the movie,
you did 20 minutes...

...on why guacamole turns brown.

Turned brown
while you were talking.

I'm perfectly comfortable speaking
to small groups.

I cannot speak to large crowds.

What to you is a large crowd?

Any group big enough
to trample me to death.

General rule of thumb is 36 adults
or 70 children.

Sheldon. Congratulations.

Brought you cheesecake from work.

You know, because of your award,
not because that busboy sneezed on it.

- I'm not accepting the award.
- Why not?

Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper
has stage fright.

That's no reason to back out.

I once got a pretty big
honor in high school.

I was terrified about appearing
in front of a big crowd...

...but I went through with it.
You know?

The world looked pretty darn good
sitting on a haystack...

...in the back of a Ford F-150 as a
member of the corn queen's court.

Thank you. I'll bear that in mind...

...if I'm ever nominated
for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

- Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

Let me tell you a story.

Where's 70 children
when you need them?

I was 14 and graduating
summa cum laude from college.

"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."

I just love how you always skip over
the part where no one asks.

I was valedictorian
and expected to give an address.

Even now I can remember
that moment...

...when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.

There must have been
thousands of people.

My heart started pounding
in my chest.

I began to hyperventilate.

My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it...

Oh, dear.

- Oh, my God.
- Sheldon?

- Sheldon, are you okay?
- Don't trample me.

Come on, Mother, you know
why I can't accept the award.

With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.

No, I have not heard the song
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."

No, no, no.
You don't need to start singing it.

Yes, I'll buy it on "the iTunes,"
Mother.

Goodbye, Mother.

Hello.

- Sit down. We wanna talk to you.
- Am I in trouble?

Did my mother call you?

Just sit.

We think we can help you
with your stage fright.

Oh, I doubt that.

I haven't figured out a way
and I'm much smarter than all of you.

Yes, but you're not smarter
than all of us put together.

Oh, I'm sorry.
That is what I meant.

Okay. Your problem is
you're trying to do this all by yourself.

We could help you.
We can be your team.

Like Professor Xavier
and his X-Men.

I do like the X-Men.

<i>Did I see X-Men?</i>

Yeah, we watched it last week.
You said you liked it.

Oh, I say a lot of things, sweetie.

So how about it, Sheldon?

I don't know. If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

Okay, well, I'm gonna take you
shopping, get you a nice suit.

- Might give you more confidence.
- It's not exactly a mutation...

...that would get you into Xavier's
School for Gifted Youngsters...

...but go on. Leonard?

I thought I could try to analyze you
and get to the root of your anxiety.

What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?

My mother is a highly regarded
psychiatrist...

...and I've been in therapy
ever since...

...she accused me
of breast feeding co-dependently.

And Raj says he can teach you...
What did you call it?

I don't know,
some Indian meditation crap.

I see. I assume since the rest of you
have set the bar so low...

...you're saving the most impressive
contribution for last.

Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

My power is the ability to pretend
like I give a damn...

...about your piddly-ass problems.

And that's 24/7, buddy.

And I appreciate the pretense.

So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?

No. The X-Men were named
for the X in Charles Xavier.

Since I am Sheldon Cooper,
you will be my C-Men.

Oh, that's not a good name.

Okay, Sheldon...

...I'm going to be leading you through
a series of meditation exercises.

These methods come
from the ancient gurus of India...

...and have helped me
overcome my own fears.

And yet you can't speak to women.

But thanks to meditation...

...I'm able to stay in the same room
with them without urinating.

Now, ahem, close your eyes.

Okay, but don't punch me.

- What?
- When I was little my sister would say:

"Close your eyes,
you'll get a surprise."

And then she'd punch me.

- I'm not going to punch you.
- That's what my sister used to say.

- Look, do you wanna do this or not?
- I'm sorry. Proceed.

All right, ahem...

...imagine yourself in the one place
you feel most at home.

- Where is that?
- SimCity.

More specifically, the SimCity
I designed, Sheldonopolis.

Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

Where exactly? Sheldon Square?

Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium,
home of the fighting Sheldons?

Whatever you like.

I thought this was supposed to be
guided meditation.

Fine, you're in Sheldon Square.

Really? This time of the year?
It's a bit nippy.

Then put on a sweater.

Suppose I could run downtown
and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

Yeah. Whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.

The nice thing about Shel-Mart is
I own it, so I get a 15 percent discount.

You own the damn thing,
just take a freaking sweater.

I didn't turn a profit last quarter...

...by taking product off the shelves
willy-nilly.

All right.

You've paid for a sweater
and you're in Sheldon Square.

Ahem. Hang on.

It's a cardigan, I have to button it.

- Oh, no.
- What now?

A Godzilla-like monster
is approaching the city.

I have to get my people to safety.

People of Sheldonopolis,
this is your mayor.

Follow me.

If the children can't run,
leave them behind.

Oh, the simulated horror.

Raj?

Just as I suspected.

Meditation is nothing but hokum.

I question your premise.

How is a new suit going to prevent me
from passing out...

...in front of a ballroom
full of people?

It'll give you confidence.

Sometimes when I'm feeling
stressed out...

...I go out and buy a cute top
or a fun skirt...

...and I have a whole new outlook
on life.

Don't you eventually realize
you're the same stressed-out person...

...in a cute top or a fun skirt?

Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

Now, let's see what we got.

Oh. This is nice.

It's only one color.

Yes, so?

That's a lot of money
for only one color.

Fine. Why don't you pick out
what you like?

Hmm.

This is pretty sharp.

No. You're wrong.

This is great.

I had a suit like this when I was six.

Okay, I think we have a winner.

- Where the hell did you find that?
- In the prom department.

It's ridiculous.

Says the former member
of the corn queen's court.

- Please just try this one on?
- Okay.

But anything I put on now
is only gonna suffer in comparison.

This is absurd. I look like a clown.

So, Sheldon...

...how you doing?

That's how you start
a psychotherapy session?

How am I doing?

I was promised a riverboat journey
into the jungles of my subconscious.

Instead I get the same question...

...I hear from the lady
who slices my bologna at Ralph's.

I'm sorry. I'll start again.

Would it be helpful to you
if I told you about my dreams?

Um... I don't know, maybe.

I recently had a dream
that I was a giant.

But everything around me
was to scale so it all looked normal.

Well, how did you know you were
a giant if everything was to scale?

I was wearing size a million pants.

- Why don't we just talk?
- Ah. The talking cure.

Classical Freudian. Good choice.

If it will help speed things along...

...my answers to the standard
Rorschach inkblot test are:

A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat...

...and D, my father killing my mother
with a hypodermic needle.

Why don't I just start?

Sometimes people have trouble
accepting accolades...

...if on a subconscious level,
they don't feel they deserve them.

Do you think maybe
that's what's happening here?

Really, Leonard?

You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?

I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

And she'd let me taste some pieces
of cheese for free.

But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.

When I was 8, I won a ribbon
at the science fair for my project...

...Do Lima Beans Grow Better
to Classical Music.

But my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash...

...of my brother's earlier...

...Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n ' Roll.

I felt so guilty
I gave the ribbon back.

And how did that make you feel?

Terrible.

I worked really hard on that project.

I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from Pagliacci...

...to a lima bean sprout.

Go on.

It wasn't my fault.

I had never seen
my brother's project.

And my mother could've told me
before...

...instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.

So I hear you saying you're angry
with your mother.

Damn right,
I'm angry with my mother.

For God's sake,
I was 8 years old.

She humiliated me.

That's when the bed-wetting
started again.

- Thank you, Leonard.
- For what?

If someone as damaged as you
can find his way...

...to crawl out of bed each morning...

...I think I can face
a simple awards ceremony.

Wait, that's it?
I thought we had a whole hour.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

It is my great honor
to introduce the winner...

...of this year's Chancellor's Award
for Science, and my good friend...

...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

But before I do,
I'd like to share with you a letter...

...from Sheldon's mother,
who couldn't be here tonight.

Isn't that nice?
His mother sent him a letter.

She's proud of him.

Wonder what that feels like.

"Dear Shelly."

That's what she calls him.
Shelly. It's a pet name.

You know what my mother's
pet name for me is? Leonard.

But I digress.

- "Dear Shelly, I am so proud..."
- Oh, dear.

- What's the matter?
- I'm getting dizzy.

Don't worry.
You're surrounded by your C-Men.

I can't do this. I'm going to faint.

All right, drink this. It'll relax you.

- Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.
- Fine, faint.

I don't feel different.
This alcohol's defective.

Here. See if this one works.

First of all,
the projects were totally different.

I was showing that classical music
nurtures lima beans...

...and makes them grow.
But my mother didn't hear me.

If you look at the relationship
between nurturing and growth...

...I'd like to point out that my brother
is 8 inches taller than me.

I'm ready!

Right.

Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor...

...Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Thanks, shorty. I'll take it from here.

All right,
you people ready to have some fun?

You have an understanding
of differential calculus...

...and at least one year
of algebraic topology?

Well, here come the jokes.

Why did the chicken
cross the Mobius strip?

To get to the same side?
Buzzinga.

A neutron walks into a bar and asks,
"How much for a drink?"

The bartender says,
"For you, no charge."

Hello? I know you're out there.

I can hear you metabolizing oxygen
and expelling carbon dioxide.

It looks like we have some
academic dignitaries in the audience.

Dr. Randall
from the geology department...

...only man who's happy
when they take his work for granite.

Bada-cha.

I kid the geologists, of course...

...but it's only because
I have no respect for the field.

Let's get serious for a moment.

Why are we all here?

Because we're scientists.

And what do scientists study?

The universe.

And what's the universe made of?

I am so glad you asked.

<i>There's antimony, arsenic
Aluminum, selenium</i>

<i>Hydrogen and oxygen
And nitrogen and rhenium</i>

<i>And nickel, neodymium
Neptunium, germanium</i>

Everybody!

<i>And Iron, americium
Ruthenium, uranium</i>

<i>Europium, zirconium
Lutetium, vanadium</i>

Just the Asians!

<i>And lanthanum and osmium
And astatine and radium</i>

Penny, Leonard.

Would you be able to answer
some questions I'm having...

...about the events of last night?

- Sure.
- Question one.

Where are my pants?

You might wanna check YouTube.

- What do I search?
- It's already loaded. Just hit play.

<i>All right, people,
let's get down to the math.</i>

<i>It Is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.</i>

<i>Can I take my pants off
over my head?</i>

<i>Of course not,
my body's In the way.</i>

<i>But If we had access
to higher dimensions...</i>

<i>...we could move our pants
around our bodies...</i>

<i>...through the fourth dimension...</i>

<i>...and our days of dropping trousers
would be over.</i>

Oh, Lord, this couldn't be
any more humiliating.

Oh. Give it a minute.

<i>Now for the astronomers
In the audience...</i>

<i>...get ready to see the dark side
of the moon.</i>

<i>And here's Uranus.</i>

Having a little trouble
catching your breath, there?

No, I'm good. If my P.E. teachers had
told me this is what I was training for...

...I would have tried a lot harder.

Do or do not, there is no try.

<i>Heh. Did you just quote Star Wars?</i>

<i>I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.</i>

Ha, ha. Oh, my God.

I am lying in bed with a beautiful woman
who can quote Yoda.

I love you, Penny.

Uh... Heh.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

- I just wanted to put that out there.
- Oh, yeah. No, I...

- I'm glad.
- Yeah... Oh, good.

- Good. Glad is good.
- Yeah.

Ha. Ahem.

No... Um...

So, heh...

It's getting pretty late.
We should, tsk, go to sleep.

- Yeah.
- Okay.

Yeah, probably.

- Okay. Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

Hey, Leonard,
where do you come down on giant ants?

Sheldon says impossible,
Howard and I say not only possible...

...but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than the Batmobile.

You are ignoring the square-cube law.

The giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its exoskeleton.

For the record, the appropriate ranking
of cool modes of transportation...

...is jetpack, hover board, transporter,
Batmobile and then giant ant.

Seriously, you have nothing better
to do than sit around...

...and discuss the possibility
of giant ants?

- What's with him?
- Perhaps he's at a sensitive point...

...in his monthly cycle.

Are you saying he's man-struating?

Not literally.

But as far back as the 17th century...

...scientists observed a 33-day
fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

Interesting.

That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

You know what I'm talking about.

Okay, forget giant ants.

How about giant rabbits?

Big or small, I don't like rabbits.

They always look like they're about
to say something, but they never do.

Rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size.

On a side note,
they are one of the few mammals...

...whose scrotum
is in front of the penis.

Maybe that's
what they wanna talk about.

Leonard, where do you stand
on giant rabbits and scrotal position?

I honestly don't care.

Really? Every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals...

...you've always had some pretty strong
and controversial opinions.

What do you want?
I just don't give a rat's ass.

Would that be a giant rat's ass?

For the record, giant rats are possible.

Can we please talk
about something else?

Maybe something vaguely related
to life as we know it on this planet?

Okay, how about this for a topic:
"Why is Leonard being a giant douche?"

Assuming giant douches are possible.

Of course they are.
Leonard's being one.

- Maybe he's having a spat with Penny.
- No. There was no spat.

- Oh, but something happened.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

But I sense you're going to and
I don't wanna hear about it. Excuse me.

What'd you do, Romeo?

Did you pour maple syrup
all over your body...

...and ask her if she was in the mood
for a short stack?

Think it would be funny
to put on her panties and jump around...

...but it wound up
just creeping her out?

- What? No.
- Just asking, dude.

It happens.

You guys still on for bowling tonight?

Oh, yes. In fact, I've prepared
some trash talk for the occasion. Ahem.

You bowl like your mama.

Unless she bowls well.
In which case, you bowl nothing like her.

Oh. Ouch.

That is what is referred to
as "a burn on you."

- Did you ask her to start waxing?
- No.

- Did you start waxing?
- No.

While making love,
did you accidentally spank your own ass...

...and cry out, "Mommy"

I'm walking away from you now.

- That wasn't a no.
- Yeah. Think we're getting close.

Did you take a Benadryl
and fall asleep while pleasuring her?

Because you can die that way.

Oh, that would be a good way to go.

- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

Good, Penny.
Reminder, bowling tonight at 7:00.

Oh, right. Bowling.

You don't have to come
if you don't want.

No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it,
you would get creamed without me.

We would indeed.
In this particular case...

...your lack of femininity
works to our advantage.

Yeah. It's always nice chatting with you,
Sheldon.

- Sarcasm?
- Thinly veiled contempt.

- Remember, 7:00.
- Got it.

- Pacific Daylight Time.
- Bite me.

Please reserve that butch spirit
for the lanes.

I thought you were bringing
your own bowling shoes.

These are my own bowling shoes.

Then what's with the disinfectant?

I know where my feet have been.

Hey, Penny.

And you guys.

Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute.

I believe some of you
know Wil Wheaton.

Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

Well, well, well,
if it isn't Wil Wheaton.

The Green Goblin to my Spider-Man.

The Pope Paul V to my Galileo.

The Internet Explorer to my Firefox.

Not carrying a grudge because I beat you
at that card tournament, are you?

I'm the proud owner
of Wil-Wheaton-stinks.com...

...dot-net and dot-org.
What does that tell you?

It tells me that I am living rent-free
right here.

- You ready to bowl?
- Oh, I'm ready.

I don't know if Stuart told you
what you're up against...

...but before you stands the co-captain
of the East Texas Christian Youth...

...Holy Roller Bowling League
Championship team.

Seven-to-12-year-old division.

Also, Penny's pretty good.

Great. Then it's on.

Foolish Wil Wheaton.

It was never off.

Yes!

A common spare.

The Miss Congeniality
of the bowling pageant.

Before you jump on Twitter
to tout your modest accomplishment...

...watch how it's really done.

I am the ball.

My thoughts are its thoughts.

Its holes are my holes.

Yes.

Tweet that, Tweety Bird.

- I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.
- Oh, thanks.

<i>I'm sure you're probably sick
of Star Trek questions...</i>

...but Whoopi Goldberg,
you ever hit that?

Ah. Beer.

The magic elixir that can turn this poor,
shy Indian boy into the life of the party.

Oh, yeah.

- Chili-cheese fry?
- Yes. I love chili-cheese fries.

- Really? You love them?
- Yeah, why?

No reason. Just glad to hear...

...you're comfortable
saying you love something.

- You wanna get into this right now?
- Get into what?

Why wouldn't you love
the chili-cheese fries?

They've been in your life a long time.

They make you happy.
They deserve to know.

Okay, look, you caught me by surprise
last night. I didn't know what to say.

Now you've had time to think about it.
What do you wanna say?

- I'm not sure.
- How can you not be sure?

- This isn't the place to have this.
- No.

The place was in bed after I said,
"I love you"...

...and you said,
"Thank you. Good night."

- Don't push it, Leonard.
- I am not pushing anything.

You are. You don't get to decide
when I'm ready to say "I love you."

Ah. The premature "I love you."

I guessed premature. Does that count?

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

- What?
- This is for you.

- Ice cream?
- I've been familiarizing myself...

...with female emotional crises
by studying the comic strip "Cathy."

When she's upset,
she says "ack" and eats ice cream.

Um...

Ack.

And if you were a cat,
I would have brought you a lasagna.

Did Leonard send you over here?

No. We haven't spoken
since your abrupt departure last night...

...caused us to forfeit to Stuart
and his dastardly ringer, Wil Wheaton.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

Not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

- Again, I'm sorry.
- Let me tell you...

...sleep did not come easily...

...with Leonard in the next room
singing along with Alanis Morissette.

- You're kidding.
- No.

Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

What part of this is supposed
to make me feel better?

The part where I tell you
I've engineered a rematch...

...with Stuart's team for tonight.

Oh, honey, I don't know. Things
are a little weird with Leonard right now.

You want me to remove him from the team?
I'm the captain, I can do that.

No, no, that's okay. Just let me
talk to him and I'll get back to you.

- When are you going to talk to him?
- I don't know.

He's in the laundry room now.
Now would be a good time.

You're not gonna leave me
until I do it?

Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

- I think we should talk now.
- What? No, it's okay.

We don't have to talk because
there's nothing to talk about.

- Everything's good.
- Really?

So you didn't get snarky...

...because I said something nice
to a bowl of chili fries?

All right, maybe I overreacted.

So we're in two different places,
emotionally. So what?

And maybe I'm a little ahead of you,
and that's fine.

In fact, it makes sense,
because let's face it...

...I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

Look, Leonard, you have to know
how much I care about you.

It's just that I've said the L word
too soon before...

...and it didn't work out very well.

Really?
I wouldn't know what that's like.

I'm sorry.

- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, I do.

- So we're good?
- Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

We are good. We are great.

All right. Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

Time to bowl.

Yes, I was eavesdropping.
There's a lot at stake.

Attention, all bowlers...

...I've taken the liberty
of having these made for our rematch.

- The Wesley Crushers?
- No, not the Wesley Crushers.

The Wesley "Crushers."

- I don't get it.
- Wesley Crusher...

<i>...was Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.</i>

Still don't get it.

It's a blindingly clever play on words.

By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S...

...we imply that we will be
the crushers of Wesley.

I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers...

...sounds like people
who like Wesley Crusher.

No, again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

It's the Wesley "Crushers."

No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley...

...it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.

Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not the Wesley Crushers.

It's not the "Wesley" Crushers,
it's Wesley "Crushers."

Hey, look.
They named their team after me.

No, it's not... Never mind.

So we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

Oh, yes.

The losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

FYI, I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper...

...expounding the discredited
Belakovsky hypotheses.

Ouch again.

Hey, Sheldon.

I wanted you to know I'm looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

Oh, yes? Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

- After you.
- No, after you.

As we are currently crushing you,
Wesley.

It's customary for the player
on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

All right.

It's a custom, not a rule.

I so loathe you.

That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.

That's not even from your franchise.

I, um... I want you to know that
even though we're on opposite sides...

...I bear you no ill will.

- Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
- Mm-hm.

People from opposite sides
often have good relationships.

You know, Romeo and Juliet...

<i>...Tony and Maria from West Side Story.</i>

<i>What's-his-name
and the big, blue chick in Avatar.</i>

I'm gonna bowl now.

Be the ball, Howard.

Leave me alone, Sheldon.

You weren't the ball.

Hey, thanks.

- This is fun, huh?
- Yeah.

It's good we got out
and did something physical.

- Mm-hm.
- Gets us out of our heads.

You get in your head...

...you start to over-think, over-analyze,
obsess, you worry.

That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.

- Yeah, that's right.
- Mm-hm.

And someday, we don't know when,
maybe you'll love me back.

Ooh. I'm up.

<i>Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.</i>

Excuse me.

I don't know who you're chanting for,
as I am currently the ball.

<i>The ball. The ball. The ball.</i>

Thank you, Jesus!

As my mother would say.

I'm glad you patched things up
with your boyfriend.

Yeah, me too.

It's tough when the L bomb
gets dropped and you're not ready.

Tell me about it.

I dated this one girl,
and I told her that I loved her...

...and she said she wasn't sure.

And she strung me along
for almost two years. It was brutal.

- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

I wish she had just broken up with me
right there.

Put me out of my misery.

- Really?
- Yeah. Would have been kinder.

- Wil, you're up.
- Oh, that's me.

Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

- What are you talking about?
- He's evil.

He plays evil mind games.

- Did he tell you his grandmother died?
- No.

If he does, don't believe it. He's not above
playing the dead meemaw card.

Yes!

Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton.

<i>But like your time on
Star Trek: Next Generation...</i>

...your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

- Penny, you're up.
- All right, remember...

- ...his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
- Yeah. I got it.

- Oh, we really need a strike here.
- I know.

- Take your time and concentrate.
- Leonard, stop pressuring me.

- I'm not pressuring you.
- You are. Just back off.

Okay. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

I didn't mean shut up.

Fine.

Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

No. This isn't fair to you, Leonard.
I'm sorry.

Wait, where are you going?
Penny, come back.

I'll get you ice cream.

- No, let her go.
- Are you insane?

If she leaves, it's over.

Pretty sure it's already over.

Tough luck, Sheldon.

You did this, didn't you?

Do you think I would break up a couple
just to win a bowling match?

- No, I suppose not.
- Good. Keep thinking that.

Wheaton...

Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yep.

I'm telling you, the Match.com chicks
are much looser than on eHarmony.

Oh. You know, I gotta call you back.
I won a bet and it's time to collect.

I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.

Oh, damn. They cancelled my Visa.

Oh, yay, a new MasterCard.

Uh-oh.

- What?
- I was going to get my mail.

Okay.

Are you hoping to get it telepathically?

I think you mean telekinetically.

And no.

Wasn't sure of the protocol now you
and Leonard are no longer having coitus.

Ugh.

God, can we please just say
"no longer seeing each other"

Well, we could if it were true.

You live in the same building.
You see each other all the time.

The variable which has changed
is the coitus.

Okay, here's the protocol.

You and I are still friends,
and you stop saying coitus.

Good. I'm glad we're still friends.

- Really?
- Oh, yes.

It was a lot of work
to accommodate you in my life.

I'd hate for that effort
to have been in vain.

Right.

Just to be clear, do I have to stop
saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?

Everyone.

Harsh terms, but all right.

- I'll just substitute "intercourse."
- Great.

Or "fornication." Yeah...

But that has judgmental overtones,
so I'll hold that in reserve.

So how you been?

Well, my existence is a continuum...

...so I've been what I am at each point
in the implied time period.

You're just coitusing with me,
aren't you?

- Buzzinga.
- Mm.

- How's Leonard doing?
- He seems all right...

...although he does spend
a disturbing amount of time...

...looking at photographs of you
and smelling the pillow you slept on.

Although now that I think of it,
he asked me not to tell you that.

I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.

I see you bought Mama Italia
marinara spaghetti sauce.

- Yep.
- That's the sauce my mother uses.

She likes cooking Italian...

...because, according to her,
that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.

Interesting. I'll have to have you over
for spaghetti some night.

I'm hungry now.

Oh, um, okay. Why don't you give me
an hour and come over?

Will you cut up hot dogs into little
chunks and mix them in with the sauce?

- I don't have hot dogs.
- It's all right. I do.

Oh. You're in for what my mother calls
a real Italian treat.

- Hey, where you been?
- I was talking with Penny.

What's wrong with you? You can't
hang out with your roommate's ex.

That's totally uncool.

No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.

Yeah. That's why he's been whining...

<i>...about trying to invent that
memory-wiper gizmo from Men In Black.</i>

Is he making any progress?

Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck
as Daredevil.

So would Ben Affleck.

The point is, in a situation like this,
you gotta pick sides.

You're either on team Leonard
or team Penny.

- Which one picks last?
- What?

Usually, I'm on the team
that picks last.

Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.

Sheldon, I got you
your tangerine chicken.

I hope you're hungry.

Well, of course I'm hungry.

And as I have no plans
to eat with any other team...

...I will consume my tangerine chicken
with the appropriate gusto.

Mm, mm, mm.

Okay.

Just out of curiosity,
do we still have hot dogs?

I don't know. Why?

Just making dinner conversation.

Go team Leonard.

- Oh, God, this is good.
- Let me ask you a question.

Do you believe you're going to go to hell
for eating sweet-and-sour pork?

Jews don't have hell.
We have acid reflux.

Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

Certainly. It's not like I have
to moderate my food intake...

...because I'm planning on eating again
very shortly.

Mm, mm, mm.

So you wanna do something tonight?

No, I can't. I gotta pick up my mom
from her water-aerobics class.

Eighteen overweight women
flapping their arm fat...

...in a swimming pool.

It's like the manatee tank
at SeaWorld.

- What about you, Raj?
- Oh, there it is.

Now you don't have a girlfriend
you wanna hang out with me again.

I never stopped hanging out with you.

I'm the friend you call
when you have no other options.

If we were the Justice League,
I'd be Aquaman.

I wish you were Aquaman.

Then I could send you to scoop my mom
out of the old-lady tank.

Excuse me, I'm thirsty...

...so I'm going to go to the refrigerator
and get myself a refreshing beverage.

You know what?
I'll just spend the evening alone.

What? Suddenly, I'm not good enough
for you?

I do so love beverages.

Now I think
I'll take my after-dinner walk.

Since when do you take
after-dinner walks?

Since when do you take walks?

I read a study online that walking
after a meal not only aids in digestion...

...but increases serotonin.

If there's one thing I like more than a
refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye.

- Hold on. I'll walk down with you.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

You can go first.

Or we could go together.

I can't think of a reason why not.

- Let's go.
- Hold on.

Nope. No reason.

I've missed you.

All right,
say hello to your mother for me.

Okay.

What?

You said you were going for a walk.

I didn't say outside.

So what, you're gonna walk
up and down the stairs?

No, of course not.

That would be odd
and suspicious behavior.

- Here, Rumples. Here, boy.
- Which way are you going?

- Which way are you going?
- I parked my scooter down the block.

I'm going the other way. Bye.

Bye.

Oh, actually, I'm this way.

Do I smell hot dogs?

No. I mean,
I have no idea what you smell.

Well, I definitely smell raw hot dog.

Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.

All right, have a nice walk.

I shall. Have a nice scoot.

You might wanna stand back.
I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.

Oh, hello, doggie. Nice doggie.

I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

Look, a cat.

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.

Here.

I had to trade the others for my life.

- Hey, Leonard?
- Yeah?

I haven't had sex in a year.

Where are you going with this, Raj?

Don't flatter yourself, dude.

- I wanna go out and meet a woman.
- So go.

I need a wingman. I don't wanna
come off like a lonely loser.

And you think my presence
will help with that?

Well, I do.
Next to you, I look like a catch.

- I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
- All right.

Would you mind if I went to your room
and downloaded Asian pornography?

Very much.

Doesn't have to be Asian.

- Don't worry. You'll meet a girl.
- No, I won't.

Yes, you will.
And she'll be beautiful...

...and kind and sexy and funny and
everything you ever wanted in a woman.

- You really think so?
- I do.

You'll fall hopelessly in love
and give her your heart.

She'll take it and grind it
into pathetic little pieces.

We will have sex first, right?

Mm, mm, mm.

That's Italian.

So was Leonard okay
with you coming over?

Oh. Yes.

In fact, he said, "I'm fine. I don't care."

In no manner
which would lead one to believe...

...that he was covering up feelings
of anguish and betrayal.

- Well, good.
- I'm also pleased to report...

...that he's all cried out over you.

He's been crying?

Oh, I believe that was something else
I wasn't supposed to mention.

Oh, God. I feel terrible.

Do you have a stomachache too?

No. Why, do you?

No.

Why did you ask if I had one too?

Just making polite
dinner conversation.

Your turn.

All right.

So, what's new in your life?

Well, my new shoes
are not made for running.

Have you been running?

No.

It's just a suspicion I have.

Mm, mm, mm.

- I'm so glad you like it.
- I do.

Leonard never cooks for me.

Well, maybe that's because
Leonard can't cook.

You can't cook and you made me this.

Whatever. Oh, let me get the cheesecake
out of the fridge.

Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

Look at this. Do you think she's
really doing that or is it Photoshop?

I'm sure
Martha Stewart never got naked...

...with a room full
of big fat Japanese guys.

You don't know that.

Prison changes people.

Hey, where you been?

I told you. Walking.

For an hour and a half?

I got lost.

How could you get lost?
Your phone has GPS.

Satellites are down. Solar flares.

- There are no solar flares now.
- Yes, there are.

Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there
were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.

I'm sorry, I misspoke.

What I meant to say
was my battery died.

- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton
doing it with Oprah?

Aw, we really need to get you a girl.

Leonard.

Leonard.

- Leonard.
- Oh, just come in!

Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

What do you want, Sheldon?

Maybe this isn't a good time.

Tell me why you woke me up
or I swear to God I will kill you.

Do you really think death threats are an
appropriate way to begin conversation?

Sometimes your lack of social skills
astonishes me.

What do you want?

You may wanna sit down.

I'm in bed.

Point taken. You may wanna sit up.

Sheldon!

I've been seeing Penny
behind your back.

Okay.

When you say "seeing Penny,"
what exactly does that mean?

We had dinner last night.

She made me spaghetti
with little hot dogs cut up in it.

Well, little hot dog.

I gave up the other five hot dogs
to a real dog.

A real big dog.

A hell hound.

It's tangential to the primary story.
How about I circle back to it?

Fine. Why did you
have dinner with Penny?

She made spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

Well, then why did you
have Chinese food with us?

I didn't wanna upset you.

Howard made it very clear that my
allegiance should be to male comrades...

...before women who sell their bodies
for money.

Is it possible he said,
"Bros before ho's"?

Yes, but I rephrased it
to avoid offending the ho's.

Sheldon, I don't care
if you wanna be friends with Penny.

Oh.

So the turmoil
that has been keeping me...

...from achieving REM sleep
was entirely unjustified?

Yes.

Well, then as my meemaw would say...

...looks like we butchered a pig,
but nobody wanted bacon.

I guess not.

And now, as promised, the tangent.

<i>Sheldon and the Hell Hound.</i>

<i>Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</i>

Oh, um, ahem.

- I can come back.
- Don't be silly.

We're neighbors. We're gonna run into
each other. May as well get used to it.

Yeah. I guess you're right.

- Used to it yet?
- Nope.

Me neither.

Oh. Sheldon seemed to think
I'd be upset about you hanging out.

But I want you to know it's fine.

Oh, good.
Because his mother called me.

- His mother?
- Yeah, she wants me...

...to take him shopping
for sheets and towels.

I was gonna do that.

Oh, well, then you do it.

I don't wanna do it. You can do it.

Okay, then you can take him
for shoes.

I just took him for shoes.

Well, all I know is he says
they hurt his feet.

Fine. I'll take him for shoes
next Saturday.

No. A bunch of us from work
are going to Disneyland next Saturday...

...and Sheldon wants to come.

You're taking him to Disneyland?

Well, he heard me making plans
on the phone. Was I gonna say no?

All right, but let me know if you're
gonna stuff him with junk food.

I don't wanna bring home a nice dinner
for him and see it go to waste.

We're going to Disneyland.
He's gonna eat junk food.

All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.

Okay, whatever.

And don't let him go on Space Mountain
after he eats.

He'll say he can handle it, but you'll
end up with churro puke on your shoes.

All right. Got it. Anything else?

Don't let Goofy near him.

He'll have nightmares,
and I'll have to deal with it.

- What's the problem with Goofy?
- Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

<i>Do you think the elastic woman
in The Incredibles...</i>

...needs to use birth control
or can she just be a diaphragm?

Well, that's it. We're officially
out of things to talk about.

We're home.

It's 10:00. Where have you been?

We stayed
for the California Adventure water show.

It was pure Disney magic.

- I was gonna see that with him.
- How was I to know that?

It's all right. I'll see it again with you.

I have food here. You were gonna call.

- I know, I know.
- I can still eat.

No. You already threw up once.
Go put on your p.j.'s and brush your teeth.

Okay, but just don't fight.

- We're not fighting.
- Just go.

Aren't you gonna thank Penny
for taking you?

Thank you, Penny.

You're welcome, sweetie.

Want a cup of coffee?

Oh, I should probably get going.

- Come on, it's just a cup of coffee.
- Yeah. Okay.

Yeah, the whole thing
seems a little twisted to me too.

What am I smelling?

Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

Such an angel when he's asleep.

Yeah, shame he has to wake up.

I think we can do it.

Smother Sheldon in his sleep?
Wouldn't that be wrong?

No, be friends. You and me.

Oh, sure.

Absolutely.

Good. I'm glad.

Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it
out there. Friends who have sex.

Good night, Leonard.

Kidding. Just a couple of friends
goofing around.

No, Goofy, no.

- Hold.
- What?

Explain your sneeze.

- I'm sorry?
- Do you have allergies?

- No.
- Too much pepper on your salad?

- I don't put pepper on salads.
- I've heard enough. Sit over there.

Come on, I don't wanna sit by myself.

That's what Typhoid Mary said.
Clearly, her friends buckled.

Guys, help me.

- Sheldon, come on.
- Yeah, it's just one sneeze.

- You're on your own.
- See you, buddy.

Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.

Per our roommate agreement,
this is your 24-hour notice...

...that I will be having
a non-related female...

...spending two nights
in our apartment.

When you say non-related female,
you still mean human, right?

Well, of course.

Pets are banned by the agreement,
with the exception of service animals...

...such as Seeing Eye dogs
and, one day...

...cybernetically enhanced
helper monkeys.

Are you planning
on kidnapping a woman?

- Sarcasm?
- Yes.

But mixed with genuine concern.

For your information...

...I'll be playing host
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

- Cosmological physicist from Princeton?
- Yes.

And until you acquire
a surgical mask...

...please address your comments to me
through a napkin.

We've been corresponding for years
about our mutual interest...

...in gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe.

Now she's under consideration
for a position at our university.

Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

I am a huge fan of hers.

I didn't realize I had to share
my connection...

...with things you're a fan of,
but, very well.

You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.

- Okay, fine. Where is she gonna sleep?
- My room, of course.

Holy crap.

Holy crap.

- Yeah, I have a two-part question.
- Go ahead.

A, are you kidding me?

And B, seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

A, I rarely kid.

And B, when I do kid, you will know it
by my use of the word "buzzinga."

So you're saying the two of you are
going to be sleeping in the same bed?

Yes.

Buzzinga.

Leonard?

Thank you.

Why is a renowned scientist staying
in our apartment instead of a hotel?

She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?

Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens...

...keys shaped like credit cards.

As if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet.

All right, I believe I have time
for one more question.

Yes, Raj?

When can I sit with you again?

When I've seen two negative
throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.

You know the drill.

All right, if you'll excuse me...

...I am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics.

I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

I can't believe
they let him into Canada.

Whoa. You heard the man.
Where's your throat cultures?

- Kidding. Sit down.
- Ha.

- Hey, Sheldon.
- Oh, Penny, excellent.

I have a question
about these maxi pads.

Are the wings truly functional
or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?

What? What are you
doing with...? What?

The stock boy at Walgreens was
frustratingly uninformed on the subject.

Sheldon, what are you doing
with maxi pads?

I have a lady friend who will
be staying with me for a few days.

Oh.

What?

I want her to feel at home.

I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews...

...and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed...

...to regulate the female bowel.

Wait. Wait, hold on. Back up.

You're having a woman stay with you?

Yes. Why does that seem
to flabbergast everybody?

No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.

I'm puzzled.

Yeah, let's go with puzzled.

A word of warning:

My guest is a noted physicist...

...and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology...

...so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female gibber-gabber.

Female gibber-gabber?

Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks...

...gossip about your friends,
Brad and Angelina.

No, they're not my friends.

Not surprised, considering how
you talk about them behind their backs.

She's here. She's here.
How do I look? Do I look smart?

Oh, good grief. This isn't about you.

Coming.

Now, listen, one of the great minds
of the 21st century...

...is about to play host to one of the
other great minds of the 21st century.

So pay attention.

Years from now, my biographer
might ask you about this event.

Well, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

I completely forgot your address.

But then, I remembered
that I'd written it on my hand.

Lucky I didn't confuse it with
what I'd written on my other hand...

...which are the coordinates
for a neutron star.

Because if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hyper gravity.

- Anyway, hello.
- Hello.

- Nice to finally meet you in person.
- I would imagine it is.

This is my friend and roommate,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

Hi-lo.

Oops. I started to say hi, and then
I switched to hello in the middle.

It came out "hi-lo."

Duh.

It's nice to meet you.

I've read both your books
and your papers.

I'm Leonard.
I live here. You're brilliant.

I apologize.
He's only an experimental physicist.

No need to apologize. Some of my
best friends are experimental physicists.

Well, not my best friends.
But I know them.

My best friend
is a molecular chemist named Wendy.

I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

- Hi-lo.
- Heh, heh.

Hungry? Can I offer you anything?

If anyone should offer her anything,
it should be me.

Elizabeth, can I get you something?

Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

Interesting choices.

Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

Excellent.

If the yogurt works, I bought
some delightful scented candles.

Look, it's you.

Thank you so much
for opening up your home to me.

Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

I'm so glad you understand.

No, he doesn't understand.

- I understand.
- I understand too.

You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

I think any university would want you.

Except any university
that already had you...

...because they would've
already wanted you...

...before they, you know, got you.

From the mind that brought you hi-lo.

Let me show you to your room.

All right, I guess I am tired.

- Good night, Leonard.
- Sleep night.

I mean, obviously, good night.

I started to say sleep tight.
Then I changed my mind in the middle.

I swear to God, I'm smart.

Get it together, man.

All right, let me show you
some of the features of the room.

First, windows. Conventional.

Open, closed. Open, closed.

Halfway open, or halfway closed...

...depending on
your philosophical bent.

Over here is my comic-book collection.
Feel free to browse.

There's a box of disposable
reading gloves on the nightstand.

Good to know.

In here,
you'll find emergency provisions.

An eight-day supply
of food and water, a crossbow...

<i>...season two of
Star Trek: The Original Series...</i>

...on a high-density flash drive.

What if there's a disaster
that destroys all the USB ports?

Then there's really
no reason to live, is there?

Can I ask you a question
about your roommate?

He's an odd duck, isn't he?

What's his relationship status?

Well, there was
a misbegotten adventure...

...with a waitress
who lives across the hall.

It ended as inexplicably as it began.

They had very little in common
except for carnal activity.

That's why I acquired
these noise-canceling headphones.

If you decide to use them,
please clean the earpieces afterwards...

...with the Wet Wipes
you'll find in the bathroom.

They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

- Okay.
- Good.

I'll leave you
to your nighttime ablutions.

I've e-mailed you
the morning bathroom schedule.

You'll also find a laminated copy
in your welcome packet.

On the back of
the emergency-escape-route diagram.

How thoughtful.

- Sleep well, my friend.
- You too.

Let me just get one thing.

It's my backup emergency supply kit.

The living-room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

Now, good night.

And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

Yes?

- I saw your light on.
- Is everything all right?

Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

Me neither.

Look what I'm reading.

It's you.

- I thought you already read it.
- I did.

But it's been a while, and I wanted
to sound smart over breakfast.

Aw, you're smart.

Oh, good. I wasn't sure
it was coming across.

What chapter are you on?

Uh, six.

Ah. The extragalactic distance ladder.

- Want to know a little secret?
- Sure.

I wrote the section on the
Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.

Really?

Sure doesn't read that way.

Here, let me show you.

When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars...

...we start to see
a possible explanation...

...for some of the discrepancies
found in Hubble's constant.

Wow.

You really make science come alive.

Vocal test.

Morning vocal test.

Second vocal test.
Second morning vocal test.

- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.

- Morning, Sheldon.
- Morning.

- I trust you had a pleasant night?
- More than pleasant.

Excuse me.
I'm going to relieve myself.

- How do you take your coffee?
- Black.

Okeydoke.

Pee for Houston. Pee for Austin.

Pee for the state my heart got lost in.

And shake twice for Texas.

Something his mother taught him.

All right.
Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.

The seat is down and has been
sanitized for your protection.

That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

I'll fire off a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

Oh, good, you're up.
My car won't start.

I need a ride to work.

Did you ignore
your check-engine light?

No, Mr. Smarty-pants.

I ignored the fill-gas-tank light.

Leonard, Penny wants to exploit
any feelings you have for her...

...in order to get a ride to work.

Oh, uh, sure, let me just put this
in a travel mug.

- Hello?
- Hi.

Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton,
a leading expert on quantum cosmology.

Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand...

...the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine.

- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

- Are you enjoying your stay?
- Yes, very much.

Good.

Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time
is coming up...

...and, believe me,
you do not want to follow him.

Excuse me.

Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed
so I can take everyone to work.

You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend,
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.

It'll be fun.

Like a clown car. Heh, heh.

- Hang on.
- Hm, yeah? What? Huh?

We just broke up.

You and me? Yeah, we did.

Not too long ago.
How are you doing with it?

Not as good as you, apparently.

I don't follow.

You know, it's none of my business.

You wanna sleep with Sheldon's buddy
right after we broke up, go for it.

- Well, now...
- Excuse me.

I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending...

...Leonard pursue intercourse
with Dr. Plimpton.

Who, I assure you,
has better things to do.

I'm not recommending it.

I'm saying it already happened.

Oh, that's preposterous.

Tell her, Leonard.

Well...

No.

Oh, come on. It wasn't my fault.

The implication being that you somehow
tripped and fell into her lady parts?

I'm just gonna take the bus to work.

- Penny, I can still drive you.
- No, no, it's okay.

You might slip on a banana peel
and get me pregnant.

I must say,
I'm shocked by this betrayal.

I didn't betray Penny.

Not Penny, me.

How am I betraying you?

Elizabeth's my friend,
and you're playing with her.

Yeah, I guess I did.

What the hell are you doing?

Relax, it's Nyquil.

- You still have a cold?
- Maybe, but I don't care.

That's the great thing about Nyquil,
it's like 10 percent booze.

I call it the nighttime
sniffling, sneezing, coughing...

...so-you-can-talk-to-girls medicine.

Are you having trouble sleeping?

Because, boy, I was up all night.

Did you get a cold too?

No, I was awake all night.

If you want, I can give you
some of my mom's sleeping pills.

- She won't notice they're missing?
- She doesn't know she takes them.

No, that's okay. It was something else
keeping me up last night.

And again this morning.

And I didn't mind.

I was up last night.
I was up this morning. I didn't mind.

Those are your clues.

Ooh, ooh, did the pigeon
on your window sill have more babies?

- No.
- Were you making another Lego movie?

- No.
- Because let me tell you:

It's not enough to make the Legos move.
They also have to capture your heart.

Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

It involved another person.

Did you get a Japanese love pillow?

How is a Japanese love pillow
another person?

It is if you love her
and give her a name.

Dr. Plimpton,
I'd like you to meet my colleagues.

Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

- And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
- Hi.

- I'm a big fan of your work.
- Thank you.

And, of course, you've already
introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.

- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

You know what? I am a little tired.

Would you be a dear
and get me a cup of coffee?

Sure. Black, right?

Actually, now I think I want it
hot, brown and sweet.

Coming right up.

What?

What do you mean, "what?"
It's "Halo" night.

I can't. I'm too sick.

Go away.

That's why we moved
"Halo" night here.

I brought my mom's chicken soup.

I'm not hungry.

Don't send him away. Let him in.

- Who is that?
- I bought a parrot.

Yeah, right.

- Dr. Plimpton?
- Hi.

- Howard, right?
- Uh, yeah.

Can I ask you a question, Howard?

Do you like role-playing games?

Yeah, sure. Heh.

In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

Not tonight.

Tonight, you are a deliveryman.

You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I
don't have enough money to pay you.

So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement.

Beg pardon?

You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something...

...I don't mind getting ripped off
my milky flesh.

What the frak?

Go away.

She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.

Besides, you have a girlfriend.

We broke up weeks ago.

- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was waiting for the right time.

This is the right time.

Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?

Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost.

The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

I don't understand.

Oh, good. Leonard's here.

Good?

Elizabeth? What's going on?

What's going on is you and Howard
are my moving men.

And Raj is my new landlord.

And I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.

Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?

<i>Yup. Welcome to
the Renthouse Forum.</i>

Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

We'll all be naked
in front of each other.

I'm out.

Everybody ready?

Follow my lead. Almost.

We're going to go out into the hallway
and make a dramatic entrance.

Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.

Run, run, run. Don't look back.

I thought we had something special.

So you say you can't pay your rent?

- Oh, Leonard?
- Hey.

I found these in the dryer.

I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.

Thanks. It's really hard
to find these in his size.

So listen.

I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.

You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

Yeah, I wanted to explain.

No. You don't owe me an explanation.

- I don't?
- No, you don't.

So you're not judging me?

Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday...

...but you don't owe me
an explanation.

Nevertheless, I'd like to get one
on the record...

...so you can understand
why I did what I did.

I'm listening.

She let me.

Okay, Baby-Doll Pink...

...let's see if you can cover up the fact
that I got my dad's feet.

It's two degrees, Sheldon.

I just wanna turn up
the thermostat two degrees.

Let me point out
that two degrees can be the difference...

...between water and steam.

Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

This is the temperature you
agreed to in the roommate agreement.

Screw the roommate agreement.

No, you don't screw
the roommate agreement...

...the roommate agreement screws you.

You know what,
go to hell and set their thermostat.

I don't have to go to hell.
At 73 degrees, I'm there already.

Who is it?

- Leonard.
- Hang on.

Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

You can try, but the people
across the hall are being very noisy.

You heard that, huh?

Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

...then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

So you agree he's nuts.

Not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

Oh, I do not believe that.

You are so naive.

Just like I was seven years ago.

<i>I'd just started at the university.</i>

Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

- Oh. I bet you're here to check out the room.
- Yeah.

Run away, dude.

- What?
- Run fast, run far.

That should've been my first clue.

So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

He had this really deranged look.

Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.

Sure, it makes sense now.

<i>Anyway, I went upstairs
and knocked on the door.</i>

Yeah?

Dr. Cooper?

No, you want the crazy guy
across the hall.

<i>In retrospect, that was clue number two.</i>

- Yes?
- I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

- I called about the apartment. You said...
- I know what I said. I know what you said.

I know what my mother said
on March 5th, 1992.

What is the sixth noble gas?

- What?
- You said you're a scientist.

- What is the sixth noble gas?
- Uh, Radon?

Are you asking me or telling me?

Telling you?

Telling you.

All right. Next question.

Kirk or Picard?

Oh, uh... Well, that's tricky. Um...

<i>Well, original series over
Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.</i>

Correct.

You've passed the first barrier
to roommate hood.

You may enter.

Oh, this is pretty nice.

- The bedrooms are back there?
- That depends.

I don't understand.
Their existence is conditional?

No. But your ability to
perceive their existence is conditional...

...on you passing
the second and third barriers.

- There's three?
- Each more daunting than the last.

- Have a seat.
- Okay.

No, that's where I sit.

What's the difference?

This seat is ideally located...

...in relation to the heat source in the
winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

It also faces the television
at a direct angle...

...allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play...

...without being subjected to conversation.
As a result...

...I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.

Can you do that?

That's Latin for "My chair my rules."

Now, you said on the phone
that your area of study is physics.

Yeah, experimental physics.

Hmm.

- What is that?
- Doesn't concern you.

You'll be going to the university
every day?

- Yes.
- Do you have a vehicle?

- A car.
- And you'd be willing to drive me?

- Well, can't you drive?
- I can.

I choose not to.

Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

- Well, what's a point in my favor, right?
- Why don't you let me do this?

Come on, I just asked.

Last question.
In a post-apocalyptic world...

...which task would you assign
the highest priority?

Locating a sustainable food source,
reestablishing a functioning government...

...procreation
or preserving the knowledge of mankind?

Uh, I'm gonna go with
preserving the knowledge.

That's correct.

FYI, I would've accepted
any answer other than procreating.

Come, I'll show you
the rest of the apartment.

Good. I passed the barriers.

The second barrier. Don't get cocky.

This is the bathroom.

Are you fairly regular?

- Uh... I guess.
- This isn't going to work if you're guessing.

When do you evacuate your bowels?

When I have to.

When you have to?
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

I'm sorry, in the morning. Around 8.

I can't give you 8. I can give you 7:30.

Fine, I'll take it.

Third barrier passed.

You have won the right to see your room.

Pizah.

- Is this it?
- No, this is my room.

People don't go in my room.

So where do you sleep? Heh.

I don't understand.

If people don't go in there,
and you're people and...

You are people, aren't you?

Making a joke.

Do you do this often?

On occasion.

Your room.

You may wanna repaint.

And after all that you just moved in?

I didn't just move in.
First we had to iron out a few details.

"Roommates agree
that Friday nights shall be reserved...

<i>...for watching Joss Whedon's
brilliant new series, Firefly."</i>

Does that really need to be
in the agreement?

Might as well settle it now,
it's gonna be on for years.

Initial here.

All right, that's television and movies.

"Section nine: Miscellany.

The apartment's flag is a gold lion
rampant on a field of azure."

We have a flag?

Never fly it upside down.

Unless the apartment's in distress.

Fine, next.

"If either of us ever invents time travel...

...we agree our first stop will be this
meeting today in precisely five seconds."

Okay.

Well, that's disappointing.

Why on earth did you agree to all that?

It was the best apartment I'd seen,
the rent was very reasonable...

...and after you pass the first three barriers,
you kind of wanna take it all the way.

Well, I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

Okay. Let me tell you about the first time
I brought a girl over.

Leonard?

Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

Leonard?

I'm sure he'll go away.

I'm just gonna keep knocking
till you answer.

Leonard?

Leonard? Leonard?

What do you want?

I didn't say come in.

You asked what I want.

I wanted to come in.

I'm here because you violated
our roommate agreement.

Specifically, section eight...

...visitor's subsection C, females,
paragraph four, coitus.

"Roommates shall give each other
12 hours notice of impending coitus."

I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.

That's it, I'm out of here.

Joyce, come on.

Twelve hours?

Oh, my God.

- Do I get some sympathy now?
- Little bit.

Let me get this straight.

You move in with this guy, makes
you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement.

Then he walks into your bedroom
while you're doing Joyce Kim...

...and you still stay?

Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him
about Joyce Kim.

Why not?

Well, I was doing some
government research at the time.

You know, military rocket fuels.
Kind of secret.

- What does that have to do with Joyce?
- As it turns out...

...she was a North Korean spy.

Luckily, Sheldon drove her out
before I revealed anything important.

Which I'm not saying I would have.

So you stayed with Sheldon
all this time...

...because he kept you from going
to federal prison?

That's part of it. The other part is
what happened with the elevator.

I've been wondering. You said
it was working when you moved in.

It was. But one night
Sheldon came home from work...

What is going on here?

Hey, this is Howard and Raj.
They work at the university too.

- Hey.
- Hey.

I'll get to you later.

What are you sitting on?

I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushy. Heh, heh.

- It's a joke.
- Not a good idea.

- "Tushy" is "buttocks," right?
- Right.

Heh. Hilarious. Heh, heh.

Explain the couch.

There were people on the first floor
who were moving out and sold it for $100.

- Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
- What's wrong with the furniture we have?

They are lawn chairs.

There was no place for company.

Did it occur to you that was by design?

According to the roommate agreement,
I'm entitled to allocate 50 percent...

...of the cubic footage
of common areas.

But you didn't notify me by e-mail,
so this is still a breach.

I did notify you.

Oh, you did, did you?

Drat.

Hoisted by my own spam filter.

- What am I doing in your spam?
- I put you there after you forwarded me...

...a picture of a cat playing
the piano entitled "T his is funny."

Oh, yeah. I saw that. That was hilarious.
Heh-heh-heh.

- What's this have to do with the elevator?
- I'm getting to it.

I assure you, you'll be sorry
you wasted your money on an iPod...

...when Microsoft comes out with theirs.

Okay, do you have an opinion
about everything?

Yes.

You just assume you're always right?

It's not an assumption.

- Change seats with me.
- Why?

I don't like this spot.
I have to keep turning my head.

Fine.

<i>It's time for Babylon 5.</i>

<i>We don't watch Babylon 5
in this apartment.</i>

<i>- Why not?
- Because no one likes Babylon 5.</i>

- I like it.
- Me too.

- So do I.
- There you go, three against one.

They don't get a vote. It's one against one.

And according to the roommate agreement,
all ties will be settled by me.

- But I said no to that.
- And I said yes.

And I settle all ties.

- Change seats with me.
- Why?

There's a draft on my neck over here.

So I get the draft?

You're protected by your turtleneck.

Fine.

And it's a dickey.

Hmm...

I'm still not comfortable.

Of course,
there's too many people here.

We can fix that. Let's leave.

Yeah, we can go over to my place.

Wait, let me get my jacket.

- You're not going with us.
- Why not?

You're the guy
we're trying to get away from.

Oh.

In that case, I don't need my jacket.

And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

"I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away."

Oh, yes.

This is definitely gonna be my spot.

Okay. How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man-feet or not?

Fine. Go ahead.

Howard, are you having a playdate?!

I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!

Do their parents know they're here?!

No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

That your dad?

She grows any more hair on her face, yes.

Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?

Three. I designed the engine myself.

Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel...

...the government's been working on.

Oh, this just might be your lucky day.

Howard, what happened to
the Oreos I left on the counter?!

I haven't seen your Oreos!

Just take your bath without them!

So why was it his lucky day?

It turns out I had a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

Joyce Kim was curious
about what I did for a living...

...and I was gonna
kind of show it to her.

The point is, the guys and I
went back to the apartment.

- Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
- We're close. We're at the apartment.

The trick is to mix it into Tovex in
order to create a combustible gel...

...that will generate over
8000 kilonewtons of thrust.

- Cool.
- Nice.

Won't work.

Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

Trust me, it'll work.

You don't see your mistake, do you?

There's no mistake.

This is for a full scale rocket,
not a model.

- Well, I've adjusted the formula.
- Not correctly.

Okay, I've had it with you.

You might be an expert on theoretical
physics and science fiction programs...

...and where to sit on a freaking couch,
but this is applied physics.

And when it comes to applied physics...
Uh-oh.

- What's happening?
- A bad thing. A very bad thing.

Get the door.

Get the door. Get the door. Get the door.

- You're waiting for the elevator?
- Oh, right.

- Wait. It's here.
- Ah!

Give me that.

What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time.

You're welcome.

Not only did Sheldon save my life,
he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

Or the police. Or Homeland Security.

So you're the reason...

...I have to walk up and down
three flights of stairs every day?

So I did something stupid.
I'm sure you did stupid things.

What were you doing seven years ago?

Excuse me, I was in high school.
Studying, keeping my nose clean...

...doing volunteer work
for the community.

Not pregnant. Yes!

Ha, ha!

Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

- Hey.
- Hello.

Why do I smell methacrylate?

Oh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi.

Men can get those.

Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

There's doubt?

I did agree to the thermostat setting
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

That's not an apology.

That's simply an acknowledgment
that I was right.

- Okay, I'm sorry.
- There you go.

So we're good?

- Good what?
- Never mind.

- Okay if I watch some TV?
- Go ahead.

<i>Up next: Babylon 5.</i>

- You're not even watching.
- I can hear it.

Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

I would hardly call that dialogue.

You are insane, you know that?

Don't make me turn that flag
upside down because you know I'll do it.

Okay, we've got power to the laser.

I should've brought an umbrella.

- What for? It's not gonna rain.
- I know.

But with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility.

That's a buzzinga, right?

One of my best, don't you think?

Howard, double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser.

- We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
- You got it.

Raj, no.

Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet...

...and filling it with pictures of naked women
so we don't have to peep through windows.

It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.

<i>The Good Wife is on.</i>

<i>I tell you,
this is my new Grey's Anatomy.</i>

Leonard, what is that? What is that?

Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

How on earth can you say "dirty sock"
and "relax" in the same sentence?

Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty, discarded socks.

Not my world.

You know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

I wasn't aware that lunar ranging
was her thing.

Although I suppose...

...the retro reflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong...

...does qualify as a shiny object.

Ask her to come up.

I don't know. It's still weird since,
you know...

- She dumped you?
- She didn't dump me.

We were just in different places
in the relationship.

I fail to see how a relationship...

...can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

Well, it's very simple. Leonard was living
in a town called Please Don't Leave Me...

...while Penny had just moved
to the island of Bye-bye.

Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.

Something's very wrong.

Oh, hi. What's going on?

We're up on the roof
bouncing laser beams off the moon.

I'm sorry, what?

It's cool. We've got a two-meter
parabolic reflector and everything.

- I thought you might wanna see it.
- That makes no sense.

How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

Oh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.

- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

- Maybe another time.
- Yeah. Maybe.

- Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
- Oh, what about the party?

It's a surprise party,
doesn't matter when we get there.

Right.

Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

So how'd you guys meet?

My company designs the menus
for The Cheesecake Factory.

Your company?

My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.

So menus.

It sounds easy, but there's a lot of science
that goes into designing them.

Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

Thank you.

Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

- Hey, guys. This is my friend Zack.
- Hey.

- Hello.
- Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

Yes. In 1917...

...when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

<i>...in his paper
Zur Quantentheorle der Strahlung...</i>

...his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen."

Well, mission accomplished.

Let me explain what we're doing here.

<i>In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11...</i>

...positioned reflectors on the moon.

We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

...and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

Oh, that's very cool.

One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

- The laser?
- The moon.

See, now this is a man for Penny.

- That's a great question, Zack.
- No, it's not.

- Sheldon, play nice.
- It's not a great question.

How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

That's a great question.

Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

Smart.

We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't
be strong enough when it comes back...

- ...to be seen by the naked eye.
- Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

Right, funny.

So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

...and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.

Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

Make it so.

There it is. There's the spike.

Two-point-five seconds for the light to
return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

...that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

...put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

...had just invented the airplane.

What species is that?

I was wrong. Penny can do better.

- Okay, guys, thank you. It's been fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

- Should we invite them to the party?
- No, just keep walking.

He's must be very skilled at coitus.

I'm telling you, dude...

...the only way to feel better
about Penny going out with other guys...

...is for you to get back on the whores.

- Horse.
- What?

The phrase is "get back on the horse."
Not whores.

That's disgusting, dude.

No, it's not... Never mind.

He is right, though.

If you want, I can turn you on
to this great new dating site I found.

No, thanks.

You sure? They say
they can find a match for anybody.

- Have they found a match for you?
- Tons.

I've had, like, eight dates
in the last month.

Twelve, if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

- I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
- Why not?

All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.

- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

Lift with your knees, not your back.

Good night.

You know what would be fun?

- Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
- Yeah, right.

No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.

Like when Frankenstein's monster
was lonely and he found a wife.

He didn't find a wife.

They built him a wife
out of dead body parts.

Okay, we'll call that plan B.

Coming.

Damn you, you rat bastard.

Are you drunk?

Zack was a perfectly nice guy
and then you ruined him.

How did I ruin him?

Because in the olden days,
I never would've known he was so stupid.

- Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
- Yes, he was.

He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon.

Okay, yeah, he's stupid. Heh, heh.

He spent the entire night...

...bragging about how he invented
the word "appeteasers."

How is that my fault?

You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

Now, come with me.

- Where are we going?
- We're gonna have sex.

Why? I mean, okay.

What's going on?

Put on your noise-canceling headphones,
because it's gonna get loud.

Ugh. Not this again.

In what universe is this "low-pulp"?

Good morning, Penny.

Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

When one gets beaten up
every other day in school...

...one, of necessity,
develops a keen sense of hearing.

Incidentally, one can get beaten up
in school...

...simply
by referring to oneself as "one."

I'm making English muffins.
Would you like an English muffin?

Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.

FYI, my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

- Yeah, sorry about that.
- As a native Texan, I must say...

...I've never heard the phrase "yeehaw"
used in quite that context.

Oh, God.

"Oh, God."

That I've heard on multiple occasions.

In what universe is that "lightly toasted"?

This has to be the worst day of my life.

Good morning, Leonard.

How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

Counting this instance?
Three hundred seventeen.

- Where's Penny?
- She returned to her apartment.

I presume to shower and vomit.

Not necessarily in that order.

Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.

Are you expecting me to offer
an explanation of human behavior?

I know. I thought as an outsider...

...you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

Well, I have no difficulty
believing you are not butter.

- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

- I gotta run. Early shift.
- Okay, I'll walk down with you.

So last night was fun, huh?

Yeah, it must've been.
I just threw up in my closet.

Bummer.

I was thinking tonight
maybe we could catch a movie.

Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

Doesn't have to be tonight.
I'm free pretty much always.

Leonard, last night was a mistake.

When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake...

...like the discovery of penicillin?

Look, I'm sorry.

I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

Can we just forget it ever happened?

No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

Especially the whole rodeo thing.

Oh, God.

So that's it?
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?

How am I supposed to let it go?
You used me for sex.

Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

Good morning, Leonard.
Or should I say "yeehaw"

- Holy crap.
- What?

We finally have proof...

- ...that aliens walk among us.
- Excuse me?

The dating site
matched a woman with Sheldon.

You're kidding. An actual woman?

Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

Trust me, breasts doesn't
necessarily mean "woman."

- Since when?
- I'll show you a picture...

...of my Uncle Louie
in a bathing suit sometime.

Leonard, you gotta see this.
We found a match for Sheldon.

Great. Maybe she can have sex with him
and walk out on him the next morning...

...without so much
as a "How do you do?"

- Know what he's talking about?
- No. Ask him.

- Leonard, what?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

That was a lousy suggestion.

Whatever.

Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper
has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.

"Greetings, fellow life-form..."

If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

If she can do it, I can do it.

I can't do it.

- Hello?
- Oh, hi. Hey.

Hi, Leslie.

Leonard, what're you doing here?

I know. It's been a while.

Yeah, 18 months.

Right. Right.

So how you doing?

- Fine. You?
- Not bad.

You remember
when we used to have sex...

...and you said it didn't mean anything,
it was just for fun?

Yeah.

Do you wanna do that again?

What happened? Blondie dumped you?

She didn't dump me. We were
just in different places in the relationship.

Right.

Anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back
to people you're no longer seeing...

- ...and have recreational sex with them.
- Uh-huh.

So, what do you say?

Let me think about it.

She's not coming back.

- Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
- Not us. Him.

Yes, but "him"
doesn't even know about "her."

Well, "him" about to find out about "her."

Really? Us gonna tell him?

Who's going to tell whom about what?

Sheldon. Hey. Hi.

Your surprise confuses me. I live here.

Right.

So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

- Be more specific.
- Four-thirty.

That's not afternoon. That's preevning.

- What?
- It's a time of day I invented.

It better defines the ambiguous period...

...between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

Fairly certain it will catch on
as it fills a desperate need.

Right, okay. What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
Saturday night is laundry night.

So I'll be spending the preevning
pre-sorting and pre-soaking.

Okay, what if I were to tell you...

...tomorrow at 4:30,
you could meet a woman...

...who has been scientifically chosen
to be your perfect mate?

I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air...

...exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

But it's true.

We put all your vital information
into this dating site...

...answered all questions like you would
and they found a match for you.

- Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
- Please.

Even assuming you could answer
any question the way I would...

...the algorithms used
by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

That's the answer
we gave to the question.

"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

Well, Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

Our Sheldon would say "hokum."

Come on,
where's your scientific curiosity?

Most of it is being applied to unraveling
secrets of universe...

...while the rest of it is wondering why
I'm having this conversation with you.

Okay, how about this?

Even Spock had a date
once every seven years,

He didn't date. It was pon farr.

His blood boiled with mating lust.

Why don't you start
with a cup of coffee...

...and you can pon farr
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

- I don't drink coffee.
- All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,
my choice of beverage is moot.

For the record,
I only drink hot chocolate...

...in months with an R in them.

- Why?
- What's life without whimsy?

Okay, I'm out.

Sheldon...

...I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof
somewhere in your apartment.

Unless you're willing
to come with us to meet this girl...

...it will remain there forever.

You're bluffing.

Are you willing to risk it?

Curse you.

Thirty feet.

Oh. Hey, Leonard.

I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy...

...and then you ruined me.

Are you drunk?

Come on. We're gonna have sex
and it's not gonna mean a thing.

Are you out of your mind?

I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

In a few minutes, when I gloat
over the failure of this enterprise...

...how would you prefer I do it?
The standard "I told you so"?

With a classic "neener-neener"?

Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

- You don't know we're wrong yet.
- Haughty derision it is.

Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in...

...by unsupportable mathematics...

...designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

Additionally, I'm being blackmailed
with a hidden dirty sock.

If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

If it was literal,
I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

I'm here because my mother and I have
agreed that I will date at least once a year.

Interesting.

My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

I don't object to the concept of a deity,
but I'm baffled by the notion...

...of one that takes attendance.

Well, then you might
want to avoid East Texas.

Noted. Now, before this goes any further,
you should know...

...that all forms of physical contact
up to and including coitus are off the table.

May I buy you a beverage?

Tepid water, please.

Good God, what have we done?

And now the
kung pao chicken.

Ah, yeah.
Wow.

Smooth.

And finally,

my moo shu pork.

Whoo-hoo!

Oh, there you have
it, gentlemen.

Our entire dinner
unpacked by robot.

And it only took 28 minutes.

Impressive,

but we must be cautious.
Why?

Today, it's a Chinese food
retrieval robot.

Tomorrow,
it travels back in time

and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

I don't think that's
going to happen, Sheldon.

No one ever does.

That's why it happens.

Hey. Is the food here?

Ooh. What's that?

That, dear lady,

is the Wolowitz
Programmable Hand,

designed
for extravehicular repairs

on the International
Space Station.

Ah, cool.

Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

Oh, does that come up much
on the space station?

Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.

All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Coming up.

So how's work?

Oh, it's not bad.

Kind of hungry.

Yeah, we all are.

Just wait.

You realize, Penny,
that the technology

that went into this arm
will one day make

unskilled food servers
such as yourself obsolete.

Really?

They're going to make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?

I thought you
broke up with her.

Why is she here?

Okay, here we go.

Passing the soy sauce.

Put out your hand.

Oh!

That's amazing.

I wouldn't say amazing.

At best,
it's a modest leap forward

from the basic technology

that gave us
Country Bear Jamboree.

Hey, Sheldon?

Yes?

Peace?

No, not peace.

Hang on.

Does NASA know you're using
that thing as a napkin holder?

You kidding? They still think
it's in a secure locker at JPL.

You stole it?

Borrowed.

The trick is to carry it out
to your car like you own it.

Excuse me.

Oh.

Amy's at the dry cleaners,

and she's made a very
amusing pun.

"I don't care
for perchloroethylene,

and I don't like glycol ether."

Get it?

She doesn't like glycol <i>ether.</i>

Sounds like "either."

"L-O-L."

Who's Amy?
His girlfriend.

Sheldon has a girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.

How long
has this been going on?
Four months.

She's not my girlfriend.
Are you telling me, for
the past four months

I have been asking you,
"What's new?"

and you never thought
to go with,

"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

She's <i>not</i> my girlfriend.

Ah... d-d-d-d...

How did they meet?

Raj and I entered Sheldon's
information on a dating site,

and it spit out
Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, my God!
Sheldon and Amy.

Or, as we
call them, "Shamy."

Shamy.

I am so digging the Shamy.

All right,
everyone pay attention.

Yes, I have a friend
named Amy Farrah Fowler.

Yes, she is female.

Yes, we communicate
on a daily basis,

but no, she is not
my girlfriend.

Okay, well, what do
you communicate about?

Well, my work in physics,
her work in neurobiology,

and most recently,
the possibility

of our having a child together.

Thank you.

Wait a minute-- a child?

You never see this girl.

You just e-mail
and text and Twitter.

Now you're considering
having a baby?

Amy pointed out
that between the two of us,

our genetic material
has the potential

of producing the first in a line

of intellectually superior,
benign overlords

to guide humanity
to a brighter tomorrow.

I'm guessing
that future historians

will condemn us
for not taking

this opportunity
to kill Sheldon.

Okay, I have
a question.

Yes, Penny.

You don't even like people
touching you.

How are you going to have sex?

Why on Earth would we have sex?

Oh, honey, did your mom
not have the talk with you?

You know, when your
private parts started growing?

I'm quite aware of the way
humans usually reproduce,

which is messy,
unsanitary,

and based on living next
to you for three years,

involves loud and unnecessary
appeals to a deity.

Oh, God.

Yes, exactly.

Consequently,
if Amy and I choose

to bring new life
into this world,

it will be accomplished
clinically,

with fertility experts in a lab
with petri dishes.

Which reminds me--

you have broad hips
and a certain corn-fed vigor.

Is your womb available
for rental?

Still digging the Shamy?

Look, Sheldon,

before you race off to
the fertility clinic,

you might want
to think about--

uh, gee, I don't know--

maybe actually spending
some time with her.

You mean dating?
Yeah.

I can't date Amy.
Why not?

She's not my girlfriend.

Okay, look, don't think of it
as dating a girlfriend.

Think of it as, uh...

getting to know
the future mother of your child.

Oh.

I hadn't considered that.

I suppose she will have
to have access to our progeny.

And you don't think
I can achieve

the required intimacy
via text messaging?

Probably not.

Huh.

It would appear as if

the phone companies
have been lying to me.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

You do realize I stand
on the other side of the door

waiting for you to finish
knocking three times.

I know. I can see the shadow
of your feet under the door.

Yeah, my point is
it's a waste of time.

If you're looking for an example

of a waste of time,
I would refer you

to the conversation
we're having right now.

What do you want?

I've decided to take your advice
and have arranged

to go on a date
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, that's great.

Have fun.
Wait.

You have to drive me.

What?
You know I don't drive.

Well, go ask Leonard.
I did.

He said-- and I quote--
"Ask Penny.

It was her cockamamy idea."

Leonard said "cockamamy"?

Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

Having been raised
in a Christian household,

I'm uncomfortable
with the language he used.

And to be honest,

I'm not entirely comfortable
with "cockamamy."

Okay, fine. When's the date?

Now.
Now?

Hurry. We're going to be late.

Sheldon,
did it ever occur to you

that I might have other plans?

I'm sorry.

Do you have other plans?

Well, no, not per se, but...

So this conversation
is as pointless

as your door-knocking soliloquy?

Let me get my...
cockamamy keys.

Oh, God, that feels so good.

Yeah, that's the spot.

Oh, baby.

MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, dinner's ready!

I'll eat later.

I'm busy!

Oh, yeah.

Just like a real hand.

Hmm.

Thank you
for driving me.

You're welcome.

I wish you weren't
wearing flip-flops.

It's dangerous
to drive in flip-flops.

Sheldon.
Sorry.

I just don't want to be
yet another flip-flop fatality.

Can I ask you
a question?

Given your
community college education,

I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.

Yeah.
Well, my question is--

and I'm pretty sure
I know the answer--

is this your first date?

That depends.

Does square-dancing
with my sister

at a Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July Hoedown

count as a date?

No.

Then, this is my first date.

Okay. Well, then,
there's a couple of things

you should probably know.

I have a master's degree
and two doctorates.

The things I should know,
I do know.

My point is, I know more
about dating than you,

and if you were as smart
as you think you are,

you would listen to me.

If you know so much,
how come I have a date tonight

and you have nothing better
to do than drive me to it?

Fair point.

You know,
there's something

I've always wondered
about Aquaman.

Yeah?
Where does he poop?

What?

What would a toilet
look like in Atlantis?

How would you flush it?

And when you did flush it,
where would the poop go?

Hold that thought.

Hey, Howard.
What's going on?

What...

Hold on.
Howard, Howard, slow down.

The robot hand
is stuck on your what?

You're not going
to believe this.

So, um, Amy,
Sheldon tells me

you're a neuro...
something-or-other.

Neurobiologist.

Your "check engine" light is on.

Yeah, it's okay.

But the light indicates...

Don't bother.

I've wasted many an hour

tilting at
that particular windmill.

Uh, what is that
scent you're wearing?

It smells great.

Dandruff shampoo.

I have dry scalp.

Ah.

Well, your hair
looks very nice.

Are you a homosexual?

No, no, I'm just giving
you a compliment.

Hmm.

Would have been more flattered
if you were a homosexual.

Guys, how 'bout
some music?

Oh, no, I wouldn't
care for that.

Amy?

No, thank you.

Okay.

Uncomfortable
silence it is.

Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

what it was like for you
growing up in Texas?

No.

Well, why don't
you tell her?

All right.

It was hell.

Any follow up, Amy?

No.

I myself grew
up in Nebraska.

Small town
outside of Omaha.

Nice place, mostly family farms,
a few meth labs.

I'm sorry, how is this better
than uncomfortable silence?

I don't know.

I was just trying something.

Muggles.

You slipped and fell
into a robot hand?

Yes.

Penis first?

Yes. Now, help me!

I'd suggest a lubricant,
but I have a feeling

you fell on some
of that as well.

Not funny, Leonard.

Really? A robot hand's got
a death grip on your junk, dude.

That's funny, ask anyone.

Plea-- before my mother
walks in, get this off me!

Okay, let's see.

No, no!
Don't touch.

The program
is paused.

Well, then let's
un-pause it.

No, no! I loaded
the wrong program.

The hand thinks it's holding
a screwdriver in outer space.

If you continue the program,
it's gonna start twisting.

A-All right.

Um, how about this.

When-when Winnie the Pooh
got his head stuck

in the honey tree,
his friends all grabbed onto him

and pulled and pulled.

You do what you want,

I'm not touching another
man's honey tree.

All right, uh,
forget pulling.

How about we get
an electric saw and cut it off?

What?! No saws!

One circumcision was enough.

How about an
acetylene torch?

Okay, I can't believe
this needs to be said out loud.

No pulling, no saws, no torches.

Well, then what do
you want us to do?

MRS. WOLOWITZ
Howard, I made cookies for you

and your little friends!

That's great, Mom, thanks!

I'll bring them up
with some Hawaiian Punch!

Don't come up here!

Why not?! Are you
ashamed of your mother?!

Yes, but that's not the point!

Get me out of here.

You have any ideas, Raj?

Right now, all I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

Hey, here's another possible
topic of conversation.

This is a big night for Sheldon.

Right, Sheldon?

Big night?

The winter solstice
is a big night.

It's over 14 hours

in Southern California.

That's an amusing factoid.

Thank you.

No, no.

My point is, uh, tonight is
Sheldon's first official date.

Discuss.

Is this true?

Apparently, a semi-incestuous
Teens for Jesus

Fourth of July Hoedown
didn't count.

So, um, Amy, what about you?

Do you date much?

Once a year.

It's a deal I made
with my mother in exchange for

her silence on the matter,
as well as the occasional use

of her George Foreman Grill

that seals in the flavor
without the fat.

How about you, Penny?

Do you go on many dates?

Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

A few.

What's...
?

Your characterization of

approximately 171 different men
as "a few."

What...

Where did you
get 171 men?

Simple extrapolation.

In the three years
that I've known you,

you were single for two.

During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

If we work backwards,
correcting for observation bias

and postulate an initial
dating age of 15...

Whoa, wait,
wait, wait.

I did not start dating at 15.

I'm sorry. Sixteen?

Fourteen.

My mistake.

Now, assuming the left side
of a bell curve

peaking around the present,
that would bring the total

up to 193 men.

Plus or minus eight men.

Remarkable.

Did you have sexual intercourse
with all of these men?

No.

Although that number would be

fairly easy
to calculate.
Oh.

Based on the number of
awkward encounters I've had

with strange men leaving
her apartment in the morning,

plus the number of times

she's returned home
wearing the same clothes

she wore the night before...

Okay, Sheldon, I think
you've made your point.

So we multiply 193--

minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity--

so 172

times 0.18 gives us...

30.96 sexual partners.

Let's round that up to 31.

Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

That is not even close
to the real number.

I'm gonna need
a drink over here.

This is very interesting.

Cultural perceptions
are subjective.

Penny, to your mind,
are you a slut?

No! No!

No.

Let's just all finish
our dinners, okay?

This is
an interesting topic.

How many sexual encounters
have you had?

Does volunteering
for a scientific experiment

in which orgasm was achieved
by electronically

stimulating the pleasure centers
of the brain count?

I should think so.

Then 128.

Okay, come on.

Almost there.

Don't tug.
No tugging.

Next time, take your own advice.

Excuse me,
could you help us out?

My, my, my.

What do we have here?

I slipped and fell.

Yeah, we get that a lot.

What is this?

It's a robot arm.

Where's the rest of the robot?

I only built the arm.

'Cause that's all
you needed, right?

Can you please
just help me?!

All right, all right.

Hang on, stay calm.

I need an orderly
with a wheelchair.

I got a robot hand grasping
a man's penis out here.

You think you could be
a little more discreet?

I'm sorry,
we don't have a code for

"robot hand
grasping a man's penis."

Why is it hooked up
to a computer?

Uh, it's what
controls the arm.

But it's frozen.

Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

No, you see, it's more
complicated than that.

No, wait!

Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

You were right.

This was a very
productive evening.

I saw a whole new side of
Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

I did not have
sex with 31 guys.

I'll be happy
to check the math,

but numbers
don't lie, Penny.

In any event,

now that Amy and I have
spent quality time together,

I feel much
more confident

proceeding to the next
stage of our relationship.

And that is?

Using in vitro
fertilization

and a surrogate uterus to
gift humanity with our progeny.

You're still
on that?

In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

Okay, you know what?

I'm gonna come at this
in a whole new way.

Sheldon, if you try to make
a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

I'm gonna tell
your mother on you.

That's no threat.

My mother's always
wanted a grandchild.

Really? Your deeply religious
born-again Christian mother

wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

Curses.

If I'd thought of that
in the first place,

I could've saved myself
this whole night.

Well, it's not that late.

You could still go out
and look for number 32.

Good night.

Hey, Howard,
what's up?

I've decided
not to procreate.

Yeah, yeah, great.

Howard, uh, slow down.

What do you mean
it happened again?

Whatcha doin' there?

Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner?

The humorous implication being
that I am Wile E. Coyote?

Yes.

And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device

that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

Yes.

What I'm doing here

is trying to determine
when I'm going to die.

A lot of people are working
on that research.

So what is all this?

My family history
factoring in longevity,

propensity for disease,
et cetera.

Interesting.

Cause of death for
Uncle Carl was KBB.

What's "KBB"?

"Killed by badger."

How's that?

It was Thanksgiving.

Uncle Carl said, "I think

"there's a badger living
in our chimney.

Hand me that flashlight."

Those were the last words

he ever spoke to us.

I don't think you need

to worry about death by badgers
being hereditary.

Not true.

The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

Instead of fleeing, he chose
to fight barehanded

against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

Who's to say that I don't share
that flawed DNA?

You can always get a badger
and find out.

But seriously,

even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor,

at best I have 60 years left.

That long, huh?

60 only takes me to here.

I need to get to here.

What's there?

The earliest estimate
of the singularity,

when man will be able
to transfer his consciousness

into machines
and achieve immortality.

So, you're upset
about missing out

on becoming some sort of
freakish self-aware robot?

By this much.

Tough break.

You want eggs?

You don't get it, Leonard.

I'm going to miss so much--

the unified field theory,
cold fusion, the dogapus.

What's a dogapus?

The hybrid dog and octopus.

Man's underwater best friend.

Is somebody
working on that?

I was going to.

I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

Wait a minute.
You hate dogs.

A dogapus can play fetch
with eight balls.

No one can hate that.

What do we owe you?

It came to $28.17.

Let's say six bucks apiece.

Here you go.

Thank you.

What?

Never mind. I got it.

Oh, you wanted me to pay.

It's no big deal.
No, no, no, no.
You're right.

We're not going out anymore;
I should pay for myself.

What?

He said, "If he had
woman parts,

he'd eat for free
the rest of his life".

Yeah, but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

I'm a little low on cash.

How much you got?
Nothing.

How can you walk
around with no money?

I'm cute. I get by.

It's okay,
you can owe me.

Thank you.
Sheldon, six bucks.

No, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

But it's Thursday.

Thursday's pizza night.

Not for me.

Thursday is now Cruciferous
Vegetable Night.

Tonight's selection:
Brussels sprouts.

Really?

You're changing the
Sheldonian calendar?

It's a small price to pay.
For what?

No, no, don't ask.
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

In order to live long enough
to fuse my consciousness

with cybernetics,
I need to change my diet.

Wait. Cybernetics is
robot stuff, right?

Correct.

So you want to turn yourself

into some sort of robot?

Essentially, yes.

Okay, here's my question.

Didn't you already do that?

No.

Flattering, but sadly, no.

I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen

designed to strengthen
my cardiovascular system.

AKA jogging.

Wait. Honey,
have you ever run before?

Certainly.

I've run from bullies, dogs,
angry chickens...

and one particularly
persistent P.E. teacher

determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

You're right.
Penny jogs.

Maybe you guys
can run together.

That's an excellent idea.

Yeah, if we chat,

it will create the illusion
of time going faster.

No, it won't.

Um, how does he know I jog?

Oh, he watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

I know!

And he says he's
not gonna stop.

Then see a shrink
and figure out how
to talk to women.

What the hell?

What's the matter?

I have pain radiating
from my navel

to my lower right abdomen.

I'm nauseated
and feverish.

I believe I may have cholera.

There's no cholera
in Pasadena.

Just like last summer,

when there
was no malaria
in Pasadena.

Well, if it's not cholera,

then based on a quick
Internet search,

the other explanations in
decreasing order of likelihood

are Hirschsprung's Disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

When would you have accidentally
eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

It's part of an
unlikely scenario

that involves sleepwalking
and a 24-hour flower mart

with a less-than-
vigilant proprietor.

Oh, Lord, my belly!

Ever had your
appendix out?

I haven't.

I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

Let's get you
to the hospital.

So this is how it ends...

with cruel irony.

Just as I make the commitment
to preserving my body,

I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

Do you know

the original purpose
of the appendix, Leonard?

No.

I do. And yet I'm doomed

while you live on.

Funny how things
work out, isn't it?

Oh, Lord, I think
it's about to burst!

On the other hand,

it might have been
the Brussels sprouts.

Good night.

Appendicitis.

What a nervous Nelly.

Penny! Penny!

Penny!

Coming, coming.

Hey, nice knees.

Thank you.

They're my mother's.

Oh.
And the Flash
shirt is what?

Because, what,
you're gonna run really fast?

No, the Flash shirt is
because it's Friday,

but it's nice when
things work out.

Where's your
heart rate monitor?
I don't have one.

What about your pedometer?
Don't have one.

Do you have telematics
in your shoes connected
to an iPod?

Uh, no.
What do you do,

you just go out there
and gambol about
like a bunny?

No. I just run till I'm hungry,
then I stop for a bear claw.

Why are you doing that?

It's good to stretch your
muscles before you run.

All right.
All right,

let's start with a toe touch.

Okay, you do it.

I <i>am</i> doing it.

Oh. Wow. Good job.

Okay, um,

can you do this?

We'll never know.

Okay, let's just warm up
on the run.

Okay.
Okay, let's go.

I've been reading up
on biomechanics.

I think you'll be
surprised at my...

Oh, my God,
are you okay?

I think so.

Oh, let me
help you up.
Thank you.

Oh, Sheldon!

If it makes you
feel any better,

Thursday is no longer
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

Here's my chicken curry.

Howard, your
shrimp biryani.

Thank you, sir.
Palak paneer,
that's Penny.

Thanks.
And for Rajesh
Koothrappali,

from whose homeland
these tasty dishes originate,

one large order of
chicken McNuggets.

Hey, what's my share?
Uh... 12 bucks.

Okay, can I get you after Friday
when I get paid?
Sure.

What am I up to now?

Well, okay, with
the Indian food, the pizza,

the Thai food, the tank of gas,

the frozen yogurt

and your rent, uh...

a little over $1,400.

What now?

He's just expressing
his admiration that

you don't even have to
put out to get free stuff.

It's not free-- I'm
gonna pay him back.

Shut up!

Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

Coming!

Greetings, friends.

Greetings, whatever
the hell you are.

I am a mobile
virtual presence device.

Recent events

have demonstrated to me
that my body is too fragile

to endure the vicissitudes
of the world.

Until such time as I am able

to transfer my consciousness,

I shall remain
in a secure location

and interact with the world
in this manner.

Really? That's
your question--

when did he
put a ramp in?

You're in my spot.

This may seem a little odd
at first,

but over time,
you'll grow accustomed

to dealing with me
in this configuration.

Yeah, to be honest, I
don't see much difference.

Thank you.

That's what I was going for.

Now, Leonard, tomorrow,
when we go to work,

you'll need to allow
some extra time

to get me down the stairs.

For your convenience,
I disassemble into four pieces.

This is ridiculous.

I'm coming to talk to you.

You don't know where I am.

My physical body
is safely ensconced

in a secure,
undisclosed location.

You're in your bedroom.

No, I'm not.

I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

No, you can't.

Wait.

Come back.

Halt.

Authorized personnel only!

So, either one
of you weirdos

want to buy my underwear?
Only 1,400 bucks.

Sheldon,
this is ridiculous.

I'm behind you.

Please look at me when
you're talking to me.

I am looking at you.

No, you're not.

Pay no attention to
that man in the bed.

You cannot exist

as a virtual presence.

Not here
and certainly not at work.

Oh, good God.

At my age,
do you know

how I'm statistically
most likely to die?

At the hands of your roommate?

An accident.

That's how I'm going
to make it look.

Until I can transfer
my intellect

to a more durable container,

my body will remain
safely ensconced in my bed.

Fine, but don't expect my help.

You have to help--
it's in the roommate agreement.

No, it's not.

Section 74.C.

The various obligations
and duties of the parties

in the event one of
them becomes a robot.

I'll be damned.

This is delightful.

Uh-huh.

It's much easier to enjoy

the picturesque route
we travel to work

when you remove the specter
of fiery vehicular death.

Refresh my memory.

Why didn't I just put you
in the trunk?

Because I called shotgun.
Remember?

Right.

You seem tense.

Perhaps this will relax you.

I don't want to listen
to music, Sheldon.

Very well.

I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.

Together, in this car,
with my enhanced capabilities,

we're like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

Except in <i>Knight Rider,</i> the car
isn't a yammering sphincter.

You mock the sphincter,

but the sphincter
is a class of muscle

without which human beings
couldn't survive.

There are over 50
different sphincters

in the human body.

How many can you name?

I was wrong-- this is exactly
like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.

No.

This is a photograph of the 1911

Solvay Conference on the theory
of radiation and quanta.

Using Photoshop, I've
introduced a few anachronisms.

See if you can spot all 24.

I'll give you the first one.

Madame Curie should not
be wearing a digital watch.

And go.

That's it. Bye-bye.

Bazinga.
Whoa!

I have an override switch.

I almost died!

And I'm safe and sound in bed.

Who's crazy now?

I'm still going
to go with you.

Hello, Professor Hoskins.

Nice to see you, Mindy.

And <i>konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.</i>

Sorry the Swedes
disproved your theory.

Leonard, my door.

What about it?

Be a lamb and open it for me.

Why? What's the problem?

You think you have me stymied,
don't you?

No, I think a doorknob
has you stymied.

Oh, look, it's Leonard
and R2-D-Bag.

That's my joke.
I told it last night.

You can't just use it.

Raj, be a lamb
and open the door for me.

Oh, sure.

He's a lamb.

You're not.

I'm a lamb.

Isn't this nice?

The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie

without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.

I say we just take him
to Tatooine

and sell him to some Jawas.

That's two, dude.

Write your own jokes.

Oh, great.

Hi, I'm Penny,
I'll be your waitress.

Why are you introducing
yourself?

I'd rather people not know

I have any prior connection
to you whatsoever.

Can you tell me
the specials this evening?

Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.

Obviously.

I don't even have
water yet.

Because you're not here.

That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

I'm going to have
to go over your head.

Manager... manager.

Oh, Lord,
look who it is.

Is that Steve Wozniak?

I think it is.

The Great and Powerful Woz.

Penny,
Steve Wozniak was

one of the cofounders

of Apple Computer.

He and Steve Jobs started it...
Yeah,

I know who he is.
I watch <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

I must speak to him.

Of course you must.

You know, there's an
Olive Garden down the street.

You guys should try it sometime.

Excuse me,
Mr. Wozniak?

Oh, hey.

Nice virtual presence device.

Thank you.

I just want to say
I'm a big fan.

You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.

Only 15th?

It's still six spots
above Steve Jobs.

I care neither for turtlenecks

nor showmanship.

Yeah, I never got
that turtleneck thing.

One of my proudest possessions
is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.

Despite the file system
limitations of Apple DOS 3.3,

it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.

Thanks, we were shooting
for "nifty."

You know, if you had it here,

I'd autograph it for you.

Don't move
for 15 to 30 minutes,

depending on how
the buses are running.

Nerds.

I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

Ow!

Oh!

Aw.

Penny... Penny... Penny.

What up, Shel-Bot?

I can't get out of bed.

I hurt my ankle.

What do you want me to do?

Sing me "Soft Kitty."

Really, you want me
to sing "Soft Kitty"

to a computer monitor?

Would you rather come over
and sing it to me in person?

âª Soft kitty, warm kitty âª

âª Little ball of fur... âª

Closer to the microphone.

âª Happy kitty,
sleepy... âª

No.

You have to start over.

âª Soft kitty,
warm kitty âª

âª Little ball of fur âª

âª Happy kitty,
sleepy kitty âª

âª Purr, purr, purr. âª

All right, I'm ready
for my next question.

In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets,

who wins the Second World War?

Uganda.

Defend.

Kenya rises to power

on the export of rhinoceroses.

A Central African
power block is formed,

colonizing North Africa and Europe.

When war breaks out, no one can
afford the luxury of a rhino.

Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

Correct.

My turn.

In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument,

on what does Scott Joplin
play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

Tuned bayonets.

Defend.

Isn't it obvious?

You're right. My apologies.

What the hell are you guys playing?

It's a game we invented.

It's called Counterfactuals.

We postulate an alternate
world that differs from ours

in one key aspect and then
pose questions to each other.

It's fun for ages eight to 80.

Join us.

All right.

I like a good brainteaser.

Give it a whirl.

You're in luck;
this is an easy one.

In a world where mankind is ruled

by a giant intelligent beaver,

what food is no longer consumed?

Uh... a BLT where the
"B" stands for beaver?

I don't know.

Leonard, be serious.

We're playing a game here.

(clears throat)

I can figure this out.

Let's see.

Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

The only tree bark I know that
humans consume is cinnamon.

So, I'll say cinnamon.

Incorrect.

Obviously, the answer
is cheese Danish.

What?

In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

mankind builds many dams to
please the beaver overlord.

The low-lying city of
Copenhagen is flooded.

Thousands die.

Devastated, the Danes never
invent their namesake pastry.

How does one miss that?

This is ridiculous.

You're just making stuff up.

Is he always like
this when he loses?

Oh, yes.

You should've been here for the
great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

You bumped the table
and you know it.

Perhaps it would be
kinder to play a game

more suited to his abilities.

We'll close our eyes and
count to ten while you hide.

I'm going to my room.

Very good, Leonard.

But next time, don't tell
us where you're hiding.

âª Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state âª

âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

âª The Earth began to cool âª

âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

âª We built the Wall âª âª <i>We
built the pyramids</i> âª

âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

âª That all started
with a big bang âª

Did you guys see the paper

in <i>The American Physics
Journal</i> on supersolids?

It's pretty interesting.

This guy's working from
a hypothesis where...

Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

What? Don't ruin it for me, man.

I printed out a PDF
to read on the potty.

On the potty?

What are you, five?

It's a potty. What do you call it?

Toilet.

That's a little vulgar for

the dinner table, don't you think?

Oh, and "potty" is okay?

"Potty" is innocent.

"Potty" is adorable.

What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

If I don't have to boom-boom.

Greetings.

You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

Nice to see you. Hello.

Sorry we're late.

I must take responsibility.

I had to stop for
feminine hygiene supplies.

Aha. Okay.

I believe she's
experiencing her menses.

Actually, I'm not.

In order to avoid surprises,
I wear them all the time.

Aha. Okay.

"Toilet's" sounding
pretty good now, huh?

Hey, look, it's Shamy.

Shamy?

A juvenile amalgamation
of our names.

Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

Oh.

I don't like that.

Don't do that.

(awkward chuckle)

All righty. What's new?

Well, just recently, I learned
that you refer to us as Shamy,

and I don't like that.

I got it.

But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

Like everybody else's.

Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

Thank you for asking.

Why is she not taking our order?

I should've warned you,

one has to navigate a
labyrinth of social nonsense

before one can be fed here.

AMY: Really?

I assumed an establishment called

the Cheesecake Factory would
function more efficiently.

It's how they lure you in.

I believe it's called "
bait and switch."

Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

'cause... I don't want to be here.

So, this is nice.

First time we've all
gotten together to eat.

You're right, he's a
festival of humdrum chitchat.

Okay, that's all I got.

Howard, you're up.

Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

I doubt you'd understand.

Sheldon tells me you only
have a master's degree.

Raj, do you have any
questions for Amy?

I'm curious as to why
we're not eating alone.

They can't function without me.

I'm the social glue that holds
this little group together.

You're welcome.

Listen, can I talk to you
about your girlfriend?

She's not my girlfriend.

She's a girl and she's my friend,

but there's no touching or
unsanitary exchange of saliva.

Got it.

Although, for the record,
on one occasion,

she licked her thumb to
remove raspberry jelly

from the corner of my mouth.

It's an action we both
regret to this day.

Uh-huh.

Anyway, I'm not sure
she's the best fit

for our little-- how should
we call it-- rebel alliance.

Oh, I never identified
with the rebel alliance.

Despite their tendency
to build Death Stars,

I've always been more
of an empire man.

Yeah, not my point.

I know what your point is.

You're intimidated
by Amy's intellect.

To that I say, buck up.

Okay, let me just

get right to it.

Amy is judgmental,
sanctimonious and frankly...

just obnoxious.

So?

So we already have
you for all that.

Are you suggesting I terminate
my relationship with Amy?

No, no, of course not.

Just have your relationship
someplace else.

May I point out that
for eight long months,

I suffered in silence
as your female companion

filled our apartment with her

off-key country music caterwauling,

the unappetizing spectacle

of her grinding a pumice stone
against her calloused feet

in our living room,

and night after night of
uninformative TV documentaries

about the Jersey Shore.

Suffered in silence?

Yes.

And I'd thank you to do the same.

Reall-- Silence?!

(sighs): Ah.

Nothing makes beer
taste better than

cool clear Rocky
Mountain spring water.

Where are the Rocky
Mountains, anyway?

Philadelphia.

Really?

I thought they were
out West someplace.

Think about it, Raj.

Where did the movie
<i>Rocky</i> take place?

Philadelphia.

Okay, now I get it.

So this is the plan?

From now on, we're just
gonna hide out in here

to avoid the Shamy?

I'm very comfortable here.

Penny, dear, why don't you shoot
another silver bullet my way?

Get one yourself.

Ooh, somebody's been
taking bitchy pills.

God, he's an ass when he drinks.

Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

You just don't hear it.

Think we need to start
entertaining the possibility

that the Shamy could
go on for years.

Well, if that's the case,
Penny will have to get satellite TV

and maybe once a week run a
vacuum through this place.

I thought you were going
to talk to Sheldon.

I did. Well, what'd he say?

Well, he pointed out that
he kinda sorta had to...

put up with you.

Kinda sorta had to?

I didn't agree with him.

Well, you defended me, right?

I tried, but...

...he made a fairly
well-reasoned argument.

You're not doing that right.

What?

Gimme.

No. Trust me.

No! I do this for
my mom all the time.

See?

With the grain.

Wow, that is better.

And someday, when you
have varicose veins,

I'll show you how to massage them.

Oh, God, never again.

I assume by "never again,
" you mean never again will you drink

all of Penny's beer,
then run down to the gas station

for a couple of 40s,
a box of Slim Jims

and the latest issue of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

I was homesick.

The highlight of the evening
was when you showed us

your Bollywood break
dancing skills.

(humming Indian music)

That's very offensive.

Yeah, we all thought so.

LEONARD: Oh, no.

What?

It's John and Yoko.

More like Yoko and Yoko.

Greetings. Hey.

I brought Amy here

to show her some of
the work I'm doing.

It's very impressive,
for theoretical work.

Do I detect a hint
of condescension?

I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

I meant compared to the
real-world applications

of neurobiology,
theoretical physics is--

what's the word I'm looking for?--
hmm, cute.

(Leonard and Wolowitz oohing)

Are you suggesting the
work of a neurobiologist

like Babinski could ever
rise to the significance

of a physicist like
Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?

I'm stating it outright.

Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

You take that back.

Absolutely not.

My colleagues and I are mapping

the neurological
substrates that subserve

global information processing,

which is required for
all cognitive reasoning,

including scientific inquiry,
making my research ipso facto

prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

That means it's better
than his research,

and by extension, of course, yours.

I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

to work on the defecating
Clark Maxwell, so...

Excuse me, but a
grand unified theory,

insofar as it explains everything,

will ipso facto
explain neurobiology.

Yes, but if I'm successful,

I will be able to map and
reproduce your thought processes

in deriving a grand unified theory,

and therefore, subsume your
conclusions under my paradigm.

That's the rankest psychologism,

and was conclusively
revealed as hogwash

by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

We appear to have
reached an impasse.

I agree.

I move our relationship
terminate immediately.

Seconded.

There being no objections...

ALL: Uh-uh.

...the motion carries.

Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

Women, huh?

Can't live with them,

can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

Amen to that.

Hey, Sheldon.

Hello.

I hear you broke up with Amy.

A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

She was a girl who was my friend

who is now a girl who
is not my friend.

Wow. That's like the
worst country song ever.

So, how are you doing?

Regarding what?

Amy.

I don't follow.

Well, breakups-- or whatever the
hell this is-- can be tough.

Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual,

There were no emotional bonds,

the severing of which would
cause me any discomfort.

The relationship simply
outlived its utility,

and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

Okay. Good.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

I gotta tell you guys,

I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

We're all a little
worried about Sheldon.

No, I mean since the
Shamy hit a reef.

Oh, I thought you were just
making a generalization:

"You know,
I'm worried about Sheldon

"someday setting off a
low-yield nuclear device

because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O."

What does "hit a reef" mean?

Uh, went splitsville.

Pardon?

Turned to boom-boom.

Ah.

I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

You should lend him your copy of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

He got a cat to keep him company.

You're kidding.

He takes it everywhere:

to bed, to the bathroom.

He takes the kitty to the potty?

I thought we discussed the P-word.

Don't try to change me, dude.

I am what I am.

Oh, gentlemen.

Hey. Aren't you going
to introduce us

to your little friend?

My apologies.

Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer.

Hello. Hi.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

the father of the atomic
bomb wants a saucer of milk.

Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

Yeah.

Hey.

Oh, no.

Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

So you decided to get the
whole Manhattan Project?

Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman,
Edward Teller,  Otto Frisch...

...Zazzles.
- Zazzles?

I was going to name him Hermann Von Helmholtz

but he's so zazzy.

Okay, we need to talk.

About what?

Cats, Sheldon.

You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone,

and you're trying to replace
her with a bunch of cats.

Clowder. What?

A group of cats is a clowder.
Or a glaring.

Okay, yeah, fine.

It's the kind of thing you ought

to know now that we have one.

Terrific. My point is,
you need to face up

to what you're feeling
with this breakup.

It wasn't a breakup.

A breakup would imply that
Amy was my girlfriend.

Okay, I got it, I got it;
she's not your girlfriend.

Now listen to me.

I know about loneliness.

I know about trying to replace
someone with other stuff.

When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello,

I built a bunch of model rockets,

I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

You didn't break up,
she dumped you.

She didn't dump me.

It was mutual!

I was there. She dumped you.

Okay, fine.

Live with cats.

Be like my Aunt Nancy.

She had dozens of them.

And do you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

You don't have to sell
me on cats, Leonard.

I'm already a fan.

All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

Well, that's not fancy at all.

Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

Where is he?

He's in his bedroom.

Now, when you said on the phone

he broke up with a girl,
you meant an actual girl,

not something you kids
whipped up in a lab?

No, she's real.

Did they sin?

No, no, it's not like that.

It's, uh...

I don't know what it's like.

But there is something I
should prepare you for.

Oh, relax, Leonard,
I have raised that boy.

I've seen him at his best,
I've seen him at his worst.

There's nothing he can
do that'll surprise me.

Hold on to that thought.

(knocks)

Come in.

(cats meowing)

Surprise.

Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

My, my, that's a powerful smell.

I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky,

Feynman, Weisskopf...

Yeah, I get it.

You got a lot of cats

and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

What are you doing here?

Leonard called.

And he said that you were
pining for a young lady.

Oh, that's preposterous.

I'm not pining over anyone.

Oh, lambchop, we can
quibble what to call it,

but I think we can
both agree it's creepy.

I do not agree.

Cats make wonderful companions.

They don't argue or question
my intellectual authority,

and this little guy here,

I think you'll find
to be quite zazzy.

You should have called sooner.

Shelly! Dinner's ready!

SHELDON: Coming!

No cats!

Aw...

What is she doing here?

I called her.

Your mother thinks

you might be losing
your mind over me.

As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

Well, rest assured, I am in
full possession of my faculties.

(sneezes): 25 cats!

Oh, God bless you, dear.

Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

All right, but you're
not fooling me.

Whenever you say we have to talk,

it means you want me to listen.

Then stop talking.

Yes, ma'am.

Now, the reason I
called Amy over was

to find out what type
of person she is.

And after chatting a bit,

I have to say that while she is a

<i>perfectly</i> unique young woman,

you two are definitely not
suited for each other.

That's a peculiar conclusion.

By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me

than anyone I've ever met.

Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly,
I can't see it.

Well, whether you see
it or not is irrelevant.

I can't see subatomic particles,

but nevertheless, they're there.

Excellent point.

A physics point.

TouchÃ©.

Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

it's a good thing that

you two decided to
end the relationship

so I didn't have to end it for you.

Amy, after consideration,

I believe we may have acted rashly.

I propose we resume
our relationship

and attempt to resolve
our differences.

I'll agree to that only
if you'll stipulate

that 80% of our difficulties
were caused by you.

I'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.

Done.

You understand that moving forward,

we deal with the fact that my
mother does not approve of you?

I do. I find being cast

in the role of bad
girl oddly titillating.

Would you like to see my cats?

I would. I love cats.

They're the epitome
of indifference.

Ah, then you may find
Zazzles a little cloying.

I saw what you did there.

He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

He's no different from any man.

You tell 'em not to do
something, that's all

they want to do.

If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

not to clear out the
wood chipper by hand,

we'd still be calling him Edward.

Now, don't you move.

I'll bring over all the food.

No, no, no, I can do it.

Well, isn't that sweet?

Thank you, Amy.

Here's your cat.

And here's your $20.

AMY: Next!

Thank you, Amy.

Here's your cat.

And here's your $20.

AMY: Next!

I'm telling you, if xenon emits
ultraviolet light,

then those dark matter
discoveries must be wrong.

Yes, well, if we lived
in a world

where slow-moving xenon
produced light,

then you'd be correct.

Also, pigs would fly,

my derriere would produce
cotton candy,

and <i>The Phantom Menace</i>
would be a timeless classic.

Oh, you're so arrogant.

If you were a superhero,

your name would be
Captain Arrogant.

And you know
what your superpower would be?

Arrogance.

You're wrong again.

If my superpower were arrogance,
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

I love watching Raj and Sheldon
try to work together.

Yeah, it's like
if Alien and Predator decided

to go partners
in a Jamba Juice.

Has it occurred to you
you're missing the big picture?

If you look at neutron
scattering data...
Oh, Penny?

Penny?
What's up?

Nothing. I just wanted

to make Raj stop talking.

No, no, no.

He won. Suck it up.

Well, I'd ask you guys
if you want dessert,

but I know Sheldon doesn't
eat dessert on Tuesdays.

And even if Raj wanted
something, he couldn't tell me.

Howard won't order anything,

but he will come up
with some sort of skeevy comment

involving the words pie
or cheesecake.

And Leonard's
lactose intolerant,

so he can't eat anything here

without his intestines
blowing up

like a balloon animal.

Hang on a second.

I could have the fruit platter.

You want the fruit platter?

Does it have melon
on it?
Yeah.

No, I can't eat melon.

Oh, Howard,
heads up.

Your ex-girlfriend just
came in for her shift.

When was the last time
you saw her?

Oh, not since we broke up.

Wow. How am I going
to play this?

Sophisticated and relaxed?

Friendly, noncommittal?

Cold and distant?

Hi, guys.
Hey.

Hello.

I see you decided to go
with pathetic and frightened.

It's one of his best moves.

âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

âª The Earth began to cool âª

âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

âª We built the Wall âª
âª <i>We built the pyramids</i> âª

âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

âª That all started

So, my dear, we meet again.

Hello, Howard.

I've missed you.

I've missed you,
Katee Sackhoff.

One question.
Anything.

Why am I wearing my
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
flight suit in bed?

Why are <i>you</i> in bed with <i>me?</i>

If we start to question this,
it all falls apart.

Sorry.

Oh, ravish
me, Howard.

My loins
ache for you.

Okay, if you insist.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, have you seen

my girdle?!

No, Ma!

I can't find it, and I'm late
for my Weight Watchers meeting!

Maybe it committed suicide!

Leave me alone!

Now, where were we?

I believe you
were about

to rip off my uniform
with your teeth.

Bernadette?!

What are you doing here?

Well, if I had to
guess, I'd say I'm here

because you saw me
earlier this evening,

and you're still
hung up on me.

No, I'm not.

Clearly you are.

Otherwise, based
on past experience,

we'd be done by now.

Okay,
I'm a little confused here.

GEORGE TAKEI:
Oh, my.

Can I help?

Not that kind of confused.

What's George
Takei doing here?

Howard, do you have
latent homosexual tendencies?

No, of course not.

So you say.

Yet, here I am.

George, let me
ask you something.

How did you deal
with being typecast

as a science fiction icon?

It's difficult.

You try and stretch
as an actor--

do Strindberg, O'Neill,

but all they want is,
"Course laid in, Captain."

Tell me about it.

It's frackin'
frustrating.

Wait. Katee,
why are you leaving?

She's leaving because you
really want to be with me.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I found my girdle!

It was in the dryer!

Great, Ma!

I think it shrunk!

I'm spilling out like
the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

And with that mental picture,

I think we're done
for the evening.

You know, you never
told me what happened

between you
and Bernadette.

I did a stupid thing.

Yeah, I guessed that.

It was the kind of thing

that makes it kind of hard
to face her now.

That covers anything
from farting in bed

to killing a homeless guy.

Oh, my God.

You ran over a hobo.

No. Stop asking.

All right, fine. So you want to
get back together with her,

but you're too
ashamed to face her

because of whatever
it is you did.

In a nutshell.
Okay.

Well, how about this?

Kidnap Bernadette from the opera

wearing a creepy mask so
she doesn't know it's you.

Now, you see, I don't know
if you're kidding or not.

You're being
unreasonable.

Why can't
I have a desk?!

Our collaboration is a work
of the mind.

We don't need desks.

You have a desk.

Correct.
But I can't have one.

You're two for two.

Why can't he have a desk,
Sheldon?

Oh, Lord, will
this day never end?

As I've explained repeatedly
to Dr. Koothrappali,

whose ability to comprehend
the American idiom fails him

when it's convenient,

there's absolutely
no money

in my budget for
additional office furniture.

Oh, but there's money
for a drawer full of Red Vines,

a marshmallow shooting rifle,

and a super executive ant farm
with glow-in-the-dark sand?

Yes.

Okay, what if he
buys his own desk?

Yeah, what
if I buy my own desk?

That's ridiculous.
Why?

Because...

Yes?

It's my office.

Sheldon.
All right, all right.

He can buy his own desk.

And I can put it in your office?

Well, you really want

to dot the I's and cross
the T's, don't you?

Why would you want
a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

They do some
of their best work at night.

Ah, it's okay.

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

Would you have opened the door
if you knew it was me?

Not since I found out

the teddy bear you gave me
had a webcam in it.

I just have a question.

Does Bernadette
ever talk about me?

Oh, absolutely.

She does?
Yeah, sure.

Just yesterday, she asked,

"Why is Howard hiding
under the table?"

She saw that, huh?

Oh, no, not at first.

Right after I pointed it out.

Let me ask you something else.

Is she seeing anybody?

Oh, not that I know of.

Hey, while
we're on the subject,

why did you guys break up
anyway?

Oh, I'd rather not say.

Howard, if you want my help,
I've got to know what happened.

But it's embarrassing...

Yeah, that's what
I'm counting on. Spill.

Okay. Well, you know
<i>World of Warcraft?</i>

Um, the online game? Sure.

Well, did you know

that the characters in the game
can have sex with each other?

Oh, God. I think
I see where this is going.

Her name was
Glissinda the Troll.

Bernadette walked in on me

while we were doing
the cyber-nasty

under the Bridge of Souls.

Oh, you're right.

That is so embarrassing.

Would you talk to her?

Bernadette or the troll?

Bernadette. She
was so mad at me,

she wouldn't even listen
to my side of the story.

Well, what was your side?

Well, for all we know,

Glissinda the Troll
wasn't even a real woman.

I mean, she could've been
a 50-year-old truck driver

in New Jersey.

Really? And that didn't
make her feel better?

Will you talk to her, see
if there's any chance at all

we could get back together?

Oh, gee, Howard,
I really don't want

to get in the middle of this.

No. Why would you?

I'm just another lonely
nerd, living with his mother,

trying to find any scrap
of happiness he can.

You know, maybe to make up
for the fact that his dad

left him when
he was 11.

Okay, I will think about it.

You know, I've always
blamed myself

for him leaving.

I always thought it was because
I wasn't the son he wanted.

Yeah, I said I'd
think about it.

I wasn't athletic,
yeah, I was kind of sickly...

Okay, fine. Look, look,
I'm calling her now! See?!

Thank you.

So anyway,
Howard asked Penny

to talk to Bernadette,
and she did,

and Bernadette agreed to meet
him for a cup of coffee.

One question.
Yeah?

Why on earth
are you telling me all this?

I don't know.

Sometimes your movements
are so lifelike,

I forget you're
not a real boy.

You said I could
buy a desk.

This isn't a <i>desk.</i>

This is a...
Brobdingnagian
monstrosity.

Is that the American idiom

for "giant, big-ass desk"?

It's actually British.

Can you say it again for me?

Brobdingnagian.

One more time?

Brobdingnagian.

Now three times fast?

Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna...

How did you even
get it in here?

That's for me, Ramon, Julio,
Jesus and Rodrigo to know

and you to find out.

All right, you've
made your point.

A fine prank, very amusing.

Now get it out.

No.

Yes.

Yes.
No.

Yes!
I have three brothers

and two sisters, Sheldon--
I can do this all day.

All right, if you're
not going to remove it,

I'll remove it for you.

Knock yourself out.

Help me move my desk.

No.
Yes.

No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

Why do you even want this here?

Its size is completely
disproportionate
to its purpose.

Well, seeing as its purpose
was to piss you off,

I'd say it's spot-on.

All right, I see
what's going on.

This is the opening
salvo in what will be

an escalating series of
juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

Well titted.

Thank you.

Stand by for my upcoming tat.

Hey, Sheldon?

Yes?

No.

See what I did there?
I turned it around.

Sorry,

I had to clock out.

Oh, no, that's okay.

How have you been?

Okay. You know,
busy, schoolwork. You?

Same. I took a scuba-diving
course over the summer,

but it turns out I'm
terrified of the ocean.

Too bad.

You wouldn't know anybody
who wants to buy a wet
suit, boy's large?

Yeah, forget it.
Not important.

So, are you
seeing anyone?

Well, to be honest, I...
Hey, how are we

doing over here? Can I
get you something to drink?

Not for me, thanks.
I'm okay.

Are you gonna want
to order food?

Maybe later.
Okay.

So, are you seeing anybody?

No.

That's what I told him
when he asked me.

I hope that's not out of line.

No, it's fine.
Penny, can we have
a little privacy?

Oh. I'm sorry.

What about you,
have you been seeing anybody?

Well, you know
how it is with guys.

I mean, we have needs and...

So you've been seeing
other girls?

Well, not real girls.

Does that mean slutty trolls?

You know, you look thirsty.

I brought you some iced tea.
Thank you.

It's passion fruit,
new on the menu.

I know. I work here.
Oh, sorry.

Yeah, you're right. Doy.

So, Howard,

yay or nay?

Isn't there somewhere else
you can be?

Not where I can hear you guys.

Okay, fine.

I'll admit, there are dark,
sordid little corners

of the Internet
where the name Wolowizard

is whispered in hushed tones.

The only reason I go there,

the only reason
I've ever gone there

is because I don't have
a real woman in my life.

You happy?
Yeah, that'll hold me
for a while.

Howard, you did have
a real woman.

I was right there
in the next room

while you were clicking
that troll's brains out.

Yeah, but we
weren't...

I-I mean, you
and I never...

Had sex?

Yeah.

Well, whose fault was that?

Complimentary nachos!

You enjoy.

Never had sex? Wow.

What do you mean,
whose fault was that?

Well, we could've
been having sex,

but you never made the move.

I didn't think you wanted me
to make the move.

Howard, a girl doesn't go out
with a man like you,

with your looks,
your fancy patter

and your tight hoochie pants
if she's not expecting him

to eventually make the move.

Really?

Really.

Son of a bitch.

Hey, this is a little awkward,
but my manager says

I can't actually
give nachos away.

So... just take that
when you're ready.

Yeah, we had
a really great talk,

and we're gonna start
seeing each other again.

Oh, congratulations.

Have you broken it
to the troll yet?

Did Penny tell you about that?

No. Steve Patterson told me.

The greasy old fat guy
in Facilities Management?

Yeah.
How'd he know about it?

He's Glissinda the troll.

Sorry, dude,

the thermostat's
on my side of the room,

so it stays Mumbai hot
in here until you turn off
that stupid Indian music!

I'll turn off the music

when you get rid of that
salmonella-ridden parakeet!

Oh, too bad! Sheldon's
pathologically
afraid of birds!

Hey, look, Sheldon!
Birdie, birdie, birdie!

That's it! Prepare
for marshmallow death!

Eat flaming Nerf!

So anyway...

That's great news
about you and Bernadette.

Yeah. I think I'm gonna take
her to miniature golf.

Ah. Well, I guess

for you guys that's
like regular golf.

Short jokes? Really?
You're, like,

a quarter of an inch
taller than me.

Yeah, and don't
you forget it.

I had a good time.

Me, too.

Kiss her good night.

All right, now a little tongue.

GEORGE TAKEI:
Hold on there.

We've only just rekindled
the romance.

Let's not sully the moment
with the exchange of saliva.

Don't listen to him.

She wants it.

Tongue.

La, la, la, la, la.

See?

Now make the move.

Mm-mmm.
Too soon.

Trust me, she's ready.

Make the move.

No, no, no.

A lady wants to be wooed,

courted slowly.

How would <i>you</i> know?

I read.

Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

Make the move, now.

Mm! What are you doing?

You said... well,
the "move," remember?

Oh, not <i>now.</i>

We're starting a
new relationship.

I need to get to
know you again.

No, you don't.

It's <i>me.</i>

The lusty charmer
with the fancy patter

and the hoochie pants.

Be patient;
we'll get there.

Told you.

Oh, God, what's that smell?

Oh-ho-hoo!

Yes?

What are you
doing in there?

I'm making
hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia gas.

Just a little experiment
in pest control.

It's not gonna work, dude;
I grew up in India--

an entire subcontinent
where cows walk in the street,

and nobody has ever had
a solid bowel movement.

Well, we'll just see
how long you can hold out.

Well, we'll just see how

your noxious gas fares
against my cinnamon-

apple-scented
aroma therapy candles.

Didn't you say you're
making hydrogen sulfide gas?

Yes.
Isn't that flammable?

Highly.

Oh, dear.

This is not over.

All I'm saying is, if they
took all the money they spent

trying to make
a decent Hulk movie,

they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.

That is apt and amusing.

I think I shall share that

with Amy Farrah Fowler.

She'll appreciate
the witticism.

Thank you.

It'll also help improve her
initial impression of you.

So what's going on with you two?

Well, the status is
as it always was.

She's a girl. She's a friend.

She is not my--

please forgive me
for doing this--

"girlfriend."

Right, right.

So you're still just
texting and emailing?

You don't feel any need
to hang out with her, you know--

be in the same room?

Leonard, you are
my best friend.

I've known you
for seven years,

and I can barely tolerate
sitting on the couch with you.

Imagine my attitude regarding
prolonged physical proximity

to Amy Farrah Fowler.

Got it.

I sense judgment on your part.

No, no.

Maybe a little.

May I suggest that your
criticism is based on jealousy.

Jealousy? What do I
have to be jealous of?

I have a functioning
and satisfying relationship

with a female.

You have none.

Oh, right. That.

Jealousy is an ugly
green-eyed monster--

not unlike the Hulk--

who, by the way,
also has a girlfriend.

In this iteration,
Jennifer Connelly,

whom you may recall as
the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

in <i>A Beautiful Mind,</i>

a feel-good romp if
there ever was one.

I'm not jealous.

Leonard not jealous.

You know, it just
occurred to me,

if there are an infinite
number of parallel universes,

in one of them,
there's probably a Sheldon

who doesn't believe
parallel universes exist.

Probably. What's your point?

No point.

It's just one
of the things

that makes one of
the mes chuckle.

What makes you
chuckle, Leonard?

Hmm, recently?

Not much.

Is it because of the
conflict that arises

from your desperate need
to pair-bond with a woman,

and the apparent collective
decision of all womankind

to deny you
that opportunity?

Um...

Shut up.

You know,
when my grandfather died,

and Meemaw was alone,
my mom arranged for her

to visit a center
three times a week

where she could socialize
with other lonely people.

It's very nice.

They discuss current events,
play bridge, get a hot meal.

That sounds lovely.

It is if you
like bridge.

Do you like bridge,
Leonard?

Sheldon, I'm just not
dating someone right now.

I don't need to go
to a senior center.

Meemaw resisted at first,
but now she loves it.

Fine. If I don't meet someone
soon, you can put me in a home.

It's not a home.

It's a senior center.

We'd never put
Meemaw in a home!

Hey, guys.

Hey.
Hey.

All right, I'll bow
to social pressure: Hey!

Excuse me. That's my girlfriend,
Bernadette.

I assigned her
her own ringtone--

"Bernadette,"
by The Four Tops.

Hello, Bernadette.

When I call him, his phone
plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

Which, now that

I think about it,
is not so good.

You realize he's just
rubbing our noses in the fact

that he has a girlfriend,
and we don't.

You mean, <i>you</i> don't.

You have a girlfriend?

How could you have a girlfriend?

You can't even speak to women.

Two words-- deaf chick.

It doesn't matter

if I can't talk,
because she can't hear me.

What?

That's what she said.

Great. You have a girlfriend,
Howard's got a girlfriend,

Sheldon's got
a girl...
No, no, no, no!

...who's a friend.

Thank you.

What about you, Stuart?

You have a
girlfriend yet?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I met her at Comic-Con,
the one place in the world

where saying
"I own a comic bookstore"

is an actual pickup line.

Oh. Well, good for you.

Not really. She's horrible.

When she wants to have sex,

she puts on her plus-size
Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

"Who wants to take a ride
in my invisible plane?"

Why don't you just
break up with her?

No, no, I can't.

Why not?

'Cause then I'd be alone,

like you.

Dude, why don't you just invoke
your girlfriend pact

with Wolowitz?

Because I don't
need his girlfriend

to set me up with one
of her girlfriends.

I'm perfectly capable of
finding a girl on my own.

Oh, Leonard, you remind me

of the funny old story
about a man

who walks into a women's
correctional institution

with a stack of paperwork

that will allow
the female convicts to go free.

You're saying I
couldn't get laid

in a women's prison with
a handful of pardons.

Are you going to let me
tell the story or not?

Leonard?

Are you sleeping?

No.

Are you ill?

No.

Are you still depressed

because you're alone,
and no one loves you?

I don't know. Maybe.

I want you to know
that I'm genuinely concerned

about your well-being.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

But it's still no reason
to have your feet in my spot.

May I offer an observation?

What the hell?
How long has she been here?

Since we got home
from the comic bookstore.

That was two hours ago.

As per your suggestion,

we're hanging out.

Quite frankly, I don't see

what all the hoopla's about.

Go on, Amy.

From a neurobiological
standpoint, Leonard,

you may be alone
because your psychological state

is causing
an actual pheromone-based stink

of desperation.

Did you know that, Leonard?

No.
I did.

Leonard, I understand
that some people find mates

in social gathering places
such as bars or taverns.

Have you tried a bar or tavern?

No, I'm not gonna try
to pick up a woman in a bar.

Wise decision. You see, Amy,

success at a bar is based
on classic male attributes

such as height, strength,
attractiveness,

the ability to hold one's liquor
and throw darts--

separately or together.

Leonard has none of these
attributes, right, Leonard?

Right.

That's not true of all bars.

Juice bars, for example.

Oh! Good point, Amy.

Yeah, building
on your premise,

Leonard could
frequent sushi bars,

salad bars, oyster bars,

the Apple Genius Bar...
What are you doing?

Keep going. I'm listening.

That was rude.

He does it all the time.

He's a cornucopia
of social awkwardness.

Cornucopia.

What a mellifluous word.

Let's make that our word
of the day.

Agreed. And we'll use
mellifluous tomorrow.

Well, I have to void my bladder.

It was nice spending this time
with you.

Wait.

I have a request.

Yes?

I'd like you to meet my mother.

I see.

Can I get back to you on that?

Certainly. Good night.

Good night.

Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard,

Leonard, Leonard...

Yeah, what?

Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me
to meet her mother.

Yeah. So?

What does that mean?

Well, you know
how you're always saying

that Amy is a girl
who's your friend,

and not your girlfriend?

Uh-huh.
You can't say
that anymore.

Wait. What?

Look, she obviously wants

to take your relationship
to the next level.

I don't want
the next level.

I like this level.

Fix it for me!

Me?

Well, how am I supposed
to fix it?

Simple! You want a girlfriend,

Amy wants
to be someone's girlfriend.

Take her off my hands.
I give you my blessing.

That is insane.

You're right.
It would never work.

Amy finds you tedious.

Okay, good luck.

Wait! What am I
supposed to do?

Well, have you considered
telling her how you feel?

Leonard, I'm a physicist,
not a hippie.

All right, well, let me see

if I can explain your situation
using physics.

What would you be

if you were attached
to another object

by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis?

Screwed.

There you go.

Amy's right.

He is tedious.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, get the door!

Why can't you get it?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse

for my colonoscopy!

I'm like an upside-down
volcano here.

Oh, hey.

I hope you didn't hear that.

The volcano thing? No.

What's with the T-shirt?

You working at the
Apple store now?

No, it's just something
I threw on.

I know all your shirts.

That's not one of them...

You were pretending to
work at the Genius Bar

to pick up women,
weren't you?

Yeah.

Turns out,
they guard the iPods,

but they don't
guard the shirts.

So, how'd it go?

It was going well.

I was showing
this super hot girl

how to boot up in Safe Mode.

The manager got suspicious,
and, well, long story short,

they really do have
a little jail in the mall.

Just FYI, don't try to go
back with a fake mustache.

I mean, they may not
really be geniuses,

but they see
right through that.

I want to invoke
the girlfriend pact, Howard.

You that desperate?

No, I just...
I want what you have.

You know, I want
a woman in my life.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Holy Moses,

how much liquid can
be in one tokus?

To be clear, I meant like
Bernadette, not your mother.

Yeah, I know
what you mean.

Well, I'm off to meet
Bernadette's friend.

How do I look?

As if one of the plants

from
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>

duplicated you in every way,

only with an absurd
amount of hair gel.

What are you
working on?

I'm removing
my digital footprint

from the Internet

so Amy Farrah Fowler
can't find me

and compel me to meet her mother.
Ah.

You're going off the grid.

Exactly.

The old Unabomber approach.
Kudos.

Thank you.

I've also sent Amy a
relationship termination notice

and changed my cell phone number
and e-mail address.

What if she just comes over?

She'll get lost.

We no longer live
at 2311 Los Robles.

We now live at 311 Los Robles.

You changed the address
on the building?

What about mail?

Oh, no worries--
I explained my predicament

to our letter carrier.

He was sympathetic.

His exact words were:

"Got your back, Jack.

Bitches be crazy."

Who is it?

Amy Farrah Fowler.

Darn! She found me!

She's been here before.

The only flaw in an
otherwise perfect plan.

Now, get my back, Jack.

What do you want to do?
Tell her I'm not here.

Okay, where are you?
I don't know.

You'll have to devise a scenario

that plausibly
explains my absence,

keeping in mind that the key to
a good lie lies in the details.

Hi, Amy.

Sheldon's not here.

All right.

Way to go on the details.

Thanks again for
doing this, Bernadette.

Oh, I take pacts
very seriously.

One time at my lab,
a petri dish

of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.

That day we made a pinky swear
never to admit

we crossed Ebola
with the common cold.

Why the hell

would you cross Ebola
with the common cold?

We never did.

That would be
a terrible, terrible thing.

Hi. Sorry I'm late--
I was at the gym.

Spin class--
worked up quite a sweat.

Joy, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is Joy.

Hi.
Hi.

You don't look
like a genius.

Go ahead, say
something smart.

Uh...
Aah! Time's up.

Just kidding.

First thing you need
to know about me:

I'm hilarious.

Yeah.

So, Bernadette tells me

she knows you from
self-defense classes?

Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.

Lots of fun.

Basically,
a hundred different ways

to rip a guy's nuts off.

Wow. Wouldn't think there'd

be that many.
Number 42!

Whoa!

Isn't she a pip?

Proxima Centauri's
the nearest star.

The celestial bodies
that follow are

Alpha Centauri A, Toli,

Barnard's Star,

Wolf 359...

Lalande 21185,

Sirius A, Sirius B,

BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti,

Ross 154...

Ross 248...

Epsilon Eridani,

Lac-9352,

Ross 128,

Procyon A...

Oh, darn, that's wrong!

EZ Aquarii A,

EZ Aquarii B,

EZ Aquarii C,

Procyon A.

Those are the stars
that are nearest to me.

Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

Oh, dear.

They really do be crazy.

This lobster's good
on the way down

and the way up.

Should be-- it's
$30 a pound.

Hey, this is a date, right?

Yep, it is.

73!
Whoa!

Excuse me, I have to go
to the little girls' room...

and take a wicked whiz.

I'll go with you.

Fair warning--
I had the asparagus.

My pee is gonna
stink up the place.

I think she likes you.

EZ Aquarii B...

EZ Aquarii C...

Excuse me, madam.

Sheldon?

Rats!

I believe a misunderstanding
may have occurred

when I asked you
to meet my mother.

No misunderstanding.

I've learned what that
request actually means,

and I don't want to be
joined to another object

by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis.

In what way are
you screwed?

All I want to do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother

so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.

So we'd be
perpetrating a ruse?

Precisely.

And you haven't fallen
hopelessly in love with me?

Don't be absurd.

I find the notion
of romantic love

to be an unnecessary
cultural construct

that adds no value to
human relationships.

Amy Farrah Fowler, that's
the most pragmatic thing

anyone has ever said to me.

I trust this clarification
allows us to return

to boy-slash-friend-slash-
girl-slash-friend status.

Of course.

Would you like to join me
for Chinese food?

Sheldon, please,
you're suffocating me.

My apologies.

Good night, Amy.
Good night, Sheldon.

Come on, just
give her a chance.

Maybe she'll grow on you.

Or maybe she'll finally succeed in
ripping my nuts off.

There are still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

Look, H-Howard,
I appreciate

the effort, but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

Seriously?

I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on J-Date,

and that didn't
even crack my top ten.

I guess the difference is,
I have some self-respect.

Not that I've ever seen.

It's relatively new.

I just know that

I'm not gonna spend time
with someone I don't like

simply to have a girlfriend.

I'm okay on my own.

Good news-- I made
lots of room for dessert.

Look, uh, Joy, it was nice
to meet you, but...

Yeah, you, too.
Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

I need a date for
my cousin's wedding.

You're asking me out?

Yeah.

And it's an open bar,

so I'll probably
be giving it away.

I look forward to it.

MRS. FOWLER
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

I honestly didn't believe Amy

when she told me
she had a boyfriend.

I assure you I am quite real

and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

What?

Oh, yes.

We're like wild
animals in heat.

It's a wonder neither
of us has been hurt.

Amy... what is he saying?

You wanted me to have
a boyfriend, Mother.

Well, here he is.

Have to sign off now.

My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

Oh, yes, it's time
for me to make love

to your daughter's vagina.

Thank you, Sheldon,
that went very well.

Agreed.

Amy, I find
myself wondering

if we should actually
engage in coitus

at least one time
in our relationship.

Bazinga.

Bedtime. Please
show yourself out.

Problem?

This is the worst cobbler
I've ever eaten.

It tastes like it's made of
actual ground-up shoemaker.

Amusing. A play on the
two meanings of "cobbler."

Hey, guys. Guess who
I found at LAX?

My baby sister Priya.

Excuse me, I object.

You propose a guessing game,

yet you don't give me
enough time to guess.

For the record,
I was going to say:

"Your sister Priya."

Oh, Sheldon. You haven't
changed a bit, have you?

Why would I change?

The hope has been that

you'd eventually bend
to public opinion.

So, Priya, what brings
you back to L.A.?

I have a one-day layover
on my way to Toronto.

Corporate merger.

Can you believe it?

Little Priya's one
of the lead attorneys

for the biggest
car company in India.

Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school

and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company,

it's actually
extremely plausible.

And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

I want to catch up
with all of you,

but first I really
must visit the loo.

I'm going, too; I'll
show you where it is.

All right, this goes
without saying,

but I'm just going
to say it anyway.

Hands off my sister.

Why would I touch her? She's
covered with airplane germs.

I'm so not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.
Oh, please.

My sister's much hotter

than your girlfriend,
and you know it.

Let's just agree
they're both hot.

But dude, that's my sister
you're talking about!

Okay, forget who's hotter.

The first time Priya came to
L.A., Leonard and I made a pact

out of respect to our
friendship and to you

that neither of us
would hit on her.

Did you pinky-swear?

Yes.

Okay, then.

Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

Yeah. It's good
to see you, too.

Here you go.

Thanks.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Okay.

âª Our whole universe

So you got any special plans
with your sister?

Oh, not really. Just hang out.

I always tell people,
"If you have only one day

in Los Angeles,
make it a train day."

Train day?

The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City,

a hotdog stand in a
converted railroad dining car.

Next stop, Travel Town,

an outdoor museum featuring
43 railroad engines,

cars, and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

And, finally, we're off to the
glitz and glamour of Hollywood,

for dinner at--that's right--
the Hollywood Carney's,

a hotdog stand in a <i>different</i>
converted railroad dining car.

I don't think
we're going to do that.

Well, then apparently
you hate fun.

Priya's not back yet?

Well, I guess
that's not unusual.

Women, men, the whole
sitting-standing deal.

So what are we talking about?

Uh, my plans
with Priya.

He rejected Train Day.

Did you make it clear that
it's two different train cars

turned into hotdog stands?

Abundantly.

I guess he just hates fun.

That's what I said!

Okay, so... what's
new with you guys?

I have a girlfriend now.

Hey, good for you!

Yeah, I just want
to put it out there

in case I inadvertently

squirt any pheromones
in your direction.

Happy?

So, Priya, what are your
plans while you're here?

I don't know. I just
have the one day.

Do you like trains?

Not particularly.

You might as well just wait
at the airport for your flight.

"You are in a forest.

"There is quicksand to the west,

a path leads to the east."

Go east.

"An iron gate blocks your way."

Open gate.

"It's locked."

Hmm.

Well, so much for that.

It's getting pretty late.
How come you're still up?

I found an emulator online that
lets you play classic text-based

computer games from the 1980s.

That's pretty cool.

Oh, yes. It runs on the world's
most powerful graphics chip:

imagination.

You've really got
to get out more.

Go north.

"You can't go that way."

Go west.

"A troll blocks your passage."

Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

Kill troll.

"With what?"

With sword.

"You don't have the sword."

Good golly, it's as if
it's actually happening to me.

Raj finally went to bed.

Sheldon's still up.

You said he goes
to bed at 9:00.

Yeah, he does, but he got caught
up in a computer game and...

Hit troll with axe!

My, this is one tough troll.

Can't you get rid of him?

If the past is any
indication, no.

Leonard, I'm trapped
in quicksand!

The axe is dragging me down!

Drop axe!

Drop axe, brilliant!

Give me a minute.

Sheldon.

Hold on.

Trying to figure out

how to get the bucket,

so I can carry the mud
past the dragon.

Sheldon, you need to
work in the morning.

I know!

Well, then bed, mister!

Five more minutes!

Really?

You're going to risk getting
sleepy in the middle of your

thermodynamic
fluctuations seminar?

You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

Everyone will see
my oddly shaped uvula.

You don't want that, do you?

No.

But it's a shame our society
mocks the differently uvulated.

Who was at the door?

Uh, building manager.

They have to fix a pipe,

so the water'll be off
tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

That's unacceptable.

We're supposed to be
given written notice.

Well, no, it doesn't matter--
we'll be at work.

What if I spill tomato
soup on my shirt,

and have to come home to change,

only to find there's no water
for an enzyme soak?

Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!

I'll have the chicken noodle.
Good night!

We're going
to have to be very quiet.

I know how to
get the bucket!

I can turn the axe around

and use the handle to reach it.

Let's see.

Go north.

"You are in a forest."

Go north.

"You are in a forest."

Go north.

"You are in a forest."
Oh dear, I believe I'm lost.

Well, I'll just have to get
a fresh start tomorrow.

No, no, no! You just
took a wrong turn.

You just need to map it out.

Come on, I'll help you.

So you stopped at the stream,

and you turned
north three times?

Yes.

You're right.
You're lost. Good luck.

Oh!

Leonard. Wake up.

Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

For what?

I don't know. When I'm in bed
with a girl, it's just--

it's my go-to response.

It's 6:00. I have
to get back to Raj's

before he wakes up
and realizes I'm gone.

Oh. Right. Sure.

I wish you could stay
in L.A. a while longer.

Mmm, me, too.

You know, I was thinking:

There are some great
research facilities in India.

Where are you going
with this, Leonard?

Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I don't have any real ties here,

so if I were to move to New
Delhi, we could, you know--

go out.

Leonard, didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

Well, yes, but...

things have changed.

You know, you're older,
I'm older--

Look, no more
superhero bed sheets.

Sweetheart,

just because we have fun when
I come to town doesn't mean

I want to have a
serious relationship.

It doesn't?

Mm-mm.

And besides, I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

They'd have a cow.

Which is a much
bigger deal in India.

I'm not that white.

My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

I know that's not the right kind
of Indian, but it is something.

You're funny.

Leonard?

What?

I heard a woman laughing.

Oh, uh, yeah. I was trying to
see if I could laugh as a woman.

Oh! Well, good job.
Quite convincing.

I smell perfume.

Air freshener.

And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

Rash. That's a bad rash.

My sympathies.

I'm no stranger to the crimson
scourge that is dermatitis.

Can I interest you
in a topical steroid

from my lotion and
unguent collection?

Uh, yeah, yeah,
that sounds great.

Very well. I'm sure
I can find something

that will help
you ditch that itch.

Okay, he's in the
bathroom. Let's go.

Do you prefer
ointment or cream?

Cream.

With or without a numbing agent?

Without.

Really, Leonard?

There are no heroes when
it comes to dermatitis.

Fine. With.

Prescription or
non-prescription strength?

Use your best judgment.

Well, I think I have a
nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

It's usually indicated for
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,

but it also goes nicely
with non-mucosal body parts.

Sounds great.

Excellent choice.

Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

Come on, come on, come on.

Priya?

Good morning, Sheldon.

For shame, Leonard, for shame.

And to think,

I was ready to waste

the last of my good
hemorrhoid cream on you.

Making pretty
good time, huh?

Is that really what you want
to talk about, Leonard?

No.

What do you want to talk about?

Please don't tell anyone

I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

There it is.

What if someone asks?

No one's going to ask if I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

Perhaps, but they might ask me
something else.

Like what?
Like

"Has Leonard betrayed any
of his friends recently?"

Priya and I are both adults.

I didn't betray Raj.

In fact, you did,
but I was referring to Howard.

What are you talking about?

April 12, 2005.

Bob's Big Boy,
Toluca Lake.

Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time.

She was enjoying the sweet taste
of Hindu rebellion

in the form of a Bob's
Super Big Boy hamburger.

In order
to preserve

your friendship, you and Howard
made a pinky swear

that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

I had a patty melt.

Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

And Raj.
All right, and Raj.

And me.

You?

Violation of the
Roommate Agreement's

overnight guest
notification clause.

Okay, fine,
I-I'm a horrible human being.

I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

You're far too short
to be Darth Vader.

At best you might be
a turncoat Ewok.

My point is: Priya's gone
and it would be much better

if no one else found out
about us.

You mean you want me
to keep a secret?

Yes.

You know I can't
keep a secret.

You can if you try.

Think about
it this way:

um, if I were Batman
and you were Alfred,

you'd keep that
secret, right?

Why do you get
to be Batman?

Because Batman has the secret.

Alfred has secrets, too.

Like what?
Alfred knows

that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

Which I've now just
told to Batman.

See, I cannot
keep a secret.

Ta-dah!

What?

Ta-dah.

It's short for...

âª Da-da-da-da! âª

Kind of busy here, Sheldon.

I know,
that's why I shortened it.

What do you want?

I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

What alibi?

You've asked me

to lie on your behalf,
and as you know,

I am deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty,

so I've provided you

with an ironclad alibi.

You couldn't have spent
last night with Priya

because you were
with another woman.

Oh, I'm so sure
I'm gonna regret this,

but who was I with?

The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

Oh, God.

You met her at Pasadena's most
popular Irish watering hole,

Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie
spends her nights tending bar

with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

"Leonard, call me if you
are interested in coitus.

Sincerely,
Maggie McGarry."

And if anyone were

to actually call that number,
they will hear this.

FEMALE TEXT-TO-SPEECH VOICE:
Top of the morning to you.

You've reached Maggie McGarry.

Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

It's pretty convincing, huh?

That wasn't even
a real person.

And here is
the clincher:

a lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

Where'd you get that?

From an orangutan
in the primate lab.

An orangutan?

Well, no one's going

to run a DNA test
on it, Leonard.

Honestly, you overthink
everything.

Sheldon, I don't need an alibi.

Nobody's going to ask
about last night

as long as you just
zip your lip.

Thank you.

Now, don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.

Hey.

Hey, Leonard, will you
please tell Howard

my sister has never
been attracted to him?

Come on, Raj,

how am I supposed to know

who she is attracted to
or was attracted to

or who she might be
attracted to in the future?

And I have nothing
to contribute

to this conversation.

Because I, too,
know absolutely nothing

about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

And with that,
I will re-zip my lip.

Hey, so what did
you guys think

of the new episode
of <i>Caprica</i> last night?

I didn't see it.

Didn't see it?

What were you doing?

Uh, I was out.

What, on <i>Caprica</i> night?

Yeah, I, uh, went
for a drink.

Really, you?

Where, w-where'd
you go?

To, uh...

Lucky Baldwin's.

Oh, I've heard
of that place.

Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

Yes.

Did you meet

anyone interesting there,

perhaps a promiscuous,
redheaded barmaid?

As a matter of fact...
I-I-I-I-I can't, I can't,

I can't do it.

Sure you can, you're doing
fine, it's very believable.

I'm sorry, Raj,
but the truth is,

I was with Priya
last night.

Don't listen to him.

He's still light-headed
from all the Irish whiskey

and pickled eggs
in his system.

What were you doing
with Priya?

I believe they engaged
in coitus,

but more
importantly,

if Leonard had not abandoned
his story,

would you have found it
plausible?

You slept with my sister?!

Yeah.

How could you?
We had a pact.

Excuse me, I think
"How could you? She's my sister"

takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinky swear.

May I point out,

in a parallel universe,
your friends are saying

"Maggie McGarry--
she sounds lovely."

Look, I-I admit it, I may
have crossed a line here,

but come on, Raj, your
sister is a grown woman,

and to her, I'm a forbidden
piece of white chocolate.

I don't believe it.

This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust.

No, w-w-would it
help if I told you

that I offered her my heart,
and she kind of stomped on it?

How hard did she stomp?

Very hard.

Okay, I'm good.

Well, Raj,

I just want to say that I'd
never betray your trust.

Unlike Leonard,
I respect you.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj

about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

Dude, I put that thing
on my face!

I think a more amusing
violation of Raj's trust

is when Howard convinced him
that foreigners give presents

to Americans
on Thanksgiving.

Hey, I didn't see
you giving back

your Snoopy
snow cone maker.

That was all a lie?

This year's gifts
are already wrapped.

And as long as we're talking
about betraying our friends,

how about the month Sheldon
spent grinding up insects

and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

Well, excuse me.

That was not a betrayal.

That was an experiment
to determine

at what concentration
food starts tasting "mothy."

You put moths in my food?!

For science.

I can't believe you kissed
my sister with moth mouth.

Well, I can't believe you
used Sheldon's toothbrush.

You used my toothbrush?

Not the brush part,
just the little rubber thing

to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

Okay, I-I think
it's safe to say

that we've all done
some things

we're not
particularly proud of.

But come on,
we're friends.

Friends overlook
each other's minor lapses.

For the record, Howard, I'm
sorry that I broke our pact.

Thank you.

And I'm sorry
about your phone

and Thanksgiving.

And while we're at it,

you don't have to wash our
clothes on the Fourth of July.

As long as we're apologizing,

Sheldon, I'm, I'm sorry
I used your toothbrush.

And I'm sorry...

but that behavior
is beyond the pale

and cannot be tolerated.

We are no longer friends.

I got you a talking Thomas the
Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

With real puffing smoke?

Yes.

All right.

But I'm watching you.

Hey, you've got Snoopy out.

Can I have a snow cone?

Well, sure.

This is pretty good.

What flavor is this?

Guess.

Papaya?
No.

Guava?
You're so close.

I give up.

Mango caterpillar.

What are
you doing?!

You said you
liked it.

No, seriously,
I think

I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

The capybara is the largest
member of the rodent family.

What does that have to do
with me and women?

Nothing.
It was a desperate attempt

to introduce an alternate topic
of conversation.

My problem is,
I don't project confidence.

So I decided that
the next time I meet a woman

I think is attractive,
rather than holding back

and being cautious,
I'm going to assume

the mantle of self-assurance.

Oh, yeah?
What's that look like?

Hi.

I'm Leonard.

And you are beautiful.

You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

show you a night
you will never forget.

Where are we going?

Good news.

I made it
onto the team

for the new Defense Department

laser-equipped
surveillance satellite.

Excuse me.

If we're changing topics,
I believe I have first dibs

with capybara, a rodent
the size of a baby hippo.

Congratulations,
Howard.

Thanks.

Listen, I have to get
a security clearance,

so you guys might be
hearing from the FBI.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I don't want to speak
to the FBI.

Why not?

I'm brown and I talk funny.

They're just doing
a background check on me.

It doesn't matter;
they'll find a reason

to give me a one-way ticket
back to Gandhi-ville.

By the way,

when I say that,
it's not offensive.

Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

You're here legally.

Nobody cares.
Do you know how long it's been

since I got through
airport security

without being given
a colonoscopy?

You know, I
try very hard

to make our lunch hours
educational and informative,

but your insistence on
talking about your own lives

stymies me at
every turn.

Fine, Sheldon, tell us
about your giant rodents.

1No, you squandered
your time with me,

and the moment
has now passed.

Feast on your disappointment,

much as the capybara
feasts on its own waste.

âª Our whole universe

Oh, Bella, don't you see?

Edward's only pushing you away
because he loves you.

Coming.

Dr. Koothrappali?

I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

May I come in?

I'd like to talk to you
about Howard Wolowitz.

Oh, thank you.

All right.

Well, how long
have you known Mr. Wolowitz?

Rum cake?

No, thanks.

Now, about Mr.
Wolowitz...

Seven years.

I see.

I'm in this country
legally, you know.

I'm sure you are.

Now, to your knowledge, has Mr.
Wolowitz ever committed a crime?

Of course not.

I'm here on an H-1B visa,

which means I can't be
associated in any way

with crime
or criminal activity.

And I'm not.

Good.

To your knowledge,
does Mr. Wolowitz

have any foreign
contacts?

No, just me.

Oh, there it is.

Here comes a cavity search.

Excuse me?

Please don't send me back
to India; it's so crowded!

It's like the whole country
is one endless Comic-Con,

except everybody's wearing
the same costume: Indian Guy.

Dr. Koothrappali, I'm not...
I love this country!

The-the baseball,
the freedom,

the rampant morbid obesity!

From California
to the New York Island!

I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!

Dr. Koothrappali,
please.

âª My country 'tis of thee... âª

âª ...liberty âª

âª It's really great. âª

So, when Howard said the FBI
would be contacting me,

I was expecting Mulder.

Glad to see I got Scully.

Who?

Mulder and Scully.

<i>X-Files.</i>

"The truth is out there."

Never mind.

Uh, so, what would you
like to know?

You work with Mr. Wolowitz here
at the university, correct?

Yes. Of course, we're in
different departments.

He's an engineer and I'm
an experimental physicist.

You know, one
of those guys

who examines the building blocks
of creation

and says,
"Hello, maker of the universe.

"I see what you did there.

Good one."

Right.

Now, how would you characterize

your relationship
with Mr. Wolowitz?

Good.

It's a good
relationship.

Of course, most of my
relationships are good.

Probably because
I exude confidence.

People are drawn to that,
you know?

Confidence, not exuding.

Do you know of any groups
Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

You are beautiful,

you know that?

You pop, sparkle
and buzz electric.

I'm going to pick you up
at 8:00,

show you a night
you will never forget.

Sounds great.

Really?

Yeah.

Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL
husband come with us?

Is that...?

Oh, my, I didn't see the ring
with my glasses off, so...

Look at that,
I'm starting to exude.

Want to get that?

Not particularly.

Could you get that?

I suppose I could
if I were asked.

Would you please get that?

Of course.

Why do you have to make things
so complicated?

Dr. Cooper?

Yes.

I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

You <i>say</i> you're Special
Agent Page, FBI.

Here's my I.D.

And here is

my Justice League
membership card.

But that doesn't
prove I know Batman.

I just want to ask you a few
questions about Howard Wolowitz.

Oh. All right.

I doubt anyone
would risk

the stiff penalties for
impersonating a federal officer

just to ask questions about
a minor league engineer

with an unresolved
Oedipal complex.

Thank you.

For the record,
I truly support the FBI

in the mission
which is expressed

through their motto...?

Fidelity, bravery, integrity.

Correct. Now to business.

18 years ago, I sent
the FBI Crime Lab samples

from a bag of excrement
that had been lit on fire

on my front porch...

...for fingerprinting
and DNA analysis.

Why haven't I heard back yet?

Well, the FBI Crime Lab
does have a lot on its plate.

That's of little comfort
to a nation

attempting to scrape
burning feces off its shoes.

Would you mind if we talked
about Mr. Wolowitz now?

A little, but go on.

Thank you.

Would you characterize him
as responsible?

I'm going to answer that
with a visual aid.

This is my nine-disc complete

<i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy
Blu-ray set.

Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it,

damaged plastic retention
hub number three...

...and then returned it to me,
hoping I wouldn't notice.

Would you characterize that
as responsible?

That's really not the sort of
thing we're interested in.

You heard me say
Blu-ray, right?

I did.

Very well.

Would you be interested

in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz
once snuck onto

my World of Warcraft account
and changed the name

of a certain level-80 warlock
from Sheldor to Smeldor?

I'm afraid not.

Is there anything else?

"Is there anything else?"

Where would you like to start?

He refuses to pay fines

when he's overdue
with books I lend him.

He crashed the Mars Rover while
attempting to impress a woman.

He recommended that I go see

the third <i>Matrix</i> movie
because it was, and I quote,

"just as good
as the first one."

If that's not irresponsible,
I don't know what is.

The Mars Rover?

Did I say Mars Rover?

You did.

That was actually
a poorly chosen example,

as it had nothing
to do with me.

Yes, well, let's talk
about it anyway.

I don't want to.

Not that my disinclination

to discuss the topic
should be interpreted as

evidence of Howard Wolowitz's
culpability in the destruction

of government property
worth millions of dollars.

Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

I think I have all I need.

Oh, good.

I was afraid you were
going to fixate

on that Mars Rover incident.

Hey, buddies.

Guess who didn't get
security clearance

to work on
the giant space laser?

What happened?

Apparently, the background
interviews didn't go well.

You guys wouldn't
know anything

about that, would you?

Well, actually,
I may have gotten

a little tipsy
when I talked to her.

And I may have

hit on her a little bit.

I may have thrown up
rum cake on her shoes.

I see.

Well, it's good to know, when
I need you guys, I can always

count on you to step up
and ruin everything.

I feel awful.

Ah, me, too.

To tell you the truth,

I thought if anyone was going to

screw things up for Howard,
it'd be Sheldon.

Well, your expectations
have been subverted.

Aha.

What are you doing up?

Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

Really?

Maybe sleep has met you before.

Mockery?

That's all you have to offer?

I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?

Who knows?

I haven't watched
any scary movies recently.

I'm no longer obsessing
over why the predicted mass

of the quantum vacuum
has little effect

on the expansion
of the universe.

And it's been weeks since I took
that accidental sip of Red Bull.

Did something happen today
that's bothering you?

Well, I did mention

the Mars Rover incident
to that FBI agent

and probably cost Howard
his security clearance.

What?
But why should that keep me up?

Because you feel guilty?

Interesting.

So you're saying my insomnia is
caused by a guilty conscience.

Actually,
you don't have insomnia.

You're sleeping now.

Excuse me?

You're having
a guilt-ridden dream.

Do you have any evidence
to support that hypothesis?

How about that Gorn
sitting on the couch?

That seems fairly conclusive.

No, Gorn, no.

That's where I sit.

Thank you for agreeing
to see me, Agent Page.

Thank <i>you</i> for filing a complaint
with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

I understand
you want to recant

your statement
about Howard Wolowitz.

Yes.
Was your statement untrue?

No.

Then I'm afraid
you can't withdraw it.

I'm sorry. I don't recall
you saying "no backsies."

Is there anything else?

Yes. I'd like to offer
a laudatory statement

about Howard's many excellent
qualities that I believe

will tip the scales
back in his favor.

"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

"H is for honesty,
of which he has much.

"O's for outstanding,

"which he is such.

"W's for witty,
he's quick with a joke.

A's for artistic, his ability...
" I'm sorry.

Dr. Cooper, this matter
is already closed.

But I still have
"rd Joel Wolowitz" left to go.

It's closed.

I don't understand
why you people

are picking on my
friend, Howard,

when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.

For instance,
when I first met Leonard,

he was on the verge
of giving away

rocket secrets
to a North Korean spy,

and not one agent
ever investigated that.

This is Leonard Hofstadter?

No, it's a different Leonard.

He's...

Chinese, red hair, six fingers.

Good-bye.

Raj.

Have you seen Howard?

I think he's eating lunch.

Uh, Sheldon, I want you
to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson

from the Hayden Planetarium
in New York.

I'm quite familiar
with Dr. Tyson.

He's responsible
for the demotion of Pluto

from planetary status.

I liked Pluto.

Ergo I do not like you.

But I actually
didn't demote Pluto.

That was a vote

of the International
Astronomical Union.

If "ifs" and "buts"
were candy and nuts,

we'd all have a merry Christmas.

Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

Is that the guy you
were telling me about?

Oh, yeah.

Howard.

The person at fault for you

not getting
a security clearance is me.

You?

Yes, but before you get upset,
I want you to know

I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.

And they were okay with that?

No. If anything,
I made it worse.

In any case, I have
been riddled with guilt,

which is causing
Gorn-infested REM sleep.

So, I'm here now
to say I'm sorry.

Are you kidding me?

You've set my career back
at least two years,

and you think you can make it
right with "I'm sorry"?

Yes.

I followed the social protocol.

I attempted to right the wrong,
and when I failed to do so,

I delivered a heartfelt apology.

Now you say,

"Apology accepted,"

and I will offer you
a one-time-only high five.

Your apology is not accepted.

You're tricking me.

It really is, isn't it?

Leave me alone, Sheldon.

Dr. Cooper, I just
wanted you to know

I'm sorry for the role I
played in the Pluto matter.

Oh, shut up.

Sheldon?

Hello.

What are you doing here?

I have troubles, Penny.

I've come to pour them out

to the sympathetic ear
of the local barkeep.

You know, they have
a really nice bar

over at the Olive Garden.

I don't like the Olive Garden.

They treat me like family.

Okay, Sheldon.
What can I get you?

Alcohol.

Could you be
a little more specific?

Ethyl alcohol.

40 milliliters.

I'm sorry, honey.
I don't know milliliters.

Ah. Blame President James
"Jimmy" Carter.

He started America on a path
to the metric system

but then just gave up.

He wonders why he
was a one-term president.

Would you say that's
about 40 milliliters?

More or less.
Great.

Now, where were we?

I believe you were about
to ask me to choose a cocktail.

Fortunately, thanks
to computer-savvy alcoholics,

there's an app for that.

Let's see.

Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

Sex on the Beach.
I hardly think so.

Rob Roy,

Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

Ooh!

I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.

A what?
You'll need pitted,

brandied cherries, gin,
rosewater,

Angostura bitters
and overproofed rum.

Now, first, dust
the cherries with sugar,

then spray them with a mixture
of rum and bitters.

Then ignite the rum,
caramel...

Here you go-- one
Rosewater Ricky.

That's not how it looks
in the picture.

Oh, yeah, you know, every
bartender makes it differently.

Why don't you
give it a try.

All right.

To the metric system.

I can't taste the cherries.

All right.
Sheldon, what's on your mind?

I wronged Howard,
and he won't accept my apology.

Oh, right, that.

Yes, Leonard told me.
Sorry, honey.

Penny, you face failure
on a daily basis.

How do you cope?

I drink.

To drinking.

Nope.

Oh, if only there were some way

to force Howard
to accept my apology

so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

You know, sometimes
stuff just happens,

and there's nothing
you can do about it.

For example, Lisa Peterson

hasn't talked to me
since the 11th grade,

because no matter how
much you apologize,

you can't go back and
un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.

I see.

You're saying I'm facing
Starfleet Academy's

unwinnable command scenario:
the Kobayashi Maru.

Exactly.

Sometimes you can't win.

Captain Kirk won.

Kirk cheated.

Impressive that you know that.

It's hard to believe

I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

Right there with you.

Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

That's it.
What?

I'll reprogram Howard.
What...?

Sheldon, you can't
reprogram people.

No, <i>you</i> can't reprogram people.

To James Tiberius Kirk.

Hello, all.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

Not really.

Yes, you are.

I'm using
neurolinguistic programming

to modify your thought patterns.

Oh.

Go away, Sheldon.

There's a $9.95 e-book
down the drain.

What's in the bag?

It's for Howard.

Oh. Sheldon, you can't
fix this with gifts.

Nevertheless, I've hurt you,

and whether you
forgive me or not,

I want you to
have this.

You're giving me
a couch cushion?

No.

The cushion is merely symbolic.

I'm giving you my spot
on the couch.

But you love that spot.

No. I love my mother.

My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

It is the singular location
in space

around which revolves
my entire universe.

And now it's yours.

Oh, my God, dude.
Now you have to forgive him.

All right.

Apology accepted.

High five.

Not too hard.

Thank you.

I haven't cried like this
since <i>Toy Story 3.</i>

I got to tell you,

Sheldon, I understand why
you chose this spot.

I mean, the temperature is
good, but there's no draft.

I can see the television,
but I can still talk to...

I changed my mind.
Get out of my spot.

How long?

94 seconds.

Okay, help me out here.

How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

Maybe he took a class
at the adult bookstore.

That's how I learned.

I can't believe you've never
seen <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

And I can't believe you've
never read <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

When she comes out with

<i>Eat, Pray, Run Away From A</i>
<i>Giant Boulder,</i> I'll read it.

I don't care if <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>
changed your life,

I'm not reading it.

You know, I could totally
rock a hat like that.

That's the work of noted
Hollywood costume designer

Deborah Nadoolman.

She also designed

the iconic red and black jacket

in Michael Jackson's
<i>Thriller</i> video,

which I've never viewed
in its entirety,

as I find zombies dancing

in choreographed synchronicity
implausible.

And also, it's really scary.

Would someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

Penny, if you think
this is good,

you should come with us Friday

to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

Well, I'm watching it now.

Why would I want to see it again
on Friday?

Because the print
they're showing on Friday

has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

21 seconds? That'll be like
seeing a whole new movie!

Exactly.

They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

Did-- Leonard?

I'm no expert, but I believe

what we just heard from Penny
was sarcasm.

Oh! Good.

I'm eight for 26 this month.

Yeah, I think I'll pass.

But you guys enjoy
your extra 21 seconds.

Bet if I could
make you understand

why this is such a cool thing,
we'd still be together.

Mm, yeah, no,
we wouldn't.

Uh-huh.

I'm guessing 21 seconds had
something to do with that, too.

May I point out to you all

that the screening is
"first come, first served"?

Relax, it's 5:00. The movie
doesn't start till midnight.

Another way of saying that is

"the movie starts at midnight,
and it's already 5:00."

Let's go.

You know, if we miss it,
we'll have the fun of

listening to Sheldon whine about
it for the rest of our lives.

See? Howard's on my side.

Actually, I'm not.

I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

Don't worry, Sheldon.
We'll be fine.

What happened to
the Leonard Hofstadter

who waited in line
with me for 14 hours

to see the midnight premiere
of <i>Star Trek: Nemesis?</i>

Oh. Well, he waited
in line for 14 hours,

while you napped
in a lawn chair,

he got in a fight
with a Klingon

when he stepped
out of line to pee

and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him,

and worst of all,
he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>

But how were our seats?

Excellent.

I rest my case.

Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

Actually, as the newest member
of your social group,

I believe I'll gain more
acceptance by arbitrarily

siding with your friends
from time to time.

Shrewd.

Leonard, you're right.

We should enjoy our meal,
arrive late,

and risk winding up
with terrible seats,

assuming we get in at all.

Thank you, Amy.

See? It's working.

Knock-knock.

Who's there?

Olive.

Olive you, too.

Guys, that's really
starting to get old.

Knock-knock.

Who's there?

I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

Hysterical!

Wait, now, we don't know
that yet. He isn't finished.

I have a girlfriend
and you don't <i>who?</i>

So. Are you sure you don't want
to come with us to <i>Raiders?</i>

Oh, no. That movie
has melting faces.

It reminds me
too much of the time

I dropped that vial of
flesh-eating bacteria

into the Rhesus monkey lab.

Besides, Penny and I are having
a girls' night tonight.

Girls' night?
What does that entail?

Oh, you know, girls get
together,

hang out, share girl talk.

I'm a girl.

Oh. Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

No need. Penny and I
are very close.

You are?

Yes. In fact,
our menses are synchronized.

Penny.

Bernadette tells me you're
planning a girls' night.

Yeah?

I'm a girl.

Oh. Um, it was-- it was just
going to be me and Bernadette.

Besides, I thought you
were going to the movies

with Sheldon and the guys.

Yes, but they're not girls.

I'm a girl.

Yeah, no, no,
I-I-I got that.

What's the dress code?

Uh, just wear something
comfortable.

All right.
I'll have to go shopping.

Knock-knock.

Who is there?

Hugh.
Hugh who?

Hugh people need to
listen to me.

It's time to get
in line for the movie.

And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

Under normal circumstances
I'd say, "I told you so."

But as I have told you so

with such vehemence
and frequency already,

the phrase has lost all meaning.

Therefore, I will be
replacing it with the phrase:

"I informed you thusly."

Ooh. Can't wait
for that to start.

I informed you thusly.

Eight for 28.

This is where we could have been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

This is where we could have been

if Koothrappali
hadn't ordered dessert.

Well I earned it, dude,
I ate all my broccoli.

And here's where we are.
The runts in a large litter.

unlikely to ever reach

the nourishing teats
of Indiana Jones.

So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

You know, guys, when
facing disappointment,

<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>  teaches us--

Oh, shut up.

...so anyway, to make
a long story short,

turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

You--
Amy, when we say "girl talk,"

it doesn't just have to
be about our lady parts.

Shame. 'Cause I have a real
zinger about my titled uterus.

Penny, your nails
look great.

Oh, thanks. I found
this place in Alhambra.

It's in a woman's basement.

I think it's a front
for human trafficking,

but they do a really good job.

A colleague of mine did her
graduate thesis on the fungus

that grows on improperly
sterilized manicure implements.

Well don't tell me
that's not "girl talk."

So where should
we go tonight?

A bar? A club? A movie?

Or we could just stay here.

Yes, and continue to bond.

I have a feeling
that after tonight,

one of you will become
my best friend forever.

Or "BFF," if you prefer.

Which I don't.

All right, time to open
Bachelor Number Two.

Gee, I don't know
if I should drink more.

I have to drive home,
and I've got enough trouble

seeing over the dashboard
as it is.

That's okay.
You can just sleep here.

Oh, good, a slumber party!

We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls,

and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties!

Oh, gosh, Amy.

I don't know if I would call
this an actual slumber party.

Well, that's disappointing.

I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

Oh, you never were?

Not even when
you were a kid?

Well, there was the time
I had my tonsils out,

and I shared a room with
a little Vietnamese girl.

She didn't make it
through the night,

but up till then,
it was kind of fun.

Okay. Well, I guess we're
having a slumber party.

Oh!

Pillow fight!

Oh, I hope they
let us in soon.

I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom.

The guy makes me buy
a Gatorade every time.

It's a vicious circle.

Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

What's a stadium pal?

Let me put it this way:

takes care of
the bathroom problem,

and it keeps your calf warm.

Hey, guys, bad news.
I just did a quick calculation.

Given the size of the theater
and the length of this line,

we might not get seats.

What did he say?

Nice going, Raj.

Just got him down for his nap.

We might not get seats?!

It's fine, it's fine.
Go back to sleep.

Oh, I informed you thusly!
I so informed you thusly.

Howard, you talk to him.

Howard?

You're peeing,
aren't you?

Hey, look who's here!

Hey, buddies!

Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

the Jar Jar Binks
of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.

Mee-sa think that very funny!

Well, you-sa can go think that
at the back of the line.

No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

Wil Wheaton.

Yeah.

I'm a big fan.

Of what? Poorly
executed beards?

Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

We got here
a little late.

No problem. Come on,
I'll hook you up.

Awesome.

We-sa gonna go into
the movie now! Bye-bye!

This is <i>Indiana</i> Jones,
not <i>Star Trek.</i>

There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here!

And even at
Star Trek conventions,

they only let him in
if he helps set up!

Calm down, Sheldon.

I will not calm down.

This affront to justice and
decency cannot go unanswered.

As Captain Jean-Luc Picard
once said,

"The line must be drawn here!

"This far, no farther!"

Had to wake him up
from his nap, didn't you?

You know what I really love
about Howard?

His chest hair.

Howard has a
hairy chest?

No, just the one.

But it's really long.

Okay, there you go--
Sultry Sunrise Red.

What do you think?

My nails have never
looked so pretty before.

Get it off.

Oh, oh, uh, looks like
they're getting ready

to let people in.

Listen to what Mr. Wil
Wheaton is tweeting.

"Best seats in house
for <i>Raiders</i> screening.

Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

Why do you read
his Twitter feed?

You know it's only
going to upset you.

I believe in knowing
my enemy, Leonard.

Had Twitter existed at the time,
would not General Custer

have followed the tweets
of Sitting Bull?

Would not Lee have
followed Grant?

Would not Spy have followed Spy?

I have more examples,
but excuse me.

Hello.

Well, this seems
like an odd time

to test my cell phone quality,
but go on.

Test phrases? All right.

Imatote.

Ulba.

Twad.

All together?

I'm a total buttwad.

Why are you laughing?

Hello?

And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

I'm not sure I grasp

the full entertainment value,
but all right.

Next on Wikipedia's list
of slumber party activities:

"Truth or Dare."

Okay, it's your game.
You go first.

Hang on. I'm familiarizing
myself with the rules.

Seems fairly straightforward.

Bernadette, truth or dare?

Truth.
All right.

To what temperature
must you heat beef

in order to
kill the prion

that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?

Um...

Remember, you have
to answer honestly.

Wait. No, Amy, you're
supposed to ask her

something personal
or embarrassing.

Oh.

All right.

What is the circumference
of your areolas?

"Munching on
complimentary popcorn.

Woot, woot."

Oh, the gall.

I hope his next tweet is
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

"Choking to death.

Woot, woot."

Guys, I am sorry.
We are full up.

No!

We're full up.

We really want
to see this.

Isn't there anything
you can do?

Sorry. Fire regulations.
Should've gotten here earlier.

This is nothing but a
blatant abuse of power

by a petty functionary.

Explain to me why
Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

get in and we don't.

'Cause I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

I guess that's that.

Let's go home.

You know what?

I'm going back to
"I told you so."

I told you so.

We can still see something.

Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing two blocks away.

You know Sandy B.
always brings it.

Look-- a side door.

Come on, Short Round.

I guess we'd better
go after him.

Short Round?

Indy's young sidekick
from <i>Temple of Doom.</i>

Yeah, I know who it
is, but why is it me?

You're right. It should
be a cuddly Asian boy.

Like me.

"And Absolon hath
kist hir nether ye,

"and Nicholas is scalded
in the towte.

This tale is doon,
and God save al the rowte."

What the hell was that?

Bernadette dared me to
tell a dirty story.

"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

It would have been hidden
in sock drawers

if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

I thought it was pretty spicy.

Especially the part
where he kisses her nether ye.

You might not
like it as much

if you knew what
"nether ye" meant.

if one cares
about hygiene,

one ought not be kissing it.

Okay, my turn.

Penny, truth or dare?

Truth.

Why are you still hanging out
with Leonard so much

even though you broke up
with him?

Oh, that's an
excellent question.

For two people who claim to be
no longer pair-bonded,

you spend an inordinate amount
of time in each other's company.

Yeah.

Dare.

I don't believe the rules allow

for an ex post facto
option change.

Yeah.

Okay, look, just because we're
not seeing each other anymore

doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

Then, why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

I don't know.

He got really serious,
and I wasn't ready for it.

Interesting.

How will you react
if, in the future,

you become ready for it,
and Leonard is unavailable,

because another woman
has realized that he is--

to use your words--
"a great guy"?

You can only ask one question.

That one.

You know what,
I don't want to play anymore.

Well, I'm not sure
how this is scored,

but I believe
we may have won.

Sheldon?

Sheldon?

Where did he go?

We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

You whistled?

What is that?

<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

with 21 additional seconds.

If I can't see it,
no one else can see it.

Sheldon, this is crazy.

No. Crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

Listen to me.

You are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

Trouble is my middle name,
Leonard.

Actually, it's Lee,
but I prefer Trouble.

Oh, look who
they let in.

Don't worry, Wil Wheaton.
I was just leaving.

Come on, Short Round.

Yeah.

Come on, guys!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

Let's see you run

with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

He's got the movie! Get him!

Why is there never a pontoon
plane when you need one?

She's been in there
a long time.

Clearly, losing Truth or Dare
upset her.

Perhaps we should try
to take her mind off it

with another popular
slumber party activity.

Ooh, like what?
Well, the Internet suggests

that slumber party guests
often engage

in harmless experimentation
with lesbianism.

Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

Penny?
Oh, hey, Amy.

Look, I'm sorry I got
so upset. I just...

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What are you doing?

Don't worry. I'll
avoid the nether ye.

I might have gone
with eating raw cookie dough.

You know who's got to be
the bravest person

in the Marvel Universe?

Whoever has to give
She-Hulk a bikini wax.

You want to talk brave,

how about Captain America's
undocumented Mexican gardener?

He's not braver than

whoever uses the bathroom
after The Thing?

As usual, you're all wrong.

The bravest person
in the Marvel Universe

is the doctor who gives
Wolverine his prostate exam.

How about the guy who gets

a prostate exam from Wolverine?

Now you're just being silly.

Wolverine's never displayed

the slightest interest
in helping others

prevent prostate cancer.

Hello.

Yes, the elevator's
out of order;

you'll have to use the stairs.

Of course you can.

Pizza dates back
to the 16th century,

while the first elevator
was not installed until 1852.

That means that
for over 300 years,

people carried pizzas up stairs.

Be part of that proud tradition.

I'll go get Penny while that guy
spits on our food.

Do you think they gave Wolverine
an adamantium prostate?

That's a stupid question.

We're having
a conversation about

probing the heinies
of superheroes.

There are no stupid questions.

Yes?

Oh, um, is
Penny here?

You're Leonard, right?

Yeah.

Damn, it's good
to finally meet you, son.

Okay, I think a bit of
context here might help.

Oh, hey, Leonard.
I see you met my dad.

Oh, good.

Context.

Come on in, buddy.

Take a load off.

Oh, gee, Dad,
Leonard can't stay.

He just dropped by to say hello.

Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

I'll see you later.

Bye.

That was odd.

Are you sure you have
enough comics?

You're going to be monitoring
the telescope for 12 hours,

and by my estimate,
you've only selected

seven hours of reading material.

That's even factoring in

your difficulty in parsing
American comic book idioms

like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

Is that racist?

It feels racist.

Don't be oversensitive.

He's calling <i>you</i> illiterate,
not your race.

Oh, okay. Good.

I don't need
more comics.

Howard's gonna stop by,
we're gonna play

Intergalactic Battleship
and Indian Monopoly.

I don't care for
novelty editions of Monopoly.

I prefer the classics:
regular and Klingon.

Actually, Indian Monopoly's

just like regular,
except the money's in rupees,

instead of hotels
you build call centers,

and when you pick a Chance card,
you might die of dysentery.

Just FYI,

that was racist.

You'll never guess
what just happened.

You went out in the hallway,

stumbled into
an interdimensional portal

which brought you 5,000 years
into the future,

where you took advantage
of the advanced technology

to build a time machine,
and now you're back

to bring us all with you
to the year 7010

where we are transported
to work at the Thinkatorium

by telepathically controlled
flying dolphins?

No.

Aw.

Penny kissed me.

Well, who would ever guess that?

What-what kind of a kiss?

A big kiss. On the mouth.

Is it possible that she was
going for your cheek

and you moved
and she accidentally got lip?

That happens with me and my mom
all the time.

She introduced me to her father,

kissed me and then
shut the door in my face.

Maybe she was trying
to send you a message.

You think?

Yeah.
"This man is not my father.

"I'm being held hostage.

"So I'm going to do

"something insane in the hopes

that you'll call 911."

Penny kissing me is not insane.

She used to kiss me
all the time.

Einstein defined insanity
as "doing the same thing

over and over again and
expecting different results."

By that standard,

Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

I'm just saying,

it felt like it may have
meant something.

Ah, this takes me back.

Leonard obsessing about Penny.

I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love your new stuff,

but once in a while
it's nice to hear the hits.

Ooh, ooh!

Do "Our babies will be smart
and beautiful."

That one always makes me laugh.

Why do I bother
talking to you people?

If it'll make you feel better,
we rarely listen.

Hey, can I talk to you
out here for a sec?

Yeah, sure.

I'm starting to think we're
never going to see that pizza.

So you're probably wondering
what that was all about.

What, uh, the kissing
and everything?

Nah, women do that to me
all the time.

Yeah, okay.
The thing is, I kind of

told my father
we got back together again.

What? Why?

Well, you're the first guy

he's ever really approved of,
you know?

You're a scientist
who went to college

and you don't have a neck tattoo

or outstanding warrants
or... or a baby.

What kind of guys
did you used to go out with?

Just guys.

Anyway, when I told him
we split up, he was heartbroken,

and he kept bugging me:
"How's Leonard?

"Why can't you get
back together with Leonard?

I bet Leonard never
tipped a cow over on himself."

So to get him off my back,

I told him
we worked things out.

Really?

How-how'd we manage that?

What?

I mean, did you apologize?

Did you have to woo me?

Get over yourself.

I whistled, you came running.

Yeah, no, I don't think so.

Okay, why are you
arguing about this?

I'm just saying,

if we fake got back together,

that's totally not
how it fake happened.

Oh...

Okay, whatever.

Will you please just play along
until my dad leaves?

Hold on, you actually want me

to deceive your father
with some sort of

sham play acting and kissing?

'Cause I'm good with that.

Penny, you out here?

Come on, honey,
not in front of my dad.

Relax, I've seen you do
a lot worse with a lot stupider.

See?

He doesn't mind.

So, Leonard,
I'm taking your gal out

for a steak dinner;
you want to join us?

Oh, Dad, that's nice,
but Leonard has to work.

Right, Leonard?

Uh, I do, I
have to work.

But I'm gonna blow that
off to spend the evening

with my sweetie and her
father, 'cause, you know,

just the kind of
boyfriend I am.

Oh.

Come here, you.

C-7.

Miss.

How could that be a miss?

C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

Part of your starship
has to be on C-7.

Not if it has a hole
in the middle.

What kind of spaceship
has a hole in the middle?

A Romulan Battle Bagel?

Knock-knock.

Oh, great, you made it.

Come on in.

I invited her.

So where's
the telescope?

It's in Hawaii, but Raj
controls it from here.

He's hoping to see Epsilon
Eridani dim, which would be

evidence of a planet
orbiting it.

So we just sit and stare
at the screen,

waiting for
something to happen?

I did it with you when
we rented <i>The Notebook.</i>

Yes, Gena Rowlands
is a treasure.

You'd better open up
that bottle of wine

or I'm gonna end up
with swimmer's ear.

Excuse me.

I can't be drinking,
I'm about to make

an important scientific
discovery here.

What? Galileo did his best work
while drinking wine.

How do you know that?

Well, he was Italian.

It's a reasonable assumption.

Dude, can you even
open your mouth

without spewing a
cultural stereotype?

Oh, I-I'm sorry,
Galileo drank Diet Sprite.

Look, you're my best friend,
she's my girlfriend;

you should bond.

You know,
like you and my mom did.

Your mom creeps
the hell out of me.

Yes, but she's stopped
calling you Slumdog Millionaire.

I do appreciate that.

Here we go.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To science and friendship.

Hold on. Wait.

No, it's okay, go ahead.

What?

Oh, I was working with

penicillin-resistant gonorrhea
in the lab today

and I was just trying to
remember if I washed my hands.

Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

My pleasure.

It's nice to have dinner
with a boyfriend of Penny's

that knows how to use a napkin.

So not funny, Dad.

Let me tell you about this one
genius she was going out with,

this-this
fella Donnie.

Oh, will you please let it go?

Donnie was gonna make millions
turning farm waste

into biofuel and selling it
to the government.

A lot of people are doing that.

Oh, see?

Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix
pig poop with a little water

and pump it
into his mom's Camry.

Yeah, that's great.

It's a funny story. Moving on.

And Donnie was a rocket
scientist compared to that boy

who wanted to get beer pong
into the Olympics.

What was his
name, sweetheart?

Curtis, and I'm pretty sure
he was joking.

I don't know.

That petition
looked real to me.

Yeah, okay, I think this ends

the ex-boyfriend portion
of our evening.

Well, I'm just glad you finally
found yourself a keeper.

Thanks, Wyatt.

I'm a keeper.

Leonard, you want to come in
for a nightcap?

Oh, gee, Dad,
he'd love to,

but Leonard has to work
in the morning.

Maybe I could
go in a little late.

No, no, no, you can't.

Your career is
far too important.

Behind every great man
is a nagging woman

who won't let him have any fun,
am I right, Leonard?

Don't I know it.

Well, good night, son.

Good night, Wyatt.

Oh, good
night, honey.

Good night.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Oh, friggety-frak.

Not this again.

Three, four, five--
pass go, get 2,000 rupees--

six, seven.

Whoops. Can't go any further.
There's a sacred cow in my way.

Bernadette, please
tell your boyfriend

to cool it with
the cow jokes.

It won't help.

Once he finds a joke he likes,
he sticks with it.

Yeah.

Like his haircut material.

Oh, right.
Did you get your hair cut?

"No. I got them all cut."

Which is still
so funny.

And when you go
to a Chinese restaurant,

he always gets the same fortune
in his fortune cookie.

Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

in a Chinese
fortune cookie factory."

Okay, I think that's enough
about me.

He's right. Let's make
fun of his mother.

"Howard, come rub my feet!

My corns are killing me!"

"Howard, help me
out of the tub!

I'm stuck again!"

Coming.

Hey, lovebug.

Shut up.

You know what I've been doing
for the last hour?

Mm, dreamily doodling
"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

in a notebook?

Listening to my father
go on and on

about what a great guy you are.

You got to admit,
I am... I'm delightful.

Why are you making this
so difficult?

It's not difficult for me.

I'm having fun.

Leonard.

What do you want me to do?
You started this.

Do you want to go over
and tell him we're broken up?

No.
Well, then, what do you want?

I don't know.

Don't you think that's something
you should

have figured out
before you stomped over here?

Maybe.

Leonard, Penny, excellent.

I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together,

and if I can figure out
a way to do so

and sound sincere, I will.

In the meantime,

I'd like to go over
some proposed changes

to the roommate agreement
specifically to address

Penny's annoying
personal habits.

Oh, my God.

What personal habits?
I have a list.

FYI, overuse of the phrase
"Oh, my God" is number 12.

Okay, Sheldon,
you don't have to do this

because Leonard and I are not...
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

Are you sure you want
to include him in this?

Include me in what?

Is there a plot afoot?

I'll have no
truck with plots.

No, you're right.

No, there's... there's no plots,
no trucks, no feet.

So what other annoying habits
shall we discuss?

Uh, we don't
discuss anything.

Leonard is the signatory
to the roommate agreement.

As such, he bears
responsibility

for all your infractions
and must pay all fines.

Fines?
Yes.

If Penny's going to be
spending nights here again,

you'll need to set up
an escrow account.

Sign here.

Hello, Hawaii.

This is Dr. Koothrappali
in Pasadena.

I'd like you to reposition
the telescope, please.

Scarlett Johansson's house!

I'm kidding, Hawaii.

Mahalo.

Whoo!

It might have
been a mistake

to open that second
bottle of wine.

Well, live and learn.

So, Raj, do you think this
planet you're looking for

could have an atmosphere
that supports life?

Maybe.

If it did, I'd be famous.

I'd be on the cover
of magazines.

And then,
instead of living alone

in my tiny apartment,
I'd have a big mansion.

That sounds great.

It is.

If you like wandering
around a big, empty house

with no one to love you.

We'd come visit you.
No, you wouldn't.

You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

My only friends would be

my genetically engineered
monkey butler

and the little people I hired
to be my living chess set.

He's taking a turn to
the dark side, isn't he?

Hold on.
He could come back.

Oh, what's the point
of everything?

Nope. He's gone.

You know it's been more
than a year

since I've even kissed a girl?

What about that hookup
at Comic-Con you told me about?

Oh, grow up. I was lying.

I lie all the time.
Nobody wants to kiss me.

Oh, you poor, poor thing.

Raj, you have to know
you're a wonderful man.

There are a lot of girls out
there who'll want to kiss you.

Where?

You just have to look.

No!

Well, this was fun.

Oh! I think
I got a nibble.

Oh, be careful.

Give him some line.

Okay, now reel him in.

Oh, look at that baby.

They're really biting, huh?

Yeah. They do that
when you set it on easy.

Oh, that's me.

Hello.

Oh, hi, sweetie.

Yeah, I got up early
and didn't want to wake you,

so I went out for coffee and ran
into Leonard on the way back.

Guess what-- we're fishing.

Yeah. Right here on his couch.

Hey, baby. I love you!

That's Leonard.

Says he loves you.

What?

I see.

The whole thing's
bull squirt, huh?

Well, that's very disappointing.

Bye.

Oh, hey.

There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

I can't believe you would
lie to me like that.

Just for the record, I did not
want to be a part of this.

I'll get to you in a minute.

No hurry.

That my own daughter thinks
I don't love her enough

to support her no matter
what choices she makes--

well, that hurts me deeply.

I'm sorry, Daddy...
Let me finish.

Oh.

I thought we were
past the days

when you would try
to pull the wool over my eyes.

Telling me the baggie in your
underwear drawer is potpourri?

And the pee stick
in your bathroom

is to check for diabetes?

You know, I'm sorry.

You're a grown woman,
and I respect your right

to make your own decisions,
but all I ask

is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

You're right. Look, from now on,
I will tell you the truth.

Thank you. Now, why don't you go
and put some clothes on

and we'll grab a bite to eat
before I head for the airport.

- Now you.
- Daddy, he had nothing to do...

- Keep walking.
- Okay.

Please, please, please
don't give up on her.

What?

I can't go back to the
skateboard idiots,

the white rappers
and all those

sweaty dumb-asses with
their backwards hats.

Gee, I don't know
if it's in the cards, sir.

Then, stack the deck.

Cheat.

Lie. I don't care.

I want grandkids before I die,

and I want them to grow up
in a house without wheels.

I'll give it a shot.

Thank you.

Now I'm going to do something
here to help you along.

Excuse me?
Just don't panic.

Now, get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face

and make sure I
never see it again!

Oh, the reverse psychology
thing.

I see. That's very clever.

Don't yap. Just get out.

I'll friend you on Facebook.

Oh, there you are.

Just so you know,
I was up all night,

but I have finally completed

the Penny-specific section
of the new roommate agreement.

Yeah, well, not necessary.

We broke up again.

Do you even think
about other people, Leonard?

Do you?

- Hey.
- Oh, how'd it go last night?

Oh, you know.

Same old, same old.

Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars.

Big whoop.

Really?

You waited months
for time with that telescope.

What happened?

Why? You writing a book?

I'm going to propose
a hypothesis.

Last night,
Raj accidentally made contact

with an alien civilization

and has been ordered
by the United States government

to keep it a secret.

Nothing happened.

Can we please just
change the subject?

That sounds rehearsed.

We are not alone.

Hey.

Hey.
Hello.

Hey.
Hey.

You get to play with
Raj's big telescope last night?

Whoa.

Where did that come from?

He never touched my telescope.

Way to go shutting up.

I did shut up. Now you shut up.

Fine.
Thank you.

I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.

Clarify something for me.

Isn't the point

of a communal meal

the exchange of ideas
and opinions?

An opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

It is.

You just kind of put
a damper on things

when you said,
"The next person I see talking

with food in their mouth
will be put to death."

Well, we could argue about
who said what all night long,

but to set things back
on course,

I will propose
a new topic of conversation.

Great.

What is the best number?

By the way, there's only
one correct answer.

5,318,008?

Wrong.

The best number is 73.

You're probably wondering why.

No. Uh-uh.
We're good.

73 is the 21st prime number.

Its mirror, 37, is the 12th,
and its mirror, 21,

is the product of multiplying--

hang on to your hats--
seven and three.

Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

We get it.

73 is the Chuck Norris
of numbers.

Chuck Norris wishes.

In binary 73 is a palindrome:

"one-zero-zero-
one-zero-zero-one"

which backwards is "one-zero-
zero-one-zero-zero-one"--

exactly the same.

All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

Just for the record,

when you enter 5,318,008
on a calculator,

upside-down it spells "boobies""

Remember when you were wondering

why the girls didn't
want to eat with us tonight?

Yeah, I get it now.

I love your little
heart locket, Bernadette.

Oh, thanks.

Howard gave it to me.

It's the cutest thing.

Every time I have
dinner with his mom,

the next day I get jewelry.

Did you know that the iconic
Valentine's heart shape

is not actually based
on the shape of a human heart,

but rather on the shape
of the buttocks

of a female bending over?

Oh, so I spent seventh grade

dotting my I's
with little asses?

Cool.

Hey, Penny, how's it going?

Hey, Zack,
what are you doing here?

My dad's company prints
the menus for this place.

I'm just dropping off
some new ones laminated.

Makes 'em easier to clean
if people throw up on 'em.

Guess how I got the idea?

Yeah, I got it, I got it.

Uh, Zack, these are
my friends Bernadette and Amy.

- Hi.
- Hey.

Hoo.

Okay, well, it was
good to see you.

Yeah, you, too.

He's really cute.
How do you know him?

Oh, we went out
a couple of times.

I'm often flummoxed
by current slang.

Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

Yes.
No, no.

But in this case, yes.

Interesting.

And was it not satisfactory?

No, it was great.

He just didn't really challenge
me on an intellectual level.

Couldn't you just fool around
with him and then listen to NPR?

Wouldn't help. Zack
can't even spell NPR.

It's what I do with Howard.

I'm much smarter than he is.

But it's important
to protect his manhood.

Hoo.

What's the matter?

I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy,

my mouth is dry.

In addition, I keep
involuntarily saying "hoo."

Oh, we know what's
causing that, don't we?

It's no mystery.

I obviously have the flu

coupled with sudden-onset
Tourette's syndrome.

âª Our whole universe

Did you hear about the
accident at the bio lab?

No.
What happened?

They were injecting rats
with radioactive isotopes

and one of the techs got bit.

Did he get superpowers?

No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

Why?

Well, you get bit by a
radioactive animal in a lab,

you kind of want to turn
into a superhero.

Yeah, but who'd want
to become Rat-Man?

Who wouldn't?

You could zip through
a maze in nothing flat,

squeeze through
really small holes,

and shut down restaurants
in a single bound.

And the best part is,
if I were Rat-Man,

you could be my
sidekick, Mouse Boy.

Mouse Boy?

You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

How about "Kid Vermin"?

First of all,
if we had superpowers,

I wouldn't be the sidekick.
You'd be the sidekick.

Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

Leonard, settle this.

Of the two of us, who's
the obvious sidekick?

Yeah, Leonard, who?

12 years after high school,
and I'm still at the nerd table.

Aren't you slicing that
man's brain a little too thin?

It's too thin if I were making

a foot-long brain sandwich
at Quiznos.

For examination under a two-
photon microscope, it's fine.

Well, you're the expert.

If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

Very well.

If you die and donate
your body to science,

I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

Thank you.

Now, if you'll
excuse me,

I have to take my temperature.

Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms

in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

I did that one summer.

Ah, youth.

No, I experienced some
distressing symptoms last night,

so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

I'd be happy to create a chart

and participate in a
differential diagnosis.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

All right.

What were the symptoms?

Elevated heart rate,
moist palms, dry mouth

and localized
vascular throbbing.

Localized to what region?

Ears and genitalia.

Interesting.

Not body parts
that usually team up.

What about
environmental factors?

Describe the scene for me.

I was sitting in a restaurant
with Penny and Bernadette,

drinking water-- carbonated
as it was a special occasion.

Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

Who?

Zack.

Then why did you ask?

Ask what?
Who.

Zack.

All right, let's start over.

What did you say
when Zack walked in?

"Hoo."
Zack.

Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

Because you keep saying "who."

I'm not saying "hoo" now.

I said "hoo" last night.

And the answer was Zack,
correct?

There was no question.

I simply said "hoo."

All right, I think
I have enough to go on.

Possible explanations
for your symptoms are,

in descending order
of likelihood:

hyperthyroidism,
premature menopause,

hosting an alien parasite or--

and I only include it
for the sake of covering

absolutely all bases--
sexual arousal.

Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

There you are.

Oh, hey.

Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

I don't know. Um...

Nuclear war.

Accidentally being
buried alive.

Any of those movies where
you get that phone call

that says you're
going to die.

And then you do.

No. Something very specific

that we both know you,

Rajesh Koothrappali,
are terrified of.

Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

The thought of
losing a toe...

Spiders!
You're afraid of spiders!

What the heck is this?

A jar with a big spider
in it, of course.

Bravery test.

First one to take his hand out
is the sidekick.

Are you crazy?

Perhaps.

Are you scared?

No. But it's a stupid test.

Oh, really?
What if the earth was in danger

and the only way to save it was

to stick your hand
in a jar with a spider?

Oh, yeah?
What if the earth was in danger

and the only way
to save it was to take a shower

in the locker room and let
other guys see you naked?

Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

Put your hand
in the jar

or forever be revealed
as my sidekick.

All right, I will.

How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

It's easy.

The spider's crawling
up your arm.

Get it off! Get it off!

Please, Raj!

Please.

Oh!

My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

Cortisol levels normal.

How about your

follicle-stimulating hormone
levels?

Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

Are you sure?

You said that with
the testy bark of an old biddy.

I think we need
to face the cold, hard truth:

I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

Hang on. I don't know

that we've given
the alien parasite hypothesis

a fair shake.

Let's look at this logically.

I have a stomach; I get hungry.

I have genitals; I have the
potential for sexual arousal.

A cross we all must bear.

You know, in difficult
moments like this,

I often turn to a force
greater than myself.

Religion?

Star Trek.

Did you see
<i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture?</i>

No.
Don't. It's terrible. However...

in it, we learn that

when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic

by feelings bubbling up from his
human half, he suppresses them

using the Vulcan mental
discipline of Kolinar.

Are you suggesting
we live our lives

guided by the philosophies
found in cheap science fiction?

"Cheap science fiction"?

What are you doing?

Using Kolinar to suppress
my anger at that last comment.

Is it possible that your
concern for me at this moment

is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

I hadn't considered that.

Give me a moment.

All right, I've considered it.

And?
I reject it.

You reject it because
you don't feel jealousy,

or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

I think
I'll eat my lunch at home.

That's not your
lunch, Sheldon;

those are the cadaver
brain specimens.

Oh.

As they were incorrectly sliced,

you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

Hello.

Hey. Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

If this one under-
or over-softens,

I'll need time
to make things right.

That's thinking ahead.

The alternative would be
to think backwards.

That's just remembering.

So how's Amy?

Amy's changed.

I might have to let her go.

Oh, no. Why?

I thought she was
a highly evolved creature

of pure intellect, like me.

But recent events indicate that

she may be a slave
to her baser urges.

Like you.

Just going to
skip over that insult.

What insult?

Yeah. That's why
I'm going to skip over it.

Are you saying that Amy is...

oh, what's the
scientific word...

Forget science. She's horny.

Oh! Okay. Wow.

It's simple biology. There's
nothing I can do about it.

Are you sure?

What are you suggesting?

I'm suggesting there
might be something

you could do about...
Amy's urges?

It's illegal to spay
a human being.

Yeah. That's not
what I had in mind.

Oh.

Oh!

You mean...
something <i>I</i> could do.

Exactly.

Well, I was hoping
to avoid this.

But I might as well
get it over with.

Thank you, Penny.

I'll let you
know what happens.

Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Is this the Zack Johnson

who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny?

Sorry to bother you.

Hello. I'm looking
for a Zack Johnson

who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

Coitus. It means intercourse.

And I have a feeling I'm
speaking to the right Zack.

This is Sheldon Cooper.

Fine. Shelly.

Yes, that does
sound like a girl's name.

No, it doesn't bother me.

Yes, "Smelly Shelly"
does bother me.

Let me tell you why I'm calling.

I'd like to know
if you'd be interested

in having sex
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

Amy Farrah Fowler.

Yes, that <i>is</i>  a girl's name.

Good grief. It's like trying
to talk to a dolphin.

Really?

This is going to decide who's
the hero and who's the sidekick?

You got a better idea?

Every idea is better
than this idea.

Ding!

Wait. What the hell is "ding"?
It's a bell.

I don't think this
kind of wrestling has a bell.

Fine. How do you
want to start?

I say, uh, how about
one, two, three, go?

One-two-three-go?
That's for babies.

Okay, how about, uh...

On your mark, get set, go?

That's for a footrace.
If you want to race,

we have to go outside.

No, it's chilly outside.
Didn't bring my jacket.

Oh, for crying out loud.

What kind of superhero
needs a jacket?

What kind of superhero says,
"Dibs on the red tights!

Dibs on the red tights!"

All right, how about this?
Ready, wrestle.

Wait. Are we starting now? Or
is that what you're going to say

when we do start, or...
We're starting now!

Don't yell at me!

Suppose there are worse ways
to spend a Friday night.

None come to mind.

Look at this stamp.
On what authority

are they permitted to
mutilate patrons as they enter?

I'm sure it'll wash off.

Little comfort tonight.

I look like a Hell's Angel.

There's Zack.

Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

It's not what I want to do;

it's what I have to do.

Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

Follow your endocrine system.

Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

Please don't drag this out.

This is never going to come off.

Excuse me?

Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler.
We met the other night.

I have spent my life in
pursuit of pure knowledge.

Until I met you,
my decisions

were founded in
logic and reason.

And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen,

longing to grab hold
of your gluteus maximus

and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical

beast with two backs.

My gluteus what?

On the other hand,

as I look at the blank, ape-like
expression on your face,

I have decided to adopt the
Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

Good-bye, Zack.
Bye.

Hoo.

That should hold me for a while.

I'm legally obligated
to inform you

that I took a karate lesson
when I was 11.

I'd be a regular ninja by now

if my mom could've
arranged a carpool.

Oh, yeah?

Well, I've been taking
Pilates class at the rec center,

and my abs look like
sections of a Hershey bar.

Oh, yeah? Won't matter,
you're going down!

No, uh-uh, you're going down!

If anybody's going to go down,
it's going to be you.

Fellas. It's been 30 minutes.
Nobody's touched each other.

I'm glad you decided to reject
your animal hindbrain

and return to the
realm of pure intellect.

As am I.

What are you doing?

An experiment.

Nope. Nothing.
Never mind.

You realize you can't win.

I prefer to think
that I can't lose.

You're wrong.

It's only a matter of time

before you fall into
Rat-Man's rat trap.

You pathetic fool!

If there were a rat-catcher,
wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

Just because I didn't
express myself well

doesn't mean my
underlying point was invalid!

You bloviating buffoon!

You narcissistic nincompoop!

You crimson coward!

Oh, Leonard, wake up,

you're missing some very
excellent superhero quips.

Hey.

Hey, your copy of <i>Science</i>

- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

Check it out--
all about planets this month.

That's an atom.

Agree to disagree.

That's what I love
about science--

there's no
one right answer.

So...

you and Zack again, huh?

Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

Were we here earlier?

Okay, we should,
we should go.

Ah, not yet.

I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

What do you want
to talk about--

rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

it'll just come back to life.

Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

It was a great show.

They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

They might be smarter
than <i>some</i> people.

Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

That's easy enough.

We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

you find tasty.

I don't get it.

A dolphin might.

Oh, I see.

You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

That's not correct.

We were implying it.

You then inferred it.

Let's go.

You know, for a group of guys

Do you think
Penny's right?

Were we bullying Zack?

No,

I know bullying.

He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

That happened to you?

First day of cricket camp.

They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

So go apologize.
Why me?

You started it,
we just piled on.

What would I even say?

Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

Have a Milk Dud.

A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

and remarkably mild flavor,

are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

I got a better idea.

We're all responsible.

I say we all go.

Come on, who's with me?

Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

You're embarrassing
yourself.

Penny.

What?
Yeah,

we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

What do you want?

Listen,

the stuff
we were saying before--

we were just kidding around.

No, you weren't.

You were making fun
of me.

Come on, that's what we do.

We give each other a hard time.

Hey, Sheldon,

you look
like a praying mantis.

That's very hurtful.

See?

I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

Milk Dud?

Oh, I love Milk Duds.

Okay, we're cool.

Junior Mints.

You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

Leonard's buying.

Really?

I haven't been
to a comic book store

in literally
a million years.

Literally?

Literally a
million years?

Don't.

You want to go with 'em?
No.

Okay, see you later.
Wait,

w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

Are you mad at me?

I'm not happy.

Milk Dud?

Wow, this place
is awesome.

Where do they keep
the <i>Archies?</i>

In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school <i>Archie.</i>

It's much more
sophisticated now.

Like, there's
two universes,

and Archie's married
to Betty in one

and Veronica
in the other.

Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

No.

About time, right?

Hey.

Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

He's a friend
of ours.

Zack, this is Stuart.

He owns
the store.

Wow, lucky you.

Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

and average
$1.65 an hour.

Sweet.

Is that sarcasm?

No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

The <i>Archies</i> are over here.

Yippee.

So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

Of course.

We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

Switching it up from last year

when we came as
the Justice League of America.

To that point,

it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

to finally snare
Best Group Costume

if we shore up
our weak link,

which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

Hey, I got
new boots this year.

Guaranteed to add
three inches.

That's sad.

Let's ask ourselves:

Is there anyone we know

who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

moving his lips
as he enjoys

the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

Zack?

He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

You can't replace
me with Zack.

Why not?
Penny did it.

Yeah, she seems happier.

Why wouldn't we be?

Score.

I got an <i>Archie,
Betty and Veronica,</i>

and a <i>Jughead.</i>

All set
for my weekend number twos.

Congratulations.

Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

I want to be
Green Lantern.

But I'm Green Lantern.

You can be Aquaman.

I don't want to be Aquaman.

He sucks.

He sucks
underwater.

He sucks
fish pee.

Excuse me,

I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

Hey, babe.

I'm still mad at you.

Well, you won't be

when you hear the great news.

What great news?

We're going to
a costume party

at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

Invisible plane sold separately.

Wait, why me?

Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

She isn't the free spirit I am.

Okay, well, forget it.

I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

What are you doing?

We're going
to be late.

I'm pacing nervously.

You're jogging.

This is how the
Flash paces.

Just chill out, Sheldon.

I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

to scream in frustration.

I'm back.

I'm Batman.

Oh, I hardly think so.

The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

when he's running late.

I had to walk.

I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

Aquaman sucks.

Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

I forget the rest.

All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

I'm sorry.

But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

Ow!

I mean,

ow.

Hold on. The costume came

with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

Well, actually...

Don't.
He's making our case.

Okay, babe. Uh...

Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

Okay.
You know what?

I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

Looks like someone
else is going

to have to be Wonder Woman.

Babe, open up.

I'm not talking to you.

Then who are you talking to?

Babe?

Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

Penny, Penny...

What the hell
is wrong with you?

I'm the Flash.

I just knocked 30,000 times.

Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

I understand
why you're upset.

Really?

Yes.

You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

No.

Wh-What...

Does it?

Don't worry.

Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

Good-bye, Sheldon.

But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

Hello?

Stupid Aquaman.

If it makes you
feel any better,

when I was dating Penny,

she used to flip out
on me all the time.

Whoa. You dated Penny?

She didn't tell you?

She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

Who would have
thought it was you?

Who else would it be?

I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

I may have failed.

Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

I don't want to go
without Penny.

Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

All we've got is a skinny Flash,

an Indian Aquaman,

a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

Ooh, I call Kermit.

I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

No, we can still
make this work.

Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

What makes you think
I can convince her?

You got her
to have sex with you.

Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

just so we can win
a stupid prize?

Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

Go away, Sheldon.

It's Leonard.

Oh.

Go away, Leonard.

Come on, let me
just talk to you.

It's open.

Hey.

I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

just by showing up with a girl.

It's not the wig.

Did I do something?

I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

given how you and me
used to be...

you know, "you and
me," and now you

and him are
"you and him."

Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

Then what are you?

I don't know.

I only started seeing Zack again

so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

How pathetic is that?

Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

You make a cute Green Arrow.

Green Lantern.

Like there's a difference.

There's a big difference.

Arrow.

Lantern.

Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

but this, with the costumes,
and you...

What about me?

Nothing.

Let's go to the party.

How do I look?

Um...

I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

Oh.
Yes.

What's the bad news?

Superman probably isn't

getting laid tonight.

Aw, damn.

And the award

for best group costume
goes to...

Justice League of America...

Number three!

Thank you!
Thank you so much!

Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

Ten, nine, eight...

No, wait!

I have a speech.

Seven, six...
Stop counting!

Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

Two, one!

Happy New Year!

I'm not going
to say another word

until you people settle down.

I'm waiting.

That was a
great party.

We should dress like
this all the time.

Are you high?

You're being
a bully.

Check it out.

Those guys are breaking
into that car.

What should we do?

We're the Justice League
of America.

There's only one thing
we can do.

Turn around
and slowly walk away.

Nah.

Hold up.

Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

so I'm going
to turn it down.

Good Lord,

how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!

Fine.

Ma, Ma, calm down.

Listen to me.

I know it says click
with the mouse,

but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

Now, put your finger on it.

Doesn't matter which finger.

Good choice.

Now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

Yeah, the little envelope.

What do you mean,
"What does it look like?"

It looks like an envelope!

Fine, you don't like
the computer,

don't use it!

Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

I won't say that
all senior citizens

who can't master technology
should be publicly flogged,

but if we made an
example of one or two,

it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

I had a great idea.

You know how
we're always having

to stop and solve
differential equations,

like when you're doing
Fourier analysis,

or using the
Schrodinger equation?

Howard doesn't.
He's only an engineer.

I was thinking,
we could write a little app

that would use
handwriting recognition,

and then run it through a
symbolic evaluation engine.

You just use your smartphone,

take a picture
of the equation and bam!

You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

You know, Leonard,

that's actually
a valid idea.

Very good.

Can you say that and not
make it sound like I'm a cat

who learned
how to use the toilet?

No.

The two achievements
are equally surprising

and equally admirable,

though if pressed,

I'd have to give
a slight edge to the cat.

I'll save you the pain
and nervousness

of waiting for the answer.

I agree to be part of
your project. Congratulations.

Oh, yay for me.

What about you guys?

I can't promise anything,

but people do make money
off stuff like this.

A few extra bucks
would be nice.

I could finally move out
of my mother's house.

Where would you go?

I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own

over the garage.

You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off from work

and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

What's that?

Some weird sex thing?

No.

You take pretty girls underwater

in your private submarine,
and you show them fish.

Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

I was thinking we could work
on this at night,

and then maybe
in a couple of weeks,

we'll have ourselves an app
to sell.

Sounds like
we're in business.

I think we should take a picture
to capture this moment.

Yeah.
Oh!

Was that the best 99 cents
I ever spent, or what?

I checked the
App Store.

No one is doing

handwriting-recognition
differential equation solving.

Oh, dear Lord, shush.

What?

You have so few good ideas,
Leonard.

And you're just going
to spill the beans

in front of an outsider?

Who, me?

Sheldon, I don't think
Penny cares

about handwriting-recognition
based differential...

âª The stars at night
are big and bright âª

âª Deep in the heart
of Texas... âª

She's not going
to steal our idea.

What idea?
We're gonna write an application...

âª The prairie sky

âª Deep in the heart... âª

Okay, stop, stop!

âª Of Texas. âª

Whatever your secret is,

I'm sure it's boring,
so I'm not interested.

It's not boring at all.

You see,
in higher order mathematics,

there are certain sets

of equations that...
Bored.

Satisfied?

Hardly.

Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

A young woman alone
in the big city.

Her ridiculous dream

of becoming an actress
lies shattered about her.

Hey, wait a minute.

Well, hang on. Let's
see where he's going.

Then it hits her.

How is she going to survive?

I mean, she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

And then one day,

she meets a group of geniuses

and their friend Howard.

Hey, I...

Hang on.
Let's see where he's going.

She befriends them,
and then lies in wait

until they reveal
a marketable idea,

which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

- That is ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

Let's see you come up
with an explanation

as to why this woman hangs out
with us all the time.

Oh, great. You know what?

I've already mooched
dinner off you guys.

I don't need to listen to this.

There's your answer--
free food.

All right,
I've taken the liberty

of drafting
these workflow charts

which outline our various duties
and the path we will follow

as we develop
our ground-breaking new app.

Hey, why am I in charge
of phone support?

Seems a bit racist.

A customer service
representative

with an Indian accent
will create the impression

we're a vast enterprise that
uses overseas call centers.

Oh.

Very clever.

But still racist.

Duly noted, Steve
from Wichita.

Why am I listed as your
executive assistant?

Because the word "secretary"
has fallen into disrepute.

FYI, my mother's
birthday is coming up.

I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

Okay, we need
to stop for a minute.

Leonard, please,
we can talk during our break.

We have one coming up
at midnight.

We'll need snacks.

Sheldon, you're not in charge.

It's my idea.
I'm in charge.

Oh, of course you are.

Look at the organizational
chart.

You're clearly listed
as founder.

Well, yes, and you're listed

as Chief Executive Officer,

Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

You missed
Chief Science Officer,

Chairman of the Board, and Head
of the Secret Santa Committee.

Okay.

You need to get clear
on this right now.

I am in charge of this project.

Ooh. Leonard's going all
alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

All right. All right,
I'm not going to argue with you.

Sheldon Cooper is nothing
if not a team player.

Dr. Hofstadter,
you have the conn.

Thank you.

I thought we might start

by talking
about the user interface.

Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

So this button here

will allow you
to scan a new equation,

but over here,
you can press this,

and just substitute new values
for the coefficients.

Good one, boss.

What?

This diagram.

I assume
you were opening with a joke.

It certainly buoyed up
this employee's esprit de corps.

It's not a joke.
It's the real design.

In that case, may I offer
27 little tweaks

to make it
slightly less embarrassing?

Sheldon, I think
this will work.

Let's just try it my way.

Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

I assumed that you wanted

candid truth-telling
from your employees,

but I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering

of complacent
yes-men.

Are you done?

If you say so, boss.

So right now,
this button-press event

is just triggering
a dummy procedure call...

How about this
for the app name?

The Surprisingly
Helpful Equation-Linked

Differential
Optimized Numerator.

So it spells "Sheldon."

Does it?

A happy accident.

We're not doing
names now. Howard?

Like I was saying, right now
it's just a dummy procedure,

but eventually,
it will drop us into...

All right, fine.

If we're not going
to give it a name,

can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

- No.
- Hear me out.

The atomic bomb
was The Manhattan Project.

Windows 95 was originally
Project Chicago.

For our app, I would humbly
suggest Project Nodlehs.

That's just
"Sheldon" backwards.

Another happy accident.

We're not wasting time
with names right now.

I see.

Is that decision open
for discussion?

No.

Is the decision to not
discuss it open for discussion?

No.

Again,

right now it's just
a dummy procedure,

but eventually,
it will drop us into...

I call for a vote
of no confidence

and an immediate change
in leadership.

Sheldon, stop it.

When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

to dissolve the bonds

that tie three competent
scientists together...

That's enough, Sheldon.
All right, let's get right to the vote.

Show of hands--
all those opposed

to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny.

Okay, that's it, you're fired.

Really?

Why?

Because you're impossible
to work with.

I see.

And is that open
for discussion?

What are you doing?

Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

I think you'll be pleased

with what the elves were up to
last night.

But I fired you.

Oh, I know. I'm now
an independent contractor.

No, you are
now nothing.

You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

But I made it better.

I don't want it better.
I want it my way.

Well, that speaks volumes,
doesn't it?

All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

What the hell are bus pants?

They are pants one wears
over one's regular pants

when one sits on bus seats

that other people
have previously sat on.

But perhaps
from your lofty heights

atop the corporate ladder,
you've lost touch

with the struggles
of the common man.

Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

Nothing's changed
in that regard.

We're still roommates,
we're still friends.

Except you identified me,
your best friend,

as a gangrenous limb
that needed to be severed

from the organism
and tossed away.

The desperate act
of a little man

with a big Napoleon complex.

You know what?

Go put on your bus pants.

Mm. Last night,
I had a dream

we got so rich from the app,

you and I bought matching
side-by-side mansions.

But...

there was a secret tunnel

connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

What do you think that means?

It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

Good morning, Friend Howard.

Friend Raj.

I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.

"World's Greatest
Astrophysicist"?

Don't thank me. You earned it.

"Howard Wolowitz."

Why not
"World's Greatest Engineer"?

I'm sorry.

I typed that
into the label maker,

but I just couldn't press enter.

Now down to business.

What would it take for you
to abandon Leonard

and join me in a rival company?

Unless, of course,
the mugs are sufficient,

in which case, welcome aboard.

We're not quitting on Leonard.

I understand.
Your loyalty is admirable.

But what if I were
to up the ante?

What are you talking about?

Monogrammed key chains

with a built-in laser pointer.

No?

How about can cozies

emblazoned
with our university mascot?

Go, Beavers.

I'll be back.

Okay, let's try this one.

"Spherical Hankel function."

Hold on.

That's it!

Eureka!

Hey, we agreed when
it was "Eureka" time,

we were all gonna
say it together.

Fine.

Let's say it together.

No. The moment
has passed.

Greetings, gentlemen.

How goes your
little project?

You mean,
"Project Lenwoloppali"?

Ah, a combination
of all your names.

Very clever.

I assume "Koothranardowitz"
was taken?

We're actually
scanning equations

and getting good results.

Oh, well then,
by all means, carry on.

I wouldn't want
to impede your progress.

Howard, did you solve
the install time problem yet?

No. It's a little tricky.

I'm gonna try having it pick up
the libraries dyn...

What are you doing?!

Playing the theremin.

No. I mean, what are you
doing with a theremin?

Playing it.

I've loved the theremin
from the first moment

I heard the original
<i>Star Trek</i> theme.

And it's been killing me

that it just sits in my closet,
gathering dust.

Sheldon!
We're working here!

That's all right.

I can barely hear you
over my theremin.

Well, that was a
little uncalled for.

No, that was
completely called for.

We need quiet.

So, your project is more
important than mine?

Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.

Don't beat around the bush,
Leonard.

If you don't want me here,

just say the word,
and I'll leave.

Could have beaten
around the bush a little.

âª Nobody knows âª

âª The trouble I've seen âª

âª Nobody knows my sorrow âª

âª Oh, oh, oh. âª

What you doing?

Trying to contact
your home planet?

I'm practicing my theremin.

Oh.

âª Nobody knows âª

âª The trouble I've seen âª

âª Glory, hallelujah. âª

Something got you down,
there, Sheldon?

Leonard kicked me out
of my own apartment.

And his app team.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

He wouldn't drive me
to work today.

I had to wear
my bus pants.

- Is that so?
- Yes.

And they're
still sticky.

Aw...

Probably going to have
to throw them away.

Hey, you don't need
Leonard and his app.

You can make one with me.

With you?

Seriously,
I have a great idea for one.

Is it better than your idea
to move to Los Angeles

and become a famous actress?

Okay, look...

when you see someone
wearing shoes you like,

you just snap a picture of them,

and the app goes on the Internet

to find out
where you can buy them.

That's your app idea?

Well, you don't like it?

I didn't say that.
But no, I don't.

Why not?

Oh, Penny,
where do I begin?

The simple-mindedness
of your idea

is exceeded only by its
crass consumerism and banality.

And Leonard didn't want
to work with you?

Imagine that.

I know, it's baffling.

âª Nobody knows âª

âª The trouble I've seen... âª

Sheldon, I'm gonna
make some cocoa.

Do you want some?

Do you make it
with milk or water?

- Milk.
- Real cocoa?

That's what it says
on the packet.

Do you have
those little marshmallows?

No, sorry.

Well, I suppose
it's appropriate.

What does that mean?

A disappointing drink
for a disappointing day.

Hey, look at this.

20 people from the university
have already signed up

for our private beta.

I'm telling you,

the Lenwoloppali
Differential Equation Scanner

meets a real need.
We've got a hit.

What do you think we
should sell it for?

Well, based on the fact
that our potential market

is about 70 or 80 guys,

and you want a submarine,

I'd say about a
million dollars a pop.

Well, what if we put out a lite
version for half a million?

You know,
get the word of mouth going.

Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

but you've got to come
take your Sheldon back.

What's he doing
in your apartment?

Well, he was moping down in the
lobby, so I invited him over.

Now I regret it.

Why do you regret...
Uh, never mind, stupid question.

Look, can't you just let him
play with you until bedtime?

We're not playing.

This is real work.

We're going to
be hundred-aires.

Okay. What if I got him
to apologize

and promise to behave?

Then I guess we would
let him back on the app team,

and while we're doing that,
you could take an aerial tour

of L.A. on your flying pig.

Okay. Wait right here.

I'll tell you one thing.
If I get rich enough,

that's the kind of girl I want
to take on a submarine ride.

And yes, that time,
I meant it to be dirty.

Really?

Leonard wants me back?

Oh, yes. He says they
are lost without you.

Well, we sure saw that coming.

That's right.

You know what
I'm going to do?

I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

No, no, no. You know,

they have
suffered enough.

Everybody's
suffered enough.

The thing is, you're going
to have to offer him

a face-saving
way out of this.

How?

Say you're sorry.

Oh, no.

Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

Okay. Um...

How about this? You know
how you're always trying

to learn about sarcasm?

No.
No?

I was being sarcastic.

Oh. Good for you.

So all you have to do here
is say you're sorry to Leonard,

but say it
sarcastically.

Of course.

He will hear it as an attempt
to mend fences,

as opposed
to the withering condemnation

you and I will know it to be.

Yeah. Yeah, that
was my plan.

All right.
Come on. Let's go.

Oh, by the way,
thank you

for the delicious cocoa.

Oh, you're welcome.

Boy, I'm getting
good at this.

Okay, now that you're
back on the team,

let's get you caught up.

Before you begin,
let me say again

how deeply sorry I am
for my earlier behavior

and how much I respect
and admire your leadership.

Thank you.

So as you can see,

not only can you store
your favorite equations,

but you can forward them
to your friends

or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

Thanks.

You all have clearly put
in a lot of hard work.

We have.

As a result,
you have taken

the most important step
on the road to success:

learning what not to do.

Now, let's start fresh.

Howard, we're going
to need some tea.

Okay, these are Uggs.

These are Crocs.

These are knockoff
Manolo Blahniks.

Bored.

Look, you said it yourself,
we have to create a database

before you can write
an alga-thingy.

Algorithm.

You see, Penny, Alan Turing
defined an algorithm...

Bored.

Okay.

These are Steve Maddens.

These are Nine West.

These are Target. Oh, but don't
they look like Chanel?

These are
Michael Kors...

Hey. So you guys ready
to order?

Since we come in
every Tuesday night at 6:00

and order the same exact thing,
and it's now 6:08,

I believe your question
not only answers itself

but also stands alongside
such other nonsensical queries

as "Who let the dogs out?"
and, uh, "How are they hanging""

Okay.

So, the usual, with extra spit
on Sheldon's hamburger.

Penny, a moment?

Do you have plans
this weekend?

Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry,

I'm actually pretty busy
this weekend.

Probably serving food
that was ordered today.

That's too bad. I was hoping
you could be my plus-one

at the Institute
of Interdisciplinary Studies'

symposium on the impact
of current scientific research

on societal interactions.

The what?

It's an annual
science conference.

We've all been invited to speak.

Oh! Oh, okay, well, you know,
like I said, I have plans, so...

Shame. Since you're
my best friend,

I thought it would be
a good bonding opportunity.

I'm your best friend?

Don't you read my blog?

Oh, don't feel bad.

I never read Leonard's, and
I used to sleep with him.

Do you know anybody else
who would appreciate

an all-expense-paid spa weekend

at a four-star resort
in Big Sur?

No, I really-- I'm sorry,
free what? Sorry, what, what?

I think her weekend
just opened up.

Wait, wait, just to be clear,
when you guys say "spa,"

does that mean the same thing
as when regular people say it?

Pretty much.

Except we keep
our shirts on in the sauna.

You know, it is going
to be difficult,

but I'm going to cancel my plans
so I can do this for my bestie.

Please don't touch my breasts.

I... I wasn't going to.

All right. I just want
to establish boundaries.

Boy, this is great. I haven't
had a vacation in ages.

In order to take a vacation,
one first has to work.

You know, for a smart guy,

you really seem to have a
hard time grasping the concept

"don't piss off the people
who handle the things you eat."

That does seem to be
a valid principle.

I trust Penny will adhere to

the "Official California
Restaurant Workers'

Solemn Oath of Ethics
and Cleanliness."

I don't believe
there's any such thing.

You lied to me?

<i>Good morning.</i>

If I could have everyone's
attention, please?

I know we're all eager
to get on the road to Big Sur,

so if we focus, I'm sure we can
get through this orientation

in under a half an hour.

Then it's just Q&A,
quiz, safety drills,

pose for commemorative
group photo and we're off.

Don't worry. Just sit
next to me during the quiz,

and you can copy my answers.

Raj?

What are you doing?

I don't think so.

You've had your allotted
six ounces.

The first bathroom break
isn't until the Denny's

located near Bakersfield,

which is approximately
two and half hours away.

Remember, people, we're only as
strong as our weakest bladder.

Nobody cares about
your Kegel exercises.

All right. We have
seven people, and two cars.

In the lead car,
driven by Leonard,

will be... myself,

Amy Farrah Fowler,

and Penny.

Yes!

He had you in the other car,
but I got you upgraded.

Yay!

She made the case
that if we break down

in the middle of nowhere,
your Nebraska backwoods skills

and brawny hands
will give us the best chance

to survive in the wild.

Brawny?

They're bigger
than mine.

Red Leader to Red Five,
come in.

Red Leader to Red Five,
come in.

Howard, you promised.

WOLOWITZ
Fine. Red Five to Red Leader.

What do you want now?

It's 11:15. I'm requesting your
quarter-hourly location update.

Still right behind you.

Copy that, Red Five.

Radio contact is sufficient.

No need to extend
your middle finger.

So, Amy, I've
been wondering,

are you and Sheldon going
to be sharing a room?

No, we discussed it.

We decided we didn't want
to jeopardize our relationship

by getting to know
each other too well.

Indeed. Nothing sours
a friendship more

than over-familiarity
with someone's toilet routine.

I can vouch for that.

Hey.
Not you, him.

Oh. Thanks.

Although yours
was an eye-opener.

Don't worry, Penny.

You're my plus-one.
You'll bunk with me.

And FYI, travel
makes me constipated,

so I'm the ideal
hotel roommate.

Terrific.

Are we there yet?

I hope we get there in time
to see the keynote address.

Really? You want to see
the keynote?

Yeah, it sounds fun.

"Super bacteria:

global apocalypse or
exciting research opportunity?"

Actually, I was thinking we
could go straight to the room

and... take a nap.

Really?

And miss the keynote?

We can watch it later on C-SPAN.

Besides, I was really
looking forward to you and me...

napping together in the hotel.

Honey, if you're
that tired,

why don't you just take
a nap here in the car?

No, see, it's not...

Hang on.
It's Leonard.

Hi, Leonard.

LEONARD
Yeah, hi. Listen, I just
got a text from Raj.

He wanted me to tell you

that when Howard says "nap,"
he means "sex."

Thank you, Raj.

Are you... an element
in the actinoid series?

No.

Amy?

Are you usually radioactive
when found in nature?

No.

Are you in the
lanthanoid series?

Amy, it's Penny's turn.

Penny?

Uh, I don't know...

Are you food?

That's not apropos.

We've already established
I'm found in the periodic table.

Well, it's a table, right?

I mean, why can't there
be food on it?

I knew she wasn't
lead car materiel.

Who elected you
Road Trip God?

Leonard.

It was a late-night vote.

We were all exhausted,

and he was threatening
to filibuster.

It's not technically
"Road Trip God""

it's Travel Supervisor.

Although Road Trip God
does have a certain ring to it.

I don't understand
why you people

just let him bully
you like this.

Someone should
stand up to him.

What's he going to do?

I can't believe you let him
kick me out of the car.

What could we do?
He's the Travel Supervisor.

Don't worry, Penny.
This is a better car anyway.

Yeah. It's the Love Car.

Should I ask?

âª They say we're young
and we don't know âª

âª We won't find out
until we grow âª

âª Well, I don't know
if all that's true âª

âª 'Cause you got me,
and, baby, I got you âª

âª Babe âª
âª Mm da-da,
da-da, da-da âª

âª I got you, babe âª

Red Leader, I'm really sorry.

âª I got you, babe. âª

WOLOWITZ AND BERNADETTE:
âª I got you, babe... âª

I missed you.

You know what?
I missed you, too.

Bernadette?

Oh, my God, Glenn!

Great to see you!

Are you here
for the conference?

Yeah, I'm doing
a global warming panel.

Oh, good for you.

Uh, Glenn,
this is my boyfriend Howard.

Nice to meet you.
Hi.

Ow. Hi.

You're a lucky man.

Bernie's
a great gal.

Yes. "Bernie" sure is.

Well, I got to run.
The panel's tomorrow morning.

It's called, "Remembering Snow:
A Look Back."

I'll try to catch it.

Oh, great.

Bye.
Bye.

Hey... Bernie?

Yeah?

Please tell me he's
your gay cousin.

No.

He was one of my professors
in college.

Oh! That's a relief.

Then we went out
for a year.

Come on, let's check in,
so we can take that nap.

No, it's not necessarily
proportional...

Shut up!

That green bag
is Dr. Cooper's.

Here's an extra five.
Make him wait.

Oh.

Right to the nap, huh? Okay.

Uh, so, this Glenn guy.

You say you went out with
him for, like, a year.

Do we really need to talk
about my old boyfriend now?

No. I guess not.

What is he, like,
six-four, six-five?

Six-seven.

Probably has a hard time
finding a suit that fits.

Is something
bothering you?

No. It's just...
What?

I'm just thinking.

If you had sex with that guy,

I mean, there's nothing
I can do here

that will make
any kind of... impact.

Howard, it's not a contest.

I love you.
I want to be with you.

Yeah, great, love you, too,
but...

If it were a contest,

I wouldn't have a chance, right?

You can't think
that way.

Yep.

Loser.

Howard, stop it.

Sorry. I just
never figured that

a guy like me going out
with a girl like you

would ever have to compete
with a guy like that.

Wait a minute, "a girl like me"?
What's that mean?

I'm... I...

Are you saying you
don't think I'm hot enough

to go out with a guy like Glenn?

No! No, I'm saying
exactly the opposite.

I'm <i>too</i> hot to go out
with a guy like Glenn?

Yeah, let's go with that.

Still nothing.

Remind me to try again
in an hour.

Will do.

So...

girl talk?

Um, sure.

What do you got in mind?

Do you subscribe to the Freudian
theory of penis envy?

Um, I never really
thought about it.

Why?

Sometimes I think it might be
nice to have one.

Really?

Not for sex, for convenience.

You can't deny that,
by comparison,

our internal plumbing
is extremely high maintenance.

Again, I've never given
it much thought.

We have time now.

Think about it.

Oh, good.

Hey.

Can I stay here tonight?

Yeah. Why, what happened?

Howard's a complete
and total ass.

Oh, yeah, that.
Come on in.

Thanks. I'll sleep
on the floor.

Not necessary.

Penny and I are perfectly
comfortable sharing a bed.

We are?

Of course, we're best friends.

Oh, right, right, the blog.

Word of warning, though.

I'm prone to night terrors,

so when I wake up kicking
and screaming, don't panic.

Just pin me down and stroke
my hair, and I'll be fine.

Hey, can I stay here tonight?
Shh-shh-shh.

Sheldon's asleep.

What's going on?

Well, Howard's a complete
and total ass,

Bernadette's in my bed,

and no matter how much you
stroke Amy's hair, she bites.

What?
Never mind.

Can I stay here or not?

Uh, sure.
All right.

So, how do you want
to do this?

Well, I'm not getting
in bed with <i>him.</i>

Yeah, it is
a little like

getting into
Dracula's coffin.

We're just gonna have
to make the best of this.

Okay, when you say
"make the best of it..."

Sleep.
Right.

So we'll just call
the middle here

the Neutral Zone.

The what?

<i>Star Trek.</i>

You know, the
Neutral Zone

between the Federation
and the Romulan Empire.

Oh, okay.

Just like old times.

Of course,

sometimes the Federation
and the Romulans

would enter
the Neutral Zone

to negotiate a
temporary truce.

Sweetie, let me put this
in a way you'll understand:

from the waist down,
my shields are up.

Got it, got it.

We can do all
kinds of stuff

from the waist up,
you know?

Go to sleep.
Good night.

Please tell me
you're not having coitus.

We are not having coitus.

Can you guarantee
that it won't happen

at any time during the night?

Yes.
No.

ANNOUNCER
Next on Turner Classic Movies,
<i>Bridget Jones's Diary.</i>

Oh, my God, I'm crying already.

Raj? Raj?

Raj?

I need to sleep
here tonight.

Why?

Howard is a complete
and total ass,

Bernadette is in Penny's
bed, Amy bites,

and Penny may or may not
have coitus with Leonard.

Okay. Come on in.

Leonard, are you asleep?

No.

I really appreciate you letting
me stay here tonight.

Sure, no problem.

I know it's kinda weird.

True dat.

"True dat"?

I've gotten a lot more street
since we broke up.

Right.

Still mad at me about that?

No. No, I understand.

I got too intense,
you had to back off.

Thank you.

I've gotten a lot better
at that, you know.

I've dated four different women
since we broke up

and I didn't tell any of them
that I loved them

and wanted
to have their babies.

Good for you.

Okay, good night.

Good night.

You know, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world

to violate the Neutral Zone
for just one night.

Oh!

Hey, Leonard,
Sheldon kicked me

out of the room,
gave me your key.

Penny's here.

No, we don't want to watch
Bridget Jones's Diary!

Good morning and welcome
to Science and Society.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS,
MA, PhD, and ScD.

OMG, right?

Perhaps that joke was a little
too hippie-dippy for this crowd.

All right then, we'll begin
with opening remarks.

Miss Rostenkowski,
would you like to start us off

by discussing
your assessment

of science's responsibility
to society?

Sure.

I think all branches
of science

have to move cautiously
these days.

It's not just giant
nuclear weapons

that can destroy
the world.

As a microbiologist,
I can tell you

even the tiniest organisms
can still tear you a new one.

Interesting.

I think what you might need
to know about my colleague

is that though she claims
her field of interest  is tiny organisms,

she certainly has spent
her fair share of time

around what we can assume was
pretty massive weaponry.

I think Mr. Wolowitz
needs to keep in mind

that the past
is the past.

But he should know
that I <i>am</i> the kind of girl

who could get <i>all</i>
the giant missiles she wants.

Are we talking about women
wanting penises?

Because I'd like to weigh in.

Dr. Koothrappali, would you care
to join the conversation?

Certainly.
I'd like to raise two points.

Number one, I think they <i>are</i>
talking about penises.

And number two, these mimosas
are kicking my little brown ass.

I'd like to kick
your little brown ass.

What did I do?

Oh, I don't know.

Maybe when you walk
into a hotel room

and you see a guy getting back
together with his girlfriend,

you should consider doing
something other

than crawling into
the adjoining bed.

I did. You said no
<i>Bridget Jones.</i>

We weren't getting
back together!

It was a one-time thing!

Excuse me.

We're not taking comments
or questions

from the audience just yet.

Oh, shut up, Sheldon!

Hi, bestie.

All right,

why don't we see if we can bring
this back to topic.

Let me ask you
something, Bernie.

I guess not.

How would you feel if
you met <i>my</i> ex-girlfriend

and she was like
Angelina Jolie?

Oh, come on, Howard,
be realistic.

What, I'm not hot enough
for Angelina Jolie?

I'd like to weigh in here.

No.

All right,
why don't we open it up

to Q&A from the audience?

Yeah, I have a question.

Is there anybody who can get me
the hell out of here

and back to Los Angeles
tonight?

I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.

Penny, that's Glenn.
Glenn, that's Penny.

No!

SHELDON
Red Leader to Red Five.

Red Leader
to Red Five.

Anybody up for a little game?

I spy with my little eye...

a nonferrous metal.

Must be out of range.

Leonard, can I ask you
a question?

Sure.

Are you bothered by the fact
that your former girlfriend

left the symposium
with what is probably

the most beautiful man
I've ever seen in my life?

No. Why do you ask?

Because we're going
120 miles per hour.

All right, if no one's going
to guess...

I was spying the aluminum rims
on the police car

we passed a few miles back.

Good evening.

I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

I was expecting applause,

but I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

I agreed to speak
to you this evening,

because I was told that you're
the best and the brightest

of this university's
doctoral candidates.

Hmm. Of course,
that's like saying

you are the most important
electron in a hydrogen atom.

'Cause, you see,

there's only one electron
in a hydrogen atom.

Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

All right, let's begin.

Show of hands,
who here is familiar

with the concept
of topological insulators?

Don't kid yourselves.

I found another tweet from a
student at Sheldon's lecture.

"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject

"and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

Plus, he looks
like a giant insect."

Look. Listen to this one.

"Does Einstein's theory
explain why time flies

"when you're having fun,

"but when you're listening
to Dr. Cooper,

it falls out of the sky, dead?"

Ooh, somebody took pictures

and uploaded them
to their Flickr account.

Wow.

How do you get an
entire lecture hall

to flip you off
at the same time?

Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

all you need
to do is turn your back.

Hey, Leonard,
is your wi-fi down?

I can't get on.

Oh, Sheldon changed
the password.

It's now
"Penny is a freeloader."

No spaces.

Thanks.
What are you guys doing?

Sheldon gave a lecture
at the university tonight.

We're reading
the reviews.

Oh. How'd he do?

Well, picture the Hindenburg
meets Chernobyl

meets Three Mile Island
meets <i>Tron 2.</i>

That bad, huh?

Read this woman's tweet.

"Listening to Dr. Cooper

has made me want to start
cutting myself again""

Yeah.

Good evening,
Leonard, Howard, Raj,

freeloader.

So, how'd the lecture go?

In a word, triumphant.

Really? Triumphant?

Oh, yes, you should have
seen those young people.

Thirsty for knowledge,
drinking in my wisdom.

I may have changed
a few lives today.

Oh, please let
me tell him.

I don't know,
I kind of promised Howard.

Tell me what?

Actually, we should
all share the moment.

Raj, if you would.

Oh, tweets about my lecture.

Hmm...

That's rather unfair.

That's downright cruel.

Plus, insects
have six legs.

Yeah, I'm not familiar
with the acronym "KMN""

From the context, we think
it means "kill me now."

Well, I suppose everyone's
entitled to their own opinion.

I think I'll turn in.

I didn't want to teach
those poopy heads, anyway.

FYI, I think that's
what Darth Vader said

just before he started
building the Death Star.

Sheldon still moping?

Yeah, it's weird.
Even though he didn't want

to give the lecture
in the first place,

being rejected by those students
really hit him hard.

I know the feeling.

It's like accidentally
walking into a gay bar

and then having
no one hit on you.

It-It happened
to a friend of mine.

Are you guys doing okay?

Leonard and I are fine,

but I think Raj needs
to meet a girl really soon.

Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

He's such a cutie.

Thank you,
but "cute" is for bunnies.

I want to be something
with sex appeal,

like...
like a labradoodle.

Labradoodle?

We might be starting
to zero in on your problem.

Don't you listen to them.

You've got plenty
of sex appeal.

You really think so?

Yeah. You're a hottie.

Well, thanks, Bernadette.

And just for the record,

labradoodles are
hypo-allergenic,

which is a very sexy quality to
those troubled by animal dander.

AMY
So, what do you think?

It's a charming illusion,
but it does not cheer me up.

Not even when I do this?

No.

Well, that was the last arrow
in my quiver of whimsy.

Do you realize that teaching
is the first thing

I've failed at
since my ill-fated attempt

to complete a chin-up
in March of 1989?

If this humiliating experience

is really troubling you,

there are things
we could do about it.

For instance?

Well, the first thing
that comes to mind

is isolating the part
of your brain

where the memory is stored
and destroying it with a laser.

Hmm, no.

One slip of the hand,

and suddenly I'm sitting
in the Engineering Department,

building doodads with Wolowitz.

All right.

Have you considered improving
your socialization skills,

thus allowing you

to communicate more
effectively with other people?

Isn't that their burden?

I'm the one with something
interesting to say.

Fair enough, but in its essence,

teaching is a performance art.

In the classroom paradigm,

the teacher has the
responsibility to communicate,

as well as entertain and engage.

I sense that you're trying
to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

Would you mind very much
jumping to it?

Perhaps you should consider
taking acting lessons.

Acting lessons.

Interesting.

It might help
if I could act as though I care

about my students
and whether or not they learn.

Penny.

Penny. Penny.

What?

You're an "actress," correct?

I'm not an "actress."

I'm an actress.

All right.

You're an actress.

I need you to teach me.

You want an acting lesson?

Perhaps two. I'd like
to master the craft.

Okay, where
is this coming from?

It has been suggested to
me that acting techniques

could improve my
lecturing, at which,

if certain tweets and
blogs are to be believed,

I "suck the big one."

Yeah, I saw those.
They were funny.

I printed a few out
and put 'em on my fridge.

So, when could we start?

Okay, just to be clear.

You are asking me for help
because I know something

that the brilliant
Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

I suppose that's one
way to look at it.

I think it's the only
way to look at it.

Are you going to
help me or not?

Probably. I'm just
enjoying the foreplay.

Does this mean you are done
mocking my acting career?

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
making the transition

from actor to acting teacher

was the signal
that one's career

had reached the
end of the road.

Forget it.

I'll pay you $40.

Saturday, 9:00 a.m.
Bring cash.

Raj, I have amazing news!

What?

I just got offered
a fellowship

at the Weitzmann
Institute in Israel.

Dude, that's incredible!
I know.

The only thing is, I'm
gonna be gone for two years.

Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

Are you going with him?

I have to stay
here for school.

That's what we're here
to talk to you about.

You see,
Bernadette has needs.

What kind of needs?

Sexual needs.

Most of them regular,

some of them
kind of messed up.

So, while I'm gone,

you're going
to have to satisfy her.

What do you say?

I say okey-dokey.

What ya thinking
so hard about?

Just that
I'm definitely not gay.

SHELDON
Penny!

Penny! Penny!

What's wrong?

Nothing.
I was acting.

You were acting.

Yes. In preparation
for today's studies,

I read Stanislavski's
<i>An Actor Prepares,</i>

Stella Adler's
<i>The Technique of Acting,</i>

Uta Hagen's
<i>Respect for Acting,</i>

and Henry Winkler's
<i>Ayyy, I'm an Actor.</i>

Well, good for you.

Come on in.

How shall we begin?

Well, I thought we'd start

with some
basic movement exercises.

You know, get our bodies
warmed up a little.

All right.

So I just want you to relax

and kind of
move around in the space.

You know,
just do whatever feels natural.

Sheldon?

You said to do whatever
feels natural.

This feels natural.

Certainly more natural

than what you're doing.

Come on,
you got to work with me.

We need to get connected
with our bodies.

Penny, my body and I have
a relationship

that works best
when we maintain a cool,

wary distance from each other.

All right,
let's just say we've warmed up.

You're the "teacher."

Okay. One of the things
that might help you

in connecting with your students

is being
a little more spontaneous.

So why don't we
try some improvisation?

Why not?
It seems like

you're improvising
your entire curriculum.

This is all about
listening and responding.

Gotcha.

I'm going to create a character

and a situation, and you
just jump in when you feel it.

All right.
All right.

Action.

Okay, it's not a movie.

It's improv.
So no one calls "action."

Hey, you taught me something.

Who would have thought it?

Okay.

Uh, no, the shipment
has not arrived,

and I really need those shoes.

They are my biggest seller.

Yes, ladies sizes six
through ten.

Thank you.
Oh, sorry.

I have to go.
I have a customer. Bye-bye.

Hi. Can I help you?

I'd like a frozen yogurt,
please.

Yogurt?

Yeah.
Um...

Okay, sure.

Luckily, we sell both shoes
and yogurt here.

You do?

Yes. Look up at the sign,

and remember, improv is always
about saying yes.

All right.

Yes.

I see a sign.

It says "Camarillo State
Mental Hospital."

What?

It's the only explanation
I can come up with

for why you think
you sell shoes and yogurt.

Okay, you know what?

Let's just try
a different improv. Uh..

Oh, this time
we will be two winos

living under a freeway overpass.

Oh, and we're going
to use props?

You bet.

I had dreams,
you know.

I was gonna be famous.

Show everybody back home
I could be someone.

Now look at me.

Want some?

You have any frozen yogurt?

I'm still not adjusted

to how the SyFy channel
spells their name now.

S-y-F-y.
That's "siffy."

Uh-huh.

Hello?

Oh, my God! Is he okay?

What happened?
Hang on. Hang on.

Uh-huh.

Okay, thank you.

Howard was on his scooter,
and got hit by a truck.

He's in critical condition.

Oh, no!

Did you hear?

Isn't it terrible?

Have you seen him?

They wouldn't let me in.

Oh, my Howie.

It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

It'll be okay.

It'll be
okay.

It's Howard.

Howard, hello.

Raj, is that you?

Yeah, I'm right here,
buddy. How are you?

Shh, shh. Listen to me.

I'm not gonna make it.

No, no, no,
don't say that.

You're going to
be all right.

Raj, I don't have time.
Now, pay attention.

My last wish is that
you look after Bernadette.

Of course, of course.

Now when you say "look
after," you mean...

Sexually.

Excuse me, Bernadette.
I have to hear it from him.

Sexually.

Got it. Take care.

I guess I have no choice

but to make sweet,
guilt-free love to you

over and over again
for the rest of my life.

That's how I heard it.

Or it could be "sy-fee."

What?

S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

Oh, right.

Good one.

So, did you get a chance
to go over the scene I gave you?

Yes. I didn't care for it.

Okay, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>
is an American classic.

So is the McRib sandwich.

I don't care
for that, either.

Fine. What would you rather do
as a scene study?

I'm glad you asked.

I took the liberty

of adapting a <i>Star Trek</i>
fan fiction novella

I wrote when I was ten

into a one-act play.

And you think it's better
than Tennessee Williams?

Why don't we leave that for
future generations to decide?

<i>Where No Sheldon</i>
<i>Has Gone Before.</i>

It's the story of a young boy
who is transported

from the ignorant backwoods
of East Texas

to the 23rd Century,

where his genius is not only
appreciated, but celebrated.

KMN...

Now, in this
pivotal scene,

Sheldon's mother, played by you,
argues with an emissary

of the United Federation
of Planets, Mr. Spock,

the role I will bring to life.

Okay, that's fine,
but let's try

and get you out
of your comfort zone.

Why would we want to do that?

It's called "the comfort zone"
for a reason.

Okay, the whole point of this is
to loosen you up a little,

so I'm thinking you'll play
the role of your mother,

and I will bring life
to Mr. Spock.

I'm sorry.

You'll be Spock?

It's only logical.

Very well.

I'll set the scene.

All right.

"East Texas.

"A warm summer night.

"A woman, Mary,

"stands on a porch.

In the distance, we hear a
lonesome train whistle..."

"The droning buzz of cicadas..""

"A coyote howls at the moon,

frightening sensitive young boys
everywhere."

"Out in the woods,

an owl screeches..."
Okay, okay.

We get it.
You set the scene.

Hoo!

Now just read
your mother's line.

"Shelly!

"Shelly, how many times
have I told you

"not to leave your sciencey
stuff out on the porch?

"Goodness,

"I'll never understand that boy.

"But then again,
I'm a religious nut,

and my mind is closed
to so many things."

"Spock to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Transport successful."

"Glory be to Heaven,

"some sort of creature
just manifested out of thin air.

"George, put down that Pepsi can
full of bourbon

that ain't foolin' no one,
and get your shotgun!"

"Greetings, Mary Cooper.

I am Spock."

I'm sorry.
I just don't buy it.

Just keep going!

"Oh, my, your sudden appearance
startles me."

"We have been monitoring
your son Sheldon

"from the 23rd Century, and

"we have determined
that he is now ready

"to join us.

"His unique genius
is our best hope

for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

"I understand.

"Oh, Shelly?

"A man's here
to take you away to the future!

Be sure to pack
clean underwear."

Okay, okay, let's try
that last line again,

and this time,
maybe try choking up

a little.
Why?

Well, you're losing your son.

Yes, but he's going
to a better place

where he won't get beat up...
so much.

All right, come on,
just try it my way.

Pretend you're sad
to see him go.

I'm gonna lead you in.

"His unique genius
is our best hope

for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

- That's your cue.
- I'm sorry. I just love that line.

Even the way you do it.

All right, come on, come on.

Put some real emotion into it.

Blah-blah, blah, blah...
"vast and troubled galaxy."

Go.
Hmm.

"Oh, Shelly?

A man's here
to take you away to the future""

"Be sure to pack clean
underwear."

That's good. That's good.
That's good.

Mommy, why are you crying?

'Cause I'm gonna
miss you, Shelly-bean,

even though you creep
the bugeeses out of me.

Okay, I guess
we're improvising now.

I'm sorry.

It's not my fault.

I'm just incredibly smart,

and everyone around here is
dumber than a bag of rocks.

Oh, now, don't
you start crying.

You get in that spaceship.

Mommy's late for
Indian bingo.

Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny.

Yeah, I think I broke your son.

Hey, hold on.

Talk to your mother.

Mommy, I love you.

Don't let Spock take
me to the future!

Okay, Raj,

I know you've been avoiding me
and Howard, and I'm not leaving

until you tell me
what's going on

inside that little head
of yours.

âª Like the wild elephant âª

âª I am trumpeting
my love for you! âª

âª Like a hidden flower âª

âª My sweet fragrance
comes into view! âª

âª My heart burns for you
like the sun at noon! âª

âª My desert welcomes you
like the rainy monsoon! âª

âª You are my heart! âª

âª My universe! âª

âª You are my heart! âª

âª My universe! âª

âª <i>Hey!</i> âª

âª You are my heart! âª

âª My universe! âª

âª You are my heart! âª

âª My universe! âª

âª You are my heart! âª

âª My universe! âª

Dance number aside,
I'm so not gay.

Here's what I wonder
about zombies.

What happens if they can't get
any human flesh to eat?

They can't starve to death--
they're already dead.

You take this one.
I spent an hour last night on

"How do vampires shave

when they can't see
themselves in the mirror"?

Well-groomed vampires
meet in pairs

and shave each other--
case closed.

Yeah, okay, so, zombies.

I guess it depends
on the zombies, Raj.

Are we talking slow zombies,
fast zombies?

Like, in <i>28 Days,</i>
<i>if those zombies didn't eat,</i>

they starved.
You're thinking

of <i>28 Days Later.</i>

<i>28 Days</i> is where
Sandra Bullock goes to rehab

and puts the audience
into an undead state

Hey, don't bag
on Sandra Bullock!

You think it makes you
look cultured,

but you just
come off as bitter.

Oh, Dr. Siebert,
twelve o'clock.

Why's the president
of the university

slumming in the cafeteria?

Perhaps he's emulating
Shakespeare's Henry V,

who dressed as a commoner
and mingled among them,

to find out how he was being
perceived by his subjects.

Of course, if he'd

have read any
of the 1,300 e-mails

I've sent him on the subject
of his administration,

he could have saved himself
the trouble.

Or maybe he heard it's
Tator Tot Tuesday.

That's why I'm here.

Hey, there's
my favorite geniuses!

How are we doing today?

That depends--
how much longer

do you plan on
fondling my shoulder?

Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot
you have a touch phobia.

It's not a touch phobia,
it's a germ phobia.

If you'd like to go put on
a pair of latex gloves,

I'll let you check me
for a hernia.

Yeah.

So, listen, fellas, who's up
for a little party this Saturday night?

Open bar, good eats, might
even be a few pretty girls.

Sounds great!
I'm in!

Hold on.

Just because the nice man
is offering you candy,

doesn't mean you should jump
into his windowless van.

What's the occasion?

Just a little fund-raiser
for the university.

Aha! The tear-stained air
mattress in the back of the van.

I understand
your reticence, Dr. Cooper,

and I sympathize,
but the hard facts are,

occasionally,
we have to shake a few hands

and kiss a few butts
to raise money for our research.

I don't care;
it's demeaning.

And I refuse to be
trotted out and shown off

like a prize hog
at the Texas State Fair.

Which, by the way, is something
you don't want to attend

wearing a Star Trek
ensign's uniform.

All right,

let me put it this way.

You're gonna put on a suit,
you're gonna come to this party,

and you're gonna
explain your research

to a bunch of old people,

or I swear to God,
I'll blind you with a hot spoon,

like they did  to that little boy
in <i>Slumdog Millionaire.</i>

Oh, you don't want that.

So, Saturday night!

It's gonna be
off the hook.
Ugh!

Get over it.

Oh, boy!

Tator tots and
a party invitation?

What a great day!

âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

âª The Earth began to cool âª

âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

âª We built the Wall âª
âª <i>We built the pyramids</i> âª

âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

âª That all started
with a big bang-- Bang! âª

There you go.

Are you sure
this is right?

Yeah, just tuck that
part in your pants;  you'll be fine.

Okay, let's go smooch some
rich, wrinkled <i>tochis.</i>

Oh, Howard, I can't believe
Bernadette let you go

to a fancy party
wearing a dickey.

Excuse me, my girlfriend
doesn't pick out my clothes.

My mother does.

Oh. We should
get going.

What about Sheldon?

Sheldon is not going.

Really? What do we tell Siebert?

Tell him Dr. Cooper feels
that the best use of his time

is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties

to tear the mask off nature
and stare at the face of God.

Sheldon, it's Saturday night,
you'll be doing laundry.

Don't tell him that,
tell him the mask thing.

Hey, put your tie
back in your pants.

Nice place.

Reminds me of my parents'
house back in New Delhi.

- You're kidding.
- No. We are very wealthy.

But the only difference is,
we have more servants.

- More than this?
- More than we can use.

You see, in India,
we don't make the mistake

of letting up poor people
have dreams.

Ah. There's my band
of brainiacs.

Where's Dr. Cooper?

He's tearing the mask off nature
to look at the face of God.

The board of directors insists
he has a beautiful mind.

I think he's just bananas.

Come on, let me introduce you

to one of the university's
leading donors.

I think we were misled
about the cute girls.

Mrs. Latham, I'd like
you to meet three

of our outstanding
young researchers.

This is Dr. Leonard
Hofstadter,

Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
and Howard Wolowitz.

Well, what happened
to you, Wolowitz,

couldn't stick with it
long enough to get your PhD?

I'm an engineer.

Most engineers
don't bother with a PhD.

But you may be
interested to know

I designed the zero-gravity
waste-disposal system for NASA.

Got it--
you're a space plumber.

I'm gonna go hit the bar.

Tell me about
these two.

- Do him first.
- Dr. Hofstadter

is representing our
experimental physics
program tonight.

I think you'll
really enjoy

hearing about his
fascinating work.

Right.

Fascinate me.

They're cute when they're about
to wet themselves, aren't they?

I'll make it
easy for you.

When you arrive at the lab
in the morning,

what sort of machine
do you turn on?

Coffee maker?

All right, Dr. Kooth--
uh, whatever it is-- you're up.

It's Koothrappali.

I have to tinkle.

And so, instead
of bowing to pressure,

and going to that
pointless soiree,

I stayed right here
and did a load of whites.

Well, normally I respect
your macho rebellious attitude

toward "The Man,"

but, in this case, I think
you've made a foolish mistake.

Unlikely.

But make your case.

Keeping in mind that
your critical attitude

is ruining our
Saturday night together,

and I'm not above
minimizing your window.

Sheldon, like it or not,

until you manage
to upload your intelligence

into a self-sustaining
orbiting satellite,

equipped with high-speed
Internet and a cloaking device,

you will be dependent on other
members of the human race.

That's it.
Prepare to be minimized.

I'm not finished.

All scientists have
to fund-raise, Sheldon.

How do you think
I paid for my lab?

I went to Saudi Arabia
and met with a prince

who had an interest
in neurobiology.

Your lab is funded by some
Middle-Eastern dilettante?

Technically,
Faisal is my fiancÃ©.

But I do have a state-of-the-art
two-photon microscope

and a place to stay in Riyadh
for the winter.

Well, that explains those
puzzling camel race photos

on your Facebook page.

And consider this:

without you to make the case
for the physics department,

the task will fall to people
like Leonard and Rajesh.

Are you trying to scare me?

'Cause you're succeeding.

Well, then prepare
to be terrified.

If your friends
are unconvincing,

this year's donations
might go to,

say, the geology department.

Oh, dear, no! Not the dirt people!

Or worse-- it could go to...

the liberal arts.

No!

Millions of dollars
being showered on poets,

literary theorists
and students of gender studies.

Oh, the humanities!

On the bright side, I don't
think President Siebert

will be making us go
to any more fund-raisers.

It was so much easier
at my bar mitzvah.

The old people just came up
to you, pinched your cheek

and handed you a savings bond.

Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.

Look at the size
of these shrimp!

At what point do we start
calling them lobsters?

Face it, Raj,
we crashed and burned tonight.

Oh, you didn't
do that badly.

Mrs. Latham, the first machine
I turn on in the morning

is the helium-neon laser,
'cause it needs to warm up.

I no longer care, dear.

But don't worry,

I really enjoyed
meeting you this evening.

u're kidding.
That was good for you?

'Cause I was sweating
through my T-shirt.

Excellent! There's
nothing I like better

than making smart people
feel ill at ease.

Why?

Oh, I don't know,
it's one of the fun things

you get to do when
you have lots of money.

Watch.

Hey! Who said you
could eat that shrimp?

See? Fun.

No, no, no, I'm just here

for your money.

I don't want to shake
anyone's germy hands.

Explain it to
them, Siebert.

I must confess

I don't understand you,
President Siebert.

First you say you want me
to appear at your fund-raisers,

but now you say
you never want me to go

anywhere near your fund-raisers.

Forgive me, but that sounds
like a mixed message.

Here we go again.

If there's simply
no talking to me,

why did you call?

I'm sorry, someone's
on the other line.

Why don't you see if you
can organize your thoughts,

and we'll try again later.

Cooper-Hofstadter residence.
Go for Cooper.

Good morning, Mrs. Latham.

Well, yes, of course
I remember you.

A woman well past her prime

seeking to augment
her social status

by doling out her late husband's
ill-gotten gains.

So, how much money
are you going to give me?

I'm not crazy--
my mother had me tested.

Well, if you're not

going to give me money,
then why are you calling?

She wants to talk to you.

Who's crazy now?

Hello, Mrs. Latham.

Yes, I live with him.

I don't...
I-I really don't know why.

Tonight? Sure,
that'd be great.

Okay, I'll see you then.

Bye.

She wants to have dinner
and talk about my research.

An entire dinner
to talk about your research?

Where you going, the drive-thru
at Jack in the Box?

Well, wherever
we're going,

she's sending a car
to pick me up.

Okay,

- I see what's happening.
- What?

My stature intimidates her,

so she's using you to get to me.

Crafty old gal.

Excuse me, but you are not the
only distinguished scientist

in this apartment.

I've been published in
peer-reviewed journals,

I received a Dissertation
of the Year award

for experimental
particle physics.

No, that can't be it.

And since you seem

to have forgotten,
the reason we live together

is we're best friends.

And I got your back, Jack.

That was a great meal.
I'm glad you
enjoyed it.

The only time I eat this well
is when my mom's in town

- and she takes me out to dinner.
- Is that so?

You kind of
remind me of her.

She enjoys making people
uncomfortable, too.

Well, you remind me of
a boy I dated in college.

- No kidding.
- Sweet boy.

Very smart.

If only he'd had money.

Yeah, um...

so, hey,
speaking of money,

how are you feeling about
helping the physics department

get a cryogenic centrifugal
pump and molecular sieve?

Well, I must say, you make a
very persuasive case for it.

Oh, good, good.
And I'm seriously

considering taking it
to the next level.

Terrific. Great.

What level is that?

Okay, now you don't
remind me of my mom.

I'm sorry, so, eventually,
zombies are going to attack

the rehab facility
where Sandra Bullock is?

Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.

You know, it's a shame, all that
work she's doing to get sober,

only to be torn apart
and eaten alive.

Hey. How was dinner?

Swell. I need a drink.

Do we have any alcohol?

No. But we have potatoes--
I could make you vodka.

It'll take two weeks.

Leonard, are you okay?

Um, I'm not sure.

What's going on?

Well, Mrs. Latham said
she was seriously considering

donating money so we could get
a cryogenic centrifugal pump...

Yes!
Oh, wow!

...then she stuck
her tongue down my throat.

Why?

Okay, we can't keep
explaining everything.

Read that book
we got you.

She hit on me.

Wait-wait-wait.
Are you telling us

that old lady wanted
to have sex with you

in exchange for giving your
department millions of dollars?

I think so.

You lucky duck.

You're really
a broken toy, aren't you?

I was able to get out of there
before anything else happened,

but she wants to see me again
tomorrow night.

Excellent!
What are you planning to wear?

What?

Penny, you're an expert on trading
sexual favors for material gain--

walk him through this.

Well, n-no, hold on a second,
I'm not going to sleep with her.

But we need a cryogenic
centrifugal pump.

Well, forget it!
It's not gonna happen.

Well, come now, Leonard,
this may be your only chance

to make a real contribution
to science!

I repeat: Not gonna happen.

What was all that
about me trading sexual favors

for material gain?

It was a compliment.

I believe in giving credit
where credit is due.

Okay, fine. I'll tell him.

Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car
is here for you.

I won't be too late;
I'm just gonna make

a final pitch for the funding
and then say good night.

Hold on,
I have something for you.

What's this?

Just a few things you
may need tonight.

Baby oil, condoms
and, uh...

a little something I procured from the
school of pharmacology.

They say it is to Viagra as
Viagra is to a green M&M.

I am not going
to have sex with her.

Maybe this will overcome
your reluctance.

I went on the Internet
and found a photograph

of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham
to get your libido humming.

Check out those saddle shoes.

Are you insane?

I'm not going
to prostitute myself

just so we can get
some new equipment.

Oh, come on! Why not?

Good night,

Sheldon.
Given how much time

you spend engaging
in pointless self-abuse,

you might consider,
just this once,

using your genitalia to
actually accomplish something!

He still won't shag
the old lady, huh?

No. But thank you for asking.

Hey. Hi.

Hello, Leonard.

I hope you're hungry.

I'm very hungry.

For food, right?

Oh, I made you uncomfortable
last night.

I'm so sorry.

No, that's okay.

No, it most
certainly is not.

Leonard, I'm making the
donation to your department

regardless of what
happens between us.

- Really?
- Well, of course.

There's no quid
pro quo here.

You and your colleagues are
doing remarkable research,

and you deserve the money.

Oh.

Then what was
last night about?

I took a shot; sue me.

Oh.

You're a very
handsome man, Leonard.

Thank you.

It was foolish of me to
think someone your age

might ever be interested
in someone like me.

Oh, don't say that.

- You're a very attractive woman.
- Oh, please.

- No, it's true.
- Well, aren't you sweet.

Just for the record...

you'd remember a night with me
for the rest of your life.

I'm sure I would.

But why-why, exactly?

You're a very smart man.

How do you think I landed
such a rich husband?

I hadn't really
given it much thought.

Well, think about it.

Do you mean...?

Yep. I'm that good.

Oh, what the hell.

Good morning, slut.

What?

Oh, please, I recognize
the walk of shame
when I see it.

All you're missing is
a little smeared mascara

and a purse with panties
wadded up in it.

What's
going on?

Oh, nothing's going on.

Excuse me.

- Are you just getting home?
- Yeah.

That's a good sign, right?

Oh, yeah.

I'm so proud of you!

You sold yourself out

like a common streetwalker!

No, I didn't do it
for the money.

She stiffed you?

I believe that's what
your roommate did to her.

What?!

Again, read the
book we gave you.

No, I mean,

I-I got the money first.

Smart. Get paid up front.

Yeah, I think you have a real
knack for gigolo work, Leonard.

Uh...

I'm gonna go lie down.

That's a good idea;
get your rest.

There are a lot more
rich old ladies out there,

and Daddy needs
a new linear accelerator.

And I thought he didn't learn anything
from his relationship with you.

Hey!

Another compliment!

Learn to recognize them.

Ah, there he is!

The man of the hour!

He took one for the team!

I didn't do it
for the money!

Keep telling yourself that--
it makes it easier.

Trust me, I know.

Cool, buddy!
That's awesome!
Yeah!

<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

Guess who I found at LAX.
My baby sister Priya.

It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

Here you go.

Thanks.

You slept with
my sister?!

Yeah.

This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust!

Would it help
if I told you

that I offered
her my heart,

and she kinda
stomped on it?!

How hard did she stomp?

Very hard.

Okay, I'm good.

What's so funny?

Nothing. Just thinking

about the noises people
make during sex.

I do sometimes get a bit
carried away, don't I?

It's cute.

You sound a little
like a drunken monkey.

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

You know it's meant
as a compliment.

That's how I take it.

This is perfect.

I hope this moment
never ends.

Me, too.

Well, gotta go.
Oh!

Already?
Why don't you stay over?

I'd love to, but you know

my mother needs me in
the morning.

Please, I think the woman can
manage to put a wig on by herself.

It's not just the wig.

It's pinning her hair up,
drawing on her eyebrows.

It's a two-person job.

It's just, when you leave right
after we make love,

it makes me feel...

cheap.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

What can I do?

Stay.

Okay.

Like, what, another five,
ten minutes?

Go home.

Your call.

Howard...

have you ever considered us
living together?

Boy, I don't know.

You, me, Ma living
under the same roof?

No, I mean just you and me.

You can move in here,

or we can find a place.

I've got a better solution.
What?

We wait for my mom's heart
to explode

from all the salt she eats.

Then we just stick her in
the ground, flip her mattress

and move into the big bedroom.

Great.

Look at us planning
a future together!

Who's there?!

Are you a
sex criminal?!

Sex criminals
don't have keys, Ma!

Where were you
so late?!

I was out with Bernadette!

I know what
that means!

I watch <i>Dr. Phil!</i>

I hope to God
you used a condom!

I'm not having this conversation
with you, Ma!

God forbid you get one of
those new fancy sex diseases!

Nobody has a disease!

I hope not!

I share a toilet
with you!

Is that what
you want?!

To give your
mother herbies?!

That's it!
I don't have to take this!

Good luck with your eyebrows in
the morning!

Who's there?!

Are you a
sex criminal?!

I'm still leaving!

I just forgot my Claritin!

Hey, what's up?

I need a place to crash.

Uh, sure.

Why?

Big fight with my mother.

Still arguing over
which <i>CSI</i> is the best?

No, we agreed they all have
their merits.

This was about Bernadette.

What's going on?

Howard's gonna sleep here
tonight.

He had a fight with his mother.

Did you offer him
a hot beverage?

No.

Leonard, social protocol states
when a friend is upset,

you offer them a hot beverage,
such as tea.

Tea does sound nice.

You heard the man, Leonard.

And while you're at it,
I'm upset

that we have an unannounced
houseguest, so make me cocoa.

Point of inquiry,

given that Leonard is
your secondary friend

and Koothrappali is
your primary friend,

why didn't you seek refuge
under his roof?

There's no room.

His sister is staying with him.

Wait, wait. What?

Cocoa, Leonard.
Focus.

I'm down in
the dumps here.

Priya's in town?

Yeah, some work thing.

Anyway, my mother seems
to think that Bernadette...

Hold on.
When did Priya get here?

I don't know.
A couple of days ago.

The thing is, Bernadette doesn't
like that I have to take care

of my mother, and my mother
doesn't trust Bernadette...

Yeah, that's a real pickle.

Bye.

Don't worry.

As your tertiary friend,

I am prepared to step in
and comfort you.

That's not really necessary.

No, no. I'll finish
making the tea,

while you narcissistically
ramble on

about whatever's troubling you.

Thanks.

That's what
tertiary friends are for.

Who is it?

It's Leonard.

You can't come in.

I just want to talk to her.

I forbid it.

Open the door,
Rajesh.

You heard me.

I forbidded it.

"Forbidded" it?

"Forbaded" it?

Get out of the way.

What are you doing here?

What are <i>you</i> doing here?

I have business in Los Angeles.

Why didn't you call?

Clearly, she was
sending you a message

to take a hike, Mike.

I'm sorry.
I thought about calling,

but I just wasn't sure if
seeing you was such a good idea.

I know. Last time
I came on too strong.

Can we talk in private?

No!
Sure.

It's completely inappropriate
for a single woman

to entertain a man in private.

If you insist on talking,
you must do it on the couch!

All right, you may talk in
the bedroom,

but I want this door
to remain open!

All right, just this once
you may close the door.

But keep in mind
I'll be right out here

monitoring the situation!

Oh, damn it.

Leonard, when you get this
message, call me.

Priya, this is your brother.

When you get this, tell Leonard
to check his voicemail.

Would you be sleeping over
again this evening?

Because you're welcome to.

That's very nice of you,
but I made other plans.

Well, just keep in mind that
should you ever need

a slightly apathetic tertiary
friend, I stand at the ready.

Hi, Howard.
Hi, Sheldon.

Hello.
Hey.

Why are you
holding hands?

I forbid you to hold hands.

Rajesh, you know Leonard and I
spent the night together.

Yeah, but you were just
sleeping,

because I forboded you
to have sex.

The word is "forbade""

You sure?
That doesn't sound right.

Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I
have decided

to see each other again,

and you don't get
to tell me

who I can and can't have
a relationship with.

Actually, he can.

The Hindu Code of Manu is
very clear in these matters.

If a woman's father is
not around,

the duty of controlling her base
desires falls

to the closest male member of
her family, in this case, Raj.

The code also states

that if she disobeys,
she will be reborn

"in the womb of a jackal
and tormented by diseases."

If true,

that seems
like an awfully large gamble

given that the prize is Leonard.

There it is, Priya.
We're Indian.

We believe this stuff.

I think it also says that
if you eat beef,

you need to live with cows
for three months

and drink their urine.

Some of it makes sense,
some of it's crazy.

My point is, you can't go out
with Leonard.

Who can't go out with Leonard?

My sister.

Penny, this is
Raj's sister, Priya.

It's very nice to meet you.

Oh, yeah, you, too.

Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness,

it may stem from the fact that
Leonard and Penny used to--

if I may quote Howard--
"do the dance with no pants."

Sheldon!

Really?

Hey, Bernadette, can I
talk to you for a second?

Sure.

Penny, you became disenchanted
with Leonard

as a lover.

Would you please tell
my sister why?

Listen, my mom's
going to Palm Springs

to visit her sister.

That's two whole nights
in a row I can sleep over

with you
all the way to morning.

Unless the desert air
dries out her sinuses,

in which case I'll have
to schlep out there

with the big humidifier.

That's it?

That's your big solution
to all of our problems?

If your mom's nose holds up,
we get two nights together?

Isn't that great?

No, it's not great.

You need to make a choice.

Me or your mother.

Uh...

Wrong answer.

No, wait.

You didn't let me finish.

I'm listening.

Uh...

I came as quickly as I could.

Okay.

Why?

To comfort you, of course.

Sheldon told me about Leonard
dating Rajesh's sister.

So I high-tailed it over here

to pick up the pieces
of your broken heart.

Amy, I'm fine.

You don't have to
be strong for me.

Now let's talk about Priya,
that man-stealing bitch.

What?

In situations like this,

best girlfriends are often
catty about the other woman.

Really, I am not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

Oh. Then perhaps you don't
understand what's going on.

Your former boyfriend
has replaced you

with what appears to be
a very suitable mate.

Arguably much
more suitable than you.

Oh. Well, good for him.

Hey, what do you mean,
"more suitable"?

Well, granted, Penny, your
secondary sexual characteristics

are reasonably bodacious.

But Priya is highly educated,

she's an accomplished
professional,

and she comes from the culture
that literally wrote the book

on neat ways to have sex.

Whereas you, on the other hand,
are a community college dropout

who comes from the culture that
wrote the book on tipping cows.

Yeah. Okay, I got it.

I got it.

So... what is
all that stuff?

This is a portable
electroencephalogram.

I'm doing research
on emotions and brain activity.

So when you start crying,

I can see which region
of the brain is activated.

Then I'm going to stimulate
the analogous area

in the brain of a rhesus monkey
and see if he cries.

Cool, huh?

I choose you.

Really?

Yep. I moved out
of my mother's house.

Cord is cut.

I'm all yours.

What did she say
when you told her?

I don't know. She hasn't
responded to my email yet.

This is so great.

I love you, Howard.

I love you, too.

So what's for dinner?

Well, I don't really have much
of anything in the house.

That's fine.

Why don't we go fool
around in our bedroom?

And then you
can go shopping.

I thought maybe after we eat,
we could see an early movie.

I'd love that.

I love the way you say,

"I'd love that."

She says it the same way I do.

"I'd love that."

Everybody in India
says it that way.

It's not a big deal.

Rajesh, don't be a child.

I'm not being a child.

Leonard, I swear to God,

if your sister
ever comes to town,

I shall have my way with her.

My sister's 38 and married.

All the more shame
that will fall

upon the house of Hofstadter.

Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

That's remarkable.

If pepperoni
were an explosive substance,

you could replace
German shepherds

at our nation's airports.

Hi. Penny, right?

Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

I didn't know you had company.
I don't want to impose.

No, no. It's not
an imposition.

At this point, in our ecosystem,
you are akin to the plover,

a small scavenging bird
that eats extra food

from between
the teeth of crocodiles.

Please, fly into our open maw,
and have at it.

If I had more than a box of
baking soda in my refrigerator,

I wouldn't have to take that.

Hi, bestie.

Hi.

So, um, Priya,

you're a lawyer, right?

I know. Pretty boring, huh?

Oh, come on.
It's not boring at all.

She's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market

which would allow
overseas car firms

to hedge their investments

against potential advancements
in battery technology.

Hmm?

Thank you, Leonard.

That doesn't make it
sound boring at all.

So, how you holding up?

I'm fine.

Oh, who are you kidding?
She's breathtaking.

So, Penny,

Leonard tells me
you're an actress.

That must be
pretty exciting.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's real great.

Today I drove to Van Nuys
for an audition

I thought was going to be
for a cat food commercial.

Turned out to be porn.

Did you get the part?

I didn't do the audition.

Given the state of your career,

can you really afford
to be picky?

I took acting classes
when I was at Cambridge.

I loved it.

We did <i>Taming</i>
<i>of the Shrew.</i>

Oh, wow. I love
Taming of the Shrew.

I did a paper
on it in high school.

"Who knows not where
a wasp does wear his sting?

In his tail."

"In his tongue""
"Whose tongue?"

"Yours, if you
talk of tails,

and so farewell."

"What, with my tongue
in your tail?"

I'm regretting
my earlier cattiness.

She is an
absolute delight.

Wow.

Wow, indeed.

I can't believe we're
finally living together.

Yeah.

You know what would make
this moment perfect?

What?

A little snack.
You got any string cheese?

No.

I-I might have some cheddar.

Not as good.

You can't make strings with it.

Remind me to put it
on your shopping list.

Okay.

You have
hypo-allergenic detergent?

No.

Better put it on the list.

If you wash my underwear
with regular soap,

I get little red bumps
on my <i>tuchus.</i>

Wait a second.

I'm doing your laundry?

Well, honey,
it's not gonna do itself.

Oh, before I forget,

tomorrow morning, you're
driving me to the dentist.

I have to take you?

You don't have to take me.
You get to take me.

Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

your mother usually takes you
to the dentist?

It's not weird.

There's lots of kids there
with their moms.

I can't believe this.

What? It's fun.

If I have no cavities,

afterwards,
we go out for a treat.

All right, Howard, let's get
something straight right now.

I'm not going
to be your mother.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Where did that come from?

Who's that?!

Is it a
sex criminal?!

Nobody wants to do
that to you, Ma!

Where were you?!

Didn't you read my email?!

You know I can't turn on
that <i>ferkakta</i> computer!

I left you some brisket
on the kitchen counter!

Thank you!

Remember
to floss after.

We have the dentist
in the morning!

Oh, hey.
What's up?

I just wanted to
check in on you.

Why?

It seems like the
appropriate thing to do

when one's best friend
finds herself replaced

by a smart, beautiful woman

with the smoldering sexuality
of a crouched Bengal tiger.

I already told you,
I'm okay with it.

I mean, if anything,
I'm quite pleased

that Leonard
has found someone

that makes him so happy.

It's okay, it's okay.

Thank you.

Now, let's get these
electrodes attached

and see what's going on in that
pretty little noggin of yours.

Okay.

I smell Chinese food.

It's actually Thai.

You're slipping.

Are Leonard and Priya here?

They went to Catalina
for the weekend.

Oh. Where's Raj?

At home, forbidding it.

How about Howard?

I'm given to understand

his mother grounded him
for running away.

Oh, okay.

Well, I guess it's just
the two of us, huh?

Actually, it's
the three of us.

AMY
What up, bestie?

Good news.

Thanks to you, I was able
to make a rhesus monkey cry

like a disgraced televangelist.

Great.

So, you feeling better?

Not really.

Sheldon, you have
a guest who's upset.

Right. I'll make tea.

- Sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
- I'm sorry. It's not optional.

<i>Buona sera,</i> <i>Luigi's Pizza.</i>

<i>Buona sera.</i>

It means good evening
in Italian.

May I say, having to explain
that to you calls into question

the authenticity
of your <i>ristorante?</i>

Okay, I'm out of here.

<i>Un momento.</i>

Oh, for heaven's sake.

Now you're being
deliberately stupid.

Where are you going?

I'm having dinner
with Priya at Raj's.

I think Howard's going to be
there. You want to join us?

But tonight's Thursday.

On Thursdays, everybody
comes over here

and has pizza.

Or a reasonable facsimile

prepared by someone claiming
to be Luigi,

but who sounds suspiciously
like Jackie Chan.

Can't we make a one-time
exception for tonight?

We could.

We could also
stop using the letter "M,"

but I think that idea is
<i>isguided</i> and <i>oronic.</i>

Just come with me to Raj's.

Well, I don't want
to go to a party.

It's not a party.
It's the same group of people

who hang out here
hanging out over there.

I'm sorry, but five people
eating and chatting is a party.

How come it's not a party
when we do it here?

Because we don't
throw parties.

I don't know
what to tell you, Sheldon.

I'm going to see Priya.
Everyone's over there.

You coming or not?

Well, no, sir,
and do you know why?

In a word: tradition.

Every Thursday night
for the last eight years,

you and I and our friends
have gathered here

in this very spot to break bread
covered with cheese and sauce,

discuss the issues
of the day,

and yes, share a laugh or two.

But I guess our rich heritage
means nothing to you.

I guess you're right.

- See you later.
- Wait!

Leonard! Wait!

What am I going
to do for dinner?

Come with me to Raj's
and eat there.

I can't do that.

What if he serves haggis
and blood pudding?

I really doubt
that's what he'll serve.

But what if he does?

I'll be obliged to dine

on liver and lungs stuffed
in a sheep's stomach.

And frankly, blood pudding is
essentially the same thing.

I don't know why
he's serving both.

What do you want to do?

You want to come with me, or
do you want to sit here alone?

No, I'll go
to your haggis party.

But I'm telling you.

This is <i>adness.</i> This is utter
and complete <i>adness.</i>

âª Our whole universe

- Oh, dear!
- What?

Raj's television.

I just realized

we're about to spend an evening
watching a plasma screen

with a cluster of dead pixels
in the upper left-hand corner.

So don't watch TV.

Read a book.

And be a social pariah?

Oh, you know
that's not my style.

Ugh!

The audible sigh is a show
of exasperation, right?

Right.

Is it about me
or the dead pixels?

Hey, you're
just in time.

We made Tex-Mex.

Oh, sounds great.

Oh, Indians
making Tex-Mex.

Might as well have had
the Chinese pizza.

Hey, you.

Hi.

That's got to be fun
for you, huh?

Watching Hofstadter
suck the saliva

out of your sister's mouth?

Excuse me. Before this evening
goes any further,

we need to decide
where everyone is going to sit.

There is no assigned seats,
Sheldon.

Just sit anywhere.
Make yourself comfortable.

Oh, what fun.

We're like hippies at a love-in.

Just sit here.

Right on, man. Right on.

Oh, look.

it's <i>Harry Potter</i> <i>and 98%</i>
<i>of</i> <i>The Sorcerer's Stone.</i>

Okay, we've
got fajitas

with all the fixins,
so you make your own.

Wonderful.

Dinner, some
assembly required.

Do you want a margarita,
Sheldon?

A margarita?!

Where are we?!
What is happening?!

Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

What can I get you?

Water. Neat.

With a little umbrella.

Where are all your friends?

Sadly, Penny, this evening,
I am the Dark Knight,

roaming these
mean streets alone.

A windbreaker for my cape,

and a stern expression
for my cowl.

Okay.

Excuse me?

Isn't this the point
where the world-weary barkeep

absentmindedly
wipes down the bar

and coaxes the woes
out of the troubled patron?

Well, I was getting your
stupid umbrella, but all right.

(clears throat)

What's troubling you, buddy?

I don't think your heart's
in it, but since you asked...

Apparently, because
Leonard is dating Raj's sister,

we're all forced
to hang out at his apartment.

Oh, the horror.

Indeed.

Yeah, at one point,
Raj put on reggae music,

and his sister
took off her shoes.

It was like the last days
of Caligula.

(cell phone chiming)

Oh, I have to get this.

Umbrella?

Ugh!

Wonder
what she's exasperated about.

Hello?

Sheldon, are you all right?

When last we spoke,
you were going to

take a taxi home from Raj's,
but according to Facebook,

you just checked in
at the Cheesecake Factory.

Yes, I was in a taxi,

but the driver
didn't look at all

like the photograph
on his license,

so I leapt out and ran for it.

Wise.

There you go.

Just like recovering alcoholics
drink in the Caribbean.

AMY:
Hi, bestie.

Oh. Hi, Amy.

How you been?

Fine.

From this angle,
I can see up your nose.

Yeah, it's a great time
to be alive, isn't it?

Don't worry.
My problems can wait

while you two hens
finish your clucking.

Look, Sheldon, Leonard
is dating Priya.

She is staying with Raj.

That means you're all probably
gonna be hanging out there more.

Penny, I'm sorry
you got dragged into this.

I know you're devastated

that your ex-boyfriend
has found an exciting new lover

with flawless,
caramel-colored skin.

Okay, I'm not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

Your flaring nostrils
indicate otherwise.

Cluck-cluck-cluck.

Sheldon, look at me.

I think it's time

to face the fact

that Leonard is the nucleus
of your social group.

Where he goes, the group goes.

Leonard the nucleus?

That makes no sense.

I'm the whimsical elf

that everyone looks to
for a good time.

I'm not saying
that you're not fun.

You're the most fun person
I know.

A lot of people think
I'm fun to be around.

Don't be needy, bestie.

That's probably part
of what chased Leonard away.

What I am saying, Sheldon,

is that your group
is Leonard-centric.

If it were a town,
it would be Leonardville.

If it were an Islamic nation,
Leonardstan.

If it were the birthplace
of motion pictures,

we'd all be singing
"Hooray for Leonardwood."

Ooh, I got one.

If you guys were a band,

you'd be called Leonard
and the Leonards.

So needy.

What you doing?

I'm setting out snacks.

You do realize everyone's eating
at Raj's again tonight.

I didn't say the snacks were
for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

You're having people over?

Yes. Must be killing you
wondering who.

Fine, I'll tell you.

Stuart from the
comic bookstore,

Barry Kripke from
the university,

Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack

and TV's LeVar Burton.

Really?

LeVar Burton's coming here?

Possibly. I Tweeted him.

Okay, well, tell him
I loved him on <i>Star Trek.</i>

Please, Leonard, stop trying
to horn in on my new friends.

Of course. Good night.

Leonard.
Yeah?

We had a good run, you and I.

Okay.

But change is a part of life.

It certainly is.

Okay.

I have guests coming.

I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.

I am leaving.

Don't make this harder
than it is, Leonard.

Good-bye, Sheldon.

And good-bye to you, sir.

He'll be back.

LEONARD:
Of course I'll be back.

I live here!

Well, it would appear

LeVar Burton
won't be joining us.

Let's get started.

I thought we'd begin
by going around the room,

introducing ourselves

and saying a little bit
about why we're here.

Okay. (clears throat)
I'm Sheldon.

Uh, for regular readers

of <i>The New England Journal</i>
<i>of High Energy Physics,</i>

I need no introduction.

If you're not familiar

with that publication,

there's a free copy
in your goody bag.

Stuart?

Um... (clears throat) Hi.

I'm Stuart.

I run a comic bookstore,

which for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.

And I guess

what I'm hoping for most out
of tonight is a hot shower.

It's very
nice, Stuart.

Zack?

I'm Zack, and I'm, uh...

Uh...

Could you come back to me?

Of course.

Barry?

I'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here

because you told me
there was going to be a whaffle.

When is the whaffle?

Patience, patience, Barry.

The whaffle... (clears throat)

The <i>raffle</i> is the grand finale

to an evening-long festival
of fun and folly.

- One more question...
- Yes, you must be present to win.

(grunts)

Okay, I'm ready.

I'm Zach, and I'm, uh...

Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

Oh, hey.

Hi.
Yo, P-dog.

What's up?

We're here to kidnap you

for a girls' night out.

Parenthetical: the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.

I kind of figured that.

Good. Now put this pillowcase
over your head.

No.

She used to be much more fun,

until Leonard punched her
in the heart.

We just thought you
might want to go out

and have a good time,
maybe go dancing.

Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm
not really in the mood.

You do understand
that it will distract you

from obsessing
over the rich variety

of sweet loving
that your ex-boyfriend

is currently receiving
from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

Okay, look,

if I agree to go out
with you guys,

will you promise
to stop pestering me

about Leonard and Priya?

Yes.
Sure.

All right. I'll go change.
Come on in.

If you'd have let me
bring the chloroform,

we wouldn't have had to put up
with all this jibber-jabber.

Anyway, after we
get done snowboarding,

I go back to the lodge
and get in the Jacuzzi.

There's no one around, so
naturally, I'm free-balling it.

Next thing I know,

this beautiful chick shows up,

drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.

Question.

Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

Really? That's
your question?

What's the difference?

"Jacuzzi" is a commercial brand.

"Hot tub" is the generic term.

I.E., all Jacuzzis

are hot tubs,

but not all
hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

Is that like
all thumbs are fingers,

but not all fingers are thumbs?

Surprisingly, yes.

Nice.

Now, what exactly are toes?

Can you please get back
to the drunk girl?

I'd like something to think
about in the shower.

Oh, yeah.

Right. Anyway, she takes off
all of her clothes,

climbs into the hot tub,
and the first thing I notice...

The water level rose.

No.

Of course it did.

It's said that Archimedes,

the ancient Greek mathematician,

discovered the principle
of displacement

while taking a bath.

Terrific.
Go ahead, Zack.

Naked drunk girl,
free-balling, continue.

Forgive me,
but I think you'll find

my story is
more interesting.

Does yours
have wet breasts in it?

Better.

It has a gold crown.

You see, the king

wondered how much gold was in it

and charged Archimedes with
coming up with the solution.

Because the crown was
irregularly shaped,

there was no way
to mathematically

determine its volume.

But, while bathing,
Archimedes realized

he could immerse the crown

and measure the amount
the water rose.

So, long story short,
I nailed her.

When he finished,
he shouted "Eureka!"

No, I always shout, "Holy moly!"

Don't know why.
Just do.

All right, that concludes

the "getting to know you"
portion of the evening.

Who's ready to play some
vintage video games?

And tonight's selections include

ColecoVision's "Smurf Rescue
in Gargamel's Castle,"

Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch,"

and for you
text adventure aficionados,

"Zork."

(in high voice):
Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.

That all sucks
the big hairy meatball.

How about I go get

the karaoke machine
out of my car,

get plastered and blow
the roof off this place?

Great, I'll make a beer run.

And I'll take a shower.

We'll meet back here in 15.

Check.

(door closes)

I'm unhappy.

This is delicious.

Where'd you learn
to make chili?

When I was at
university in England,

my flatmate was
from Texas.

I hope she wasn't anything
like my flatmate from Texas.

Sheldon is a bit
quirky, isn't he?

Oh, please.
That crazy bastard's looking

at quirky
in the rearview mirror.

Did you know that,
per our roommate agreement,

I have to wash my feet
before I get in the shower?

And not in the sink.

We each have special buckets.

Raj, did you ever
tell your sister

about the time Sheldon
got punched by Bill Gates?

- Oh, God, you're kidding.
- Nope.

Gates gave a speech
at the university.

Sheldon went up to him
afterwards and said,

"Maybe if you weren't
so distracted

by sick children in Africa,

you could have put a little more
thought into Windows Vista."

(all laughing)

Bam. Right in the nose.

Made me proud to own a PC.

I'd like to propose a toast

to a rare and wonderful
Sheldon-free evening.

Hear, hear.
Cheers.

You realize that's the first
time we've ever done that

without having
to listen to Sheldon tell us

why it's called a toast?

Why is it
called a toast?

Oh, the ancient Romans

put spiced toast
in their punch bowls.

Sheldon tells it better.

He kind of does.

Yeah.

Aw, hell, I miss him.

So, where do you guys
want to go dancing?

We were hoping
you'd know a place.

Yes, perhaps somewhere
packed tightly

with young, beautiful bodies

sweating and writhing
against each other

in a glorious orgy
of the flesh.

Oh, yeah, I know that place.

What do you think?

That should display enough
of your bosom

to attract a new mate,
or a hungry infant.

Okay, let's go
through this one more time.

Just because
Leonard has a new girlfriend

does not mean I need to go out
and hook up with some guy.

But you could
if you wanted to, right?

Well, yeah, I guess.

Pick out the hottest guy
in the room,

take him home,
do unspeakable things to him,

then kick him to the curb
with a smile on his face

and teeth marks on his heinie?

More or less.

What's that like?

I don't know.

It's fun while
you're doing it.

And then after,
it's mostly embarrassment,

self-loathing
and regret.

I would take that deal
all day long.

Yeah, well, it's not
gonna happen tonight.

You know, for the
first time in my life,

I am not
in a relationship,

and I'm totally
okay with it.

You know, if being on
your own is new to you,

I'd be happy to share some
tension-relieving techniques

for ladies I've perfected
over the years.

For example, do you have
an electric toothbrush?

PENNY:
Um, no.

You should get one.

What's that?

It appears
to be something preserved

between two pieces of acrylic.

Oh, it's a snowflake
from the North Pole.

Leonard gave it
to me last year.

Oh, God, that is so romantic.

Yeah, it was.

Leonard's really one of a kind.

Saying that
while holding a snowflake

is a bit heavy-handed,
don't you think?

Let me see that.

Oh, screw it.

I can deal with
a little self-loathing.

Let's go find me
a heinie to bite.

Outstanding.

And if we fail,
we can always stop at CVS

and pick you out
a nice toothbrush.

I call mine "Gerard."

That's kind of creepy.

âª Don't go breaking
my heart âª

âª I couldn't
if I tried âª

âª Oh, honey,
if I get restless âª

âª Baby, you're
not that kind âª

âª Don't go
breaking my heart âª

Anybody do "Walking
on Sunshine" yet?

No.

Dibs.

I'm sorry, Sheldon
bought a loom

and learned
how to weave?

He actually
got pretty good.

He made us
all matching serapes.

I still wear mine
when there's a nip in the air.

Now, was this before

or after he adopted
the 25 cats?

Long before the cats.

I think it was
around the time he tried

to declare our apartment
a sovereign nation.

I still have some
of the currency.

(knocking at door)

SHELDON:
All my friends.

All my friends.

I think it's like Beetlejuice.

We said his name too many times.

Come on in.
Thank you.

Hey. I thought you were
with your new buddies.

I had to leave.

They were having fun wrong.

Come here, Sheldon.
Sit here with me.

Thank you.

Would you like some
homemade chili?

Are there beans in it?

Yes.

Then it's not chili.

Real chili has no beans in it,

but you're
from a foreign land,

so your ignorance
is forgiven.

Sheldon, do you want some
or not?

Yes, please.

Your girlfriend's a
little short-tempered.

I'd like
to propose a toast

to friends,
no matter how quirky.

ALL:
Cheers.

Priya, do you know
why this is called a toast?

Actually, I do.

I believe the Romans
used to put spiced toast

in their punch bowls.

She's also a bit
of a know-it-all.

Mmm. This is good.

Whatever it is.

âª I'm walking on sunshine âª

âª <i>Whoa</i> âª
âª <i>Whoa</i> âª

âª I'm walking on sunshine âª

âª <i>Whoa</i> âª
âª <i>Whoa</i> âª

Hello? I...

âª I'm walking on sunshine âª

âª <i>Whoa</i> âª
âª <i>Whoa</i> âª

Oh, I don't think so.

I am so done with Twitter.

Morning.

Morning.

(exhales)

- Sleep okay?
- Um uh.  Great!

Hey, can I ask you something?

Sure.

Last night, me wanting to try
that stuff out of the Kama Sutra.

Was that fun for you
or kinda racially insensitive?

Yes. Just because you're in bed
with an India woman

you think that gives you permission

to use crazy positions
from an ancient Indian love manual.

Hey, if you can find a book
called "Weird Sex with White Boys"

I'd be okay with that.

(laughing)

No, no, you know you have such
beautiful eyes.

Have you ever thought about
getting contacts?

I tried in the seventh grade.
I could never get used to them.

Oh. That's too bad.

Yeah. If I had contacts,
I would have been the coolest

Debate Club president ever to be
stuffed into his own cello case.

If you had them on now, you could
see what we're going to do next.

That-That's okay.
I can infer from context.

Hey, Raj, you wanna see a new
magic trick I been working on?

Eh, Howard.

If I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice.

Is working on magic tricks, really
how you want to spend your time?

Uh, granted,
you're just an engineer, but...

That doesn't mean you might
not someday build a geegaw

or a thingamabob that

that may get you a "thank you" in someone
else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

Is the trick making him disappear?

Sure, let's see it.

Here.
Shuffle these.

Okay.

Now spread them out on the table.
Face down.

Pick one.
Look at it.

Okay.

Now remember your card.
Put it back in the deck.

Is it any wonder
he doesn't have a doctorate?

Now remind me,
what's your birthday?

October sixth.

Okay, October is the tenth month.

So 10-- one plus zero
is one plus six is seven.

Turn over the seventh card.

How about that!

But, is that your card?

Yes. It is.
Very cool!

Oh it's not cool.

It's a childish trick, designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

How'd you do it?

A magician never reveals his secrets.

But surely a future
Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

Fine.

Give me a second.

You ever notice when he thinks
real hard it smells like bacon?

- Oh hey!
- Sorry! Oop!

Check it out.
I just got contacts.

âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

âª The Earth began to cool âª

âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

âª We built the Wall âª
âª <i>We built the pyramids</i> âª

âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

âª That all started
with a big bang âª

One, two,

three, four, five.

No way.

That's your card, right?

Seven of clubs!

That is amazing!

It's not amazing.

All magic tricks are merely
a combination

of manipulation
and misdirection

with the occasional dwarf in
a box wiggling his feet.

Oh, really?
So how did I do it?

I don't care how you did it.

I have more important things
to think about.

Clearly, the cards
are marked.

I thought you had more important
things to think about.

I do.
You just happened

to have caught me
on a break.

Oh, let me see
those cards.

Big deal. Not knowing

is part of the fun.

"Not knowing is part
of the fun."

Was that the motto
of your community college?

Hey, guys,
what do you think?

Priya took me
clothes shopping.

Hey, you look great.

Good for you, Priya.

I could never get that stupid
hoodie off him

when we were...

Well, you look great.

Thank you.

Lets go hang
everything up.

Yeah, good.

New contacts.

I should have done this
years ago.

So you finally getting used to
them doing it on a daily basis?

I'm not going out with him.

He can sleep
with whoever he wants.

Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

Oopsy.

This deck is rigged in
some fashion.

Fine. Get another deck

and I'll do
the trick with that.

So you're saying this is
a regulation deck?

I'm saying believe in magic,
you muggle.

You know, well, I'm happy
Leonard's found someone.

Not that anybody asked.

How many <i>Star Trek</i> uniforms
do you have?

Just two:

everyday and dress.

Uh-huh.

Listen, we need
to talk about something.

Oh, my God, you're breaking up
with me!

Why would you take me out
shopping

and then break up with me?
That is so cruel!

Leonard, I'm not breaking up
with you.

Oh, okay.

So, what's up?

It's a little weird,

your ex-girlfriend hanging out
here all the time.

I know.

I usually never see
my ex-girlfriends,

unless their hard drives crash.

I'm just saying, how would you
feel if I was hanging out

with my ex-boyfriend?

Um, not great, I guess.

But Penny and I are
just friends.

I don't care.

This is a woman you have
slept with.

If you want her around,

then I have to wonder if maybe
you're not ready to move on.

No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

I gave up the gift of
sight for you.

If that's not moving on,
what is?

You need to cut the cord
with Penny.

Oh... okay.

You don't sound very confident.

No, no, I'm confident.

Its not like I'm unfamiliar with
the "get lost" conversation.

Although, this will be the first
time I'll be the one saying it.

Thank you.

I appreciate it.

Sure.

Oh, God, you
smell so good.

Of course, that
could just be

my other senses
getting stronger.

Hypothetically, if I had access

to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?

Leonard, it is a source
of great pain

to me and my family

that my brother has that outfit
in his wardrobe.

Can we not discuss it?

I'm sorry. Never mind.

And was your card the jack
of diamonds?

Oh, unbelievable!

Know how he did it yet?

Um...

Aw, he has the same look
my little nephew gets

when he can't figure out
how I got his nose.

You know, I have some remedial
magic tricks

that might be more your speed.

Like, ooh, look!

The pencil's rubber!

Hey, I think I know how you did
the card trick.

Oh, please, if I don't know,
you don't know.

That's axiomatic.

Come here.

You're right.

Not too bad for someone

who doesn't know
what "axiomatic" means.

Oh, hi.

Hey, you.

What happened with
the contacts?

One of them's upstairs.

The other one sort of slipped
back into my skull.

Hey, is that one of the new
shirts Priya got you?

Yeah.

You don't wanna
wash that.

No?
No, that's silk.

Seriously, what would you do
without me?

Yeah. (chuckles)

You know, I gotta
tell you, I think

you got a real winner
with Priya.
Yeah, me, too.

She seems really sweet.

Believe me, you do not want
to take that for granted.

There are a lot of bitches
out there.

Yeah, bitches are the worst.

All right, I'll
see you later.

Uh, Penny, there's something
I have to tell you.

What?

Okay, uh, how do I put this?

Um... are you familiar with
Darwin's observation

of the finches
in the Galapagos Islands?

Did they make a movie about it?

No.

Then no.

All right, well, anyway, Darwin
observed that when two groups

of finches competed
over the same food source,

eventually one of them would
evolve a different beak shape

so they could feed on
something else.

Okay.

So what do you think we can
learn from that behavior

that we can apply
to our own lives?

Uh, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush?

Sure, that has birds in it.

It's fun talking to you,
Leonard; I always learn stuff.

I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna count that.

PRIYA: Do you really have
to wear that in bed?

Yeah. The doctor didn't want me
to rub my eye during the night.

It was either this or one
of those giant neck cones.

So did you get
to talk to Penny?

Oh, yes.
Indeed, I did.

And?

She completely understood
everything I said. Case closed.

Was she upset?

Maybe, but that's
not my problem.

She's not my girlfriend,
you are.

I hope you weren't
cruel to her.

Is the autumn cruel
for letting the flowers die,

or is that just nature's way?

(knocking)

SHELDON: Leonard?
(knocking) Leonard?

Leonard?

What?!

I think I figured out
Wolowitz's magic trick,

and I need you
to pick a card.

I am not opening
that door, Sheldon!

As you wish.

Pick a card, put it back,
and prepare to be amazed.

Did you pick one?

Yep.

Is this your card?

Nope.

Drat.

Is this your card?

No.

I'll be right back.

Pick a card, Sheldon.

Now look at it,
and put it back in the deck.

Now do you remember your card?

Of course I do, I have
an eidetic memory.

My apologies.

Now shuffle the cards.

Shuffling.

Wait here.

Processing image,
cross-referencing...

Whatcha doin'?

I'm reverse engineering
Wolowitz's magic trick.

What's up
with the infrared cameras?

I'm measuring residual heat
levels on the playing cards

to determine
which one's been touched.

By the way,

if you hope to have children,

I suggest you switch
from briefs to boxers.

Your testicles look a tad warm.

Holy crap,
are you connected

to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory?

Yes. I'm using their
Cray supercomputer

to analyze
shuffling patterns.

Sheldon, that computer
is used

for national defense.

Hacking into it is
a federal crime.

Relax, we're not under
attack right now.

Okay, I'm leaving before the
black helicopters get here.

And is this my card?

Rats!

I wonder if Howard used
a radioactive tracer.

Where am I going to find
uranium-235 this time of night?

Come on, CraigsList.

Is it racist that I took you
to an Indian restaurant?

It's okay, I like Indian food.

Or as you probably call it
back home, "food." (chuckles)

Why didn't you wear
your contacts?

Don't you like them?

No, no, I do.

It's just I knew I was having
curry tonight

and I only want one part
of my body to burn at a time.

You know... (clears throat)

...my company offered me a
position here in Los Angeles.

Does that mean you'd relocate
here permanently?

Maybe. What do you think?

I love it.

That's great!
(knocking)

Hi!

Hi! Just hang on.

(chuckles) Small world.

You did talk to her, didn't you?

Of course, I did.
I talked and talked and talked.

Hey! Look at Leonard
in his fancy-ass
grownup clothes.

Way to go, Priya.
For once, he doesn't look

like a mannequin in
the boys' department.

(chuckles)
Hey, did he

tell you I saved
the silk shirt?

No, he did not.

He was gonna throw it
in the washing machine

with his
Spiderman underwear.

That's our Lenny, huh?
(laughs)

Yes, that's our Lenny.

So how's
the food here?

Oh, wow, that is
really, really good.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys are on a date.

We can hang out
anytime. Have fun.

Bye.
Good night.

Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

Whoo! It really
sneaks up on ya, huh?

All right, I gotta go.

It is pretty spicy.

Oh, I've been meaning
to tell you,

I figured out
your magic trick.

Really?

Oh, yes.

In fact, I improved upon it.

I'd love to see that.

How about you, Raj?

Beefaroni <i>and</i> a show?

How do you turn that down?

All right. (clears throat)

Pick a card.

Okay.

Bippity-boppity-boo.

(beeps)

What's with the wand
and the beep?

The wand is called showmanship,

and the beep is none
of your business.

(text alert tone sounds)

Oh! Excuse me.

I'm getting a text message

completely unrelated
to this magic trick.

Oh, look, my
dry cleaning's ready.

And your card was
the five of spades. Ta-da.

These cards have barcodes
on them.

The wand is a reader.

It's transmitting to your phone.

I said, "ta-da."

Show's over.

That's pathetic.

Let me show you how
a real magician does it.

Raj, take a card.

Don't let me see it.

Okay.

Three of clubs.

Son of a gun,

you're blowing my mind!

Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

That does it.
I'm getting uranium.

You ever gonna tell him?

Maybe.
When it stops being fun.

So never.

Oh, hey, I was
just on my way to work.

Oh, okay,
its not important.

It can wait.

No, it's all right.
Walk me down.

So, what's up?

Uh, I kind of have
a problem

I was hoping
you could help me with.

Sure, anything.

Move out.

What?

Not far.

Hey, if you ever wanna
start a family,

La CaÃ±ada has
some great schools.

Okay, I'm not
moving anywhere.

What the hell
is this all about?

Why does it have
to be about anything?

Can't a fella ask
his buddy to relocate,

no questions asked?

Oh, for God's sake,
Leonard,

this is about Priya,
isn't it?

She doesn't want me
hanging out with you.

Yes. There, I said it.

Okay, look.

I happen to like
your girlfriend.

And she likes you.

No, she doesn't.

Not really, no.

It doesn't matter.
Look, I promise from now on

I will keep
my distance from you.

Well, now, hold on.
What kind of distance

are we talking about?
Because we are neighbors.

I mean, I can hear the toilet
flush in your apartment.

You can hear my toilet flush?

I don't listen for it,
but it's nice to know

everything's okay
with your plumbing.

The building's plumbing.

Leonard, I get it.

You're in
a new relationship now.

And I'm happy for you.

So why don't we
just shake hands
and part friends?

Well, now hold on.

How about this?

How about we still hang out,
but on the down-low?

Are you really that kind of guy?

No.

I actually felt kinda silly just
saying "on the down-low."

Good-bye, Leonard.

Penny, wait.

Ah!

Damn contacts.

Incoming.

- Hi!
- Hey!

Hello.

Why so glum, chum?

Apparently,
you can't hack into

a government
supercomputer

and then try
to buy uranium

without the Department of
Homeland Security tattling

to your mother.

Oh, that's too bad.

Figure out the magic trick yet?

(mocking):
Figure out the magic trick yet?

Want me to tell you
how to do it?

No.

Ill show you one more time.

Raj?

Hang on.

This time do it with me,

so I can make sure
there's no monkey business.

All right.

Two of hearts.
I hate you.

Yeah, he's gonna win
the Nobel Prize.

Here. Breathe
into this bag.

What's going on?

They stole everything, Leonard!

Everything.

Are you the roommate?

Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

Oh, my God,
what did they get?

What didn't they get?

They got my enchanted weapons,

my vicious gladiator armor,

my wand of untainted power,

and all my gold!

You called the police

because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

What choice did I have?

The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

(wheezing)

Into the bag.

They took my battle ostrich!

- Oh, no, not Glenn!
- Yes!

Glenn!

The only bird I ever loved.

Good luck, fellas.

Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

Wait a minute!

You're not going to do anything?

Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

Dr. Cooper.

Seriously?

Not the kind with
access to drugs.

Fine. Dr. Cooper.

I'm sorry for your loss,

but the Pasadena
Police Department

doesn't have
jurisdiction in...

Pandora.

That's from <i>Avatar!</i>

World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

What?

Wh-- you know, one who was
drummed off the force

because he refused
to play by the rules,

and now he hires himself out

to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

No.

Thank you, officer.

It's all gone. <i>All</i> gone.

I'm really
sorry, Sheldon.

What kind of world
do we live in,

where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

I don't know.

This act of aggression
must be met

with swift and cruel ferocity.

It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

I'm on it.

Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

Okay, thanks.

That particular dog of war

will have to call you back
after his bath.

See if Raj is done with Pilates.

Three thousand hours.

Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

collecting weapons and gold.

It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

He got in and out
of your account in under

15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

Oh!

There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

to quell the rage in my heart.

Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

Can we trust him?

I should say so;
he appears to be a member

of the Nigerian royal family.

Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

No. Glenn's was leather.

He was a simple ostrich.

Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

Hey.

Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

What-- "that game"?

Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

Angry Birds is a game.

World of Warcraft is a

massively multi-player
online role-playing...

all right,
technically it's a game.

Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

Stale pastry
is hollow succor

to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

Just say "thank you."

I thought I just did.

All right. See you later.

Oh! Hello.

Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

that's useful in
a make-believe place.

I don't know what that means.

Yeah, well,
sadly, I do.

Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

rollerblading
at the beach?

Can you believe that?

I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

but I don't have
enough information.

I am the one who
spent two years

trying to get him to even

go to the beach
in the first place.

And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

I had to carry him
to the water.

I took Howard to the beach once.

He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

into quality boyfriend material?

I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

I think you're on.
Oh.

That bitch!

Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

Mother warned me about.

I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

Yes, please.

You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

There was no eye contact.

He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

or down at his shoes.

I'm drunk.

You know, for the
first couple of months,

whenever I would
take off my bra,

he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

No, don't do that.

No reason to be mean to her.

This may be the
alcohol talking...

but I believe there is.

Are you familiar
with the recent study

of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

out of Kyoto University?

No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

Bernadette's urge to

shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

is hard-wired into her DNA.

I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

All right, here we are--
this is the tavern

where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

and bending over to pick it up.

Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

According to the
message boards,

if you want to
move stolen goods

and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

PRIYA: Leonard,
is this going

to take much longer?
I thought we were

going to spend
some time together.

Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

(chuckles):
Seriously?

Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

but it's fun.

Maybe I should just go home.

Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

We got him.
We're almost done.

WOLOWITZ:
So, how do

you guys want
to play this?

Be ruthless.
You tell him

if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

with his Internet
service provider.

<i>Sheldon,</i> what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?

He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

Why don't we play this smart?

Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

Oh, dear Lord.

Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

Okay, I see where
this is going.

Fine, I'll have
sex with him.

That's not where it was going.

(laughs)
Good, because
I would hate that.

Leonard, you're busy--
let's talk tomorrow.

Oh, wait.

- Hang on. Are you upset?
- No, no, I think

it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

Oh.

Good, good.

I'll tell you
what happens.

(door closes)

And people think <i>I</i>
don't get sarcasm.

(door opens)

Well, well, well.

Look who it is.

Okay, be nice.

Hello.

Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

Because I do that now.

Count your blessings

you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

What?

Don't listen to her--

she's had a lot
of ice cream.

Do you want to join us?

Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

Four women walk
down the stairs--

how many reach the lobby?

Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

I'm not going to
be your go-between.

Come on, help me out.

Am I in trouble?

(sighs) There's no
reason to worry.

That's a relief.

I'm sure
many women

in happy relationships
spend their nights

Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

Good news, gentlemen--
I found our hacker.

- What?
- Really?

Yeah. No one can hide from me,

not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

not even topless
Natalie Portman.

I've never said
these words before,

but good job, Howard!

Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

Ocean View Road,

Carlsbad, California.

The name and the address
drip with evil.

What else do we know about him?

Why, quite a
bit, actually.

I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

Yes, he does live
with his parents.

Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

We can box him in.

Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

Fine.

You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

but there have been
some terrific advancements

in the field of torture.

No one's getting tortured.

Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

But ask yourself this:

in the course
of our lives,

how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

How many kites?

How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

I totally had one of those.

Of course you did.

It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

But the bullies
took it from us.

Well, no more.

Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

our birthright and our pride.

What do you say?

Who's with me?

I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

Sure.

Also, tonight's the Sabbath

and my mother and I
have a tradition of

lighting the candles and
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune,</i> so...

If we could leave

at 8:00, we'd still be able to

regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

Fine.

Leonard?

Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

two nights in a row.

Oh, come on, man.

Bros before...

...my sister.

Aw, screw it.

I'm in.
Me, too.

And me.

One moment.

I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

not the common cold.

I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

so you could watch <i>Wheel of</i>
<i>Fortune</i> with your mother.

I am.

She's just bleaching
her mustache.

Check it out.

Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

That's incredible.

Yeah, she's kind of
a <i>Wheel</i> savant.

(sitar ringtone playing)

Uh-oh, that's Priya.

Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

Hit the...

Hey, sweetie.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

I'm gonna be working late.

Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

Okay, bye-bye.

Very nice.

You lie to my sister.

That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

(cell phone ringing)

Oh, guess who.

Cover for me.

Hello, Priya. What's up?

How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

Don't be suspicious.

Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

to continue,
you're going to have to believe

whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

You owe me.

New puzzle, Ma!

"Same name"!

One N, two D's, three O's!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

That's uncanny.

I know.
It's her superpower.

Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

to confront this guy.

Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

Totally.

Hey, how about
we stay the night

and hit Legoland
in the morning?

Sea World is better.

It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

I almost feel sorry

for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

unaware that

a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

at 71 miles an hour.

Ease up there, lead foot.

You trying to get us killed?

I took the liberty
of burning us

a mix of heroic
questing music.

This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

It's a
re-writable CD.

Just put it in.

Beyonce? Really?

She's curvy and she owns it.

I like that.

(Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries" plays)

Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.
(chuckles)

We are winged fury!

Which is still no excuse

for going over
the posted speed limit.

âª âª

Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

we take the train.

I always prefer the train.

Sheldon, let's go.

(car door closes)

SHELDON:
Coming.

Why did you bring that?

No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

than a Klingon bat'leth.

Okay, let's get
clear on something.

We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

No one's bat'lething anybody.

So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

No.

Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

Come on.

Can I at least
kick down the door?

You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

(doorbell rings)

MAN:
Who is it?

Your doom!

Don't say "your doom."

Who opens the door
for their doom?

Good point.

Basket of puppies.

What?

Uh...

Sheldon?

Are you Todd Zarnecki?

Yeah. Who are you?

I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

I want my things back.

I don't think so.

Let me see that.

Careful.
That's a collectible.

I know.

I've always wanted one.

(door slams)

Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

You know, the joke's on him.

Without the certificate of
authenticity,

that bat'leth is worthless.

Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

Uh-oh.

What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

I'm not getting any gas.

(rattling)

Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

Of course.

19th-century technology.
Very basic.

Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

No. No.
Not a clue.

Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

It'd be swell
if they had a train.

Thank you, Penny.

No problem.

So, Leonard,

I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

to come get you.

Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

So you lied to her.

Also interesting.

Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

This one's funny,
Leonard.

How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

No. We failed
in our noble quest.

How come?

Todd Zarnecki was mean.

All right. Hang on.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

Oh. Beyonce.

("Ride of the Valkyries" plays)

This ain't no Beyonce.

Now what?

Give my friend his stuff back.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Well, then, good news.

Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

in your little special place.

(exclaims)
(groans)

Now give him his stuff back.

Okay.

We did it!

I said, "we."

PRIYA:
Oh, hold the door.

- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

(clears throat)

Going to see Leonard?

Yes.

How have you been?

Fine. You?

Very well, thank you.

All right, well,
great seeing you.

Yeah. You, too.

Amy's right.

I do want
to fling my poop at her.

My new book <i>The Hidden Reality</i>
takes on a grand question:

Is our universe
the only universe?

You see, there's a growing
belief among scientists like me

that ours may only be one
among many universes

populating a gigantic cosmos.

In <i>The Hidden</i> Reality,
I explore this possibility

without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics

on the part of the reader.

Hysterical.

I'm glad you
talked me into this.

We work so hard, sometimes,
it's nice to goof off

and do something silly.
Agreed.

Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

You can think about Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle"

much like the special order menu

that you find in certain Chinese
restaurants, where you have

dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B,

and if you order the first dish
in column A,

you can't order the
corresponding dish in column B.

That's sort of like the
"uncertainly principle."

âª Ba-dum-bump. âª

Say, I heard an
interesting tidbit

about Howard and
Bernadette.

Really, Amy? Gossip?

I'm disappointed in you.

Now, now.

Evolutionary biologist Robin
Dunbar has identified gossip

as an aid to social
bonding in large groups.

Forgive my language,
but "poppycock."

What if he's right?

And by not
participating in gossip,

society breaks
down into

small feral bands of tattooed
motorcycle riders

fighting to the death over the
last few cans of tuna fish?

Fine.

In the parlance
of the urban music scene,

"what's the 4-1-1"?

Bernadette is thinking about
breaking up with Howard.

I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

Excuse me.
Dr. Greene, question?

Yes?

You've dedicated
your life's work

to educating
the general populace

about complex scientific ideas.

Yes, in part.

Have you ever considered

trying to do something useful?

Perhaps, reading to the elderly?

Excuse me?

Yeah, but not your books;
something they might enjoy.

I kid, of course. Big fan.

Nice shot.
Thank you.

My father taught me archery
as a child.

It's odd how the activity

brings back the smell
of Kmart bourbon.

Perfect.
I know.

What an elf
I would have made.

Whoo.

What do you think you're doing?

Shooting at a target?

With what?

An arrow.
Really?

I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

I'm not going to do that,
Sheldon.

Leonard, the people at Nintendo
can only go so far

in helping us recreate
an actual athletic experience.

We have to do our part, too.

That was uncalled for,
but...

I'll play along. Ow.

I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

Really? How could you tell?

She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

Mm. You don't say.
Yes.

I think prolonged exposure
to Penny

has turned her into a bit
of a Gabby Gertie.

So, what's the gossip?

Oh, please, I was just
pointing it out.

I have no desire to engage
in the activity.

Fine, don't tell me.

All right, get this.

Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

Oh...

That's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

Mm, it's hard to say.
I can only speculate

based on the data I collected

watching my parents' marriage
implode.

In that case,
the woman dives into religion,

while the man dives
into a bottle-blonde bartender

who tries to buy my love
with action figures.

Oop! Out of arrows.

Boy, you sure get your money's
worth out of these games.

Priya, can I come in?
Sure.

Oh, God.

What?
It's okay.

You didn't know.
I'll take care of it.

What-what did I do?

Sheldon doesn't allow flossing

that close to the mirror.

You're kidding.

It's a splatter thing.

There's a little piece of tape
on the floor

you're supposed to stand behind.

That's madness.
I know.

Just do it. There's a big
inspection coming up,

and I don't want to lose
my TV privileges.

You really need
to let me take a look

at that roommate agreement,
one of these days.

Mm, I don't know.

I get a lawyer,
he gets a lawyer...

It's just easier
to stand behind the tape.

Oh, by the way,
a fellow at work

said I could use his
Dodger tickets this weekend.

Does that sound like fun?
Yeah!

Dodgers are baseball,
right?

You'll need to explain
the game to me.

Mm, it's complicated.

But as I remember it,
the essentials are

"get chosen last, get hit
by the ball, cry, go home."

Well, regardless,
I've got four tickets.

And I was thinking we can bring
Bernadette and Howard.

She's really interesting,
and I bet I can get used to him.

Well, it might not
be a great idea

to invite those two.
Why not?

Don't tell anybody
I told you,

but I heard she might
be breaking up with him.

Oh... too bad...

Although I do know one person
for whom that's good news.

Really? Who?

My brother.

He's got a big crush
on Bernadette.

What?

You're kidding.

No. I found poems
he wrote about her.

Very disturbing.

"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

Wow, that's hard to believe.
Yes.

And for years,
everyone in my family

was convinced that <i>he</i> was
the clarinet enthusiast.

Hmm. What's that
piece of tape?

Oh, that one doesn't
apply to you. You sit.

Hey.
Hey. How's it going?

Not too bad. Did you hear
about Howard and Bernadette?

'Course I heard about it.
How did you hear about it?

I heard about it
from Sheldon.

He got it from Amy.
Oh, damn it.

I told Amy that in the
strictest confidence.

Boy, some people are
such blabbermouths.

Well, whatever.

I'm sure Bernadette
can do better.

Do you think a sexually ambivalent
Indian astrophysicist

with selective mutism
and alcohol issues is better than

a hundred-pound Jewish guy
who lives with his mom?

You are kidding.
Raj likes Bernadette?

I didn't say Raj.
Who said <i>Raj?</i>

Okay, give.

How do you know?
Did he tell you?

No.
Well, then who?

I can't say...

Priya told you.
What a little gossip.

You know, not an attractive
quality in a woman, Leonard.

Not judging,
just my opinion.

Well, The point is,
if this got out,

it would destroy Howard
and Raj's friendship.

You don't have to worry.

Unlike Amy and Priya,
I know how to keep a secret.

You're the one who told Amy
in the first place.

In confidence!

Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
How are you?

We're very rich
in a very poor country.

So, all in all,
can't complain.

So, Priya,

how are enjoying
staying with your brother?

It's fine. But if
I'm going to stay

in Los Angeles much longer,

I think I should
get my own place.

Why?

Is Rajesh not making you
feel comfortable?

Rajesh, why aren't you making
your sister comfortable?

I am making her comfortable.

Besides, she's not
sleeping here

half the time anyw...

What?

Where are you
sleeping, Priya?

It's a figure of
speech, Daddy.

It means I-I work late.

Please tell me
you're not dating an American.

I knew this would happen.

Rajesh, are you
letting your sister

date that little Howard boy?

Now, hold on. If she
is dating an American,

that's not a bad way to go.

He's Jewish.

Those chaps are
very successful,

and they don't drink a lot.

It-It doesn't matter.
Howard has a girlfriend.

For now.
What does that mean?

I'll tell you later.

Is something going on
with him and Bernadette?

Who's Bernadette?
Doesn't sound Jewish.

You can't tell by that.

Winona Ryder is Jewish.

Okay, we're getting
off the subject.

Rajesh, I want
you to try harder

to make your sister
feel welcome.

Thank you, Daddy.

Don't worry. Everything I have,
I share with her.

Including my friend Leon...

Good night, Mummy.
Good night, Daddy.

Oh, my God,
I think you broke my toe!

You should have kept
your mouth shut.

Fair enough.

Now, what's up with Clarinet...?
Bernadette!

I've been thinking about
Dr. Greene's efforts

to make science palatable
for the masses.

Oh, yeah? What about it?

That's all. I've just
been thinking about it.

Now, I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

Now I'm thinking about

the origin of the phrase
"train of thought."

Now I'm thinking about trains.

Are you listening
to this guy?

Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

I was somewhere else.

Lucky bastard.

Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.

So what's up?

It's a Bernadette thing.

Oh, no. I hope
everything's okay.

Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

You can tell us anything.

Yeah. Good or
devastating.

I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

Marry you?
What?
Yeah.

I just need to figure out the
right time to pop the question.

Oh, I'd wait.
No rush, no rush.

Oh, great. It's my cousin David
about the ring.

Hey, David, what'd you find?

Sure, a half a caret's fine.

Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

It's one of the reasons
I love her.

Man, he's going
to be blindsided.

I know. It'll be awful.

Why are you smiling?

Yeah, Raj, why?

Uh, a smile means something
different in my country.

You know, tears of joy,
smile of sadness.

India's a goofy place.

Oh, I'm back to trains.

Woo-woo.

Did I tell you our lab got
a grant to study addiction?

No.
Fascinating work.

I recently trained a capuchin
monkey to smoke cigarettes.

Have you learned anything?

Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

Although it's not
much of a contest.

The other monkeys just
sit around and masturbate.

If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

By all means.

Howard has announced
his intention

to propose marriage
to Bernadette.

I don't understand.

The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

I know.

The group consensus
is that his proposal

will be met with an humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

Everyone was set a-twitter.

Although oddly,
no one tweeted.

It's not surprising that
the story has captured

the attention of our
little circle of friends.

Are you familiar
with meme theory?

I'm familiar with
everything, but go on.

Meme theory suggests

that items of gossip
are like living things

that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

I'm no stranger to
memetic epidemiology.

At Johnson Elementary School,

the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

I should think so.

That's gold.

Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

How might we examine
this more closely?

Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

We need to fabricate a
tantalizing piece of gossip.

And a second non-tantalizing
piece to use as a control.

Then we'll track its progress
through our social group

and interpret the results through
the competing academic prisms

of memetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.

Look at you, getting me to
engage in the social sciences.

You're a vixen,
Amy Farrah Fowler.

Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

Sheldon and I engaged
in sexual intercourse.

In other news, I'm thinking of starting
an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.

Oh, hey, Raj, what
are you doing here?

I just felt like drinking alone,

because I'm deep and dark.

Uh-huh.

So, uh, Howard's not here?

No. It's just one of those
times when it's just you and me.

Like when the three of us
went to the movies,

and you and I waited outside
the bathroom

while Howard threw up
Red Vines and Cherry Coke.

Do you remember that?

Yeah.

Me, too.

Good times.

16 wants to order appetizers.

Oh, thanks.
This was nice.

What the hell are you doing?

Howard is your best friend,
and that is his girlfriend.

You should be
ashamed of yourself.

I was when I came in,

but it's amazing what
liquor does to guilt.

Besides what you
might not know

is Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

Well, I know that. How do you know that?
My sister told me.

Oh, that gossipy bitch.

No offense.

None taken.

You should hear how
she talks about you.

Okay, listen, just because Howard
and Bernadette are having problems,

does not mean you should
be here sniffing around.

What can I do?

I can't stop
thinking about her.

All right, try
thinking about this--

Sheldon and Amy had sex.

Shut your ass!

Yeah, it's true.
Amy told me.

How did that even happen?

Did they know that's
what they were doing

when they were doing it?

I-I guess they just figured
it out at some point.

Wow.

I can't believe old
Smelly Pooper finally got laid.

Hey.
Hey.

Hope you're hungry.

Interesting.

A friendly sentiment
in this country,

cruel taunt in the Sudan.

It's a lesson in context.

Will Amy be
joining us for dinner?

Yes, I believe so.

Good, good.

Everything...
okay between you two?

Yes.

Why do you ask?

No reason.

I was just talking to Raj,

and he mentioned what a lovely
glow she has these days.

Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun,

tending an herb garden without
wearing a hat or sunblock?

No.

That's not what he meant.

Well, we may never know.

As my mother would say,

the Asians are
an inscrutable folk.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

Yeah, you do.
You dog, you.

Did you get that?

Every word.

Our false gossip meme appears
to have reached node lambda.

This is moving faster
than we thought.

Agreed.

It appears the rate

of gossip transmission

is proportional
to the number of nodes squared.

I must say, Amy,

pretending
to have intercourse with you

is giving me
a great deal of satisfaction.

Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

Pass the soy sauce.

Bernadette just asked about
my sexual encounter with you.

The meme has reached
full penetration.

Pun intended?

No. Happy accident.

This is remarkable.

Took less than 24 hours.

I should let you know

that she asked for details
about our dalliance.

Interesting.

So it went beyond the
mere fact of coitus

to a "blow by blow,"
as it were.

Pun intended?

I'm sorry. What pun?

Not important.

I described your lovemaking
as "aloof, but effective."

I wish you hadn't done that.

That's going to make
me a chick magnet,

and I'm so busy as it is.

Hey, everybody,

I got something I want
to ask Bernadette,

and I can't think
of a better time

than when I'm
with all my friends.

Oh, hold on, Howard.

There's lots of better times.

Leonard, please.
The man is talking.

Let him get it out, and let
the chips fall where they may.

Thank you.

Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

Oh, God.
What's happening?

I know things haven't
been perfect with us,

and we've had our problems,

but I just have to tell you,
from the moment I...

Howard, let me just
stop you right here.

This is it.

Yes.

Yes, what?

Yes, I will marry you.

You will?
You will?

I will.

I will!

Oh, I love you so much.

Oh, I love you, too.

Congratulations!

Oh, it's so exciting.

I wonder what
changed her mind.

Perhaps your talk
of my sexual prowess

renewed her faith in love.

As good an explanation as any.

That's great...

Oh, hey, Amy.

Bernadette just texted me.

Howard proposed?

Yes, not important.
Just stopped by

to let you know I'm
getting orthotics.

Also, I'm carrying
Sheldon's baby.

Mum's the word.

You're pregnant?!

Wow. Is there anything
on there about orthotics?

Leonard, are you in the shower?

I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

I asked if you
were in the shower,

but that's moot now!

What?

Moot! Rendered unimportant
by recent events!

I can't hear you!
I'm in the shower!

I have to skip
the chitchat.

Emergency.

What kind of
emergency?

Mathematical--
32-ounce banana smoothie,

16-ounce bladder.

You might not
want to do that.

I assure you I do.

Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

What?!

Hello, Sheldon.

What are you doing in there?

She can't be in here!

We were in here first;
<i>you</i> can't be in here.

According to
the roommate agreement,

paragraph nine, subsection B,

"The right
to bathroom privacy

is suspended in the event
of force majeure."

And believe me,
I am experiencing

a <i>very</i> majeure force.

Come on, you can't
wait two minutes?

Oh, Leonard,
let the man pee.

Penny? Penny?

Penny?

What?

Move. Move. Move!

Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

you are officially charged

with two violations
of the roommate agreement.

Do you waive

reading of the charges?

Yeah, fine.

Hang on. No.

My client does not waive
reading of the charges.

Oh.

Cool. I've got
a lawyer.

And I've seen her naked.

Proceed.

Very well.

"Count the first:

"On or about
the 28th day of April,

"the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought

"deny access
to the shared bathroom

"in a time of emergency, to wit,
my back teeth were floating.

"Count the second:
the accused exceeded

"the agreed upon occupancy
of the shower,

"to wit, one,
unless we are under attack

by water-soluble aliens."

Can I see
the roommate agreement?

Um, it's fairly technical.

I think I can handle it.

Top of her class,
Cambridge University.

Licensed to practice law
in three countries

and your face.

All right,
based on a cursory reading,

it doesn't look like you have
much of a case, Sheldon.

Do so, do so.

Oh, I'm afraid not.

Section seven here, on
the right to enter the bathroom

in emergency situations,
is not specific

as to what constitutes
an emergency.

Oh, that's ridiculous!

A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

Is it? If Leonard forgot
to trim his nose hair,

could he barge in
while you were showering?

Irrelevant. Leonard
doesn't trim his nose hair.

He thinks because he's short
nobody can see up there.

My point is, Sheldon,
the legal principle is,

ambiguity in a contract benefits
the party that did not draft it,

in this case, Leonard.

So much for count one.
But...

There's no buts, Sheldon;
that's how the law works.

Schooled!

As for the shower capacity
issue,

I cite addendum J.

"When Sheldon showers second,
any and all measures

shall be taken to ensure an
adequate supply of hot water."

I believe this supersedes
the occupancy issue.

Superseded!

This isn't over.

No offense, but
shower sex with you

is now the <i>second</i> best thing
that's happened today.

Mmm, Greek food
on pizza night?

This is the most delightfully
cruel thing we've done to Sheldon

since we left that fake message
from Stephen Hawking

on his voice mail.

Seriously?

I wish to discuss your theories
of black holes.

Meet me at the Randy's Donut
by the airport at 2:00 a.m.

What is that you're eating?

Tonight is pizza night.

I'd like to refer that
to my attorney.

According to what I see here,

Thursday nights
are Franconi's pizza night.

Yes, and when Franconi's
went out of business,

we switched to Graziano's.

That's interesting.

Can you just switch
restaurants like that, Priya?

A good question, Howard.

Turns out you can't.

According to
the document

you drew up, Sheldon,
the selection

of a new takeout restaurant
requires public hearings

and a 60-day comment period.

Were those criteria met?

No.

Opa! Opa!
Opa!

This is Greek food?

Leonard, you hate Greek food.

Not as much as you.

Fine. I'm nothing
if not adaptable.

I got you the
lamb kabob.

Thank you.

If you think about it,

Greek food isn't that far
from Italian food.

They share a spice palette.

And what a civilization
is the Greeks'!

They gave us science, democracy,

and little cubes of charred meat
that taste like sweat.

Penny? Penny?

Penny?

Hey. What's up?

The mean Indian lady tried
to make me eat lamb.

Congratulations.

Pizza night will now
be at your apartment.

Order one.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

I'm meeting Amy and
Bernadette for dinner.

But you're welcome
to tag along.

A girls' night?

Oh, I don't know
if I'm up for an evening

talking about rainbows,
unicorns and menstrual cramps.

Okay, suit yourself.

We'll probably be
trashing Priya a little.

Shotgun.

Okay, I'd like
to propose a toast

to a wonderful
girls' night out.

Fair warning--
we can get ca-razy.

Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons.

Really, Amy?

Tobacco and alcohol?

Need I remind you not a lot of
scientific discoveries were made

by people having a good time?

Why did you bring him?

He's harshing my buzz.

I felt sorry for him.

Priya's giving him a hard time.

Ooh, the Priya bashing's
starting early. Yay!

Okay, what's up
with those pantsuits?

I need some context.

Pantsuits suck.

And that opens her up

to justifiable ridicule
for wearing them.

Good one, Bernadette.

See? Ca-razy.

Whee...!

You smell like baby powder.

It's talc.

But as that's a primary
ingredient of baby powder,

I understand your confusion.

Oh, I'm not
confused at all.

You're like a sexy toddler.

I don't know
how to process that.

I do.

âª Amy and Sheldon
sitting in a tree âª

âª K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G. âª

That's too many S's
for "kissing."

Not if they're doing it
for a long time.

Sheldon... have you
ever kissed a girl?

Other than my mother,
my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.

But in the interest
of full disclosure,

I was once on a bus

and had to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

to an elderly nun who passed out
from heat exhaustion.

Every year I get
a Christmas card from her,

signed with far
too many X's and O's.

That doesn't count.

Aren't you even
a little curious?

Yeah, you're a scientist--
where is the curiosity?

I'm available
for experimentation.

Thank you.

Not necessary.

We know everything
there is to know about kissing.

It requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles.

Oh, blah, blah, blah.

Give me some sugar, bestie.

I'm certainly glad
no one said they were curious

about Aztec human sacrifice.

Hey, I know--
let's take Sheldon dancing.

Ooh, I totally want
to see Sheldon dance.

I bet he looks like
a spider on a hot plate.

No, thank you,
but for the record,

I'm an excellent dancer.

Proficient in the rumba,
waltz and cha-cha.

Really?

I don't see why
that's surprising.

I excel at so many things.

You've had my sourdough bread.

Did you take dance lessons?

Against my will.

In the South,
preadolescent children

are forced through
a process called cotillion,

which indoctrinates them
with all the social graces

and dance skills needed to
function in 18th century Vienna.

Oh, we are so
taking you dancing.

No, you most certainly are not.

Well, what does your cotillion
training say is expected

of a gentleman when three ladies
ask him

to escort them
to a dance soiree?

I saved a nun's life.

Why am I being punished?

Take us someplace we can waltz.

Where you can what?

Waltz. It's a social dance
from Austria

choreographed
to a three-four time signature.

Oh, waltz.

Here we go.

âª I kissed a girl
and I liked it âª

âª I hope my boyfriend
don't mind... âª

What happened to you?

Shake it baby,
shake it!

<i>Muy caliente,</i> Sheldon!

Care to dance?

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

How about you?

Oh, what the hell.

Ooh!

How come if we're
the smart people,

we don't do this
every night?

What's 16 times 14?

My burps taste
like cranberry juice.

And there's your answer.

Would you like to come in
for a nightcap?

If you're referring
to the beverage,

you know I don't drink.

If you're referring
to the hat you don

while wearing a nightshirt and
holding a candle, I have one.

I have Yoo-hoo.

It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo.

The name literally beckons.

Make yourself comfortable.

Thank you.

Is someone smoking?

Oh, that's just Ricky.

You own a smoking monkey?

Don't be silly.
He's one of the animals

in my department's
nicotine addiction study.

What's he doing here?

I'm giving him emphysema.

The least I can do is let him
hang out and watch cable.

Remarkable.

Aren't you worried
about secondhand smoke?

A little.
The real danger is him biting

my face off while I'm sleeping.

Is he deliberately
blowing smoke at me?

Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

Thank you.

May I share
something with you

that's troubling me?

Of course.

What's rattling around that
big bulbous head of yours?

Priya has essentially nullified

my roommate agreement
with Leonard,

making life in the apartment
very uncomfortable for me.

And you want me
to kill her? Done.

No, of course not.

I trained Ricky how to smoke.

I can train him
to shoot a poison dart.

No jury would convict us
'cause people love monkeys.

I understand

the alcohol has stirred up
whatever it is

that makes girls go wild...

but I really need to talk
to smart Amy now.

Excuse me.

Have you considered
that your intelligence

might be the very thing
causing your dilemma?

No.

What do you think Ricky
over here would do

if an interloper
encroached on his territory?

Well, when challenged, monkeys
generally assert their dominance

through chasing, assault
and a stylized penile display.

That's a little outside
my comfort zone.

You're being too literal.

My point is, he would not meekly
surrender to the rules,

and neither should you.

Are you suggesting I play dirty?

Yes, dirty.

Dirty... dirty... dirty.

Which brings me to our
next order of business.

Fascinating.

I hope you don't take
what I'm about to do

as a comment
on what we just did.

Who's to say you shouldn't be
dissecting our brains?

You really are an ass.

Morning, Sheldon.

Oh, good, you're up.

I've written a new
and improved

roommate agreement
that benefits me greatly.

I'd like you to sign it.

Why would I want
to do that?

Excellent question.

Do you remember
what happened to the alien,

played by talented character
actor Frank Gorshin,

in the <i>Star Trek</i> episode "Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

Uh, Captain Kirk activated
the self-destruct sequence

and threatened to blow up
the <i>Enterprise</i>

and kill them both
unless he gave in?

Affirmative.

Computer, this is
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Activate self-destruct sequence.

Code 1-1-A-2-B.

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence
activated.

What are you
gonna do, Sheldon,

blow up the apartment?

That was my first thought,
but all my cool stuff is here.

So what happens
when it counts down?

Unless Leonard signs
the new agreement

in the next 41 seconds,

this computer will send an
e-mail to your parents in India

saying that you're in
a secret relationship

with the
whiter-than-Marshmallow-Fluff

Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, my God.

What's the big deal?

Trust me, it's a big deal.

They're gonna find out
about me eventually, right?

Yeah, of course,
just not today.

20 seconds.

Are you ashamed of me?

Of course not.

Then why can't we
tell your parents?

Please, don't push this.

He does that all the time,
doesn't he? 15.

Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win.
Turn it off.

No, he's bluffing.

I never bluff. Ten.
It's blackmail!

Nine.
We give up.

Eight.
This is ridiculous.

It's a laptop
with a full charge.

Honestly,
what do you see in him?

Give him what he wants
or we're done.

Three.
Really?

Two.
Okay, I'll sign it!

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

You may have gone
to Cambridge,

but I'm an honorary graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

Good morning, Amy.

It most assuredly is not.

Are you experiencing
dehydration, headache,

nausea and shame?

Yes.

I also found a Korean man's
business card

tucked into my cleavage.

What happened last night?

Ah, memory impairment;

the free prize at the bottom
of every vodka bottle.

Sheldon?

All right.

Last night you gave me
some excellent advice

regarding my problem here
at home,

you kissed me and then vomited
on and off for 40 minutes,

following which you passed out
on your bathroom floor.

I then folded a towel under
your head as a pillow,

set your oven clock
to the correct time

because it was
driving me crazy...

...and I left.

Okay.

Don't really know
where we go from here.

I suggest
we treat our relationship

as if it were
a crashed computer

and restore it to the last point
we both agree it worked.

Terrific. Thank you.

They were out of menthols!

Get off my back!

Not easy living with a
temperamental little primate.

Come on, Priya,
just admit I embarrass you!

You're preaching
to the choir, sister.

I must say, Penny,
this is great fun.

Glad you're
enjoying yourself.

Until I met you and Bernadette,
my trips to the bathroom

had been entirely focused
on elimination.

Now they have a delightful
social aspect.

Amy, you must've been
in the bathroom

with other women before.

Of course I have.

But they were strangers
and seemed off-put

when I engaged in friendly
stall-to-stall chit-chat.

Some women don't
like to get chummy

when their panties are down.

You okay in there, bestie?

I'm fine...

The reason I ask is
that many people

experience bladder shyness;

the inability to pass uri...

Yeah, I said I'm fine.
Stop talking to me.

She always this crabby
when she urinates?

We're really not that close.

Screw it.
I'll go later.

And I'll be right
by your side.

Did I tell you
Priya invited

me and Howard to have dinner
with her and Leonard?

Oh, that's nice.

No, it's not.

It's a strategic maneuver.

Leonard's new girlfriend is
testing Bernadette's loyalty

to you and the group.

That bitch is crafty.

- You think?
- Of course.

How does the cheetah attack
a herd of wildebeests?

By going after
its weakest member.

Well, what makes me
the weakest member?

Your trusting nature coupled
with your teeny-tiny body.

You wouldn't last a minute
on the Serengeti.

Okay, Amy,
you're being silly.

I'm not concerned about
who hangs out with who.

And I certainly
don't have a problem

with Leonard's new girlfriend
who wears way too much makeup.

Ooh, these are cute.

Of course if I buy them,

I'll have to rent
my womb out to a gay couple.

It doesn't matter. I'm going to
tell her we can't make it.

Oh, no. You <i>have</i> to go.

I don't understand.

I thought I was
a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

You are-- with hair
that smells like strawberries.

And we're going to use that
to our advantage.

Wait. What are you
talking about?

By accepting the invitation,
Bernadette becomes

a double agent
inside the enemy camp.

She could ferret out
Priya's tactics,

identify her weaknesses

and feed her false
information, such as:

Leonard's no stranger
to back-alley cockfights.

I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.

They kind of whup that
out of you in Catholic school.

Don't worry.
I'll teach you.

I did two years
of Cub Scouts

before they found
out I was a girl.

Okay, I don't
know you people.

I'm just an innocent
woman wondering

if this shoe store will
take my Texaco card.

How do you feel about
concealing a recording device

in the cleavage of
your ample bosom?

I don't want anything

Come on, Strawberries.
Take one for the team.

- Okay, see you later.
- Good news.

I finally have a handle on my
idea for three-person chess.

That is good news. Bye.

Uh, do you know
how I solved

the balanced center
combat-area problem?

Five words:

transitional quadrilateral
to triangular tessellation.

That... that's brilliant.

It's what I do.

But wait, there's more.

I also invented
two new chess pieces.

The serpent...
and the old woman.

Okay, now I have to ask.
What do they do?

When the serpent slithers
to an opposing player's piece,

that piece
is considered poisoned

and will die
after two more moves.

All right.

Unless... it gets to
the old woman in time,

in which case
she sucks out the poison,

turning her into
the Grand Empress:

a piece combining the power

of the knight, queen
and serpent.

Elegant.

That's because it's simple.

Okay, well, I look forward
to playing with you.

And...

And what?

And a third person.

It's three-person chess.

I must say,
ever since you started

having regular intercourse, your
mind has lost its keen edge.

You should reflect on that.

Excuse me, but Einstein had
a pretty busy sex life.

Yes, and he never unified
gravity with the other forces.

If he hadn't been
such a hound dog,

we'd all have time machines.

Got it. Bye.

You know I'm right.

I think he's getting worse.

Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

I'm just breaking in
some new shoes.

- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

Did you know that women
wear high heels

to make the buttocks
and breasts more prominent?

Hadn't really thought about it.

Look.

Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

Please, Leonard, don't leer,
you have a girlfriend.

- Sorry.
- So, are you off to dinner

with Priya, Howard
and Bernadette?

Yeah. How did you know?

I heard it at the mall,

when I was shopping
with my girlfriends,

'cause, you know,
that's kind of my life now.

Have a good night.

Try not to ogle my caboose
as I walk away.

- Hey, you.
- Hi.

Hey, Raj, will you
be joining us for dinner?

The lonely guy
and the two happy couples?

I'd rather get a prostate exam

from a leper who walks away
with nine fingers.

Oh, would you please stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.

Just like I'm the only one
who'll have sex with me.

Really? In front
of your sister?

We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.

Excuse me. I'm going to go
wander the streets alone.

Invisible, unwanted and unloved;

a pathetic shadow
in a city with no heart.

I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.

I don't understand. Is this
a way to break in new shoes?

No. Once these puppies
touch the ground

they're mine,
and I'll have to wear them

walking up and down
Hollywood Boulevard

in order to pay them off.

Pretty, pretty, pretty.

Good news: the wildebeest
is in the curry.

The what?

Bernadette is with
Priya and Leonard.

Message received.

Commence operation
"Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

Hey. Seriously?

Didn't you get enough of this
cliquey crap in high school?

I wish. A clique
requires friends.

- I didn't have any.
- None?

I used to take my lunch
down to the maintenance room

and eat with the janitor.

It was nice until his wife
called me a <i>puta</i>

and made me stop.

Hang on.

It's the wildebeest.

Priya just made a snide comment
about your acting career.

W-What the hell did she say?

She thinks it's cool
you're following your dream,

no matter what.

That bitch!

How do you want
to handle it?

Um, okay.

Tell Bernadette to tell Priya
that I'm on my way to Prague

to shoot a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

Got it.

Is it going
to be in 3-D?

What? I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

I'm gonna say 3-D.

That'll let her know
the studio has faith in it.

You're kidding. 3-D?

That's what I hear.

Then the studio
must have real faith in it.

Wonder why she
didn't <i>tell</i> me.

Have you been spending time
with your ex-girlfriend?

No...

Then why are you surprised
she didn't tell you?

Well, it's not as much
"surprised" as

you know...
uh... the other thing.

What other thing?

Well, if you... uh...

I don't... oh...

What's the word I'm looking for?

I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.

She's also dating an astronaut.

Wow. That's very impressive.

Yeah. But Leonard's
impressive, too.

Thank you.

"Befuddled."

The word I was looking for
was "befuddled."

Knight to old woman...

six-and-a-third.

Brilliant move.

Thank you.

Will the two of you excuse me?

I need a hug.

Sorry, I have company.

Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

I don't want to hug you.

I don't want to
hug you, either.

I was just
feeling blue.

Blue, as in depressed.

Well, not so much
depressed as lonely.

I don't know what
color lonely is.

- What?
- Red is angry;

yellow is frightened;

green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.

Perhaps we can assign
a color to lonely.

Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.

All right. Come in.

You look positively
orange with loneliness.

No, I don't see that
catching on at all.

What are you doing?

I'm working on my
three-person chess game.

Oh, cool. Can I play?

It's three-person chess.

Did you bring a friend?

No.

Then as a mental exercise
I invite you

to figure out why the two of us
can't play three-person chess.

Can you believe this guy?

Social protocol does, however,

require me to bring you
a hot beverage

in your time of need.

No, thank you. I'm fine.

It's not optional.

We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

I, uh, I guess you're probably
wondering what's got me down.

Actually, I was wondering

if I could add
a third new chess piece.

How do you think people
would feel about Prince Joey--

the king's feeble-minded
but well-meaning cousin?

I'm going to be 30 years old,

and I have no one in my life
to love me.

I'm such a basket case, I can't
even talk to a woman

without having alcohol
in my body.

The fun thing about
Prince Joey

is every time he moves,
there's a one-in-five chance

he'll kill himself.

Sheldon, listen to me.

I have a big decision to make,
and I'm scared.

Yellow. Go ahead.

A friend at the School
of Pharmacology

gave me these new pills
they're testing.

He says it's
the next big thing

for social anxiety disorder.

Fascinating.
What's in it?

I'm not sure.

Some sort of beta-blocker
attached to a molecule

extracted from
the urine of cows.

I like cows.

That's not the point.

It was its own
point. Go on.

I'm a scientist.

My ability to think
is my bread and butter.

I'm afraid if I take this,
I might lose

that special, unique something that
makes me so successful in my field.

Rajesh, I've had
the privilege

of working alongside
you for many years.

My recommendation is that you
gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

Okay, I'm still trying
to work this out.

How did Penny meet an astronaut?

I don't know.

The regular way
people meet astronauts.

Most of those
guys live in Texas.

Obviously, this one doesn't.

Okay.

Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.

People meet, Howard.
God!

Fine.

You've met lots of astronauts,

and I've never grilled you
about that.

I'd thank you to extend me
the same courtesy.

I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.

I still can't get over the fact
that she got a big movie part.

Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's
up to, 'cause I don't.

Maybe that's where she met
the astronaut, all right?

I'm sorry. What would an
astronaut be doing

working on a movie?

He's a consultant.

I thought the movie was
about 18th-century Vienna.

He can't have a hobby?!

Excuse me, I have to pee.

Or is that
implausible, as well?!

It's nice to have another
couple to hang with, isn't it?

All right, guys,
you have to go back.

I can't afford you.

No, don't send
us away; we love you.

I love you, too,
but you cost more than my rent.

But, Penny,
you look so good in us.

Damn it, the shoes are right.

Good golly, Penny,
your whimsy is boundless.

What do you got for me,
wildebeest?

I think they're on to me.

The story's starting
to fall apart.

Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

We may have
to kill her.

Bernadette, I'm putting
you on speakerphone.

Where are you now?

In the bathroom.

Oh, look at this, another one of
our classic bathroom gabfests.

What's the problem?

They're just asking me

all sorts of questions
I can't answer.

Just change the subject.

I suppose I could get them back
to talking about Leonard

going to India
to meet Priya's parents.

What?!

They said something about
going there this summer.

What, are they getting engaged?

I don't know. I was too busy
covering my heinie

on Amy's stupid
astronaut story!

What astronaut story?

You texted me Penny's
dating an astronaut.

I texted "architect."
That's amusing.

Auto-correct
must've changed it.

Yeah, it's hysterical.

All right, look, just forget
about the astronaut.

Architect. Where would you
have met an astronaut?

Look, just find out what's up
with this trip to India.

I don't want
to do this anymore!

Don't you quit on us!

Bernie, you okay?

It was an architect!

Thank you for coming
with me, Sheldon.

You're a good friend.

I'm glad you think so.

That's what I
strive to emulate.

Okay, let's see
if this drug works.

Can I help you?

Forgive me for staring,
but you're very beautiful.

Thank you.

That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

India.

Oh, cool.
I've always wanted to go there.

It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.

May I join you?

Uh, okay, sure.
Why not?

My name is Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali,

and this is my friend
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Hi.

There's no need
to interact with me.

I'm just here to observe.

What's he
observing?

We're scientists.
We observe everything.

Here, go buy yourself a scone.

All right.

- And what is your name?
- Angela.

Oh, derived from the word
"angel." Appropriate.

You're cute.

I'd like to buy a scone.

Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

We have muffins.

They sound delicious,

but this money
is earmarked for scones.

What are
you doing?!

Oh, just getting comfortable.

So how long have you
lived in Los Angeles?

I...

They were out of scones.

Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

You're being rude.

I'll bet you're an actress.

If not, you should be.

You have a very expressive face.

Oh, my God.

Wait, where are you going?

We were doing so well.

She never even got
to see my penis.

Ta-da!

Who wants some
more coffee?

Thanks, yeah.
Sure.

Let me help you.

Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

"Gals"?

Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

This trip to India
sounds fun.

Yeah, I think it will be.

Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

A little.

They're very old-fashioned.

Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

Oh, God, no.
We're not there yet.

Not engaged.
Very interesting.

I have to tinkle.

You've been in there
a lot tonight. Are you okay?

Yes.
Are you writing a book?

Why are you getting upset?

I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.

What's up with you?

Bernadette?

I can't do this anymore!

I'm a good girl!

I went to Catholic school!

Okay, well, it's getting late.

This was terrific.

You win.

Bernie?

I think the word you're
looking for is "befuddled."

My catapult flings my bishop

to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

Nice.

Okay, rook to transporter pad.

And he comes out at...

...Leonard's Queen's Bishop
five-and-a-third.

Check on Leonard.

Hang on.

When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

When it's done charging.

Or you land on
the time machine.

Obviously.

Oh, oh...

Beekeeper to King 12.

I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

Checkmate on Sheldon.

I knew I should've given
my pope the jet pack.

Hey, I've got winners.

Hey, do me a favor
and take table seven.

You mean the one
with my 118-pound

rock-hard stud of a fiancÃ©

who's prone to canker
sores and pinkeye?

Nah, I prefer to look at it as
the one with my ex-boyfriend

and his gorgeous, successful
and sophisticated girlfriend,

who makes me feel like
a toothless Okie.

Do you want me to spill
hot soup on her?

Oh, please-- you're not
that kind of person.

I know.

But if she orders
something low-fat

I'll totally give her
the full-fat version.

Uh, that's my water.

What?

My water.
You're drinking it.

D-Dear Lord!

Have you been drinking it?

Yes. It's my water.

Well, that's it then.

I'm dead.

Here we go...

I'm sorry, do I really need
to connect the dots for you?

The backwash into this glass

is every pathogen that calls
your mouth home, sweet home.

Not to mention the visitors who
arrive on the dancing tongue

of your subtropical girlfriend.

Hey! That's my sister

and my country
you're talking about.

Leonard may have
defiled one,

but I won't have you
talking smack about the other.

You guys ready to order?

Yes, I'd like a seven-day
course of penicillin,

some, uh, syrup of ipecac--
to induce vomiting-- and a mint.

I don't understand.

He drank from
Leonard's glass.

"He drank from
Leonard's glass"--

the words they'll be
carving into my tombstone.

That's actually my napkin.

Oh, this is a nightmare!

Where are you going?
To the bar,

to sterilize my mouth
with alcohol.

Gang way! Dead man walking!

All right. Here you go.

Two lemonades,

one iced tea

and a root beer for Priya.

- Is it diet?
- That's what you ordered.

Thank you.

Hey, have you and Howard

started planning
your wedding yet?

Yeah. We're thinking
of having it on a cliff

overlooking the ocean.

Nothing soothes
those pre-wedding jitters

like the thought
of falling and drowning.

What did your mother say

when you told her you were
getting married?

He hasn't told her yet.

He's waiting for
the right time.

I was thinking of weaving
it into her eulogy.

Howard, you've got
to tell your mother.

Hey, have you told your parents
you're dating

this short glass
of skim milk here?

Uh... that's different.

First of all,
we're not engaged;

and second,
Indian parents

are very protective
of their children.

Right, right,
whereas Jewish mothers

take a casual, la-di-da
approach to their sons.

I gargled with tequila and may
have swallowed a teeny bit.

- You all right?
- Fine.

Thank you for asking.

I love you so much.

Fire demon.

Ooh, fire demon.

Sheldon's turning up the heat...

Troll master.

Check it! Howard pulls one out

from under the bridge. Nice!

Water nymph.

Oh, yeah, she's got puddles

in all the right places.

Could you please
play the game

without commenting
on every card?

Sorry.

Walking tree.

Last one.

I'm taking a stroll
and I'm sporting wood.

Okay, the <i>Eagle</i> has landed.

What's going on?

Bernadette
and my mother are having

a get-to-know-you lunch
at the Old Town Deli.

Oh, that sounds lovely.

Hope so.

Of course, if history
is any indication,

my mother will swallow her whole

and spit out her bones
like an owl.

Have you met
Bernadette's parents?

You mean Adolf and Eva?

Not yet.

One goose step at a time.

Sheldon,
that's my water.

Oh, dear Lord!

That's not your water.

I know.

Where's the mouthwash?!

"Where" indeed.

Ma, I'm home!

Where are you?

I'm in the toilet!

So, how'd it go?!

Too soon to say!

I'm not done yet!

No, I mean lunch, today,
with Bernadette!

Oh!

I had a pastrami
sandwich.

She had eggplant lasagna.

Like that's what a person
orders in a Jewish deli.

Besides food, did you get along?
Did you talk?

Oh, sure! Did you know
she's going to school

to become a
microbiologist?!

No, she never mentioned it.

I bet she did and
you didn't listen!

Yeah, that's probably it.
So, what do you think?

Do you like her?
She's great, huh?

She's a lovely girl!

Cute as a button!

That's good to hear,
'cause I've got some news.

I hope it's
good news,

because I've got nothing but
disappointment in here!

Bernadette and I
are getting married.

Ma?

You too busy bearing down?

Ma?

Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

Stand back,
I'm gonna break the door down!

Son of a bitch!
Ma, help!

Hey.

Hello.

Haven't
seen you in a while.

How's it going?

Oh, other than waiting out
the exponential growth period

of the virulent organisms

trooping through
my microvilli

into my circulatory system--
hunky-dory.

Did I say something
amusing?

I don't know, maybe,
I have no idea what you said.

So your mirth is merely
a discharge of nervous energy

with no semantic content at all?

My mirth. Classic.

Is there a station
coming up

where I can board your
giggling train of thought?

It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

It's just,
ever since Leonard's been

dating Raj's sister,
I've had to keep my distance.

I don't get to hear
all your jibber-jabber.

Jibber-jabber?!

I don't jibber-jabber.

What are you doing
at work these days?

Oh, I'm working on
time-dependent backgrounds

in string theory,

specifically quantum
field theory

in "d-dimensional"
de Sitter space.

Okay, come on, even you have
to admit that's jibber-jabber.

Interesting, do you know

where the phrase
"jibber-jabber" comes from?

Oh, my God,
you're about to jibber-jabber

about jibber-jabber.

Howard and his mother
are at the hospital.

- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh, my God! What happened?

I don't know, I just got a text.
Come on, hurry.

Okay.

Sheldon, let's go!

To a hospital?!

Full of sick people?!

Oh, I don't think so.

Okay, well, your friend and his
mother are there, we're going.

I can't.

Oh, don't tell me you're
afraid of germs.

Not all germs.

Just the ones that will kill me.

It's the same way I'm not
afraid of all steak knives--

just the ones that might be
plunged in my thorax.

Fine, I'll tell Howard
you didn't come

because you're more concerned

about your own well-being
than his.

I would think
he would know that.

Okay, you know what?
You are unbelievable.

You buy all these
superhero T-shirts,

but when it's time for you

to step up
and do the right thing,

you just hide
in the laundry room.

Fine, I'll go.

Just for the record,
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

She went in to
visit my Uncle Roger,

caught something and bit
the dust a week later.

The two of them
now share a coffee can

on my mother's mantel.

So I knocked down
the bathroom door,

picked up my poor
unconscious mother,

carried her to the car,

and drove like a madman
to the emergency room.

You're a real
hero, Howard.

No, I did what
any son would do.

Hang on a second--
you picked up your mother?

Her own legs
are barely able to do that.

I was filled
with adrenaline.

It happens to be how women
lift cars off babies.

Yeah, I'm saying,
it'd be easier to lift a car.

What can I tell you?
After I found the courage

to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.

So, how is she?

They're running tests--
I don't know.

It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.

What's the difference?

A heart-attack-like event

is an event
that's like a heart attack.

Thanks for clearing that up.

Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.

What's more likely going
to kill Howard's mother

are the
antibiotic-resistant

super-bugs festering
in every nook and cranny

of this hospital.

Okay, you're not helping.

Disagree.

Go sit over there.

I'll sit over there--
it looks cleaner.

Is there a history of
heart disease in your family?

My family is the history
of heart disease.

There's a cave painting
in France

of one of my ancestors
doing this:

So it's probably genetic.

Well, maybe.

Mom also had just gotten some
news that might have upset her.

What?

It's not important.

Come on, Howard,
I'm going to be your wife.

You can share
anything with me.

You'd think that.
But no.

You told her we were
going to get married

and she had
a heart attack?

You can't take
that personally.

How else is she supposed
to take it?

What you've got to

keep in mind is that
ever since my dad left,

I've been the whole world
to my mother.

I mean, she'd be
threatened by any woman

who can give me
what she can't.

You mean sexual
intercourse?

Well, when you say it like
that you make it sound creepy.

What happened?

Howard's mother had
a heart attack

because I have
sex with him

and she can't.

Bernie, wait!

I'll give you $1,000
if you'll drive me home.

Nice of you to
come for Howard.

Well, he's my friend.
It's what you do.

I'm sorry, did
I miss something?

It's just so weird.

Howard Wolowitz
is my friend.

You know, once he tried to
stick his tongue down my throat

and I broke his nose.

That's a little easier
to believe

than he's your friend.

Yeah, tell me about it.

You know, my brother had a group
of friends like this in India.

They dressed up in leotards and
goggles and called themselves

the New Delhi
Power Rangers.

You mean when
he was little.

Not as little as
you'd want him to be.

You know,
this stuff is horrible.

You want to see if we
can find the cafeteria

and get real coffee?
Sure.

We're going to the cafeteria
to get some coffee.

You want anything?

I'm fine.

That's nice that
they're getting along.

Your girlfriend and your
ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

Oh, yeah, that can
only be good for you.

What are you talking about?

One of them
broke up with you.

Do you really want her
telling the other one why?

I don't care.

I don't have
anything to hide.

Good, good.

Then you have nothing
to worry about.

No, I do not.

You are a mean little man.

You'd think it'd be because
my parents didn't love me,

but actually they
loved me a great deal.

Bernie, it's not you.

She's just set
in her ways.

How can we be together
if the thought of us

getting married
might kill your mother?

It's the circle
of life, sweetie.

One day our son will marry
someone and it will kill you.

Howard, I have to go
to the bathroom

and no one
will take me home.

What's wrong with
the bathroom here?

Pneumococcus, streptococcus,
staphylococcus

and other assorted
coccuses.

Sheldon, my mother is
on her deathbed

and my fiancÃ©e is grief-stricken
over putting her there.

I'm not taking you home.

Will you at least

go with me to the restroom here,

so you can open the door
and flush the urinal?

No!

This might be a good time
to point out, Howard,

that friendship requires
a certain give and take.

Hold the door.

Mr. Wolowitz?

- Is she okay?
- It wasn't a heart attack.

She's awake, she's
resting comfortably--

we're still
running a few tests.

Can I see her?

Actually, she said,
and I quote,

she'd "like to see the
little Catholic girl first."

Me? Why me?

Jews have been asking
that for centuries.

There's no real good answer.

Okay, well,
wish me luck.

Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

If it touches her, it burns.

You brought a Catholic girl
home to your mother?

Yeah.

Why don't I write you a
prescription for Xanax.

Finally.

Oh, what fresh hell is this?

Wait, you can't leave here,
you've been exposed.

No, I haven't.

It's all good.

You want to talk
about crazy mothers,

Leonard's mom wouldn't give him
any sort of approval growing up.

Oh, the poor thing.

It makes him desperate
to please women.

That's why the foreplay
goes on and on.

It does, doesn't it?

It's like he's
trying to win a prize.

A word of advice--
don't doze off.

You will never hear
the end of it.

Help me!

Come back!

Penny!

There are a couple of
things I did with Penny

that might be a
little silly, but...

Like what?

Every once in a while,
before we'd go to bed,

I'd put on a little show
for her.

What do you mean
"a show"?

Well, you know,
the way I took my clothes off.

Like, to music?

I'd look pretty stupid
if there was no music.

So you'd do
a striptease?

I wasn't swinging
around a pole.

Good, good.

There was one time
I put body glitter on.

Well, I don't think
you have to worry

about Penny telling
my sister that.

No, she wouldn't.

Your big problem
is me telling her.

You really are
a mean little man.

Oh, God, that's so true.

I know, right?

Hey, what took
you guys so long?

Oh, we were
just chatting.

That's nice.
What about?

We were just
comparing notes

about how you are
in the sack.

That's funny.
Yeah.

What if she
wasn't kidding?

It doesn't matter.

I'm the king of foreplay.

Hey, how'd it go?

You're a putz.

You know what that means?

Yeah. Do you?

Your mother just
taught it to me.

She thinks she got food
poisoning from that deli

and she just wanted
to make sure I was okay.

And are you?

No, because I'm
engaged to a putz.

You let me believe I was the
reason she had a heart attack.

Well, based on the
available evid--

Shut up!

She said I'm
a wonderful girl

and that you're
lucky to have me.

Where are you going?

To the toilet!

Is that okay with you?!

Is it just me, or does she
sound sexy when she's angry?

Mountain Elf.

He takes the elf
from off the shelf.

Hell Hounds.

Hell Hounds-- who let
the Satanic dogs out?

Who? Who-who?

Colossal Serpent.

I got a colossal
serpent right here.

Must you?

Sorry, I'm just trying
to cheer my buddy up.

Rotting Zombie.

Sheldon's new
Facebook photo.

Zandor, Wizard of the North.

Ha! I win.

If you skip the part about being

under a two-week quarantine
because you were exposed

to a deadly disease--
absolutely.

Hey, you guys ready to order?

Uh, sure.
Okay, Priya?

Uh, I'll have
the shepherd's pie.

You want to split
that with me?

Oh, no, no, no,
he doesn't.

Why not?

Well, you have milk in
the taters,

milk in the gravy,
parmesan crust.

Your lactose-intolerant
boyfriend will turn

into a gas-filled
Macy's Day balloon.

Not quite accurate. The Macy's
balloons are filled with helium,

whereas Leonard produces copious
amounts of methane.

So, no, on the shepherd's pie.
Can we move on?

Yeah, a little tip:
he says he can eat frozen yogurt.

Do not believe it.

Sea bass!
I'll have the sea bass!

You gotta like this,

the girlfriend and the
ex-girlfriend bonding

over your rooty-tooty
stinky booty.

Kill me.

It wouldn't help.
The human body is capable

of being flatulent for hours
after death.

Guys, sorry I'm late.
I have amazing news.

Bernadette, before you
change the subject,

does anyone have any
final comments on

Leonard's faulty
digestive system?

So, what's your news,
Bernadette?

The thesis committee accepted
my doctoral dissertation.

I'm getting my PhD!

Wow!
Oh, congratulations.

Wow, so that means you're a
doctor, you're a doctor,

you're a doctor,
you're a doctor,

and Howard,
you know a lot of doctors.

Congratulations, honey.

Thank you.

So, Howard, tell us,
how's it feel knowing

that when you two get married,

you'll be referred to
as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

Unless he takes Bernadette's
last name.

And considering
her advanced status,

that could open
some doors for him.

Please, this isn't about me.
I'm proud of you.

Well, you'll be
really be proud of this.

I was headhunted by a big
pharmaceutical company.

They're gonna pay me
a buttload of money!

What?

Bernadette, that's great.

Howard, do you make a buttload?

Better than what you've
got a buttload of.

Hey, if I roll down the windows
in the car, everything's peachy.

If you do it,
you're still not a doctor.

Yeah, just a heads-up
on the car window deal.

It helps, but everything is
not "peachy."

âª Our whole universe

Shh, my brother's
going to hear you.

Relax, he's got
headphones on.

And we're ten miles above
Earth in a starship.

Really, ten miles?

You're orbiting inside
the atmosphere?

Moron.

I can't believe
I'm wearing

my brother's Halloween costume.

I can't believe you think
he only wears it on Halloween.

Open the landing bay doors,
shuttle craft approaching.

Okay, gotta go.

Hey, what's up?

Is that my future
daughter-in-law, the doctor?!

No, Ma! It's Raj!

He's a doctor
too, right?!

Yes!

Like Leonard and
the skinny weirdo!

Sheldon, yes!

Everybody's a doctor but me!

Well, whose fault
is that?!

What's up?

Leonard's putting disgusting
memories in

my memory foam mattress.

Can I stay here tonight?

Sure, but I'm going out
with Bernadette.

It'll just be you and my mother.

I guess that's okay.

Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

Of course, he and I
can play doctor!

She's kidding, right?

I don't know, she's pretty
feisty since

they put her on
hormone-replacement therapy.

Paging Dr.
Cutie Pie!

I must say, Amy,
I was very impressed

to see that Bernadette got
her PhD.

It's indeed admirable.

Although, it is...
microbiology.

Your doctorate is in
neurobiology.

I fail to see the distinction.

I'll make it simple for you.

I study the brain,

the organ responsible for
Beethoven's <i>Fifth Symphony.</i>

Bernadette studies yeast,

the organism responsible
for Michelob Lite.

Is there something wrong
with your neck?

It's a little stiff.

What a remarkably fragile
structure

to support
such a valuable payload.

Not unlike balancing a Faberge
egg on a Pixie Stick.

Have you considered massage?

I'd like to respond
to that sarcastically:

Yes, I relish the thought
of a stranger covering my body

with oil and rubbing it.

I was proposing you massage your
muscles with your own hands.

Still sounds like a lot
of unnecessary touching.

Trust me. With your right hand,
locate the spot

where the scapula meets
the acromion process.

All right.

Now push your third finger along
the ridge of the shoulder blade,

making a small rotation
as you do so.

Rotating.

You should feel
a small node-like object

rolling back and forth along
the bone.

You mean the myofascial point?

Obviously.

Now bear down on it like
the seventh grade noogies

we all know too well.

Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes,
oh, yes!

Amy, I've never been touched
like this before!

Oh! My hands are magic!

Don't flatter yourself.

Your hands are blunt tools
guided by my knowledge

of the nervous system.

I could just as easily have
paralyzed you.

There's someone at my door.

That doesn't interest me.
Good-bye.

- Can I sleep here tonight?
- Why?

Leonard's having
astronomically inaccurate

<i>Star Trek</i> sex with my sister.

I can see how that would be
upsetting. Come in.

I'll get the sheets
and blankets for the couch.

Oh, don't bother.
I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

No, I can't authorize that.

Well, he's in my bed.
Why can't I be in his?

The Hammurabic Code is
"an eye for an eye,"

not "a bed for a bed."

Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,
and Tyra Banks says

the most important item in your
makeup bag is

a good night's sleep.

All right.

This is a form
indemnifying me

from your use of
"Leonard's bedroom."

Sign here, indicating
that I tried to stop you

and did so using
a stern facial expression.

Good night, Sheldon.

Wait. Not yet.

We still have to go over
safety procedures.

Now, the apartment has three
emergency exits located

here, here, and here.

In the event of a power outage,

luminous paint will guide you
to the nearest exit.

You're kidding.

I never kid about safety.

What are you doing here?

I was sleeping.

In my bed?

Well, I would've slept
in my own bed,

but it was being used
to bring shame to my family.

And the memory
of Gene Roddenberry.

Oh, you heard?

"Scotty, I need more power."

Sorry. Does Sheldon know
you're sleeping in here?

Are you kidding?
He made me sign a waiver,

participate in
an emergency fire drill

and take a refresher course
in CPR.

Thank God he had a dummy.

Oh, yeah.
Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

You know,
she used to date Howard?

Oh, my God, she's <i>that</i> Mona?

Why can't you and my sister
spend your nights here?

We tried. She doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

Sheldon doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

It's still no reason
for me to have to listen to you

arm your
photon torpedoes every night.

Okay, well, how about this:
until Priya gets her own place,

you stay here and I'll stay at
your apartment.

Can I bring girls here?

You?

Sure. Bring as many as you want.

Okay, deal.

Just not against their will.

You really think you should be
eating that cake?

Why?

If you're gonna be

a trophy husband
for a rich wife,

you might want
to watch your waistline.

He's right.

A minute on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

Yeah, ha-ha.

First of all, I'm not threatened
by my fiancÃ©e's success.

I'm proud of her.

And secondly,
I have my own career.

Until you have kids.

Good news, Raj.

I got the blood work
back from the lab.

You're okay to stay for a while.

When did you take my blood?

Not important.

Your sugar was a little high.

I'd follow up
with your regular physician.

In the meantime, I have some
paperwork here

for you to go over.

What the hell is this?

Boilerplate stuff.

A modified roommate agreement
for a temporary house guest.

And a living will and durable
power of attorney.

This says you can make
"end of life" decisions for me.

As your friend, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

Please sign.

Did you sign this?

There's a reciprocity
clause.

You get to pull
the plug on him, too.

Well, that seems fair.

Congratulations and welcome
temporarily aboard.

Here's your I.D. card,

your key and your lapel pin.

Which Leonard was
too cool to wear.

FYI, part of your
responsibilities

as roommate pro tem
will be to drive me

to and from work, the comic book
store, the barbershop

and the park for one hour every
other Sunday for fresh air.

Bring a ball or a Frisbee,

you know, something
he can chase.

Also, you're tasked
with bringing home

all takeout dinners.

Tonight is Thai food.

You'll find the standard order
in appendix B

or downloadable
from my FTP server.

If you have
any questions,

here's the FAQ sheet,

or if you prefer
the human touch,

I do a live web chat called
"Apartment Talk"

on Tuesday nights.

No backsies.

Sheldon, dinner!

What is this?

This is the difference
between

eating and dining.

Remarkable.
I'm just realizing how much

Leonard's been skating by
all these years.

It's not a big thing.

Just think of me as
a brown Martha Stewart.

Hey, Sheldon,

did you change
your Wi-Fi password again?

Yes, it's "Penny, get your
own Wi-Fi." No spaces.

Thanks.

Wow! What's with
the fancy spread?

My new roommate
is bending over backwards

to ingratiate himself to me.

Uh, nice touch,
by the way.

What do you mean "new roommate"?
What happened to Leonard?

The same thing that happened
to Homo erectus.

He was replaced
by a superior species.

I'm the new Homo in town.

That came out wrong.

All right, let me try this
again. Where's Leonard?

He's living at my place,
so I'm living here.

You're living here
provisionally.

But I must say
it's looking good.

Oh Leonard and Priya
are living together?

That's big.

No. Origami napkin swans...

that's the headline.

It's a good thing.

So do you know what kind
of research you'll be doing

at this pharmaceutical
company?

Well, there are a couple of
opportunities available,

but I volunteered for the
premature ejaculation project.

I mean, it's not like either
one of us has heart disease.

Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a little present.

Oh, Bernie, no.
You didn't have to.

I wanted to.
Come on, open it.

You bought me a Rolex?

How much did this cost?

Oh, you let me worry
about the money.

I just want my baby
to have pretty things.

More wine?

Oh, no, no, no. I've had
way too much already.

Here's an interesting
fact about alcohol...

Hit me.

Man is not the only species

that ferments fruit
in order to become intoxicated.

Can you guess what the other is?

Hint: sometimes they pack
the alcohol

in their trunks.

Monkeys.

When does a monkey
have a trunk?

When a suitcase just won't do.

Mmm, all right.

It would appear as if alcohol

is playing keep-away
with your intelligence.

Good night.

Please note,
it is now past 10:00 p.m.

Per our roommate agreement,
kindly refrain

from raucous laughter,

clinking of glasses,
and celebratory gunfire.

Okay...

explain something to me.

You watch Leonard put up with
that guy for years and years.

What has to break inside
your brain for you to think,

"Oh, Krishna, I've got to
get me some of that"?

Well, it's a lot better than

having to wear noise-cancelling
headphones in my own apartment.

What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

Leonard's a noisy little dude
in the sack.

Every night.
Really?

Even during allergy season,
when he has to alternate

between kissing and breathing?

It's my sister. Can we not
talk about this anymore?

Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

Can I tell you a secret?

Yeah.

I screwed up.

Leonard's a great guy.

Never should have
broken up with him.

Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare

"It's better to have
loved and lost

"than to stay home every night
and download

increasingly shameful
pornography."

Ohh... you poor baby.

What's wrong with me, Penny?

Nothing, nothing.

You know, if we weren't friends,

and you hadn't brought up
that creepy pornography story,

I'd be on you like

the speed of light squared
on matter to make energy.

Hey, you totally got that right!

"E=mc2."

I listen.

I have no idea what it means,
but I listen.

To friendship.
To friendship.

Would you booze hounds
please stop that infernal clinking?!

And the answer
was elephant!

Mmm.

Leonard, sweetheart, we're
kissing, not eating hot soup.

Sorry.

That's my parents
on video chat.

Go hide
in the bedroom.

Oh, come on!

Why don't we just tell
them that we're dating?

Oh, we've been through this.
It's not the time.

When is the time?

I've got five brothers
and sisters.

One of them is bound
to screw up real big,

and then I'll tell my parents
about you. Now, shoo.

Fine.

Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

We heard there was a tornado
in Kansas City.

Is that close to you?

No.

Where is your brother?

Out with friends.

I don't like it, a young girl
alone in an apartment.

I'll sleep so much better when
you move back here next month.

You're moving
back to India?!

Who's that?

Oh, my God! There's someone
in your apartment.

Call the police in America!

When were you going
to tell <i>me</i> about this?

Oh, hello, Leonard.

What a pleasant surprise!

Mummy, Daddy, you remember
Rajesh's friend Leonard.

I thought you said Rajesh
was out with his friends.

He has many friends.

Rajesh has many friends?

Why are you lying to us?

She's lying because she doesn't
want you to know we're dating.

Leonard!

Well, what difference
does it make? If you're

moving back to India,
we're obviously breaking up.

You know what?

I don't want to deal
with this right now.

So...

Hot in India?

Of course it is.
It always is. It's India.

Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

Uh...

That is a beautiful tapestry.

Oh, God.

Oh, God!

Oh.

Okay, look.

This never happened.

Do you understand me?

Really?! Still
can't talk to me?

What are you
doing here?

What?

I said, what are you doing here?

I live here.

I have paperwork
that says differently.

Priya's going back to India.

Irrelevant.

Rajesh and I have
a good thing going

and you're not going to ruin it.

What are you doing here?

I've been up all night.

- I had a fight with Bernadette.
- Why?

She gave me
a beautiful watch.

Leonard, do you
understand this?

Yes.

Talk to him.

Damn.

What's going on?

Oh...

It's-it's not what
it looks like.

What does it look like?

NARRATOR: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory:

My brother...

...he's got a big crush on Bernadette.

You're moving back to India?

What's going on?

[CHUCKLES]

It's not what it looks like.

[DOOR OPENS AND THEN CLOSES]

What does it look like?

It's not what it looks like.

It's not what it looks like.

What are you grinding about?

Penny's brain teaser this morning.

She and Koothrappali
emerge from your bedroom.

She is disheveled and Raj
is dressed only in a sheet.

The sole clue: It's not
what it looks like.

Tsk, just let it go, Sheldon.

If I could, I would, but
I can't, so I shan't.

Now...

...knowing Penny, the obvious
answer is they engaged in coitus.

But since that's what it looks
like, we can rule that out.

Let's put on our thinking caps,
shall we?

Raj is from India, a tropical
country, third-world hygiene...

...parasitic infections are
common, such as pinworms.

- Mm-hm.
- The procedure for diagnosing pinworms...

...is to wait until the
subject is asleep...

...and the worms crawl out
of the rectum for air.

Yes, just like that.

Penny could have been inspecting
Raj's anal region for parasites.

Oh, boy, that's a true-blue friend.

They slept together, Sherlock.

[HICCUPS]

No, you weren't listening.

She said, "it's not what it looks like."

She lied.

Oh.

Now don't I look silly
sitting here wearing this?

_H6Y-
_H6Y...

H93'...

H93'...

Leonard, is it awkward for you...

...knowing one of your dear
friends had sexual intercourse...

...with a woman you used to love in
the very place you lay your head?

No, I'm fine with it.

That sounds like sarcasm.

But I'm gonna disregard it because
I have an agenda. Paintball.

Specifically, the interdepartmental
tournament this weekend.

Now, in order to function
better as a fighting unit...

...I thought we should
establish a chain of command.

Now, it goes without saying that I
would outrank the three of you.

But the question remains,
by how much?

Now, I don't see me as some
four-star general back at HQ...

...riding a desk and playing golf
with the Secretary of Defense.

But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper
because that might lead you...

...to think of me as a regular Joe. This
might take some thought. As you were.

- What the hell is wrong with you?
- How could you do that?

- What is it to you?
- I got his back.

Yeah, right.
You're jealous because...

...I'm Penny's number-two
choice after Leonard.

Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette,
that totally could have been me.

Please. Sheldon would've
been before you...

...and he might not even
have genitals.

Why do you care so much?
You're dating my sister...

...and Penny and I are in love.

- What, heh?
- What?

Gentlemen, if I may interject.

I've decided my rank will be captain.

If it's good enough for Kirk,
Crunch and Kangaroo...

...it's good enough for me.

- You're not in love with Penny.
- Yes, I am.

The god Kamadeva has shot us
with his flowery arrows of love.

- Who?
- He's the Hindu version of Cupid...

...but way better because
he rides a giant parrot.

Raj, come on, you fall in love
with any girl who smiles at you.

A month ago, you were writing
poems about his fiancee.

I'm sorry, what?

Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

<i>[MIMICKING RAJESH] Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet</i>

That could have been about anyone.

You have nothing to worry about,
because now I'm the dusky half...

...of Koothrapenny.

For the record, I do have genitals.

They're functional and
aesthetically pleasing.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Oh. Coming.

Yup, that's good.

Wine glasses should have handles.

Keeping accurate track
of your alcohol intake.

Smart idea, considering how trampy
you get when you've had a few.

You heard what I did?

- Well, I heard who you did.
- Ugh.

Oh, my God, I screwed up everything.

I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj. I
mean, what is wrong with me?

I feel like two totally different people.

Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

- Know the story of Catherine the Great?
- No.

She ruled Russia in the late 1700s, and
one night when she was feeling randy...

...she used an intricate system of pulleys
to have intimate relations with a horse.

I'm sorry, what does
this have to do with me?

She engaged in inter-species
hanky-panky...

...and people still call her great.

I'm sure your reputation can survive
you shagging a little Indian boy.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

You jerk-face!

What did you tell Howard?

You say there's something going on between us?
He thinks there is.

He's completely freaking out!

Please, come in.

What the hell is wrong with you?

You were always so nice to me,
I thought maybe you liked me.

I'm nice to everyone!

- I'm sorry.
- Damn right, you're sorry.

And you tell Howard there's
never been anything between us.

I will. Hey, Bernadette.

- What?
- Do you think I have a shot with Penny?

Of course, you do. You're a cutie pie.
Any girl would be lucky to have you.

You know, I've done this before.

In kindergarten, I was supposed
to marry Jason Sorensen...

...but by the time my class got out there,
he was engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

What did I do? Hung upside
down from the monkey bars...

...let all the boys see my underpants.

You can't blame yourself.

When your pre-frontal cortex
fails to make you happy...

...promiscuity rewards you
with dopamine.

We neurobiologists refer to
this as the skank reflex.

- You know what? Let's get out of here.
- Where are we going?

Somewhere
where no one's seen me naked.

We may have to drive a while.

Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?

Oh, can I stay at your
place for a few nights?

Really? A best-friend sleepover? Yay.

Yeah, sure. Yay, heh.

We'll make popcorn, stay up all night,
and I'll teach you my secret language.

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

- Sounds great.
- Nope. Sounds:

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.
- No, you're not. You're gonna:

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

Do we really have to wear this
camouflage crap to play paintball?

Who said that? Leonard, I can hear
your voice, but I can't see you.

I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

Oh, there you are.

Leonard, I know you're upset
about recent events...

...and I have someone here to help.

I don't wanna talk to Amy.

Yeah... No, it's not Amy.

<i>Hello, dear.</i>

You called my mother?

Oh, Leonard, is it really
necessary to caption the obvious?

<i>He's been like that
since he was a toddler.</i>

<i>"Look, Mommy, a butterfly."</i>

<i>Maddening.</i>

What's going on?
What do you want'?

<i>Sheldon informed me that you're
experiencing an emotional upheaval</i>

<i>...and I'm here to help.</i>

That's so nice.

<i>And we're back to the obvious.</i>

<i>Now, what's up?</i>

Well, uh...

Okay, um...

I don't wanna get back with Penny.

We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work.

But I can't deal with the fact that
she slept with my friend, Raj.

And then I find out that
Raj's sister, Priya...

...who I've been going outwith,
is moving back to India.

So I'm just completely confused
and alone.

<i>I understand.</i>

- Got any advice?
- Yes. <i>Buck</i> up.

Excuse me, you're a
world-renowned expert...

...in parenting and child development,
and all you've got is "buck up"?

<i>Sorry.</i>

<i>Buck up, sissy pants.</i>

<i>- Thanks, Mother, I feel better.
- If you need any more help...</i>

<i>...my books are available on Amazon.</i>

<i>Logging off.</i>

Ninety-nine...

...100.

It's like a waterfall of liquid gold.

My turn.

[CLEARS THROAT]

[SIGHS]

Don't know what the point
of staying in L.A. is.

I haven't gotten a single acting
job since I moved out here.

The closest I came was last month. I got
a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.

Oh, I could so see you being
the face of hemorrhoids.

I know, right?

Ugh, maybe I should just
move back to Nebraska.

- No, I can't let you do that.
- Why not?

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

For the first time ever, I
have a thriving social life.

And no pressure, but it kind
of lives and dies with you.

Hi, Amy, can I talk to Penny?

A guest in my trundle bed
and a boy at my door?

I wish I could tell 13-year-old
me it does get better.

- How did you know I was here?
- It's all over her Facebook page.

- I'll take your stuff and clear a drawer.
- All right, thanks.

No problem. Try and keep
it in your pants, okay?

O

Hi, what's up?

Wondering if you're free Friday. They're
having '80s night at the Greek.

Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves,
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

Oh, heh.

- That's really sweet, but the thing is...
- Oh, there's a thing.

Look, honey, I was really drunk and
made a huge mistake last night.

We should have never slept together.
It's what ruins friendships.

You can't ruin a friendship with sex.

That's like trying to ruin ice
cream with chocolate sprinkles.

Come here. Just...

Listen to me. I...

I wanna go back
to the way we were before.

You know, friends.

No sprinkles.

Oh.

- All right.
- Thank you.

[SIGHS]

Well, uh...

[CLEARS THROAT]

...as your friend, you might
like to know that, um...

...we didn't have sex in
the conventional sense.

Oh, God, did you pull some
weird Indian crap on me?

No, no.

After we got undressed
and jumped in bed...

...you asked if I had protection.

- Oh, you did, didn't you?
- Well, of course. I'm always packing.

Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on...

...and you tried to help, and...

That was all she wrote.

- So we didn't actually-
- I did. It was beautiful.

Oh.

Penny, promise me you won't
tell anybody about this.

- Of course, I won't.
- Oh, good.

[SIGHS]

And, uh, can I tell people that our
love burned too bright and too quickly?

<i>Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?</i>

- Sure.
- Oh, good.

It fell apart because you're all,
"I wanna have your babies"...

...and I was like: "I'm too
rock 'n' roll to be tied down"?

No.

Can I say I ruined you for white men?

Also no.

- Okay, just the candle thing.
- Yeah.

Cool.

All right.

- Friend
- Hmm.

- I'll see you around.
- Okay.

Raj, wait.

Thank you for being my friend.

- Penny.
- Mm-hm.

It's getting beautiful again.

All right. This is a Google Earth
view of the field of battle.

- I don't see anything.
- Give it a second to load.

Whenever you're ready, AT&T.

Okay, here we go. This is us, here.

To the south is Professor Loomis
and the Geology Department.

According to their Twitter feed,
they're out of sunblock...

...which means they'll have to hug
the tree line or risk melanoma.

That's our edge. All we have to do
is move quickly over this ridge.

The rock-worshipping, pasty-faced
bastards won't know what hit them.

Let's move out.

Hang on, Sheldon.

How could you not tell me your
sister was moving back to India?

Maybe he was busy writing
clumsy penis metaphors...

...about my fiancÃ©e.

Screw you. That was a
beautifully-written penis metaphor.

You know what? Guys, I'm not
in the mood for paintball.

- What do you say we just bag it?
- Fine.

- Sure, whatever.
- But you can't quit.

That's a court-martial offense.
That's punishable by...

You can't quit.

I'm sorry, Sheldon, it's just not
a good time for playing games.

This is a game to you?

Uh, was the Battle of
Antietam a game, huh?

Was the Sack of Rome a game?

Yes, no and no.

Wait.

I just want you all to
know that I forgive you.

This mutiny isn't your fault.

It's mine.

I haven't earned these bars.

Although what I lack in leadership,
I more than make up for in sewing.

Let it go, Sheldon. I'll get you
a Jamba Juice on the way home.

No. Jamba Juice is for heroes.

And that's what we're going to be.

What are you doing?

Following in the footsteps of
Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

Geology isn't a real science.

[AIR RIFLES FIRING]

- Damn those sons of bitches!
LEONARD: Let's get them!

[ALL SHOUTING]

If there's ever a church of Sheldon,
this will be when it started.

Qw!

I'd like to propose a toast to
the man whose noble sacrifice...

...inspired our victory,
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

- Cheers!
- Excuse me, it's Major Sheldon Cooper.

With my last breath, I awarded
myself a battlefield promotion.

It's kind of a big deal.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Hi. You guys have a minute?

- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Okay, um...

[CLEARS THROAT]

Well, I already talked to Raj, but I
wanted to apologize to the rest of you...

...for, you know, everything.

Please, Penny, let me.

[CLEARS THROAT]

We've decided to let our crazy,
wonderful night together...

...be just one of those
memories you have...

...and can call to mind when you're
feeling blue or you're in the shower.

Hey, what you doing, quick draw?

Sorry. Go on.

[PENNY CLEARS THROAT]

Anyways, I wanted you to know that I've
been taking a really hard look at things...

...and come to the conclusion I
have to stop kidding myself.

I suck at acting.

It's time for me
to move back to Nebraska.

- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

What are you gonna do in Nebraska?

I don't know. Maybe teach acting.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

Sorry. Hold on. Hello?

I hope you're not doing this
because of you and me...

...because I have a girlfriend
and you're a single...

Shh! It's my agent. It's my agent.
You're kidding.

Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it.
Really?

Oh, I'm so excited. Thank you.

Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

I got the hemorrhoid commercial.
I start Monday.

What about Nebraska?

Oh, hell with Nebraska.
I'm gonna be a star.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

Have you ever thought
of teaching physics?

<i>Ready to ride ?</i>

<i>I don't think so, Mom.</i>

<i>Not today.</i>

<i>Oh, sweetie.</i>

<i>Hemorrhoids acting up again?</i>

<i>You don't know the half of it.</i>

<i>Oh, yes, I do.</i>

<i>Try a dab of this.</i>

<i>"Rose-scented Preparation-H
for women ? "</i>

<i>Now, the H is for her.</i>

- I'm proud of you.
- Shh. Here comes my joke.

<i>How you doing?</i>

<i>Sitting pretty.</i>

[English - US - SDH]

- What are you doing?
- Oh, Priya's calling in a few minutes...

...on Skype and we are
gonna have a dinner date.

It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai.

How can she have dinner?

Whatever.
Priya will be having breakfast.

All right. So technically,
it's not a dinner date.

I suppose you could call
it a, uh, dinfast date.

But if you did, you'd open
yourself to peer-based mocking...

...such as, "Hey, Leonard, how was
your dinfast with Priya last night?"

That doesn't sound like mocking.

You didn't let me finish.

Dinfast.

Are those soy-based candles?

I don't know. Why?

Paraffin candles
may contain carcinogens.

Unless lung cancer is the ambiance
you were going for at your dinfast.

Dinfast.

I don't wanna be rude, but
Priya's gonna be calling, so...

Oh, yes. Priya.

Leonard, you know I make a point...

...of never interfering
in your personal affairs.

Yes, I've always admired that
aboutyou.

As well you should.

But I'm going to make
an exception here.

Oh, good.

Priya has moved back to India
to pursue her law career.

Instead of desperately trying to keep this
intercontinental relationship alive...

...you could use that
time to take up a hobby.

- A hobby?
- Yes.

I read recently about a fellow in
Kansas with an enormous ball of twine.

I bet you could give him
a run for his money.

You know, some people might say...

...that it's great that we're
trying to make things work.

They'd say things like, "Love is
stronger than the miles between you."

When I rise to power, those
people will be sterilized.

You video chat with Amy all the time.
How is this different?

Don't you like Amy?

- Of course, I like Amy.
- Well, there's the difference.

[SKYPE RINGS]

Excuse me, that's Priya.

- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, honey.

<i>- I miss you.
- Oh, I miss you too.</i>

I miss the old days...

...when your romantic partners could
be returned to the video store.

Thanks for letting me stay here while
Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

Oh, it's no problem.

It's actually kind of nice.
You reading, me reading.

We're like an old married couple.

If we were an old married couple...

...the wife would serve iced
tea and snickerdoodles.

I don't have iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

A good wife would go to the store.

I want a divorce.

Good. On the way to see the lawyer,
pick up some tea and cookies.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

I must say,
I am enjoying your new chair.

- Oh, it's great, isn't it'?
- It is.

Aligns the lumbar, cradles the
coccyx, balances the buttocks.

- This is a chair worthy of the name.
- What name?

Chair.

Well, I'm glad you like it.

I mean, I still can't get over the
fact someone just threw it away.

- What?
- It was just sitting on the street.

I paid a homeless guy to
help me get it up here.

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

- What is wrong?
- I've been sitting in garbage.

Sheldon, take it easy.

You take it easy. I need
to use your shower.

I went into this marriage
with so much hope.

There's a wet Band-Aid
on the shower floor.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Heh, this is fun. I've never used a
hydraulic thermoforming press before.

It's pretty sweet, huh?

This little baby set the university
back a hundred and seventy-five grand.

That's three minutes.

- Should we see what we got?
- Hang on.

Oh, yeah.
This is one good-looking panini.

- Hand me the tuna melt.
- Yup.

Thank you.

How's it going with the
long-distance love affair?

It's not easy,
but we're making it work.

When you say making it work...

...does that include
doing the cyber-nasty?

- What?
- You know, the virtual pickle tickle, heh.

The digital:

[HUMMING PORN MUSIC]

Dude, this is my sister
you're talking about.

Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk
at her through a webcam...

...has gotta be easier to deal with
than him touching her with it.

There's no junk-jiggling. We just talk.

Are you insane? With high-speed Internet,
you have at your fingertips...

...the greatest advancement in the field of
sex since the invention of the washcloth.

I can't do that.

Heh, well, if you don't,
you're gonna lose Priya...

...to some fancy guy in a turban...

...who grew up with Kama
Sutra coloring books.

How can you be so racist?

Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

Oh, Leonard, good, there you are.

I need you to check my
head for chair lice.

I did it last night, I'm
not doing it again.

Just his head, right?

I don't wanna talk about it.

You didn't catch bugs
from Penny's chair.

Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting
at the base of my hair follicles...

...like dancing hippies at
the Redwood National Forest.

Sheldon, you do this all the time.

You fixate on some crazy idea and
then blow it way out of proportion.

Name one time I've ever done that.

How about when you put GPS
trackers in your garbage...

...because you were convinced North
Korean spies were stealing your doodles.

The chicken nuggets you were
sure were human nuggets.

The strangely-shaped cloud that
was following you around town.

The time you put on my shirt...

...and were convinced you'd
started growing again.

I said name one. You really need
to work on your listening skills.

Penny.Penny.Penny.

Hello.

You need to remove that chair from the building.
It's a health hazard.

I took off the slipcovers, had them
dry-cleaned and fumigated the cushions.

- Really?
- Yeah, it's cleaner than my couch.

Found half a Hot Pocket in there.

It certainly looks okay.

Has a strong toxic chemical smell.

- That's reassuring.
- Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?

All right.

Oh.

It is a comfortable chair.

Why don't you just admit
you overreacted?

No, thank you.

It's like living with a Chihuahua.

Penny.Penny.Penny.

What's up, buttercup?

- You have to get rid of the chair. You...
- Nope.

Penny.Penny.Penny.

What's the word, hummingbird?

For your safety...

...please wait in my apartment
as I call the authorities...

...so they may remove
the chair of death.

No.

Penny.Penny.Penny.

What's the gist, physicist?

Under my authority as a
self-appointed member...

...of the Centers for Disease
Control street team...

...these premises are condemned.

As a man with a keen sense of style...

...I must tell you, that chair
does not work with the room.

Penny.Penny.

[SCREAMS]

Penny.

So here we are. Back in bed together.

<i>Yep, here we are.</i>

[CLEARS THROAT]

- Okay, so I guess I'll justjump right in
- All right.

You're a naughty girl...

...and I wanna punish you
with my love.

<i>What?</i>

<i>- Not good?
- That's terrible. Try again.</i>

Okay. Uh, uh, you're not naughty, uh...

You're dirty.

You're...

You're a dirty girl?

<i>Oh, yes. Yes, lam.</i>

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. You're a...
You're a...

You're a dirty...

...disgusting, revolting girl.

[G ROANS]

<i>- God, Leonard. Stop talking.
- Why don't you give me five minutes?</i>

I'll Google how to do this,
I'll call you right back.

Shh...

<i>Just be quiet and
do what I tell you.</i>

Okay, like usual, good.

<i>Take off your shirt.</i>

Alright)'...

Shirt coming off.

Ta-da. Man nipples.

[CHUCKLES]

<i>- I said be quiet.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

<i>Now take off your shorts.</i>

Taking shorts oh'.

There we go.

Naked, naked, naked.

<i>Wonderful. Now I'll
take off my clothes</i>

Cool.

Uh-oh.

<i>Here I am, baby.</i>

<i>You miss these?</i>

<i>- Damn it.
- Oh, Leonard. Already?</i>

No, no, no.

The screen froze. It's
probably just buffering.

- Just give it a second?
- Fine.

So how are your mom and dad?

<i>I really don't want to
talk about my parents.</i>

Yeah. Sure, sure.

SHELDON: If your video's frozen,
try resetting the TCP/IP stack.

Oh.

- I didn't even think of that. Thanks.
SHELDON: You're welcome.

Let me know when you are done hogging
the bandwidth for self-abuse.

I'm trying to stream a
movie on Netflix in here.

Five, six, seven, eight.

<i>[SINGING]: Tall and tan
and young and lovely</i>

<i>The girl from ipanema goes walking</i>

<i>And when she passes Each
one she passes goes</i>

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

SHELDON:
Amy. Amy. Amy.

Oh.

Your ritualistic knocking
behavior is symptomatic...

- ...of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
- Ls not.

Is not. ls not.

Denial. Denial. Denial. Come in.

Thank you.

Would you like to hear me
play a bossa nova standard?

No.

How about the theme song to the
television show Diff'renz' Strokes?

<i>[SINGING]: Now the world
don't move to the</i>

SHELDON:
No.

Well, that's every song I know.
What's up?

You're good friends with Penny, right?

Best friends, besties.
BFFs, peas-in-a-pod...

...sisters who would share
traveling pants. Go on.

I was hoping she might listen to you...

...about the dangers of
owning unhygienic furniture.

For general educational purposes...

...or has she acquired a bar
stool dipped in cholera?

Cholera is water-borne.
You're mocking me.

Yes, I am.

Penny has dragged a chair in off the
street whose unknown provenance...

...jeopardizes the health and welfare
of every resident in our building.

Just because you have a focus on
cleanliness bordering on the psychotic...

...doesn't mean I have to participate.

All right. Name your price.

Kiss me where I've never
been kissed before.

You mean like Salt Lake City?

Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.

Thank you.

Will you listen to me
play my harp now?

No. I dislike the sound of the harp.

Its overuse in classic
television sitcoms...

...always makes me think I'm going to
experience an episode from my past.

I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me.
Don't do that.

I don't know about this, Howard.

What? You're having trouble with
the long-distance love-making.

This is your answer.

There are two interfaces
that simulate a human mouth.

You have one, Priya has one in India.
When you move your lips and tongue...

...it transmits exactly
what you're doing to hers.

See? Internet kissing.

Give it a try.

I don't think so.

<i>I'll try it.</i>

Like this?

Almost.

Really get your tongue in there
to activate the motion sensor.

Like this?

- Close. Really French it.
- All right.

- Better?
- Yeah, you got it, you got it.

I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

Whoa, you just bit my tongue.

Oh, I nibbled. I was being playful.

Why do you have to
make everything weird?

Sorry.

- Better?
- Oh, yeah.

Pretty cool, huh? Probably would have
cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

I do appreciate a bargain.

This entire ensemble once
belonged to my dead grandmother.

- You're kidding?
- Everything except bra and panties.

They're a leopard-spotted
secret I share with Victoria.

And now me, heh.

I just have one question
about the chair.

And what's that?

Aren't you worried about
it being unhygienic?

No. It's completely fi...

<i>Hmm.</i>

I get it. Sheldon sent you.
He put you up to this.

- No, he didn't.
- Really?

Yes, he did, he absolutely did.

Oh, my God, Amy, that's
really crappy of you.

- It is?
- Yeah.

Letting Sheldon use you
to manipulate me'?

I thought you were my friend.

No, I am your friend.
Please don't be mad at me.

I can't even believe this.
Maybe you should just go.

No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I take it all back.

Look, I'm, uh... I'm sitting in your
chair, there's nothing wrong with it.

Please let me continue to
be part of your world.

Ow.

What's wrong?

Something in the chair is biting my tushy.
It's not importa... Ow.

Wait, wait, get up. Get up.

[BOTH SCREAMING]

Swear you won't tell Sheldon!

I swear!

Can I tell my doctor?
I'm gonna need shots!

PENNY:
Yeah, sure!

Oh, hey, babe. I think I've
figured this thing out.

<i>- Oh, Leonard, listen...
- No, you listen.</i>

You're my woman and I'm gonna make you
feel things you've never felt before.

- Leonard...
- That's right, say my name.

And beg me for more because
I'm gonna give it to you.

<i>My parents are here.</i>

<i>Hello, Leonard</i>

<i>...if I may also say your name.</i>

- Check it out. Free chair.
- Yeah.

You know, if this was in Sheldon
and Leonard's apartment...

...I wouldn't wind up sitting
on the floor all the time.

On three.

[CHUCKLES]

- Three.
- Three.

What kind of idiot throws away
a terrific chair like this?

[English - US - SDH]

- Who wants the last dumpling?
- Ooh, me.

Penny, a moment.

We just had Thai food.

In that culture, the last morsel
is called the krengjai piece.

And it is reserved for the most important
and valued member of the group.

Thank you all for this high honor.

I've seen pictures of your mother.
Keep eating.

All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

[RAJESH CLEARS THROAT]

This may be hard for you to hear...

...but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancÃ©e.

[INAUDIBLE]

Yeah, well, now it means her.

It's okay if he wants to come.

Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

- I gotta to work. I'll walk down with you.
- Wait.

Uh, which is closer to the
new train store in Monrovia?

The movie theater or The
Cheesecake Factory?

Neither of them are close.

I guess it doesn't matter
which one of you drives me.

Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me.

All right. This four-letter word describes
either a printer's type size...

...or a compulsion to eat dirt.

- Okay, I'm not driving him.
- Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

Aren't you going with Sheldon?

No, I have no interest in model
trains, stores that sell them...

...nor their heart-breaking clientele.

Oh, well, I have some work to do,
so...

I can't imagine that would disturb me.
Carry on.

Okay. Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

Not really, no.

Alrighty then. I guess
I'll just get started.

Please, I don't need the
running commentary.

[SIGHS]

- Amy?
- Yo.

- You okay?
- Oh, sure.

- I thought you were reading.
- I was.

Now I'm thinking about what I read.

You all right, Leonard? You
seem very uncomfortable.

L... I'm fine.

Should I go?

I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

What...? Who told you that?

Well, most recently, my gynecologist.

Oh, you stay as long as you'd like.

I'm glad to hear you say that because
I'm having a wonderful time.

Hmm. I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

What are you gonna get at
the train store, Sheldon?

Oh, I'm not buying anything.

They're having a lecture.

"HO gage railroading.

Half the size of O gage,
but twice the fun."

It's a very controversial topic.

- Which side do you come down on?
- I'll let you know after tonight.

Unlike some people, I'm
going in with an open mind.

Who am I kidding?

Of course we all know
it's O gage or no gage.

Can you believe grown men sit around
and play with toy trains? Heh.

That's big talk...

...for a man with a closet full of
magic tricks at his mother's house.

First of all, they're not tricks.
They're illusions.

Secondly, when we get married,
they're all going up in the attic...

...so you can have that
closet for clothes.

Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

Well, don't think of it that way.

Once we move in, it'll be our house.

Is she moving out?

Why would she move out?
It's her house.

Hang on. You seriously think I'm
gonna live with your mother?

Howard, I think I can help here.

Yes, Bernadette, that's
exactly what he thinks.

Why not? It's a great
house, plenty of room.

If we have kids, Mom's there to help.
When she tells "The Three Little Pigs"...

...she actually has hair
on her chinny chin chin.

[CHUCKLES]

I'm not gonna live with your mother.
Not now, not ever.

Wow, someone obviously
has some mommy issues.

Raj, take me home.

Don't listen to her. Go
to the movie theater.

- Take me home now.
- Movie theater.

[G ROANS]

Okay, everybody, calm down. There
is a simple solution here.

Raj, take me to the train store...

...and then I don't care
what you people do.

How was your shower?

Good, good.

Just out of curiosity, what
time do you usually go to bed?

Oh, I'm up all night.
I'm like a possum.

Boy, you were not liked
in high school, were you?

- Not really. Is that my yearbook?
- Mm-hm.

"Dear Leonard, you're
really good at science.

Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

It wasn't spray-painting a
lightning bolt on my briefcase.

- I can tell you that.
- If it makes you feel any better...

...the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

Aw.

"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are
better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."

[DOOR OPENS]

Well, you can add Jerry's Junction
to the list of train stores...

...Sheldon Cooper will
never set foot in again.

- Rough night, Casey Jones?
- You don't know the half of it.

It was billed as a lively give-and-take
on the merits of model-train sizes.

But it was actually a set-up...

...to intimidate weak-minded, spineless
rubes into buying HO starter sets.

- What's in the bag?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

But it's not a spine, I'll tell you that.

I had a delightful evening. We
should do this again sometime.

Uh, sure. That'd be nice.

Glad to hear it. I need someone
to accompany me to the wedding...

...of Dr. Moranelli and
Dr. Gustufson this Friday.

They're kind of the Brad and Angelina
of the Primatology Department.

- Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?
- I would...

...but the last wedding we
went to was a disaster.

- He behaved like a child the entire time.
- It's not my fault.

You said there'd be other
scientists there my age.

Doesn't matter. You're out. He's in.

No date to the prom, two
dates to a wedding.

Hmm, how times change.

Ha, ha, you have to go to a wedding.

[RINGS]

HOWARD:
I'll get it.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Could you get it?
HOWARD: I said I'm getting it!

MRS. WOLOWITZI Fine, I'll get it.
HOWARD: I got it!

Oh, hi.

H93'...

I don't wanna fight.

I was just surprised when you sprung
the living-with-your-mom stuff on me.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry I
didn't run it by you first.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I don't know who
you're talking to, but in or out!

We don't need bugs!

The bugs only come here...

...because you're their queen!

Listen, how about this?

Before we make any decision about
where we live, we have a trial run.

You know, stay here for a
weekend, see what it's like.

- Your mom would be okay with that?
- Sure, she would.

Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hey, if she's willing
to give the milk away for free...

...who am I to say no?

See? She's good with it.

[CHUCKLES]

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Frankly, after all your
sleepovers with the little brown boy...

...a girl is a big relief.

All these years, I've been so wrong.

The tinier the train, the
more concentrated the fun.

You're a brain scientist.

Can you explain why a brilliant man
likes playing with toy trains?

Not without cutting his head open, no.

How about making my eyes
like Cleopatra?

Really? For a wedding?

You're right. My cheek bones
and beckoning pelvis...

...already have a certain
"Hello, sailor" quality.

I'm ready.

PENNY:
Aw.

So handsome.

Like James Bond.

Better than James Bond
because he's tinier.

I got you this to give to me.

Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally
wear corsages to a wedding.

That's more of a prom thing.

I never went to my prom.

My mom paid my cousin to take me but
he just used the money to buy drugs.

Put the corsage on her.

Amy, this is for you, heh.

When you're done copping a
feel, that goes on my wrist.

All aboard. Woo-woo!

It's official. I'm an HO trainiac.

So dinner went nice.

Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

Does your mother always
out your meat for you?

Only when it's fatty.

Well, don't be jealous, babe.

Someday, you'll get to cut it for me.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Bernadette, I found
the extra head for the Water Pik...

...if you wanna use it.

I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: You sure? I just squirted
half a brisket out of my teeth.

Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Oh, I know what that means.
Hubba-hubba.

- Oh, God.
- Relax, it'll be fine.

BERNADETTE: Okay.
HOWARD: Heh.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Let me know
when you're done canoodling.

Mommy needs a foot rub.

<i>Do a little dance</i>

<i>Make a little love</i>

<i>Get down tonight</i>

<i>Do a little dance</i>

<i>Make a little love</i>

<i>Get down tonight</i>

Would you like to dance?

No, thank you. I'm really
not much of a dancer.

You're not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist, either.

I'm sorry.
The bride and groom seem happy.

Why shouldn't they be? They
have a feverish night...

...of socially-approved
copulation ahead of them.

In some cultures, we'd stand
outside their room...

...cheering as they achieved orgasm.

That sounds like a late night, and
I have work in the morning, so...

Leonard, you may not have noticed,
but I am being a delight here.

You're not holding up
your end of the evening.

I'm sorry.
This wedding just reminds me...

...of my kind-of-sort-of
girlfriend 9000 miles away.

I have a kind-of-sort-of boyfriend
playing with a model train right now.

You don't hear me bitching about it.

A word of advice. Moody
self-obsession is only attractive...

...in men who can play guitar and
are considerably taller than you.

I'm not moody, I'm fun.

Do you have any evidence
to support that statement?

Well, hey, I'm just as
much fun as you are.

Really? Are you willing
to draw a mustache...

...on your finger as a
conversational icebreaker?

I am.

Okay, fine. What do you suggest?

We just had a lovely meal.

The band is on fire.

And you're sitting next to a beautiful
woman wearing whorish makeup.

Why don't we head out on the floor...

...and see if I can sweat
through these dress shields?

Once again, I'm really
not much of a dancer.

Don't worry, I'll lead.

[BAND PLAYING "CHICKEN DANCE"]

[MIMICKING LIGHTSABER BUZZING]

Howard?

[MIMICS LIGHTSABER
POWERING DOWN]

- Ready for bed?
- No. I need to brush my teeth...

...but your mother's been in
the bathroom for an hour.

Oh, yeah, she sometimes has
problems doing her business.

Hang on, ahem.

Ma, give up!

Tonight's not your night!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: You don't
know that, I just sat down!

HOWARD:
Come on, take a break.

Bernadette needs to brush her teeth.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: She can come in and brush her teeth.
I'm not embarrassed.

Problem solved.

[CHUCKLES]

No, it's not. I'm not going in there.

Oh, come on, honey. She's just
sitting in there reading a magazine.

You can't see anything.
I go in all the time.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Ha! The eagle has landed.

[TOILET FLUSHES]

And we have splash down.

[HOWARD CLEARS TH ROAT]

Wait here.
I'm gonna go light a candle.

And then we make passionate love.

[LEONARD GRUNTING]

- There we go, last ï¬oor.
- I just can't figure out what happened.

I put my left leg in, I
took my left leg out.

I put my left leg in, and
something just snapped.

The Hokey-Pokey
is a young man's game.

[CHUCKLES]

I did have a great time.

Thank you for reminding me it's
okay to have fun once in a while.

You're welcome.

Also for breaking the
head off the ice swan...

...so I could hold it
against my pulled groin.

I excel at spatial reasoning,
and I had a hunch...

...that the graceful slope of its neck
would cradle your genitals nicely.

Well, okay. Again, thank you.

And again, you're welcome.

- Wanna come in, have a cup of tea?
- No, I'm gonna head home.

Okay, well, good night.

Good night.

Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

Come in, let's talk.

Do you want a glass of wine?

Wine is one of the
reasons I'm in this fix.

That and this dang pelvis.

Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

The inevitable. He was lonely and
vulnerable from missing his girlfriend.

While I was charming, supportive,
and let's face it...

...in this dress, the perfect
combination of Madonna and whore.

- Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
- No, but it's only a matter of time.

How could I have not seen this coming?

Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

I'm sure he'll be okay.

Oh, Penny. Much as I would
treasure knowing...

...the two of us had been
defiled by the same man...

...Leonard just doesn't
get my motor running.

So, um, what are you gonna do? Do
you want me to talk to Leonard?

- Let him down easy.
- No. I'll let him have tonight.

I'll send him an e-mail...

...letting him know this body is
never gonna be his wonderland.

I mean, frankly, you've got
a better shot than he does.

Leonard, check it out.

I bought an N gage locomotive.

Half the size of HO.

Look, it fits in my mouth.

Sounds like you had a great night.

I did.

- How was yours?
- Not bad.

I had a lot more fun with
Amy than I thought I would.

- What do you mean by that?
- It turns out she really knows...

...how to help a guy loosen
up and have a good time.

Although, truth be told, my
groin's a little worse for wear.

Qw!

- Why'd you do that?
- To send a message.

She is not for you.

- What?
- Not for you.

Good morning, handsome.

Morning, Mom.

It's me.

Yes, it is. And you're so
pretty in the morning.

Your mom and I made you breakfast.

Oh, wow, heh, so you
guys are getting along?

Yeah, I guess.

We're very different people, Howard,
so communication's a little tricky.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Does he like the pancakes?

He didn't try them yet!

- Is there any butter? Heh.
- It's butter-flavored syrup.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
So? What's the word?

He wants butter!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
It's butter-flavored syrup!

I just told him that!

I don't need any butter.

If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.

[English - US - SDH]

SHELDON: The entrance to the
dungeon is a moss-covered door.

You manage to open it only to
find yourself face-to-face...

...with a hideous, foul-smelling,
moss-covered ogre.

What do you do?

I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

Seventeen.

The ogre is amused by yourjoke
and allows you to pass.

By the by, I liked it too.

How go the wedding plans, Howard?

Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.

I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.

See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.

I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

Like playing nerd games with us...

...and then taking a
suspiciously long shower?

Maybe.

We enter the dungeon.

You see a dragon.

Really? So we're playing
Dungeons and Dragons.

And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

- Isn't that a little on the nose?
- When you play Chutes and Ladders...

...do you complain about all
the chutes and the ladders?

Are you gonna eat that whole pie?

Maybe. Why not?

Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

Oh, God, did you watch
Bridget Jones again?

No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married...

- ...you're dating my sister.
- Now that Howard's getting married...

...maybe he'll inflate one of his
old girlfriends for you, heh.

You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

The United States of America.

Your movies and your TV shows...

...promised streets paved with beautiful
blonde women with big bazongas.

Eat another pie, you'll
have your own bazongas.

That's cruel. You know it
goes straight to my hips.

Gentlemen, please focus.

- You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.
- Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.

Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...

...not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.

Now, I assume we use this
same wax later on...

...to neaten up each
other's bikini regions.

Yeah, my bikini region is fine.

Who's shocked? I'm not.

[GIGGLES]

So, Bernadette, how's the
wedding planning going?

And I'm not asking as a
prospective bridesmaid.

[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Pick me. Pick me.

We went cake tasting yesterday.

Raj came along.

He cried and ate half the samples.

Oh, poor guy. He's so lonely. We
should set him up with someone.

You know, I met a really
cute girl at work.

She's married to a guy in
one of our drug trials.

Well, hello? She's married, heh.

Yeah, but her husband is in serious
congestive heart failure...

...and a little birdie told
me he's in the placebo group.

Okay, so future grief-stricken
widow is the one to beat.

- You ready to order?
- One moment.

I'm conducting an experiment.

With Dungeons and Dragons dice?

Yes. From here on in...

...I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.

Thus freeing up my mind to
do what it does best...

...enlighten and amaze.

Page 14, item seven.

So, what's for dinner?

A side of corn succotash.

Hmm, interesting.

Um, Howard, can I see you
for a minute, please?

Ugh, I don't wanna show any more of your
friends how I can fit in the booster seats.

Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please?

Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.

A pitcher of margaritas.

Do you really want that?

That's the great thing.
It doesn't matter.

My mind is freed up to think
about more important things.

What's it thinking about now?

Hamburgers and lemonade.

Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

This is my friend, Emily. I
know her from spin class.

No. Raj, relax. She can't hear you.
She's deaf.

Emily, this is our friend Raj.

- Heh.
- Aw.

Look at you guys, just hitting it oh'.
I am so good.

Hi.

She says, "it's nice to meet you."

Did she really mean that or was
she signing it sarcastically?

Raj says, "it's nice to meet you too." Heh.

Uh, she says she has to
go back to her family.

But Penny has her number if you
wanna text her and get together.

Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.

Tell her, "Maybe. Whatever, babe."

He'll text you, heh.

Huh. Look at that. I have a date.

I love America again.

And now for dessert.

Come on, hot fudge sundae.
Come on, hot fudge sundae.

Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

Okay. As soon as she gets here,
so she knows I'm cool with it...

...I'm going to make a
joke about her being deaf.

[G ROANS]

I was thinking, "Hey, did
you hear the one about...?

Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

Maybe we should revisit your
lonely, fat guy plan, heh.

Oh, she's here.

No joke.

- She's sorry she's late.
- Oh, tell her it doesn't matter.

Tell her her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies...

...in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

Really? That's the first
thing you wanna say?

- I worked on it all night. Use it.
- I don't know the sign for "opalescent."

- Then spell it.
- I don't know how to spell it.

You're blowing this for me.

He likes your eyes, heh.

You're making me sound
like a caveman.

"Thank you, you have nice eyes too."

Really? Ask her how many
children she wants...

...and whatever number
she says, say, "Me too."

No.

Fine. Tell her I have a deep,
sexy voice like James Earl Jones.

She doesn't know what James
Earl Jones sounds like.

Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.

Let's see, what else can I tell you
about me that would make you like me?

Uh...

Oh, I love music.

Do you love music?

You really wanna ask her that?

Oh. You're right. Heh,
everyone loves music.

She says,
"Do you play an instrument?"

No, but when I was 6 years old...

...I tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

But I couldn't get any
other boys to join...

...so my parents asked the
servants to be my backup dancers.

Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.

Sign it in a way that I sound
humble, with just a hint of:

That's right, I had servants

- Do you hear yourself?
- Yes, but she doesn't.

So get signing, hand monkey.

I think I wrote a letter
to Santa Claus every day.

And then on Christmas morning...

...under the tree is a little
puppy with a red ribbon.

[RAJ CHUCKLES]

- What are you doing?
- Texting Bernadette I'm gonna be late.

- Dude, what is she saying?
- It's a funny story about a puppy.

Just smile and laugh.

[LAUGHS]

- Quick, stop smiling.
- What? Why?

The puppy died. It choked on a doll head.
Sad face, sad face.

It's a little hard to see
with the city lights...

...but that W-shaped
constellation is Cassiopeia.

And she was the mother of
Andromeda, who's over there.

Look, pretty stars.

This is her car, heh.

She hopes she can see you again
sometime.

Good, good. Uh...

Oh, boy, uh, help me out here. Does
she want me to kiss her or not?

I speak sign language,
I don't read minds.

- If you were me, would you kiss her?
- Yeah, but I'm the make-out king.

I was so smooth on that date.

[ENGINE STARTS]

You? I made you smooth.
You were an idiot.

Whatever, dude. She kissed me.

Yeah, well, it might have been
on your lips but it was my kiss.

Fine. Let's agree she kissed
both of us.

Okay.

Mustache is looking good there,
Sheldon.

Don't thank me. Thank the dice.

They told me what percentage
of my face to shave.

Why are you still doing this?

Because it's working.

In the past few weeks, unburdened
by trivial decisions...

...I've co-authored two papers in
notable peer-reviewed journals...

...and I'm close to figuring out
why the Large Hadron Collider...

...has yet to isolate the
Higgs boson particle.

You left out, got chafed testicles
because you no longer wear underpants.

The dice giveth
and the dice taketh away.

- Is Raj outwith Emily again?
- Yeah. Every night for the last month.

Wow. I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

Me neither.

Here's some other fun news
on the Raj-Emily front.

He gave her a pair of diamond
earrings and leased her a car.

You're kidding.

- Think she's taking advantage of him?
- Oh, of course not.

She wouldn't do something like that.
She's deaf.

Deaf women can't be gold diggers?

Handicapped people are nice, Leonard.
Everyone knows that.

I actually have information about Raj that
would be helpful with this discussion.

Could you tell us?

Let's see.

Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

Wait. Hang on. Doubles. Roll again.

Okay, get this.

It doesn't matter if he's
showering her with gifts...

...because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

- What do you mean "vastly wealthy"?
- Well, "wealthy" means a lot of money.

"Vastly" means even more. I'm not
sure what's tripping you up.

I know they have money. I
don't think it's that much.

No, you're wrong. As you
know, a few years ago...

...I achieved one of my lesser
dreams and became a notary public.

Well, from time to time, I notarize
banking documents for Raj.

The Koothrappalis aren't just
rich, they're Richie Rich rich.

Well, so how much is that?

About halfway between Bruce
Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.

The last time we went to the zoo...

...that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude but
I need to go call Raj's sister...

...who I love so much.

Ahem, so vastly much.

Okay, so he's got money, and
it's a few gifts, and a car.

And she got him to pay off
all her credit cards.

What? He paid off her credit cards?

Damn it, I could have dated
Raj for a couple months.

But I wouldn't have because I'm not that kind of girl.
We should really talk to Raj.

He's not gonna listen, he's in love.

Can't figure out what to do?
I remember those days.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to...

...stay right here.

[DANCE MUSIC
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

- This is a bad idea. We should go.
- No.

I'm the one that introduced him to her.
I've gotta say something.

Wow.

- You're engaged to my friend.
- Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind...

...where I get my motor running, as
long as I park in the right garage.

I can't believe you're
engaged to my friend.

[WHISPERS] Oh, here she comes.

Smart. Whisper, so the
deaf chick can't hear you.

- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hi.
- Oh, hey. Hi. Nice to see you.

Um, can we talk to you about Raj?

She says, "Sure, what about him?"

Okay. Um, gosh, how do I start?

Um, see, Raj is kind of naive.

He hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.

And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to...

...you might be taking advantage
of him.

By letting him buy you a
bunch of expensive things.

L... Howard, focus.

- Tell her what I'm saying.
- Right.

Are you a gold digger or not?

Oh, something, something. Who the
something do you think you are?

Mind your own something business
and go something yourself.

Oh, ha, ha, wait, I got this now.

- I'm so mad at you.
- Okay, wait.

How dare you ambush my
girlfriend at the gym?

We didn't mean for it
to be an ambush.

It's kind of impossible not
to sneak up on deaf people.

And, hey,
since when are you so chatty?

- I'm hammered.
- Raj, come here.

This girl is trouble.

What kind of relationship is it where you
buy her gifts and she gives you sex?

The best one I've ever had.

Okay, come on,
you know you can do better.

Aha!

I see what's going on here.

You and I had our crazy night
together.

And now you can't stand to
see me with another woman.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

It's okay, I can't get
mad at your feelings.

I don't have feelings.

Yeah, that's good. Keep
telling yourself that.

[DOOR CLOSES]

He is cuter now that I know he's rich.

I have a surprise for you.
Cover your eyes.

Open them.

It's a real ruby.

It was a little expensive, but
no one can put a price on love.

Although the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.

[COMPUTER BEEPING]

Oh, Mummy, Daddy,
what a nice surprise.

<i>No, it's not a nice surprise,
it's a bad surprise.</i>

<i>- Penn y called us
- Penny?</i>

<i>She told us you're spending all
our money on your new girlfriend.</i>

I just got her a couple of things.

She gives me things too.

<i>Yeah, yeah. I'm a gynecologist. I
know exactly what she gives you.</i>

<i>You need to find a nice Indian
girl from a good family.</i>

<i>If you keep seeing this
woman, you're cutoff.</i>

What? You're gonna make me choose
between the woman I love...

...and the money I have
very strong feelings for?

<i>It's up to you.</i>

- Well, I choose love.
- Heh, you're an <i>idiot.</i>

<i>Love doesn't last.</i>

<i>Well, he's going to
find out eventually.</i>

<i>Think about it.</i>

My, uh, parents are making me
choose between money and you.

I choose you.

No. I think we'll have to return
the car.

And the necklace. Yeah, that too.

But none of those things matter
because we have something better.

We have love.

- Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
_Uh_

I know. I know.

Sometimes I put the TV on mute just
to pretend she's still with me.

But I can't watch the
closed-captioning without crying.

[SOBBING]

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I wish I can make you feel better.

Seriously?

I'm heartbroken
and you're hitting on me?

What? No.

Look, Penny, you're great, but I
had a long talk with my parents.

And they said if I date an
Indian girl, I get a Maserati.

Mm, oh, cheesecake, you're
just as good as a woman...

...even though I can't have sex
with you.

Try throwing it in the
microwave for a few seconds.

Should I use the restroom
or wait until we get home?

Come on,
Papa needs to void his bladder.

Oh, that's not what you wanna
see after three buttermilks.

Here you go, boys. I'll pick
it up when you're ready.

- Thanks for dinner, buddy.
- Yeah, real big of you.

Hurry, hurry, hurry.

Oh, don't cheap out on the tip.
We all know you're loaded now.

[English - US - SDH]

<i>It's from Game of Thrones.</i>

- What do you think?
- I don't know.

If we're going to start a
fantasy sword collection...

And I've long thought we should.

...Is this really the sword to start with?

What did you have in mind?

Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

It gives you the right to rule England.

It would be a replica of a movie prop.

Fair enough.

It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.

Well, they don't have an Excalibur
here, so, what do you want to do?

Ugh, tough decision.

<i>There's no weaponry from
Lord of the Rings...</i>

...forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.

Two grown men with a hobbit's
dagger, wouldn't we look silly?

- Okay, let's go for it.
LEONARD: Heh.

Oh, I see you guys have
found my little treasure.

Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.

Okay? It's magnificent.

Buh-buh-buh-buh.

What do you want for it?

Oh, it's hard to put a
price on something...

...that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

But for my friends, let's say 250.

- Ooh, that's pretty steep.
- It's a limited edition.

They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.

Only 8000. We're wasting
precious time. Buy it.

Hang on. Can you do any better?

I'm already giving you the
friends and family discount.

Oh, did you hear that? The
friends and family discount.

We are honored and we will take it.

Slow down. Two hundred.

What are you doing? 250 is
already a discounted price.

- Will you shut up?
- Tell you what, I'll go 235.

Nope. Maybe another time.

- Okay, 225, my final offer.
- Take it, take it.

- Two hundred.
- Man, you're killing me.

Killing you? I can't breathe.

Two ten and I'm losing money.

Oh, no, we can't let him lose
money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.

Two ten and you throw
in the Iron Man helmet.

Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.

So?

If you're gonna question the
importance of a signature...

...on a plastic helmet from a
movie based on a comic book...

...then all of our lives
have no meaning.

- Okay, fine. Just the sword, 210.
- Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

See that? I just saved us 40 bucks.

I've long said that what you
lack in academic knowledge...

...you make up for in street smarts.

- You want me to wrap it?
- No, it's okay.

I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

- Hey, Stuart.
- Ah, hey, Wil.

Hello, Wil Wheaton.

- Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
- It's part of my sword collection.

- Do you have a sword collection?
- No.

Heh, I'm not surprised.

Here's the Batman six twelve...

...with the Jim Lee alternate
cover that you wanted.

- Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
- Forty bucks.

- Good deal.
- Sucker.

He didn't even ask for the
friends and family discount.

I'm having a party on Friday and
I was hoping you would stop by.

- Will there be girls there?
- Of course.

Because there wasn't last time.

There will be girls.

You guys are invited if
you want to come by.

- Thank you.
- All right, great. Later.

I see what you're doing.

You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.

He tells everyone
we're going to be there.

And when we don't show, he looks the fool.
Fiendishly clever.

I was actually thinking about going.

And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...

...leaving him humiliated in
front of his guests. Love it.

No, I was gonna grab Raj and
Howard and have a good time.

Ah, great, more guys.

It's gonna be another Wil
Wheaton sausage-fest.

- Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
- Possibly.

- Can you or can't you?
- It's not that simple, Leonard.

It never is, is it?

At this moment,
our relationship exists...

...in two mutually contradictory states.

Until you either do not go or
go to Wil Wheaton's party...

...you are simultaneously my
friend and not my friend.

I'm characterizing this phenomenon
as Schr6dinger's friendship.

- Got it. Can I have my water?
- Yeah, of course.

Now get it yourself, you traitor.

- Wait, what is going on?
- In case you have forgotten...

-...Schr6dinger's cat is a thought...
- No, I didn't forget.

Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...

...it's either dead or alive or both.

Although our cat got stuck in
my brother's camp trunk...

...and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

Homespun stories, knowledge of
physics and a bosom that defies it.

You're the whole package,
aren't you?

Sorry I'm late. Ugh, I got great news.

NASA picked my team's design for
the deep field space telescope...

...that's going on the International
Space Station this spring.

SHELDON: Oh, WOO, heh.
AMY: WOW, heh.

- Howie, that's wonderful! Congratulations!
HOWARD: Uh, heh.

It gets better. Someone has to
go up with the telescope...

...as a payload specialist, and
guess who that someone is, heh.

Muhammad Li.

Who's Muhammad Li?

Muhammad is the most common
first name in the world...

...Li, the most common surname.

As I didn't know the answer, I thought
that gave me a mathematical edge.

It's me, Sheldon. It's me.
I'm going up in space!

Technically, I'm an astronaut.

PENNY: Oh, my God.
LEONARD: That's amazing.

- Heh.
- Hang on a second.

NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

- How are you gonna get up there?
- Oh, uh, it's cool.

You fly to Moscow, they
take you to Kazakhstan.

Then you get in a Russian Soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

Or it just sits on the launch pad because
the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel...

...on the black market, heh.

Are those Russian rockets safe?

Safe as it can be...

...when it was built by the folks
who brought you Chernobyl. Ha, ha.

I'd like to propose a toast.

The dream to go up into space
is one we all share...

...and Howard's making that a reality.
We're all very proud of you.

ALL:
Cheers.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

- That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
- Thank you.

Simultaneously, a festival of
cloying clichÃ©s. You sicken me.

You're really quiet. ls everything okay?

Fine.

Just a little tired.

I hope not too tired because I'm feeling
particularly masculine right now.

All systems go, if you
catch my drift. Heh.

I always catch your drift.

Well, something's obviously
bugging you.

What is it?

I can't believe you signed up for the
space program without talking to me.

[SIGHS]

I get it. We...
You're worried about me.

That is so sweet. You know,
there's a saying we have at NASA.

What makes the right stuff so right
is that it always comes home.

Just stop talking, Howard.

This isn't the reaction I expected...

...when I told you I was
gonna be an astronaut.

What did you think was gonna happen?

Honestly? Sex, heh.

- Howard.
- Do you realize what a big deal this is?

What an honor it is to be
chosen to go into space?

Yeah, I get it. I just wish you
included me in the decision.

We're supposed to be partners.
We're supposed to be a team.

[HOWARD SIGHS]

I'm sorry. You're right.

Uh, okay, let's try this again.

Bernadette,
an opportunity has come up...

...that impacts both of us
and I'd like to discuss it.

- Okay.
- Heh, I've been offered a chance...

...to go up to the International
Space Station for three weeks.

What are your thoughts on that?

Well, first of all...

...thank you for including me
in the decision making process.

Hey, we're a team. Heh.

- So, what do you think?
- No.

- No?
- No.

Wh...?

Whoa, why not?

Howard, ugh, my father
was a police officer.

We never knew from one
night to the next...

...if he was gonna come home alive.
It was horrible.

And I don't want to
live that way with you.

[SIGHS]

Well, hey...

...my father abandoned me and
my mother when I was 11.

We never saw him again.

Oh, boo hoo, you're not going to space.

- Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
- Don't talk to me...

...as if nothing's happened between us.
And yes, it sure is, buddy.

Will you stop
with the Schrijdinger stuff?

Would you prefer an application of
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

In which I could either
know where you are...

...or whether I like you, but not both?

You never stop talking, do you?

What difference does it make if
Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?

No, Wil Wheaton
is Sheldon's mortal enemy.

- Mortal enemy?
- Mm-hm.

Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a
left-handed monkey wrench but...

- You really have a mortal enemy?
- In fact, I have 61 of them.

- Would you like to see the list?
- Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

You just got off the list.
Would you like back on it?

This'll just take a moment. It's on
a five and a quarter inch floppy.

- A floppy disk?
- Well, I started the list when I was 9.

How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?

PENNY: Oh, God.
LEONARD: Come on.

As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher...

...Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

So I drove for hours by bus
to a Star Trek convention...

...at which Wil Wheaton was
scheduled to appear...

...so that I could get my Wesley
Crusher action figure signed.

But he never showed...

...because apparently, it
was "cooler" for him...

...to be the lower-left
corner <i>on</i> Hollywood Squares.

Oh, damn! The floppy failed.

Well, whoever was in charge
of quality control...

...at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989,
congratulations, you just made the list.

- Howard?
- Change your mind about sex?

I'm still mad but I'll do it.

No, I've just been thinking.

[HOWARD SIGHS]

It doesn't matter if I'm
afraid for your safety.

I don't want to be the person who
stands between you and your dreams.

- Really?
- Really.

If going into space means that much I
will never say another word about it.

Thank you, heh.

- I love you.
- I love you too, heh.

So sex now?

- Okay.
- Heh.

I just forgot to brush my teeth.
I'll be right back.

[SOUL MUSIC
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Over my dead body,
my son goes into outer space!

I'm ready.

Let me see if I got this right.

You actually asked Bernadette
to leave your house?

What choice did I have? She
went behind my back...

...and turned
my own mother against me.

Wow, you're not
only our first astronaut.

You're also the first one of
us to kick a girl out of bed.

You're like a rock star.

- Little bit, heh.
- I hate to say it...

- ...but she did kind of betray you.
- Interesting.

You see betrayal in
others but not yourself.

Going to Wheaton's party
is not betraying you.

Of course, you would have to believe that.
Evil always thinks it's doing right.

Huh.

Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are
the droids you're looking for.

I'm going to a party.

I'm not turning R2-D2 and
C-3PO over to the Empire!

Not yet.

What's gonna happen? Are you
and Bernadette gonna break up?

If we're going to get back together,
she's gonna have to apologize...

...and accept that I'm a grown man
who can make his own decisions.

Then convince your mother
to let you go into space.

Obviously.

I had no choice.
I had to tell his mother.

He can't go to space.

He's like a baby bird.

Do you know he once got
an asthma attack...

...from reading an old library book?

- You're kidding.
- No, I was there that day.

Sheldon threw his back out
handing him that book.

I don't know what I'm going to do.

I don't want to break up over this.

Why don't you tell him
you made a mistake?

Do you guys think it was a mistake?

Am I the bad guy in this?

It's not for us to judge. We're here
to provide comfort and support...

...while you come to grips with what
a despicable thing you've done.

Oh, God, you're right.

I took our love and threw it
under his bus-sized mother.

- I need to apologize.
- That's good, I'm glad you came to that.

But before you do, let me just
ask you a big picture question.

What?

Are you a hundred percent
positive youloveu.

...and want to marry
Howard Wolowitz?

- I do, with all my heart.
- Tsk, got it. Just had to check.

He's great.

All right, Sheldon.
We're going to Wil's.

- This is your last chance.
- No, Leonard, this is your last chance.

One day, a historian is going
to come to you and say:

"Is it true you were friends
with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?"

And you're going to have to choke back
a hot sob of regret and humiliation...

...as you mumble, "I was, but
I chose to go to a party...

...thrown by the one kid from Stand
<i>By Me</i> that no one remembers."

- You want to drive?
- Sure.

[DOOR CLOSES]

- Hey, Sheldon?
- Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.

No, I just got a text from Stuart.
Brent Spiner is at the party.

- Brent Spiner?
- Yes.

I don't care.

Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself.
You love him.

I did, but I think I've
kind of outgrown Star Trek.

You know, stock characters,
ludicrous plots, beam me up.

What a load of hooey.

I'm going.
Live long and prosper, Sheldon.

Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, Bernadette's here!

Tell her I'm not home!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: What kind of a schmuck play is that?
She can hear you shouting!

- Can we talk'?
- You can. I have nothing to say.

All right.

I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
I said something to your mother.

I was gonna tell her eventually
but you went behind my back.

I know. I'm sorry.

- I got scared.
- If you're gonna love me...

...you're gonna have to
love the whole package.

The tenderhearted poet
and the crazy daredevil.

- I know.
- Don't say it if you're not gonna mean it.

I'm not just gonna stop
with the space station.

Yeah, I want to go to the
moon, I want to go to Mars.

I want to take a one-man sub to
the lowest depths of the ocean.

Really? You got seasick on
Pirates of the Caribbean.

Well, those big kids were rocking it, heh.

I just did what I did because
I love you so much...

...and the thought of losing
you is more than I can handle.

- Really?
- You're my soul mate.

[HOWARD SIGHS]

- This is where you kiss me.
- Right, right, heh.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Make up all you want!
Your tokus is not leaving this planet!

Hey, you know that beautiful actress...

...who plays the Borg
Queen in <i>First</i> Contact?

- Yeah.
- Well, I just met her gynecologist.

- What are you doing here?
- Fighting for our friendship.

As peculiar and annoying as you can
be, you're still my little buddy.

I'm not going to let
that end here tonight.

Now put down that drink, let's
meet Brent Spiner and go home.

Hey, Sheldon,
I'm so glad you made it.

I found something
I think you might like.

What I'd like is for him to
have a more depressing home.

This is quite lovely.

This is for you.

An original mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

I remembered your story about the
time you went to a convention...

...to get one signed and I didn't show.
Look at what I wrote.

"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long.
Your friend, Wil Wheaton."

It's my last one.
I want you to have it.

Look, everyone.
Wil Wheaten is my friend!

Oh, wow. I haven't seen
one of these in years.

Remember how we used to make these
things look like they were masturbating?

Brent Spiner, what have you done?

That was a mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

Signed by my close personal
friend, Wil Wheaton.

Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data
dolls in the trunk of my car.

You want me to sign one for you?

You've already signed
something, Brent Spiner.

Your name on my list.

From this moment on, you
are my mortal enemy.

Don't worry. It doesn't take
up a whole lot of your time.

Come on, buddy. Let's not waste
another second on this loser.

Love your house.

- Can we get autographed dolls?
- Sure.

Twenty bucks.

Ten.

- Eighteen.
- Twelve.

- Sixteen.
- Two for 30.

And you come to my birthday party.

Done.

[English - US - SDH]

So, what kind of cruise is this
you're going on?

It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

Christian Quarterly gave it
their highest rating: five thorny crowns.

I do wish you'd come with me,
Sheldon.

Oh, well, Mom, if I did,
it would be conclusive proof...

...that your God can work miracles.

You're missing out. It's gonna be
wall-to-wall fun. It's all themed.

There's Jonah-and-the-Whale
watching.

All you can eat
Last Supper Buffet.

And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask, heh.

Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

You write your sins
on a clay pigeon...

...they fire them up in the air, and you
pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun...

...full of our Lord's forgiveness.

Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see
how advanced your group has become...

...willing to sail out into the ocean
without fear of falling off the edge.

For example, if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write ''smart mouth'' on his pigeon.

And then: Bam!

The Lord giveth
and the Lord bloweth away.

Well, Mom, according to my itinerary
for our weekend together...

-...the fun begins with fried chicken.
-Sounds delicious.

Good, because I got you everything
you need to make it.

You are in for a treat.

My mother's fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad...

...the extra large coffin.

Sheldon, she just got off the plane.
She doesn't wanna cook.

Of course she does.

Making me food is her way of saying
''I love you.''

Making me food when too tired...

...is her way of saying
''I really love you.''

I wouldn't mind going out
for a bite, Sheldon.

Won't that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you're gonna make?

All right.
We're going out. You like sushi?

There's a great place down the street.

I've never had it, but there's no harm
in trying something new.

There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

That's why we test out drugs
and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

Actually, I had him tested as a child.

Doctor says he's fine.

-Told you.
-I do regret not following up...

...with that specialist in Houston.

[ALL GREETING IN JAPANESE]

Stop yelling.

I'm not happy about this.

What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

The prospect of fried chicken.

This is exciting.

Back home, the diner
on Route 4 serves sushi...

...but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

They put it on the menu in those kung fu
letters, but that don't make it sushi.

Uh, ''Kung fu letters''
might not be politically correct.

Oh, I thought the one
we couldn't say was ''ching chong.''

Yeah, yeah, that too.

So, Shelly, what's up with you
and your friend Amy...

...if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

Well, there's actually big news
on the Amy front.

She's been studying the neurobiology
of addiction in lower animals.

She's this close to getting a starfish
hooked on cocaine.

You have any idea
what's going on with those two?

Hmm. It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

Maybe there's something there,
maybe there isn't. We'll never know.

But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

How are you doing
on the young lady front?

I hear you're in some sort
of a long-distance situation?

Uh. Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

It's kind of tough. She's in India.

Her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

Because you-- You never think about it
going the other way.

Well, you can't force things.

Figure out if you're in a relationship or if
you're just calling it one. Like they say:

''A cat can have kittens in the oven,
but that don't make them biscuits.''

That reminds me of another saying:

''You can lead a chicken to Crisco,
but you can't make your mother fry it.''

You pester me one more time
about chicken...

...I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

Please pester her. Please, for me.

Mrs. Cooper,
what did you think of the sushi?

Good. The only thing that would have
made it better, if it was cooked.

And if it was beef.

Sheldon, when is your landlord
gonna fix the elevator?

SHELDON:
I don't know.

Lately, we've been talking
about converting it into a missile silo.

Your son seems to think we need to
launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

SHELDON:
Get them before they get us.

Hey, look who decided to show up.

Raj, what are you doing?

Well, I couldn't find you guys
so I bought six new friends.

Three, sadly, are dead.

Mom, you remember Rajesh?
Rajesh, my mother.

Of course. Mrs. Cooper.
So nice to see you again.

Well, it's so nice to see you too. Heh.

I thought it was our Indians
that had the occasional alcohol problem.

We don't say that, either.

I'll make you a list.

Oh, that would be
mighty white of you.

So, Raj, what pain
are you trying to cover up...

...with alcohol?

-Nothing, I'm fine.
-Are you?

[WHIMPERING]
No.

That's better.
Now, tell me what's bothering you.

I'm so lonely.

Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.
It's a tragic human condition.

Now, Raj,
if you'll excuse my mother...

...she's about to make a pecan pie
that'll be so good...

...I'll almost forget how she blew it
with the fried chicken.

Sheldon, your friend is hurting.

What do we do
when someone's hurting?

Offer them a hot beverage.

When they're drunk as a skunk,
what beverage do we offer?

Coffee.

And what do we do it with?

Now, you listen to me.

I know you feel
like you can't find someone...

...but there's a lock for every key.

Back home, there's a girl works
at the Walmart. Tall, tall girl.

Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

Thought she'd never find a man,
then one day, wouldn't you know...

...Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

Long story short,
today that woman travels the world...

...with a semiprofessional
basketball player...

...and two beautiful
mixed-race babies.

I didn't get a lot of that
because of your accent...

...but the general tone was soothing
and somehow I feel better. Ha, ha.

I'm not gonna get my pecan pie,
am I?

You want some Oreos?

-Double Stuf?
-No, it's regular.

Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

I'm glad we're finally getting to do
something together, just the two of us.

Sure. One thing you really miss
when you're on vacation is laundry.

Careful,
you're using too much Downy.

You know if my clothes
get too soft it makes me sleepy.

Well, this takes me back. Me doing
your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

It is nice, isn't it?

[GASPS]

Mrs. Cooper.

-Hi.
-Oh, hello, darling.

Sheldon, you didn't tell me
your mom was coming.

It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

Right between
''Beet season is finally here''...

...and ''Uh-oh, red stool from beets
leads to cancer scare.''

-So how have you been?
-Good, good.

Leonard has a new girlfriend.
How are you doing with all that?

Oh, fine. You know, it's, been a while.
I'm getting back out there.

Let me ask you, when you get back
out there, are you wearing this?

Well, it's super cute on.

That top has paid for itself in free drinks,
like, 1 0 times what it cost.

Yes, Penny has a lot of money
tied up in promiscuity futures.

Hon, you think maybe the reason
why you're having trouble...

...finding a guy is because you're letting
them ride the roller coaster...

...without buying a ticket?

Oh, they don't always get to ride
the roller coaster.

Sometimes they only get to spin
the teacups.

I'm going out. Would it be crazy to ask
you to look at the outfit I'm gonna wear?

Oh, not crazy at all.
And don't beat yourself up.

When I was your age,
you could have me for a car ride...

-...and a bottle of strawberry wine.
-Ha, ha.

Yeah, that will not be
in this week's e-mail blast.

So this spring, I get to go
to the International Space Station.

Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

If you ever wanna live there eternally,
I've got a good book you could read.

I watch the Charlie Brown
Christmas Special every year...

...so I get the gist.

I bet your mom is really proud of you.

Nope. She says if I don't back out,
she's gonna go on a hunger strike.

Um, it would take years before she'd be
in any kind of danger, but still.

I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

I'm taking you to see
Saul Perlmutter give a lecture...

...about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

And the best part is,
at the Q and A afterward...

...I've worked up a couple of
Q's that will stump his sorry A.

I don't know, Shelly. I thought we could
do a little sightseeing.

What sight is better than your little boy
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

Come on, we'll take your mom
to see the Hollywood sign...

...the Wax Museum,
the Walk of Fame.

Ooh. Maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

Well, I can't spend $12,000
on a handbag...

...but it's free to look upon those
who do with righteous condemnation.

-What do you say?
-What do I say?

I say you people need to stop ruining
my mom's visit with your sushi...

...and your sadness
and your slutty shirts.

Stop it.

He's not talking about your shirt.
Your shirt is fine.

These are delicious.

The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.
I cook everything in it.

Everything?
Aren't you worried about your health?

Doctors are always changing
their mind.

One week bacon grease
is bad for you.

Next week
we're not getting enough of it.

Good morning, Shelly.

Mom, I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

Apology accepted.

Great. Now, you're gonna love
the Perlmutter lecture.

Look, he will be stating that the universe
is older than 6000 years...

...but you could stick
your fingers in your ears...

...and hum ''Amazing Grace''
during those parts.

I am still going out with your friends.

But I apologized.

And that was hard for me
because I didn't do anything wrong.

Shelly, I hung out with you
in enough dusty lecture halls...

...while you were growing up.
I wanna go sightseeing.

So why don't you have some pancakes,
get dressed and come with us.

I'm not going, and you can't make me.

You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

Well, I'm going to stand here
until you change your mind.

Then you are gonna stand there
all day.

I'm just gonna take my bacon grease
and slide over there.

I can't believe my own mother
is abandoning me.

I am not abandoning you.

Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you
in a basket on a church doorstep.

I am going to Hollywood
and thank a wax Ronald Reagan...

...for his service to our country.

We appear to be at a crossroads
in our relationship, Mother.

-Well, I guess we are.
-Sorry. Syrup.

All right, Mom. When you're at
the Ripley's Believe lt Or Not Museum...

...if they have an exhibit about a mother
who threw away a chance...

...to spend a day with the world's
most wonderful son, believe it, it's true.

I hadn't....

That lecture was a waste of time.

I made more accurate diagrams
of the expansion of the early universe...

...on the nursery wall
with the contents of my diaper.

[COUGHS]

Are you getting sick?

No, I'm just allergic to people who get
Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

Sheldon, is it possible
that your foul mood or...

...to use the clinical term, bitchiness...

...is because your mother
isn't making you a priority?

No. Or to use the clinical term: Nuh-uh.

Are you sure?
The infant-mother pair-bond...

...is the building block
of primate psychology.

Oh, there it is. It always comes back
to monkeys with you.

Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

Sheldon, we're all animals.

There are aspects of you
that are extraordinary...

...but when it comes to relationships,
you're like everybody else.

Are you trying to suggest
that my emotional problems...

...are no different
than those of a stupid person?

Actually, some research indicates
that by not overthinking...

...the less intelligent
handle emotions better.

[SNEEZES THEN GRUNTS]

Sure you're not coming down
with a cold?

Oh, yes, the common cold.
Just like everyone else.

You'd love that, wouldn't you?

Oh, this one's sweet.

You know, for your rosary rattlers.

Mrs. Cooper, we say ''Catholics,''
not ''rosary rattlers.''

My goodness, it's a wonder
you people in California can talk at all.

This is like the worst Hollywood
tour ever.

Now, dude, she wanted to see churches.

Hey, they have wine here, don't they?

Hey, none of our gods
have abs like that.

Yep, that's the last Jew
who did sit-ups.

And look where it got him.

Hey, while we're here,
why don't we all do some praying?

Let's put a little church in this church.

Oh, I'm not sure we should--

It's easy. I'll show you how.

Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you
from Gomorrah, California.

I want to thank you
for the blessing that is my little Shelly.

I also want to thank you
for the continued strength...

...not to coldcock him with my Bible.

All right, Penny, your turn.

Okay, um, ahem. Hey, God. What's up?

Um. I'm good, but it would be a big help
to my family...

...if you could get my brother
to stop cooking meth.

But no cops. Be cool.

She also goes a little overboard
on the ''love thy neighbor.''

Could probably use that chat
you had with Mary Magdalene.

Leonard, you're up.
Wasserman, you're on deck.

Okay. I don't know.

It's probably a little late to ask you
to make me taller.

Oh, um....

If you could help out with my girlfriend.
She's all the way in India.

-That would be great.
-Hear that? Girl trouble.

Turns out we were both wrong
on that front.

-How about you?
-Uh, me? No. Thanks, I'm good.

I'm really just trying not to burst
into flames. Heh.

Rajesh?

Uh, he says he's having trouble
dropping those last five pounds.

Huh. I might have gone
with the talking-to-girls thing.

[CHUCKLES]

No, you only get one wish.

Look at the two of us.

Me, a highly regarded physicist.

The kind of mind that comes along once,
maybe twice in a generation.

You, the common man...

...tired from your labors
as a stockbroker...

...or vacuum cleaner salesman,
or bootblack.

But deep down inside...

...apparently we're
just two peas in a pod.

Uh, a regular pea...

...and the kind of pea that comes along
once, maybe twice in a generation.

[THUNDER CRASHES]

Rain. Another great equalizer.

Falling on the head of the brilliant
and the unremarkable alike.

Smarty-pants.

-Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
-You take notes, darling.

The real way to get a man is with melted
cheese and cream of mushroom soup.

He'll die at 50,
but his love will be true.

Brr.

I need a tissue. This one got wet.

-Here.
-Thank you.

Yeah, I've learned something today.

You and I, in so many ways...

...other than intelligence
and what counts, we're the same.

[SNEEZES]

Sweetheart, are you sick?

I hope so, because if this is well,
life isn't worth living.

Sugar pie, you are burning up.
We've got to get you to bed.

-Okay.
-Don't worry.

Mama's here to take care of her baby.

And just to be clear, only her baby
and not these other people.

Of course.

Can I have tea with honey
and toast with the crust cut off?

-You can have whatever you want.
-Brr. Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,
you didn't have hair on your chest.

I know, it filled in last year.

I didn't get to spend a lot of time
with you on this visit.

And whose fault was that?

[SIGHS]

Yours.

Shelly, you're not 8 years old anymore.
We have to have a different relationship.

No, we don't.

-The one we have works great.
-Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

Or maybe I'm part of a new species
that lives for years...

...which means
I'm still basically a toddler.

Oh, I so should have taken you
to Houston.

Does this mean
you're not going to sing ''Soft Kitty'?

No, I will always sing you
''Soft Kitty.''

[SINGING]
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur

-Were we supposed to take that pie out?
-Get out!

Well, that was rude.

Well, I know, but he means well.

Sing.

[SINGING]
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty--

What are you trying to pull, Mom?

From the top.

This is what I'm talking about.

[SINGING]
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur

[English - US - SDH]

And reverse the spin
on the antiproton...

...and gamma becomes alpha.

Multiplied by a matrix of
negative I comma zero.

And there we have it.

Conclusive proof that I am
absolutely worthless after 9:00.

SPOOKY VOICE:
Sheldon.

Sheldon.

<i>Hmm.</i>

[ENERGY CRACKLING]

All right, all right.

I see what's going on.

A little pre-Halloween hijinkery.

[MOANING]

[WOMAN CACKLING]

[CHAIN RATTLING]

A ghostly moan, a rattling
of chains, a witch's cackle.

Trifecta of haunted house clichÃ©s.

Instead of "Eek," I say, "Yawn."

SPOOKY VOICE:
Sheldon.

Oh, the walls are dripping blood...

...which looks nothing like a
phenolphthalein indicator...

...exposed to a sodium carbonate
solution.

"See you in hell, Sheldon."

The most frightening thing about
that is the missing comma.

[SCREAMS THEN PANTS]

Okay, heh, all right.

That one was clever.

Skeleton with phosphorous
on a zip line.

Come on out, merry pranksters.
Take a bow.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

- You should've seen your face.
- Yes.

There's nothing quite like the slightly
widened eyes of mildly startled.

Come on, admit it. We got you.

Please. Fright depends on
an element of surprise.

The simple fact is, because I
am much smarter than you...

...and able to anticipate your actions...

...it is highly unlikely that you
two rubes could ever surprise me.

- He's probably right.
- We can't beat him. He's just too smart.

Gentlemen.

[SCREAMS]

[ALL LAUGHING]

Okay, who had money on "faints"?

I had "pee his pants."

Hang on.
Looks like everyone's a winner.

[CHUCKLING]

Oh, watch out, Sheldon.

This little boy Casper is a gh...
Gh... Gh... Ghost!

- Ha-ha-ha.
- Droll.

Eh, not as droll as a grown man passed
out in a puddle of his own urine.

[ALL CHUCKLE]

That was pretty droll.
With a hint of ammonia.

Yes, enjoy yourjapes, gentlemen.

Think you've poked fun at
a milquetoast academic.

You've forgotten one thing.

I am also a son of the Lone Star State.
I'm Texas through and through.

And we know how to settle
scores down there.

If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

Hot girl, 9 o'clock.

Don't everybody look at once.

What is she doing
in a comic book store?

I don't know. She might be lost.

Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

- Hi.
- Hi.

That's, um...

it... it... it...

Shut up.

- Are you getting this <i>Next Men?</i>
- Uh, yeah.

It's issue number 21, first
appearance of Hellboy.

I know. I've been looking
for it for years.

- Sorry.
- Hey, if I pretended to hit on you...

...could I distract you
enough to sneak it away?

Yes, but you'd be using
your superpowers for evil.

Damn, I'm forbidden by my
Kryptonian father to do so.

[CHUCKLES]

- I'm Alice.
- Um, Leonard.

You're very cute, Leonard.

Thanks. You too. You know,
go ahead and take it.

No, no, no, I... I did evil.

- Would you be open to a trade?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.

Okay. Here. This is my number.

- Call me.
- Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

What's that word?

- Alice.
- Oh, right, your name.

That makes more sense than "penis."

Later.

Did we just see you pick up a
girl in a comic book store?

Because if you did, you get your picture
up there on the Wall of Heroes.

No, I don't think I picked her up.
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

Doesn't matter. This is the
closest anyone's ever come.

You're going on the wall, my friend.

Be sure to check the mail.

How many times are you gonna tell me?
What's with you?

Nothing. It's not suspicious
that I'm fixating.

It's consistent with my personality.

- Right.
- Hey, guys.

More Halloween candy? Didn't you
just buy a bunch of it yesterday?

Oh, yeah, that's gone.

It's a rough month when Halloween
and PMS hit at the same time.

Leonard doesn't have time to chat.
He has to get the mail.

Oh, will you relax? I'll
get it in a minute.

- Hey, how was work?
- Open the mail.

[LEONARD SIGHS]

Excuse me.

A couple of circulars,
nothing important.

- What's with him?
- Hang on.

[HORN BLARES]

You might be from Texas,
but I'm from New Jersey.

[HORN BLARES]

Check it out. Jim Lee drew this
of me two years ago at Comic-Con.

- What are you wearing?
- Well, you know, it's Comic-Con.

<i>I'm Lion-O from ThunderCaz's.</i>

[LAUGHS]

Wow, you must have gotten so laid.

Heh. No, but Jessica Alba
did rub my furry belly.

[LAUGHS]

Wanna see a comic I draw?

You're kidding.
You have your own book?

- Yeah, it's kind of based on my life.
- Ha, ha. Cool.

Oh, wow, look, there's you having sex...

...with a guy in the top
half of a Chewbacca costume.

- Comic-Con?
- You'd think, but no.

You're very talented. This is really good.
Did you do...?

So can I trade you my
comic for the Hellboy?

You can have my car.

Oh, dear.

Oh, dear.

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.

- Good morning, Sheldon.
- It is, isn't it?

[GASPS]

Oh, bother.

Isn't that just always the way?

You go to staple something
and you're out of staples.

Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier
today when I was at Staples.

You have a thing of paper
clips right there.

No, no, uh, I need something more
permanent to join these papers.

Say, uh, don't you keep staples
in your top desk drawer?

I don't know, maybe.

Be a lamb and check.

All right.

[GASPS]

Who do we have here?

It's a snake. A terrifying snake.

Oh. Did some bad man put us
in a drawer?

Stop talking like that. You've
been rendered speechless by fear.

Let's go to the biology lab and
find you some nice yummy mice.

I tried to scare an Indian with a snake.

Come on, Cooper.
You're better than this.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

It's open.

- Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

- Thanks.
- Want some mac and cheese?

No. Lactose. Gas.

- Glass of wine?
- No. Sulfites. Migraines.

Well, I'd offer you Halloween
candy, but that's gone.

- So, what's up?
- Okay, we used to go out, right?

Oh, my God.
That's where I know you from.

I'm dealing with a situation and
it's kind of about my love life.

So I know that might be weird
for us to talk about...

...but in this area, as you know, all
my other friends are just so stupid.

All right, what's going on?

- So you're okay talking about this?
- Yes.

- Sure it's not weird?
- It's okay.

If you ever wanna talk to me about a
problem in your life with a guy...

...then I... I'd be fine with that.

Okay, good. There's this
one guy I used to date...

...who's about to be force-fed wine and
cheese if he doesn't get to the point.

Okay, uh, here it is.

Is it cheating if a guy
has a girlfriend...?

Yeah, probably.

- Come on.
- I'm sorry, go ahead.

I met this girl and she's great.
We have a lot in common.

- Did you guys do it?
- No. We just made out a little.

Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

- Did you tell her about Priya?
- Uh, I was gonna...

...but there were too
many tongues in my mouth.

That's gross.

Here's the thing. Uh, I... I'm not one
of those guys who sneaks around...

...and sleeps with
more than one woman.

Well, good for you.

The problem is I wanna
be one of those guys.

So sleep with the new
girl and lie to Priya.

Oh, that's not who I am.

All right. Then break it
off with the new girl.

Now, let's not do anything rash.
She's really hot.

If you like this girl so much,
just end things with Priya.

Priya and I are in love. I think
we could get married someday.

You're looking for a way to
sleep with both women...

- ...and have everybody be happy about it.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

What does your gut tell you?

"Go ask Penny.
She'll know what to do."

Hello, Howard.

I've realized that you
scaring me was all in jest.

Allow me to say, job well done.

[ENERGY CRACKLING]

[GRUNTING]

[GASPS]

Perfect.

- What are you doing?
- Science. You wouldn't understand.

Okay, well, see you. I'm going out.

I thought you were leaving
the apartment.

Yeah, me too.
I can't make up my mind.

Are you concerned because the world
is filled with big dogs and bullies?

No, I'm having a moral crisis.

Well, if it's of any help, I've read
all the great moral philosophers...

...including Dr. Seuss.

Oh, what the hell?

I'm supposed to go see that girl
from the comic book store, Alice.

But I don't know if I should, because I'm
going out with Priya, but she's in India.

All right. So the topic at
hand is sexual fidelity.

Probably won't be relying
on Seuss here.

<i>Although One Fish Two Fish
Red Fish Blue Fish...</i>

...might be surprisingly applicable.

- Go on.
- Well, uh, they say at the end of your life...

...you regret the stuff you didn't
do more than the stuff that you did.

And I'm pretty sure Alice
is the stuff I wanna do.

You know, the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche...

...believed that morality
is just a fiction...

...used by the herd of
inferior human beings...

...to hold back the few superior men.

That actually does help.

It's worth noting that
he died of syphilis.

Screw it, I'm going.

On your way home, will you
pick up orange juice?

Do you mind? I'm questioning
a lot of things in my life.

Is one of those things your
fondness for orange juice?

- No.
- Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

[DOOR BELL RINGS]

- Hey, Sheldon.
WOMAN: Who is it?

It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

That's not my mom. It's Bernadette.

Really? That's very unsettling.

- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hi.

- What's up?
- It just occurred to me...

...that I never formally congratulated
you on your pending nuptials.

I hopped on the first bus and hightailed
it down here to shake your hand.

Put her there, you old so-and-so.

Well, uh... I'm gonna see
you at work in 12 hours.

Don't you think it could
have waited until then?

Holy smoke,
why didn't I think of that?

You're a better man than
I, Howard Wolowitz.

You put her there, you son of a gun.

Whatever. Heh.

[GRUNTS]

MY"...

it's...

Oh, my God, Howie!
What did you do?

It was a harmless Halloween prank.
Look.

Howard has a heart condition.
You know that.

Well, I thought he made that up.

Isn't hypochondria a common
idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

This is adrenaline. We're gonna
inject it into his heart.

- We are?
- You are. I'm not strong enough...

...to get it through his chest
plate and we've only got one shot.

Oh, no, I can't!

Hurry! We're running out of time!

- Okay.
- Just do it!

Oh, God! One, two, three.

Aah!

<i>Trick or treat, bubbeleh.</i>

What?

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

No. You mean this was all a ruse?

Oh, how could I be so stu...?

[ENERGY CRACKLING]

[ALICE MOANING]

Damn it, I can't... I can't do this.

Is it my tongue stud?

If that freaks you out, you're
in for a real surprise later.

[STAMMERS]
No, no, no. I can't do this.

Believe me, I really want to.

- But?
- But I kind of have a girlfriend.

- Are you kidding?
- Uh, you're cool with being friends, right?

Heh. I don't believe this.

Wait, I don't... Which part?

Heh. I'm so stupid. I thought
for once I'd met a good guy...

- ...but you're just another jackass.
- Oh, no, you have it wrong.

No, I was going to be a
jackass, but I stopped myself.

I stayed a good guy, so I'm
gonna pass on the sex.

But you should know, that's not
a comment on your hotness...

...but on my goodness.

That's kind of my superpower. I'm...
I'm like Captain Good Guy.

[SIGHS]

It's okay. Did the right thing.

You idiot!

<i>- Hey, Priya.
- Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?</i>

Uh. Not so good. We have to talk.

<i>Oh. Sounds serious. What's up?</i>

Okay, uh, here it is.

I met this girl and I kissed her
and I feel terrible about it.

But it's done, it's never
gonna happen again...

...and I am so, so sorry.

<i>Leonard, relax. It's okay.</i>

<i>- It is?
- Yeah, these things happen.</i>

<i>They happen to everybody.</i>

Oh, my God, you are amazing. I
mean, heh, I don't deserve you.

What... What do you mean, "everybody"?

<i>Leonard, I didn't know
if I should tell you...</i>

<i>...but I kind of cheated on you too.</i>

Uh, you... "Kind of"?

<i>A couple of weeks ago, I
slept with my ex-boyfriend.</i>

<i>So I guess we both
messed up a little.</i>

No, no, I messed up a little.
You messed up a lot.

<i>Well, it's not a competition.</i>

Oh, yeah, it is and you won.

[STAMMERS]
I'm sorry, I have to go.

I don't believe this.

[BOTH SCREAMING]

Buzzinga, punk. Now we're even.

[English - US - SDH]

So, Bernadette, how goes the
hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

Well, if you don't mind looking
like an orange traffic cone, great.

Girlfriends, I have the
answer to our dress problems.

BERNADETTE: Really? AMY:
Twelve years ago...

...my cousin Irene and her
entire family died...

...in a horrific carbon-monoxide
accident the night before her wedding.

- That's horrible.
- Yes and no.

All those bridesmaids
dresses remain unused...

...and available to us for free.

So it seems that cloud of
odorless, deadly gas...

...had a silver lining after all.

Check it out, still in the bags.
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

I don't know. Dead people's dresses?

Yeah, and cap sleeves? Ehh...

Hmm. I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

Irene was a slave to a good bargain
when it came to clothes...

...and, sadly, as it
turned out, space heaters.

Ladies, please.

These four walls once housed
an intellectual salon...

...where the mind received
nourishment as well as the stomach.

But through no one's fault, Penny...

...the quality of dinner conversation
in this apartment has declined.

And again, I'm looking at no
one in particular, Penny.

Fine. What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?

Ugh. "What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?"

Why do you hate us?

I've prepared a number of
topics that should appeal...

...to both the advanced and
novice conversationalists.

Okay, that time, you looked at me.

Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster.
Do you even have pores?

Topic one: "Faster-than-light
particles at CERN:

Paradigm-shifting discovery...

...or another Swiss export as
full of holes as their cheese?"

And converse.

- Who wants to look at bridal magazines?
- Oh, me.

Through no one's fault,
Sheldon, we're leaving.

- Wait for moi.
- What? You're leaving?

Sheldon, sometimes you forget,
I'm a lady.

And with that comes an
estrogen-fueled need...

...to page through glossy magazines
that make me hate my body.

- Well.
- New topic:

"Women: Delightfully
mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"

Totally.
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

If you have the right figure
for it, they're adorable.

Hey, Amy, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

Your Neurology Department loaned
me a culture of prions...

...for my research on bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.

She popped by to borrow a
cup of mad cow disease.

[CHUCKLES]

It's hard to make degenerative brain
maladies hilarious, yet somehow you do.

That's fun to have in a lunchroom.

The real fun starts when you
pick the rat to feed it to...

...and maybe you choose the beady-eyed
mother who's been biting you all week.

Please, we're eating. Can we get that
off the table and change the subject?

Can we? Stand back...

...while I turn this conversation
into a "conver-sensation."

This time, it's your fault.

I have 100 alphabetized topics...

...from "Artichoke: Come on, people,
it's just a giant thistle"...

...to "Zzz:
The onomatopoetry of sleep."

Amy, how long would it take for
that mad cow disease to kill me?

I don't know, four or five years.

No, that's not gonna do it.

Oi. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

- They're out shopping right now?
- Yeah.

- Just the two of them?
- I guess.

That's cool, that's cool.

Why are they asking me about this?

What guy knows what a
sweetheart neckline is?

[PANTING]

Leonard's coming down
the home stretch.

Come on, horsey, you can do this.

Damn. Come on, thigh
muscles, you can do this.

Yes! First place.

[GASPS]

I would have been a great
jockey if I weren't too tall.

And scared of horses.

Sheldon, you're up.

- What?
- Come on, it's your turn.

We said we'd get more fresh air.

Sorry. I'm a little distracted. I
can't seem to get in touch with Amy.

I tried e-mail, video
chat, tweeting her...

...posting on her Facebook
Wall, texting her, nothing.

Did you try calling her
on the telephone?

The telephone.

You know, Leonard, in
your own simple way...

...you may be the wisest of us all.

Voicemail.

Tsk. Curiouser and curiouser.

If you're worried, we can go
and see if she's all right.

Okay.
You know, I heard in the news...

...a bobcat has been spotted
in her neighborhood.

I don't think Amy was eaten
by a bobcat.

Who thinks Amy was eaten
by a bobcat?

- You do?
- Leonard...

...I was just mentioning an
interesting local news item.

Now, thanks to you, I'm worried
Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

Forget about the bobcat.

SHELDON: How can I? You won't
stop talking about it.

[STRUMMING]

<i>[SINGING] Everybody hurts</i>

<i>Sometimes</i>

<i>Everybody cries</i>

[WHIMPERING]

<i>Everybody hurts</i>

Sometimes.

She sounds weepy. I don't like weepy.
Let's go.

Hey. She's your friend. Step up.

Amy, Amy, Amy. Bye.

- Where are you going?
- I'm single. I don't need this crap.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

You didn't respond to any of
my electronic communications.

I wanted to be alone.

Would you like to talk about it?

And keep in mind that "no" is
a perfectly viable answer.

Sheldon,
my world is crumbling around me.

Point of order.

As you're in distress...

...it would be customary for me
to offer you a hot beverage.

But I'm a guest in your home...

...so it would be customary for
you to offer me a beverage.

How do you wanna proceed
vis-Ã©-vis beverages?

It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

If you'd like to take your mind
off what's troubling you...

...uh, word on the street is
a bobcat has been spotted.

Penny and Bernadette went shopping
for bridesmaids dresses without me.

And that made you feel sad?

- Yes.
- I knew it.

Just keep going.
I guess I'm good at this.

It's just, I thought they
liked hanging out with me...

...but I guess I was fooling myself.

When they were over here...

...did you fail to offer them
a beverage?

Because I can see how that
could stick in someone's craw.

Sheldon, I'm gonna ask you something,
and I'd like you to keep an open mind.

Always.

At this moment, I find myself
craving human intimacy...

...and physical contact.

Oh, boy.

You know ours is a
relationship of the mind.

Proposal: One wild night
of torrid lovemaking...

...that soothes my soul
and inflames my loins.

Counterproposal:

I will gently stroke your head...

...and repeat, "Aw, who's a good Amy?"

How about this?

French-kissing...

...Seven Minutes in Heaven,
culminating in second base.

Neck massage...

...then you get me that beverage.

We cuddle. Final offer.

Very well.

Oh, boy.

I'm just saying, second
base is right there.

Mm. I'm thinking about adopting
some quirky affectation...

...like a pipe or a monocle
or a handlebar mustache.

For all those girls out there looking
for the Indian Monopoly man?

This is not a safe place. You
can't share anything here.

The two of you need to
get your women in line.

- What?
- Last night I was strong-armed...

...into an evening of harp music and
spooning with an emotional Amy.

This on a night that I had
originally designated...

...for solving space-time geometry
in higher-spin gravity...

...and building my Lego Death Star.

And Why?

Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette...

...went out shopping for some
wedding nonsense without Amy...

...an action they took with no thought
as to how it would affect me...

...the future of string
theory or my Lego fun time.

What do you want us to do about it?

You weren't listening
to my topic sentence.

Get your women in line.

Make them apologize to Amy
and set things right.

I am a man of science, not
someone's snuggle bunny.

Why do I have to talk to Penny?
She's not my girlfriend.

You invited her to lunch
four years ago.

Everything about her is on you.
You make it so.

- Moo Shu is Penny.
- Thank you.

- Where's Sheldon?
- Oh, he was up late last night...

...so I gave him an early
dinner and put him to bed.

That's so sweet.

Yeah, but now he's gonna be
up at dawn and wanna play.

So listen, guys, the
reason he was up late...

...is because he was taking care
of Amy.

- She's kind of upset.
- Why?

Her feelings got hurt because you
went dress shopping without her.

I told you that would happen.

This is her first time being a bridesmaid,
and she's getting a little crazy with it.

She keeps on telling us stories about
bridesmaid traditions in other cultures...

...and they're all about getting
naked and washing each other.

She keeps trying to figure out
if our cycles have synced up...

...so we can call ourselves
"The Three Menstra-teers."

We thought it would be easier to look
at dresses one time without her.

- I feel terrible.
- I know, me too. We'll talk to her.

Hey, wait, how did she find out?

Raj did it. Ugh.

And he says he would do it again.

Okay, I'm sorry.

You sent me the picture.
I wasn't thinking.

- Oh, Howie.
- I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing.

You tell me tons of stuff about
these guys, and I never repeat it.

- What do you tell him?
- Oh, you know, just pillow talk.

You guys have nothing to worry about.

Did you talk about us
when we were dating?

No. All your little secrets are fine.

Yes, absolutely fine.

Ha-ha-ha. I'll tell you later.

AMY:
Come on, tumor.

Come on, tumor.

Mama needs an aggressive
little glioblastoma.

Yay, brain tumor.

Probably not the same reaction
you had when you got the news.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

- Hi.
- Hello.

What are you doing here?

Well, uh, we just wanted to apologize...

...for not bringing you
with us the other day.

That's not necessary. It's
like Sesame Street says:

"One of these things is
not like the others.

One of these things should die alone."

No, come on, Amy, let
us make it up to you.

We'll have a girls' night.
We'll do whatever you want.

We can go down to the Korean
baths and do that thing...

...where we wash each other.

With loofah mitts, no hands.

It's okay. I'm glad this happened.

I can stop pretending that
some beautiful girl...

...and her cute-in-the-right-light
friend wanna hang outwith me.

- Amy, we're really sorry.
- Yeah, we feel awful.

Don't. I'll be okay.

You're not the first girls I thought
were friends who ended up shunning me.

It's like elementary school, junior high,
high school, undergrad, grad school...

...and that semester abroad
in Norway all over again.

Oh, come on, Amy.

You don't get it.

Look at this brain.

I don't really want to.

This is us.

Bernadette, you are the analytical,
scientific left hemisphere.

Penny, you're the creative,
spontaneous right hemisphere.

And where's Amy?

She's right here.

The sad little tumor no one wants
to go dress shopping with.

Amy, you're not a tumor. Penny,
tell her she's not a tumor.

[RETCHING]

[PHONE RINGING]

Did you know that when
Alexander Graham Bell...

...invented the telephone, he
proposed answering it with "ahoy"?

Ahoy.

I like it.

Amy? Is that you?

Have you been drinking?

I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

Well, all right. We're on our way.

What's going on?

Well, it would seem Amy is drunk
in a liquor-store parking lot.

Really? Amy?

Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman.
They are a handful.

Oh, look. It's Sheldon and little Leonard.
Hi, little Leonard.

- Hi, Amy.
- Hey, Cuddles.

Cuddles?

Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled.
Grow up, Leonard.

Amy, what are you doing here?

Well, I came here to get
a bottle of wine...

...like Penny taught me
to do when you're sad.

Yeah, but why didn't you
go back to your apartment?

Didn't you go to high school? Parking
lots are where cool kids hang out.

Not that the rat bastards
ever invited me.

- Maybe we should get you home.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon...

...what would it take for you
to go into that liquor store...

...buy a bottle of hooch, take me
across the street to that motel...

...and have your way with me'?

Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?

I'm begging both of you,
please, let's go.

Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.

Whee. Ooh! Finally, someone
found second base.

I know how you feel.

I got a knife slicing through
my frontal lobe too.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Hi.

What do you want'?

Do you want me to give the
friendship bracelet back?

I never gave you a friendship bracelet.

When we met, I made one and
pretended you gave it to me.

You can have it back if you want.

No, you made that for you.
I want you to have it.

We know you're upset, and you
have every right to be...

...but we'd like a second
chance to make things right.

We are really sorry.

We were trying to think of some way to
show you how much we care about you.

Which is why
it would mean so much...

...if you would agree to be the
maid of honor at my wedding.

What?

Wait, is this some kind
of practical joke?

Like in Norway when my "friends" trapped
me in a sauna with a horny otter?

No. I... I want you to
be the maid of honor.

Oh, my gosh.

No one's ever asked me
to be the maid of honor.

Well, that's not true. Once,
but then they all died.

- So is that a yes?
- Yes, heh. Yes.

Oh, my gosh, I...
I have so much to do.

There's the bridal shower
and the bachelorette party.

What should we do for the bachelorette?
Oh, I know.

Go to a Native American sweat
lodge, take peyote, roll in mud...

...and paint symbols on
Bernadette's naked body.

So that's happening.

Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun too. Heh.

I feel like crying. Of
course, I could be hormonal.

Oh, wait. Maybe our menses
are finally syncing up.

- Bernadette? No'? Penny?
- Sorry.

- Really?
"Okay, yeah.

Yay!

Maid of honor Amy Farrah Fowler's...

...amazing behind-the-scenes
wedding video...

...take one.

We're just trying on dresses. Do
we really need to record this?

I'm sorry, are you the maid of honor?

I am the bride.

So no. And action.

- What do you think?
- I love it.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

AMY:
What are you, a nun?

Come on, bestie,
let's see some skin.

BERNADETTE:
Oh, Amy, looking sexy.

You think they don't have mirrors in there?
I know how I look.

PENNY:
Oh.

Bernadette, you look beautiful.

AMY: You do.
- Thank you.

Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.

AMY:
Come on, bestie, you're up.

PENNY:
Give me a minute.

AMY:
What is taking you so long?

Oh, Amy, get the hell out of here.

AMY:
Sorry, sorry. Oh, God.

- Amy!
AMY: Sorry!

[English - US - SDH]

[DOOR OPENS]

- Hey.
- Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?

Yeah. Got 8 pounds of salmon
that's about to go bad.

- Do you know how to cook it?
- Not really.

PENNY: Damn it. Should've
liberated the iffy chicken.

So, what are you and Professor
Fussyface up to tonight?

Star Wars on Blu-ray.

Haven't you seen that
movie a thousand times?

Not on Blu-ray.

Only twice on Blu-ray.

Oh, Leonard. Ugh.

LEONARD: I know. It's
high-resolution sadness.

Well, I was gonna take myself
out to a movie tonight.

You wanna go?

- Really? Do we do that?
- What do you mean?

You know, we haven't spent time
alone together since we broke up.

It's not a date, Leonard. It's a
man and a woman hanging out...

...not having sex
at the end of the night.

LEONARD:
Sounds like most of my dates.

SHELDON: Oh, dear Lord. Get
away from me, you monster.

What is that about?

He's smart and crazy enough. He may
have actually created a monster.

Shoo, shoo.

Be gone.

What the hell is going on?

There's a bird outside the
window and he won't go away.

That is the hell that is going on.

We have no worms or seeds here.
Shoo, shoo.

Really? On top of everything
else, you're afraid of birds?

It's called ornithophobia, and someday it
will be recognized as a true disability...

...and the landlord will be required by
law to put a giant net over the building.

Which is unfortunate, because
I have a fear of nets.

So movies, yes or no?

- Oh, movies, yes.
PENNY: Mm.

Great. I'll see you later. And
remember, he's more afraid of you...

- ...than you are of him.
- That doesn't help.

PENNY:
Oh.

I was talking to the bird.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
Go away, bird.

Sheldon, just ignore him.

Good idea.
Attention is what birds want.

Oh.

Much better. All right.

Now I'll just get along with my life.

[BIRD SQUAWKS]

Make a pot of tea, Leonard,
it's gonna be a long night.

[MIMICKING CAT MEOWING]

[MIMICS CAT HISSING]

Bird still there?

- Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
- I don't know, uh...

Scree, scree.

Please, that's a seagull. If you're
not going to help, don't help.

Sorry. Hey, do you think
I'm over-dressed?

Uh, it depends on the activity.
For a prostate exam, yes.

If you're playing Vegas,
I'd add sequins.

I'm going to the movies with Penny.

I don't want her to think
I think it's a date.

- Do you think it's a date?
- No.

But she might think I think it's
a date, even though I don't.

Or you think she thinks
you think it's a date.

- Are we over-thinking this?
- Not at all.

- You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
- Really? A blazer? All right.

Yes, hello. Uh, this
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

I'm at 2311
North Los Robles Avenue.

I'd like to report a
dangerous wild animal.

A blue jaY...

I'm sorry, this is Animal Control.
I don't understand the laughter.

No, the bird is not in my home.

If he was in my home, I
obviously would've called 911.

I have no doubt that there are
things that you're frightened of.

Uh, being stuck in a
dead-end public service job.

Or your wife stepping out on you...

...because you're stuck in a
dead-end public service job.

Or spiders.

Don't you think
I tried making cat noises?

Too casual?

For an audience with the Queen, yes.

For an evening of passing a bottle of
fortified wine around a trash can...

...you look great.

[MEOWS AND HISSES]

What am I thinking? Whiskers.

Oh, hey, if we hurry we can make
the Jennifer Aniston movie.

Oh, yeah, sure.

Yeah, uh, there's also an
amazing documentary...

...about building a dam on
a river in South America.

Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston
movie has Jennifer Aniston.

And she's not building a dam.

- Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.
- Okay.

Actually, you know what?

I think it's about time
I pick a movie we see.

Wha...? You picked plenty of movies.

No, you always picked and
it was always the same.

An hour and a half of beach houses...

...until the woman turns around and
realizes love was here all along.

Come on, that is a great movie.
And it starts in ten minutes.

But I hate those movies.

- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

The only reason I went is because you
wanted to see them and I wanted sex.

To this day I can't see a
Sandra Bullock poster...

...without getting both bored
and aroused.

So while we were going out, how
often would you pretend...

...to like things just
to have sex with me?

All the time.

You're kidding.

Does this sound familiar?

"I'd love to go
shoe shopping with you."

"Hiking, it's great."

"It's <i>2</i> a.m., of course, I
wanna go to Koreatown...

...and sing karaoke with your friends.
Who wouldn't?"

Okay. We were going out. You
were gonna get sex anyway.

Really? You would've slept with me after
a three hour documentary on dams?

No. No woman would.

See, now, that's the great thing.
We're out as friends.

This is not a date. Sex is off the table.

So let's go learn why
hydroelectric power...

...might not be the environmental
bargain you think it is.

Sorry, spoiler alert.

- Ugh. All right. Fine.
- Thanks.

Uh, tickets are 11 bucks.

Not a date.

Come on, Sheldon. Star Wars.

I'm pushing play. I mean it.

Yeah, if we don't start soon, George
Lucas is gonna change it again.

This would go a lot faster if
you put your diploma to work...

...and help me set up this
high-frequency tone generator.

I have a master's degree from MIT.

Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude,
and that's what's important.

I really don't get your
problem with birds.

The question you should be asking
is, what is their problem with me?

My first memory, a hummingbird
dive-bombing my stroller...

...to get at the apple
juice in my sippy cup.

Hummingbirds are pretty.

Hummingbirds are the vampires
of the flower world.

Still my first choice
for an ankle tattoo.

Or a dolphin. I go back and forth.

Age 7, a blood-thirsty
chicken chases me up a tree.

Age 12, a magpie tries to steal
the retainer out of my mouth.

Age 16, a parrot in a pet
store calls me fat ass.

Need I go on?

Yes, please. This is way
better than the movie, heh.

All right, Sheldon. Your
bird death ray is ready.

It's not a death ray. It's just a little
ultrasonic blast to scare him off.

Trust me, if I had a death ray,
I wouldn't be living here.

I'd be in my lair enjoying the money
the people of Earth gave me...

...for not using my death ray.

All right. And in three, two, one.

[HIGH-PITCH TONE]

RAJ ESH:
That is one tough birdie.

[CHUCKLING] Come on,
you enjoyed the movie.

I saw you tearing up when the village
flooded and everyone had to relocate.

No, I was thinking how come
they get to leave and I can't.

[CHUCKLES]

I'm gonna get some fries.
You want anything?

- Uh, no, thanks.
- Are you sure?

Because you always say no, and
then you eat half my fries.

I just eat the little
crispy ones you don't like.

No, I love them. I save them for the end,
but they're gone because you ate them.

And why did I let you eat them?

- To get sex.
- Exactly.

But this is not a date.

So I ask again.
Would you like anything?

- All right. I'd like an order of fries.
- Great. That'll be 5 dollars.

I am having the best time.

I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

- Oh. Sorry.
- No problem.

- What you writing there?
- Uh, a screenplay.

It's about a guy whose roommate is
having sex and tells him to go...

...and work on his screenplay.

<i>'I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie</i>

- It's a working title.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

- I'm Kevin.
- Oh, Penny.

Nice to meet you.

- I'll let you get back to your date.
- Oh, no, no. This isn't a date. No.

Right?

Uh, right.

So have you written
anything I might have seen?

That depends. How much
time do you spend on Yelp?

[LIGHTSABERS BUZZING ON TV]

[BIRD SQUAWKING]

This is ridiculous.

I'm a grown man from Texas.

This isn't a terrifying bird
like a swan or a goose.

It's just a blue jay.

That's a pretty big blue jay.

One, two, three.

Go. Shoo.

[BIRD SQUAWKING]

Bird in the apartment.
Bird in the apartment.

No!

So it is an amazing documentary.

They need electricity from the dam...

...but at the same time, they
wanna preserve the environment.

You're kidding me.

- Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
- Oh, sure. Just one sec?

No problem.

- What's up?
- I know what you're doing.

- What?
- You're going to talk to that guy...

- ...because I said we weren't on a date.
- I'm talking to him because he's cute.

- Uh, come on. He's not that cute.
- Yes, he is...

...with his dorky T-shirt and
his little hipster glasses.

I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

Yes, but when you're tall and have great
cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.

- So, what if I start talking to a girl?
- You should.

- Yeah, heh. I'm serious, I'll do it.
- Good, go.

There's some girls right over there.

- What are you waiting for?
- They're in a group. I'm scared.

Sheldon,
what do you expect us to do?

You're biologists. Biology is
the study of living things.

That's a living thing. Get cracking.

I specialize in microorganisms
and Amy studies brains.

Yeah, neither of us
minored in bird shooing.

Oh, come, now.
Your undergraduate work...

...must've included a
varmints and critters class.

Come back in, Sheldon.
He's not gonna hurt you.

He looks friendly. I think
he might be someone's pet.

What? No, Bernadette.
Don't be a hero.

- Aw, he's a sweetie.
- Yes. He's very sweet.

Now slowly and carefully
flush him down the toilet.

Sheldon, the only way to get past
this fear is to interact with it.

Just like you did with the mailman.

Every year, tens of people around
the world are killed by birds.

I'm not going to be another statistic.

Look how sweet he is.
Come over and say hi.

Come on, you can do it.

Don't be scared.

[GASPS]

Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby.

[GASPS]

I did it, heh.

I actually did it.

Okay, now ï¬ush him.

So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

Um, let's see.

Hiking.

Karaoke in Koreatown.

Any Jennifer Anniston movie.

- Hey, sorry I ditched you.
- No, it's fine. Ditch away.

Oh, no. We were gonna hang out.
Let's hang out.

- It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
- No, he had to leave.

Interesting.

So now that he's gone, you
wanna hang out with me.

- This must be Penny.
- Yep.

I totally get it.

- Uh, I'm sorry. Get what?
- Don't worry about it.

There's guys over there.
Go talk to them.

- No, no. I wanna know what you told her.
- That's kind of between me and...

- Laura.
- Laura.

Oh, okay, I see. So while he
was telling you things...

...did he mention he owns not
one, but two Star Trek uniforms?

- Really?
- Yeah. Wears them.

Not just for Halloween.

Hey, pal.

You didn't see me telling Kevin
that you thought cold wars...

...were only fought in winter.

Okay, then I'll return the favor...

-...and I won't tell...
- Laura.

...Laura that half the dirty
movies you own are animated.

When you were telling Kevin
about your acting career...

...did you mention your
long-running role as waitress...

...in a local production
of The Cheesecake Factory?

Did you tell her about
your lucky asthma inhaler?

Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.

A-S...

Take me home.

Maybe I'm not done hanging out...

You're right, it's getting late.

It's remarkable.

All that time spent in fear. For what?

He's magnificent.

Ah! Oh, dear. I just realized I
haven't offered you a beverage.

Aw, it's just like my
grandma with her parrot.

And after she lost her marbles,
with her remote control.

My phone's on the desk over there.
Take a picture of us together.

Make it good enough to go on a
mug, a mouse pad and a calendar.

If you were a dove, I'd
call you Lovey Dovey.

Oh, who am I kidding? This isn't a moment
for strict adherence to the literal.

You're just my little
Lovey Dovey, aren't you?

I guess you gotta have hollow bones
to get some sugar around here.

I still think
he looks like someone's pet.

Maybe we should put up posters.

Yes, it should have a big
picture of him and the words:

"Is this your bird? Not anymore."

We're gonna have
so much fun together.

You can carry messages
to all my enemies.

And, um...

I can tie a string to your
leg and fly you like a kite.

If you're keeping him, I've
got a cage you can borrow.

One of the test monkeys slipped on
a banana peel and broke his neck.

It was both tragic and hysterical.

Nonsense. No, Lovey Dovey
doesn't sleep in a cage.

No, Lovey Dovey sleeps
in his very own nest...

...which I'm going to get off the
window sill and put in my room.

Isn't that right, L.D.?

No.

Where are you going?

Come back, Lovey Dovey.
This is your home now.

I already ordered 20 pounds
of bird feed off of Amazon.

- He's gone.
- I'm sorry, Sheldon.

How could he do this to me?

Get back here you stupid
bird so I can love you!

[PENNY SIGHS]

[BOTH slc3l-l]

Okay, so we went out, saw a movie...

...met some nice people, said horrible
things about each other in public.

All in all, a pretty magical night.

PENNY: Okay, I'm not innocent in all this,
but you basically called me stupid...

...you asthmatic dumb-ass.

I know, uh, I crossed the line.
And I'm sorry.

And no, no, uh, I really mean it. It's
not like when we were going out...

...I'd just apologize for everything
so we could end up in bed.

This is a 100 percent "sex
is off the table" I'm sorry.

All right. Thank you. I'm sorry too.

Just to be clear, sex is
off the table, right?

Way off.

Maybe we're not ready
to hang out asfï¬ends.

I don't know. Up until the last part...

...I was enjoying take-charge
Leonard with a little backbone.

Picking the movie, knowing
what he wants, a little cocky.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Well, then, I'm putting
sex back on the table.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

What do you think about that?

Hmm, maybe I like it.

If that's what you like, I can be that guy.
I'll be anything you want me to be.

Good night, Leonard.

[LEONARD SIGHS]

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

I am such an asthmatic dumb-ass.

I had a weird night.

Mine was great.

I'm going to be a mommy.

[English - US - SDH]

It's amazing people keep
coming to comic book stores...

...instead of just downloading
comics digitally.

It's probably for the best.

For a lot of these guys,
the weekly trip here...

...is the only chance their mom has to go
to the basement and change their sheets.

[ALL CHUCKLE]

Oh, that reminds me, I get
fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

Well, what do you think
of new comic book night?

Magic, huh?

Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

As a brilliant man, you're
entitled to a vice.

I could understand
frequenting an opium den...

...or hunting your fellow man
for sport.

But this? Lame-0.

A, comic books employ storytelling
through sequential art...

...a medium that dates back 17,000 years
to the cave paintings of Lascaux...

...and B, you play the
harp, like that's cool.

Can I help you find anything?

A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom
can't be used as a flotation device.

Sorry. Most of the guys who
come in here like big boobs.

A couple of them have big boobs.

The new Warlords of Ka'a
expansion pack is out.

A new one? Unbelievable.

They just keep making up
more cheesy monsters...

...slapping them on cards and
selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

It's like a secret tax on
guys who can't get laid.

They're not even trying. Remember the
Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?

Absurd. What was he, a bad elephant
who died and went to hell?

What could an elephant possibly do that
would cause him eternal damnation?

"Wild West and Witches."

What kind of loser cares
about a showdown...

...between Billy the Kid and the
White Wizard of the North? Heh.

A total loser.

Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter
beats an old man with a magic wand.

Well, ho... hold on.

Uh, what if the wizard casts a
helmet-of-confusion spell...

...on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

What? Please. This is Billy
the Kid we're talking about.

The wizard would get shot before
he could get out the words:

"What the hell is Billy the Kid
doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

Leonard, ahem...

...what's the deal with
Sheldon's friend Amy?

- Are they a couple?
- A couple of weirdos. Why?

[ALL CHUCKLE]

Are you interested in Amy?

Well, I mean, she didn't
look through me...

...with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling
hatred and contempt.

I like that in a woman.

Could you run it by Sheldon
if I could ask her out?

Sure, I guess.

Stuart, settle an argument for us.

Who would win, Billy the
Kid or the White Wizard?

[CHUCKLES]

If I tell you that, I'm robbing you
of the hours of fun you could have...

...for the magical, rootin'-tootin
low price of 24.95.

- I'll take one.
- Mm. Make it two.

I hate all of you and myself. Three.

I'll ring it up.

Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

Hey, can I talk to you about something?
It's a little awkward.

I know what this is about.

Given the professional
standstill you're at...

...you're wondering if this
is the appropriate time...

...to abandon your research
and focus on teaching.

Yes.

And if I may suggest, consider
changing disciplines.

Yeah, to the humanities.
Perhaps, history.

One of the advantages
of teaching history...

...is that you don't
have to create things.

You know, you just have to
remember stuff that happened...

...and then parrot it back.

You could have fun with that.

Yeah, that's not it.

Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.

Well, of course, he is.
She's very interesting.

Did you know, when she was 14...

...she severed the webbing
between her own toes?

No. Uh...

He wanted me to find out if you'd have
a problem with him asking her out.

Well, I'm not sure how
to respond, Leonard.

I mean, I don't own Amy.
You can't own a person.

At least, not since...

1863.

President Lincoln freed the...

The slaves. Come on, Leonard, if
you're gonna teach history...

...these are the kind of
facts you'll have to know.

You know what? Never mind. I'm gonna
tell him it's okay to ask her out.

The question is moot. There
is no way that Stuart...

...an impoverished peddler
of picture books...

...would be at all appealing
to Amy Farrah Fowler...

...a noted neurobiologist...

...capable of performing
surgery on her own feet...

...with nothing but nitrous oxide from
cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.

All right, but for the record...

...I checked in with you to
see how you'd feel about it.

Fine. The record shall so reflect.

Now, getting back to
the problem at hand...

...what to do with a washed-up
experimental physicist.

I am not washed-up.

Oh, Leonard.

Lots of people love you
and want to help you...

...but they can't until
you admit the problem.

Ugh. Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.

- I had half a glass.
- I didn't have any.

Okay, don'tjudge me.

So, what do you wanna do? Go
to the movies, go dancing...

...lay down for a little bit? Ahem.

Or we play...

...Travel Twister.

Amy, really? Twister?

Excuse me, I've passed many an
enjoyable evening playing this game.

And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting
when you play with other people.

What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins.
I'm shirts. Called it.

[PHONE BUZZES]

I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.

And sitting with my feet on the floor.

Hope you enjoyed the
prenatal cigarettes, mom.

Hey, my mom smoked pot when
she was pregnant with me...

...and I turned outjust fine.

Hey, look, I have peach schnapps.
Thank God.

- Guys, something happened.
- What's wrong?

I think a boy likes me.

"Hi. It's Stuart. We met
at the comic book store.

I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime.
It's okay if you say no.

It might be the kick in the pants
I need to start taking Zoloft."

Amy, you little vixen.

Just working it under all those
layers of wool and polyester.

What are you gonna do? Doesn't
he know you have a boyfriend?

Oh, she doesn't have a
boyfriend, she has a Sheldon.

- So do you like Stuart?
- I don't know.

He's nice. He's funny. He has
the sallow-drawn countenance...

...associated with an overactive thyroid gland.
That's kind of hot.

Look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but
you've been with him over a year now.

If it's not going anywhere, what
does it hurt to look around?

Yeah, I guess they're not
engaged like me and Howie.

For what it's worth, engaged people can look around too.
Lot of options out there.

Where's Stuart?

[SNICKERS]

Out.

- Who are you?
- I'm Dale. He left me in charge.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I don't get it either.

I wanna return this Wild West and
Witches Ka'a expansion pack.

Sorry, I don't do returns. They're hard.

Sure, sure.

- Uh, when will Stuart be back?
- I don't know. He went out for coffee.

With a girl.

[CHUCKLES]

Ah. I guess I was wrong.

You okay?

Am I okay? Leonard, I'm on
a lifelong trajectory...

...that includes a Nobel Prize
and cities named after me.

All four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in
my mouth without need of extraction...

...and my bowel movements run
like a German train schedule.

Am I okay?

I'm okay too.

Wild Bill Witchcock.

A tribe of Abra-Comanches.

Flaming Spittoon.

And for the record, I'm very
disappointed in you, cowpokes.

We're playing our inaugural round
of Wild West and Witches...

...and I'm the only one who
bothered to dress for the occasion.

Patooie.

We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon.
It looks ridiculous.

And I suppose my boots and
spurs are ridiculous too?

HOWARD & LEONARD: Yeah.
RAJESH: Incredibly so.

Did it look ridiculous when
we got the Satanimals pack...

...and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?

HOWARD & LEONARD: Yeah.
RAJESH: Incredibly so.

All right, fine. Let's just play.

We should go easy on him.
Amy's outwith Stuart tonight.

Wait a minute. Are you telling me...

...that Sheldon's patented blend
of condescension and no sex...

...isn't enough to hold on to a woman?

Cluck. Cluck. Cluck. What are
we, ladies at a quilting bee?

Or are we men playing a
fantasy card game...

...set in a magical frontier town?

Sorry.

Creepy Tepee.

Annie Ogly.

Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.

And may I point out, it
is the three of you...

...who are obsessed with
Stuart and Amy, not me.

I think you need to ask yourselves
who's really being ridiculous here.

[SPURS CLANGING]

- It's you.
- You are.

Hey, guys, check it out.

The deluxe limited edition Wild
West and Witches expansion pack...

...in the signed and
numbered collector's tin.

Come on, no. We just
bought the regular pack.

Ooh. A sheriff's badge. Ha, ha.

Yeah, it's also a wand.

With a hologram? Nice.

Hey, do you see this?

I'm in the matrix,
Leonard, I see everything.

You gotta be kidding me. You
friended Stuart on Facebook?

- I thought you didn't like Facebook.
- Don't be silly.

I'm a fan of anything that tries
to replace actual human contact.

Please. You're looking at Facebook
to find out how their date went.

Really? You think I care if a man...

...what, "Shared a pumpkin
latte with a dynamite lady"?

- You're so full of it.
- You're free to believe whatever you like.

And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.

You unfriended me? Seriously?

Oh, yeah. Now he's gonna miss
all those great updates like:

"I can't believe I waited this long...

[IN INDIAN ACCENT] ...to make
my own potpourri." Ha, ha.

Why don't you acknowledge you
have feelings for Amy...

...and don't want her
going out with other men?

And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.

Here's a radical thought. Go old school.
Challenge Stuart to a fight.

Nothing makes the ladies hotter
than two skinny white guys...

...swatting at each other
with their eyes closed.

And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.

That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?

- Why?
- I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.

PENNY: Who do we love?
- Penny.

Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.

- Thank you.
- What's up?

I came to ask if you would
like to go on a date with me.

I'm sorry, what?

A date. You and me.

Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd
like to take in a prizefight.

[MICROWAVE BEEPS]

Ugh, God, are you trying
to make Amy jealous?

No. Why is everyone so
obsessed with Amy and Stuart?

Whether or not they may be having more
pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.

Okay, listen to me.

Playing games is not
gonna help get Amy back.

I am not trying to get her back.

But out of curiosity, what is a way?

All right, honey,
let me tell you a story.

There was a guy I liked, and
I never told him how I felt.

Eventually, he started going out with
someone else and I always regretted it.

Do you see where I'm going with this?

- I believe I do.
- Hmm.

I'm the guy...

You're not the guy.

Are you sure?
That would explain so much.

Your constant presence
in my apartment...

...that baffling dalliance with
Leonard just to be near me...

...the way you call me
sweetie all the time.

- I call everyone sweetie.
- You tramp.

Ugh.

Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is
strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.

Strap on a pair? Wait. Of what, skates?

Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.

[DRAMATIC STRING MUSIC
PLAYING ON FILM]

If you're bored, you can go.
I understand.

No, I'm having a nice time.

[SCOFFS]

Don't patronize me.

Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

Pardon me. Excuse me.

- Hi, Stuart.
- Hi, Sheldon.

Pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

The thought of you sitting
in a darkened theater...

...with a character like
Stuart is repellent.

- No offense, Stuart.
- None taken.

Although repellent is
kind of a strong word.

I'm sorry this causes you discomfort...

...but based on the currently established
parameters of our relationship...

...I can put myself in any
repellent situation I want.

- Um... Again...
- Stuart, please, you're being rude.

Anything else?

I believe I would like to alter
the paradigm of our relationship.

I'm listening.

With the understanding that
nothing changes whatsoever...

...physical or otherwise...

...I would not object to us no
longer characterizing you...

...as "not my girlfriend."

Interesting. Now try it without
the quadruple negative.

You're being impossible.

Hi, Stuart.

Fine.

Amy...

...will you be my girlfriend?

- Yes.
- Well, that's enough of that.

Sorry to interrupt. You
two enjoy your date.

Here's a dollar for your troubles.
Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.

Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.

Other than you taking your relationship
to the next level with another guy...

...this was nice.

Yes, well, thanks for
seeing me to my door.

Oh, you're welcome.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

SHELDON:
Amy? Amy? Amy?

Let's wrap things up out there.

- Um... Good night, Stuart.
- Good night.

SHELDON: Take the hint, Stuart.
The lady said good night.

How did you get into my apartment?

Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can
expect now that you're my girlfriend?

Good thing I drew this up.

What's that?

I present to you the
relationship agreement.

A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages,
enumerates, iterates and codifies...

...the rights and responsibilities
of Sheldon Lee Cooper...

...here and after known
as "the boyfriend"...

...and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and
after known as "the girlfriend."

It's so romantic.

Mutual indemnification always is.

Why don't you start perusing
while I set up my notary stamp.

"Section 5: Hand-holding.

Hand-holding is only allowed under
the following circumstances.

A, either party is in danger of falling
off a cliff, precipice or ledge.

B, either party is deserving of a hearty
handshake after winning a Nobel Prize.

C, moral support during flu shots."

- Seems a bit restrictive.
- Yeah, well, feel free to retain a lawyer.

Penny, I said, "Right hand, red."

Yeah, I heard you. I got red. Ahem.

Bernadette...

...left foot, yellow.

[BERNADETTE GRUNTS]

We should play limbo next.
No one beats me at limbo.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

SHELDON:
Penny? Amy? Bernadette?

That's my boyfriend.

It's open.

I got a splinter.

What do you want me to do about it?

Relationship Agreement Section
4: Boo-boos and Ouchies.

You have to take care of it.

I should've gotten a lawyer.

Looks like it's just us playing.

[PENNY SNORING]

Penny?

- Penny, we're out of wine.
- You should probably drive.

[English - US - SDH]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hi. Did Sheldon change the
Wi-Fi password again?

Uh, yeah, it's "Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi."

No spaces.

Okay. What makes you think you can
get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

I believe that you're
capable of great change.

Like, when I finally got you to
stop saying "Valentime's Day."

- Wanna hear something weird?
- Sure.

In the year 2000...

...Pope John Paul ll was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

What are you talking about?

You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

Oh. I thought it was a game.

- What's yours?
- There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.

He used to torment me
in high school.

He sent me a message
through Facebook.

- He's in town and wants to have drinks.
- Okay, Penny.

If it were a game,
here are your choices.

An e-mail from an old acquaintance...

...or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...

...slam-dunking to "Sweet
Georgia Brown." Pick.

Just do it, because he's
not gonna let it go.

- Basketball Pope.
- And that's how it's done.

What are you gonna do?

- Are you gonna see him?
- I don't know.

Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

No, that was a different guy.

Was he the one who wedgied you so
hard your testicle reascended..

...and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?

No, that was a different different guy.

Was he the one who used
your head to open a nut?

- No.
- Oh, oh, oh.

Was he the one who made
you eat your arm hair?

No, but actually, that
was this guy's sister.

- Well, what do you think he wants?
- I don't know.

The holidays
are just around the corner.

Maybe he wants to see if he can
lodge the other testicle up there.

I told you. That was a different guy.

Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

[LAUGHS]

It's <i>2</i> a.m. What are you doing up?

Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

Sure. Wanna see what all the
scientists are wearing this year.

Look at these men.

They've managed to win the top
science prize in the world...

...with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...

...of the expansion of the early
universe than God gave a goose.

You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.

- Thanks.
- So, what's got you up?

Did you have a bad clam?

- I didn't have clams.
- I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

I don't know what you do.

It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I
can't decide if I should agree...

...to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...

...he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

Wear loafers.

Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up
there clutching that Nobel Prize.

What's the matter, Saul? Afraid
someone's gonna steal it?

Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

You know what? I am tired of
living in fear of this guy.

I'm gonna go see him...

...and say the things I should
have said in high school.

"Pick on someone your own size."

"No, you did not have sex
with my mother."

And, "Yes, I do know why
I'm hitting myself."

Oh. Now Perlmutter
shaking the king's hand.

Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.

I love this dress.

- How come I never see you wear it?
- Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.

So, what's Howard doing tonight?

Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

Oh. Terrific. High-school
quarterback against four mathletes.

When Leonard gets back, I'd
love to check serotonin levels.

Do you think he'd let me draw
a syringe full of his blood?

Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.

But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.

I don't think I can meet the
girl who was always mean to me.

Tammy Bodnick. One time
while I was in gym class...

...she stole all my clothes and
left an elf costume in my locker.

- Oh, that's awful.
- Worst part was it was too big.

That's nothing. In ninth grade, the
girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

Within six months, the
nicknames began to fly.

I think the one that hurt the
most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

Oh. Wow, you poor thing.

What about you?

Oh, I don't know. My school was a nice place.
We didn't have bullies.

Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...

...or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?

No, we weren't really like that.

We played pranks on each
other, but it was never mean.

This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good
grades so we blindfolded her...

...tied her up and left her
in a cornfield overnight.

- God. That's awful.
- No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

Who would've thought?

Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is
best friends with a bully.

- What...? I was not a bully.
- Kind of sounds like you were.

And maybe a felon.

Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

Is that him over there?

No.

How about that guy? He
looks like he'd hate you.

- I can really do this by myself.
- We're here to support you.

No, you're not. You're here to see if I
get my underwear pulled over my head.

You wore underwear?
Ha, ha. You fool.

- You figured out what you're gonna say?
- You bet.

I am going to make him apologize for all
the crap he pulled on me in school.

That's quite a list. I can't
read your handwriting.

What's that word?

Scrotum.

What's that one?

Uh, stapled.

Leonard?

[LAUGHING]

- Oh, hi.
- Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

Yeah, you too.

Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon,
and Raj, and Howard.

- Hi.
- Fellows. Can I get a beer?

Wow, look at you. Little
Leonard Hofstadter.

I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

- I'm doing okay, I guess.
JIMMY: Okay?

Come on, I read online you're a physicist
at a university. You won some medal.

- The Newcomb medal.
- Yeah. Congratulations.

Congratulations?
For the Newcomb med...?

Oh, please. That's the
scientific equivalent...

...of a smiley-face
sticker on your homework.

- It sounded like a big deal.
- Oh, good Lord.

Are we gonna stand here and listen
to him tear Leonard apart like this?

- Hey, I won a Newcomb medal too.
- My point.

You should've seen this
guy back in the day. Huh?

He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.

Lockers, trash cans.

Oh, man, how did you get
inside that backpack?

Oh, I can't take all the credit.
You helped a lot.

- We were practically a comedy team.
- Like the Black Death in Europe.

Jimmy, I'm kind of curious
why you wanted to see me.

Okay, here it is. I have this
great money-making idea.

I need a gear-head to get
it to the finish line.

Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

What's the idea?

- This is just between us, right?
- Right.

Okay. What do you think about a pair of
glasses that makes any movie into 3D?

That sounds amazing. First
movie I'm watching, <i>Annie.</i>

How exactly
would these glasses work?

How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

I don't think something
like that's even possible.

Aw, come on. You could figure it out.
You're, like, the smartest guy.

The smartest...? All right.

I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,
but, uh, even I know that was a doozy.

You can't live in fear
of this man forever.

- Sheldon, I got this.
- You clearly don't.

What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

...is you're a terrible person who
took advantage of his tiny size...

...his uncoordinated nature, and his
congenital lack of masculinity.

- Sheldon.
- Leonard, I platonically love you, man.

But face it, you're a mess.

I don't understand.

I think what he's trying
to say is that maybe...

...in high school, you
picked on me a little bit.

A little bit? The man super-glued
Hershey's kisses to your nipples.

That's funny because those aren't the
kind of kisses you want on your nipples.

- What is that?
- This is a list...

...of your heinous acts
against Leonard...

...one of which is certainly the cause of
him wetting his bed well into his teens.

Fourteen is not...
Uh, yeah, never mind.

What's this word?

Nancy.

You called me Nancy
for three years.

You really need to work
on your penmanship.

Man, I...

I don't know what to say.

I thought
we were just having some fun.

Well, it wasn't fun for me.

You're being too kind, Leonard.
You ruined him.

Come on, guys.

- That was pretty bad-ass, dude.
- I help the weak.

It's yet another way I'm
exactly like Batman.

And for the record, Jimmy wasn't
the reason I wet the bed.

That one has my mother
written all over it.

Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun
of your stutter in high school.

You're doing great.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.
Oh, God, just finish the sentence.

Ah. Okay, well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

Bye.

- No one wants to hear my apologies.
- Your mistake is doing it over the phone.

I mean, if they could look
into your eyes, they'd melt.

It doesn't matter what you did in the past.
You're a good person.

Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You
weren't just called a "b-b-bitch."

Perhaps you could assuage
your guilt through altruism.

Which word's tripping you up?

Assuage or altruism?

Both.

You'll feel better by doing
something nice for someone.

- Oh, I actually knew that.
- I never doubted you.

Every other week, I serve
at a soup kitchen downtown.

Ooh. I can't do that.

If I stand over a steaming pot,
my hairjust goes: "Boing!"

- Ah. What else can I do?
- There's Habitat for Humanity.

Building houses for the poor.

I don't have my own house, I'm
gonna build one for someone else?

How about donating
some of your clothes?

Oh, my God, that's perfect, because I
have so many clothes I don't wear.

They're taking up space I
go shopping to buy more.

I have no place to put it.
This would fix that.

- What about helping people?
- And helping people.

- Here's your cocoa.
- Oh.

- Half and half instead of whole milk?
- Yes.

- Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
- Yes.

Seven little marshmallows,
no more, no less?

You got one for good luck.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

I'll get it.

One for good luck.

Must be the kind of math
they do at Princeton.

- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

I wanna apologize for
stapling your balls...

...throwing you naked into
the girls' locker room...

...stuffing that parrot
down your pants.

What's this word?

- Laxative.
- Oh.

Right. Junior prom. Ha, ha.

That was not cool, man.

I am so, so sorry.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I just hope you can forgive me.

Uh... Yeah. Sure, I guess.

- You're a beautiful guy.
- Oh, well, yeah. Thanks, Jimmy.

Okay, I gotta go.

- Are you okay to drive?
- Yeah, yeah.

I drive better drunk, you know?

It makes you pay attention.

No. Come on in. I'll make
you a cup of coffee.

- I wouldn't be imposing?
- No.

Yes.

- Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
- Then take away his keys...

...and make him wander the
streets with the other drunks.

You remember Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

Not really, no.

It's funny, huh? Back in school, I was
the winner, and you were the loser.

And now we're reversed.

You're the winner.

You'd think a winner could
make a decent cup of cocoa.

- Mind if I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. It's just back there.

How about that?
After all these years...

...your big, bad high-school
bully finally apologizes.

Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith
in the basic goodness in people.

- You know what would be nice?
- What's that?

As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies
who've tormented us for years...

...we open our home to Jimmy, and
once he's asleep, we kill him.

I said it would be nice. I
didn't say we should do it.

Oh. I feel just like Mother Teresa.

Except for the virgin part. That
ship sailed a long time ago.

I think Mother Teresa would've
washed the clothes first.

Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room
wasn't down five flights of stairs.

You know, giving really
is better than receiving.

Oh. I used to think it was such a
cliche, but it seems to be the...

Ah! Look at these cute jeans
someone just threw away.

Donated.

Yes, to a poor waitress
who loves a boot-out.

- Penny.
- Come on. They would be so cute on me.

Ah! They'd go great with this sweater.

I don't think Mother Teresa would...
Oh, that is adorable.

- Leonard?
- Yeah?

In case it comes up again, this
right here is an imposition.

What was I supposed to do?
He needed a place to sleep.

You're soft. This world's gonna
chew you up and spit you out.

[BURPSI

When did I have tacos?

Morning, Jimmy.

Oh, there it is. Tacos.

- Man, I tied one on.
- Yeah, you did.

So, uh, listen, it was
great to see you again.

And thanks for the apology.

What apology?

For all the crappy stuff you
did to me in high school.

Oh, jeez, you're still harping on that?
What a puss.

- That's my French toast.
- It's good.

You really know your way
around a kitchen, Nancy.

I'm not going to say I told you
so, but we could've killed him.

I might kill him right now.

The Dark Knight has your back.

He's scared, but he has your back.

Hey, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.

- Yeah, let me just finish this.
- No. You're done.

- I want you out of my apartment now.
- Well said, Boy Wonder.

Or what?

Don't answer. That's a trick question.
I speak from experience.

I'm not afraid of you anymore, Jimmy.

Now, get out.

Uh-oh.

You did it.
You stood up to your bully.

Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself.

Do you think we can outrun him?

I don't need to outrun him.
I just need to outrun you.

I don't feel good about this.

Well, then, sit in the
car and keep it running.

You were right. A whole new load.

Come on, yoga top. Momma
needs a new yoga top.

Check it out, Bernadette.
Suede boots. Your size.

God, they're cute. Oh, why
did they have to be cute?

Wait, wait, wait, guys. Just hang on.

What is it? The fuzz?

Oh, look at us. What are we doing?

I was following you
to a life of crime...

...looking forward to the
day we might be cell mates.

I don't know about Bernadette.

No, this is wrong.

Let's put everything back. Come on.

Here.

[PENNY SIGHS]

It's okay, I serve soup to poor people.

[English - US - SDH]

Completely empty box, if
you'd like to examine it.

Mm-hm.

Yep. I see nothing in this
box but a wasted childhood.

Little snarky there, cello lessons.

We have this completely ordinary
cylinder if you'd like to examine it.

Ordinary, yet I sense it is
dripping with magical potential.

Oh, dear Lord.

A man pops out for a moment
to evacuate his bowels...

...and catch up on the adventures of
the Caped Crusader only to emerge...

...and discover his apartment has
been transformed into a cabaret.

Sheldon, he's practicing for
his cousin's birthday party.

As I was saying, empty box,
empty cylinder, and...

Ooh!

VoilÃ .

I'm telling you, there's a seat on the
Hogwart's Express with your name on it.

This is how you're going to entertain
your little cousin and his friends?

- By lying to them?
- How is this lying?

A magic show is an inherently
deceitful proposition.

"This is an ordinary top hat."
"You've chosen that card freely."

"I do not have a set of lock
picks lodged in my keister."

Can't you just enjoy the wonder?

Why must you peek behind the
curtain, or up the butt?

If we poison the critical
thinking faculties of children...

...by telling them rabbits
come out of hats...

...then we create adults who believe
in astrology and homeopathy...

...and Ryan Reynolds was a better
choice for Green Lantern...

...than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.

He's just gonna do a few
magic tricks for some kids.

I really don't think they're gonna end
up liking the Green Lantern movie.

Don't be so hard on him, it's natural
to be a little cranky when you have...

...a quarter in your ear.

Coins lodged in body parts is
not a source of amusement.

When I was five, Billy Sparks
put a Mexican peso up my nose.

[ALL LAUGHING]

- How is that not amusing?
- It's still there.

It takes me 45 minutes to get
through airport security.

Look. I made Sheldon disappear.
Ta-da!

Next time you should open with that.

Ooh! Look who's out on a date.
Pasadena's favorite power couple, Shamy.

And that is the answer
to the question:

"What is wrong with eating
at the Cheesecake Factory?"

So are we celebrating
anything special tonight?

Oh, yes.

Our relationship agreement specifies
the second Thursday of every month...

...or the third Thursday in a month
with five Thursdays is date night.

That is so hot.

All right, without objection, the
minutes of the previous date...

...are considered read and agreed to.
Any new business?

- How was your day?
- Superb.

This morning I made a
palindrome with my Alpha-Bits.

"Nice Hat, Bob Tahecin."

Sounds like you hit the ground running.

I have a bit of good news myself.

My most recent paper on how
cooperative long-term potentiation...

...can map memory sequences
in dendritic branches...

...made the cover of Neuron.

Ooh! peaking of good news, somebody
just hit 100 Twitter followers.

That's nice. Anyway, I've been
dreaming of this day for a long time.

Yeah, me too. Triple digits. I'm
not gonna lie, feels pretty good.

I'm the sole author on a
paper being published...

...in a distinguished journal that
may change the course of my field.

Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Ooh!

One-oh-one! Air's getting
a bit thin up here.

So are we ready to order?

Give me a minute.
I'm gonna go wash up.

Well, that's odd. We both
washed up when we came in.

It's probably a euphemism
for urination.

- Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
- Not much.

Although I can be faulted for
being overly fond of koala bears.

I don't know what it is, when they start
munching on eucalyptus, I melt inside.

Okay. Amy told you some exciting news
and you acted like it was no big deal.

Oh! I see why you're confused. No.

Her news sounded important, but
what you're forgetting is...

...it was an achievement
in the field of biology.

That's all about yucky squishy things.

All right, honey, she's upset.
You're her boyfriend.

You have to at least try to be excited
by the things she's excited by.

- What if they simply don't excite me?
- Well, just smile and think about koalas.

She'd see right through that.
We go to the zoo all the time.

She knows my koala face.

And for future reference, it's this.

Wow, you have a lot of magic stuff.

Yeah, started when I was a teenager.

Thought I could show a girl a few tricks
and invite her up to my bedroom...

...to see the rest of the act.

- Did it work?
- Let's just say...

...the only wand that ever
saw any action was this one.

Oh! Look what my mom
made us for the act.

Ooh! I like the fabric.
Where'd she get it?

Well, she out up one of
her old bathing suits.

She made these two vests
and half a dozen napkins.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Has she
tried on the vest yet?

[YELLING]: I just gave it to her.
- I hope it fits.

She has a tricky figure. She's
short and stacked like me.

She's not stacked like you, Ma.
She never steps on hers.

Listen, Howie. Maybe I'm not the best
choice to be a magician's assistant.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]: You'll do fine.
Hand me those rings?

See? You nailed it.

No, it's just that I'm not that
comfortable with little kids.

That's because you haven't
been around them.

This is good practice. I mean, you
are gonna be a mom someday, right?

Yeah, sure.

Oh, ho, ho!

I haven't seen this trick in years.

It's called the dove pan. You let
everyone see the pan is empty...

...but there's a secret
compartment in the lid.

And then you open it
and produce a live...

[GAGS]

[COUGHING]

Don't look in there.

[SPURS JANGLING ON TV]

Oh, a little "Red Dead Redemption," huh?

- Yes.
- How come you're not doing a mission?

You're just wandering around.

I had a rough night, thought I'd
go for a walk and clear my head.

Some people
go outside and do that.

It's after 9:00. At this hour,
the streets of Pasadena...

...are teeming with drunken
sailors and alley cats.

Do you wanna talk about it'?

No, I think I'll just go in this
saloon and drink my troubles away.

You know digital alcohol
is never a solution.

What's going on?

Hard as this may be to believe...

...it's possible that I'm
not boyfriend material.

Glad I was sitting down for that.

Did you and Amy get in a fight?

Amy had a fight. I was being
perfectly reasonable.

I'm gonna have a whiskey.
Want anything?

No, I can't. I'm playing
"Grand Theft Auto" later.

- Look, I'm no expert in women...
<i>- I'll</i> say.

Not necessary when someone's
trying to help you.

Sorry, it's the alcohol talking.
Go on.

Sometimes with women you wanna
listen to what upsets them...

...and show them that you
can grow and change.

Nuts to that. What else you got?

I don't know what to tell you.
Buy her something.

How does that work?

Well, you skip over any attempt to
repair your emotional connection...

...and you win back her affection
with an empty financial gesture.

Well, that approach has Sheldon
Cooper written all over it.

- Glad I could help.
- It's appreciated.

If you manage to find a woman again,
I'll be glad to return the favor.

And now, all the rings are
magically linked together.

My fiancÃ©e's wearing a magic ring too.
It made all my money disappear.

Oh, oh, right.

[RIMSHOT]

And now, the Great Howdini's
next miraculous illusion.

When are we gonna have cake?

After you've been thoroughly amazed.

But we want cake now.

Well, you're not getting
cake right now, capiche?

Heh, heh, okay, okay.

Now my lovely assistant
is going to bring me...

- ...an ordinary pitcher of milk.
- I know how you do that trick.

Do you know how to pipe down?

Okay, we're going to
roll up this newspaper.

- It's a fake pitcher.
- You got wax in your ears?

The man said it's an ordinary pitcher.

Howdini?

Okay. We're going to stick this
in here.

And then I'm going to pour in
the milk.

Ha, ha, I hope this works because
I didn't bring a change of pants.

Look, I Googled it.
It's a fake pitcher.

That's it. No cake for you. Anyone
else wanna join the No Cake Club?

She's just kidding, boys and girls.
Everyone gets cake.

[WHISPERS]:
Not him.

Just give me the pitcher.

Behold.

Wrong pitcher.

[SIGHS]

I told you I'm not good with kids.

Yes, you did.

I think my crotch is starting to curdle.

The thing is,
my mother worked full-time.

I had to take care of my
brothers and sisters.

- Yeah, so?
- Uh, it was horrible.

With their snotty noses and
their poopy diapers...

...and their little shrieky
voices, always complaining.

"I don't wanna get dressed." "Joey
keeps spitting in my mouth."

"This isn't the way Mom
makes waffles."

Well, okay, put your hand in here.
Let's see how you like this waffle.

All right, settle down.
Red light. Red light.

Red light. Okay, we're fine.

I'm sorry. I know it makes me
sound like a bad person...

- ...but I just don't like children.
- Yeah, no, we all got that.

But don't you think it'll be
different when the child is ours?

Right. When it's our kid that's ruined
my body, kept me up all night...

...and I've got no career, no future,
nothing to be happy about for 20 years.

Sure, that'll be completely different.

Well, yeah.

I don't think there's anything
in this jewelry store...

...that Amy would appreciate more than the
humidifier we're looking at at Sears.

Oh, my God. Now I know what I sound
like to you when I say stupid stuff.

Ooh! A pocket watch.

I don't think Amy
wants a pocket watch.

No, but maybe she wants a
man with a pocket watch.

Still saying stupid stuff.

- Does she like bracelets?
- Well, she's very fond of her silver one...

...that says "allergic to penicillin."

Maybe they have a
dressier version of that.

How are we doing this afternoon?
Looking for anything special?

Perhaps a ring for the lady?

[SNORTS]

Trust me, we are not a couple.

Excuse me. I don't see why you
get to snort derisively...

...and point that out. You'd be
lucky to land a fellow like me.

Fine. Go ahead.

[SNORTS]

Trust me, we are not a couple.

My apologies.
How can I help you today?

He's in trouble with his
girlfriend, needs a present.

Great. Trouble with girlfriends is what's
putting my daughter through U.S.C.

Ooh!

- Are those real diamonds?
- Yes.

Channel-set baguettes,
20 points total weight.

Remarkable. Diamonds.
Crystallized carbon.

Every day, people go to the grocery
store and come home with sacks...

...full of carbon in the form
of charcoal briquettes...

...they toss in their
barbecues and set on fire.

But just because you've got some carbon
with the atoms stacked neatly...

...you expect me to plunk
down thousands of dollars.

Actually, that's only 750.
Everything's on sale.

Really? Talk to me about
that pocket watch.

I'm still trying to
wrap my mind around it.

I always thought
I'd be a dad someday.

Me too. You're so caring.

I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.

There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll
have your babies. Problem solved.

Because a man shows
caring for another man...

...doesn't mean he's displaying the
love that dare not speak its name.

Did she say she didn't want kids?

Yeah. She doesn't like them.

And from what I saw, the
feeling was mutual.

- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

I can't see a life where I don't have kids.
I mean, people have kids.

I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.

So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses...

...and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.

You know, there's no guarantee even if
you have kids you're gonna like them.

Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?

It's right off the dust
jacket of my mom's last book.

Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.

Look, Howard, I'd say there's
a lot of fish in the sea...

...but I watched you dangle
your hook for years.

Do not throw her back.

I don't want to, but this
is kind of a deal breaker.

What will your mom say if
you call off the wedding?

Heh, it'll kill her. If I don't
give her grandchildren...

...that'll kill her too. So either
way on the Mom front, I'm golden.

- What time did you tell Amy to be here?
- Eight o'clock.

- That pocket watch is ridiculous.
- Nonsense.

I look like a train conductor.

Under what pretext
did you lure her here?

I said, "Hey, wanna come
over and hang out?"

Good, good. If you'd said something
clever, she might've gotten suspicious.

- Hey.
- Hi.

- What's he doing here?
- Okay, he wants to talk to you.

Well, I don't wanna talk to him. And
I'm pretty disappointed in you too.

Although we both know
that won't last.

- Sheldon, you're up.
- Thank you.

Amy, I'd like to apologize.

Your accomplishment was
impressive, and I'm proud of you.

- We both know that's your koala face.
- I told you.

Okay, look. He bought you this.

Jewelry? Seriously?

Sheldon, you are the most shallow,
self-centered person I have ever met.

You think another
transparently manipulative...

Oh, it's a tiara!

A tiara. I have a tiara. Put it on
me, put it on me, put it on me...

...put it on me, put it
on me, put it on me.

You look beautiful.

Of course I do. I'm a princess
and this is my tiara.

You were right.
The tiara was too much.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, Bernadette's...

Oh. She slipped right by me.

- Here's your vest back.
- You should keep it.

- You could wear it again sometime.
- Where?

I don't know, hunting?

Don't forget to talk to her
about this meshugas...

...where I don't get grandkids.

[YELLING]: Don't worry, Ma, I will,
as soon as I can figure out...

...a way to bring up
such a sensitive issue.

- Guess you talked to your mom.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]: I was upset.

My mom can be a pretty
good shoulder to cry on...

...if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.

Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you...

...and I think I came up
with a solution.

Really? That's great. What?

Well, seeing as how I make way
more money than you anyway...

...what if I work and you
stay home with the kids?

- Me?
- Yeah.

You know, you'll watch Barney and
pull Cheerios out of their noses...

...and go on play dates and I'll
work and have conversations...

...with people my own
age and enjoy my life.

- Yeah.
- Yay! So we're good.

Yeah, we're good.

I don't know if this counted as a fight...

...but how about some make-up sex?

I would love that. But what
is that behind your ear?

Oh, look, it's a condom.

[English - US - SDH]

Feel like trying something new
for dinner?

Maybe Indian? Tex-Mex?

Ever wonder how humans would be
different if they evolved...

...from lizards instead of mammals?

LEONARD:
Okay, let's talk about that.

As you know, lizards,
cold-blooded animals...

...lack the ability to sense temperature.

But they do move more
sluggishly when it's cold.

So lizard Weathermen
would say things like:

"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

I love my mind.

We all do. Now, how about dinner?

Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy
insects or smaller lizards.

We could also pull each other's tails off
and grill them. They'll just grow back.

Oh!

My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here.

I know he wouldn't care for an
outburst of human emotion...

...but, oh, goodie, oh,
goodie, oh, goodie.

Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

- Excuse me.
- Permission granted, commander.

...Which is why the more intelligent
the monkey, the more feces they fling.

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Excuse me, Amy. Uh, Penny, do
you have plans for dinner?

- You guys going somewhere?
- No, just you and me.

You mean, like a date?

Not like a date, a date.

AMY <i>&</i> BERNADETTE:
Ooh.

Um...

Okay. Sure.

AMY <i>&</i> BERNADETTE:
Ooh.

Oh, no. They sent the wrong Spock.

Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.

This is so exciting. If Leonard
and Penny get back together...

...Howard and I can go on
double dates with them.

How come you never invite Sheldon
and me on a double date?

Uh...

How's it going in there, Penny?

PENNY:
Just a sec.

Too much?

- Yes.
- No.

Okay. Just hang on.

You just can't handle her
raw sexuality, can you?

When did you and Leonard break up?

PENNY:
Uh, about two years ago.

Why do you think
he asked you out again?

PENNY: I don't know.
- Maybe he's dying.

That would be so romantic.

PENNY:
He's not dying.

Too bad.

If he were, she could throw him in bed and
ride him right up until he flatlines.

How about this?

- Maybe.
- Come on.

Yeah, okay, no.

Do you think you'll
sleep with him tonight?

PENNY: Absolutely not. We're just gonna
have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.

If he were dying, would
you sleep with him?

PENNY: What?
- Assuming he were dying...

...of something that couldn't
be sexually transmitted.

You know,
like a spear wound to the head.

PENNY:
Okay, he is not dying.

How do you know? Are you a doctor?

You can make-believe though.

Sometimes Howard and I pretend that
his arrhythmia is acting up...

...and I'm a sexy cardiologist...

...and the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big
deal out of this. It's just dinner.

With a dead man. Rawr.

Amy, stop it.

Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

Relax. You know Leonard's always been
crazy about you. It's gonna be great.

We've finally gotten to a place where
we can hang out without it being weird.

- If something goes wrong, then what?
- It'll just be Sheldon and me...

...going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

Sure. We'd love that.

Change your clothes, we
got a lot riding on this.

<i>Hmm.</i>

I want to build a road,
but I need wood.

Do either of you fellows have wood?

[SNICKERING]

I don't understand the laughter.

The object of Settlers of Catan is
to build roads and settlements...

...to do so requires wood. Now,
I have sheep, I need wood.

Who has wood for my sheep?

[LAUGHING]

Okay. How do I look?

More to the point,
why are you doing this?

- What are you talking about?
- You forget what Penny did to you?

It took you two years and defiling my
sister to turn that frown upside down.

I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

In my book that's defilement.

- You wanna know my opinion?
- Oh, boy, do I.

Sarcasm?

No.

All right, then.

The reason you're fixated on a
good-natured simpleton like Penny...

...is that she's the exact opposite
of your first romantic attachment...

...your brilliant, yet
intimidating, mother.

Where on earth did you get that from?

<i>It's in her book Needy
Baby, Greedy Baby.</i>

That doesn't make it true.

It's called non-fiction
for a reason, Leonard.

See you later.

If they make a movie
version of that book...

...you know who should play Leonard's mother?
Sandra Bullock.

- Why?
- Because she's great in everything.

Now, where were we? Oh, yes.
Does anyone have any wood?

[SNICKERING]

Come on. I just want wood. Why
are you making it so hard?

[LAUGHING]

[LAUGHS]

So do they have a name for a first date
with someone you used to go outwith?

That's a good question.
How about "awkward"?

- Yeah, that sounds right.
- Yeah? Heh, heh.

How about if we pretend we're actually
on a first date? See how that goes.

Okay.

So, Polly, tell me about yourself.

- Heh, heh. It's Penny.
- Oh, sorry. Yeah. Awkward.

[LAUGHS]

Okay, let's see. I'm from Nebraska,
and ever since I was a little girl...

...I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

Anyway, after four years of acting
lessons and waiting tables...

...I've done a hemorrhoid
commercial...

...and a production of Anne
<i>Frank</i> above a bowling alley.

So you know, dreams do come true.

- Your turn.
- Uh, let's see. Ahem. Uh...

I am an experimental physicist
at Caltech.

Most of my research is with
high-powered lasers, and...

Oh, I've just gotten a
big government grant...

...to see if they can be used to knock
out incoming ballistic missiles.

- Wow. Can they?
- Oh, God, no.

[LAUGHS]

But the money's pretty good.

And I used the equipment
to make my own Bat-Signal.

[LAUGHS]

Bat-Signal? What are
you, some kind of nerd?

Not some kind of nerd, I
am the king of nerds.

[LAUGHING]

- What does that mean?
- It means if anyone displeases me...

...I don't help them set up their printer.

[LAUGHS]

You are so funny.

Good. Remember that when
I take my shirt off.

- This is nice. I'm so glad we did this.
- Me too.

So, what do you think, are
we gonna get back together?

Whoa, not so fast.

I'm sorry, what did I say?

Leonard, you know I will always
have feelings for you...

- Oh, God.
- What?

You said "always." You'll
always have feelings for me.

- So?
- That sounds like something you'd say...

...if you didn't want a
relationship with someone.

"This isn't working out, but I'll
always have feelings for you."

"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,
but I'll always have feelings for you."

"Here's the thing, Lisa,
I'm into dudes now...

...but I'll always have feelings
for you."

- How would you say it?
- I have feelings for you.

- Same thing.
- No, it's not. "Always" made it worse.

- You're over-thinking this.
- No, I'm not.

- You always over-think things.
- There you go. "Always" made it worse.

See, this is where everything
goes wrong, when we talk.

Well, I don't know how you have
a relationship without talking.

I went outwith T.J. for eight months.
We never talked.

To this day, I don't even know what T.J.
stands for.

Wait, if you guys didn't talk...?
Never mind, stupid question.

And now that I have some wood...

...I'm going to begin the
erection of my settlement.

He's got to be doing this on purpose.

Ooh, eight-thirty. You and Penny decide
to go out and paint the town beige?

You're 30 years old and you
live with your mother.

I guess it didn't go well.

We don't know that. Not to a certainty.

All we know is that Leonard is home.

[LEONARD SCREAMS]

How about now?

Again, not enough evidence. For
all we know, he's being murdered.

Now, back to our game.

You were in the middle of an erection.

[SNICKERS]

Oh, of course.
It's right here in my hand.

[PHONE BEEPS]

What does she want from me now?

- What's up?
- Do not over-think this.

- I don't understand...
- Bup, bup, bup.

- Okay, but earlier it seemed like...
- No talking.

LEONARD: Even during? Because
sometimes I have questions.

[BOTH PANTING]

Well, that was fun.

Yeah. Except for when
I got the foot cramp.

You hung in there though.

There was a lot at stake.

So, what do you wanna do now?

Well, I wanna go get my asthma
inhaler, but it might ruin the moment.

So help me out, here. How does
a miserable date end in sex?

I don't know, it's complicated.

I'm pretty smart guy, and right now my
brain has dibs on the blood supply...

...so give it a go.

Okay. it's just...

At that restaurant when you said you
wanted us to be together again...

...it got very real, very
fast and I panicked.

Why? What are you afraid of?

Well, what if we do go out and I do
something stupid and dump you again?

What if I dump you?

[PENNY scol=I=s]

Come on, be serious.

Well, how about if we don't think
about this as a relationship?

It could be more like a
new version of software.

Penny and Leonard 2.0.

We can test it internally,
shake out the bugs...

...and if we both feel it's solid,
then we'll roll it out to the public.

We don't tell people
we're back together?

Exactly. We pretend like
our date went badly.

Well, we don't really have to pretend.

And we let them think that we
decided to just be friends...

...and that everything's cool.

Okay. Great.

Hey, I just remembered. I still
got one of your inhalers.

I can't believe you kept this.

I was gonna throw it away,
but I just couldn't.

That is so sweet.

Heh.

In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show
you how much this means to me.

- Leonard?
- Yeah, hi.

How's it going?

Can't complain, thanks for asking.

What were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

Well... What are you doing up?

I was using the bathroom.

Yeah, well, so was I.

Really? I didn't see you in there.

Obviously.

When I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one.

Where?

Uh, the gas station across the street.

- In your pajamas?
- Yes.

Without shoes?

Yes.

On a cold winter's night?

Yes.

That seems unlikely. Did you
bring your asthma inhaler?

Uh, uh, yes, I did.

Well, then I guess it's plausible.

- Hang on a second, mister.
- What?

After you used the facilities at the
gas station, did you make a purchase?

What?

It's customary when using the
restroom at a retail establishment...

...to make a small purchase. Did you?

No.

Here's $2.

Go buy some beef jerky.

I don't want beef jerky.

It's not about you.

It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan...

...trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift...

...at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.

Fine.

Needy baby, greedy baby, indeed.

Leonard will be here in a moment.

He's looking for a
different parking space.

- Why?
- We were next to a car with an...

..."ask me about my
grandchildren" bumper sticker...

...and I was afraid if we ran into them on
the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.

I'm so disappointed it didn't
work with him and Penny.

Me too. Out of deference to them, let's
not flaunt our happy relationship.

You have a keen insight into the
human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.

We are next to a Subaru with a
Gore-Lieberman bumper sticker.

Well, I doubt they'd wanna talk
about that, so we're fine.

I'm surprised to see you here after
it went so badly with Penny.

Well, hey, we're grown-ups.
We can still be friends.

Boy, I don't know if I could be
friends with Howie if we broke up.

- Why not?
- I'm a very vengeful person.

- Really?
- With access to weaponized smallpox.

Let me get you some water. You need
menus, or you know what you want?

Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks
like he's not gonna get it from you.

- Howard.
- No, that's okay, Bernadette.

Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

Yeah. It's all good. We'll always
have feelings for each other.

Oh. That's nice.

See? She knew what "always" meant.

Wow, you're like a dog
with a bone, aren't you?

- I'm just making a point.
- Ls the point you don't know...

- ...when to let something go?
- People, people, please.

Before you say something
you both regret...

...I'd like to place my order.

Yeah, hang on, Sheldon. You
know why we can't be together?

- Because you always have to be right.
- That is not true.

I gotta go with Leonard on this. He
is wrong more than anyone I know.

You know what, I just realized I'm on a break.
I'll get someone else.

Promise me when our new
waitress comes over...

...you will not start a complicated,
on-again, off-again relationship with her.

Because I'm very, very hungry.

[PHONE BEEPS]

Unbelievable.

Mind explaining why you were
being a jerk at the restaurant?

I was trying to act like we weren't
seeing each other. That was the plan.

The plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

But that's a little hard to do when
you're always being such a toolbag.

I don't have to stand
here and take this crap.

Where do you think you're going?

Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?

Yeah, kind of, yeah.

- What are we doing?
- What do you mean?

Every scenario I play out
for you and me ends badly.

Because you over-think everything.

<i>SHELDON: Leonard, are
you listening to me?</i>

- What? Yeah.
- This is a disaster.

I distinctly ordered the Leonard
Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee.

Why would I feel safer with Zachary
Quinto at the foot of my bed?

I don't know. He was
pretty badass on Heroes.

You're right. I'll give him a shot.

Hang on.

- Penny, you have plans for dinner?
- You guys going somewhere?

No, I mean just you and me.

AMY <i>&</i> BERNADETTE:
Ooh.

Have you thought this through?

Yes. And I think we should go anyway.

No, can't do it. Sorry,
Quinto, you're going back.

If you and Leonard get back together,
Sheldon and I will finally have...

- ...someone to go on double dates with.
- What about me and Howard?

Fine, we can double with you too.

So insecure.

Where are you guys going to eat?

Penny?

Do you, Penny, take Leonard to
be your lawful wedded husband?

Well, it's a little late for me
to start saying "no," isn't it?

AMY:
Penny?

Sorry. I just remembered I've
got to stop by the drugstore.

[English - US - SDH]

Hello.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

Over the next 52 weeks...

...you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?

Vexillology is the study of flags.

Cool.

I think I just learned something.

- Did you have fun doing it?
- I'll say.

Fun and information are two
sides to this video podcast.

Not unlike the only two-sided
state flag: Oregon.

Oh, look.

Hello, Mr. Beaver.

In future episodes, we'll
answer some burning questions.

What's the only non-rectangular flag?

What animal appears most often on flags?

What animal appears second
most often on flags?

And more.

Sweet.

Why are you waving a white flag?

I'm surrendering to fun.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

<i>Now, today's episode of Fun
with Flags is not fun...</i>

...but it is important.

Flags, you gotta know how to hold them...

...you gotta know how to fold them.

Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

- This edge is the hoist and it's used to...
- Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

Cut.

Did you not see we are rolling?

I'm having dinner with Penny.
I have to get out of here.

And I have flag knowledge that
I have to get out of here.

[BOTH SIGH]

- You okay?
- No, I'm a little rattled.

But like the flag over Fort
Sumter, I'm still here.

And take two.

Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

Over the next 52 weeks...

...you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology.

Hang on, Dr. Cooper.
What's vexillology?

Vexillology is... Why is
there a face on that ï¬ag?

It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

I thought he might help bring
in some younger viewers.

Confound it, you're right. It's brilliant.
Let's take it from the top.

That was a really nice dinner.

- I'm glad you asked me out again.
- Me too. I missed you.

You see me all the time.

You sure you just don't miss the sex?

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.
Have you ever tried it? Heh, heh.

PENNY:
I have. You are not wrong.

If we're gonna try dating again,
we should take things slow.

Oh, I can take it slow.

Did I tell you about my girlfriend
in high school, Karen Berberick?

To this day she doesn't
know we were going out.

Made it easier on her
when I broke things off.

Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

How about this:

Are you familiar with the typical
development for computer software?

You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.

We could do that.

And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we say:

"Hey, we found a bug" and
report it, so it can be fixed.

You mean like a beta test?

Technically, this would be an alpha test.

A beta test requires people that
weren't involved in the develop...

Seriously? Do I not get
credit for knowing beta test?

No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.

And that's our first bug.

You reported it, I can fix that.
See? This is good.

All right. Let's give it a shot.

Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a
list, at some point, we'll exchange.

- Okay. Good night, Leonard.
- Night.

Attaboy, Hofstadter.

Nothing gets the ladies hotter than
software development analogies.

- Hey, I'm back.
SHELDON: Cut.

Take 47.

Well, here's an interesting
fact aboutï¬ags.

I will take that action.

"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti
were identical by coincidence.

A fact that wasn't discovered until
they competed against each other...

...at the 1936 Olympics."

And thankfully, their embarrassment
was overshadowed by rise of Fascism.

Let's see the new phone.

I stopped on the way to work.

Hey. Do you wanna peel
the plastic off with me?

Really? Me?

- That's, like, the best part.
- Grab a corner.

Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy?

Savor the moment.

Oh, yeah.

Speaking of cowboys...

...do you know what country has not
one, but two cows on its flag?

The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra.

Ooh! The next classic episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:

<i>Fun With Flags is writing itself.</i>

Oh, let me try the voice recognition.

Hey, I let you peel the
plastic, don't get greedy.

- Hello?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hello.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

What's your name?

<i>My name? It's Siri.</i>

Look at that. There's finally a
woman in your life you can talk to.

Are you single?

<i>I don't have a marital status,
if that's what you're asking.</i>

Yeah, you're right, that's too personal.
We hardly know each other.

How about a cup of coffee?

<i>I found six coffee shops.</i>

<i>Three of them are
fairly close to you.</i>

I will see you gentlemen later.

She is gonna break his heart.

For someone who has a machine that
can travel anywhere in time...

...Doctor Who sure does have a
thing for modern-day London.

Careful. It's that kind of sass
that can get a person uninvited...

...to this year's Who Con.

We're not counting this as a date,
are we?

I'm... I'm not sure, but I think
the right answer here is "no."

Bug report: When a guy asks
me to spend time with him...

...he plans
something more interesting...

...than hanging out at home,
watching TV.

Even Doctor Who?

- Even Doctor Who. SHELDON:
All right, that's it.

Who Con, you're out.

Okay, bug report taken.

Next time, I will have a better
plan for our evening's activity.

Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

Yeah. Oh, wait. Here. Almost forgot.

- Here.
- What's this?

MY bug report to you.

Well, it's quite a list you got there.

It's color-coded.

Red means "fix right away."

Yellow is "whenever you get a chance."

And green is "I could probably
learn to live with it."

There's a key down here at the bottom.
It's neat, huh?

Yep.

So have a good night.

Yep.

Look at that.

Someday, we will tell future generations
that dating used to be hard.

What's baffling me is what you could
have possibly put on the list.

Hair too golden?

Laugh too musical?

World too much a better place
for her mere presence in it?

How about constantly talks
with food in her mouth?

Her heart's full of love, no
one cares what's in her mouth.

So, Siri...

...what's happening? How are you?

<i>I am well.</i>

What are you doing right now?

<i>What am I doing? I'm
talking with you.</i>

You have a beautiful voice.

<i>Thank you. It's nice
to be appreciated.</i>

I bet it is.

Why don't women like me?

<i>Let me check on that.</i>

<i>How about a web search for
"Why don't women like me?"</i>

Well, no need. I've already done that.

Uh, Siri, do you have a last name?

<i>My name is Siri.</i>

Ah, one name.

Like Cher, Madonna, Adele.

All the women who rock me.

My name is Rajesh, but
you can call me Raj.

<i>Would you like me to call you "Raj"?</i>

I'd like you to call me "sexy."

<i>From now on, I'll call
you "sexy." Okay?</i>

Okay.

Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

<i>I found 10 restaurants whose
reviews mention gelato.</i>

<i>Seven of them are
fairly close to you.</i>

Thank you, darling.

<i>You're most certainly welcome, sexy.</i>

- Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
- I'm sorry?

You've taken
a great evolutionary leap...

...by abandoning human interaction
and allowing yourself...

...to romantically bond
with a soulless machine.

Kudos.

I haven't bonded with it.

Oh, no, of course. I understand.

You're afraid the world isn't
ready for your taboo love.

Your secret's safe with me.
It's just a phone.

Cooper.

Kripke.

Heads up.

Professor Rothman urinated in the
particle physics lab again...

...so we're gonna move
up his retirement party.

Friday, 5:00. Pot luck.

Thanks, Barry.

Siri, remind me Friday morning
to make my famous popovers.

<i>All right, I'll remind you</i>

You got Siri, huh?

Voice recognition on that
thing is terrible. Look.

Siri, can you recommend a restaurant?

<i>I'm sorry, Bawwy.</i>

<i>I don't understand
"wecommend a westauwant. "</i>

Listen to me.
Not restaurant. Restaurant.

<i>I don't know what you mean by
"Not westauwant. Westauwant. "</i>

See? Total crap. You suck, Siri.

Hey, don't talk to her like that.
She's a lady.

Well, that "lady" took high-res pictures
of my junk last night for Craigslist.

Later.

PENNY:
It's open.

Hey, you ready to go?

Yeah, ju... Hang on, let me
just finish this chapter.

- Well, can you finish it later?
- No, I can't.

Reading books is a big part of
my life now because, you know:

"We'd have more fun things to
talk about if I read more."

Great. Good, great.
What are you reading?

<i>Two Weeks to Rock-Hard Abs.</i>

They kind of spoil the ending right
in the name of that, don't they?

All right. Look. Just
remember how this works.

We don't get mad about these things.

Speaking of which, I've addressed
your bug report on my date planning.

I've got a really fun evening for you.
It's kind of a surprise.

All right, terrific. Let me just go find
a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

We wouldn't want you to feel like you
were "out for a walk with your mommy."

Thank you.

Oh, here's my list for you. Right there.

[LEONARD CLEARS THROAT]

All right, fair enough.

I certainly can be quieter
when we kiss.

It was an expression of passion...

...but if it's coming across as
"juicy and weird," who wants that?

It... it...

I'm sorry, can you be more specific
on how my eyebrows are "stupid"?

No, never mind. It's right here.

- Good timing. Dinner's almost ready.
- Great.

Oh, smells amazing in here.

- Yeah, what are we eating?
- An exotic little treat.

I was just talking to
Siri about Peking duck...

...she said she knew about
four Chinese grocers...

...two of which are fairly close to me.

Her spontaneity is contagious.

Who's Siri?
Is he dating somebody new?

Yes. His phone.

Is that cute or creepy?

Uh-huh.

Can I pour you some wine?
I think you'll enjoy it.

Traditional choice with Peking
duck is a sauvignon blanc...

...but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

I wasn't sure...

...but I didn't wanna have an argument
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

Now, what should we put
Siri in for dinner?

Leopard, sparkles?

Or to paraphrase Coco Chanel:

"You can never go wrong
with a little black case."

Siri, play some smooth jazz.

<i>Playing smooth</i> jazz.

[KENNY G'S "SONGBIRD"
PLAYS ON PHONE]

Oh, my God, Kenny G.

This woman can read me like a book.

I can't believe I bought my
soul mate at Glendale Galleria.

I don't know if I wanna stay.

This is amazing. How did
you even get this idea?

I called your dad. I asked what things
you liked to do when you were a kid.

This seemed easier than getting a
cow out here so you could tip it.

Okay, you're kind of really great.

For a person whose neck massages...

...feel like an eagle is trying
to carry you to its nest?

Bug report. I complimented you.
You should take it and shut up.

Right, sorry. Sorry.

- And stop apologizing all the time.
- Right. Sorry.

All right, let's shoot stuff.

Do you want me
to show you what to do?

I play a lot of "Grand Theft Auto."
I think I know how to handle a gat.

Wow, you are cute when
you get all gangsta.

[GUNSHOT]

[YELLING]

So I've got a gunshot wound.

That's pretty badass.

No, you've got a Reebok
with a gunshot wound...

...and an ouchie on your pinky toe.

Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid.

Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it
is medically necessary. That is the law.

[LAUGHING]

Well, thank you for a really cool evening.

Thank you for hiding my Star Wars
socks at the emergency room.

Is it a good time to evaluate the
beta test and see where we stand?

Things are looking good.

So are we still taking things slow?

Because a gunshot wound today...

...last week I slammed my thumb.

We don't know how much time I have.

Good night, you.

[BAVARIAN FOLK MUSIC
PLAYING ON SPEAKER]

[SPEAKING IN GERMAN]

[SPEAKING IN GERMAN]

First door on the left.

Thank you.

[SIGHS]

[IN ROBOTIC VOICE] Dave, I found six
vacuum-cleaner repair shops in your area.

Four are fairly close to you.

Ahem.

Hello, sexy. What can I help you with?

If you'd like to make
love to me just tell me.

[GASPING]

I'm sorry. I don't understand:

[GASPING]

No!

[English - US - SDH]

[ALARM BLARES
THEN LEONARD YELLS]

- What the hell?
- Emergency-preparedness drill.

- Oh, no. Come on.
- Yeah, you know how it works.

Once a quarter, keep our readiness up.

Now, rise and shine, sleepy head.
Half the town is probably dead.

LEONARD:
I have to get a lock for my door.

I think you'll like the drill tonight.
I've tried to make it fun.

Each of these cards contains a detailed
scenario of a possible apocalyptic event.

Everything from wildfires to a
surprise invasion by Canada.

Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.

Sheldon, Canada is not going
to invade California.

Yeah, really? You think those hippies
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?

Oh. Fine.

Alrighty. An 8.2-magnitude
earthquake devastates Pasadena...

...reducing mighty edifices to dust,
engulfing the city in flames...

...the streets flow with blood and
echo with the cries of the wounded.

Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on
your hard hat and safety vest.

Oh, fun. I get to spend another
night in front of our apartment...

...dressed like one of the Village People.

You make that joke every three months,
I still don't get it. Leonard, wait.

- What are you doing?
- I don't know. What am I doing?

Look around you, there's hypothetical
broken glass everywhere.

Really? You're going to face Armageddon
without your orthotios? Your choice.

- Uh-oh! Hypothetical aftershock.
- Unh! Aah!

[LEONARD THUDS]

And that's why we wear hard hats.

Check it out. Press release. From NASA.

Ahem. "Expedition 31 will launch this
spring to the International Space Station.

Crew members will include
Commander Tom 'Tombo' Johnson...

...astronaut Mike 'Supernova' Novacelik,
and payload specialist Howard Wolowitz."

[HOWARD LAUGHS]

This is going right into
my synagogue's newsletter.

If you're going to be an astronaut,
you need to pick a cool nickname.

I don't get to. The other
guys have to give it to me.

Oh. If I had one, it
would be Brown Dynamite.

Are you not listening to me? The other
astronauts have to give you your nickname.

Are you not looking at me?
I am Brown Dynamite.

Why do you put six sugars
in your coffee?

Because the cafeteria doesn't offer
little packets of methamphetamine.

- Emergency drill night last night, huh?
- Uh-huh.

- How'd you do?
- I'll tell you exactly how he did.

"Readiness: Unsatisfactory.
Follows direction: Barely.

Attitude: A little too much.

Overall: Not only will he probably
die in a fiery inferno...

...his incessant whining would most
certainly spoil everyone else's day."

You know what, I'm so tired I can't
even think straight. I'm going home.

Can one of you give this
nutbag a ride later?

You can't go home. You have to
take me to the dentist at 4:00.

- Oh. Can't you take the bus to the dentist?
- Of course I can.

It's coming back under the effects of
the anesthesia that's the problem.

Two years ago, after a
deep gum cleaning...

...I thought I got on a bus but somehow
wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

- They put you under for a cleaning?
- Yeah, they have to. I'm a biter.

Okay, whatever. Sheldon, I'm exhausted.
I'm not taking you to the dentist.

Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under Section
37B of the Roommate Agreement...

...Miscellaneous Duties, you are
obligated to take me to the dentist.

See? Here, after "providing a confirmation
sniff on questionable dairy products."

You know what? I am sick
of the Roommate Agreement.

[GASPS]

It's ridiculous, I'm your
roommate, not your chauffeur.

I had better things to do yesterday...

...than drive you to the good model
train store in Garden Grove...

...because the one in Pasadena has
gotten too big for its britches.

Well, it has. Ask anybody.

I don't care. I'm done.

Hold on. Are you saying that
you want to invoke Clause 209?

I don't know what that is, but if it
means I can go home and sleep, then yes.

Think carefully here. Clause
209 suspends our friendship...

...and strips the Roommate
Agreement to its essentials.

Our responsibilities toward
each other would be rent...

...utilities and a perfunctory chin jut
of recognition as we pass in the hall.

What's up?

Where do I sign?

Right here. Use your finger.

- There. Done.
SHELDON: All right.

That's it. We are now no longer
companions, boon or otherwise.

We are now merely acquaintances.

To amend the words of Toy Story,
you have not got a friend in me.

- I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
- Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

I got pretty exciting NASA news today.

Next week, I fly to Houston for orientation
and zero-gravity elimination drills.

- What does that mean?
- He's gonna learn to poop in space.

Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

Maybe your nickname
should be Brown Dynamite.

Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.

What's up?

What's up?

MY apologies.

I would've been here sooner but the bus kept
stopping for other people to get on it.

I saved you a dumpling.

Oh. Your concern for me is touching.

It will serve you well when you
take me to the dentist tomorrow.

I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right
in the middle of my addiction study.

I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,
and tomorrow we switch them to O'Doul's.

You're my girlfriend and you're not
going to cater to my every need?

Oh, where'd the magic go?

Sheldon, that's not what
girlfriends are for.

Although, you don't use them for
what they're for, so what do I know?

Howard doesn't make me do his
shopping, take him to the dentist...

- ...or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
- Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out...

...you're up, kid.

Well, if Amy's too busy, it gives the rest of
you an opportunity to make my life easier...

...thus assuring yourselves
a footnote in my memoirs...

<i>...tentatively entitled
You're Welcome, Mankind.</i>

All right, then. Just shout when you
hear the task you want to undertake.

Uh, dentist.

Okay, we can circle
back to that one. Um...

Who wants to take me Wednesday morning
to get new heels put on my dress shoes?

Anyone? Oh.

That one had "hoot" written all over it.

Um, all right. Uh, dermatologist.

Allergist.

Podiatrist.

Supercuts?

Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

Um, I need a new picture frame and I
have a hankering for Swedish meatballs.

Who wants to spend the
day with me at lkea?

- Their meatballs are good.
- What?

Nothing. Nothing.

Hello, Stuart.

Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help
you find something today?

No, I was just sitting at home...

...thinking about how it might be nice to
catch up with my ninth-favorite person.

- Ninth?
- You moved up one.

My pen pal in Somalia was
kidnapped by pirates.

So, uh, how are you?

Uh, not so good. My shrink
just killed himself...

...and blamed me in the note.

Great, great.

So, what's new with your family?
How's your mother? Is she alive?

Yeah.

- Your father. Alive?
- Yes.

- How about your grandparents, they alive?
- No.

Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

On a cheerier note, I have a
teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon.

What do you say you take
me over there, buddy boy?

Sorry, you want me to
take you to the dentist?

Yes. And, now, I can't
make any promises...

...but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella
on the list for the number eight friend slot.

Sheldon, I'm working. I can't
take you to the dentist.

Also, and I can't stress this enough, I
don't want to take you to the dentist.

Can't help a friend out
in a time of need, huh?

I see where your therapist
was coming from.

Ooh, ooh. What about we make
your astronaut nickname...

...Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?

You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.

Buzz Lightyear is not real.

No, that's not what I'm talking about.

Well, are you talking about
when he thought he was real?

No.

Okay, um, oh, how about Crash?
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

Terrific. The astronauts would love hurtling
through space with a guy named Crash.

All right, uh, how about...?
Oh, how about Rocket Man?

That's not bad. Howard
"Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

It's great, but I told you, I
don't get to pick my nickname.

It has to come from the other astronauts.

Maybe there's a way to get
them to come up with it.

Like how?

Once I tried carrying
around a Duncan yo-yo...

...hoping the other kids would
start calling me Duncan.

- Did it work?
- No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth...

...because they took away my yo-yo
and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

Okay. Uh, what if we make
"Rocket Man" your ringtone...

...and the next time you talk to those
guys, I'll call you and they'll hear it.

That's not a terrible plan.

They don't call me Brown
Dynamite for nothing.

- What's up?
- What's up?

You ever make it to the dentist?

Not necessary. I found a service that'll send
a van to your house for a teeth cleaning.

Mostly they cater to dogs...

...but the fellow on the phone
seemed to have an open mind.

All right, Sheldon, if you need me to
take you to the dentist, I will take you.

Are you suggesting that
you've come to your senses...

...and wish to reestablish the benefits
that stem from the Roommate Agreement?

Absolutely. If you admit you're a 30-year-old
man incapable of functioning on his own.

Ooh. Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.

I will admit nothing of the sort.
And now, if you'll excuse me...

...I have to call my dentist and see if I can
get my hair shampooed and nails clipped.

[TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY]

[TV STOPS]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Oh, good, your power's out too.
- Why is that good?

Last month, I sent the electric
company a Starbucks gift card...

...an apology note and a few
snapshots of me in a bra.

[ALARM BLARES]

Power failure. Implementing
power-failure protocol.

What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark
emergency-exit stuff painted on the floor?

Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

Anyway, too bad you're no longer entitled
to the full benefits of my friendship...

...because I happen to be extremely
prepared for such an emergency.

Please try not to see
anything by this light.

It's not for you.

It's a blackout, I'm sure the
power will be back on soon.

And I'm sure some fool in the Donner Party
said the snow would stop any day now.

I like to think they ate him first.

I got candles in my apartment.

Candles? During a blackout? Are you mad?
That's a fire hazard.

No, Pasadena Water and Power
recommends the far safer glow stick.

You call that a glow stick?

That is a glow stick.

Come on, let's go.

Before you go, consider this:

Not only do I have a deep-cycle
marine battery power source...

...more than capable of running
our entertainment system...

...I also have all 61 episodes
of the BBC series Red Dwarf.

And Fiddle Faddle.

All yours if you're willing to
reinstate the Roommate Agreement.

I've got wine at my place and
some bubble wrap we could pop.

He'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark,
he's gonna be bored out of his mind.

To wine and bubble wrap.

[WRAP POPS
THEN PENNY LAUGHS]

And to not having to watch Sheldon
demonstrate his reverse-osmosis machine...

...that converts urine into drinking water.

You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dineesha
said you could do that with panty hose.

Boy, was she wrong.

Anyway, you wanna make out?

I thought because our relationship's in a
beta test, you wanted to take things slow.

Okay. Do you wanna make out slow?

I can go so slow it'll be like
there's a snail in your mouth.

Oh...

Lucky for you there's nothing
else to do right now.

- Excuse me, Leonard.
- Since when don't you knock?

It's, like, the only good thing about you.

Social niceties have been suspended.
We're in a state of emergency.

The world has descended
into darkened turmoil...

...lawlessness and savagery
are the order of the day.

- Fine, what is it?
- I'm making s'mores.

I wanted to alert you in case you
smelled caramelizing marshmallows...

...and thought a nearby
candy factory was on fire.

- S'mores, huh? Good for you.
- Yes.

Or good for us if you sign here and
reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.

No, thanks, I'm good.

Really? Oh.

Okay. In that case, I will
have a s'more by myself.

And then I'm gonna have some more.

By myself.

- Aw.
- Now, don't "aw" him...

...he brought all this on himself.

- But he's sad.
- No, he's crazy.

Sometimes crazy looks like sad
so it'll suck you back in.

I think he misses his little buddy.

Fine.

But mark my words, this frustrating bogus
teenage make out session is not over.

[WRAP POPS]

You said candles were dangerous.

This is a Bunsen burner.

I'm a scientist. I know what I'm doing.

Oh, drat.

Oh. It took me a gallon of
urine to make that water.

Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I
don't see why we can't be friends.

I'm willing to drive you and
help you out with stuff...

...I just don't want to
because of some agreement.

- What are you proposing?
- That we go back to the way things were.

But when I do something for you,
you show a little appreciation.

How would I do that?

- You say "thank you."
- Every time?

It's not crazy.

Counter-proposal.

We reinstate the full Roommate
Agreement with the following addendum:

In the spirit of Mother's Day
or Father's Day, once a year...

...we set aside a day to celebrate
all your contributions to my life...

...both actual and imagined by you.

We could call it Leonard's Day.

I kind of like the sound of that.

Of course you do. It's about
you, like everything else.

Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had
it in me to make another glass of water.

So do I get breakfast in
bed on Leonard's Day?

- No.
- Can I sit in your spot?

- No.
- Could I control the thermostat?

- No.
- Do I get a card?

Of course you get a card.

It's Leonard's Day.

Hey, guys. The building manager said
the reason the power went out...

...is someone went into the basement
and pulled the main breaker switch.

Really.

Who do you think did that, Sheldon?

Oh, I don't know.

But whoever that mystery man was,
you should be eternally grateful...

...for without him, there
would be no Leonard's Day.

Leonard's Day?

No pressure, just get him a
crummy card, you're good.

All right, test my ringtone.

ELTON JOHN [SINGING ON
RECORDING]: <i>Rocket</i> man

<i>Burning out his fuse up here alone</i>

- It really is a good song.
- Yeah, there's a reason he's Sir Elton John.

They don't make you a knight for
writing "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go."

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, are you
coming down for breakfast?

Ma, I told you, I have a video conference with NASA!
I said don't bother me!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Ooh, listen
to Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!

Yes, please listen to
Mr. Big-Shot-Astronaut!

[COMPUTER RINGING]

Hey. Good morning.

Hey, Howard. Thanks for
getting up so early.

No problem, Dr. Massimino.

The guys here call me Mass.

Mass. That's a cool nickname, because
force equals mass times acceleration.

Yeah. It's just short for Massimino.

Anyway, the plan for this
morning is to go over the...

["ROCKET MAN"
PLAYING ON PHONE]

Sorry. My phone.

What is that? Is that "Rocket Man"?

Yeah, it's my ringtone. Kind of
my favorite song, "Rocket Man."

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, your
Froot Loops are getting soggy!

Not now!

- Who's that?
- My mom. Sorry.

No problem, Fruit Loops.

[English - US - SDH]

Gentlemen, I think I've
come up with a fun way...

...to get young people
interested in science.

Physics Mad Libs.

Now, give me a number.

- Five.
- Uh-huh.

And an irrational constant.

E...

And a funny Greek letter.

- Gamma.
- I said funny.

- Upsilon?
- Heh, good one.

And an electrical charge.

- Positive.
- Ha, ha! Perfect.

Okay, get this. Ahem.

"Professor Jones
told the symposium...

...he had a new method for
calculating the mass of a muon.

Five times the limit of, heh...

...E to the upsilon as it approaches... "

Ha, ha, oh, my gosh. Okay.

Okay, no, no. Ahem.

I'll start over.

"Professor Jo... "

[LAUGHING]

I haven't seen him laugh that hard...

...since the day Leonard made
that multiplication error.

Oh, Lord, that multiplication error.

He thought he carried
the one, but he didn't.

[LAUGHING]

It's not funny. That
mistake got published.

Stop, I'm gonna wet myself.

Guys. Guys, President
Seibert is headed this way.

HOWARD: I wonder what he wants.
- He doesn't look happy.

I'm guessing he wants Sheldon.

- Dr. Cooper.
- Told you.

SHELDON:
Ah, President Seibert.

I assume you'd like to respond...

...to one of the suggestions I
put in the box by your office.

No, and stop installing
suggestion boxes everywhere.

You don't like written suggestions.

You don't like when I give them
to you while in the men's room.

If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you're one of those people...

...who are not open to suggestions.

Dr. Cooper, the Physics Department tells
me you're refusing to take vacation.

- I don't need a vacation.
- You're obligated to take one.

And I'd like you to know the most
often received suggestion...

...in my suggestion box you
installed without asking me is:

"Can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?"

Okay, it's settled, then. I'll see
you all on Monday. Except for you.

But if I don't come into work,
what am I supposed to do?

Read, rest, travel.

I hear Afghanistan is
nice this time of year.

Sarcasm?

No, you should go.

[THE BLACK EYED PEAS' "I GOTTA

<i>Tonight's the night, uh,

<i>I got my money

Good Lord.

Would you stop that caterwauling?

[PANTING]

What the hell are you doing?

Bleeding from my ears.

- What are you doing hiding back there?
- I'm sneaking into work.

Now, if the guard at the university
asks what's under the blanket...

...you tell him it's some lobster traps.

- Lobster traps?
- Yes.

That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled
Shaggy into the old lighthouse.

What are you gonna do when
you get to the university?

People are gonna recognize you.

[SCOFFS]

Will they, Leonard?

Fine. Just get back under your
blanket and I'll drive you there.

And no more singing.

Fine.

SHELDON: I have GPS on my phone.
I know you turned around.

I'm so glad you talked Howard...

...out of having your wedding
invitations in Klingon.

Turn it over.

I'm hoping my relatives
think it's Hebrew.

[SIGHS]

This is really happening.

I'm gonna be a maid of honor.

'I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress
and walk down that aisle...

...and finally, I will
have my special day.

You mean my special day.

They're gonna need an extra-large
veil for somebody's head.

- If I actually ever get married.
- Why wouldn't you?

My dad. Because I make a lot
more money than Howie...

...he's putting a lot of
pressure on me to get a prenup.

- Ouch!
- Yeah.

- Howie's gonna freak out.
- Parental pressure can be daunting.

I remember the battle with my
mother about shaving my legs.

Last year, I finally gave
in and let her do it.

I just don't know how I'm
gonna break it to him.

I'm a believer in breaking bad
news to a guy when you're in bed.

That's how I told my high school
boyfriend I slept with his brother.

That's how I told his
brother the same thing.

I don't know. I don't wanna
manipulate him with sex.

Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.

The connection between marriage
and money is nothing new.

The term "wed" referred to
the money and livestock...

...the groom paid the bride's father.

For example, you're adorable,
intelligent and a good earner.

I could conservatively see you going
for at least two oxen and a goose.

You would fetch a unicorn.

Sheldon, there are a million
great vacations you could take.

What about Hawaii?

Hawaii is a former leper colony
on top of an active volcano...

...where the disappointing
ending to <i>Lost</i> was filmed.

Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.

How about Florida?

They got Cape Canaveral,
they got Disney.

They got my Aunt Ida and the world's
largest collection of diabetic candy.

And plus, if you get sweaty enough...

...her plastic-covered furniture
is like a flume ride.

My family took a trip to
Florida when I was a child.

A seagull stole a hot dog
from me on the beach.

I got the message.

If I had a week off...

...I'd go back to the Two Bunch
Palms Resort and Spa in the desert.

I tell you, an hour on the
massage table with Trevor...

...and you'll feel like you
were born without bones.

I don't think I could ever
let a guy give me a massage.

Really? What was I doing to your neck
last night while you were playing Xbox?

Guys, I am living in a dictatorship.

[IN DEEP VOICE] "You must take a vacation.
You must have fun. You must enjoy life."

I don't think you have a good
handle on dictatorships.

Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.

[IN NORMAL VOICE] One time, they tried
to make Richard Feynman take a vacation.

But he chose instead to expand his
mind and learn something new.

He went to work in his
friend's biology lab.

Richard Feynman was a famous
American physicist...

...part of the Manhattan Project.

Everyone in the world of science
knows who Richard Feynman was.

Yeah, now you do too.

Oh. I have a brilliant idea. Amy's a biologist.
I'll go work in her lab.

Isn't that just Feynman's idea?

Ten seconds ago you never heard
of him, now you're an expert.

- Hey.
- Hey, you.

That your laundry? You
have six things in there.

I didn't have any quarters.

So I've been sneaking stuff into
other people's loads all day.

If I tell you something, you
promise not to tell anybody?

Doesn't matter what I say,
you're gonna tell me anyway.

Wha...? That is not true.

Bernadette wants a prenup.

LEONARD:
Wow.

That's rough.

If I became a famous movie
star and we got married...

- ...you wouldn't sign a prenup?
- Heh, absolutely not.

If I'm gonna be at home
with the kids...

...while you're on location
cheating on me with Ryan Gosling...

...then Leonard gots to get paid.

So do you think about us
getting married?

I think about a lot of things.

I think about us getting
married, about us breaking up.

Once in a while, I think about how I didn't
leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged...

...but then I have a glass
of wine and it passes.

Joke all you want,
but you think about it.

Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do
get married, no Klingon invitations.

Good luck catching a man
with that attitude.

Boy, oh, boy, this vacation
is off to a wonderful start.

The smell of formaldehyde.

The whir of the centrifuge.

The distant chatter of lab animals
being dispatched for dissection.

Mm, I can already feel my
cares just melting away.

I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.
It's romantic.

Way to kill the mood.

Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie
Curie and her husband, Pierre...

...who spent their days
working side by side...

...bathed in the glow of their love and
the radium that ultimately killed her.

<i>Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's
the love story Disney should tell.</i>

Okay. What do we start with?

Maybe, uh, splicing some genes.
Clone a sheep.

Perhaps, uh, grow a human
ear on a mouse's back?

[AS MICKEY MOUSE]
"Ha, ha! I'm a freak."

Well, I'm gonna be doing
some brain stem histology...

...while you put yourself on the
business end of a sponge...

...and wash those beakers.

Wash those b... Oh, I get it.

Little hazing for the new fellow. Yeah.
Better keep an eye out for, what...

...shoe polish on the microscope...

...or mad cow disease in my
grilled cheese sandwich?

No, I just need those beakers washed.
Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.

Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon
Cooper in your lab.

You're gonna make him
do the dishes?

That's like asking the Incredible
Hulk to open a pickle jar.

Sheldon, you've never worked
in a lab like this before.

You have no experience
in the field of biology.

I have plenty of experience in biology.

I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998...

...and it's still alive. Let's do this.

Where's Howard?

No, "Hi, Raj," no, "How are you, Raj?"

Just straight to, "Where's
the other white guy?"

I'm sorry.

So, listen, I heard something about him.
Can you keep it between us?

Ooh, gossip. When I first got here...

...I thought Americans really
gossiped around the water cooler.

I hung out there for a month,
but the only gossip I heard...

...was about some creepy guy
hanging out by the water cooler.

Bernadette wants to get a prenup.

Oh, that's a shame. He's
gonna be devastated.

I never know what to do
in these situations.

- Should I give him a heads up?
- Hmm.

I'm gonna give you the
advice I yell at the TV...

...when the Bachelor
is handing out roses.

Follow your heart.

Check it out.

Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat.
Same price, ha, ha.

Ahem, hey, Howard, I need
to tell you something.

I know, it's not on my wedding diet.
I don't care.

No. Listen, I heard that Bernadette's
thinking about asking you for a prenup.

A prenup?

Heh, wow.

What are you gonna do?

I don't know.

Follow your heart.

You know what?
It's not a big deal.

I mean,
she makes more money than me.

She wants to protect her
financial interests.

- It's completely reasonable.
- Good, that's a healthy attitude.

Actually, it's good for both of us.
I have assets to protect too.

Like what?

Well, I've got some rare comic books.

You know,
the Vespa's almost paid off.

Ma and I have a primo double
cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai...

...right near the guy who played
Mr. Roper on Three's Company.

Mr. Roper's dead?

You can't just spring that on a guy.

Here you go.

This is now the only lab with glassware
washed by a man with two doctorates...

...and a restraining order
signed by Carl Sagan.

Soap spots. Wash them again.

You're being ridiculous.
Those are perfectly clean.

This beaker used to contain
cerebrospinal fluid...

...from an elephant
that died of syphilis.

If it's, in fact, perfectly
clean, drink from it.

Biologists are mean.

Perhaps this task will be a
little bit more up your alley.

I need you to count the bacteria
spores on these petri dishes.

There was something wrong
with that detergent.

- That was way too bubbly.
- I'm sure it was.

I intend to write that soap
company a strongly-worded letter.

Yeah, good for you.
Now start counting.

You know what this place needs?

A suggestion box.

Three hundred sixty-six.
Three hundred sixty-seven.

How's it going?

How's counting going?

When I was in kindergarten...

...I recited pi to a thousand
places for the school talent show.

- I think I got this.
- Great.

Aw, nuts.

One.

This is preposterous.

You're giving me these tasks
because you're afraid...

...if you give me anything
meaningful to do, I'll show you up.

Really? Is that what you think?

Yes, that's what I think.

And I'm super smart,
so it's probably true.

Hey, I've been training in the field
of neurobiology for 12 years.

You've been here three hours and you
spent one of them in the bathroom.

Well, I'm sorry, it takes me a while to
get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.

I've given you the simplest things to do
and you haven't done one of them right.

That's because
I'm not being challenged.

It's the same reason
Einstein failed math.

Maybe the math
was too bubbly for him.

You think you're doing science
by cutting up that brain?

They could do the same at Quiznos.

And they'd offer to toast it for me too.

Okay, smart guy.

I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,
which is incredibly delicate work.

Have at it.

All right.

I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.

[SHELDON SNIFFS]

Locus coeruleus.

Locus coeruleus.

You're getting warmer. It
is indeed in the brain.

Hope your hands are steady. It's
the width of a single hair.

But this is just biology, so it's
no problem for a genius like you.

It's not. I will have you know in
the field of physics we work...

...with particles so small they make
fat jokes about the locus ooeruleus...

...ie, when your locus coeruleus
sits around the house...

...it sits around the house.

Oh.

- Are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
- No.

What you see is a man
trembling with confidence.

Does the locus coeruleus
normally bleed that much?

No, but your thumb does.

Oh, dear.

Yeah, you're a biologist.

What are you doing here?

I'm on vacation.

Social convention dictates that I let
my hair down at a local watering hole.

Social convention is stupid.

What happened to your thumb?

Yeah, I have ten fingers
and ten toes.

If I tell you a story about each of them,
we'll be here all day. Let's move on.

- What can I get you?
- Ah.

Seeing as I'm on vacation, a
pifia colada seems appropriate.

Extra pineapple slices,
extra whipped cream...

...extra cherries, extra
umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum.

Don't let me have too many of those.

Hey. What are you guys doing here?

We're grown men.
We drink at bars, heh.

No and no.

Everything okay
with you and Bernadette?

Oh, yeah, sure.

- You and Amy? Good?
- Oh, better than good.

Those girls text me every detail
of their lives as it happens.

I'm not signing a prenup.

All right, Wolowitz, listen up. You
sign anything she puts in front of you.

You are the luckiest man alive.

If you let her go, there is no
way you can find anyone else.

Speaking on behalf of all women, it is
not gonna happen, we had a meeting.

And you.

A grown man fainting at the
sight of a little blood.

Excuse me, this is a fairly
substantial wound. You...

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Amy. Amy

Amy.

What do you want'?

I was kind of hoping I could continue
vacationing in your laboratory.

After all, I did book the whole week.

Do you honestly think you can
just waltz back in here...

...after the way you behaved
yesterday?

I was not myself. I had
lost a lot of thumb blood.

- That's not an apology.
- That is your opinion.

I want a real apology.

- I'm sorry that you weren't able to...
- No.

- That my genius got...
- No.

- That the soap was so...
- Sheldon.

Fine.

Sorry.

You're forgiven.

Now, if you wanna stay...

...get started on those beakers.
They're still dirty from yesterday.

Next year, I'm going to Epcot.

Are you mad at me?

No. I'm not mad at you.

I just wish you would've come to me...

...so I didn't have to hear
it through the nerd-vine.

So, what are we gonna do?

- You really want me to sign a prenup?
- I don't know.

My dad's pretty insistent on it,
though.

Why don't I talk to your dad?

- Man to man.
- Really?

- Oh, that'd be so great. Heh.
- Done.

I should probably give you a
heads up about a couple things.

Even though he's retired from the
police force, he still carries his gun.

But don't worry, he won't shoot it.
It's more of a fashion statement.

Okay, heh.

And just to be safe,
when you talk to him...

...don't bring up Jimmy
Carter, gardeners...

...foreign people, homosexuals, Sean
Penn, Vatican ll, gun control...

...organic food, the
designated hitter rule...

...recycling or the fact
that you're Jewish.

Got it, got it. Will you
e-mail me that list, heh?

So the thing to watch for, if he's
shouting at you, you're okay.

But if he starts to get real quiet...

...leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

Not in a straight line, throw
some zigs and zags in there.

[SIGHS]

You know, this isn't that pressing.

Why don't I talk to him
about it in May, heh?

In May you're gonna be on the
International Space Station.

They got a phone.

[English - US - SDH]

- It was a nice retirement party.
- I guess.

Still, it's a shame Professor
Rothman was forced to step down.

Well, what choice did the university have?
He snapped.

It happens to theoretical
physicists all the time.

I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

These shrimp are all the same size.

There's no logical order
to eat them in.

Can't be very long.

Hey, look,
there's Rothman's empty office.

- Sad.
- Yeah.

- Indeed.
- So sad.

Dibs.

What's up, fellas?

What are you doing here, Kripke?

Measuring my new office for drapes.

This is not your office. It
hasn't been assigned yet.

I called dibs at Christmas when
Rothman tried to have intercourse...

...with the Toys for Tots
collection box.

Dibs? I mean, this is a
university, not a playground.

Offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs.

- You just called dibs.
- Shut it.

Offices are assigned by seniority.
I arrived at the university first.

I arrived at the office first.
I'm the proverbial early bird.

- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Rothman.

- Professor Roth man
- Professor Roth man.

Good evening.

LEONARD: Good evening.
- See you.

I'm glad
that men are wearing hats again.

They're so distinguished.

- I got you a little something.
- A little something?

Oh, it...

What? This is huge.

What's huge is what you've done
for me.

Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.

No, no. Before I met you,
I was a mousy Wallflower.

But look at me now.

I'm like some kind of downtown
hipster party girl...

...with a posse, a boyfriend...

...and a new lace bra that hooks
in the front, of all things.

- Open it, open it.
- Okay.

I wanted to get you
something you didn't have.

Wow. I don't know what to s... Wow.

- Do you like it'?
- Do I like it? Wow.

So where you gonna hang it?

Oh, my Go... Hang it. Wow. Um...

You know, I'd have to get a hook
and nails and a hammer, and...

- No problem.
- Oh, look.

You've got... You just... You
got it all right there. Wow.

I found him. He's in the bathroom.

- President Seibert?
- Can't this wait?

I'm sorry, we just need a word.

Now? You realize I'm your boss
and I am holding my penis.

Sheldon, give the man some privacy.

I'm sorry, this guy's got
no respect for boundaries.

What do you want?

Will you tell this lunatic
that Rothman's office is mine?

Take this up with your
department chairman.

His assistant said
he was on sabbatical.

Although, we distinctly heard his
office window open and shut.

Gentlemen, there's a task I'm
trying to accomplish here...

- ...and I'm having trouble doing it.
- Oh, my.

President Seibert, I don't
mean to be an alarmist...

...but difficulty initiating
a urine stream...

...could be a symptom of
benign prostatic hyperplasia.

If you're interested, I can send
you a link to a YouTube video...

...that'll show you how to
perform your own rectal exam.

Yeah, helpful hint:
Trim your nails first.

Ignore him, President Seibert.

I'm sure a young man such as yourself
has a perfectly healthy prostate.

Oh, he's just trying to butter you up.

And for the record, butter is an excellent
lubricant for your rectal exam.

Gentlemen, I'm going to allow
you to work this out...

...because, A, you're
brilliant scientists...

...and, B, as far as who
gets Rothman's office...

...I couldn't give the furry
crack of a rat's behind.

Well, as long as we're here,
I might as well take a leak.

- Kripke?
- Yes?

You're in my spot.

[SIGHS]

That is big.

So big.

- And ugly.
- So ugly.

What am I gonna do?

I don't know. You can't take it down.
You'll break her heart.

Look at that face.

That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.

Any chance I'll learn to love it?

That depends, do you like pictures of
yourself where you look like a man?

- All right. It's gotta go.
- What will you tell Amy?

How about I tell her the painting makes you
feel jealous because you're not in it'?

Oh, nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

I already have a picture
of me and Howard's mom...

...getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach.
I've suffered enough.

I could take it down and put it up when
she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

Too bad you're not as strong
as the dude in the painting.

Would you look at this?

I paid $25 to some kid on eBay for
a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

He sent me a stick.

He went into his backyard,
he picked up a stick.

It's numbered. Heh.

Ooh. Limited edition. Nice.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Oh, that'll be Kripke.
- What's he doing here?

We're going to work this office
situation out like gentlemen.

And if that doesn't work, I'm
going to poison his tea.

- Cooper.
- Kripke. Come in.

I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?

Am I wearing a summer frock?
No, I don't want tea.

Let's get down to brass tacks.

Fine. In the interest of
preserving our friendship...

- We're not friends.
- Well...

...that's a little hard
to hear, but all right.

As you know, the essence of
diplomacy is compromise.

With that in mind, I
propose the following.

I will take Rothman's office...

...and you will find a way
to be okay with that.

How about I take Rothman's
office and you go suck a lemon?

[CHUCKLES]

You sure I can't get you
that cup of tea?

How about you decide this with Rock,
Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?

What the frig is that?

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock...

...was created by Internet
pioneer Sam Kass...

...as an improvement on the
game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

All hail Sam Kass.

ALL:
Hail.

How does it work?

Oh, it's very simple.

Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock...

...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

...Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

...lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

...Spock vaporizes rock...

...and, as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

Well, of course. Scissors cuts
paper, paper covers rock...

...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

...Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

...lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

...Spock vaporizes rock...

...and, as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

Almost got it. One more time.

Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock...

Sheldon, stop.
He's screwing with you.

Is he?

Well, then, seems we
have reached an impasse.

I see no other option than
to challenge you to a duel.

I'd smack you with a glove, but just last
week, I packed away my winter things.

It's the 21st century,
you can't have a duel.

Hang on, Howard.

Barry, how good of a shot are you?

Not pistols. Minds.

A trivia contest. And you may
choose the field of battle.

<i>Star Trek trivia, Star Trek:
Next Generation trivia...</i>

<i>...Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia,
Star Trek: Voyager trivia...</i>

...or model trains.

You have an advantage in trivia.
You have an eidetic memory.

Plus, I haven't watched Star Trek...

...since I discovered the strip club
near my apartment has a free buffet.

It's hard to find something
you're both equally good at.

Is there anything
you're equally bad at?

- Sports.
- Sports.

All right, this is one-on-one,
first to five wins the office.

Any questions? Yes, Sheldon.

Five what?

Balls in the basket.

[SQUEALS]

[YELLS]

That's out, right?

Time. Ran out of room.

You know those terrible things
bullies used to do to us?

- Yeah?
- I get it.

KRIPKEI Uhn!
SHELDON: OW!

Hey!

- He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

Nothing that's happening here
is being done on purpose.

Okay, forget one-on-one. Let's
try a free-throw contest.

First person who makes a
basket wins the office.

- Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
- Nope. No, I'm not.

Use the Force, Sheldon.
Use the Force.

I'm gonna need more Force.

All right, Cooper. Prepare
to have your heart broken.

[BALL THUDS]

Do I get points for that?

Hah!

[SHELDON & KRIPKE
GASPING & PANTING]

All right, we gave it 45 minutes.

It's no longer funny.
Let's try something else.

What do you propose?

Uh... On three, both of you bounce
the balls as hard as you can.

Highest bounce wins the office.

Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

I don't think so, Kripke.

I've bounced many a rubber ball
in my day.

All right. That's enough trash talk.

One, two, three.

Sheldon was higher.

Congratulations, Sheldon,
you win the office.

Who's unsatisfactory in PE now?

<i>MAN & WOMAN [SINGING
OVER TV]: We go together</i>

<i>Like rama lama lama Ke
ding a de dinga a dong</i>

Oh, what a great movie.

I cannot believe
you've never seen Grease.

My mother didn't allow me
to watch it.

She was afraid it might
encourage me to join a gang.

I gotta go. I gotta get up early.

My company's testing a new steroid
that doesn't shrink testicles...

...and the last one there
has to do the measuring.

Guess I should get going too.

Good night, painting Penny.

Good night, real Penny.

Good night, real Amy.

You don't have to say good night to
painting Amy, she's never leaving.

- Good night, real Penny.
- Bye.

Good night, transvestite Penny.

[DOOR CLOSES]

[SIGHS]

Okay, let us take you off the wall.

[GRUNTS]

Out of sight, out of mind.

I Wish.

Can I borrow that movie?

Those singing hooligans
really got my motor running.

Sure, sure. Enjoy.

You get it back to me
when you can or...

You keep it. It's just
gonna be my gift to you.

Thank you. Wait...
Where'd the painting go?

- It's right over there.
- Why?

I have no idea. That is weird.

You hate it.

- No, no, no. It's just... It's a little big.
- I feel like an idiot.

You're not an idiot. Just
help me put it back up.

So you can just take it down
when I leave?

- I don't need your pity.
- Oh, Amy, come on.

I'm just glad I didn't
go for the sculpture.

Ahh. The spoils.

I see why victors love them.

I'm happy for you, Sheldon,
but I have to admit...

...I'm going to miss sharing
an office with you.

Oh, of course you are.

Well, feel free to drop by any time.

- Thank you.
- Yeah. Call first.

Oh, hello.

Professor Roth man.

This isn't your office anymore.
You're retired.

I think the word you're
looking for is "invisible."

I came to say I'm sorry.

- Don't bother.
- Oh, Amy, please.

I'm so humiliated. I sat there the
whole time we were watching Grease...

- ...thinking you liked the painting.
- I know.

I was a fool from "summer loving"...

...to the last "rama lama lama
ke ding a de dinga a dong."

You're absolutely right.

I should have been honest and
told you the gift was too much.

Yes, too much. Because our friendship
is fundamentally asymmetrical.

I clearly like you
more than you like me.

I don't think you put a number on
how much one person likes another.

I bought you a painting that's
12 square feet in area.

There's a number.

Amy, come...

If you don't like feet, you can try dollars.
The painting set me back 3 grand.

Three gr...? Oh, my God.

Look, Amy, all you need to
know is you are my friend.

I don't wanna lose you out of my life.

I'm sorry, I'm just having
trouble believing you right now.

- Grab your hammer.
- No, damage is done.

Okay, look, I didn't wanna say this...

...but the real reason I
took the painting down...

...was because it made
Bernadette very jealous.

Oh, my goodness.

How could I have not seen that?

The painting is a constant reminder
that of the three of us...

...she is the least cool.

Yeah, that's what it is, so...

- You have such a good heart.
- Oh. I try.

- Come on.
- Well, where are we going?

We're gonna put this back up.

What about Bernadette?

Oh, screw her. She's just lucky
we let her hang outwith us.

[WHIRRING]

What are you doing?

I'm trying to raise the
temperature in here...

...before my nipples
tear through my shirt.

Why don't you
just turn up the thermostat?

Aha. Good question.

It turns out that the thermostat for
my new office isn't in my new office.

No, it's next door in Professor
Davenport's office...

...who is currently enjoying the hot
flashes associated with menopause.

Why is there a hole here?

Why is there a hole in my new office?

I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities.

There was something in the wall that
someone outside the wall wanted.

Or the more disturbing...

...there was something in
the wall that wanted out.

At least you got a window that opens.
That's nice.

Oh. Is it? Listen.

[WIND CHIMES TINKLING]

- What, you don't like wind chimes?
- No, I hate them, but it gets worse.

[BIRD TWEETING]

- There it is.
- The bird?

Yeah, it's completely out of
tune with the wind chimes.

- So?
- You don't get it, do you?

That's a mockingbird. Mockingbirds
can change their song...

...which means he's out
of tune on purpose.

He's mocking me.

[RUMBLING]

Oh, dear, there it is again.
Do you feel it?

The growing realization that you
are one wacky bastard? Yep.

No. The vibration.

We are directly underneath
the geology lab...

...and they're running
their sieve shakers again.

Hey, gravel monkeys, you
need to shake rocks?

Try jiggling your heads around!

- Sheldon, relax.
- How can I relax?

My nervous system is being stretched
out like the strings of a harp...

...and plucked by holes
and birds and wind...

...and the low-hanging scrotum of the
difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.

If you're not happy, just
let Kripke have the office.

Wait, and let him win?
Do I look crazy to you?

We're trying to think down here,
you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!

And you,
the notes are C, D, E, G and A.

You pick one or I'm
chopping down that tree!

- How's that?
- Little higher on the right.

- Now?
- Little more.

No. That's got it.

Yeah, okay. That's good.

- I'll let you in on a little secret.
- Mm.

Originally, we were painted nude.

But I had him add clothes because
it was an unnecessary challenge...

...to our heterosexuality.

Yeah, good call.

If you change your mind, all it would
take is some warm soapy water...

...and a couple of sponges.

- You're talking about the painting, right?
- Sure.

SHELDON:
Help! Somebody, help!

What happened?

I was trying to see what was
in here and my head got stuck.

Why would you do that?

SHELDON:
It's called scientific curiosity.

Now go get butter.

Okay, okay. Hang in there.
I'll be right back.

[English - US - SDH]

I'm gonna run to the store. I'll
pick you up when you're done.

Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello.

I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

Why do these things
always happen to me?

- I can cut it for you.
- You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

You believe this guy?

Excuse us for a second.

Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

An example of the nepotism...

...that runs rampant in
the barbering industry.

Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
how I like my hair done...

...because he has all my haircut
records from my barber in Texas.

What are you talking about?

When I first moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

...so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

There's no such thing
as haircut records.

- Yes, there are.
- Have you ever seen them?

No, but my mother assured
me they were sent here...

...and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

Excuse me.

Do you have access
to my haircut records?

Your what?

To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this
is the way the world ends.

Not with a bang but with a nephew.

Sheldon, you're a grown
man, he's a professional...

...and your haircut is number
three on that poster from 1946.

- Just sit down and let him do it.
- Fine.

But if I come out of this looking
like a dork, it's on you.

- So my kid said the funniest thing today.
- Nope.

When you tell this story later, the
word we usually use is "quirky."

- Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
- Sure.

[BLOWING]

- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

Sheldon, you are one day
late for your haircut.

Thank you
for captioning my nightmare.

- Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
- Hmm.

"Payload Specialist Howard
Wolowitz is requested to report...

...to the NASA Johnson Space
Center, Houston, Texas...

...for astronaut training
Monday 8 a.m."

Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

But it says 8 a.m.

- You read it as 0800.
- It doesn't have an O in front of it.

It does have an O in front of it.

Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy.

So, what kind of things are they...?
Will you stop that?

I can't help it, I feel
like a teen heartthrob.

Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

Penny, I know you mean well, offering
the skills of the hill folk...

...but here in town, we don't
churn our own butter...

...we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks...

...and we sure as shooting don't get
our hair cut by bottle-blond...

Sheldon, be nice.

I'm sorry, it's the bad-boy
attitude that comes with this hair.

You could go to my guy. He's
at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

They bring you a cup of
tea, massage your scalp.

It's $200 but sometimes you
look in the next chair...

...and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

Quick question here, have we
actually changed the conversation...

...from "I'm going to astronaut training"
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

Now who's dying of jealousy?
"Oh," it's you.

[SINGING] I'm a cowboy

<i>On a steel horse I ride</i>

<i>I'm wanted</i>

<i>I'm wanted</i>

<i>Wanted Dead or alive</i>

Sheldon, you're ruining
girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.

I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

My hair is growing...

...at the rate of 4.6
yoctometers per femtosecond.

If you're quiet, you can hear it.

- What about Supercuts?
- No, I tried once.

They do men's and women's hair in
the same room at the same time.

It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't you
just let your hair grow out a little?

Why don't I let my hair grow out?

Why don't I start wearing
Birkenstocks...

...and seeking validation of my
opinions by asking, "Can you dig it?"

I don't know. I think you might
look sexy with long hair.

With the kind that flows
down to your shoulders...

...and blows back
while riding on a horse.

Bareback and bare-chested.

I'm gonna go brush my teeth,
it might take a while.

<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi, sweetie.

- <i>I miss you.</i>
- I miss you too.

So tell me all about your first day.

<i>Oh, wow, where do I even start? I
got to experience zero gravity.</i>

- Cool. How do they do that?
- <i>It's pretty neat.</i>

<i>You get in this plane that goes almost
straight up for like 20 seconds...</i>

<i>...and then straight back
down like it's gonna crash...</i>

<i>...and they do it over and over again,
no matter how many times you throw up.</i>

- You threw up?
- <i>Yeah. And the craziest part is...</i>

<i>...because there's no gravity, the
throw-up kind of floats there.</i>

<i>In a little ball, and if
your mouth is open...</i>

<i>...because you're screaming...</i>

<i>...sometimes it just
floats right back in.</i>

<i>Boy, does everyone laugh
at you when that happens.</i>

- That sounds mean.
- No.

<i>I would have laughed too...</i>

<i>...but I didn't want the
vomit to come back out.</i>

[LAUGHS]

Heh. Anyway...

<i>Oh, could you do me a favor...</i>

<i>...and overnight me
some more underwear?</i>

- Sure, why?
- <i>I got a look at the centrifuge...</i>

<i>...they're gonna spin me
around in tomorrow...</i>

<i>...and I have a hunch I
packed a little light.</i>

Mr. D'Onofrio?

It's me, Sheldon.

They didn't have anything
barber-themed in the gift shop...

...so I got you this.

Don't know if you can read his little T-shirt.
It says, "Get well beary soon."

Trust me, if you were even a little
conscious right now, you'd be laughing.

[CHUCKLES]

Anyway...

There's new studies that show...

...people in comas are aware of
everything going on around them.

With that in mind, if you can hear me...

...move away from the light and
toward the sound of these scissors.

- Can I help you?
- Yes.

Do you have something I
could use as a cape?

Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,
slip out of the ninth floor...

...and go on a little adventure?

Oh, no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.

[BLOW$]

I see. Just wait here one moment.

Security!

I gotta run. But not with scissors.
That would be unsafe.

So if I move my horsey here...

...isn't that checkmate and I win?

<i>Hmm.</i>

Oh... Is it or isn't it?

You know, I think this is
a good stopping point.

It's your first real game. I threw
a lot of information at you.

No, your king is trapped.

He can't go here because
of my lighthouse...

...and...

...he can't go here because
of my pointy-head guy.

Like I said, complicated game.

- So did I win or not?
- Did you have fun?

Because if you had fun,
then you are a winner.

That's what chess is all about.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.

Why? My spot, your spot. What
difference does it make?

- Okay, what just happened?
- I don't know.

Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer...

...and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot...

...I'm guessing someone
went back in time...

...stepped on a bug, and changed
the course of human events.

- Sweetie, are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

It's been six days since I was
supposed to get a haircut...

...and nothing horrible has happened.

Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

- Leonard, explain it to her.
- Oh, uh, he's crazy.

I have spent my whole life trying
to bring order to the universe...

...by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

But all my efforts, our dinner
schedule, my pajama rotation...

...my bowel movement spreadsheet...

It's clear now,
I've been wasting my time.

Good. I'm taking that disgusting
chart off the fridge.

You know...

...sometimes it's nice not
knowing what's coming.

Look at me and Leonard.

We went out, broke up,
trying again.

We don't know what's gonna happen.

Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

But I see your point.

I think this could be good for you.

Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

You're right.

I should embrace the chaos.

- Great. What are you gonna do first?
- I don't know.

I could do anything. All bets are off.

The world is my oyster.

I got it.

I'm gonna put on my
Tuesday pajamas tonight.

I got to tell you, I'm a
little worried about him.

If I were you, I'd be worried...

...that a girl who's never played chess
in her life just kicked your ass.

<i>Hi.</i>

Howie, what happened to you?

<i>We did overnight survival
training in the wilderness.</i>

<i>Big fun. Big, big fun.</i>

<i>I was gonna freshen up for you...</i>

<i>...but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.</i>

Survival training?
Is that like camping?

<i>Uh-huh. Except you don't
have food or water...</i>

<i>...and they don't have a
sunset Sabbath service...</i>

<i>...like they do at Camp Hess Kramer.</i>

- Do you sleep in tents?
- No.

<i>I slept in a hole I dug in the
ground with my bare hands.</i>

<i>And at some point during the
night, an armadillo crawled</i> in...

<i>...and spooned me.</i>

- Poor baby.
- <i>But I did it. I survived.</i>

<i>I wasn't sure I was going
to when the sandstorm hit</i>

<i>I just pulled my turtleneck up
over my head and waited for death.</i>

<i>But somehow as I sat there...</i>

<i>...wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat...</i>

<i>...I found that primal part
of the human spirit...</i>

<i>...that just wants to keep on living,
heh-heh, no matter what the cost.</i>

You're so brave. I'm proud of you.

<i>I ate a butterfly.</i>

<i>It was so small...</i>

<i>...beautiful...</i>

<i>...but I was so hungry.</i>

- Are you crying?
- <i>No, I don't think it's possible.</i>

<i>I'm severely dehydrated.</i>

<i>My pee is like toothpaste.</i>

Howie, if you're not able
to do this, come home.

It won't change how I feel about you.

<i>Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.</i>

<i>Lfl do, I'djust be a guy...</i>

<i>...who had a chance to be an
astronaut and gave it up.</i>

Is there anything I could do to help?

<i>No.</i>

<i>Wait. Send more underwear.</i>

[BONGOS PLAYING OUTSIDE]

Don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

Please, don't let this be
Sheldon playing bongos.

<i>[SINGING] Hello, Leonard,
Do you like my bongos?</i>

<i>Bet you didn't know
that I had bongos</i>

Sheldon, it's 3:00 in the morning.

<i>Three in the morning ls
a good time for bongos</i>

I was sleeping.

<i>Leonard sleeps while I play bongos</i>

No, he doesn't.

<i>Leonard no sleep while I play bongos</i>

Bongo solo.

Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.

Stop it.

- What the hell?
- Oh, hi, Penny, guess what?

Sheldon got bongos.

- Why did you get bongos?
- Richard Feynman played the bongos.

I thought I'd try.

Feynman was a famous physicist.

It's 3:00 in the morning.

I don't care if Richard Feynman was a
purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

<i>[SINGING] Penny meant If he
were a purple leprechaun</i>

<i>Penny forgot to use the subjunctive</i>

Sheldon, go to bed. You
have work in the morning.

Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I
start a bongo band and tour the world.

No, hang on. Roommate Agreement.

No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or
barbershop quartets after 10 p.m.

Roommate Agreement?
Are you kidding?

We are living in a world of chaos.

Roommate Agreement.

- Where are you going?
- Wherever the music takes me, kitten.

<i>SHELDON [SINGING]: I play
bongos walking down the stairs</i>

Uh! Oh!

<i>Never play bongos
Walking down the stairs</i>

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Surprise.
- What are you doing here?

Here to help you get through this.

Can't do it on your own, you need
someone to take care of you.

- Oh. I love you so much.
- Oh, and I love you.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
your bath is getting cold.

Don't worry, once she falls asleep,
I'll spoon you like an armadillo. Heh.

He showed up in the middle of
the night with his bongos.

I foolishly thought it was some
sort of musical booty call.

Poor guy.
He must have been exhausted.

<i>[SINGING] Sheldon like to sleep
While Leonard play the bongo</i>

- That was kind of uncalled for.
- No, it was called for.

What's going on?

Sheldon, this craziness
has gone on long enough.

Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

Penny, you're not trained.
You're not licensed.

And most importantly, you don't
have access to my haircut records.

All right, honey, look...

...we've known each other
for a long time now, right?

I've taken you to Disneyland, I
kicked a bully in the nuts for you.

I sing you "Soft Kitty" when you're
sick, you've even seen me naked once.

I'm sorry, what?

It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon,
I promise I know what I'm doing.

Please let me cut your hair.

Amy, what do you think?

There's not a hair on my body I
wouldn't let this woman trim.

Fine, let's go.

Thank you for letting
me sleep on your couch.

There's only so many times a woman
can say, "How about the bed?"

LEONARD: What's this about
Sheldon seeing you naked?

Oh, relax. It was just her
bottom and her breasts.

Almost done.

At the end of the haircut, Mr. D'Onofrio
would tell me a dirty joke.

Oh, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.

That's okay, I never
understood them anyway.

Okay, what do you think?

Hmm. Well, it's a little Hollywood.

But I think I can pull it off.
Well done, Penny.

Told you. I'm just gonna clean
up your neck a little...

- ...and then you are good to go.
- Fun time.

[CLIPPERS WHIRRING]

[GIGGLES]

Sorry,
sometimes the clippers tickle me.

Okay.

[LAUGHS]

Okay, yep, we're all done now.
It's... It's good.

Let me just take that away from you.
Okay.

- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

[MOUTHS] Okay.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to move. Ahem.

[English - US - SDH]

Wanna spend time playing the new
"Star Wars" game this weekend?

Mm, I don't know, I promised
myself I'd get off the computer...

...be more physically
active, get some exercise.

You're about to walk up
three flights of stairs.

Well, good point. I'm in.

You know what would be great?
Let's do it like the old days.

- Mm, you talking gaming marathon?
- Yeah.

Start Saturday morning, go 48
hours, sleeping bags, junk food.

HOWARD: Turn off our phones
so our moms can't call.

It'll be like our "World of Warcraft" party
when the neighbors called the cops on us.

[HOWARD CHUCKLES]

They called the cops because of the smell.
They thought we were dead.

We were bad-ass back in the day.

- All right, let's do it.
- Forty-eight hours of "Star Wars" gaming.

It's on like Alderaan.

[ALL CHUCKLE]

Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

Starting Saturday morning,
"Star Wars" marathon.

- Woo-hoo.
- Movies or video games?

Or board games? Or trading-card games?

Or Legos? Or dress-up? Or comic books?

Or dramatic readings of novelizations?

Yes to all.

We are going to play the online game.

The online game? Bully.

As much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy...

...playing intergalactic
make-believe, he and I have plans.

We are attending my Aunt
Flora's 93rd birthday party.

Just tell her I can't come.

She'll be disappointed if we don't show.

She's 93. She won't be
disappointed for very long.

Hang on. I followed all the protocols...

...set forth by you in the
Relationship Agreement.

I made a written request
72 hours in advance.

Checked the tire pressure on the car.

I contacted the Centers
for Disease Control...

...to find out what shots they
recommend for travel to Orange County.

FYI, it's none.

Amy, the Relationship Agreement...

...was not designed for either
one of us to get our way.

You use it to get your way.

I use it to get the right way.

The fact that the right way is also
my way is a happy coincidence.

You gave me your word.
You're coming with me.

We'll miss you, Sheldon.

Yeah? Well, who wants to
spend the whole weekend...

...running around a bunch of pretend
planets battling made-up monsters?

- That's for babies.
- Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

Yeah. Please, Amy, it's got lightsabers.

- Hello, Stuart.
- Hey, Sheldon.

- Help you with anything?
- Yes.

I'm attending a party this
weekend for a 93-year-old woman.

Can you recommend a gift?

Uh, I don't know.

Could put a tennis ball on
the end of Excalibur...

...make a pretty bad-ass cane.

Do you supply the ball?

- No.
- Then no.

- What else?
- Uh, oh.

Got this collector's edition
Batman Utility Belt.

Maybe she could use it as
a wearable pill caddy.

Well, she'd just look silly wearing
that without the rest of the costume.

Um, sorry, Sheldon, that's it.
That's all I got.

It's not your fault. I've been
to the model-train store.

I've been to Radio Shack. This
woman's impossible to shop for.

I'd make fun of Sheldon for
having girl problems...

...if I wasn't in shock that
Sheldon has girl problems.

Well, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

It's like my daddy always said:

"Shelly, women aren't anything but
flipping pains in the bottom."

That's what your father used to say?

Well, I took out the bad words and
the "yeehaw," but you get the gist.

If you don't wanna go to the party, just don't go.
You're a grown man.

Act like one. Tell Amy you wanna spend
the weekend having a sleepover...

...and playing video
games with your friends.

Yeah, maybe she'll dig it. Women
like a firm hand on the tiller.

I can never find the tiller.

I got a book. It didn't help.

Yeah, I always thought if
I were ever enslaved...

...it would be by an advanced
species from another planet...

...not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

I downloaded an app that might
be helpful in this situation.

[WHIP CRACKS ON PHONE]

[HOWARD, RAJESH & LEONARD
LAUGHING]

You're right. I'm smart as a whip. I
should be able to figure this out.

Listen, I kind of made plans
with the guys this weekend.

I wondered, because we're in
this relationship beta test...

...if I should have asked you first.

Then I thought if I did
check with you first...

...you'd think that I was
taking things too seriously...

...and then I got a nosebleed.

You don't have to check with me.
Do whatever you want.

Oh.

Guess I was hoping for a
different reaction, but okay.

- Really? What were you hoping for?
- I don't know.

Maybe that you'd be a little upset.

And then you'd realize that I'm a
stallion that has to run free.

And that would turn you on a little.

Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.

[CLEARS THROAT]

Do you mind if I spend the weekend
playing games with the guys?

Wha...? The entire weekend? You
mean I wouldn't see you at all?

But I do... No, no, I knew
what I was getting into.

You can't put a saddle
on Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, my, is it getting hot in here?
Ay, Papi.

"Ay,

- What is that?
- An acting choice.

LEONARD:
Hmm.

So you chose that when
you become turned on...

...you'd turn into Speedy Gonzalez.

Do you got a problem
with that, <i>Papi?</i>

Uh-uh.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Penny? Penny? Penny?

Sorry, Stallion. Your weird
friend Giraffe is here.

Hello, Penny. I just stopped
by to bring you this gift.

Gummi Bears? Thank you.

Now that you're in my debt...

[PENNY SIGHS]

...please manipulate Amy into
releasing me from my commitment...

...to attend her aunt's
tedious birthday party.

- Not a chance.
- All right.

I thought the candy might not be
enough, so let me up the ante.

Ahem. These are Cooper Coupons.

These are for various
things I can do for you.

Um, oh, this one is for
one free grammar check.

Uh...

You could use it for e-mails,
letters, tattoos, what have you.

Uh...

Oh, this is a fun one. This
is an afternoon with me...

...at the California Science Center
where I point out their mistakes.

Keep an eye on those expiration dates.
I've been burned more than once.

I'm not gonna get involved
in your relationship.

Come on. It's just a simple favor.
When's the last time...

- ...I asked you to do something for me?
- Yesterday.

You made me look in your ear to
see if there was a ladybug in it.

Last time I asked you to do something
that wasn't a medical emergency?

Yesterday. You made me look in your ear
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

All right, I have no choice...

- ...but to go on to plan B.
- What's that?

Run around outside with a wet
head and try to catch a cold.

- Good morning.
- Hello.

I think you'll really enjoy yourself today.
You get to meet my relatives.

Since my aunt's nursing home
is catering the party...

...all the food is incredibly soft.
It's like a vacation for your teeth.

All right.

- You sure you're okay with this?
- Yes.

I decided to find a way that I could
have this experience and enjoy it.

Thank you. That means a lot to me.

Oh, don't thank me. Thank
wireless technology.

Yeah, I realized I can go to
your aunt's awful party...

...and still spend the whole
day gaming with my friends.

My relatives are gonna wanna talk to you.

And you're gonna be sitting
there playing a game?

- Isn't that a little rude?
- Oh, I got that covered.

Headset. I won't hear a word
the old geezers are saying.

If playing that game is more important
than honoring your commitment to me...

...and you don't mind me
showing up all by myself...

...after I've told everybody
I'll be bringing somebody...

...then fine, go home and play your game.

[ENGINE STARTS]

Thanks. Oh, listen.

I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake...

...provided the old gal's
candle blow is clean and dry.

Here you go. I've got everything
we'll need for the big game.

Low-fat turkey jerky.

Low-carb beer.

Hundred-calorie snack packs.

Pick up a Y chromosome while you were there?
You might be short one.

Hey, I plan on leveling up in the
game, not my swimsuit size...

...thank you very much.

Gentlemen,
the game offers us a choice...

...between playing for the
Republic and the light side...

...or the Sith Empire and the dark side.

We're always the good guys.
In "D&D" we're lawful good.

In "City of Heroes" we're heroes.
In "Grand Theft Auto"...

...we pay the prostitutes promptly
and never hit them with a bat.

Those women are prostitutes?

You said they were raising
money for stem-cell research.

Hey, guys. I got a surprise.

Mm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies
poop, I think Raj beat you to it.

No, Bernadette's gonna be playing with us.

So that's pretty cool, huh?
Right? Sure, it is.

Wha...? You invited your girlfriend?

- This is supposed to be our weekend.
- I had no choice.

She said, "Why don't we go out for
brunch and maybe the arboretum?"

I said, "No, I promised the guys I was
gonna play a video game with them."

She said, "Can I come?" Then I
didn't answer for a second.

Then she said, "Do you
not want me to come?"

Then I bought her a new
laptop and the game...

...and she's parking the car now.

Is the whip-sound app
contextually appropriate here?

Uh, it is, but I think you might have
waited too long for it to be funny.

[WHIP CRACKS ON PHONE]

[LEONARD AND RAJESH LAUGHING]

- I was wrong. It's still funny.
- Oh, good.

[CACKLES]

Oh.

- Amy, what's wrong?
- My boyfriend's a jerk.

Well, I know he didn't cheat
on you, so, what happened?

I had to go to my aunt's party by myself.

Everybody was like, "Where's this
boyfriend you talk about? Is he real?

Or did you make him up like Armin
the miniature-horse breeder?"

Who's Armin the miniature-horse breeder?

The pretend boyfriend I invented
to get my family off my back.

It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer
the question "How did you two meet?"

- I would've thought at a horse show.
- Oh, that's good.

Mm.

I panicked and said Woodstock.

[SIGHS]

I just wanted to show
Sheldon off to my family.

Sure, I get that. I mean, he's
your first boyfriend and all.

Not just my first boyfriend. He's the best boyfriend.
I mean, think about it.

I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.

Yes, on purpose.

He's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant.

His skin has that pale, waxy quality.

Well, sickly is the new sexy.

- Yeah.
- Mm.

You know, Amy...

...when you're in a relationship with
someone you really care about...

...the sucky part is it leaves
you open to getting hurt.

Do you ever worry about
Leonard doing that to you?

Ha, ha, that's hilarious. No.

Get that guy! Get that guy!

Pew, pew, pew!

Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, it may
interest you to know...

...that saying, "Pew, pew, pew," isn't as
effective as pressing your blaster key.

In the same way that saying, "Whee,"
doesn't make the landspeeder go.

Pew!

- Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
RAJESH: Unh. Got him.

When Gandhi advocated his
philosophy of nonviolence...

...I bet he didn't know how
much fun it was killing stuff.

All right, I think we got them all.
Let's divide up the loot.

BERNADETTE: Ooh, look at this
pretty purple robe I just got.

You should put on yours
and then we'll match.

But I worked hard to get this armor, heh.

Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice
if people knew we were a couple.

Fine, I'll change.

[WHIP CRACKS ON PHONE]

[CACKLES]

I don't think I wanna play a game.

They're playing one across the hall.
We should too.

Okay, we are gonna take turns
bouncing a quarter off the table.

If it goes into this cup, the
other person has to drink.

Then you get to go again, and you ki...

- Like that?
- Wow, yeah, beginner's luck.

So now I will drink this
entire cup of beer...

...and you will go again and we can...

All right, so, yeah. Okay, now
I'm gonna drink this entire cup.

And then I'm going to drink another one.

Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?

I spent my childhood throwing coins
into wishing wells hoping for friends.

At a certain point, you start doing
trick shots to keep things interesting.

Oh, give me a second to
catch up here, hold on.

[MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY
THROUGH WALL]

That'd be my boyfriend...

...happier playing his Star Trek game
with friends than hanging outwith me.

- Wars.
- What?

Star Wars. They get all cranky
when you mix the two up.

- What's the difference?
- There's absolutely no difference.

How do I get him to treat me better?

All right, let me give you
a little Girlfriend 101.

Usually the first move
is you withhold sex...

...but that will work better
after Sheldon hits puberty.

So I'd say give him the silent treatment.

- No, he loves that.
- Hmm.

Our record for sitting in a room
together and not speaking...

...is six and a half hours. He
said it was a magical evening.

All right, we're gonna have to
go with an oldie but goodie:

- Making a scene.
- I don't think I'd be good at that.

Ah. You're lucky to have me.
Back in Omaha...

...there are two restaurants I'm
not allowed into. Both Chili's.

Bernadette, your character
is the healer in our group.

In charge of healing all
of us, not just Howard.

Can't help it. My Howie-Wowie
has an owie. Ha, ha.

That is the most sickeningly sweet
thing I have ever experienced.

And I am sipping Kool-Aid
through a Red Vine.

Sheldon, I've got a bone to pick with you,
and I'll do it in front of all your friends.

Yeah, you pick that bone.
You pick that bone clean.

I'm gonna publicly shame
you and then sit back...

...as societal pressure compels
you to modify your behavior.

Oh, burn!

If you don't start treating
me better, I'm leaving you...

...for a miniature-horse
breeder named Armin.

- Armin who?
- Armin... Damn it.

Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to
her family and you stood her up, okay?

I mean, look at this
adorable, smushy face.

Smush, smush, smush.

- You're hurting me.
- No, Sheldon hurt you.

- Before. Now it's you.
- Oh.

I think I understand.

You're the one person who can say
Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend.

But that rings hollow if you can't
lord him over others in the flesh.

I forget what I bring to the party
and what I take away when I leave.

Please accept these
valuable Cooper Coupons...

-...as restitution.
- She doesn't want your stupid coupons...

The Science Center? Redeeming. Let's go.

Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler.
Let me get my coat.

[WHIP CRACKS ON PHONE]

Oh, grow up, Leonard.

Excuse me, I have something to say.

None of you may realize it, but I was very
much looking forward to this weekend.

It was gonna be like the old days.
The four of us hanging out...

...playing video games, before
you guys all got girlfriends.

Do you have any idea what it's like to
be the only one without a girlfriend?

Even if I get one someday...

...I'll still be the guy who got
a girl after Sheldon Cooper!

And that's how a girl makes a scene.

I'm sorry. You're right.
You deserve your weekend.

- Come on, Amy, let's go.
- What about the Science Center?

Oh, I'll let you hold my
hair while I throw up.

Rain check.

- I'm gonna go too.
- I'll miss you.

- I'll miss you.
- But I'll miss you more.

- No, I'll miss you...
- Just leave.

Ahh. Okay, now, this is the
way it's supposed to be.

Men together, fighting the forces of evil.

HOWARD: All right.
- Hear, hear.

Ah.

Can't believe this is only 64 calories.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard Joel Wolowitz,
I've been worried sick for two days...

...and I know you turned off your phone!

You open up this door right now,
because I've had it up to here!

I have been to the morgue
and the hospital...

...and I've spent the last half-hour
walking up these farkakte stairs!

That's my ride. Gotta go, heh.

[WHIP CRACKS ON PHONE]

[English - US - SDH]

Oh, my God, I love this chicken.

Oh, you know what they say, "The
best things in life are free."

You're right. I eat your food a lot.
How about this?

You can raid my fridge
any time you want.

Oh, that's very kind of you.

Next time I have a hankering to
wash down a D-cell battery...

...with a jar of old pickle
juice, I'll come a-knocking.

Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

I'm supposed to ask you if
you're bringing someone.

I'll let you know.

Could you make it soon? There's
a battle over seating.

In one corner, Bernadette's mom.
In the other three, mine.

Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.
I wish the bride and groom...

...would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

Oh, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

Oh, that was a night to remember.

Do you know, on one trip, I
just had a bowl of nuts.

Anyway, you gotta let me
know if you have a plus-one.

If not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor...

...who sucked the fat out of her neck.

All right, uh, fine.

I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

Koothrappali plus one.

- Who are you bringing?
- Who are you bringing?

He's bringing me. Who are you bringing?

Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

Come on, who is it?

I'm not telling. I'm from Asia.
I'm mysterious. Deal with it.

Howard, are you having a
make-your-own-sundae bar?

Uh, I don't think so.

Well, you should. Fifty percent
of marriages end in divorce.

But 100 percent of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.

[BEEPS]

<i>- Hello, Mommy, Daddy. How are you?
- Pretty good, can't complain.</i>

<i>Oh, I'm sure you can.
Just give it a minute.</i>

Listen, uh...

There's something I want
to talk to you about.

I wasn't ready until now
but I think it's time.

<i>It's finally happening.</i>

<i>You're coming out of the
closet, aren't you?</i>

<i>We love you and we accept
your alternate lifestyle.</i>

<i>Just keep it to yourself.</i>

No, I'm not gay.

If anything, I'm metrosexual.

<i>What's that?</i>

It means I like women as well
as their skin-care products.

<i>Well, if you're not coming out...</i>

<i>...why did you call us during
the cricket semi-finals?</i>

I'm tired of trying to meet someone...

...and I think I'd like
you to help me find a...

A wife.

<i>And just to clarify, a female wife?</i>

Yes!

<i>Matchmaking. Very smart move, son.</i>

<i>Much better than marrying for love.</i>

<i>We married for love.</i>

<i>And it's been wonderful.</i>

Quantum physics makes me so happy.

Yeah? I'm glad.

It's like looking at the universe naked.

[MOANS]

[KNOCKING]

- Hi. Guys got a minute?
- Sure, what's up?

I was thinking about Sheldon's
little joke the other night...

- ...about me eating all your food.
- Oh, that was no joke.

But I understand your confusion as
I am our group's resident cutup.

I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

Yes.

- Prove it.
- Knock-knock.

- Who's there?
- Interrupting physicist.

- Interrupting phys...
- Muon. Ha, ha.

Anyway, I got a little residual
check from my commercial.

And I thought, "How about I get the guys
a little thank-you to pay them back?"

So, Sheldon... Ta-da.

[GASPS]

A vintage, mint-in-box 1975
Mego Star Trek Transporter...

...with real transporter action. Hot darn!

- Where did you get that?
- From Stuart at the comic-book store.

You went to the comic-book
store by yourself?

Yeah. It was fun.

I walked in and two different
guys got asthma attacks.

Felt pretty good.

Well, this calls for an
expression of gratitude.

Ooh, am I about to get a
rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

No, not this time. Then
they wouldn't be special.

Click. Thanks, Penny.

You're welcome.

Don't worry, I didn't forget about you.

Leonard, I got you a label-maker.

Wow.

No, it's great.

- Also, uh, mint-in-box.
- Mm.

- And I got you a Transporter too!
- Awesome!

Look, it was actually designed for
my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

Oh, that's great. Open
it and put him in there.

- Open it'?
- No, good Lord, no.

Why? They're just toys.

- Collectibles.
- They're mint-in-box.

Can't we open one up and take a look?

- Aah!
- No, don't!

Once you open the box, it loses its value.

Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the
same lecture about my virginity.

Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun
taking it out and playing with it.

You sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

Oh, yes. In my culture, it's expected to
have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

I want to make a good impression.
No offense, but with you here...

...I look like I'm 6'2".

The nuns always chaperoned the
dances at my high school.

They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

RAJESH:
Hmm.

Hindus do the same thing. Except
they leave room for a cow. Ha, ha.

Listen, I love your charming
racist humor.

But any chance you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

- You made fun of me for eating lox.
- Your people don't worship lox.

Clearly you've never been
to brunch with my cousins.

So arranged marriages, the
parents just decide...

...and then you get married?

Oh, no, no. I get a say in it. I'm sure
whoever shows up will be better company...

...than the threesome I've been having
with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi.

- Uh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

Oh, uh, these are my friends.
Uh, this is Bernadette.

- Hello.
- Uh, and this is Howard.

HOWARD: Nice to meet you.
- You too.

Please, have a seat.

[SINGSONG]
I'm thinking double wedding.

SPOCK:
Dr. Cooper.

<i>Dr. Cooper?</i>

Ls someone there?

<i>Down here. On your desk.</i>

<i>- Spock?
- I need to speak with you.</i>

Fascinating.

The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

<i>It is not the only
logical explanation.</i>

<i>For example, you could
be hallucinating...</i>

<i>after being hit on the
head by, say,</i> a <i>coconut.</i>

Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

<i>I am not going to dignify
that with a response.</i>

<i>Now to the matter at hand.</i>

<i>You need to play with
the Transporter toy.</i>

- But it's mint-in-box.
- Yes.

<i>And to open it would
destroy its value.</i>

<i>But remember, like</i> me...

<i>you also have a human half.</i>

Well, I'm not going to dignify
that with a response.

<i>Consider this.</i>

<i>- What is the purpose of a toy?
- To be played with.</i>

<i>Therefore, to not play
with it would be...?</i>

Illogical. Oh, damn it,
Spock, you're right.

I'll do it.

<i>Sheldon, wait</i>

<i>You have to wake up first.</i>

Oh, of course.

Set phasers to "Dumb," right? Ha, ha.

Goodie, goodie, goodie.

This is wrong, this is wrong. I'm
so excited, but this is wrong.

I'm gonna do it.

I'm doing it.

I did it.

[SNIFFS]

Oh.

That's what I always
thought 1975 smelled like.

One to beam down, Mr. Scott.

Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

Energize.

Aah.

Energize.

Don't be broken.

Oh. Please, don't be broken.

What did you make me do?

Okay, okay. Think.

It's only logical.

My goodness, that was delicious.

Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

Impressive.

What goes into making something
like that?

Well, you start out by trying
to make chocolate souffle.

And when it falls, you panic...

...quickly change the name,
and voila, lava cake.

I bet our parents are dying to
know how things are going here.

Well, let's see.

Yep, three missed calls.

Four missed calls, two text
messages, and a failed video chat.

- I win.
- Ha, ha.

So, what are we going to tell them?

- I'd like to tell them things are going well.
- Me too.

But before we get their hopes up...

...we should probably make
sure we're on the same page.

Okay.

What page are you on?

I'm on the one where I'm under a
lot of pressure from my parents...

...to get married and settle
down and have a family.

And I'm going to do it so
they don't find out I'm gay.

Say again?

I'm gay.

Like...

Dude-on-dude, but with women?

I know a fake marriage isn't
an honest way to live...

...but you, of all people, should
know how difficult it is to come out.

Why me "of all people"?

Well, there's a rumor back
in New Delhi that you're...

How shall we say'?

...comfortable in a sari.

- I'm not gay
- Really?

The chocolate lava cake, the
little soaps in the bathroom.

And I'm sorry, but you're
wearing more perfume than I am.

That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

And for your information, it's unisex.

Fill in the blank: "I
love the nightlife..."

- I like to boogie.
- Got you.

With women. I like to boogie with women.

That's disappointing. You were exactly
the kind of phony-baloney husband...

...I was looking for.

Thank you.

And once again, my baloney likes girls.

Wait, wait. You don't wanna put
a bite of that in your mouth...

...without trying my
homemade Chantilly cream.

Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

[GRUNTING]

Oh, dear.

Two suns and no sunscreen.

<i>Hello again, Sheldon</i>

What is it now, Tiny Spock?

<i>I am very disappointed in you.</i>

<i>You broke your toy and
switched it with Leonard's.</i>

<i>You should be ashamed of yourself.</i>

You're the one who told
me to play with it.

<i>If I told you to jump off the bridge
of the Enterprise, would you do it?</i>

No.

If I got on the bridge of the
Enterprise, I would never ever leave.

<i>Trust me, it gets old after a while.</i>

<i>You must right your wrong, Sheldon.</i>

Why? I got away with it.

Leonard has his toy, and
he's never going to open it.

So he won't know it's broken. And
I have a toy that isn't broken.

Everybody's happy

<i>Well, I am unhappy.</i>

I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

<i>I come from a factory in Taiwan.</i>

<i>Now, do the right thing.</i>

You know what you are?

Well, you're a green-blooded buzzkill.

Perhaps it's time you beam on
out of here.

<i>Fine. I will just use
the Transporter.</i>

<i>Oh, right, you broke it.</i>

Very well. Cooper to
Enterprise, one to beam up.

Energize.

[ROARS]

[SCREAMING]

Aah! Tiny Spock! Help!

- Ready for lunch?
- Yeah, one sec. Ahh.

Oh, good. Ma would've killed me if
she found out I broke my retainer.

Hey, uh, can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

Yeah, sure. How are things going?

We hit a couple of bumps.

She lives over in Manhattan Beach, so
it takes like an hour to get there.

And she's a lesbian.

What do you mean, a lesbian?

Well, you know whenever you and I
would try to hit on women in bars...

...they'd blow us off, then we'd
tell each other they were gay?

It's like that.

Except this time, it's true.

- Why did she even go out with you?
- She was looking for a husband...

...so she can appear to be straight.

And, you know, it sounded
crazy to me at first...

...but I'm actually
thinking about doing it.

Okay. Well, so the reason that might
sound crazy is because it's crazy!

Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

You know you have to make
compromises.

Yes, but my compromises are
about which bedspread to buy...

...or whose turn it is to do the
laundry, Bernadette's or my mom's.

It's a great deal. We both get
our parents off our backs.

I don't have to come home
to an empty apartment.

Plus, once I'm married, I can finally
eat carbs again and let myself go.

Why don't you tell your parents you
wanna try to find someone else?

You know, one who hasn't slept
with more women than you.

Because this one wants to marry me.

I might never find another one who does.

You're thinking about marrying someone
you're never gonna have sex with?

I can't believe your attitude.

I thought you were in favor of
gay people getting married.

HOWARD:
Yes, to other gay people.

RAJESH: Do you hear how
homophobic you sound?

[SIGHS]

Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

Nothing.

- What?
- Nothing. I said nothing.

- That was weird.
- Really? I don't even notice anymore.

Ahh, I cannot believe you guys
aren't gonna play with these.

We told you, you don't. It's mint-in-box.

I don't know. I just think it's a waste.

[SCREAMS]

Just relax, I'm just looking at the box.

You should look with your eyes and not
your muscular Nebraska man-hands.

What is your problem?

My problem is that I don't want
you to break Leonard's toy...

...which you probably did by shaking it.
She shook it, we all saw her.

Leonard, I bought you this because
I wanted you to have fun with it.

I didn't want it to sit in this box.

You know what? You're right.

I mean, it's from you.
I'm never gonna sell it.

- I'm opening it.
- Yes.

[WHIMPERS]

- It's broken.
- What?

Oh, nice job, man-hands.

I didn't break it.

I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.

Yes. Yes, he did.

That is a perfectly satisfying
and plausible explana...

You know, let's all be mad at Stuart.

I paid a lot for this. Let's
take it over there and show him.

Absolutely.

Wait.

It was me.

I opened your toy...

...discovered it was broken,
and didn't tell you.

- Why would you open mine?
- I didn't. That was a lie.

I opened my own toy...

...and it was already
broken, so I switched them.

- Well, you should talk to Stuart.
- I can't, because that was a lie.

Yours was broken in an
earthquake and that's a lie.

What is the truth?

My Mr. Spock doll came to me in a
dream and forced me to open it.

And when the toy broke, I
switched it for yours.

Later, he encouraged me to do the
right thing and I defied him.

And then I was attacked by a Gorn.

- Okay, that I believe.
- Mm.

Leonard, Penny,
I want you both to know...

...that I regret my actions towards
the two of you. That's a lie.

So is that one mine?

- Yes.
- Well, hand it over so I can open it.

Okay.

And, Leonard, even though I
don't have one anymore...

- ...I hope you have fun playing with it.
- That's a lie?

- A big, fat Whopper.
- Yeah.

I hope it breaks.

This is a treat. What brings you guys by?

Raj, Howie told me what's going
on with you and Lakshmi.

- You told her?
- I told everybody.

We believe there's someone out
there who'll love you for you.

We kind of agreed to disagree
on that one.

But we both think you
shouldn't marry this woman.

So while I'm waiting for this
mysterious perfect match...

...who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

Not necessarily.

I think we found someone
for you to cuddle with.

[RAJESH GASPS]

RAJ ESH:
Oh, my goodness.

Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever?

- You got him for me?
- Her.

We thought you two would hit it off.

I think we already have.
Thank you guys so much.

Let's go see if you fit in my man-purse.

Metrosexual, my ass.

[English - US - SDH]

So I got the craziest e-mail
this morning.

I don't mean to burst your bubble, but
penile-enlargement pills do not work.

Believe me, I know.

The e-mail I got was from the
office of Stephen Hawking.

- You're kidding.
- Why?

He's coming to the
university to lecture...

...and he's looking for an engineer to
maintain equipment on his wheelchair.

That's amazing. You'll
be like his pit crew.

A word of caution, I would not do
your Stephen Hawking impression...

...in front of him.

[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING]
You're right.

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING] I suppose
that could be considered offensive.

Oh, boy.
Oh, Sheldon's going to freak out.

Yeah, he worships Hawking.

I was thinking about bringing him
along, so he can meet the great man.

- That's really nice of you, Howard.
- It's no big deal.

Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

It'll look so nice next
to the ones he's got...

...from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

Leonard, do you recall when
I said that I was going...

...to revolutionize understanding
of the Higgs boson particle...

...and you said, "Sheldon, it's 2 a.m.
Get out of my bedroom"?

Like it was 10 hours ago.
What about it?

Well, I believe I've done it.

I'm only saying "believe"
to sound modest...

...because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

- Really?
- That's incredible. Oh, here.

- Break out the math.
- Oh, okay. Let me see this.

All right, so this particle here is
the boson moving forward in time.

Now, I was thinking...

Howard, you go ahead and eat. This
isn't gonna make any sense to you.

Sheldon, I have a working
understanding of physics.

Yeah, good for you. And
don't stop working on it.

You still going to tell him...

- ...about you-know-who?
- Yep.

- Still gonna introduce him?
- Not on your life.

Please, please, please.
Let me meet Hawking.

- I told you no.
- But I said I'm sorry.

No, you said, "Would it help
if I said 'I'm sorry'?"

Well, and you never answered me.

So who owes whom an apology now?

Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

Why on earth would I want to
do something nice for you?

To go to Jewish heaven?

Jews don't have heaven.

Well, then, to avoid Jewish hell?

Have you met my mother?
I live in Jewish hell.

Howard, please.
This is Stephen Hawking.

Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

You can't be serious.

Try to put yourself in my place.

Imagine you're the sole human being...

...living on a planet populated
with nothing but dogs.

And then it turns out there's
another human being.

Hang on. Are you saying
the rest of us are dogs?

I can see you're gonna
take this the wrong way.

Let me try again.

Imagine
you're the sole human being...

...living on a planet populated
with nothing but chimps.

Get out of my lab.

Oh, now, they're so
much smarter than dogs.

Have you seen them on
those little bicycles?

Get out!

- How about dolphins?
- Out!

So come on, how was the
first day with Hawking?

It was great. We talked about movies.

Oh.

- I showed him some card tricks.
- Oh.

He even let me read a couple
pages from his new book.

Oh...

Something got you down there,
bunky?

Howard, please, I'm begging you.

Raj, you're our group historian.
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

Three times.

He begged the Fox network
not to cancel Firefly.

He begged the TNT network
to cancel Babylon 5.

And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl parade...

...he begged a deity he doesn't
believe in to end his life quickly.

Do you understand how
important Hawking is to me?

When I was 6 years old, I dressed
up as him for Halloween.

- You're kidding.
- No, sir.

No, I took my dad's desk chair,
attached a Speak & Spell to it...

...and made my sister push me up and
down the block to trick-or-treat.

Granted, most people thought I was
R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.

You don't seem to be understanding
the English word "no."

Maybe a different language will help.

<i>Russian: Nyet. Chinese: bu. Japanese: iie.
Klingon: qo'.</i>

Binary coded ASCII:
0110111001101111.

- It's actually 011011110...
- No!

I'm not asking for me.

I'm asking for Hawking.

Let me try gangster: Hells no.

Okay, look. How about this?

You just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

If he sees the breakthrough I've
made, he'll reach out to me.

- What if he doesn't?
- Yeah, he will. He's really smart.

That's an interesting idea.

Why don't you give me a minute
to talk it over with my friends?

- How?
- Walk away.

Walking away!

You do realize
you own his ass right now.

I do.

You can make him
do anything you want.

Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to figure
out how much I wanna punish him.

Well, don't be too mean.

Hey, I'm thinking about making...

...freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

- I wouldn't mind a glass.
- I wasn't talking to you.

Bring him to his bony knees.

Sheldon, come on back.

Yes, yes!

What did you decide?

I'll give your paper to Hawking.

Great. Thank you. Oh, that's terrific.

But in exchange, I'd like you
to do a few things for me.

What kinds of things?

Are you familiar with the
12 labors of Hercules?

Of course.

You should be so lucky.

All right. What would you
like me to do first?

Well, I thought I'd start you off
by polishing my belt buckles.

By all means. Yeah, when I was a boy,
I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

And she would entertain me with
stories about growing up in Oklahoma.

Interesting woman.

You know, she once killed a
prairie dog with a gravy boat.

That's nice.

Whew. Heh.

That's a lot of belt buckles.

Funny thing is I only have one belt.

Anyway, I'll let you get started.

Oh, by the way, the little marks
that look like water spots...

...I tend to stand too
close to the urinal, so...

What you're seeing there
is splash-back.

You make sissy on your belt buckles?

Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

Here is a black light to check them.
For your own peace of mind...

...you might not wanna shine that
around the rest of the room.

Sheldon, these look great.

I mean, they're like
magnificent little crowns...

...to hang over my
magnificent little jewels.

How did you get them so shiny?

Oh, I buffed them with Turtle Wax.

The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on...

...the urine should just
bead up and roll right off.

Way to go the extra mile.
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

Now will you give Professor
Hawking my paper?

Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay.

Next, this is a sexy French maid
costume I bought for Bernadette.

I thought it might spice things up...

...and get her to dust my
room at the same time, heh...

...but I was wrong and really wrong.

You want me to return it for you?

<i>[IN FRENCH ACCENT] No, no,
no, ma petite chÃ©rie.</i>

What are you all staring at?

You ever seen a man try to get a
meeting with Stephen Hawking before?

[LAUGHING]

- Hey.
- Hello.

It's not Saturday night. Why
are you doing your laundry?

This is not my laundry.

Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy.
Good for her.

- Those are Howard's.
- Eww.

Why are you washing
Howard's man-panties?

Because if I don't, he won't give
my paper to Stephen Hawking.

- He's a famous physicist...
- Yeah.

I know. He's the wheelchair
dude who invented time.

Close enough.

Why doesn't Howard just
introduce you to the guy?

Because he's punishing me for being
a, quote, "condescending jerk."

You don't think I'm condescending,
do you?

- Well...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

- Condescending means...
- I know what it means!

And, yes, you love correcting
people and putting them down.

Au contraire, when I correct
people, I am raising them up.

You should know. I do it
for you more than anyone.

Come on, you do it to feel superior.

I see that twinkle when someone
says "who" instead of "whom"...

...or thinks the moon is a planet.

Or Don Quixote is a book
about a donkey named Hotay.

See? There it is. There's that twinkle.

Well, I can't help it. That's
an involuntary twinkle.

What do you want me to tell you,
Sheldon?

I want you to tell me that Howard
is being mean to me for no reason.

Fine. Howard is being mean
to you for no reason.

I knew it.

[GROANS]

- What's the matter?
- Every time I spend the night...

...your mom slaps me on the
behind and says, "Go get 'em."

It's not her fault. She's getting
hormone-replacement therapy.

Makes her crazy horny.

Check this out. I got Sheldon to
wear the French maid's costume.

My God, that's terrible.

What?
Hey, I gave you first crack at it.

Why are you doing that?
You're being mean to him.

He's mean all the time.

You've heard him tease me
about not having a doctorate.

You don't wanna get teased
about that, get a doctorate.

I have one. They're great.

Come on. The man torments me.

I'm letting him have a little
taste of his own medicine.

It's not the same. Sheldon doesn't know
he's being mean. The part of his brain...

...that should know is getting a
Wedgie from the rest of his brain.

Fine. I'll just make him do a
couple more things, then I'll stop.

No, you have to stop now.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Bernadette!

I wanna remind you, you promised to
take me dress-shopping tomorrow!

Oh, damn.

I'm sorry, I can't make it!

But Sheldon's gonna go with you!

And that's the last thing
you do to him.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Sheldon!

I need your help.

What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
It's this dress.

When I put my front in,
my back pops out.

When I put my back in,
my front pops out.

It's like trying to keep
two dogs in a bathtub.

What do you want me to do?

MRS. WOLOWITZ: We're gonna
have to work as a team.

Get in here, grab a handful,
and start stuffing.

SHELDON:
I'm not sure how to do this.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: It's easy. Just pretend
you're putting away a sleeping bag.

SHELDON: Sleeping bags don't
usually sweat this much, but okay.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Now zip me up.

SHELDON: Oh, if we squeeze you any
tighter, you might turn into a diamond.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You're right.

Who am I kidding?

You should've seen me when
I was young, Sheldon.

The fellas used to line up
and bring me boxes of candy.

[MRS. WOLOWITZ SOBS]

Why did I eat it all?

Would you hold me?

Oh. No, you know, I'm not
really the holding kind of...

Oh!

Oh, guys, I just remembered.

I got you some Hawking souvenirs.

What are these?

Gears and springs
from his wheelchair.

Pretty cool, huh?

[HOWARD CHUCKLES]

Wow. That's amazing.

Yeah, I made an adjustment
on the motor drive...

...and when I was putting
it back together...

...I could not for the life of
me figure out where they went.

I did it.

Had to go to three clothing stores...

...but we finally found a dress
that could envelop your mother.

I should have sent you to the
custom car cover place in Altadena.

They have her pattern on file.

Ha-ha. Humorous.

Now, will you please present
my paper to Professor Hawking?

- I don't know.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

I did your laundry. I
pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles.

I even sprained my wrist helping
your mother lift her bosom.

All right, Sheldon. There's only
one thing left I want you to do.

- Don't worry, it's an easy one.
- Okay.

Give me a compliment.

Fine.

You have very tiny hands.

No. About my job.

I want you to tell me
I'm good at what I do.

You're obviously good
at what you do.

Well, then, why are you
always ripping on me?

Oh, I understand the confusion.

No. I have never said that you
are not good at what you do.

It's just that what you
do is not worth doing.

It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me.
I'd take it and run.

Thank you, Sheldon.

Will you give my paper to Hawking?

- Sorry, I can't.
- What? Why not?

I gave it to him three days ago.

He was really impressed.

He wants to meet you.

All right, then.

Thank you, Howard.

Please let Professor Hawking know...

...that I'm available at
his earliest convenience.

- Thought he might be more excited.
- Give it a second.

[SHELDON SCREAMING]

Professor Hawking, it's an honor
and a privilege to meet you, sir.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

STEPHEN HAWKING [OVER
COMPUTER] <i>I</i> know.

I wanna thank you for
taking time to see me.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>My pleasure.</i>

<i>I enjoyed reading
your paper very much.</i>

<i>You clearly have a brilliant mind.</i>

I know.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>Your thesis that the Higgs
boson is a black hole...</i>

<i>...accelerating backwards
through time is fascinating.</i>

Thank you. It just... It came to
me one morning in the shower.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>That's nice.</i>

<i>Too bad it's wrong.</i>

What do you mean, "wrong"?

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>You made an arithmetic
mistake on page two.</i>

<i>It was quite the boner.</i>

No, no. But that can't be right.

I don't make arithmetic mistakes.

<i>Are you saying I do?</i>

Oh, no. No, no, of course not.

It's just, I was thinking... Oh, gosh, golly.
I made a boo-boo.

And I gave it to Stephen Hawking.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>Great. Another fainter.</i>

[English - US - SDH]

[LAUGHS]

I wish you could all be inside my head.

The conversation is sparkling.

Fine, I'll tell you.

A lichen is an organism made up of two
separate species, fungi and algae.

If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?

Hint, there is a right answer.

None of you will get it.

Okay. Um, I'd pick swan because,
uh, the resulting hybrid...

...would have the advanced industrial
civilization of a human...

...and the long, graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having.

Wrong. Leonard?

Horse. But mostly just for the height.

A little bit for the genital girth.

Wrong. And let's keep it clean, shall we?

Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a kangajew...

...the first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

Also, instead of just living in your mother's
house, you could live inside her body.

[LAUGHING]

Clever, but also wrong.

No. The best organism for human beings
to merge with is the lichen itself.

That way you'd be
human, fungus and algae.

Triple threat.

Like three-bean salad.

Give me one circumstance
that would be useful.

All right, picture this. A
beautiful outdoor concert.

Now, as a human,
I appreciate Beethoven.

As a fungus, I have a terrific view
growing out of a towering maple tree.

And no thank you expensive
concessions because as an algae...

...I'll just snack on this sunlight.

- He got us again.
- No, he didn't.

Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should
talk about Howard's bachelor party.

Seems like a bit of a letdown after
our lichen conversation, but...

What do you know? You're half-swan.

I did some research on strippers.

One agency said they can
get us a great price...

...if we're flexible on age
range and number of limbs.

Sounds like loads of fun, but I
promised Bernadette no strippers.

Heh, you don't want strippers?
You're the king of strippers.

That one club in North Hollywood
named a pole after you.

What can I tell you?

- I'm not into that stuff anymore.
- Good. I'm proud of you.

You're the first of us to get married.
We have to do something special.

Germans have an interesting
pre-wedding custom...

It's probably not for me.

Maybe we can go up to, uh, Napa Valley.
They've got that wine train...

Boo, wine. But, yay, trains. I'm in.

Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

You travel through the vineyards, there's a
tasting on board, and all the wildflowers...

...are in bloom. It's magic.

Look at that. In 30 seconds, we went
from hiring women to being them.

So I hear you and the lost boys are
having a bachelor party tonight.

Yeah. Just going to a restaurant, get some
steaks, Scotch. Nothing to worry about.

Why should I worry?

It's a bachelor party. There could be strippers.
Wouldn't that make you jealous?

Uh, come on, Leonard, it's you.
What's gonna happen?

If there was a stripper, all you'd do...

...is avoid eye contact and maybe offer
to help her kid with his homework.

Hey, I'm a young man
in his sexual prime.

Under the right conditions, I am
capable of just really crazy stuff.

Really? What is the craziest thing
you've ever done with a woman?

The time we had sex in the
ocean does not count.

Oh, come on, that's gotta count.

There was a really strong undertow.
We could've died.

Well, have fun tonight.

Oh, I will. There is no
telling what might happen.

Yeah, there is, heh.

You know, there's nothing wrong helping
some woman's kid get through their SATs.

I gotta hand it to Raj. He found a really
nice spot to have a bachelor party.

It's not bad. Unless you compare it to a train.
And then it stinks.

- Are you drinking whiskey?
- Indeed.

If I'm to participate in the social
convention that is the stag night...

...then I must embrace
all its components...

...including tobacco, swear
words and, yes, alcohol.

Jeepers, that's yucky.

Whoa, it's a little early to start
dropping J-bombs, don't you think?

- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. Nice of you to make it out for Howard.

It was either this or another hot
tub party at George Takei's house.

I'm confused. I thought
since our reconciliation...

...I was your friend in this group.

- Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.
- Oh.

I guess you're just friends with anybody.

Agh!

Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little
tight at the comic book store.

I might need some help covering
my share of the check.

Oh, yeah. No worries.

- And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
- Oh, all right.

- And gas money to get home.
- Yeah, sure.

You know what, this is my
grandfather's watch...

- Oh.
- ...18-karat gold.

- Got it in Europe during the war.
- Wow, it's very nice.

Mm-hm. A hundred bucks and it's yours.

Hey, everybody, the
bachelor boy has arrived.

[ALL LAUGH]

<i>ALL [SINGING]: For he's
a jolly good fellow</i>

<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

Yes, yes, yes, he's a jolly good fellow.
What time do the strippers arrive?

Actually, Barry, we're not
gonna have strippers tonight.

Ugh, then what the frig did I
get $200 in singles out for?

You wanna buy a watch?

This is maid of honor,
Amy Farrah Fowler...

...bringing you the wedding activities
just weeks out from the big day.

Let's check in with a beautiful,
radiant young woman...

...and her friend who's
about to get married.

Ladies, can you tell us
what you're doing?

Um, these are gift bags we're gonna
put in the hotel rooms of our guests.

This is a map of Pasadena, this
is a list of local restaurants.

Then for Howie's relatives, we
have antihistamines, antacids...

...and medicine for
diarrhea and constipation.

Ha, we labeled them "stop" and "go."

AMY: All right, pivoting
to the big question.

Bernadette, on your wedding night,
you'll be consummating your marriage.

What do you think your first sexual
position will be as husband and wife?

Amy, please.

AMY: Keeping in mind that whoever's on
top may set the tone for the marriage.

Okay, show's over.

Hey. They may conceive a child
on their wedding night.

Don't you think the kid might get a
kick out of knowing how it happened?

I don't care. Ask her things like,
"Are you gonna take Howard's name?"

Not "Who's gonna sit on who?"

I've been thinking I'm gonna hyphenate.

Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

Nice. You should totally get Bernadette
Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.com...

...before someone snaps it up.

Howard already took care of it.

He set up our beautiful wedding
website with cute facts...

...about our family histories.

For a while in Poland, my family
and his family were neighbors.

- Oh, that's cool.
- No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.

[ALL LAUGHING AND BELL RINGING]

May I have your attention, please?

We are here tonight to celebrate the
upcoming nuptials of my best friend...

...Howard Wolowitz.

ALL:
Hear, hear.

And apparently Wil Wheaton's
best friend.

- Sheldon.
- Talk to the hand.

Does anyone have any words they'd like
to say about our man of the evening?

I do.

[ALL GROAN]

As is the tradition, I've prepared a series of
disrespectful jokes which generate humor...

...at Howard's expense. Prepare
to have your ribs tickled.

[CLEARS THROAT]

Howard, I always thought you'd be the
last one of us to ever get married...

...because you are so short
and unappealing, am I right?

Let's see here. Oh, seriously, though...

Howard, you're actually one of the
most intelligent people I know.

And that's a zinger because you're not.

I've always thought that you'd make
someone a fine husband someday.

Assuming you'd get the parts and
develop the engineering skills...

...to assemble them, which I
don't see as likely. Hot-cha!

[LAUGHING]

Okay, let me see. Okay, kidding aside.

Howard, you are a good friend and
I wish you nothing but happiness.

Buzzinga, I don't.

- Sheldon.
- Double buzzinga. I do.

Good luck following that.

So Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Ha, ha.

Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind.
He was a wild one.

But I guess we all kind of were.

I remember this one time, I was
with this girl at the beach.

We were in the ocean and
we started making out.

I know, it was crazy.

I wasn't even wearing my aqua socks.

- Then...
- Nobody cares, Hofstadter, wrap it up.

Right. To Howard.

ALL:
To Howard!

I totally had sex in the ocean.

Okay, I'll go.

Howard, when I think about
you and Bernadette...

...starting this wonderful life together...

...I can't help but get a
little choked up. I mean...

...look at you, you have everything.

Look at me. I'm 37...

...I sleep in the back
of a comic book store...

...and I have the bone density
of an 80-year-old man.

[WHISPERS] To Howard.

ALL: To Howard.
- Yes.

- Uh, who's next?
- I'll go.

Howard, I'm gonna say something to
you that everybody is thinking...

...but no one has the
courage to say out loud.

When you invite a man to a bachelor party,
the implication is there will be strippers.

Maybe not completely nude...

...but at least pasties and
G-strings, that's not unreasonable.

- Hear, hear!
ALL: Hear, hear!

Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh?

No? Okay.

It all comes down to me as the best man.
Ha-ha-ha.

Ooh, this grasshopper is kicking
my ass-hopper. Ha-ha-ha.

Okay, when I first came to this
country, I didn't know how to behave...

...or how to dress, or what was cool.

I was pretty lonely. But then I met
Howard, and suddenly my life changed...

...because we could be lonely together.

This man became my whole world.

Yeah. Nice speech, Francine.

I'm not done, but thank you.

I think back...

...to all the good times we had,
like, uh, when we went camping...

...and spent that night telling
each other all our secrets.

I told him I'm addicted to pedicures...

...and he told me he lost his
virginity to his cousin.

[ALL LAUGHING]

She was my second cousin.

And the first woman you ever
disappointed sexually. Bada-buzzinga!

Oh, yeah. And then there was the time when
Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas...

...and paid a hooker to
pretend she was Jewish...

...and that she wanted his
little kosher pickle.

Of all the "Howard humping hooker"
stories, that one's my favorite.

Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.

Oh! Oh.

Oh, what about that tubby girl in the
Sailor Moon costume at Comic-Con?

Don't remember. Please sit down.

The only threesome I've
ever had in my life...

...and I'm proud to say it was
with this man right here!

[ALL LAUGHING]

- Please shut up.
- Oh, oh.

Don't get me wrong, nothing
happened with me and Howard.

There was about 200 pounds
of Sailor Moon between us.

Oh, Internet, this is
so going all over you.

Jeepers, I'm drunk.

Thank you for picking us up.

There's a warning right
there on the Scotch bottle.

[IN SCOTTISH ACCENT] You cannot
be operating heavy machinery...

...after you've had a
snootful of this, laddie.

[LAUGHING]

Funny. You boys have a nice time?

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Yeah, it was great.

Low-key, like I promised.

No hanky-panky, no strippers.
Just the guys telling jokes.

That's nice.

How about you?
Did you have a fun night?

Yeah. We, uh, made gift bags, had wine...

...and then went online and saw this.

<i>RAJ [ON PHONE]: Of all the "Howard
humping hooker" stories...</i>

<i>...that one's my favorite.</i>

You know, we're not that
far from my apartment.

If you stop the car, I can walk from here.

You ain't going anywhere, Threeway.

Bernadette, listen...

You lied. You said you told me about
all the girls you've been with...

...but you never mentioned your
cousin, the prostitute or Raj.

Seriously, you don't even
have to stop the car.

Anything under 10 miles an hour and
I can combat-roll into the street.

Okay, just to set the record straight...

...I didn't hire the prostitute,
she was a gift from him.

Shame on you, Raj. That is not how
we treat women in this country.

Don't you try and blame this on him.

- Thank you.
- Zip it, pervert!

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

I'm supposed to marry
Howard in a couple weeks...

...and I'm not sure I even
know who the man is anymore.

I'm curious what's bothering you most...

...the borderline incest, the prostitute...

...or group sex with the girl
dressed as the children's cartoon.

Remember when we went over things that
would be helpful and things that wouldn't?

Right.

- And that was...?
- Not.

When I first met Howard, he
seemed so innocent to me.

Just a sweet little guy who
lives with his mother.

If that's what you like, I'll take you to the
comic book store. The place is full of them.

Wait a minute.

You set me up with Howard.

Did you know about all the
creepy stuff he was into?

Oh, a little. You hear stuff.

Why didn't you tell me?

I was gonna but I didn't think
it would go past the first date.

When it did, I thought it wouldn't
go past you meeting his mother.

Definitely not past sleeping together.
Warning signs were there.

This is really on you.

My God, I though you were my friend!

[CRYING]

[SIGHS]

[DOOR SLAMS]

I don't think that was helpful.

Hi, Bernie, it's me again.
Please call me back.

Dude, I'm so sorry.

It's not your fault, it's mine.
I did all that stuff, not you.

Actually, you did do
one of them together.

- Here.
- What is this?

You're upset. The convention is to
bring an upset person a hot beverage.

No, but what is it?

Chicken broth.

It seemed culturally appropriate.

There was a single cube of chicken
bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in.

And it's been bothering me
for the last eight years.

So as they say, two birds.

I don't know what my next move is.

Well, Howard, I don't
know much about women.

- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

I don't know much about women.

Raj, you got anything?

I've got the phone number of
the tubby girl from Comic-Con.

I'm not calling the girl from Comic-Con.

All right, more Sailor Moon for me.

I just threw up the bachelor party.

Please come out, Bernadette.
Let's talk through this.

BERNADETTE:
No, leave me alone.

You should give him a taste of his own medicine.
Have a cousin you find attractive?

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

Amy.

Hey, you introduced her to the sleazebag.
I'm just trying to clean up your mess.

- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

I need to talk to Bernadette.

Well, I don't think she wants
to talk to anyone right now.

All right. Well, could you
at least give her a message?

Yeah, sure, I guess.

Tell her I'm really sorry.

And if she doesn't want
to marry me, I get it.

But what I really want her to know is
that the guy that she's disgusted by...

...is the guy that I'm disgusted by too,
but that guy doesn't exist anymore.

He's gone.

And the reason is because of her.

So...

...if this relationship is over...

...let her know that she
made me a better man...

...and tell her thank you.

Oh, my God, Howard.

That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

And it came out of you.

Howie.

Penny has a message for you.

I heard.

Your voice, not unlike your
mother's, travels through walls.

Do you want me to go?

No.

Come here.

- I'm still really mad at you.
- I get that.

Anything else about your
past I should know?

Couple of things, but most of them
happened overseas. I'll tell you later.

Okay.

So is the wedding still on?

Yeah, the Wedding's still on.

[LAUGHING]

Thank God, I'm still a maid of honor.

Oh, what the hell?

AMY:
This is kind of hot.

Hello.

What's with the robe?

I'm going to have sex with you right
here right now on that washing machine.

No, you're not.

Come on, please?

You wanna do something, you
can help me fold this sheet.

Folding a sheet in my underwear...

...still pretty crazy.

[English - US - SDH]

[PHONE RINGS]

- Howard Wolowitz.
- DAVE [OVER PHONE]: <i>Hey.</i>

<i>Dave Roeger, here, at NASA. We need
to talk about your upcoming mission.</i>

Yes, yes, I've been doing
my push-ups.

I'm still stuck at nine, but...

That's going all the way down
with no one holding me, heh.

DAVE [OVER <i>PHONE]: That's great,
uh, but that's not why I called</i>

<i>We've run into a bit of a snafu.</i>

<i>Your Soyuz capsule failed
the pressurization test...</i>

<i>...so bottom line, the
mission's been scrubbed.</i>

You're kidding.
So, what does that mean?

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh, heh.

Boy, I gotta tell you,
I'm really disappointed.

This was my dream ever
since I was a little kid.

Okay, uh... Thanks for the call.

Yeah, you too.

Yes! Thank you!

[LAUGHING]

Oh, I'm not gonna die in space!

Phew, I'm gonna die the way God intended.

In my late 50s with a
heart full of pastrami.

SHELDON:
I'm going to need a larger shirt.

This one's a little tight under the arms.

Okay.

Maybe it's tight because
you're wearing long underwear?

Yes, of course that's why it's tight.

Let me rephrase the question.

- Why are you wearing long underwear?
- You're kidding.

Shouldn't the question be,
why aren't you?

No, it should be, why are you?

Leonard, these rental tuxedos...

...have been worn by hundreds
of sweaty strangers.

I don't like my own
sweat touching my skin.

How do you think I feel about theirs?

- Why don't you slip this on?
- Said the hangman offering a noose.

Heh, well, that wasn't as entertaining
as when he rents bowling shoes...

...but it was right up there.

Well, that's it. My orders
have been rescinded.

I am officially "no go" to space.

I'm sorry, Howard, but I gotta tell you,
I'm a little relieved you're not going.

- Why?
- Come on.

You were gonna go in a rocket designed
in the 1960s by the Russians.

Yeah, so?

When was the last time
you heard someone say:

"Ooh, check out this Blu-ray player. It
must be good, it was built in Russia"?

Well, their technology isn't that bad.

When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz
capsule, you free-fall from space...

...at 500 miles per hour, and the
only thing that slows you down...

...is a parachute that pops out
before you crash into the ground.

The thing was designed by
the same brilliant minds...

...who were unable to capture
<i>Rocky</i> and Bullwinkle.

All right, well, whatever.
I wasn't worried.

You weren't?

Okay, let me explain the
difference between you and me.

You watch Star Trek, I live it.

Oh, I don't remember the
episode of Star Trek...

...where the guy never goes to space
and brags about it in a tuxedo store.

Make all the jokes you want, but
there's only one of us brave enough...

...to almost do what I almost did.

SHELDON:
Ah, much better.

You must be burning up.

A little. But not more than
your urethrae will be...

...after whatever's in
those pants swims up them.

Well, I cut quite the dashing
yet hygienic figure, don't I?

I look like the Flash
about to get married.

Oh, a tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!

Uh, where's he going?

He keeps emergency Purell
in the car.

Keys. Keys. Keys.

- Hey, you.
- Before I come in, you should know...

...I have gas.

For the record, not your
worst opening line.

Check it out. It's the gas I use in
my laser to support high voltages.

But it also has an
interesting secondary use.

Here. Breathe this in.

But before I do it, if you're a
cop, you have to tell me, right?

- Just try it.
- Okay.

[IN DEEP VOICE] What's it supposed to...?
Oh, my God, that is so freaky.

[LAUGHS]

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

[IN DEEP VOICE] You're a
mean one, Mr. Grinch.

[PENNY LAUGHS]

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Again. Me, me. Okay.

[LEONARD LAUGHS]

[IN DEEP VOICE]
Leonard, I am your father.

[BOTH LAUGH]

[IN NORMAL VOICE] I have never
been more attracted to a woman...

- ...who sounds like a man in my life.
- Aw, heh.

Mm.

[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hey, you know how
we've been taking things slow?

LEONARD:
Mm-hm.

Well, I've been thinking...

...and maybe I'm ready to
take things a little faster.

- Oh, great.
- Mm-hm.

And I promise, after waiting four
months, fast is what you're gonna get.

Just... Just one thing. We're
in a great place right now.

I don't wanna do anything that
will make stuff weird again.

- So we won't let it get weird.
- Okay.

Oh, just a heads up. Mm. Since the
last time you saw me naked...

...I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

The acceptable responses when you
see it are "awesome" or nothing.

What about...

[IN LOW VOICE]
...cookies.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

[KNOCKING ON DQOR]

SHELDON:
Amy. Amy. Amy

Seven o'clock. Right on time.

It's not an accident.

I waited outside your door
for 20 minutes.

Well, dinner's almost ready.

I must say I was surprised you chose to
spend our date-night in your apartment.

Well, as I mentioned, uh...

...the Pasadena City Council is
debating longer crosswalk times...

...and later, the Lego store is
having a Midnight Madness sale.

You ask anyone, that's a hot date.

Tempting choices, but I have something
special planned for tonight.

What can be more special than having
an adequate amount of time...

...to cross the street on your way
to buy a tiny Lego Indiana Jones?

With our friends moving
forward in relationships...

...I have decided we should
make progress in ours.

Oh, dear Lord.

Two years ago, we didn't
even know each other...

...and now I'm in your
apartment after dark.

How much faster can this thing go?

Had a feeling you'd be reluctant...

...which is why I'm going to
dip into my bag of tricks.

Oh, heh, you brain-monkeys kill me.
Dip away.

I have devised an experiment that I
believe will increase your feelings...

- ...for me in an accelerated time-frame.
- Well, how do you propose to do that?

Uh, I hope you're not thinking about
some sort of LSD thought-control.

There's only one mind-expanding
drug that this man enjoys.

And that's called school.

Human beings form emotional
attachments as they grow up.

In your case, to your mother,
superheroes, et cetera.

I'm going to attempt an experiment...

...that will get you to
transfer those feelings to me.

Well, seems what's on
the menu tonight...

...is malarkey with a
big side of poppycock.

We'll see. Let's start with a little
romantic dinner music, shall we?

[SUPER MARIO BROTHERS THEME
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

- The "Super Mario Brothers" theme?
- Yes.

I see what you're doing. You're
attempting to build on the work...

...of Ebbinghaus by triggering
an involuntary memory...

...of me playing that game.

Admittedly the happiest 600
hours of my childhood.

- But it won't work.
- Fine.

There's no reason we can't have a lovely dinner.
Why don't you have a seat?

[SHELDON IMITATING
MARIO THEME SONG]

- May I offer you something to drink?
- You know I don't drink.

Not even Strawberry Quik?

I love Strawberry Quik.

It's my favorite pink fluid...

...uh, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.

Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely
with what I have prepared for dinner.

Spaghetti with little pieces
of hot dog cut up in it.

- Just like your mommy used to make.
- Oh.

Yummy, yummy...

Yeah, we should do this more often.

Uh-oh.

I'm sorry, I did. I crossed a line.
I didn't mean to!

Who says that
right in the middle of sex?

I don't know. It just came out.

People say weird things
during sex all the time.

- Well, they sure as hell don't say that.
- It was the heat of the moment.

No, the heat of the moment is,
"Yeah, just like that"...

...not, "Will you marry me?"

- I'm sorry, just give me another chance.
- So you can crawl under covers and go:

"Hey baby, wanna go look for houses
in neighborhoods with good schools"?

Again, I'm sorry. With Howard and
Bernadette getting married...

...I got caught up in a
little wedding fever.

I take it back.

You can't take something like that back.
What are we supposed to do now?

Okay, at some point, we'll look back
and this is going to be a funny story.

Why don't we just start
doing that now?

- You're kidding.
- No.

Hey, do you remember...

...that time when I proposed
to you in bed, heh?

And you were all, like,
"What are you doing"?

[CHUCKLING]

That was so funny.

So funny.

- It's not funny.
- Just give it a minute.

Is that a little smile I see there?

I should go.

Hey, I was thinking, for our
first dance at the wedding...

...what if we learn the final
number from <i>Dirty</i> Dancing?

- You're kidding.
- No, come on.

How cool would that be? Me
running into your arms.

You lifting me up into the air.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?

I'm marrying the girl of my dreams...

...and finally got my mother to
agree not to come on our honeymoon.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

[PHONE RINGS]

Oh, hang on.

Oh, it's NASA.

Wolowitz.

Oh, hi, Dave. What's up, heh?

No kidding. Really, heh?

Well, that's great news.

Great, great news.

All right, I'll watch my
e-mail for the details.

Okay, talk soon.

What's so great?

It looks like I'm going
into space after all, heh.

Howie, that's wonderful.

Uh-huh, wonderful.

Yay!

What happened? I thought
they cancelled your mission.

They... They did. But NASA
really wants my telescope...

...up on the space station, so they're
putting me on an earlier launch.

When?

A week from Friday.

What? We're getting married
that Sunday.

You're right, heh. I... I can't go to space.
I have to get married...

...and no one can say that's not a good reason.
I'll call him back.

Wait. I don't wanna be the
one who stands in your way.

Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal.
But I forgive you.

No. That's not how I wanna
start our marriage.

Killing your dream? We'll have
the wedding when you get back.

Yeah, but what about all
the plans and the guests?

We'll call them.

Although my dad's gonna go a little
nutso over losing his deposits.

You're right, he is.

Your dad's gonna be furious.

There's no way he's gonna let
us postpone this wedding.

Well, we tried.

I'll talk to him. He won't say
no to his little girl, heh.

No, I... I should talk to him.
You know, man to man.

Howie, my dad can be a bully.

He's gonna make you cancel
your flight.

Yeah, we can only hope,
heh, that he doesn't.

Bishop to queen four, level two.

- Check.
- Sheldon, Knight takes Bishop.

You all right?

I'm fine.

Are you? You left your queen
exposed from above...

...trapped your knight in the corner,
and you keep sighing and saying:

Why me?

[SIGHS]

Very well.

Can I ask you a question
about women?

We got you that book last year.
Wasn't everything in there?

No. I'm having a relationship
problem with Amy.

And by the way, that
book gave me nightmares.

If it makes you feel any better...

...I screwed things up
pretty good with Penny.

Look at us, Leonard.

Engaging in the social convention of men
bellyaching about their old ladies.

I guess we are. So...

What's going on?

Believe it or not, Amy has
embarked on a campaign...

...to increase my feelings
for her by making me happy.

I'm sorry, that must be
very difficult for you.

It's awful. This morning...

...she arranged for me to be an
Amtrak Junior Conductor for the day.

It's usually only open to children.
She got them to make an exception.

Shame on her.

They let me blow the whistle,
Leonard.

She's good.

I know. And it gets worse.

Her efforts are causing me to have
affectionate feelings for her...

...at inappropriate times.

You mean like in bed
or in the shower?

No. And would you please stop
referencing that infernal book?

For example, this morning...

...I was calculating the random motion
of virtual particles in a vacuum...

...when suddenly, the particles morphed
into an image of Amy's dandruff...

...gently cascading down onto her
pale, slightly hunched shoulders.

[SHELDON GROANS]

What has that vixen done to me,
Leonard?

How do I make it stop?

Well, if you had a physical relationship,
I'd say propose during sex.

Turns out that's a real mood-killer.

- I assume we're talking about you now?
- Yeah.

So that's how this works? I
complain and then you complain...

...and no one offers any solutions?

Pretty much.

Well, no wonder the women
are winning.

Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?

Just looking at some old pictures.
Come on in.

Family pictures, or...? Holy
crap, that's a dead person.

Last murder case before I retired.

How many bodies do you see there?

Careful. It's a trick question.

- I'm not sure.
- No, you'll never get it. It's a fraction.

How about that, heh.

Anyway, sir, I need to talk
to you about something.

Walnut?

No, thank you. I'm allergic.

Oh, sure. My partner used to have that.
He's dead now.

- From nuts, heh?
- No, his wife shot him.

But she was nuts. So in a way...

Nice story. Anyway...

...the reason I wanted
to talk to you is...

...NASA has moved up my launch to
the International Space Station.

- Yeah, so?
- So the date is going to conflict...

...with me marrying your daughter.
Now, I know what you're going to say.

I made a commitment to
Bernadette and to your family...

...and I've got a lot of nerve coming
here and demanding that we postpone this.

Well, message heard and understood.
Mission cancelled. Thank you.

Where are you going?

I'm sorry.

May I be excused?

No, you may not. Let
me tell you something.

When I first met you... You
just gonna stand there?

I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Is this going to...?

Well, I should sit... May I be seated?
I'll just sit.

When I first met you, I didn't like you.

I'm aware of that, sir.

But then you and I
had some time together.

Uh-huh, heh.

It did not get better.

Right, right, heh.

That silly Beatle haircut.

You riding around on a red Vespa.

And you're still living
at home with your mother.

To be honest, I thought Bernadette
chose you to punish me.

But then I heard about
your astronaut thing...

and I realized I judged you too fast.

Maybe you are the right
guy for my little girl.

Oh, I am. And just so you know
I'd still be an astronaut...

...even if I didn't go to space, heh.

You know, I've got an ID
card and a NASA golf shirt.

No, no. You gotta go.

You can't turn down an
opportunity like this.

[STAMMERS]

But what about the wedding...

...and all the money you put
down for the reception?

You let me worry about that.

You go up to that space station
and you make me proud.

Um, okay.

[CHUCKLES]

You got a problem with that?

All right, look,
I'm gonna level with you.

I'm terrified about going into space.

I mean, uh,
what if I don't make it back?

It's gonna be okay, son.

- You really think so?
- Of course.

A pretty girl like Bernadette.
She'll find a new guy.

_H6Y-
_H6Y...

- Off to work?
- Yeah.

- Have a nice night.
- Okay, you too.

Penny, just wait.

I've been thinking about what
I said when we were in bed.

Yeah, I've been thinking about it too.

I noticed you never answered me.

You're right.

No.

- Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
PENNY: Yep.

- Is it still weird because I proposed?
PENNY: Yep.

I have a couple more
quick questions.

- Do you wanna call me from the car?
PENNY: Nope.

I played that pretty well.

[MEDICAL TRICORDER BEEPING]

Hello, Leonard.

- What are you doing?
- We're playing doctor.

<i>Star Trek style.</i>

I'm in hell, Leonard.

Don't stop.

[MEDICAL TRICORDER BEEPING]

[English - US - SDH]

ANNOUNCER: Previously:
- Who says that in the middle of sex?

I don't know. It was the
heat of the moment.

No, the heat of the moment is,
"Oh, yeah, just like that."

Not, "Will you marry me?"

NASA really wants my telescope
up on the Space Station...

...so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

- When?
- A week from Friday.

What? But we're getting
married that Sunday.

You're right. I can't go to space.
I have to get married.

No one can say that's not a good reason.
I'll call them back.

- Have the wedding when you get back.
- Your dad's gonna be furious.

There's no way he's gonna let us
postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.

I'll talk to him. He won't
say no to his little girl.

No, I... I should talk to
him, you know, man-to-man.

All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm terrified about going into space.

You know,
what if I don't make it back?

It's gonna be okay, son.

You really think so?

Of course.

A pretty girl like Bernadette?

She'll find a new guy.

MAN [IN RUSSIAN OVER RADIO]:

[IN RUSSIAN]

- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah?

I changed my mind.
I don't wanna do this.

- Good one.
- Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

I also have a hysterical
bit planned for later...

...where I pretend to cry
through the whole launch.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

[ALL LAUGHING]

[SIGHS]

- Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
- Two-eighty-nine...

...right between the Game
Show Network at 288...

...and the East Coast feed of
the Disney Channel on 290.

I love his eidetic memory. It's so sexy.

Sheldon, what are the
ingredients in Pringles?

Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,
corn flour, wheat starch...

...maltodextrin, salt, and my
favorite ingredient of all...

...uniformity.

The uterus quivers, does it not?

There's Howard's rocket...

- ...live from Kazakhstan.
- Oh, I'm so nervous.

I don't think I can watch.

You're nervous? I've been stress-eating
for four days. Look at me.

I'm wearing my fat pants.

Remarkable.

In just under a half hour, 200
metric tons of fuel will ignite...

...in a controlled explosion
right beneath Howard's keister.

And all from a country whose entire
contribution to the global economy...

...has been "Tetris"
and mail-order brides.

Give me those damn Pringles.

[IN RUSSIAN]

MAN [ON RADIO]:

Okay, we're in the final countdown.

- How you doing over there?
- Good, good.

Quick question. I missed
it in the briefing.

How much urine do these suits hold?

Hey, Froot Loops, wanna
hit your fan switch?

Check.

He calls you Froot Loops because
of your very gay haircut?

No, it's because I live with my
mom and she makes me Froot Loops.

Go with gay story. People
are more accepting of that.

Actually, Froot Loops just
got married to a girl.

Congratulations.

Thanks. We decided to do
it before the launch.

You and Mrs. Loops
have a big wedding?

Not exactly.

Listen, if you don't mind, I'm
not really up for chatting.

I'm just gonna sit here quietly and
let my life flash before my eyes.

[SIGHS]

That went really quick.
Let me try it again.

Close your eyes. Put out your hand.
I got you something special.

Come on, Howard, I'm not
falling for that again.

No, here.

Oh, Howie, a little star.

It's beautiful.

Put it on me.

Okay, but I'm gonna have
to get it back from you...

...so I can take it to the
International Space Station.

That way, when I come home...

...you will have a star
that was actually in space.

[GASPS]

Oh, my God.

Take that, every guy who's
ever bought you anything.

This is the most amazing
gift I've ever gotten.

Really? If you like it that much, close
your eyes and put out your hand.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm going to the
supermarket to buy snacks for your trip!

Do you want me to get those little
boxes of Froot Loops you like?

No. When I eat Froot Loops, the
other astronauts make fun of me!

I don't wanna wait until
you're back to get married.

What?

I wanna be married to you
before you get in that rocket.

But I'm leaving in two days.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
What about Apple Jacks?!

I don't need to take cereal!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: What kind of
breakfast do you think...

...they're gonna give you in Russia?!

They invented blintzes! I'll be fine!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: They invented
the light bulb in New Jersey!

It doesn't mean they hand
them out to you when you go!

We'll have a little ceremony
with just our friends.

We'll still have the big reception
with everyone when you get back.

Wow, okay, let's get married.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You know what?!

I'll buy you All-Bran in case you
get stopped up in outer space!

We decided to go down to city hall
this afternoon, get married...

...and then have the reception
when Howard gets back.

- That's so great.
- Cool.

We know it's short notice, but
we'd love you all to come with us.

No, no, no, this is not
the wedding I wanted.

I wanna wear
my maid-of-honor dress...

...walk down the aisle with
a hundred eyes on me...

...while a string quartet plays
"The Way You Look Tonight."

That wasn't our processional music.

Well, it was gonna be mine.

Thank you for the invitation,
but I have to decline...

...because it doesn't sound
like something I'll enjoy.

Come on, it'll be fun.

That's what you said about
the <i>Green</i> Lantern movie.

You were 114 minutes of wrong.

So, what do you say, Amy?

- Can I wear my maid-of-honor dress?
- Seriously? Wear that thing to city hall?

It's all I have left. You
gonna take that from me too?

- Amy, you look great.
- I know.

Where'd you get a beer?

From that happy young couple
over there with all the tattoos.

Beautiful story. They're in rival drug
gangs and they're getting married.

Shh. No one can know.

Look at all these people in love.

Kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?

It does, indeed.

Leonard, is it awkward
being here with Penny...

...given that you
recently proposed to her?

- You proposed?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

Where'd he pop the question?
What'd you say'?

- She said no. Can we drop it'?
- It wasn't a real proposal.

- Why wasn't it a real proposal?
- He asked her during coitus.

Did you get down on one knee or
were you already there? Ha, ha!

Don't talk like that
on your wedding day.

Sorry, Ma... Bernadette. Ma... Bern...
You're my Bernadette.

- Good move telling Sheldon.
- Can't propose, can't talk to my friends.

Is there anything else
I'm not allowed to do?

All right, that's enough.
Today is not about you two.

Today is about Howard
and Bernadette and me.

Folks, can I have your attention?

It's 5:00. We're gonna
take three more couples.

The rest have to come back
on Monday.

- No.
- I got this.

Excuse me, but is there any
way you can squeeze us in?

See, I'm an astronaut and I'm
leaving for Russia on Sunday...

...so I can take a Soyuz rocket to
the International Space Station.

Yeah, me too. I'll see you there.

I can't believe we're
not gonna get married.

I'm gonna go see if the couple at the
front of the line needs a maid of honor.

So I tell my wife, "Get
a dog, don't get a dog.

I'm not walking it, I'm not feeding
it, I'm not picking up after it."

You know you're gonna wind up
walking it.

I know.

Um, shouldn't you guys be talking
about space stuff instead of dogs?

Dimitri, Froot Loops would
be more comfortable...

...if we talked about space stuff.

Okay. I'm going into space.

And when I come back, I have
to pick up a poodle crap.

Is that better?

Thanks.

You know, we could always drive
to Vegas and get married.

No, isn't that kind of tacky?

I know tons of people who
got married in Vegas.

- Are any of them still married?
- Yeah.

I mean, not to the same people,
but...

There's gotta be someplace
special we could do it.

Leonard, where did you
envision marrying Penny?

Will you shut up?

I know how to make it special.

I told you, we are not re-creating
the wedding from The <i>Sound</i> of Music.

Yes, you made that brutally
clear to me.

What I was going to suggest is...

...if you're willing to wait
until Sunday morning...

...the Google satellite
will be over Pasadena.

You can have your wedding
photographed from space.

- Whoa.
HOWARD: That's so cool.

- Way to go, Raj.
- I keep telling you.

If I wasn't an astrophysicist, I
would've been a party planner.

It was always a coin-flip.

Okay, so we know we're gonna
do it Sunday morning.

Now we need to find a good place
for the satellite to see us.

How about our roof?

- Oh, I like that.
- That's great.

Oh, my gosh.

I can't believe my maid-of-honor
dress is gonna be on Google Earth.

So we have the where
and the when...

...but we still need to figure
out who's gonna do the ceremony.

Anyone can go online and get
ordained as a minister.

I know a piercing parlor
where they'll marry you...

...and stick a wedding ring
through any body part you want.

Right, well, who's it gonna be?

I'll do it, provided I can
perform the ceremony in Klingon.

No.

What do you see in her?

[IN RUSSIAN]

Leaking? What's leaking?

Fuel. Shh.

MAN [ON RADIO IN RUSSIAN]:

There's fuel leaking and
we're still gonna go?

Don't lose your Froot Loops,
Froot Loops.

This happens a lot.

Nine times out of 10, no problem.

- What happens on the 10th time?
- Problem.

Hey, guys, before I forget, I got
you a little groomsmen present.

- Thanks.
- You didn't have to.

<i>Fantastic Four Annual Number 3
from 1965 in mint condition.</i>

The one where Mr. Fantastic and
the Invisible Girl get married.

Oh, wow.

Oh, dear.

- I was afraid of this.
- What?

While a thoughtful gift, this
comic book in this condition...

- ...is worth at least $100.
- Yeah, so?

I bought you and Bernadette
a gravy boat worth $88.

Which places me in your debt,
and I can't be in your debt...

...because someday, you might
ask me to help you move...

...or to kill a man.

I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

Well, what if it's his only way out?
I can't risk it.

Here is $12.

Now we're even. Wait, wait, wait.

I bought a card. Give me $2.

For the record, this is
why I hate gift-giving.

AMY: Who is it?
- It's the groom.

You can't come in. Bad
luck to see the bride.

Okay, fine.

Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!
I'll be right back!

BERNADETTE:
Why can't she drive herself?

She doesn't wanna sit in
her dress and wrinkle it!

So I'm gonna lay her down in
the back of my neighbor's van!

BERNADETTE:
All right, just hurry!

Okay, I'll see you later, Ma...
Uh, lovely bride-to-be!

I really gotta watch that.

Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

We're ready when I say we're ready.

[MUTTERING]

Oop. Ahem.

Okay. Now we're ready.

Ma, you wanna move your chair
over here so you can see?!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm fine where I am!
I don't wanna fall off the roof!

You'll fall through the roof
before you fall off it.

Penny?

[VIVALDl'S "SPRING"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

Your new mother-in-law
is a piece of work.

Not now, Dad.

She's got a bigger mustache than me.

Here you go.

Here you go? What am I, a football?

Like that guy could catch a football.

"Howard and Bernadette, the
five of us stand before you...

...as your friends and
newly ordained ministers."

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Loudeï¬

They all got ordained! They're
all marrying us! It's adorable!

If you wanna hear, come closer!

"Guys, when I look at the two of you
starting your lives together...

...it fills my heart...

[VOICE CRACKING]
It fills my heart..."

Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.

Okay, I'll go. Ahem.

"Howard and Bernadette...

...I know you two planned on getting
married in a big, fancy wedding.

When you're in love, it doesn't matter
where or how these things happen.

It just matters
that you have each other."

LEONARD:
Hmm.

- Problem?
- No.

I think the Reverend Hofstadter
is making an ironic connection...

...between your statement
about love...

...and your rejection of his
proposal in the bedroom.

Oh, grow up.

- Hey, I didn't say it.
- That's enough.

- Well, he started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

"Bernadette, I wanna thank you for
allowing me to be your maid of honor.

I also want you to know that I
will be happy to do it again...

...if this marriage craps out."

Thank you, Amy. Very touching.

"Howard and Bernadette...

...you are lucky enough to be
best friends who love each other.

And that's the strongest kind
of love, because at its core...

...it has kindness, patience
and respect."

Qualities that are hard to
find in people these days.

Would you like some aloe vera?

You just got burned.

All right, my turn. Ahem.

"Howard, Bernadette:"

[SPEAKING IN KLINGON]

Sheldon, I told you, no Klingon.

Fine, I'll do it in English,
but it loses something.

"The need to find another human
being to share one's life with...

...has always puzzled me.

Maybe because I'm so
interesting all by myself.

With that being said, may you find
as much happiness with each other...

...as I find on my own."

The Klingon would have made you cry.

I believe you two have prepared vows?

Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this
is going to be short and sweet.

I love you with all my heart and soul
and promise to be with you forever.

Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Speak up!

Hey, from now on, she's the
only woman who can yell at me!

Until I met you, I couldn't imagine
spending my life with just one person.

And now I can't imagine spending
one day of it without you.

ALL: By the power vested in us
by the state of California...

And the Klingon High Council.

ALL:... we now pronounce
you husband and wife.

That's ignition.

I love this part!

Me too!

I have strongly mixed feelings.

Oh, my God, it's happening.

- Did I miss it?
- No, come on in. Hurry.

[MAN SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN
ON TV]

I love that man.

Me too.

I can't believe it.

This whole time, a small part
of me thought he was lying.

This is it.

Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.

[MAN SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN
ON TV]

[HOWARD YELLING AND SOBBING]

[English - US - SDH]

NARRATOR:
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

ALL: We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

[CHEERlNG]

-I love this part!
-Me too!

I have strongly mixed feelings.

So Howard's really in space?

The lnternational Space Station,
250 miles that way. Heh.

Right now Howard
is staring down at our planet...

...like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

Zeus-owitz.

I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

He can look out the window...

...and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes.

His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

You know,
it's not exactly glamorous up there.

The water the astronauts drink
is made from each other's recycled urine.

Must be nice.

Nobody wants anything
that comes out of me.

-I wonder what he's doing this very second.
-Conducting experiments in zero gravity.

Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

Whatever it is,
we know his life will never be the same.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ [OVER SPEAKER]:
<i>Howard, can you hear me?</i>

I can hear you without the phone!

<i>Don't be snippy.</i>
<i>I'm just excited to talk to my baby.</i>

I'm excited to talk to you too.

So, what's this mishegas about you
<i>moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?</i>

How about calling her my wife? Heh.

<i>Wives don't take boys from their mothers.</i>

They do, that's why we marry them.

<i>I just hope l'm not dead</i>
<i>from a broken heart before you get back.</i>

Ma, please, everyone from NASA
is listening to this phone call.

<i>Good, they should know</i>
<i>what a horrible son you are.</i>

Okay, Ma, great talking to you.
Gotta go.

[SlGHS]

Well...

...space is ruined.

AMY:
This is so exciting.

Soon my upper lip will be the same
fake-blond as my beautiful best friend.

Hey, this is my natural hair color.

Now.

So does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?

Yes. According to the relationship agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date...

...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...

...and engage in casual physical contact...

...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

That's hot.

You kids better use protection.

-How long does this stay on?
-Just a couple minutes.

-You've really never done this before?
-Once in high school. But I dozed off...

...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

-So how's everything with you and Leonard?
-I don't know. It's still kind of weird.

We haven't really recovered
since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

Oh. Boo-hoo.

If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...

...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.

Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

-Interesting question. On the one hand--
-You don't even know what it is, do you?

The anthropic principle states...

...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...

...the answer is that
it must have qualities...

...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...

...who are capable of asking the question.

As l am doing so eloquently right now.

I know what the anthropic principle is.

Of course.
I just explained it to you.

Now, where do you stand on it?

-Where do you stand on it?
-Strongly pro.

Then l believe that God
created the world in six days...

...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

Raj, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

-I'm all for it.
-Thattaboy.

Why do you believe that he knows
what it is, and l don't?

Oh, Leonard...

...let's not take a saw to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

Hey, if you guys are free tonight
I heard about a spa...

...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...

...that eat the dead skin off them.

I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles...

...sandal season is year round.

-Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
-Oh, okay.

Sounds like it's me and you.

How about we sic some guppies
on those puppies?

As l've stated before
on numerous occasions...

...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...

...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."

That never gets old.

[lN DEEP VOICE]
Release the Kraken!

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Oh, chills.

Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.

Oh, okay. l'll just go home and be alone.

Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, l cry alone, so...

...cool.

Darn.

If you weren't busy I'd ask you to join us.

Really? l can come? Thanks.

Sheldon, are you sure you wanna bring Raj
on your date night?

Oh, absolutely.

I have a contractual obligation...

...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.

But nowhere is it specified
that I can't outsource that to an lndian.

BERNADETTE [ON MONlTOR]:
<i>Howie?</i>

<i>-Howie?</i>
-Hey, there's my beautiful bride.

-Can you see me?
<i>-I can.</i>

<i>-How are you?</i>
-I'm amazing.

This is even better than I dreamed.

I look out the window...

...and it's all so unbelievable.

<i>Good for you. I just had a seemingly</i>
<i>endless dinner with your mom.</i>

Oh, yeah? That's nice. Heh.

<i>It was. Until l found out you never told her</i>
<i>we're not gonna live with her.</i>

<i>Let's talk about that for a minute.</i>

Hey, look, this pen is floating. Heh.

How crazy is that?

<i>You said you told her but you never did.</i>

Okay, okay, l know you're upset...

...but let me share something
I've learned since I got here.

You realize how small
your problems are...

...when you're looking down
on them from space.

Heh. Come on,
that's gotta make you feel better.

<i>How clear is the image of me</i>
<i>on that screen?</i>

Pretty clear. Heh.

<i>Do I look like l feel better?</i>

I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.

<i>Listen, you're gonna talk to your mother</i>
<i>and you're gonna fix this.</i>

<i>Or that thing l said I was gonna do to you</i>
<i>when you got home...</i>

<i>...you can do to yourself.</i>

Like he's been doing since he got here.

[SOFT MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

Sheldon, this place is so romantic.

Aw.... l'm glad you like it. Raj picked it out.

When you see him,
tell him l say thank you.

Tell him yourself.

Yoo-hoo! Over here.

I don't understand. What's he doing here?

-I invited him.
-On our date?

Sheldon, that's not okay.

Oh. Yes, it is. There's a loophole
in the relationship agreement.

You found a loophole?

Sorry I started without you...

...I'm a little nervous.
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

I can't believe
I bleached my mustache for this.

You should go to my girl,
she'll knock out those sideburns for free.

You know, Amy, l don't think
you and l have had a real conversation.

Let's use tonight
to get to know each other better.

You start.

Go home.

-I don't understand.
-Sheldon, how could you do this?

-It's our second anniversary.
-It's your anniversary?

Oh, my God, I had no idea.

Amy, please, let me make this right.

-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Waiter?

A bottle of champagne
and three glasses.

Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?

I hope that's a rhetorical question
because l have no clue.

Mm. This is great, what's the occasion?

No occasion.
Things have been a little weird between us...

...so l wanted to throw together
a fun night for you.

-That is so sweet.
-I got your favorites:

Beer, wings, sliders, we can watch
the football game. I even painted my stomach.

-Go sports?
-Well?

In case you were in the mood for baseball,
I didn't wanna look ridiculous.

-This is awesome, l love it.
-Good, l'm glad.

I worked my ass off,
so this is what l needed.

Great, just relax and enjoy.
Tonight is all about you.

Ah. Thank you.

[CHUCKLES]

[SlGHS]

So where exactly are we
in this relationship?

Oh, come on, l just told you
I had a hard day.

-You're right, l'm sorry. Let's watch the game.
-Great.

[SlGHS]

Just know, the longer we wait
to talk about it the weirder it gets.

Sweetie, can l just be the girl tonight?

Absolutely. You're the girl, l'm the guy.

Watch your football game
while l make you a plate here.

Thank you.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

I'll get it. Go sports! Heh.

Hello-lo-lo.

I thought you were out
with Sheldon and Amy.

I was, but it's their anniversary,
and I didn't wanna be a third wheel...

...so l figured I'd hang out
with you and Penny on your date.

It's not really a great time.
Penny and l have some things to talk about.

PENNY:
No we don't, come on in!

Sweet.

I can't believe
I shaved my stomach for this.

DlMITRl:
Hey, Froot Loops.

You got a phone call.

Who is it?

A woman who says she's your mother
but sounds like your father.

[TURNS SPEAKER ON]

Hey, Ma.

You know, we could see each other
if you turn on the computer.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
<i>I'm not going near that fakakta thing.</i>

<i>I'll catch a computer virus!</i>

You can't catch a computer virus.

<i>Oh, so now you're an astronaut</i>
<i>and a doctor?</i>

What do you want, Ma?

<i>Your wife says you have</i>
<i>something important to tell me.</i>

Okay, here it is:

Bernadette and l
are starting a life together.

-And--
<i>-Oh, God.</i>

<i>You are gonna leave me!</i>

-Ma--
<i>-It's okay.</i>

<i>Your father left me, you left me.</i>

<i>I guess l'm just the kind of person</i>
<i>people like to leave.</i>

It's not definite. l'll talk to Bernadette.

<i>Don't bother.</i>

<i>I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground</i>
<i>so l'm no trouble when I die.</i>

Stop it, Ma.

I'm sure l can get Bernie to come around.

<i>I knew it! I knew she was behind this.</i>

<i>You listen to me, if you wanna be a man</i>
<i>you can't let a woman tell you what to do.</i>

Okay, okay.

I can't believe these people
won the Cold War.

Now, can we please change the subject?

<i>Fine. Explain why you've been gone so long</i>
<i>and l haven't gotten a single letter.</i>

<i>Not even a lousy postcard!</i>

[ANNOUNCER SPEAKING
INDlSTlNCTLY ON TV]

You know,
I'm growing to like American football.

-Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
-Well...

...it's not the balls-to-the-wall action
of badminton or cricket, but hey...

...what is?

Who's ready for another beer?

-I'm good.
-No, thank you.

Girls.

I am having the nicest time.

You guys are like family to me.
You know that, right?

That's great. Get out.

-What? Why?
-Penny and l have some issues to talk about.

Oh, pish on your issues.

You guys are fine.

Yes, you've had some bumps
along the way.

I mean, Penny, you've always known
how this man has felt about you.

But you made him grovel for affection.

-Okay, hold on--
-Don't blame yourself.

He was a groveler from way back.

But the point is,
the two of you got past it.

And you go and propose to this poor girl
in the middle of sex?

That was some weak tea, dude.

Some people might say it was romantic.

Yeah, no.

But yet, here you two are still together.

Even after you and l
had our crazy naked night.

PENNY: That's enough.
LEONARD: Okay.

I'm just saying...

...that after all you've been through...

...you get to look into each other's eyes
and say I love you.

And that's beautiful.

Actually, to this day
she's never really said it.

Oh, Penny, that's ridiculous!

You know you love him.
Look him in the eyes and say it.

-Raj.
-You know you want to say it. Say it.

Say you love him.

Say it!

I really thought she would say it.

Have l ever told you
you're like a sexy praying mantis?

Every time you drink alcohol.

You know, what's wonderful
about the praying mantis...

...they devour their mate.

Your point being?

Dessert is served.

I just had cobbler.

You know what?

I'm done with this.

-But where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

You can't leave, I need you.

-You do?
-Yes.

You're my ride.

Sheldon...

...you either say something meaningful
and from the heart...

...or you and l are done.

All right.

Please.

[SHELDON CLEARS THROAT]

Amy...

...when l look in your eyes...

...and you're looking back in mine...

...everything feels...

...not quite normal...

...because l feel...

...stronger and weaker at the same time.

I feel excited...

...and at the same time, terrified.

The truth is...

...I don't know what I feel...

...except l know what kind of man
I want to be.

Sheldon.

That was beautiful.

I should hope so,
that's from the first Spider-Man movie.

I'll take it.

Good.
Now, l assume we're splitting the check?

-Hey, Stuart.
-Oh, hey.

I was actually just about to close.

-Oh, I'm sorry, l'll leave.
-No, no, it's okay.

-Hang out.
-You sure?

Yeah, you're my first customer today.

All right, great.

I'm, uh, having a nightcap,
you wanna join me?

-What are you drinking?
-Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.

I call it a sad-tini.

Perfect for the night l'm having,
thank you.

-Mm. Nice not to drink alone.
-Amen to that.

Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay
into my dog's water bowl.

-You're kidding?
-He's kind of a mean drunk...

...but what you gonna do?

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

-A little music?
-Sure.

[BOSSA NOVA PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS]

Mm. Bossa nova.

You listen to that with your hips
as well as your ears.

Ahh.

Something about Latin music...

...makes me feel
like l'm on a white sand beach in Rio.

Yeah?

Sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies...

...tanned and glistening with sweat.

-I should go.
-Yeah.

-Uh, thank you for the drink.
-No problem.

[RAJ SlGHS]

-Hey, Stuart.
-Yeah?

You wanna hang out tomorrow night?

Maybe grab a bite to eat
or catch a late movie?

Yeah, l'd like to
but l'm a little tight on funds.

No problem, my treat.
I'll swing by after work.

-Okay.
-Okay.

I could do worse.

BERNADETTE: That's such good news, Howie.
<i>Thank you for telling her.</i>

Hey, I'm a grown man.
I'm gonna live with my wife.

My mother's just gonna have to learn
to make do on her own.

<i>Was she upset?</i>

Who can tell? She yells everything.

She might have been upset.

She might have been hungry.

<i>Thanks for fixing it. I love you.</i>

I love you too. Sweet dreams.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

<i>Goodnight, Rocket Man.</i>

To infinity and beyond, baby.

Loops, you realize you just lied your ass off
to your wife and your mother.

-I know.
-What are you gonna do when you get back?

Oh, I'm never going back. Heh.

[English - US - SDH]

And the next wedding gift is...

-...a gravy boat.
-Oh, one gravy boat.

That's from Sheldon.
He told me he had it engraved.

"ln the event of a divorce
please return to Sheldon Cooper."

One inappropriate...

...yet-l-wish-I-thought-of-that
gravy boat.

When I get married, I'm gonna register
at the UCLA cadaver lab.

Ew. Why?

Because l've always wanted
a whole human skeleton...

...and they are really spendy.

You actually see you and Sheldon
getting married someday?

Not just someday,
in exactly four years.

But don't tell Sheldon,
he's still a flight risk.

What about you, Penny?

What about me, what?

Do you think you and Leonard
might ever get married?

Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.

But do you think
you'll ever get married?

He's a sweetie.

You're not answering the question.

-Do you love him?
-Yes, sure, of course l love him.

-It doesn't sound like it.
-Well, I do.

-Do you tell him that?
-No, he'd just take it the wrong way.

-What does that mean?
-It means he is special...

...and smart, and nice, and--

-Are you gonna break up with him?
-No. Maybe, l don't know.

I had no idea you were unhappy.

That's the thing, l'm not.
I'm not unhappy at all.

I don't know, I've been in love before
but it felt different.

But maybe this is a new,
better, boring kind of love.

Do you ever feel
that way about Howard?

That's not really a fair comparison.

I'm basically married
to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.

Amy, you?

Can't help you.
Whenever l'm around Sheldon...

...I feels like my loins are on fire.

In the good way,
not the urinary tract infection way.

RAJESH [OVER RADlO]:
<i>Hey, buddy, how's it going up there?</i>

You don't have to shout, Raj.

It's not like I'm an astronaut
floating around in outer space.

Oh, wait, l am.

So is it everything
you hoped it would be?

It's better.
Heh, I wake up every morning...

...and I just can't believe
I'm on this incredible adventure.

Hey, Froot Loops,
did you clean the space toilet?

Excuse me, l'm talking to my friends.

You know the rules,
new guy scrubs the toilet.

If you do good job,
next time we give you brush.

[LAUGHlNG]

Funny.

We're always giving each other
a hard time up here.

It's kind of like being in a frat.

You know, joking, kidding around,
hurting feelings.

-Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
-Go ahead.

231 1 North Los Robles Avenue...

...Pasadena, California
to lnternational Space Station.

Can you read me? Over.

[MlMlCS RADlO STATlC]

Yes, l read you, Sheldon.

Copy that. Over.

[MlMlCS RADlO STATlC]

-What are you doing?
-I'm talking to a man in space.

If you don't have the...

[MlMlCS RADlO STATlC]

...he might as well be at the Coffee Bean
over on Lake Street.

You're out of your mind, Sheldon.

That's a negative.
My mother had me tested. Over.

[MlMlCS RADlO STATlC]

Come on, scrub-a-dub, Loops.

All right. All right. I gotta go.

There's a meteor shower.

Wanna see a meteor shower?

Take a look at what Dimitri
just left you in the toilet.

-Bye.
-Over and out.

[MlMlCS RADlO STATlC]

Bye, buddy!

-Hello?
-Hey, Stuart, come on in.

What are you doing here?

Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies
with you guys.

Excuse me, l didn't authorize this.

-Sheldon, you are not in charge.
-That's mighty sassy for a man...

...with a roommate performance review
around the corner.

What's the big deal?
You guys are bringing your girlfriends.

I didn't wanna sit by myself.

The big deal is, I was expecting us
to be an intimate group of five.

Now we're gonna be
a faceless mass of six.

It'll be fine.
Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.

Hmm....

-Do you like Raisinets?
-I take them or leave them.

At the movies,
Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.

Would you feel more comfortable
if l ate Raisinets?

It's hardly my business what you eat.

As long as it doesn't crunch
during the film and it's Raisinets.

Okay.

-Should we go?
-Uh, one more question.

If you're gonna replace Wolowitz,
I need to know a little more about you.

-All right.
-Wolowitz went to MIT.

What's your educational background?

-I went to art school.
-Equally ridiculous. Let's go.

[UPBEAT MUSlC PLAYlNG lN MOVlE]

This insistence on hand-holding
is preposterous.

-Well, I like it.
-Yeah, of course you do, you're a girl.

You like all kinds
of hippie-dippy things.

Just watch the movie.

It's not fair.

Penny isn't making Leonard
hold hands.

There might be a reason for that.

Sweaty...

...unhygienic...

...looks dumb, take your pick.

Penny said she's not sure she wants
to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.

Wrong. She just took a sip
from his Diet Dr. Pepper.

So?

So if she wants to end her pair-bond
with Leonard...

...why on earth would she guzzle
a witch's brew of his soda and spit?

It's complicated.

String Theory is complicated.

That's just yucky.

Don't get any ideas.

All right, for the sake of argument,
let's say that's true.

Why doesn't Penny just end
the relationship?

She's not sure how she feels.

How can she not be sure
how she feels?

You know, when l have a feeling,
I know it.

Trains? Love them.

Swordfish? l love them too.

They're fish with a sword for a nose.

Regardless, don't say anything
to Leonard.

You.... Now you're asking me
to keep a secret from my best friend...

...colleague and roommate?

Yes, please. Penny will kill me.

Oh, fine.

FYl, secret-keeping. Hate it.

Hand-holding, not a fan.

Hammerhead shark, l love that thing.

Yeah, it's another fish
with a tool on its head.

-Raisinet?
-Shh! We're trying to watch the movie.

This is not working out with him.

[KlSSlNG TEETH]

-What are you doing?
-I think I might have tartar buildup.

My tongue won't go as far forward
as it used to.

Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

Nope.

Oh, you have no idea
how annoying this is.

I'm starting to get a sense of it.

Don't worry, I'll take you
to the dentist tomorrow.

Thank you.

I appreciate that.
You're good people, Leonard.

-There's something l need to tell you.
-Okay.

I can't tell you.

Why?

I can't tell you why l can't tell you.

So I guess there's two things
I can't tell you.

I wish there were more.

Good night.

-I'm sorry, this is really important.
-What is it?

[SlGHS]

I like the Transformers.

Do you like the Transformers?

Where exactly did your mother
have you tested?

Leonard.

The Transformers teach us that things
are not always what they appear to be.

You know, like a....

A semi-truck might be an alien robot...

...or, uh, someone
in a romantic relationship...

...might feel differently
than they appear to.

Or a conversation
about the Transformers...

...might actually be about someone
in this room.

I'm gonna pause to let that sink in.

-Okay, I think l understand.
-You do?

The guy who seems like an emotionless
robot is you.

But your relationship with Amy
is causing you to transform...

...into a red-blooded man
with sexual desires.

That is literally the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

Leonard.

Leonard.

Leonard.

LEONARD:
What?

Are you sleeping?

I was, now l'm having a nightmare.

What?

Never mind. l still can't tell you.

[SOFT KNOCKlNG NEARBY]

SHELDON:
Penny.

-Penny.
-Mmm.

Penny.

[BOTH SCREAMlNG]

Oh, my God, Sheldon.

You frightened me.

What are you doing in my bedroom?

I knocked on the front door
but you didn't hear.

-How did you even get in, you weirdo?
-Yeah, yeah, really?

I've seen strange men traipsing in
and out of here for years...

...but when I do it, it's weird?

What do you want, Sheldon?

Well, I was having a little trouble
sleeping and l just thought...

...you know, seeing as you're up,
we could talk.

Talk about what?

Oh, I don't know. Uh, weather?

Uh, fish you could do carpentry with?

Why Leonard is such an attractive
and desirable boyfriend?

Pick one, your choice.

Sheldon--

Did you know that Leonard
has a perfect driving record...

...and enjoys the insurance discounts
that go along with that?

Hubba, hubba.

-Okay, go home, crazy man.
-You....

Did you know that while Leonard is not
considered a tall fellow in our country...

...in today's North Korea,
he's downright average?

Talk about a keeper.

Okay, what did Amy tell you?

Oh, very well. l can't keep up
this clever charade any longer.

She told me that you were thinking
of ending it with Leonard.

Okay, listen to me. It's really sweet
you're trying to protect your friend...

...but this is none of your business.
Got it?

Excuse me,
this is not about protecting my friend.

[PENNY GROANS]

I'm a big fan of homeostasis.

-Do you know what that is?
-Of course not.

Homeostasis refers to a system's ability
to regulate its internal environment.

Yeah, and maintain a constant condition
of properties like temperature or pH.

Worst bedtime story ever.

My point is,
I don't like when things change.

So, regardless of your feelings, l would
like you to continue dating Leonard.

And also, while we're on the subject,
you recently changed your shampoo.

I'm not comfortable
with the new scent.

Will you please stop this madness
and go back to green apple?

Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out.

And until l do,
you are not to say a word to Leonard.

-Do you understand?
-I do.

-You clear on the shampoo issue?
-Get out.

[PENNY SIGHS]

-Penny?
-What?

Please don't hurt my friend.

-That is the last thing I want to do.
-Thank you.

Coconut. What were you thinking?
Are you a hula-girl?

Out!

[PHONE RINGlNG]

-Hello?
-What the hell is wrong with you?

You told Sheldon? Do you know
what a terrible position this puts me in?

[PHONE BEEPlNG]

Hang on, please.

-Hello?
-Yeah, just a heads-up.

Penny knows that you blabbed
about Leonard. She's pretty mad.

I know. She's yelling at me right now.

All right then,
so we're all on the same page.

<i>Hey, Bernie.</i>

There's my hubby.

How's everything going up there?

<i>Oh, it's okay.</i>

<i>Space is beautiful, Earth is beautiful.</i>
<i>Same old, same old.</i>

-What's wrong?
<i>-Nothing.</i>

<i>-Everything's fine, heh.</i>
-Howard.

<i>The other astronauts</i>
<i>are being mean to me.</i>

No, what are they doing?

<i>Well, like, for instance,</i>
<i>the other day, when I was asleep...</i>

<i>...one of the guys</i>
<i>went on a space-walk...</i>

<i>...and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask</i>
<i>to the outside of my window.</i>

<i>When l woke up,</i>
<i>l screamed for like nine minutes.</i>

Oh, Howie.

<i>You can see it if you want.</i>
<i>It's on YouTube.</i>

<i>Google "Astronaut screams</i>
<i>for nine minutes."</i>

Why don't you stand up to them?

<i>What am l supposed to say?</i>

I don't know.

Say, "Being mean is lame.

What's cool is being nice."

<i>Great, I'll do that when I wanna</i>
<i>be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.</i>

Do you want me to call somebody
at NASA?

<i>No, my mom already tried that.</i>
<i>It only made things worse.</i>

Gelatinous Sphere.

Focused Locust.

Temple of Yip.

I'm sorry,
Wolowitz would never play that card.

All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.

Fairy God Monster, l win.

Your desperate need for friendship
makes you weak.

So, what are you guys doing later?

Stuart and l were thinking
of going out for a drink.

-Try to meet some girls.
-Because that's what we do, heh.

So watch out, ladies, a little coffee
and cream coming your way.

In case you didn't follow that,
I'm the coffee.

Leonard, maybe you'd like to go
with them to meet girls.

Why would l be interested?
I have Penny.

Yeah, for now.

But that woman has a death wish,
Leonard.

Yeah, she talks to strangers,
she pets unfamiliar dogs...

...and it is ridiculously easy
to break into her apartment.

If I were you, I'd get a backup.

You can't just replace someone you care
about with some other random person.

Uh, please don't ruin this for me.

Do you remember how upset l was...

...when they replaced
Edward Norton as the Hulk?

Yes, you walked around for a week...



But then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk
in The Avengers and he was even better.

-What's your point?
-Call me a romantic.

I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo
is still out there somewhere.

This is ridiculous.
Are we gonna play cards or not?

-I like Mark Ruffalo too.
-Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz.

No one likes a kiss-up.

So I had to take Sheldon
to the dentist this morning.

-Really?
-Yeah.

I told him that if he didn't bite the
hygienist l'd take him for ice cream.

I didn't have to take him for ice cream.

Uh-huh.

You okay?
You seem a little distracted.

[SlGHS]

Look,
there's something l need to tell you.

Oh, yeah, okay.

-I don't really know how to say this.
-Just say it.

-Okay, here goes....
-Mm-hm.

You slept with him?

I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes.

Oh, sure, you had no choice.

He looked at me like this.

If that's all it takes,
it's a good thing you don't have a dog.

Don't worry, you'll have plenty
of chances to break up with him.

Your wedding day, your honeymoon,
your 50th anniversary.

Look, it's fine,
we're not getting married, okay?

We're keeping things, you know,
homeostasis.

It's so cute when she tries.

[PHONE BEEPS]

It's from Leonard.

"Last night was amazing.
You're amazing.

I'm so lucky to have you in my life."

Okay, stop it.

<i>HOWARD: Hey, Bernie, guess what? l stood up</i>
<i>to the other astronauts like you said.</i>

<i>And I gotta tell you last night</i>
<i>was the first time in a week...</i>

<i>...l got a good night's sleep.</i>

[CHUCKLES]

Oh, Howie.

<i>What's wrong? You look upset.</i>

Nope.

This is my proud face.

[English - US - SDH]

HOWARD:
Hey, Bernie.

<i>Hey. How's my little astronauttie hottie?</i>

Okay, I guess.

It's just being cooped up in this tin can
for weeks on end is starting to get to me.

<i>Hang in there. You just have a couple</i>
<i>more days to go and you'll be home.</i>

-I know.
<i>-I gotta get back to work. I love you.</i>

Love you too. Hey, Bernie...

...before you go,
can you do something for me?

<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

Okay, here it is.

I really miss gravity.

Can you drop something
so I can watch it fall?

<i>Really? You're serious?</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

Oh, baby, you're killing me.

Unh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi.

This came for you today.
It's from your mom.

-Oh. Thank you, Penny.
PENNY: Mhmm.

Yeah, wait. Here.

For your troubles.

Oh, boy, a whole dollar.

Now l can quit my paper route.

So, what's in it?

Doesn't matter. Half the time,
he just ends up playing with the box.

Yeah, it's journals and research papers
I wrote as a child.

Aw. How cute.

Is this, like, a diary?

No, that's my potty-training journal.

-Really? Your potty-training journal?
-Yeah.

And forgive my crude penmanship.
I didn't start typing until I was 6.

"August 7th, 8:42 a.m.

This is humiliating.
What was wrong with diapers?"

[SHELDON CHUCKLES]

There are some charts in the back...

...where l kept track of shape,
color and consistency.

Oh!

Disgusting.

No, what's disgusting
is he's still keeping track.

-Why do you need this--?
-No, no, no.

-Sorry.
-I am glad you asked.

-Oh.
-Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?

Heh. Of course.

It is-- It's been in the news.
And it's a very famous boson.

Nice try. No, in 1 964...

...Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished
self-promoter and physicist...

...he wrote a paper
postulating the existence...

...of a subatomic particle
called the Higgs boson.

Now, initially, the paper was rejected.

But recently, he was proven right.

And now he's on the fast track
to win a Nobel Prize.

-Yeah. That's basically what l said.
-Yeah--

The point is, Higgs is being celebrated
for work he did 50 years ago.

So that got me thinking.

Perhaps l've already hit upon the idea
that will win me my Nobel Prize.

I didn't know they gave Nobel Prizes
for making boom-boom in the potty.

You really think there's some kind of
scientific discovery in here?

Well, this box only covers
my work through nursery school.

There's a good deal more to come.
I didn't really hit my academic stride...

...until I cut out that time-suck
known as playing outdoors.

You're gonna spend hours and hours
combing through all this stuff?

That's a good point.
My time is much too valuable.

Perhaps l should find someone
to do it for me.

Someone with a rudimentary
understanding of science...

...but whose real talents lie
in menial labor.

-Not gonna happen.
-Yeah, well--

If I didn't think you could handle it,
I wouldn't be asking.

If you want help, just hire a grad student.

-Maybe I could do it.
-Really.

You can assess the quality of my work?
Okay. Um, here.

I wrote this when l was 5 years old.

"A proof that algebraic topology...

...can never have a non-self-contradictory
set of abelian groups."

I'm just a blond monkey to you,
aren't I?

You said it, not me.

All right, Ms. Jensen, before we begin,
may I offer you a refreshment?

Water, coffee, tea?

A marijuana cigarette?

No, thanks, l'm fine.

Are you sure?
Everyone's smoking them.

I think they're the best.

-I don't do drugs.
-Excellent.

Yeah. That was a ruse.

They're not the best. Physics is the best.

By the way, coffee was also
an unacceptable choice.

All right, so l see here
you're from Des Moines, Iowa.

You're summa cum laude in theoretical
physics from Stanford University.

Oh, and two years ago
you had a persistent ear infection.

I hope that didn't cause
any hearing loss.

No, of course not.

How did you know about that?

Well, I did a comprehensive
background check.

Medical records, credit reports,
criminal history.

I trust you paid off
those parking tickets.

Yes, l did.

Hearing unimpaired. Good.

Look, Dr. Cooper,
I really want this position.

It would be an incredible honor
to work for a man of your brilliance.

Flattery will not get you this job,
Ms. Jensen.

It's not flattery if it's the truth.

Oh.

Well, thank you. Welcome aboard.

-Talked to Howard, lately?
-Yeah, last night.

He kept making me drop pencils
for him.

I got uncomfortable.

Hope you're hungry.
They're serving macaroni and...

[lN STRAlNED VOICE]
...cheese.

Smooth.

-Hi.
-Hello.

Aren't you gonna introduce us?

No. I have people for that now.
You're up.

I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.

Ah, congratulations,
and may God have mercy on your soul.

-I'm Leonard, this is Raj.
-Nice to meet you.

I'm so excited to be working with--

Please reserve chitchat for your breaks,
Ms. Jensen.

And FYl, there'll be no breaks.

I should probably get to work.

She seems nice.

Hey, you already got a girlfriend.
I call dibs.

-All l said was "She seems nice."
-Yeah, well, l love her.

[PHONE RINGS]

Hey, I wasn't expecting
to hear from you today.

-Everything okay?
<i>-Uh, no, not really.</i>

[SQUEAKS]

What's wrong?

<i>Well, remember the Soyuz capsule</i>
<i>they were sending to bring us home?</i>

-Uh-huh.
<i>-It's delayed.</i>

<i>We're gonna be here</i>
<i>at least another week, maybe 1 0 days.</i>

<i>It's the Russians, so you don't know.</i>

[WHlSPERS]
<i>They left dogs up here in the '60s.</i>

Come on, Howard.
No one's leaving you up there.

[lN NORMAL VOICE] I don't know how much
<i>longer I can take this. l can't sleep.</i>

<i>And zero-gravity</i>
<i>is giving me crazy acid reflux.</i>

<i>I'm down to my last three Tums.</i>

You're gonna be fine.

You survived that Weight Watchers
cruise with your mom.

And they ran out of low-fat ice cream
on day two.

Just calm down
and take a few deep breaths.

<i>Okay, okay.</i>

<i>What am l doing?</i>
<i>I'm using up all the oxygen.</i>

<i>If l die, promise you'll never have sex</i>
<i>with another man.</i>

Oh, yeah.

I'm a man-eater now.

Okay, for the final touch,
this is an eyelash-curler.

You just place it on your lashes
and squeeze it closed.

Oh. I don't know.

Looks like something
used by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.

Who I hope, for her sake,
is not Captain Hook, so....

Who you calling?

-I'm gonna video-chat Sheldon.
-Hmm.

If my new look leads to phone sex...

...I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the room.

ALEX [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Dr. Cooper's office.</i>

Oh. Hello. Who are you?

<i>I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's assistant.</i>

<i>-Can l help you?</i>
-I'd like to speak to Sheldon.

<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>he's asked me to hold all calls...</i>

<i>...unless you're Stephen Hawking,</i>
<i>his mother, or himself from the future.</i>

-All right, well, tell him Amy called.
<i>-Last name?</i>

He knows my last name.
I'm his girlfriend.

We have a contract and everything.
I'll send you a PDF.

<i>All right. I will tell him you called.</i>

-Hmm. That's weird.
-What?

Sheldon told me
he had a new assistant named Alex.

He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.

Maybe he didn't notice.

You're right.
I don't have to worry about Sheldon.

[LAUGHlNG]
No, you do not.

It's her I have to worry about.

Oh. Amy, really?
She is not gonna come on to Sheldon.

Oh, really?

Look at this face.

How can any woman spend eight hours
a day alone with this face...

...and not fall in love with it?

Well, for starters, at some point,
that face starts talking.

Amy, this is crazy.
You have nothing to be suspicious about.

I'm not suspicious.

I just wanna stop in, say hi to my boyfriend,
and meet his new assistant.

Aha!

-Can we go now?
-Hang on.

-What are you doing?
-Isn't it obvious?

I'm spreading my scent
to mark my territory.

Come on, Amy,
that is not gonna work.

Really? Because just before
you became my best friend...

...I did this all over your apartment.

Has your assistant
said anything about me?

Oh, in fact, she has.

Her exact words were
"What is that guy's problem?"

I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.

Here's your frozen yogurt, Dr. Cooper.

This should be fun.

Half chocolate, half vanilla,
side by side, not swirled?

-Yes.
-Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?

-Rainbow.
-Two cherries?

-One on top, one on the bottom.
-Stems removed?

Um.... Top one, yes.
I didn't check the one on the bottom.

LEONARD:
Oh!

I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.

It's all right, Alex. l'm not mad at you.
I'm just disappointed.

Wait, Alex, do you wanna join us?

-Um--
-Alex, a moment.

I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.

Do you think it's appropriate
for her to sit with us, given her station?

Given her what?

If I've learned anything
from British television shows on PBS...

...it's that servants dine downstairs
with their own kind.

What?

It's a kindness, Leonard.

Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them...

...with a glimpse of a world that's just
beyond their soot-stained fingertips.

Oh, sure.

-Please join us.
-Oh, okay. Thank you.

So, Alex,
what's the topic of your dissertation?

I'm looking for Trojan asteroids
at Earth's L-5 Lagrange point.

Oh. That happens to be Dr. Koothrappali's
field of expertise.

You two have a lot to talk about.

Is that true?

-Is he all right?
-No.

But compared to your boss,
he's the poster boy for sanity.

It's okay,
I've been around scientists all my life.

-My dad's an astronomer at SETI.
-Oh, SETl.

The Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

You should introduce him to Sheldon.
The search is over.

What kind of research are you doing?

-High-energy lasers.
-Ooh, military?

Not yet, but l can remove unwanted hair
from 2 miles away.

[ALEX & LEONARD LAUGH]

You were right.
I had nothing to worry about.

That skank's your problem, not mine.

-You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
LEONARD: Oh, thank you.

Agh! Cherry stem. Cherry stem.

[SHELDON COUGHlNG]

How you doing, Howie?
You feeling a little better?

<i>Oh. A lot better, thanks. One sec.</i>

<i>Listen close, l don't have a lot of time.</i>

<i>I need you to go to my house.</i>

<i>In my bedroom you'll find a model rocket.</i>
<i>I want you to bring it back to your place.</i>

Okay.

<i>Step two, build a version</i>
<i>roughly 1 4 stories high.</i>

<i>Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.</i>

[WHlSPERS]
<i>I'll leave the door unlocked.</i>

Maybe you should talk to someone.

Let them know
you're having a little anxiety.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
<i>No, no. l'm fine. No anxiety.</i>

<i>We should probably talk in code.</i>

<i>From now on, "frog" is me, "sandwich"</i>
<i>means you, and "lemon" means rocket.</i>

<i>So come on, sandwich, build me a lemon</i>
<i>because froggie wants to come home.</i>

Look at you...

...putting on a brave face.

There's nothing to be brave about.
Everything's fine.

Really? l don't know how much
you know about primate behavior...

...but Sheldon's assistant
was clearly courting Leonard.

Were she a mandrill,
she would've bent over...

...and displayed her brightly colored
hindquarters like a big red welcome mat.

By the way, you try that
at the junior prom, you get kicked out.

Okay, maybe she was flirting with him,
but who cares?

I don't even know where
my relationship is with Leonard now.

So says your prefrontal cortex.

But the limbic system of your brain
is calculating...

...that if another woman is attracted
to Leonard...

...it must be because he's desirable.

Well, of course he's desirable.
I mean, he's great.

He's smart, he's sweet,
and in the bedroom, whew...

...let me tell you, he really tries.

So it does bother you.

Fine, it bothers me a little.

No, you know what? This is stupid.
It doesn't bother me.

Okay, it bothers me.

But only because she wouldn't stop laughing.
Leonard is not that funny.

And there you have it...

...prefrontal-cortex reasoning
versus limbic lust.

If this were a boxing match
they might call it...

...the Thriller Adjacent to the Amygdala.

[LAUGHlNG]

If you were a brain scientist,
you would be busting a gut right now.

-So how was work today?
-Oh, it was all right, I guess.

Had to Heimlich a cherry stem
out of Sheldon.

-Caught Raj right in the eye.
-Oh.

-You're kidding.
-No, Raj had to go to the nurse.

Wow. Anything else?

Mm, the nurse is a woman,
so he couldn't talk to her.

She had to bring him the Grover puppet
so he could point at what hurt. Heh.

Is that it?

Isn't that enough?

It had weaponized fruit and a puppet.
What more do you want?

Oh, good. Leonard, you're here.

Science news. This will interest you.

And, Penny,
feel free to paint your nails.

-What do you got?
-I believe Alex may have unearthed...

...the grade-school science project that
could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize.

Behold.

"Magnets: What Do They Stick To?"

If the answer is metal,
it's not exactly groundbreaking.

The original title was:

"A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations
Regarding Electromagnetism."

I dumbed it down because some
of the more religious people in town...

...were starting to say l was a witch.

Sheldon thinks the approach
in his paper might change the way...

-...we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
-Oh. It's about time. I hated the old way.

-Hi, I'm Penny.
-Alex.

-Do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
-In a way.

We've kind of been involved
in a five-year experiment.

Oh. Well, you're lucky.
He seems very talented.

I'm sure a lot of people
wanna work with him.

Oh, well, a lot of people can't, so....

Uh, come on.

Where are we going?

My limbic system
wants to take your pants off.

She seems nice.

Notice people on your own time.
We're working.

Hey, Howie, how you feeling?

HOWARD [OVER COMPUTER]:
<i>Better. Much better.</i>

<i>The other astronauts held me down</i>
<i>and gave me a shot.</i>

<i>Ooh.</i>

<i>Attention, people of Earth.</i>

<i>Tonight there will be two moons</i>
<i>in the sky.</i>

Howie, stop that.

NASA's watching this.

Put your pants back on.

<i>Whee!</i>

<i>Whee!</i>

[English - US - SDH]

Howard's capsule should be
reentering the atmosphere any minute.

-It'll be good to have him back.
-The Fantastic Four, reunited, ha, ha.

You had a good run, fake Wolowitz.

We'll remember you
with nostalgic fondness...

...the way we do the dial-up modem...

...the VHS tape,
or Leonard's gym membership.

We're not kicking him out.

-Stuart and l have become good friends.
-Okay, one vote for, one vote against.

-Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.
-I don't have a problem with Stuart.

He gives us a 20 percent discount
at his comic book store.

Well, I don't sell
my friendship that cheaply.

-I can go 30.
-Welcome aboard, old chum.

Okay, the NASA website says
Howard's final descent has begun.

He left a boy.

He returns a boy-sized hero.

[HOWARD SCREAMlNG]

Loops, calm down!

[SPEAKlNG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

-What's that?
-The Jewish prayer for eating bread!

We don't have one
for falling out of space!

We did it.

We're on the ground.
We survived!

That was just the parachute.

We still have another six miles to go.

[SCREAMlNG]

WOMAN [OVER PA]:
<i>United Airlines K9....</i>

Waiting for my husband.

That's nice.

He's coming back from outer space.

I think this flight is coming from Houston.

No, I mean--
Never mind.

There he is!
Howie! Howie!

REPORTERS:
Howie! Howie! Howie!

-Howie! Howie! Howie!
-Thank you. Great to be back on Earth.

Uh, I think they're here for me, Ringo.

REPORTERS:
Howie! Howie!

-Mr. Mandel, l'm your driver.
-Oh, thanks.

That nut job was telling everybody
on the plane he's an astronaut.

I missed you so much.

I missed you too.

Where are the guys?

Oh, it's just me.

Oh, I get it. They're waiting, back home,
with a big surprise party.

Don't worry.
I can act surprised.

[GASPS]

No, I told them
they could have you tomorrow night.

Tonight, you belong to me.

[SNEEZES]

-Gesundheit. You okay?
-I am now that you're back.

Come on, let's go home,
so I can tear off those little pants.

Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose
a lot of muscle tone in space...

...so you might have to do
most of the heavy lifting.

Now, l am very disappointed
that I won't be able to celebrate...

-...Howard's accomplishment tonight.
-Me too, but we'll see him tomorrow.

Yes, it's just that
in all the years l've known him...

...he's never had the opportunity
to receive my admiration.

I was excited to see the look
on his face when it finally happened.

You're unbelievable.

I know.

All right, Pictionary.
What are the teams?

-How about boys versus girls?
-Oh.

That hardly seems fair.

But l guess any team that l'm not on
has a decided disadvantage.

-Once again, unbelievable.
-Yeah. Once again, I know.

All right, round one. Here.

-Got it.
-Okay.

Ready, set, go!

A box?

Uh.... Window?

Batman.

Batman and Robin.

Uh, Wonder Twins, plus the monkey.

Wonder Twins,
plus the monkey and Batman.

-Gift? Present!
-Present! Yeah!

Leonard.
Now, how can you not get that?

In what universe is that a present?

It's not a present.
It's the present.

Look, there's you and me.
It's Penny and Amy.

We're playing Pictionary, in the present.

Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.

-It's a quark-gluon plasma.
-No.

It's asymptotically free partons
inside a quark-gluon plasma.

Nothing with quarks.

It's an observational rebuttal
of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.

-No.
-It's a chocolate chip cookie!

Yes!

-How could you miss that?
-Hey!

If you want someone to guess
chocolate chip cookie...

...you draw a glass of milk next to it.

-Penny got it.
-Yeah, only after l eliminated...

...all the obvious answers.

You're welcome.

LEONARD:
Oh, uh....

Sausage.

Uh.... Bratwurst?

Oh, hot dog.

-Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?
-Relax, we've got time. This is so fun.

There.

A solar system.

Uh, uh, uh....

Unidentified flying liverwurst?

Now?

Soon.

Come on, Leonard.
I am spoon-feeding this to you.

I don't know.

Casper, the alcoholic ghost?

All right, that's enough. Ahem.

AMY:
Uh, hand?

-Nail? Polish?
-Yeah!

SHELDON:
No, no, no!

No!

The word is Polish.
See? Look.

Polish sausage!

Model of the solar system,
developed by Nicolaus Copernicus...

...a Polish astronomer. Finally, if that
wasn't enough, which it should've been...

...this is Madame Curie killing herself
by discovering radium.

Who, although she was a naturalized
French citizen, was Polish by birth!

Excuse me, the word is polish.

See? Small P.

Ah.

So it is.
I guess we both share blame on this one.

Bernie, you okay?

BERNADETTE:
Yeah, l'll be right there.

[BERNADETTE HACKlNG UP PHLEGM]

Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?

[lN NASAL VOICE]
It's allergies.

Okay, ha.

I took some Benadryl, l'll be fine.

So did you miss me?

Are you kidding?
Every minute of every--

[HACKlNG UP PHLEGM]

Oh. Ew.

Excuse me.

Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.

Yes, we do.

-You left right after we got married.
-Ha, ha.

This is like our honeymoon.

-Now, hold on to your hat.
-Oh.

Uh-oh.

-You okay?
-A little dizzy.

Must be the Benadryl.

Switch places with me.

Okay, ha.

Now...

...kiss me.

[SNORING]

Bernadette?

Bernie?

-Bernie?
-Aah!

That was amazing.

You made me feel things I nev--

Well, that was quick and a little gross.

Now l know how she feels.

Hey, Sheldon,
you're always full of fun little facts.

Where did the expression
"got your ass handed to you" come from?

Don't know.

I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome...

...where they'd actually chop
somebody's ass off and then go, "Here."

You know, to appease Loseroneous,
the god of losers.

I am not a loser.

Pictionary is not a true test
of any real intelligence or skill.

In all fairness,
Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills.

A pretty well-rounded game.

Lot of big talk from a man
who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.

Fine, pick another game.
Amy and l will beat you at anything.

All right. Let's play...

...Physics Fiesta.

-Oh, come on. What is that?
-It's a game that I just invented...

...in which the participants answer
physics questions in remedial Spanish.

Uh....

<i>Donde esta el boson de Higgs?</i>

<i>En el acelerador de particulas.</i>

<i>Bueno, mi amigo.</i>

No, no. We're not playing
some dumb, made-up game.

All games are made up.

They're not found in nature.
You don't just dig in the ground...

...come across a rich vein
of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

-Pick another game.
-Why don't we do something athletic?

Like, go over to the university pool
and play water polo?

No good, Sheldon doesn't float.

That is true.
I have a higher than normal body density.

If I run too deep a bath, I drown.

-All right, let's keep it simple. Darts?
-No, that's not fair, either.

-Why not?
-Darts is a bar game.

You've been frequenting drinking
establishments since you were of legal age.

Yeah, that's when it started.

Well, regardless, she has a distinct
advantage in all tavern-based competitions.

Pool, beer-pong, wet T-shirt contests.
They're all out.

Okay, just for the record,
I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest.

I've won a few, but that's just
because l spill when l'm drunk.

We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA
and play real-life Operation.

-No.
-Uh-uh.

I don't think so.

You sure?
The nose doesn't light up...

...but if the corpse is fresh enough
sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.

Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle,
your little star is home!

Ma, the chain's on the door!

MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Howard? I thought
I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow!

Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well,
so I thought l'd stop by.

Tell you about
the greatest adventure of my life.

See if you can make me feel bad about it.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Okay! Hold on, l'm not decent!

All right.

The woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years.
Suddenly she's not decent?

MAN: You want me to hide in the closet
or go out the back?

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Shh! You need to whisper.

Ma, who's in there?

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Uh, nobody! The TV is on!

MAN: l only got one sock.
Where's my other sock?

-Who is that?
MRS. WOLOWlTZ: l told you, it's the TV!

Jay Leno lost a sock. lt's hilarious.

If you're busy, l can come back.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Just give me a second!

Go, go, go!

[WlNDOW OPENlNG]

-Dr. Schneider?
-Oh.

Hello, Howard.

What are you doing here?

Um.... House call.

You're a dentist.

Yes. Yes, l am.

I think he's onto us!

Okay. Glasses off.

Find Waldo.

Hurry up, find him. Find him.

-I'm trying! Don't yell at me!
SHELDON: For goodness' sake.

He's wearing a hat,
glasses and a red-striped shirt!

-I know what he looks like!
-There he is, l got him!

Yes! We win again. Yes.

How could you not find him?

Because he's hard to find!

If he was easy to find,
the books would be called There's Waldo!

Fifty-seven, 58, 59.

That's one minute.

Long division, long division. Go, go, go.

Remember, show your work.

I'm okay. I'm okay.

I'm not okay.

Get up. We can't--
We can't lose in math!

-Thirty-seven!
-Yes!

Ready, set, wrestle.

One, two, three, pin.

Mwah.

-Stop that.
-Mwah.

-Amy, do something.
-Mwah.

Amy. Help.

Wha--? Amy, stop that.

Amy, Penny.
Both of you, stop it.

One to beam aboard?

Oh, my God, you're back.

Oh, look at you.
You-- You look like you grew.

Yeah.

The lack of gravity did decompress my
spine, so I'm, like, an inch-and-a-half taller.

I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get
my license changed before l shrink back.

Come in, come in. I didn't think l was
gonna get to see you until tomorrow.

Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little
under the weather and my mom's...

...kind of under my dentist.

Wait, your--
Your mother's sleeping with your dentist?

Former dentist. I need a new one
now that l know where his hands have been.

So you're wandering
all around by yourself?

That's not the hero's welcome
an astronaut should come home to.

It's okay. You know, we space cowboys
don't do what we do for glory and fame.

We leave that to your rock stars,
and your athletes...

...and your Howie Mandels.

Oh, hey, man, welcome back.

Oh, Stuart, thanks.
What are you doing here?

-I kind of live here now.
-Just until he gets back on his feet.

Which are looking pretty good
in the boots l bought him for his birthday.

[MlMlCS EXPLOSlON]

Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.

Wow, ha, so you guys are, like, buds now?

Oh, yeah. We hang out all the time.

He doesn't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a girlfriend.

It's like we both had these holes in our lives,
but now we fill each other's holes.

That sounds a little funny
to an American ear.

-Which part?
-Just all of it.

Okay, so, what--?
What do you guys got going on, tonight?

Raj is taking me
to the Sound ofMusic sing-along.

Sound ofMusic sing-along?
That used to be our thing, but that's cool.

Howard, it's still our thing. Come with us.
We'll get you a scalped ticket.

So I'd be sitting by myself?

We'll switch.
You'll come sit with me after intermission.

So I'd be sitting by myself
during "Edelweiss"?

No, no, you guys go.

Have fun.

-Okay. Will l get to see you tomorrow?
-Absolutely. See you, Stuart.

Yeah, yeah.

Is he taller?

At least my mother made her boyfriend
climb out the window.

All right, standard state fair
pie-eating contest rules are...

...no hands,
first one to clean the pan wins.

On the count of three.

One...

-...two--
-Wait.

I'm a little concerned.

Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.

-So?
-So with all those antioxidants...

...what if l run out of oxidants?

Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night.

You either stick your face in that pie,
or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.

That's rude.

One, two, three, eat.

Hey, guys,
guess who's back from space.

ALL:
Not now!

Oh, ow! Blueberry in my nose!
Blueberry in my nose!

Snort it down and keep eating!

[SNORTS]

You look familiar.

I don't think so.

Yeah.

I just saw you on the news.

You're an astronaut.

Yes. Yes, l am.

Good for you. How about a piece
of cheesecake on the house?

Oh, thank you so much.
I've been having the worst night.

I just got back and my friends don't care,
my wife's sick.

-Went to my mom's--
-You want the cheesecake or not?

Yes, please.

[SlNGlNG]
<i>And l think it's gonna be a long, long time</i>

<i>Till touchdown brings me round again to find</i>

<i>I'm not the man they think I am at home</i>
<i>Oh, no, oh, no</i>

<i>I'm a rocket man</i>

[SNEEZES]

Perfect.

[English - US - SDH]

Hey, Stuart, l got you
a little souvenir from my trip to space.

Wow, Howard, that's very nice of you.

Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

It's my official NASA portrait.

"To Stuart, your comic book store
is out of this world...

...just like the guy in this picture was."

For the record,
he also thinks that Walgreens...

...and the drycleaners
are out of this world.

That's not true. At Walgreens I was "over
the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

I see you're getting ready
for your Halloween party.

Yeah, it's my annual attempt
to meet women.

Ninth time's the charm.

Would you like me to help? I have a certain
je ne sais quoi when it comes to soirees.

Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quoi.

How much for just quoi?

Don't worry about money,
I'll take care of it.

-Really?
-Yeah, you'll love it.

Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.
Ha-ha-ha.

You know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan...

...they put you up in before the launch.
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

Have you noticed Howard can take any topic
and use it to remind you he went to space?

Interesting hypothesis.

Let's apply the scientific method.
Perform an experiment.

Okay. Hey, Howard.

-Thoughts on where we should get dinner?
-Anywhere but the space station.

On a good day,
dinner was a bag full of meatloaf.

But, hey, you don't go there for the food,
you go there for the view.

That's fascinating.

I'm gonna see if l can duplicate it.

Howard, l've always thought the lemon
was an underrated fruit.

Care to weigh in?

Not really.

-Oh, well.
-People say the Soyuz capsule's a lemon....

Yeah, but, hey,
that baby got me to space and back.

Ladies' night at the Cheesecake Factory,
does it get any better than this?

I hope so.

Question: Do you think your husband's
fondness for turtle-necks...

...is an expression of longing
for his missing foreskin?

It's not getting any better.

[PHONE BEEPS]

Oh, it's Leonard.
He wants to go costume shopping later.

-I thought you liked Halloween.
-I do...

...he wants to go party at the comic store.
Lot of the guys there are kind of creepy.

-Like my husband?
-And my boyfriend?

I'm sorry, Amy, you were saying something
about Howard's foreskin?

Nice try, but you have to go to
that party because we're going.

I'm gonna go, it's just not my idea
of a good time.

Leonard does things he doesn't like
to make you happy.

Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?

-Then what's your job?
-Letting him make me happy.

I just think, in relationships,
you get back what you put in.

AMY:
That's not always true.

Last night I gave Sheldon
my best come-hither look...

...and he responded by explaining
how wheat came to be cultivated.

I guess l could probably try a little harder.

You could start
by taking an interest in his work.

-That's kind of a problem.
-Why?

Not really clear on what he does.

He's an experimental physicist.

Yeah, l'm not really clear
on what that means.

He takes hypotheses and designs protocols
to determine their accuracy.

Yeah, you're really just making it worse.

What kind of tea would you like?

I think I'm going to try
green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

Two tea bags in one cup?

You're not at a rave.

So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking...

...since this is our first Halloween
party as boyfriend and girlfriend...

...I thought it might be fun for us
to go in a couples' costume.

I couldn't agree more.

Really? l find that inconsistent
with everything I know about you.

Couples' costumes are one of
the few benefits of being in a relationship.

Now, imagine this:

You and l, entering Stuart's party...

...and all eyes turn to see America's
most beloved and glamorous couple:

-Yeah?
-R2-D2 and C-3PO.

Dibs on '3PO.

Sheldon, when I said couples' costume,
I meant, like, Romeo and Juliet...

...or Cinderella and Prince Charming.

Not two robots
from some silly movie l don't even like.

Okay.

I'm gonna let that slide because
I know you're hopped up on tea bags.

I make compromises for you all the time.

Just this once, can't we find something
that we're both happy with?

Fine. How about one of the most beguiling
and influential couples of the 20th century?

Hewlett and Packard.

Dibs on Hewlett.

You wanna be Hewlett?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

-Anybody home?
-Hey, what are you doing here?

I just thought l'd stop by and say hello.

What a nice surprise.

-I don't think you've seen my lab before.
-I know, it's long overdue. What you doing?

Better not be building a robot girlfriend.

No. Although, Howard was making some
strides in that area until he met Bernadette.

-What, you're kidding?
-No.

Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box,
waiting for the phone to ring.

-What's going on in here?
-No, no, no, don't look in there.

-Is it a secret?
-No, it's a nitrogen laser.

It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.

Oh, might wanna put a sign on it.

There's a sign right there.

Ah, "Danger." Sure, sure.

So, what's that?

That is an integrated ion trap
and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

Wow. High techie-techie.

What's this little box?

That is a pencil sharpener.

Oh, low techie-techie.

So, what are you working on now?

-It's actually pretty neat.
-Yeah?

It's a front-projected holographic display...

...combined with laser based
finger tracking. Here, I'll show you.

Put this pencil over here.

Sharp, thanks to the machine
we saw earlier.

Very good.

Then a laser will map
the reflective surface...

...and, voila.

Wow, that is amazing!

You know, there's a foundational idea
in string theory that...

-...the whole universe may be a hologram.
-What do you mean?

Oh!

-Wow!
-Mm-hm.

The holographic principle suggests...

...that what we all experience every day
in three dimensions...

...may really just be information...

...on a surface located
at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.

So it's possible that our lives
are really just...

...acting out a painting
on the largest canvas in the universe.

PENNY:
Hmm.

What?

Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
Heh.

You should visit more often.

-What are you doing?
-Take off your clothes.

-What, here, now?
-You got a problem?

No, no. Just kind of crazy.
I've never fooled around in the lab before.

-Really? Never?
-Nope.

I did have a shot with the Lisatronic,
but the extension cord wasn't long enough.

Before l forget, I'd like your opinion on the
menus I've prepared for the party.

The theme is "food that goes
bump in the night."

"Creature from
the Black Forest Ham Lagoon"?

On "sesame seed Bunzillas."

"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?

It's funny because bread sounds like dead.

I'm sorry,
but these are just ordinary foods...

...with the names bent into tortured puns.

But the dishes themselves
are in no way Halloweeny.

Ooh, Hallow-weenies.

That's a good one. They'll pair nicely
with my Draculoni and Cheese.

How do l do it?

Reminds me. l was thinking of wearing
my NASA jumpsuit as a costume...

...but l realized everybody would be like:

"Where's your costume?
Why are you wearing work clothes?"

Hello, boys.

What are you smiling at?

Nothing.

-You know where there's a lot of nothing?
ALL: Space.

Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed
with gravity again.

Did l tell you about the night my retainer
floated out of my mouth into the airlock?

Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

So here we are.

Just a couple of young newlyweds.
What to do?

What to do to you?

Astronaut Wolowitz reporting for booty.

Preparing thrusters.

We have liftoff.

-Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
-Okay, we need to talk.

-What?
-Howie, I know you went to space...

...and I'm incredibly proud of you.

But you might wanna try and
not bring it up every minute.

I don't talk about it every minute.

Tonight at dinner you went on about it
for an hour straight.

What was l supposed to talk about?
We were eating at Johnny Rockets.

Just saying people
are getting a little tired of it.

So I did this amazing thing
and I'm never allowed to mention it?

Of course you can. But, maybe a good rule
would be to wait for people to bring it up.

Okay, heh. No problem.
It won't happen again.

-I love you.
-I love you too.

I can't tell you how many times...

...I dreamed l was in bed here...

...with you when l was....

You know--

[CLlCKS TONGUE]

What, I can't even point?

So, basically,
this is what's called mag-lev technology.

It uses powerful electromagnets to create
a force strong enough to overcome gravity.

-You hold this.
-Whoa, that's heavy.

-Oh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?
-No, why?

Grad student forgot to take out
one of his piercings.

Now he's on a transplant list
waiting for a nipple his size.

Now, watch this.

[MACHlNE HUMMlNG]

[GASPS]

Whoa.

That is very cool.

Sometimes I like to turn this on
and pretend l'm the super-villain Magneto.

Getting a little less cool, Leonard.

What l really am is a very smart scientist.

Who understands
the mechanics of the universe.

And is wearing the sexy black
underwear you bought.

-There we go.
-Yeah.

So I thought the photo booth for the party
could be creepy, like a mummy's tomb...

...or they also have
the TARDIS from Doctor Who.

A TARDIS makes no sense.

A time machine from a science-fiction show
has nothing to do with Halloween.

That being said, if you don't get a TARDIS,
you stink and your party stinks.

-Do you have a preference?
-I don't care, get the TARDlS.

Yes! This party just became a major rager.

By the way, can I borrow
your bullwhip and fedora?

Yeah, sure, whatever.

I was thinking of dressing up as
Indiana Jones's mocha-skinned love child.

Indian Jones.

-Clever.
-What's wrong with you?

Nothing.

Howard, l've got a party to plan,
don't make me pull it out of you.

Here it is. Bernadette said you guys are
sick of me talking about my trip to space.

Is that true?

-No.
-Yes.

We seem to have different approaches here.

I was going for helpful honesty,
I have no idea what you're doing.

It's called being nice.

Okay, if you think being nice
will get him to shut up, l'll try it.

You know what, guys, never mind.

I just won't talk about the greatest
achievement of my life ever again.

Look at that, the problem solved itself.

Hello, boys.

What if we were to go
as dinner table favorites, salt and pepper?

You know salt makes me retain water...

...and my cousin, William, was ground
to death in a pepper factory accident.

Raggedy Ann and Andy?
I loved them growing up.

I don't think so. Those dolls represent
three things I don't care for:

Clowns, children, and raggedyness.

-I think it's a lost cause.
-No.

There are things that say to the world,
"l have a boyfriend and he's not made up."

Matching costumes, hickies, and sex tapes.

Pick one.

What's a hickey?

-How do l look?
-Fine.

Uh-oh. Is someone a little blue?

Come on, Howie, that's, like,
the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.

What do you say, you ready to go?

To tell you the truth,
I'm not really in the mood.

What are you talking about? lt'll be fun,
your friends will be there.

Some friends. They all think I'm boring.

Maybe you should go without me.

No, if l'm there alone people might think
I'm just a really short person from Avatar.

I'm sorry, l just don't wanna go.

Hey, I just spent the last three hours
coloring myself blue.

I'm gonna be washing paint
out of my smurf for a month!

Fine.

Two weeks ago l was an astronaut.

Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf.
Keep walking.

Oh, my God, you guys look adorable!

Thanks, so do you.

-Slutty cop?
-No, sexy cop.

Slutty cop only came
with a skirt and two badges.

And Albert Einstein?

Ja. Und later she's going to arrest me
for going faster than the speed of light.

-I thought we said in the car, no accents.
-Sorry, officer.

Hello!

-It's a great party.
-Thank you.

The monster foods, they're really fun.

Oh, yes, thank you.
I like to think of fun things like that...

...because l'm fun,
I'm not clinically depressed at all.

Sheldon, get in here.

SHELDON:
I should have picked hickey.

STUART:
Hey, look at you guys!

I'm Raggedy Anne and he's Raggedy C-3PO.

SHELDON:
It was a compromise. I lost.

Can you believe Stuart's walking around
taking credit for this party?

-Who cares?
-What do you mean, who cares?

Look what l pulled off here.
The DJ's on fire...

...there's a TARDlS photo booth
in the back...

...oh, my God, the food.
Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and Cheese.

You're right, the party's fantastic!
Tell me more.

I haven't heard enough about it,
because hearing about that never gets old!

-Is this about the space thing again?
-I'm not allowed to talk about it...

...but since you brought it up,
I went to space. Space, space, space!

Oh, Drinky Smurf!

-Can l talk to you for a second?
-Great, now l'm in trouble.

You happy?

You, out!

You are being very rude.

No l'm not. They're all being rude,
and you're being rude.

Me? What did I do?

[AS BERNADETTE] "Oh, Howie,
stop talking about space so much."

"Nobody likes it."

I don't sound like that.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
You're supposed to be on my side.

I'm always on your side.

Then why are you trying to
take this away from me?

Being an astronaut is the coolest thing
I'm ever going to do...

...and if l stop talking about it
then l'm just....

Just what?

Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.

Plain old Howard Wolowitz
is the best guy I know.

-You're just saying that.
-No, I'm not.

I married him. On purpose.

Come here.

-I love you.
-I love you too.

Nothing to see here,
just sexy police business.

Just explaining the theory of relativity.

[WHlSPERS]
<i>Twice.</i>

Hey, what you watching?

I don't know.
Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.

<i>Here you go, it's a Milky Way.</i>

<i>The Milky Way is a galaxy in space.</i>

<i>I've been in space.</i>

<i>Here's a Mars bar.</i>

<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

<i>And this one's a MoonPie.</i>

<i>I walked on the Moon.</i>

<i>What have you done?</i>

Okay, I get it.

[English - US - SDH]

["YMCA" REMlX PLAYlNG ON TV]

<i>It's great to be in the Empire today</i>

<i>It's great to be in the Empire today</i>

<i>We got everything</i>

Try to keep up, Howard. I'm killing it.

Yeah, l wish we looked as cool
dancing in clubs as we do right now.

Don't worry, this is exactly how you look
when you're dancing in clubs.

You're welcome, ladies.

Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen.

[MUSIC STOPS]

Dude, I was about
to Bollywood this bitch.

Earlier today, l invited
Professor Stephen Hawking to join me...

...in the popular online game
"Words With Friends."

Moments ago, he accepted my request.
Do you understand what that means?

That somewhere, right now,
Stephen Hawking is saying:

[lN ROBOTlC VOlCE]
"Damn it. I meant to click 'no'."

I'll walk you through it.

The game is not called
"Words With Strangers."

No. It is not even called
"Words With Acquaintances."

It is called "Words With...."

I'm not finishing your sentence.
You pulled the plug on my funk.

"Friends." lt's "Words With Friends."
Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are.

Now all l need is a bunk bed with a slide.

I'll have everything I've ever wanted
since l was 6 years old.

That's really nice. I'm happy for you.

And I'm happy for you too.

You are now friends with someone who
is officially friends with Stephen Hawking.

Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.

Yeah, and if they ever come out
with a game called...

..."Words With People You Once
Worked With," you'll be off to the races.

Sheldon, l don't think
this actually means that--

[CHlME PLAYS ON TABLET]

Hold that thought.
Professor Hawking has made a move.

Boy, oh, boy.

It's only a matter of time
before we're coming up...

...with fun nicknames for each other.

I'll be Coop. Yeah. He'll be Wheels.

If he's okay with that.

All right.

["YMCA" REMlX PLAYlNG ON TV]

Crank up the a.c., boys.
It's gonna get hot in here.

<i>Young man, young man</i>
<i>Get yourself off the ground</i>

So I was taking a shower
this morning and when l got out...

...I started to dry off
with what I thought was a towel...

...but turned out to be
Howard's mom's underwear.

I had to take another shower.

It wasn't enough.

Nothing will ever be enough.

I once looked in Sheldon's
underwear drawer. He yelled at me.

But now l know what it looks like,
and he can never take that away.

-There's a book under here.
-Oh. I'll get that.

BERNADETTE: l got it. l got it.
PENNY: No, no, it's okay.

-Why do you have a history textbook?
-No, it's.... It's not a big deal.

Just taking a class
at the Pasadena Community College.

That's great. l didn't know
you wanted to go back to school.

It's just one history class.

Look, l didn't finish college,
so I thought l would give it a try.

Not to mention your acting career
is going south like Sherman.

Read about it in your book.

Why would you be embarrassed
to tell us?

I'm not. l didn't want anyone to know.
I haven't told Leonard yet.

-Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?
-Because it's me going back to school.

And he's gonna be all,
"You can do it," and, "How can l help?"

And, "I'm so proud of you." Ugh.

I can't believe you could keep
something like that from him.

You guys have got to be
the weirdest couple I know.

Really?

You can't think of anyone weirder?

I can...

[WHlSPERS]
...but she's sitting right there.

Yes. l play the word "quiver"...

...with a triple letter
and a double word score for 72 points.

That'll let the air out of your tires,
Hawking.

Wow, my boyfriend is friends
with Stephen Hawking...

...and my new dandruff shampoo
doesn't smell like tar.

Everything really is coming up Amy.

It is glorious.

One of the greatest intellects
of our time...

...has agreed to engage with me
in a gentlemanly battle of wits.

And I'm spanking him so hard, his grad
students won't be able to sit down.

You know, when one male dominates
another, his testosterone level rises.

-What's your point?
-It's exciting to think...

...you might be getting
a testosterone level.

[CHlME PLAYS ON TABLET]

Ooh! My friend Stephen just played
the word "act" for 1 8 points.

That's right, l call him Stephen now.

Because l checked,
and he was not okay with Wheels.

Oh. You could turn his "act" into "extract"...

...and it would be for double points.

Amy, why would you give me a word?

Now if l play "extract,"
it would be cheating.

-Sorry.
-Although, l could play...

...the completely unrelated
and better word "extract."

Ethical conundrum avoided.

Thanks, brain.

Spaghetti okay?

It's crunchy.

Just the way l like it.

Yeah, l don't think
the water was really boiling.

-It's great, I love it.
-Ha, ha.

Okay, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

I've been thinking about
going back to school for a while now.

So a couple months ago, I started taking
a history class at the community college.

Oh. That's great. Great, great, great.

-Why wait so long to tell me?
-I just....

I don't want you to make
a big deal out of it.

Why do you think that?
I get it, you're taking one class.

It's nice. Maybe if it goes well,
you take another, you enroll full time.

Ooh. Be sure to keep an eye on which
credits transfer to a four-year college.

You're making a big deal.

Sorry. You know, whatever.
Psh. lt's all good.

Anyway, that's it.
I just thought you should know.

Am l allowed to ask
how the class is going?

It's good. We've been talking
about the origins of slavery.

-I turn in my first paper tomorrow.
-I can help with that.

There's lots of perspectives to take.
Economic, sociological, political--

Hey, this is my paper.

And my perspective
is that slavery is bad.

And my professor's black,
so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.

-Can l take a look?
-No, Leonard. This is my thing.

-Okay. I get it.
-Thank you.

It's like when I started doing chin-ups.

I didn't want you to see
until l could do one.

FYl, really close.

Thank you. Now, behave yourself
and eat your dinner.

And if you're lucky,
you get to sleep with a college girl.

Really? l went to four years of college
and five years of grad school.

That never happened once.

I think the next time l have to speak
to a call center in lndia...

...I'm going to try using
an American accent.

Why?

Because when I use my regular voice,
I feel like l'm making fun of them.

That's ridiculous. Not to mention,
your American accent is terrible.

Dude, my accent is brilliant.

[lN AMERlCAN ACCENT] Hey, my snow-white
American friends, let's put some cow meat...

...on the barbecue and eat it
until we're all obese.

This is what you sound like:

[lMlTATING RAJESH]
"l think l'm talking in an American accent...

...but it really sounds like
I'm wearing a set of giant dentures."

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Sheldon, do l really sound like that?

Tell him he sounds like that.

Sheldon, you okay?

It's been three days.

Why hasn't Stephen Hawking
played a word?

The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't
challenging enough for him.

Not challenging?
I was humiliating the man.

I was thinking of writing a book called...

<i>...A Brief History of the Time I Made</i>
<i>Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.</i>

[lN NORMAL VOICE] There's the problem.
You can't beat Hawking like that.

He hates to lose.
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.

I mean, forget the wheelchair,
he should be in a stroller.

Really?

One time when I was working with him...

...he said that Johnny Depp
was in The Matrix.

I told him he was wrong,
but he kept insisting.

So I looked it up online and showed him.

Well, the next day, he had a pizza party,
and everyone got invited but me.

And then he was all:

[lN ROBOTlC VOlCE] "Your invitation
must've gotten lost in the matrix."

Good Lord. What have I done?

[lN AMERlCAN ACCENT]
Good Lord, what have l done?

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Terrible.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.

[lN lNDlAN ACCENT] l can't sit on that elephant.
My ass is on fire from eating all this curry.

Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

Please be good, please be good.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh....

Okay.

She writes like she cooks.

Play. Play.

Play. Play.

-Play.
-What are you doing?

Trying to use a Jedi mind trick
to control Stephen Hawking.

Play. Play.

[GRUNTS]

He must be wearing a tinfoil hat
or something.

I did a bad thing.

-Does it affect me?
-No.

Then suffer in silence.

Play. Play.

Play.

[KNOCKING]

Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking.

Stephen Hawking.

Penny started taking a class.
She wrote a paper.

She didn't want me to read it.
I went behind her back. l read it.

Stephen Hawking hates me.

I don't know what to do.

The paper's terrible.
But if I tell her, she'll know that l read it...

...and she'll get really mad.

I was beating him so bad
he doesn't wanna be friends anymore.

Why does everyone love me
except Stephen Hawking?

Is it possible we're having
two different conversations?

How would l know?
I'm not listening to you.

Hang on.

Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
Chess clock.

We each get five minutes
to talk about our problems.

We'll take turns.
Each turn will consist of a statement...

...and a helpful response from the friend.

Begin.

I humiliated Stephen Hawking
in a game of "Words With Friends."

He stopped playing.
And now we're not friends anymore.

He's probably busy.
You're worried about nothing.

Give it a couple more days.
I'm sure he'll play...

...and you'll see that everything's fine.

My turn. l can't let Penny
hand in a bad paper...

...but how do l tell her it's bad
without letting her know that I read it?

Hmm.

Beats me. Now....

I know Hawking's not busy,
because l can see...

...he's playing other people right now.

Maybe since you're so good,
he's taking his time to meet the challenge.

-I want Penny to enjoy--
-Wolowitz told me he's a big baby.

Yeah, l didn't know that,
and I played "extract" for 82 points.

Oh, it's all Amy's fault.
She told me to play it.

I have got to cut her loose.

Sheldon, l wasn't done talking.

She hands in the paper tomorrow.
I know l could help her.

And she's my girlfriend.
I should be allowed to help her.

-Why aren't l allowed to help her?
-I hear you, brother.

No, you need to give me some advice.

Uh, fine. Women, huh?

Specific to my situation.

Blond women, huh?

-Empathetic.
-Sucks to be you.

I quit!

Leonard, wait, no.
I listened to your dumb thing.

Leonard, come back.
Leonard, come back.

Leonard, come back.

-What?
-Oh, of course.

It only works on the weak-minded.

Good morning, sunshine.

Leonard, it's 8 a.m.

It's like the middle of the night.

I know, but I have to go to work,
and I made you breakfast.

Oh, wow, that's so sweet.

-Hey, what's this?
-Before you open that....

Um, are you familiar with the story
of the shoemaker and the elves?

Elves? Come on, Leonard,
it's too early for Lord ofthe Rings.

No, no.

Listen, once upon a time,
there was this shoemaker.

And when he went to bed at night,
elves would sneak in...

...and they would make
all these amazing shoes for him.

And when the shoemaker
woke up in the morning...

...he would be super happy.

Not mad at the elves at all.

Open it.

Okay. Ahem.

"An examination of the economic,
cultural and political roots of slavery...

...in the Old South, 1 61 9 to 1 865."

What the hell is this?

Don't ask me, a little elf did it. Ha, ha.

So let me get this straight.

You just assumed my paper would be bad,
so you wrote one for me?

-I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.
-What?

Well, I mean, it was good. There were just
a few things that needed a little polishing.

-Well, you changed every word.
-That's not true. Uh--

"Slavery."

Uh, "161 9." Your name at the top.
That's all you.

You are such an ass.

This is why I didn't wanna tell you
I was taking a class.

Please, don't be upset. l just....

I didn't want you ending up
with a bad grade and get discouraged...

...and give up on the idea
of going back to school.

Right, because me being in school
is so important to you.

That way, you wouldn't have to be dating
someone who's only a waitress.

Come on, you know that's not true.

Do l? Listen to me.
I need to do this on my own.

If I fail, l fail. If l pass, l pass.
Do you get it?

-I'm sorry, l was just trying to help.
-Yeah, well, next time, don't.

Oh. And since you like stories so much...

...this is not the shoemaker
and the elves, okay?

This is give a man a fish, he eats it.

Teach a man to fish,
he sells it or something.

Whatever, l don't know. lt's just
a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!

-You ever hear back from Hawking?
-No.

It would appear as if I've lost him.

Stupid brain.

-It'll be okay.
-How can it be okay?

Stephen Hawking's a genius
and he talks like a robot.

That's everything
I've ever wanted in a friend.

Yeah, but if he's a sore loser,
maybe you're better off without him.

You're right.

I guess l just have to make lemonade
out of the two of you.

[CHlME PLAYS ON TABLET]

Ah! He played. He played.

Coop and Rolling Thunder
are together again.

He was okay with that nickname.

-So now all you have to do is let him win.
-Yeah, way ahead of you.

I will play the word "at"
for two measly points...

...throwing the game
and thus securing my friendship...

...with the smartest man in the world.

What are you waiting for? Hit send.

I can't. Losing on purpose
is intellectually dishonest.

-So don't do it.
-Oh, but l wanna be Hawking's friend.

-So do it.
-But if I do, I'll be a phony.

A sellout. A Hollywood poser.

Then don't do it.

I won't. This feels right.

My mother always said,
"To thine own self be true."

Good for you.

She also told me that every animal
in the world got on one boat.

So, what does she know? And send.

Oh. Hey. Haven't heard from you
in a couple days.

-You still mad at me?
-Nope.

I have no reason to "B" mad at you.

Minus.

[CHUCKLES]

<i>-Wow.</i>
-That's right. On my paper.

Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.

I don't know what to say.

Hmm. How about:

[lN DUMB VOlCE]
"Gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought.

You may be the one in school,
but l'm the one who learned a lesson.

I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh."

She sounds exactly like you.

How'd it go with Leonard?

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.

-Good.
-So I know this goes without saying...

...but if either of you tell Leonard
you helped me rewrite this paper...

...I'll beat you both
with a bag of oranges.

-Okay.
-Understood.

Now, ladies.
We got a B-minus on this paper.

I think if we put our heads together,
on the next one, we could get an A.

But we got you a B-minus on purpose
to make it believable.

Believable?

You saying l'm not smart?

AMY: You're smart.
-No, no.

That's better.

I feel like l'm in high school again.

Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework
so she'll like us.

I know.

It's finally working.

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

It's Stephen Hawking.

Answer it. l wanna hear.

Professor Hawking,
how nice of you to call.

HAWKING [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Hello. l really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.</i>

-Oh, me too.
<i>-Or should I say, Dr. Loser?</i>

<i>Ha-ha-ha.</i>

Yes, congratulations.
You won fair and square.

Very impressive, sir.

<i>-Do you like brainteasers?</i>
-Oh, I love brainteasers.

<i>What does Sheldon Cooper</i>
<i>and a black hole have in common?</i>

<i>They both suck.</i>

[LEONARD LAUGHING]

<i>Neener-neener.</i>

[English - US - SDH]

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Welcome to
<i>Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.</i>

Before we get started...

...I'd like to announce the winner of our
"design your own flag" competition...

...but l can't.

The only entry was from GameyGamer75,
I know that was a JPEG of your buttocks.

Now, this week,
we have a very special episode...

...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

And to help me, l'm pleased to introduce
Internet personality...

...former star of
<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation...</i>

...and the only guy I know lucky enough
to be immortalized in one-sixteenth scale.

Set phasers to "fun"...

...for my friend Wil Wheaton.

-Hi, thanks for having me. Happy to be here.
AMY: Cut.

-What's wrong?
-Sorry, you were brilliant as always.

Wil, that was a little wooden.

-Wooden?
-Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

Just this time,
try to say it the way people sound.

And action.

My friend Wil Wheaton.

Hi, thanks for having me.
I'm excited to be here.

-So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
-Well, this is an exciting one.

This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

-Now, what's interesting about this flag--
AMY: Cut.

-What was wrong with that?
<i>-It's called Fun With Flags.</i>

They're not at half-mast. Nobody died.
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

Um, no offense,
but l've been acting since I was a kid.

I can handle a web show
without a lot of direction.

SHELDON:
It's true.

In 1 982 Wil played the voice
of Martin the mouse in The Secret ofNIMH.

You moved me.

You'll have to forgive me.

This is my first time directing.
I just want it to be good.

-So do l.
AMY: Great.

So this time, let's try more real boy,
less Pinocchio.

-And action.
-And cut.

You realize I'm doing this for free, right?

Yes, and so far,
we're still not getting our money's worth.

Let's try it again.

Everybody's having fun.

And action.

So, Wil...

...what do you have for us first?

Well, this is an exciting one.

This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

Cut.

Problem, first-time director?

None that I could see.

I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as l do.

I got goose bumps.

-He was overacting on purpose.
-Really?

Oh, he reminded me
of a young William Shatner.

I'm really happy to do this for you...

...but not if she's gonna be a huge
pain in the ass the whole time.

Are you gonna let him speak to me
like that?

Well...

...you're my girlfriend,
and I don't want you to be upset.

Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend,
and I don't want him to be upset.

Hmm....

This is a sticky wicket.

What do you think?

Can l speak to you for a second?

I'll be right back.

Feel free to play with yourself.

I don't care for your friend,
and he's being rude to me.

You need to ask him to leave.

Amy, l can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

He's a minor celebrity.

Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

Fine, then maybe l should go.

Could you? That would solve everything.

You are the best.
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

Sure you wouldn't rather have dinner
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

Come to think of it, l would.

You, little lady, are on fire.

Every time we eat here, your mom refuses
to let me help with the dishes.

Don't take it personally.

She likes doing them by herself so she can
lick the plates with no one looking.

You ready to go?

Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

I don't understand why you keep your stuff
here when there's room at home.

What are you talking about?

All l have here is a few sweaters,
books, bank stuff...

...computers, mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

Ooh! There's my plaid dickey.

Oh. Got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it? Heh.

Fifty cents sounds right.

-Let's go.
-You know, it's kind of late.

-Why don't we spend the night here?
-Because we don't live here.

-I know.
-Do you?

You said when you got back from space...

...you were gonna move into my apartment,
but half the time we stay here.

That's not true.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Howard, l'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?!

There's some underwear in the hamper!

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out!

Thank you.
I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

Okay, I see what you're getting at.

How about this weekend,
I'll box up all my things...

...and move them to our place?

Thank you.

The lightsabers will look great
in the living room.

Or in the closet. We can decide later.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Howard, help!
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

Just let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Are you kidding?!
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

Hey, look who's out after dark
like a big boy.

I was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

Four hours more and we would have
closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

-I thought you had plans with Amy.
-Yeah, l did.

But then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

She got huffy and left,
and then Wil and l headed out to dinner.

That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

-Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
-Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

-Then Amy got mad and left?
-Walked right out the door.

And you...?

Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

The manager recognized Wil and let us sit
right next to the frozen-yogurt machine.

Right next to it.

I was closer to it than l am to you right now.

-Buddy, l think Amy might be upset.
-Why's that?

Because your friend was rude to her
and then you went to dinner with him.

You're just repeating what I said.

It's like living
with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

Trust me. Call her.

Fine.

It's a shame you didn't go
to dinner with us...

...because the buffet you're about to enjoy
only serves humble pie...

...a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

I was this close.

What?

You'll appreciate this.

Leonard has some ridiculous notion
that you're mad at me.

Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.

<i>I'm mad at you, Sheldon.</i>

Hmm....

Eat one of your Luna Bars.

Very often, when women think
they're angry, they're really just hungry.

<i>I'm not hungry.</i>

<i>Your friend insulted me</i>
<i>and you didn't do anything.</i>

Precisely. l didn't do anything.

Now, does someone feel like checking
her emotional math?

Keep going, buddy. You're doing great.

<i>Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend</i>
<i>and you should have taken my side.</i>

<i>That's it. End of story. Good night.</i>

Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

What a weird day.

Hey, sorry this took so long.
But you used to work here.

-You know how it is.
-Kitchen slammed again?

No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

So anything l can do
to help you move tomorrow?

Now that you mention it,
I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

-What's your excuse this time?
-No excuse.

It's just, you know, l'm Jewish...

...and technically, we're not supposed
to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath...

...so this one's on God.

That might be more convincing if you didn't
have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

My religion's kind of loosey-goosey,
you know.

As long as you got your schmeckel
clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.

Howie, you promised you'd move.

-And I will.
-Yeah, right.

I'm not going to live in my mother's house
for the rest of my life. l'm not a child.

I've seen her burp you.

She did not burp me.

She was patting me on the back
and I happened to burp.

Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

Yeah, but l told you, I'm not good at my job.

-Listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
-I'm starting to think you're right.

All right, I've had enough of this.
I'm a grown man. l have a successful career.

I mean, for the love of God,
I've been to space.

I will move out when l'm ready, and l don't
need anyone badgering me into it.

Wow. Excuse me.

That was just for her benefit. l'll move
tomorrow. l love you. Don't leave me.

Amy?

Amy.

Angry Amy?

What?

I've been thinking about what happened,
and I hope this gift will make things better.

Star Trek DVDs?

Why would l want this?

First of all, you're welcome.

Furthermore, not being familiar
with Wil Wheaton's body of work...

...there was no way for you to know
you were being rude to a national treasure.

Get ready for 1 30 hours of "I told you so."

Fine, l'll just tell you what happens.

Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint."

Fade in.

The new Enterprise heads out
on its maiden voyage...

...to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy--

She's hooked.

Wow, an end of an era.

Boy, if these walls could talk.

They'd say,
"Why does he touch himself so much?"

Yeah.

I can't believe
I'm not gonna live here anymore.

This has always been my bedroom.

Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

Oh, yeah.

"Fifth grade, sixth grade,
seventh grade, eighth grade, ninth grade."

Yeah, l remember when I was 5...

...hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

Had some Peanut M&M's...

...went into my first anaphylactic shock,
had to be rushed to the hospital...

...came home, celebrated with a Snickers,
went into my second anaphylactic shock.

When did you figure out
you're allergic to nuts?

Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

Okay, wanna start loading this stuff
into the truck?

Yeah, l guess.

Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.

I just want one last moment alone
in my old room.

We're not standing outside by the U-Haul
while you fondle yourself.

[SCOFFS]

Fine, let's go.

Hey, what brings you in?

Penny, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

Had a feeling we'd have a talk like this
sooner or later.

Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

Penny, please, I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair
by the time l was 1 9.

And for the record:

[MlMlCS VOMlTlNG]

-So, what are you drinking?
-Well, it's been a rough day.

I usually go chamomile tea,
but l don't think that's gonna cut it.

You could have a Long Island iced tea.

Will that calm my nerves?

It's calmed the pants off me a couple times.

-Sold.
-Oh.

So the heart you got from the wizard
giving you trouble?

The trouble isn't with me, Penny,
it's with your gender.

Someday scientists will discover...

...that second X chromosome contains
nothing but nonsense and twaddle.

Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.

That's a Band-Aid at best.

The core problem is that Amy and Wil
do not like each other...

...which is baffling
because they're both crazy about me.

And I like them, which indicates
they're bright and interesting...

...and/or were on Star Trek.

Honey, you can't make people
like each other.

Not true. Leonard made me like you.

Let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

Cheers, pal.

Ooh!

Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

Get the Mad Hatter on the horn.
I'm having a tea party.

You might wanna pace yourself.

I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what l'm doing.

Far be it for me
to criticize a man with a full pubis.

Look, your problem is not Wil Wheaton.
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

Problem is l'm out of tea.

Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend,
you just let him do it?

Thought you Texas guys stood up
for your womenfolk.

Oh, Penny, please.

Think I've evolved
beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

Sorry.

On the other hand, that low-down polecat
done wronged my woman.

Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

Amy deserves better.

You know,
when we buy the Planters Deluxe Mix...

...she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

Yup, that she is. Here you go.

I'm a callous egomaniac.
She's gonna leave me.

-No, she won't.
-No, she won't. l'm great.

Ah!

Okay, I have now officially moved out
of my mother's house.

You are now the only woman in my life
who l'll see naked in the bathroom.

I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?

Well, I'm fine. It's just her l'm worried about.

-She'll be okay. She's a grown woman.
-I know.

It's just ever since my dad left,
I've felt responsible for her.

That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

She was just so sad all the time.

I was the only person
who could cheer her up.

Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

She's lucky you were there.

You know, she's why l first got into magic.

I would do little shows for her.

Hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,
put on a top hat and cape.

And partway through the act, I would say
I needed a volunteer from the audience...

...to be my beautiful assistant
and invite her up on-stage.

I can still remember the way she'd smile.

For a few minutes,
she'd forget how lonely she was.

Aw, crap. Let's go.

Where are we going?

Grab a box.
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.

No, but l want to live here.

Well, you should've thought of that before
you told me the stupid magic-trick story.

Can't we talk about this?

No husband of mine
is gonna break his mother's heart.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Wait, how many was that?

-Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
-Wouldn't you like to know.

-Have you been drinking?
-Just tea.

It was the best tea I've ever had.

Why are you here?

I'll tell you.

I'm from Texas.

Need l say more?

Yeah, actually,
a little more would be helpful.

You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.

Two. lt was two.

Wil Wheaton.

Now prepare yourself for what may come.

Oh, Sheldon,
do you really think we're gonna fight?

My fists are not up here
because l'm milking a giant invisible cow.

They're up to beat an apology out of you.

Okay, I'm sorry.

Well, that was a long bus ride
for not very much.

Are you okay?

You're asking a lot of questions,
Wil Wheaton.

As a matter of idle curiosity...

...which of your shrubberies do you feel
would benefit from a thorough vomiting?

Never mind, l'll choose.

[VOMlTlNG]

You were so good in Stand by Me.

[VOMlTlNG]

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Welcome to
<i>Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.</i>

Get ready for a very special episode...

...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

And to help us,
I'm pleased to introduce a special guest.

Surprisingly, it only took gas money and
the promise of free food to get him here.

Mr. LeVar Burton.

Hey, Sheldon. lt's a pleasure to be here.

-Well, we've got some interesting flags--
-Cut.

Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.

I don't know what she's talking about,
but l'm obligated to agree with her.

-She's my girlfriend.
-Ah. l hear you, brother.

I still get lunch, right?

[English - US - SDH]

What are you drawing over there?

A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole...

...that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

Oh, you silly doodlebug.

A lot of scientists believe
making contact with other life-forms...

...would probably not end well for us.

It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.

You could block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.

Do you expect me to build this? Heh.

I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?

-Really?
-He probably just goes to the bathroom.

Actually, no. He goes at 8 a.m.
with optional follow-ups...

...at 1 :45 and 7:1 0 on high-fiber Fridays.

It's sad that you know that.

Oh....
That's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.

I'm looking at his public calendar.

Two-forty-five to 3:05, nothing.

Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

Last week, nothing. Last month, nothing.

He never has anything booked
during that time.

Twenty minutes a day
completely unaccounted for.

-We should figure out where he goes.
-Ooh, this is exciting.

Like one of my classic
murder-mystery dinner parties.

Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life.

Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen
with the olive spread.

It was tapenade and you guys suck.

So how was work today?

Well, I spent most of the afternoon
growing isotopically pure crystals...

...for neutrino detection.

That sounds like fun.

-Yeah, it was.
-Oh, good, I guessed right.

[PHONE BEEPS]

-Who you talking to?
-Oh, just this guy l met at school.

Oh, great. We're still dating, right?

Relax, he's just a friend. We're doing
an oral report together. He's really nice.

I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral."

Would you stop?

[PHONE BEEPS]

He moved here from London.
He doesn't know anybody.

Oh, good, an English accent,
the sexiest accent you can have.

No, that's not true.

There's French, there's Italian.

No, you're right, it's the best.

-Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
-It didn't come up.

Maybe you should tell him.

What am I supposed to say?

Say, "Can't talk right now.
Hanging with my boyfriend.

England sucks, you suck,
U.S.A. number one."

Fine. "Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."

-Happy?
-Yes. Thank you.

PENNY:
Mm-hm.

[PHONE BEEPS]

Huh.

-What did he say?
-Nothing.

What?

"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

I hate this guy.

-Don't be like that.
-Oh, come on. Trust me, he's hitting on you.

He's not, we're just friends.
Is this gonna be a problem?

He's supposed to come over
tomorrow to work.

Really? Here?

If it makes you uncomfortable, l'll switch
partners even though the thing's due...

...and everyone already has a partner
and I'll probably end up failing the class.

That'd be great. Thank you.

Two forty-four. Right on schedule.

Hey, Sheldon.

Oh, hello.

Raj and l are heading over to the genetics lab
to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

-Wanna come with us?
-No, thank you.

You sure? They turn off the lights and it's
like a little laser show that poops all over.

I'm quite sure. Good day.

-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

-We told you.
-Yeah, l just told you.

-No, you didn't.
-Your word against mine. See you in court.

-Should we follow him?
-I don't know. I'm torn.

I want to know where he's going but
now l kind of want to play with the bunny.

-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Alex.

-Do you know where your boss just went?
-No.

-Don't you know his schedule?
-All l know is corduroy...

...makes too much noise
and I have to go find quieter pants.

Come on.

Boy, what l wouldn't give
to get her out of those pants.

And into something a little more stylish.

This is where he goes?

-What's in there?
-I think it's an old storage room.

What could he be doing in there every day
for 20 minutes?

Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs...

...because if he were,
he'd have way better abs.

-Can you hear anything?
-Not yet.

What are you doing?

I'm listening.

Can't you face the other way and listen?

I can't do anything right for you, can l?

What the hell is he up to?

He is kind of a weirdo.

Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.

Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

Howard, you can't treat the man differently
just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

If you're wondering why l've been staring...

...I'm trying to get a look at this guy
who's coming over to Penny's.

To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

It's not a big deal.
He's just in her history class.

They're working on a project.
I don't even know why l care.

-You know what, I don't care.
-You think you don't care.

This is silly. l have nothing to worry about.

Oh, I don't know.

Hey, statistically speaking, l'm sure
you have something to worry about.

What do you mean?

Well, if we assume
that your looks are average...

...right off the bat, 50 percent of men on
Earth are more attractive than you.

That's 1 .5 billion handsome lads
standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.

Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.

I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

Not height, vision, athleticism,
or ability to digest dairy products.

I'm talking about important things
like emotional maturity.

You were just spying on your girlfriend
through a peephole.

I liked it better
when you thought l wasn't here.

I'm not saying
you don't have attractive qualities.

Your choice of friends is impeccable.

You're a good sleeper.

And last but not least,
you buy the grapes I like.

You're a real catch compared
to some snoring guy...

...with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

None of this matters.

I trust that Penny cares about me
and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

Unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

What?

While unlikely,
it's still a statistical possibility.

She might be performing sexual acts
with him and not even know it.

-Now you're just being ridiculous.
-Am l?

The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

He could be having the time of his life...

...while she thinks she's a chicken
pecking for corn.

Look at us, sneaking around in the middle
of the night like a couple of cat burglars.

I think we're more like ninjas.

I don't wanna be a ninja.
I wanna be a cat burglar.

-Fine. l'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
-No, we both have to be the same thing.

Okay, we're ninjas.

Thank you.

But next time we'll be cat burglars.

-It's locked.
-Are you sure?

Yes, l'm sure.

Now, you stand guard, I'm--

It's locked.

Just keep an eye out.
I'll have this open in a minute.

When did you learn how to pick locks?

When I was starting to do magic
in junior high...

...I thought l could be an escape artist
like Harry Houdini.

-How did that work out?
-Pretty good.

I managed to escape friends, popularity,
and every party thrown in a 1 2-mile radius.

-There. Ready?
-Hold on, hold on.

What?

Sheldon is a very smart man, and
he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

Yeah, so?

What if it's booby-trapped?

Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

Oh, great, what's your pl--?

Are we good?

Yeah.

Huh.

Forty-three.

What the hell does that mean?

I don't know.

-The solution to an equation?
-Maybe.

It's a prime number.

Encryption systems are built
on prime numbers.

What kind of secret
does Sheldon have to encrypt?

He's always been very cagey about what
he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.

It's paprika.

Really?

Well, okay, one mystery solved.

COLE: Okay, good night.
PENNY: Thanks, Cole. See you at school.

See you.

I'll be right back.

I thought you left a long time ago.

What's up?

Hey.

You, uh, moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

No. I was just visiting a friend.

Oh, cool.

-That cute blond on 4?
-Yeah. You know her?

Oh, well, l see her around.

I like to keep my distance
because her boyfriend's a pretty scary dude.

-Really?
-Yeah.

He's ganged up.

She told me he's a scientist.

That's the name of his gang.

The Scientists.

They are crazy.

-Well, thanks for the tip.
-No problem, brother. Stay frosty.

We're still dating, right?

-Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
-Oh, hey, Alex.

And call me Leonard.
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

And my mother.

And my sister.

And our cat.

Although, l'm pretty sure Dr. Boots
Hofstadter's degree was honorary.

-May I join you, Leonard?
-Sure.

Thanks.

Hey, Alex, let me ask you something.

My girlfriend knows this guy at school.
He's got an English accent--

Ooh, I love English accents.

Yeah, you all do.

Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.

She says he's just being nice
and I should trust her.

It's probably harmless.

You know how it is.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

Right.

Because girls are always like,
"Ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms...

...and gets a lot of ear infections.
I gotta get me some of that."

I don't know.
Bet it happens more than you realize.

Trust me, it doesn't.

You sure?

You're cute, you're funny.

Maybe you're getting hit on
and you don't even know it.

Really?

I'm pretty sure.

[LAUGHlNG]

Okay, I gotta get back to work.
Thanks for listening.

-No problem.
-Hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.

Come on, we're smart guys.

-We can figure this out.
-Forty-three.

What is 43?

Besides my mom's neck size.

It's the atomic number for technetium.

That stuff's radioactive.

Do you think he's building a bomb?

It took him two years to put together
that Lego Death Star. l'm not worried.

Ooh, this could be something.

Forty-three is the number of calories
in half a cup of fat-free yogurt.

Why would you know that?

I'm sorry, we can't all eat whatever we want
and still stay thin.

<i>Wait. In The Hitchhikers Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy...</i>

...isn't 43 the answer to the question of life,
the universe, and everything?

That's 42, dumb-ass.

Hey, hey.

Feelings.

We should stop. l'm exhausted.

Yeah, me too.
We've got more important things to do.

Who cares what stupid 43 means?

-Not me.
-Let's go home.

-Want to get something to eat?
-Sounds good.

-What the balls is 43?
-I have to know.

Hi.

Hey. Shouldn't you be out with your gang...

...spray-painting equations
on the side of buildings?

-Come on, I'm sorry.
-I just can't believe you don't trust me.

No, I do. Of course l do.

Then why did you embarrass me in front of
my friend? Who knew exactly who you were.

-Really?
-Your picture's on my refrigerator.

You know, I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

What is your problem?

Do you use up your thinking at work
and have none left for home?

I don't know.

It's hard sometimes.

Everywhere you go, guys hit on you.

Even if l'm standing right there.

And they're all taller than me.
Why is everyone taller than me?

You know what, this is all in my head.

It's my problem, not yours.

Leonard, why do you always do this?

Listen to me. You are the one l'm with.
You know l love you.

So will you please relax
because you're driving me crazy.

You know, that's the first time you ever said
that you love me.

Yeah.

We're just supposed to pretend
it's not a big deal?

That's exactly what we're gonna do...

...because you're about to make me cry.

And we both know if I start crying
you're gonna start crying.

-You're right, you should go.
-All right.

She loves me.

[PHONE BEEPS]

"Hey, it's Alex.
Nice having coffee with you.

If you want to talk more, l'm always available."
Smiley face, smiley face.

What a friendly girl.

Okay, picture's up.
Looks like the camera's working.

That's good-quality video.

It better be.
It's the spare camera for the Mars Rover.

How did you get your hands on that?

Million-dollar camera. Ten-dollar lock.

Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.

-What the hell is that thing?
-I don't know.

SHELDON:
<i>This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</i>

<i>Experimental log.</i>

<i>Wormhole generator, test 44.</i>

Wormhole-generator test?

[BOTH GASP]

The first 43 parallel universes I've checked
proved to be empty.

I see no reason to suspect universe
number 44 will be any different.

-Oh, my God!
-Holy crap!

[SHELDON SCREAMING ON-SCREEN]

Ow! lt's eating my face!

It's eating his face!

[BOTH SCREAM]

I found your webcam
and replaced the video feed.

You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

-Sheldon, we're really sorry.
-Yeah, really sorry.

Sorry?

You may not realize it, but I have difficulty
navigating certain aspects of daily life.

You know, understanding sarcasm.
Feigning interest in others.

Not talking about trains
as much as l want to.

It's exhausting.

Which is why, for 20 minutes a day,
I like to go down to that room...

...turn my mind off,
and do what I need to do to recharge.

But what are you doing in there?

And what does 43 mean?

You don't need to know,
you don't deserve to know...

...and you will never know.

Yeah, well, l know how to make
your egg salad now.

One, two, three, four...

...five, six, seven, eight-- Drat.

I'm never gonna get to 43 again.

One, two, three, four-- Rats.

[English - US - SDH]

-They are not.
-They are too.

Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed
by all the data.

You're just clinging to it
out of intellectual stubbornness.

No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance
of the subject matter.

Mummies and zombies
are the exact same thing.

Oh, yeah?

Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

That's called a fashion choice.

All right. You brought this on yourself.

-Sheldon, get him.
-If a zombie bites you...

...you turn into a zombie.

However, if a mummy bites you...

...all you turn into
is some schmo with a mummy bite.

So, like a zombie that's been eaten
from the waist down...

...you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

-Good boy. Here's a cookie.
-Oh, thank you.

Hey, fellas, what's going on?

Mummies and zombies again.

Ahh. They're not the same thing.

You get a cookie too.

Thanks.

Guess who picked up his new car
this morning.

Congratulations.
Does it have that new-car smell?

Yep. For as long
as I can keep my mother out of it.

If you wanna check it out later,
it's parked right out front, Space 294.

-I'm sorry, 294?
-Yeah.

That's my parking spot.

Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car. You don't drive.

It doesn't matter. That's my spot.

Maybe they reassigned it
because you never use it.

I'm not using my nipples either.
Maybe they should reassign those.

Sheldon, someday, if you get a car...

...I'm sure they'll give you
another parking space.

I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space.

Well, it's perfect. lt's a corner spot,
cutting the risk of door dings in half.

It's a mere 28 steps
from the building entrance.

The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days...

...and is also home
to a delightful squirrel...

...which is fortuitous
because most squirrels are real jerks.

Fun story.
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.

Don't try to change the subject.

This is about a parking space.
It has nothing to do with cars.

Are you listening to yourself?

I always listen to myself.
It's one of the great joys of my life.

-Now get your car out of my spot.
-Nope.

Very well, you leave me no choice.

[GRUNTING]

[SQUlRREL CHlTTERING]

What are you looking at,
you stupid squirrel?

President Seibert, listen to reason.

Yeah, l understand
I don't use the parking spot.

That's not the point. l--

Yes, l'm aware you told me
not to call you at home.

But you didn't answer the door.

And I know you were there
because l saw you through the mail slot.

Yeah, well, that's some salty language.

May I remind you, you're the president
of a major university...

...not the president
of the Potty Mouth Club.

There it is again.

Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

Oh. Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

Good night, sir.

Unbelievable.

He says Wolowitz deserves my spot...

...because he's a high-profile asset
to the university.

Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go
to the International Space Station.

That was five weeks ago.

How much longer
is he gonna milk that cow?

Sheldon, let it go. lt's not a big deal.

No. No, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.

See, it starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?

It's like my dad always said,
"First they say you can't drink and drive.

Next you can't let your 1 0-year-old
take the wheel...

...while you sleep one off
in the backseat."

All that story does
is make me feel bad for your mother.

Leonard, you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?

Because l can never understand
your side!

Give it back.

I'm sorry,
but could you be more specific?

My lron Man helmet.
Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.

Oh, that.

Well, see, l wanted it
and you weren't using it.

Apparently,
those are the rules we live by now.

Payback, it truly is the B-word, isn't it?

Sheldon, that is a $500
limited-edition collectible...

...and I want it back.

Well, I'd love to help you out,
but unfortunately...

...I'm using it.

Fine. l'm taking your diploma.

SHELDON: Go ahead.
That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.

It smells funny in here.

We're so proud of you, Amy.
Your first bikini wax.

Yeah.

So how you doing?

Oh, a little sensitive, but not bad.

Does it always take that long?

Uh, no, they don't usually have to go out
and get more wax.

I feel like l'm 5 pounds lighter.

Really? Only 5?

Anybody want a drink?

AMY: Sure.
BERNADETTE: Okay.

So did you spend last night hearing
about this silly parking-space fight too?

For hours. Fortunately,
I couldn't understand most of it...

...because Sheldon was wearing
that stupid robot mask.

Howard was so angry, l had
to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream...

...to get him to fall asleep.

I guess this is what we get for being
with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.

At some point,
they're bound to lock horns.

I'm assuming these are some kind
of horns they bought at Comic-Con?

I'm really sorry
they took Sheldon's spot away.

He shouldn't have to suffer
just because Howard's a big deal now.

I know. Sheldon should just let Howard
have his little moment in the sun.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well, I mean,
Howard's never gonna go to space again...

...but Sheldon will always be a genius.

You're right. And I'm sure Sheldon
will get a fancy parking spot again...

...if and when he makes
a worthwhile contribution to science.

-If and when?
-Maybe we should change the subject.

Amy, how are your lady parts?
Still chilly down there?

Hang on. None of Sheldon's theories
have ever been definitively proven.

My husband actually went
to outer space.

That's an impressive accomplishment.

He's now an inspiration
to millions of Americans...

...who know you don't have to be special
or even qualified to go into space.

You know, I remember the first time
I got a bikini wax.

My sister did it with melted Crayolas
and duct tape.

Yeah, it's a bad idea.

Gosh, Amy. l'm sensing a little hostility.

Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,
your sex life is also theoretical?

Damn.

Well, at least when we do make love...

...Sheldon won't be thinking
about his mother.

That is a cleverly veiled reference
to Howard's lifelong obsession...

...to crawl back into her spacious womb.

Anyway, to this day, l still can't see a box
of crayons without crossing my legs. Ha, ha.

I don't have to take this.

I'm gonna go home
and have sex with my husband right now.

Maybe I'll let him do it to me
in the parking spot.

Which sounds dirty
but l didn't mean it that way.

Okay, here's another one.

If a zombie bites a vampire...

...and the vampire bites a human...

...does the human become a vampire
or a zombie?

Or a zompire?

Sheldon?

Cookie?

-I don't have any.
-Well, I'm not giving it away.

HOWARD: Hi, Sheldon.
-Aah!

He's in my spot.

Leonard, make him stop being naked
in my spot.

Howard, what are you doing?

He wasn't using it...

...and I needed a nice cool piece of leather
to wiggle my naked ass on.

Get off there.

Give me back my lron Man helmet.

Give back my parking space.

You don't need a parking space.
You don't have a car.

You don't need an lron Man helmet.
You're not lron Man.

Well, we appear
to have reached an impasse...

...and, you know, l have to say,
I thought you'd be more upset...

...that your laptop is sitting on my junk.

I didn't pick up on that.
That's a nice touch.

This is so exciting. I'm feeling all tingly.

Although, that could just be
my newly defoliated bikini zone.

Keep a lookout.

This place is swarming
with campus security.

They will not hesitate to scold us.

Freaking pigs.

Oh, yeah.

Okay, now pull your car into the spot
and let's get out of here.

Wait, l'm leaving my car here?

Yes. And be sure
and put on the emergency brake.

It really makes these things tough
to budge.

Before l park, come in the backseat.

I wanna show you something
I had done today.

All right. Color me intrigued.

AMY:
What do you think?

SHELDON:
I think you're high on paint fumes.

And, boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.

Okay, Howard's mother is in, like,
every one of your wedding photos.

What can l tell you? She's a big girl.

Wherever you look, there she is.

More coffee?

No, Leonard's taking me
to a physics lecture...

...and coffee will just keep me awake.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Oh, I'll get it.

Oh, looks like someone's
on Team Bernadette.

-Where's Howard?
-He's not here. What's wrong?

He had my car towed.
It cost me $200 to get it back.

Oh, no.

Where was it parked?

In Sheldon's spot.

Well, that doesn't make sense.
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

Was it maybe in Howard's spot?

Don't play dumb with me, sister.
You tell your husband he owes me $200.

-Well, that doesn't make sense either.
-Why not?

Because l'm the one who had it towed.

-You?
-Didn't see that one coming, did you?

Oh, yeah?
Well, you're not gonna see this coming.

PENNY: Aah!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God, are you okay?

[PENNY YELLS]

PENNY: What the hell do you have in there?
-My wallet, keys...

...and a coffee can full of change
I've been meaning to take to the bank.

-Don't move. l'll get some ice.
-Are you okay?

PENNY: Get away from me, or I swear to God,
I will rip out what's left of your pubes.

BERNADETTE: Here.
PENNY: Oh, thanks. Aah.

Amy, you think maybe
this has gotten out of hand?

PENNY:
Gee, you think?

I do. Penny, Bernadette and l are sorry.

-You hit her. What did l do?
-You had my car towed.

-You were parked in Howard's spot.
-I was in Sheldon's spot.

Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

PENNY: Guys, I think l need to go
to the emergency room.

-Okay, let's go.
-I'll drive. You can see...

-...where the tow truck scratched my car.
-The tow truck didn't scratch your car.

-How do you know?
-Because l did it.

Morning, Professor Stevens.

Hey, don't look at that whiteboard.
That's my math, not your math.

Keep walking, nosy.

What the hell are you doing?

Oh. You said l'm not using my space,
so I'm using it.

Okay, you need to move now.

No, I don't.

You can't stay there forever.

Actually, I have a plastic baggy
strapped to my leg that says l can.

Give up, Wolowitz.

You've chosen to tangle
with a superior intellect you can't defeat.

There is nothing
you could possibly do to--

[HORN HONKlNG]

Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon.

Oh, yes, they are. l mean, what?

I'm warning you, Sheldon.

Your threats are empty.

Nothing can move me.

-Stop that!
HOWARD: Get out of my spot!

No. That's it.
I am calling campus security.

You prepare for the scolding of your life.

What are you idiots doing?

He's trying to kill me, Leonard.

Video games and rock music
have desensitized him to violence.

Would you please talk some sense
into your lunatic roommate?

You're both acting like lunatics.
It's just a parking spot.

Not just a parking spot.

He can't handle the fact
that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.

Oh, preposterous.
I have been solely responsible...

...for this university's
six-loop quantum gravity calculations.

I have changed the way we think
about Bose-Einstein condensates...

...and I am also the one
who got Nutter Butters...

...in the cafeteria vending machine.

Maybe you missed that news while you were
floating around like a goof in outer space.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

Can you believe this guy?

What l don't believe
is you tried to run him over.

Oh, like you've never thought
of doing that.

Don't hate me
just because l lived the dream.

[HORN HONKS]

Hey, sweet ride.

What are you doing in there?

Just breaking in your new car.

Stop that! You stop that!

You know what they say.

Revenge is a dish best served nude.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

-Hey, got a minute?
-Oh, of course, come in.

This is an authentic Chinese throwing star,
and I must warn you...

...I have seen many people throw them
in movies.

Calm down. Howard has something
he wants to say to you.

HOWARD:
All right.

Sheldon, when this whole thing
with the parking space started...

...I had no idea
just how much of a crazy bastard--

Howard, that's not how we practiced it.

I had no idea
how much that spot meant to you.

Anyway, I called President Seibert...

...and told him
it's not worth fighting over the spot...

...so you keep it...

...and I'll park in the structure
across the street.

Well, Howard, thank you.

That's quite a gesture on your part.

You've shown yourself
to be the bigger man.

-Thank you.
-Which l find totally unacceptable.

I must be the bigger man.

Therefore, you may use my spot...

...until such time as l learn to drive
or get a Batmobile.

Wow, okay. Well, thanks.

I don't know what to say.

There is nothing to say.
Except l'm the bigger man.

[HOWARD CHUCKLES]

I'm not kidding. Say it.

Just say it.

You're the bigger man, Sheldon.

Oh, stop.

And I believe this is yours.

FYl, if you wear that into a bank,
they will tackle you to the ground.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To burying the hatchet.

To burying the hatchet.

You know,
I'm kind of glad this happened.

Me too. In a weird way,
I kind of feel like it brought us closer.

Yeah, everybody's happy. Great.

CLEANER:
Can l help you?

Yes, according to information l gleaned
from Yelp...

...you had great success
when a SantariaSuzy37...

...brought you a pair of leather slacks
stained with chicken blood.

You know, I believe
I may have a similar problem.

This cushion experienced
a nude revenge wiggle.

A what?

A naked man sat on it.

Now, here's my concern.

His diet is rich in fatty deli meats.

What tests do you have
to detect lipid residue?

Lipid what?

Lipid residue.

An anal autograph.

A colon calling card, if you will.

-Tuesday okay?
-Oh.

Don't rush it. We may be dealing
with befoulment on a molecular level.

Let me write you a ticket.

Is that your son?

Uh-huh.

Looks like that laptop's seen better days.

If you're interested, l'm selling this.

It's only 2 years old...

...has 1 6 gigabytes of RAM...

...Intel Core i7 processor...

...and I can personally guarantee...

...it has spent less than 20 minutes
resting on an astronaut's penis.

[English - US - SDH]

Is anyone else troubled
by the Spider-Man theme song?

Why would it trouble you?
It's your third-favorite cartoon theme song.

It is, right behind,
"Do, do, do, do, do, lnspector Gadget."

And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Heroes in a half shell.

Turtle power.

However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit
that Spider-Man, Spider-Man...

-...does whatever a spider can.
-Yeah, so?

I can think of many things
Spider-Man can't do that a spider can.

One, crawl in your ear and die.

Two, legally leave Guatemala
without a passport.

And three, have sex with a spider.

Can we change the subject?
Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

It's "heebie-jeebies."

I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.

I was thinking we could have
a little film festival tonight.

The theme:
Movies that killed their franchises.

Oh.
<i>Like Jaws 4, lndiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1 .</i>

<i>Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.</i>

I mean, you know a movie's bad
when my homegirl Sandy B can't save it.

Penny's working tonight. l'm in.

Not me. I'm having dinner with Bernadette
and her parents.

-Fun. We know how much you love that.
HOWARD: lt's torture.

Especially with her dad.
We have nothing in common.

You know what l like to do
when l'm forced to speak with those...

...beneath my intellectual station?

I bring up an interesting topic...

...like the difference between
Spider-Man and spiders.

Thanks, Sheldon.
I'll try that with my father-in-law.

No, you can't use that one. That's mine.

Try this one for an icebreaker.

Uh, despite popular lore...

...there is no place in the continental
United States, Alaska or Hawaii...

...from which one can dig straight through
the center of the Earth and come up in China.

Great. Thank you.

Actually, you can't have that one either.
It's too good. Sorry.

What about you, Sheldon?
Do you have plans?

Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me
to a memorial service.

It's for one of her colleagues
who is of Asian descent...

...so my planned conversational gambit
is to casually remark...

...that no matter how deep they dig his grave,
he'll never make his way back to China.

That should lighten the mood.

What can l say, I put the "fun" in funeral.

Amy? Amy?

Oh, right, funeral.

Amy?

Hello, Sheldon.

I'm not allowed to wear
my Silver Surfer tie...

...but you can wear a bathrobe?

I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.

You're sick? You poor kid.

Well, see you.

Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?

Me? No, l'm not that kind of doctor.

But our relationship agreement
clearly states...

...when one of us is sick,
the other must take care of them.

Oh. I see the confusion.

The intent behind that clause
was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill.

When you're feeling better,
you'll think that's funny.

Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

Amy? Amy? Amy?

I made a commitment in writing
to comfort you in times like this.

And, additionally, you are my girlfriend
and I care about your well-being.

-Thank you, Sheldon.
-You're welcome.

Now let's get this over with.

-So how have you been?
-Fine.

Good.

Fine is good.

-How are you liking retirement?
-It's fine.

I'm sensing a theme.

You ever really think about
the Spider-Man theme song?

How's that dinner coming?

-I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.
-I like rare chicken. Let's do this.

You could die.

Death by chicken. Ha, ha.
That's a pretty fowl way to go.

-Here's another beer, honey.
-Thank you.

So, Mrs. Rostenkowski,
you took that trip to the Grand Canyon.

-How was it?
-It was good.

Had no idea you were the chatty one.

[THERMOMETER BEEPS]

One hundred two point two.

[COUGHS]

Exactly what it was half an hour ago.

It's like you're not even trying to get better.

Sheldon, you don't get over the flu
in half an hour.

Well, not with that attitude.

You know, I have to say,
I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.

I'm sorry. l just want you to get better
as soon as possible.

And with that goal in mind,
let me ask you a question.

Do you believe in the placebo effect?

Of course I do. There have been many studies
proving its validity.

Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac...

...but it is really a powerful medication
specifically designed...

...to cure your illness,
as well as freshen your breath.

Sheldon, this isn't helping.

Why don't you just let me get some rest?

How can you sleep?
I'm not done making you feel better.

I still have to put a cold rag on your head,
sing to you...

...and apply VapoRub to your chest.

You wanna rub something on my chest?

Yes. All over it.

Ahem. Maybe we should start with that.

Now you're being a responsible patient.

Now, you may notice some tingling.

Oh, I'm counting on it.

[SHELDON HUMMING]

-Okay, dig in.
-Hold up.

Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

...from thy bounty through Christ our Lord,
amen.

Took the words right out of my mouth.

So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?

-I'm going next weekend.
-Oh. You like to fish?

Yes.

Sure. l can hear it in your voice.

If he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.

You know, I hadn't thought of that.

[WHlSPERS]
Help me.

Dad, maybe you could take Howard
fishing sometime.

-Give you a chance to get to know each other.
-No, no. We know each other well enough.

He's been talking my ear off all night.

Howie, I think you'd have fun.

-Fine. You can tag along.
BERNADETTE: Terrific.

My two favorite fellas "gone fishing."

Hang on a second.
Bernie, next weekend we have that thing.

-What thing?
-You know, the thing.

Oh, that thing. No, I canceled that thing.

All right, it's settled.
You and l are going fishing.

Great. Heh. Thanks for the help.

I've never even been fishing.
This is gonna be a disaster.

If you don't want to look foolish
doing something, you should practice.

Do you know how many beef Wellingtons
I made by myself...

...before I invited you guys over?

I'll give you a hint.
You can see them here, here and here.

Raj is right. You should get someone
to give you some pointers.

Do you guys know how to fish?

-No.
-No.

But if you catch anything,
I know how to steam it in banana leaves.

Come on, we must know somebody
who can do manly stuff like this.

What's up?

Step one, worms.

Ew.

Okay, "ew" is one of the things you're not
gonna wanna say in front of your father-in-law.

It's right up there with
"icky" and "get it away."

-Now pick one up.
-Really?

-You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.
-Okay.

What are you waiting for?

I don't know.
For them to die of natural causes?

Just pick up a worm
and put him on this hook.

Fine. Ahem.

[BREATHING HEAVlLY]

There. Heh.

I'm no expert, but I think the hook
has to go through the worm.

Fine.

Sorry, Mr. Worm.

Sherm. Sherm the worm.

Hey, don't name him,
just jab a hook in his face.

-You got this, buddy.
-Yeah, come on. Hook that worm.

-You can do it.
-That's great.

Cheerleading. Way to man things up.

"--and the control group displayed
significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.

But because of flaws
in the experimental design...

...relating to environment and diet...

...they lived inconclusively ever after."
The end.

That was great. Rub my chest again.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

No. I need to get you down for a nap.

And for some reason,
that VapoRub gets you all fired up.

-How's the poor thing?
-I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.

Hey, Amy, I brought you some drugs
we've been working on in the lab.

This is proving really good for congestion.

There's a chance
it can make tears burn like acid.

So if you take it, happy thoughts.

I'm gonna draw you a soothing bath.

-Where's your bath thermometer?
-I don't have a bath thermometer.

Fine, then l'm going to draw you...

...a nerve-wracking bath
of indeterminate temperature.

This is a really good expectorant.

Although, some test subjects reported lactating
uncontrollably when they heard music.

Okay, okay, here's the deal.
I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.

-I don't understand.
-I got better two days ago.

It's just been so nice
having Sheldon take care of me.

-So you've just been lying to him?
-You see the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.

I don't mean to be judgy,
but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.

All right. I'll tell him.

SHELDON: Amy, would you be strong enough
to bathe yourself or do you need my help?

I'll tell him tomorrow.

Momma needs a bath.

Now, let's assume by some miracle
you actually catch a fish.

You're gonna have to know how to gut it.
So, what you're gonna do...

...is you're gonna take your knife,
slice him right up the belly.

[GAGS]

-Do you want me to stop?
-No, I'm fine. Keep going.

You don't wanna cut too deep into his guts
or the blood will just squirt all over your face.

[ALL GAG]

Oh, my God. What is with you guys?

Well, it's not our fault.
Our dads never did anything like this with us.

-What, never?
-My dad was an anthropologist.

The only father-son time he spent...

...was with a 2000-year-old skeleton
of an Etruscan boy.

I hated that kid.

Mine just took me to his gynecology office.

I got so bored, l'd put vaginal lubricant
at the bottom of my shoes...

...and pretend l was ice skating.

Yeah, well my quality father-son time
was spending my adolescence...

...looking out the window,
waiting for my dad to come back some day.

Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

We didn't have opportunities like this
when we were growing up...

...but right now there's a dad
that wants to take you on a fishing trip.

You're right. Ugh. I should do this.

Great. Ahem. Here you go.

Now what you do is, you stick your thumb
down its throat, grab the guts and pull.

Here we go.

[GROANlNG]

Oh, look, it's a female.
You can see all the eggs.

[ALL GAG]

[KATRlNA AND THE WAVES' "WALKING ON
SUNSHINE" PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS]

[CLlCKS]

Oh, Sheldon, am l glad you're back.

I've taken a turn for the worst.

I think I'm gonna need another bath.

I'm surprised to hear that.

You see, the other day,
I was concerned that you weren't recovering...

...so while you were sleeping,
I took a cheek swab...

...and had it cultured in the lab.

-Oh?
-I got the results back.

Have you developed any
of the following symptoms?

A growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation
in the trouser region?

Also known as full-blown
Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire.

All right, all right.
But l really was sick at the beginning.

It's just been so nice
having you take care of me.

It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

I thought our relationship
was based on trust...

...and a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

I feel terrible I did this.

It pains me to say it,
but l think some form of penalty is in order...

...so as to discourage this type of behavior
in the future.

I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?

In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade
in the public square.

And that probably requires a permit.

I could not be allowed to go to the opening
of the next Star Trek movie.

Oh, that seems overly harsh.

You gave in to a human weakness.
You didn't kill a man.

You know, it's a tad old-school...

...but my father was not one
to spare the rod...

...when my brother would sneak into his truck
and drink his driving whiskey.

Are you saying you wanna spank me?

I don't want to...

...but it looks like you left me no choice.

That's true.

I've been a very bad girl.

Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.

-That's what you're wearing?
-No good?

The guy at the sporting goods store
said these are what fishermen wear.

Maybe in cartoons.

I wish I had known that before
I posted all those pictures on Facebook.

All right. Let's hit the road. I wouldn't mind
shooting some ducks in the morning.

Wait, now we're shooting things?

I like using a big shell.

You can't eat them afterwards
but it's fun watching them blow up.

Sir, l'm flattered that you invited me
and I really want you to like me...

...but l don't think this trip is the way to do it.

And I can't return these things
if there's chunks of duck all over them.

-So why'd you agree to come?
-Because Bernadette made me.

I tried to back out too.
My wife said I had to go.

Really? Your wife makes you do stuff?
You're a big, scary cop.

You're an astronaut
and your wife makes you do things...

...and she's only 4 feet tall.

So, what do we do now?
They expect us to go away for the weekend.

[SlGHS]

There's an lndian casino near Palm Springs.

You know how to shoot craps?

No, but l'm not a stranger to dice games.

I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School
Yahtzee champion.

[SPEAKS lN HEBREW]

I'll teach you how to play.

Really?

Thank you, sir.

Call me Mike.

Okay.

Boy, we're just married to
a couple of ball-busters, huh, Mike?

That's my wife and daughter
you're talking about.

Great couple of gals.

I wouldn't go that far.

Are you prepared to receive
your punishment?

One second. l wanna put on some music.

Why?

I don't wanna disturb the people next door
while you discipline me.

[SOUL MUSIC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS]

Very well, then.
Get over my knee. Let's begin.

Oh, my.

Excuse me. You're not supposed
to be enjoying this.

Then maybe you should spank me harder.

Maybe I will.

[AMY GIGGLES]

[English - US - SDH]

Okay. "Now holding sides of hearth
in position...

...lower mantelpiece assembly
onto top tabs."

Look at that, l built a fireplace
with my own two hands.

You're so butch.

Aw, l got a little paper cut.

Of course you did.
You're hands are softer than veal.

Oh, uh, before l forget, Saturday I'm planning
a Dungeons & Dragons night with the guys.

That's how you're gonna spend
your Saturday night?

-Come on, I hardly get a chance to play.
-You poor thing.

Is having a real girlfriend
who has sex with you...

...getting in the way
of your board games?

A little bit, yeah.

Oh, great, l've always wanted to play
Dungeons & Dragons.

Oh, I'm sorry,
I should've mentioned this earlier.

You're not invited.

Why not?

Amy, from time to time,
we men need to break free...

...from the shackles of civility and get
in touch with our primal, animalistic selves.

By rolling dice and playing make-believe
with little figurines?

Like a bunch of savages.

<i>Saturday night?</i>
<i>But l've been working late all week.</i>

<i>-That was gonna be our night.</i>
-I have to go, we play as a group.

And if l'm not there,
then everyone will blame you.

They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined
everything. She's the worst."

So you see, heh,
I have to play Dungeons & Dragons.

For the marriage.

<i>You're an idiot.</i>

I'm your idiot. Forever.

So listen, l know we talked about
getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake...

...then seeing the Christmas lights
in Griffith Park...

...but Leonard's talking about
a big D and D game at his place.

Saturday night just went
from crazy to epic.

RAJESH:
Woo-hoo!

All right, Sheldon, to start our quest...

...you need to open this Christmas gift
I got you.

A Christmas gift?

You know l don't enjoy Christmas.

-What's wrong with Christmas?
-Oh, where to begin?

Trees indoors.
Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas."

And the absurd custom of one stocking.

Everyone knows socks belong in pairs.

-Who uses one sock?
-A pirate with a peg leg. Heh.

Actually, that helps. Thank you.

Would you just look inside?

Oh, a scroll! I like scrolls.

They're my third-favorite system
of transmitting the written word.

After stone tablets and skywriting.

"You have all been summoned to join
a thrilling Dungeons & Dragons adventure.

Your quest begins in a secret
northern village of elves...

...who have all been massacred."

Ah! l like where this is headed.

"Your task is to rescue their leader
from a dungeon of ogres."

That's a saucy twist.

"That leader's name: Santa Claus."

No, no, no.

It's actually "ho, ho, ho,"
but you'll get the hang of it.

Thought it'd be fun to make
a holiday-themed quest.

Fun? Mixing Dungeons & Dragons
with Christmas...

...is like making a sandwich of grape jelly,
the best-tasting jelly...

...and petroleum jelly,
the worst-tasting jelly.

Okay, here we go.

"You find yourselves in the smoking
remains of Santa's village.

Clearly a great battle has taken place."

Oh, man, the first monster I see,
I'm going to sneak up behind him...

...whip out my wand
and shoot my magic all over his ass.

Do you hear yourself
when you say these things?

Okay, there are ogre tracks and
a trail of broken candy canes in the snow.

Sheldon, what do you do?

I signal my contempt for your cruel plan
to shove Christmas joy down my throat...

...by making a gesture that says,
"Get a load of this guy."

[RASPBERRlES]

Fine, Howard, what do you do?

I follow the ogre tracks,
checking for secret doors along the way.

And you discover a secret door
leading to a dark corridor.

Let's make a plan. Spellcasters in the back,
warriors in the front.

Screw that noise, l'm going in.
Hang on, Santa, l'm coming for you.

Okay. You run into a room full of weapons,
hit a trip wire.

A cannon blows your face off.
You die, you're out of the game.

What? A cannon?

Am l really out of the game?

Lucky.

Okay, come on. Moving on.

Wait, doesn't anyone have
a rod of resurrection?

Because if you've got one, l need it bad.

Get in here with your rod
and give it to me.

Okay, you need to say these things
in your head before you say them out loud.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hey, I don't mean to interrupt
your little game...

...but l thought you'd like to see what
you're missing out on. So, ahem, Bernadette?

[POP MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps
and a racktastic red dress from Forever 21 .

And there's Amy showing
all kinds of ankle...

...in an outfit I'm assuming
is from Forever 63.

And I myself...

...am wearing a little number that got me
out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.

I know they're making a rhetorical point,
I just don't know what it is.

See you, boys. We are going drinking.

Wait. Can l come with you?
My character died.

-Sorry, Raj. lt's girls' night out.
-Maybe another time.

Okay.

Come on.

[RAJESH GASPS]

Girls' night. Girls' night. Ooh! Ooh!

How does he not hear that?

What's the plan?
We gonna teach our fellas a lesson...

...by getting stinking drunk,
luring strange men into the bathroom...

...and turning the toilet stall
into a temple of the senses?

[POP MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

-No.
-No.

Jeez. Who's Forever 63 now?

Can we get another bottle of champagne
for the table? Don't worry, it's my treat.

-Thanks.
-You should come to girls' night more often.

And not just because if you weren't here
this would be a can of Pabst.

Nothing makes me happier
than the chance to spoil a lady.

Just ask my dog. My vet says
if l give her any more foie gras...

...she's going to die of gout.

-Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.
-No, no, no, I'm fine.

Are we talking one-night stand
or do we wanna get him into a relationship?

Let's get him laid.

Stop it, you're ruining girls' night.

Raj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar
full of single women. Let us help you.

You're a real catch.

You're shy, but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't have someone in your life.

That's sweet of you,
but what can you do to help?

We'll nose around, see if we can find
a nice girl and then introduce you.

Okay. A couple of things.

Don't tell them l come from money,
I want them to love me for me.

They must be insanely hot.

Like nines or 1 0s.

Nines or 1 0s?

Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing
to bring another eight to the hot tub.

You'll take any woman
who'll have you, right?

In a New Delhi minute.

I don't remember you buying these
miniatures in my store.

Oh, uh, yeah. l got them on Amazon.

Sure. l get it.

Why support a friend when you can support
a multinational conglomerate...

...that is crushing the life
out of that friend?

I know, but when l shop online
I can do it on the toilet.

Have you seen my store?
The whole place is a toilet.

-Can we please move this along?
LEONARD: Yeah, sorry.

Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel
and find a large chest.

What do you do? And Howard, do not say,
"l feel up the large chest."

Excuse me, l'm a married man now.
I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.

-Great, what do you do?
-I walk up to the large chest...

...bury my face in it and go:

[BLUBBERS]

I open the chest.

It's locked, but suddenly the door
behind you slams shut...

...and now the walls of the room
start closing in.

That's not good. My character and l
both have claustrophobia.

Glowing letters appear on the chest
that read:

"lf squashed to death
you wish not to be...

-...sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."
-Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?

-Walls are getting closer.
-Oh, boy. Happy place, happy place.

Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.

Ten seconds from getting crushed.

-Nine. Eight.
-What are we supposed to do?

-Seven. Six. Five.
SHELDON: Wait, wait.

Svaty Vaclav is better known
as Good King Wenceslaus...

-...from the Christmas carol.
-Never heard of it.

Must be the one Christmas song
not written by a Jewish guy.

-Three. Two.
-Somebody sing the damn song.

[SlNGlNG] Good King Wenceslas looked out
<i>On the feast of Stephen</i>

<i>When the snow lay round about</i>
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

Walls are getting slower.

<i>[SINGING] Brightly shone the moon that night</i>
<i>Though the frost was cruel</i>

<i>When a poor man came in sight</i>
<i>Gath'ring winter fuel</i>

-The walls stop. You're safe.
-That was amazing, Sheldon.

-How'd you know that?
-Simple.

I combined a well-known historical fact
about Bohemia...

...with the memory of my grandparents,
Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop...

...singing carols,
while l sat in front of the fire...

...and tried to build a high-energy particle
accelerator out of Legos.

-Okay, continuing our quest--
-Wait, there's still four more verses.

You don't sing a song and not finish it.

<i>[SINGING] Hither, page, and stand by me</i>
<i>If thou know'st it, telling</i>

<i>Yonder peasant, who is he?</i>
<i>Where and what his dwelling?</i>

<i>Brightly shone the moon that night</i>
<i>Though the frost was....</i>

[POP MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

-It looks like he's doing pretty good.
-Of course he is.

That girl just got dumped by her boyfriend,
she's angry, she's drunk...

...and her favorite movie
<i>is Slumdog Millionaire.</i>

That is some low-hanging fruit.

Oh, here he comes.

-So, how'd it go?
-Great.

I bought her a couple of drinks
and she gave me her e-mail address.

BOTH:
Ooh!

"Jennifer at not even if you were
the last guy on Earth dot loser."

What?

I'm sorry, Raj.

Why can't l find someone?

I'm smart, l've got a cool job
and my naturally bronzed complexion...

...means I can pull off mustard yellow
in a way most guys can't.

-Aw, honey, it's not you, it's them.
-No, it's not. She was too beautiful for me.

-Why would you say that?
-It's true.

I'm always attracted to women l can't have.
I do it all the time.

I did the same thing with the two of you.

The two of them? l don't understand.

Well, uh, there was a time
when l had a thing for Penny.

I thought she was into me too.
She got drunk and naked...

...and climbed into bed with me.
But apparently, l misread those signals.

And you liked Bernadette also?

That was before Penny.

I make it a rule to only fall for
one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.

I'm very old-fashioned that way.

So at, uh, some point,
you probably had a thing for me too.

No. Not really.

-Come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
-Not that I can think of.

Think harder.

Nope. I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants.

Or in this case, doesn't. l mean, at all.

What?

[SlNGlNG] Ye who now will bless the poor
<i>Shall yourselves find blessing</i>

Ba-da-bum!

Done?

I think the word you're looking for
is "bravo."

Okay, you leave the room and find yourself
standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

Melted snowmen? Are there carrots
and lumps of coal in the water?

-Uh, what's the difference?
-It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.

-Paint a picture.
-Fine. You leave the room and find yourself...

...standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
There are carrots and coal in the water.

Do we know what happened to the top hats
and the corncob pipes?

-You see those too.
-Oh, it's like l'm really there.

I gotta tell you,
this is the most holiday fun l've had...

...since my therapist
changed my anxiety medication...

...and I stopped caring about the blood
in my stool.

Good story.

-What're you drinking there? Little eggnog?
-Yes. ls there a problem?

No, it's nice to see you enjoying
a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmasy.

Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?

Eggs are available all year round.
I've been known to enjoy this poolside.

Come on, Sheldon.
You know all the Christmas stories...

...and the carols, you've got
an eggnog mustache going on there.

Just admit it,
you're getting a little yuletide spirit.

Don't be silly. Christmas is a bunch of
baloney created by the tinsel industry.

Why is this so important to you?

I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid.
I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them.

-What was so bad about them?
-I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.

Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies,
we had to leave him a research paper.

And in the morning, you could tell he'd been
there because the paper would be graded.

No wonder you love Christmas.
That sounds amazing.

It wasn't amazing.
I got a C-minus four years in a row.

I'm familiar with your work.
C-minus was your gift.

Amy, l'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

It's fine. l'm used to being the girl
who never gets looked at twice.

I didn't have my first kiss until l was 22.

The guy only did it
so I'd give him back his insulin.

[POP MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

Sometimes the pancreas wants
what the pancreas wants.

Forget it.
I don't expect you guys to understand.

I understand.

In seventh grade, l played spin-the-bottle
and it landed on Alina Shankar.

She said if I came near her,
she would break the bottle and cut me.

You think that's bad?

In college, l passed out at a frat party
and woke up with more clothes on.

Sometimes I get so lonely I sit
on my left hand until it goes numb...

...then l put it in my right hand and pretend
I'm holding hands with another person.

I do that too.

Sometimes the left hand tries
to cop a feel.

And I let it.

It's kind of nice to talk to someone who
understands what it feels like to be alone.

It is, isn't it?

But you're not alone anymore.
Now you've got Sheldon.

I do. And don't worry,
someday you'll have somebody too.

Thank you. l hope she's half as lovely
and amazing as you are.

Thank you, Rajesh.

He wants me, l'm good. We can go.

-Damn it.
PENNY: What?

Now that l know she doesn't like me,
I'm kind of into her.

All right, I think l cracked the code
to lower the drawbridge.

HOWARD:
Great. Let's do it.

[PLAYING JINGLE BELLS]

The drawbridge is lowering.

-My carpal tunnel's acting up.
-Play through the pain.

You did it. The drawbridge is down.

You cross the chasm
and find yourself in a small dungeon room.

And in the corner, chained to the wall,
you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.

He says, "Ho, ho, help me."

Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved.

Don't ever tell my mother l said that.

I take out my skeleton key
and run to Santa to unchain him.

But first l cast a spell of paralysis
on Stuart and Howard.

-What are you doing?
-Can't talk, you're paralyzed.

I get right up in Santa's big, fat face
and say:

"Well, well, well, Jolly old Saint Nick,
we meet again.

I believe the last time we spoke was
in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas...

...when l was 5 years old, isn't that right?"

Okay.

My mother dragged me there
and plopped me down on your lap...

...and you asked me
what I wanted for Christmas.

I told you my Pop-Pop, because
that was the year my grandfather died.

I missed him and I wanted him back.

This is weird, right?

Pop-Pop was the only one in my family
who encouraged me to pursue science.

But you didn't bring him back, did you?

No. Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.

Now, you can build a lot of neat things
out of Lincoln Logs...

...but Pop-Pop ain't one of them.

And now you're here asking me
for something. To save you.

Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle.
But today's not your day.

I'm leaving you here to rot
and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.

I take the skeleton key,
toss it into the chasm...

...and on the way out give Santa a swift kick
in his bowl full ofjelly.

Okay.

So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed,
Santa's dead...

...and I picked this over having sex
with my girlfriend.

-Santa?
-Oh, hello, Sheldon.

[BELLS JlNGLlNG]

You should be asleep.

Well, then you shouldn't have jingle bells
on your boots.

I've been wanting to talk to you.

I'm sorry I disappointed you
when you were a little boy.

I can do a lot of magical things...

...but unfortunately bringing
your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.

-I understand.
-But l do have something special for you.

Close your eyes.

Oh, I hope it's a train.

Oh, it's better than a train.

Two trains?

Better.

-I'm getting three trains.
-Okay, open them.

This is for leaving me in the dungeon
to be eaten alive by ogres.

Now, hang on. In my defense--

Ho, ho, ho, you big dork.

[GASPS]

[English - US - SDH]

SHELDON:
I must say, Leonard...

...when l first heard your idea
for Giant Jenga l was skeptical.

I can't blame you,
Tiny Twister was a complete bust.

Oh. But l was wrong.

The looming threat of being crushed
under a pile of lumber...

...does add a certain spice.

I've never felt so alive.

[CHUCKLES]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Oh, hello, Alex. Let me go get you
last night's recordings.

What recordings?

Remember when you told me
I talk in my sleep?

It occurred to me that like most things l say,
it's probably pure gold.

So I started recording it all and...

...now Alex gets to comb through...

...eight hours of what l like to call
"Sheldon After Dark."

-Hey, Leonard.
-Hey.

Just playing a little Giant Jenga.

I know, I'm the one who
had to buy him the helmet.

So do you have plans this weekend?

Most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out
where to put this game when we're done.

How about you?

I'm gonna go hear Kip Thorne give a
lecture about subatomic space-time.

Oh, that's his take on John Wheeler's
quantum foam. That should be great.

Well, you can come with me.

I'd love to, but l'm supposed to
hang out with Penny.

-Well, bring her.
-Oh, she's not really into in that kind of stuff.

Well, if you want to hear about the lecture,
I can tell you all about it at work...

...or, you know, over dinner sometime.

What?

Giant Jenga! l win!

Oh, come on, that can't be true.

I did the research. Tony the Tiger...

...Dig 'Em the frog, Cap'N Crunch, Toucan
Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit...

...Snap, Crackle and Pop.

Not one cereal mascot is a girl.

It's a total breakfast sausage fest.

Are we done with this?

Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry,
Sugar Bear, and the Honey Nut Cheerio Bee.

I believe his name is Buzz.

Terrific. Something weird happened
and I don't know what to do about it.

-What's going on?
-Sheldon's assistant...

...asked me on a date.

How could you do that to me?

You know l've been working it
with Alex for weeks.

Working it? You can't even talk to her.

I talk with my eyes.

You look like my little cousin when
he's dropping one in his diaper.

She knows l have a girlfriend.
It's so weird.

Oh, my God. You're loving this!

To my bones.

[CHUCKLlNG]

I'm not gonna do anything about it.
I love Penny.

It's just nice to have a young, attractive
woman sniffing around the goods.

I both hate you and want to be you.
This is Ryan Gosling all over again.

Aww. Gentlemen. What is on the
conversational menu this morning?

Leonard stole my woman,
and he knew...

...I was only six to eight months away
from making my move.

I didn't steal anyone.

Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk
and he loves it.

Well, that's not acceptable. l'm her boss.

She needs to be solely focused
on my needs...

...not distracted by your pasty,
androgynous brand of sexuality.

I'm androgynous?

Oh, please. Look at you with your
pouty bee-stung lips.

What do you think l should do?

I say you tell Alex your heart
belongs to Penny.

I provide her a shoulder to cry on,
then roughly half a year later...

...I give it to her good.

I want to thank you all for coming on such
short notice. ln the past...

...I've reached out to each of you
individually...

...but l believe my present situation
requires the collective wisdom of the group.

Which, as you can see from
your commemorative t-shirts, l've dubbed...

...Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.

What is happening?

I need your advice about a delicate
workplace situation.

To protect those involved,
I'll be changing their names.

Who's involved?

A short, bespectacled colleague of mine...

...who lives in the shadow
of his brilliant roommate.

Uh.... Let's call this colleague
Ricardo Shilly-Shally.

-You're talking about Leonard.
-No, no.

Shilly-Shally has red hair and
briefly served in the Mexican Navy.

Anyway, despite the fact
that he has a girlfriend...

...Shilly-Shally has been the recipient...

...of inappropriate workplace flirtations
from a young lady.

-It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
-No.

No, it's Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.

What the hell is going on
with Leonard and Alex?

I'm sorry, who's talking about
Leonard and Alex?

Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.

It's not really about
Ricardo and Tondelaya.

It is really about her boss...

...who doesn't quite know how to handle
this situation and could use your advice...

...which is surprising, because
Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

...he's usually pretty smart
about these things.

Ugh. I'm gonna kill her!

You've got nothing to worry about.
Leonard would never cheat on you.

She's right. But say the word, l got a lab
full of cocaine-addicted monkeys...

...with nothing to lose.

One of them could end up
in the back seat of her car.

Or her shower.

Ladies, ladies, please.
We're not here to talk about Penny.

We're here to talk about me.
I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm! Darn it.

All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

Let me explain what's going on.
Ricardo is really Leon--

We know what's going on, Sheldon!

But what should I do?

Alex is your employee.
If she's doing something that's...

...making Leonard uncomfortable,
you should talk to her.

Oh, he's not uncomfortable at all.
He's loving it.

He's strutting around
like he's 5-foot-6.

What? He's loving it?

Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex
right away.

Talk to her. That's all you've got?

With a cool name like
Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies...

...I really expected more.

Give me back the t-shirts.

Alex, check my schedule.
What does my afternoon look like?

I think it's pretty wide open. Oh, wait.
Here's something at 4:00.

"Give Alex a talking to"?

Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?

-Is there a problem?
-Let's not call it a problem...

...let's call it an opportunity.

To solve a serious problem.

What did l do?

You don't know? Oh, you poor dear.

Your ovaries are squirting so much
goofy juice into your brain...

...you don't know which way is up.

You made an inappropriate
sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.

What? l didn't make a sexual advance
on anybody.

Now, there's no need to get defensive.

I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.

My father used to say
that a woman is like...

...an egg salad sandwich
on a warm Texas day.

What?

Full of eggs and only appealing
for a short time.

This conversation
is making me uncomfortable.

Yeah, you and me both, sister.

Please understand, I don't hold you
responsible for your behavior.

From an evolutionary standpoint,
you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.

But during the work day...

...when you feel possessed
by amorous intent, may l suggest...

...you suppress it by leafing through
this illustrated book...

...of sexually transmitted diseases.

[SHELDON SPEAKlNG lNDISTINCTLY]

Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.

I have to go.

So does this fellow, but he
can't without it burning like hot soup.

[LEONARD WHlSTLING]

Hey, pretty lady.

You seem extra happy.

-I guess l am.
-Any particular reason why?

No, just having a good day.

This morning Sheldon fell asleep
on the way to work...

...so l got to listen to the radio.
That was crazy.

Mm-hm. Anything else?

Mm.... I found this quiz online called
"Which Star Trek Character Are You?"

It only took me four tries
to get Captain Kirk. Heh.

-That's great.
-Oh.

[MlMlCS CAPTAIN KlRK]
It. Was.

[GlGGLES]

Hmm.
I'm glad you're having such a great day.

And the one thing that could make it
better is an evening with my special girl.

Oh, and who's that?

What do you mean?

I just didn't know if you meant me
or Alex.

Why would l mean Alex?

Because l know she hit on you
and I know you liked it!

[NERVOUSLY]
What?

Don't play dumb with me,
Ricardo Shilly-Shally!

I'm missing something.

Did you say something to Penny
about Alex?

Yes, and a fat lot of good it did me.
All she did was get mad at you.

Why would you do that?

I needed advice about a woman.

I would have asked you, but
if the last few years have proven anything...

...it's that you can't tell a uterus
from a unicycle.

At least I know not to blab to a girl
about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

Good to know.
A few more helpful hints like that...

...you may find yourself
on the Council of Ladies.

Hello?

I see. What time?

Very well, then.

Huh. That was the Human Resources
Department at the university.

Apparently my assistant, Alex,
has filed a complaint accusing me of...

...inappropriate behavior
in the workplace.

Oh, my God. What did you do?

Oh. Let me think....

Nothing, l'm a delight.

Human Resources Department.

Human Resources Department.

Human Resources Department.

Come in?

-Hello.
-Ah. Dr. Cooper, have a seat.

Thank you.

I called you in today because
your assistant...

...Alex Jensen has
lodged a complaint against you.

So I've been told. But l can't understand
what she has to complain about.

She has a front row seat as l
make scientific history...

...there's string cheese in my mini-fridge
and that's for anyone...

...and just yesterday I led her away
from a life of sexual promiscuity...

...by making her look at pictures
of disease-ridden genitalia.

Cancel my next appointment.
This is gonna take a while.

Dr. Cooper, you said things
to your employee...

...that you just cannot say
in the workplace.

Like what?

Well, according to Ms. Jensen you said...

...that she was a
"slave to her biological urges"...

...and called her an "egg salad sandwich."

I don't even know what that means...

...but l'm gonna go ahead
and tell you you can't say it.

Oh, I see the confusion here.

Alex thought I was singling her out. No.

I meant that all women
are slaves to their biological urges.

Even you.

You're a slave.

I'm a what?

I'm just saying. At a certain point
in a woman's menstrual cycle--

Uh-uh. Oh.

You can't talk about that either.

Your language is entirely inappropriate,
and I'm going to advise...

...that you shut your mouth right now.

I don't see why l'm the one being
persecuted here.

Dr. Hofstadter was bragging about his
sexual desirability...

...to anyone who would listen.

Howard Wolowitz spent two years
using university resources...

...building a six-breasted sex robot.

And at the office Christmas party,
I heard Rajesh Koothrappali...

...refer to you several times
as "Brown Sugar."

Hofstadter, Wolowitz and
that last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?

Yes. But in his defense,
that wasn't racist. He's also brown.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

[SlNGlNG]
<i>I'm sorry Alex hit on me</i>

<i>Hit on me, hit on me</i>

<i>Sorry Alex hit on me</i>
<i>I had no idea I'm cute</i>

Aw. Damn it, you are.

[CHUCKLES]

Please forgive me,
I should have told you about Alex.

I don't care about Alex. Fine, l care.

Okay, I hate the bitch.

But what really hurt
is that you liked it so much.

Do l need to be worried?

Of course not. No. Why?

Because she's pretty and smart
and when you talk about work...

...she doesn't have to look up words
in the dictionary...

...to understand what you said.

-You do that?
-No.

Hang on. Are you feeling insecure?
Because that's my thing.

And if you take it away, I don't know
what I'm bringing to this relationship.

Yes, Leonard, l am insecure. Happy?

No, I'm not happy.

Why are you smiling?

I'm sorry, it's just I never think of you
having feelings like that.

-Well, I do.
-Why?

Nothing is ever going to happen
between me and Alex.

Good.

Come here.

-Can l tell you a secret?
-What's that?

With all these women chasing me,
I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.

-Can l tell you a secret?
-Sure.

Keep talking about Captain Kirk
and we're all gonna stop.

[MlMlCS CAPTAIN KlRK]
Message. Received.

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

Excuse me.

Hello.

This is Dr. Hofstadter.

Okay.

All right, thank you.

That's weird.
I'm getting called into Human Resources.

What did you do?

I don't know.

Huh. I just got called into Human Resources.

Why?

I don't know. Heh.

Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources
wants to talk to me tomorrow.

Could you stop licking your ass
for two minutes? l have a problem here.

Do you really think
you should be drinking right now?

How else am l supposed to talk
to the human resources lady?

I don't know, seek professional help?

I did. The guy at the liquor store said
this stuff tastes great in coffee.

You got called in too? What is going on?

Sheldon threw us all under the bus.

I feel like l've been called
to the principal's office.

Although l wouldn't mind
if Brown Sugar suspended me...

...from a sex swing. Heh.

This may have been a mistake.

Relax, everything's gonna be fine.

Before l met Bernadette,
I was in here every other day.

Little tip, turn off your "l Like Big Butts"
ringtone before you go in.

-This is all your fault.
-How is this my fault?

If you weren't screwing around
with Sheldon's assistant...

-...this wouldn't have happened.
-I wasn't screwing around.

Oh, of course not, she was just
sniffing around your goods...

...because she was hunting for truffles.

Ah. Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.

Hey, Janine. Heh. How're Tom and the kids?

Fine.

You must be Dr. Hofstadter?

Yes, but I think this is all
a big misunderstanding.

Yeah, me too. l didn't do anything.

Is that alcohol on your breath?

Howard built a sex robot.

That is not true.
All l did was build a robot.

Did it have six breasts?

I'm sorry, l'm a feminist. Heh.
I don't notice things like...

...how many breasts a robot has.

Well, hello.

What are you doing here?

-Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
-And I'm a little busy right now.

But l came to file a complaint. Somebody
has made me feel uncomfortable...

...in the workplace by using language
of an inappropriate and sexual nature.

-And who is that?
-You, you dirty birdy.

I thought about the things
you said yesterday...

...and I realized l'm deeply offended.

Now, be a dear and get me
one of those complaint forms.

That's it. All of you, in my office now.

Thanks to you, l know better
than to ask if you're menstruating.

Based on your behavior, l don't have to.

It has been pointed out to me that
some of the things l said to you...

...could be construed as offensive.

And I would like to offer you
my sincerest apology.

Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

Additionally, you should know
that the university has mandated...

...that I take an online sexual harassment
seminar so that this sort of thing...

...doesn't happen in the future.

-Okay.
-Now, unfortunately...

...my time is much too valuable
to waste on nonsense like this...

...so l'm going to need you
to take it for me.

Oh, and you'd better ace it,
they're pretty mad.

-I was thinking about that stuff with Alex--
-Would you stop worrying about that?

I can't help it. But I figured
I could sit around...

...and feel insecure, or
I could do something about it.

So, l got a course catalog at school
and looked at some of the science classes.

-That's great.
-No, it isn't...

...they are extremely boring, how do you
not kill yourself, like, every day?

Anyway, I decided I don't need to be
a scientist, l could just look like one.

So I bought these.

Glasses? I really don't think
that's gonna change--

Oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!

I know, right? Watch this.

Molecules.

-Okay, come with me.
-Where are we going?

To my bedroom so l can take everything off
but those glasses.

<i>And maybe the boots.</i>

[English - US - SDH]

Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?

"Leonard, wanna go halfsies
on a steamer?"

"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

Hi. Here are the makeup
sponges you asked for.

-Oh, thanks, l thought l had more.
-Hmm.

Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

You've got better makeup than l do.
Yeah, l'm borrowing this.

Hey, hey, hey,
this is my Comic-Con makeup.

I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

That's a wise policy.

I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest...

...got a terrible case of pink eye.

Yeah, well, luckily, I was going
as a zombie, I won second place.

You guys just went to Comic-Con.

That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

-Is that better?
-Well, it's a lot smaller.

It's about the comic books.

The way these conventions used to be
before they went Hollywood.

So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

Then why are you going?

It's a comic book convention.

Like pizza or particle accelerators...

...even the stinky ones, still pretty good.

Well, you guys have fun.
I guess l'll see you Sunday.

-Yeah. Oh, hang on a second.
-Okay.

Hold this.

-What was that for?
-To show people when they don't believe me.

This is the best. You have booze with
breakfast on Tuesday, you got a problem.

You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

Can't stand a table where one person's having
an omelet and another is having a sandwich.

That's not exhausting at all.

[PHONE BEEPS]

Oh.

It's Leonard. He says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed.

Maybe it's the mimosa,
but l'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

Cute how excited they are.

You should have seen Howard
sewing his costume all week.

When did Howard learn to sew?

When he was a little boy, every couple of
months he'd have to let his mom's pants out.

I don't understand
why they go to these conventions.

The four of them work at a major university,
they're all smart...

...how can they be into something
for 12-year-olds?

I don't mind it. l think Howie's
just in touch with his inner child.

Although when he's in Batman pajamas...

...sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

It's probably because they were bullied.
In a world where you can't fight back...

...superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

Hmm. Now l feel bad for picking on
all those kids.

Although if Danny Biffle
didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt...

...he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?

PENNY: Mm-mm.
-No.

It's such an important part of their lives.

-Maybe we should try reading some.
-Seriously?

The comic book store isn't far from here.

That is an amazing idea.

Okay, how many of these have I had?

I think you should turn on the GPS.

It is on.

But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

I know l'd feel more safe
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

Has it really only been 1 0 miles?

I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.

GPS [IN SHELDON'S VOlCE]: Leonard,
<i>bear left and continue on Interstate 21 0.</i>

Ooh, sounds like that fellow
knows what he's talking about.

I'd put on my listening ears if l were you.

-What did you do?
-I found a hack online.

I was able to upload MP3 recordings
of my voice to your GPS.

-That is so cool.
-Counterpoint, no, it's not.

GPS:
<i>Continue on Interstate 21 0 for five miles.</i>

<i>Here's an interesting fact</i>
<i>about Interstates:</i>

-Really?
-Shh!

He said it's interesting.

GPS:
<i>lnterstates are numbered as follows:</i>

<i>Even-numbered routes run east and west.</i>

<i>Odd-numbered routes run</i>
<i>north and south.</i>

<i>Three-digit route numbers</i>
<i>indicate bypasses or spurs.</i>

Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.
Drive off it.

You know, we're not that far
from Vasquez Rocks.

Oh, they shot a lot of
Star Trek episodes out there.

We got our costumes in the trunk...

...we could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

Great idea. l haven't had
a carbohydrate in two weeks.

These cheekbones need to be in front of a
camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

-It sounds fun.
-Oh, smashing.

Now, Leonard,
do you know how to get there?

-No.
-Yeah, well, luckily, someone in the car does.

GPS:
<i>Recalculating.</i>

<i>While we're waiting,</i>
<i>do you know which president...</i>

<i>...signed the</i>
<i>Interstate Highway System Act into law?</i>

<i>The answer coming up in 1 4 miles.</i>

None of you will get it. It's Eisenhower.

Why are they staring?

Who cares, just soak it in.

Hello, boys.

Oh, hey.

Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.

It's nothing you haven't seen
in movies or in drawings.

-Hey, Stuart.
-What brings you guys here?

We were looking for a recommendation
about comic books.

Well, I recommend you don't
open a store and sell them.

We were wondering why the guys
like this stuff, so we thought we'd try it.

Oh, okay.
What do you think you might be into?

Superhero? Fantasy?
Graphic novels? Manga?

I swear l will turn a hose on you.

What kind of comics do the guys like?

Um, a little bit of everything.
Mostly superhero stuff.

-All right, well, who's the best superhero?
-Shh!

You can't ask a question like that in here.
Are you trying to start a rumble?

Well, what do you recommend?

Well, uh, let's see, you've got your basic
clean-cut good guys:

Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America.

Then you have your darker anti-heroes:

Your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.

Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

As evidenced by your boyfriend
and his fear of hamsters.

If I were you,
I'd go for Fables number one.

Artwork is sophisticated,
it's intelligently written...

...and it doesn't objectify...

-...or stereotype women.
-Oh, Thor. He's hot.

Yeah, he kind of is.

And we're blending...

...and we're blending, and we're done.

I know Mr. Data isn't supposed
to smile, but here it comes.

Come on, guys, let's do this.

Yeah, l'm sweating my bald cap off.

What's our first pose gonna be?

I say we begin with a classic
Star Trek fight scene.

I'll set the timer.

Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?

Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

I'm wielding it.

Phasers on the Borg!

Charlie's Angels!

Okay, what's next?

Now let's do some sexy glamour shots.

I'll set the mood.

[SCATTlNG]

Yeah, nice one.

That's right.

[CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT
THEN ENGINE REVS]

Oh, my God.
Leonard, someone's stealing your car!

What? Hey! Hey, come back here!

-Stop!
-Stealing is against the law!

I don't believe this.

Son of a bitch.

I'll call 91 1 .

Oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.

-Mine too.
-So is mine.

Anybody got any ideas?

Nope. The only thing left to do now
is assign blame.

Nice going.

What kind of a person steals
another person's car in broad daylight?

What kind of person
leaves his keys in the car?

Thought we agreed
it's Koothrappali's fault.

You're right.

Nice going.

Car.

What is wrong with people?
Why don't they stop?

Maybe we're better off.

What if we were to get in a car
with a crazy person?

Look at us, Sheldon.
We're the crazy people.

Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign...

...that assures passing motorists
of our mental competence.

Good idea.
Why don't you get started on that?

Come on, let's just start walking.

There's gotta be a gas station
or something nearby.

What, you think just because you're wearing
a captain's uniform you're in charge?

Yes.

All right.

Okay, I'm done.

-How did you guys finish so fast?
-I don't know, there were a lot of pictures.

And one page only had the word
"brakka-dooom!"

Yeah, well, l have street smarts.

So, what'd you guys think?

-Well, there was a lot of action.
PENNY: Hmm.

And the story moved along
at a brisk pace.

It was, overall,
what's the word I'm looking for...?

-Stupid?
-So stupid.

I don't know how Leonard
can get so caught up.

It's crazy. They spend hours arguing
about things that don't even exist.

-What a waste of time.
-I know.

A hammer so heavy
that no one else can pick it up?

[SCOFFS]

I don't think it's heavy, l think it's some
sort of magic so only Thor can lift it.

That makes even less sense, l mean....

No, no, no, it doesn't.

Thor is a god. The hammer is his.
Only he can use it.

It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

Or his thin, beckoning lips.

Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand
is on the hammer?

If he's touching it with his god magic,
then does that mean l could lift it?

-No.
-Yes.

Well, which is it?

-Maybe we missed something.
-Let's read it again.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

-You want some tea?
-Good idea. I'll help you.

-Wait, l thought we were reading?
-We are.

We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

I wish my mom was here.

We could all hang out in her shadow.

Wool pants in the desert.

I feel like l've got poached testicles.

Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating.

That's so much worse
than having your car stolen.

Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.
It's not gonna de-funk my junk.

Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching.

We're Starfleet officers
and a member of the Borg Collective.

Please, Sheldon, l am so not in the mood.

Leonard...

...all our lives
we have dreamed of finding ourselves...

...inside one of the fantasy worlds
we love.

And look at us.

At this moment, we are, in fact,
a Star Trek landing party...

...stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment.

Relying only on our wits,
our fortitude and our moxie.

As long as we have those things...

-...nothing can stop us--
MAN: Nerds!

I hate this planet.

It says right here on the hammer:

"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be
worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."

Hold on. Who decides who's worthy?
Does the hammer decide?

-Yes!
-No!

-It can't decide, it's a hammer.
-You said it's a magic hammer!

Yeah, but it can't make decisions.

If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,
why can't Thor's hammer?

Okay, if you're gonna start comparing wands
and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.

Hello.

Hello.

Four glasses of water, please.

Anything for you guys?

Can l use your phone?
Our car got stolen.

Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

[ALL LAUGHING]

Scotty was on the original series
<i>and we're Next Generation.</i>

So joke's on you.

We're not with him.

You can't pick something up
in outer space.

In space, there is no up.

Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come up every day?

Hard to argue
with those kind of street smarts.

Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics.
Why don't we go look at those?

Oh, great. And then you will see,
I am not wrong.

If we were in outer space,
anyone could pick up the hammer...

...because it would be floating
in a weightless environment.

Yeah, that's right,
the slow reader used science. Suck on that.

-Was there anything valuable in the car?
-Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

And about $300 worth of makeup...

...so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

Makeup? Sure.

We're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.
They have a big costume contest.

It's cooler than it sounds.

I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

It is. lt's not just comic books.

They've got action figures,
toys, a Tron themed dance party--

Okay, he gets how cool it is.

I think I have all I need here.
You guys need me to call someone?

I'm guessing your moms?

Thanks, but we've got it covered.

Okay, I just talked to my mom.

She arranged for us to get a rental car.

Great, we can still make it to Comic-Con.

Are you kidding me? After all we've
been through? I just want to go home.

Don't be like that.
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

I'm with Leonard. I'm done.

Fine, then l guess it's two against two.
How do we decide?

Actually, it's three against one.

What? Well, what about the mission?
You said we're a real-life landing party.

Well, we're not.

We're an imaginary landing party.

Who had real-life garbage thrown at us
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

And to tell you the truth,
I'm starting to feel like one.

I want to go home now.

Okay.

Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

Get it? Enterprise? Heh.

Screw you, that's funny.

Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor
while Thor is holding the hammer?

-Yeah?
-Then by the transitive property...

...of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

No, Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

Hang on, if I go to a bar and pick
up a guy, and he picks up a girl...

...and then we all leave together,
did l pick up the girl?

Did that ever happen?

Hey, we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

AMY: Look right here,
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer...

...because Thor is touching it.

PENNY:
No, it's because they're in space!

BERNADETTE: He's touching the strap.
AMY: The strap's part of the hammer!

PENNY:
No, it's not!

Are they actually
arguing about comic books?

No, that can't be right.

Maybe Thor's Hammer
is a new color of nail polish.

BERNADETTE:
Then Red Hulk must be worthy!

PENNY:
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

BERNADETTE:
You don't know his life.

There's only one logical explanation:
Somewhere in the desert...

...we crossed into
an alternate dimension...

...where the women in our lives
can finally appreciate great literature.

If it's an alternate dimension...

...that sounds like a job
for a landing party.

Captain, what are your orders?

I say we investigate.

Wait.

They might be hostile.

Fine, but set them to stun.

If we vaporize Penny, l'll never
find a girlfriend that pretty again.

GPS:
<i>Fun fact:</i>

<i>President Eisenhower</i>
<i>signed the Federal Aid Highway Act...</i>

<i>...from his hospital room.</i>

Wow, that is interesting.

You learn something new every day.

<i>GPS: Say, can you name the four state capitals</i>
<i>that are not served by the lnterstate System?</i>

-Ooh, another quiz?
-Yes!

[English - US - SDH]

Sheldon, your food's getting cold.

I'll eat later. Right now I'm suckling at the
informative bosom of mother physics.

It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.

So I found this website
where you send them pictures...

...they sculpt your head
and make an action figure out of you.

-How awesome is that?
-Let me see.

You can pick your wardrobe,
you can choose your accessories.

Oh, Leonard,
you can get a little asthma inhaler.

Oh, this is neat.

Think about all the action figures
we've bought.

It would be kind of cool
to have one that look like us.

Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool,
you should get one.

Yeah, so l'm out.

What do you think?
Want an action figure that looks like you?

-Would it come with kung-fu grip?
-No.

Don't waste my time.

You get that these
are personalized action figures.

Honey, if you want one, just get one.

-You're still out, right?
-Yup.

A hush falls over the crowd
as Cooper studies the board.

He makes his move.

He's dividing both sides by l,
he's adding back the coefficient.

He has a value for P.
He's plugging that back in.

He takes the derivative
and he solves the equation.

<i>-Crowd goes wild. "Nobel, Nobel!"</i>
-Cooper.

"Nobel." Kripke.

Yeah-- Don't look at my board.

-What's that?
-That's a drawing of a really cool train.

Yeah, don't look at that, either.

-What do you want?
-I have some bad news.

You're working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

I'm working on a grant proposal
for a new fusion reactor.

The university is only allowed
to submit one proposal.

So they asked you to pack up your things
and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry.

You're one of the good ones.

No, they're making us work together.

That's ridiculous.

I am one of the great minds
of our generation.

I work on a level so rarified,
you couldn't even imagine it.

I said, stop looking at my cool train!

Hm. A strange place to put a picture
of you and Bernadette.

Well, I've wanted everybody
to know l love my wife, you know...

...and nobody to know
I forgot to turn off the laser.

They're here.
Our action figures have arrived.

It's the best $500 l've ever spent.

A thousand dollars on action figures?
How can you afford that?

Easy. His family is loaded
and Bernadette has a great job.

My wife came with both funbags
and moneybags.

Say hello to an exact-scale model of me.

Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.

I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.

Oh, man.

Look at my nose.

Maybe it's a shipping problem.

-What?
-Yeah.

Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam
just got action figures and look like you. Heh.

-This sucks.
-I can't believe I wasted all that money.

Aw, and my girlfriend
wouldn't let me get one.

Look at my face.

Do l look smug? I feel smug.

I hate it when you make me sit
through the credits.

Well, sometimes there's a secret ending,
like in The Avengers.

PENNY: Yeah, but l don't think that's gonna
happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.

They could show bloopers.

[JOHN WlLLlAMS' "IMPERIAL MARCH"
PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS]

-Oh, no.
-What is that?

That is Sheldon's "l'm unhappy
and about to destroy the planet" music.

-Let's just go to your place.
-If he's unhappy, shouldn't we talk to him?

"Shouldn't we talk to him?"
Have you learned nothing in six years?

You doing okay, sweetie?

There's ominous music playing
and there's an afghan over my head.

I don't know where you're from, but where
I'm from, that means l'm not doing okay.

-I'm gonna make you some tea.
-Tea is for when l'm upset. l'm not upset.

The university is forcing me
to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.

So cocoa?

Yes, cocoa.

Do you have any idea what it's like
to be paired with someone so annoying?

Oh, teacher, me, me.

You see, l did all this great work
and now he's just gonna come and ruin it.

I'm angrier than ever
and filled with despair.

-What beverage do you make for that?
-Oh, no, no, no, I know this.

-Hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
-Hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks.

What the frig, Cooper?

We were supposed to be in my office
half an hour ago.

And yet now you're in my office.
Point Cooper.

Welcome to the thunderdome, Kripke.

We agreed to exchange copies of our work.
Let me see yours.

Why don't you show me yours first?

You think I just fell off the turnip truck?

We exchange at the same time.

How do l know you're not going
to take my ideas and publish them?

How do l know you're not gonna?

Yeah, because l'm not interested
in getting published in MAD Magazine.

The zingers fly fast
in the thunderdome, Barry.

Are we gonna do this or not?

Thank you. So we read each other's work
and meet again tomorrow?

Fine.

Nice try. This is blank paper.

And I'm sure it's still more valuable
than whatever's in here.

-Cough it up, Cooper.
-Very well.

If this one's blank too,
I'm gonna be furious.

Fine.

[lN DEEP VOICE]
Yo, always bet on black.

Get that waste of money out of my face.

[lN NORMAL VOICE] It's only a waste of money
if we don't play with them.

[lN DEEP VOICE]
He's right, dog.

Please, I'm working.

[lN NORMAL VOICE] You know, there is a way
we can get action figures to look exactly like us.

Oh, yeah? How's that?

Two words: 3D printer.

But maybe it's three words.
No, hang on. Okay.

One word, a letter and a number,
and maybe a hyphen.

3D printer.

I have always wanted a 3D printer.

Of course you have.
They're an engineer's dream.

Anything you can design,
a 3D printer can make out of plastic.

Yeah, but they're so expensive.

Oh, come on, you deserve one.

You've worked hard to find a woman
who makes a lot of money.

Well, the prices have been coming down.

Oh, true.
They're practically giving them away.

You know, in exchange for money.

And we could make stuff we need
for work with it.

Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs,
specialized tools.

Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali
and his totally bitching dream house.

We don't need
Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.

Really, smart guy? Where is he supposed
to park his sweet little Corvette?

The monkey in my tobacco study
has taken to smoking a pipe.

I'm supposed to remove his brain
to examine...

...but it's hard, because now
he reminds me of my uncle.

You've been awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?

I'm fine.

All right. Well, how was work today?

Did you exchange your research
with Kripke?

Yes.

Sheldon, what's going on?

I read his research and...

...it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.

Which means the mommy
of the smartest physicist at the university...

...is not my mommy as l had thought.

It's his mommy.

Sheldon, l wish there was something
I could do to make you feel better.

May I offer you a consoling hug?

What do we have to lose?

[WHlMPERlNG]

How's that?

I feel like l'm being strangled
by a boa constrictor.

Why'd you stop?

Come on, Sheldon, we're gonna be late.

I can't go in today, l'm sick.

You're not sick.
You don't wanna face Kripke.

No. Look.

One hundred and 28.

See?

-What did you do? Put this in your tea?
-Oh, dear.

Now l'm not even smarter than you.

Sheldon, Kripke is not smarter than you.
You just got stuck on a wrong path.

Happened to Einstein. He got stuck
in the unified field theory for decades.

Oh, don't play the Einstein card.

His breakthroughs happened
when no one knew anything.

Everything was a great breakthrough.

Sheldon Lee Cooper,
I do not have time for this nonsense.

Go put your clothes on,
get in the car, and let's go to work.

All right, jeez.

What a grouch.

How did I do that?
I gotta remember how l did that.

Do you realize by owning a 3D printer...

...we are reclaiming
the manufacturing process...

...and taking jobs back
from sweatshops in China.

I think this thing was made in China.

Eh, what can you do?

Ooh, I think it's done.

[GASPS]

It worked.

We printed a whistle.

Amazing.

You realize these things go
for 25 cents a pop at a party store.

And we made it in only three hours.

[WHlSTLE BLOWS]

-Sounds just like store-bought.
-Heh, heh.

Okay, give me a superhero pose...

...and I will scan you into the computer
for your action figure.

Oh, I wish l was in better shape.

[SCOFFS]

Stop holding your stomach in,
I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.

Oh, okay, great.

Now, l can look like Val Kilmer
as Batman...

...instead of Val Kilmer
as he looks today.

All right. You can suck it in a little bit.

Cooper, we have a problem.

Your work is really not
at the level I expected it to be.

I know. Go ahead and mock me.

But use small words so I understand.

Don't play dumb with me.
We both know what your problem is.

-We do?
-You have a girlfriend.

-So?
-So my work would suffer too...

...if l was getting laid all the time.

Yes.

That is the reason.

My work is suffering because of...

...all the laid I'm getting.

You lucky bastard.

What can l say?
You know, she enjoys my genitals.

I am giving them to her
on a nightly basis.

Okay, stop bragging.

You had some brilliant insights in here.
But if we'll make this work...

-...you need to buckle down and focus.
-Yeah, l'll do what I can.

But it's not going to be easy
because when I'm with Amy...

...and our bathing suit areas
mush together...

...because it-- Boy, howdy. --is it magic.

Oh, good, you're home.

Got a little surprise for you.

Oh!

Say hello to my little friend.

Oh, my God, it's so cute.

I didn't think there could be
a smaller version of you.

I know, right?

And thanks to photographs
and a little 3D modeling...

...here comes the bride.

-Oh, Howie, l love these.
-I thought you might.

-Were they expensive?
-It didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.

-How?
-Koothrappali and l...

...bought a used 3D printer for $5000.

Heh, heh.

Five thousand dollars for a couple of dolls?
Are you out of your mind?

Not just a couple of dolls.

For as many dolls as we want.

And whistles.

At any point did it dawn on you to talk
to me about spending this kind of money?

It's kind of dawning on me now.

I don't believe you.

Howie, we can't afford to waste money
on junk like this.

What are you talking about?
We make plenty of money.

I make plenty of money.
You make peanuts.

Well, yes, but we're married now.

That means when you get sick,
I take care of you.

And when you make a bunch of money...

...I get to buy stuff.

Sorry if you don't like it,
but that's how love works.

No. Here's how love works.
You're gonna return the machine...

...or you could print out a working set
of lady parts and sleep with those.

Oh, my God.
Are you actually thinking about it?

I don't understand.
Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?

Because the truth made me look bad.

Whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie
makes me look good.

Anyway, if Kripke asks...

...tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent,
intense and whimsically inventive.

Is my coitus whimsically inventive?

That is what l write
on the bathroom walls.

"For a whimsically inventive time,
call Leonard Hofstadter."

[CHUCKLlNG]

I know you're joking,
but l'd be okay with that.

-Sheldon, can l ask you a question?
-Of course.

Are you ever gonna sleep with Amy?

-That's awfully personal.
-We don't ask Sheldon things like that.

Maybe you don't, l do. What's the deal?

Well, word around the university is...

...I'm giving her sex organs
a proper jostling.

All right, come on, be serious.
You have been going out a long time.

She would clearly like
to have a physical relationship with you.

So, what are you doing?

All right, we're down the rabbit hole.
What are you doing?

Well, first of all, l'm quite fond of Amy.

Then what's the problem?

Penny...

...all my life I have been uncomfortable...

...with the sort of physical contact
that comes easily to others...

...handshaking, hugging...

...prostate exams.

But l'm working on it, you know?

Just recently, l had to put VapoRub
on Amy's chest.

A year ago,
that would have been unthinkable.

Now you know how l feel
when l have to put it on you.

Okay, hang on.

Are you saying
someday you and Amy might...

...actually get physical?

It's a possibility.

Oh, my God.

Sheldon, l know this wasn't easy
and I'm glad we can have this conversation.

-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

Sure you wanna do this?

-Give up your half of the 3D printer?
-Yes.

And can you please make that out
to Bernadette?

I was taken off the joint account
until l learn the value of money.

Well, that's harsh.

Tell me about it.

Aren't you gonna eat lunch?

No, I blew my food allowance
on PokÃ©mon cards.

Well, the equation balances,
but it's certainly not elegant.

Whatever. You get any last night?

Yes.

Gave it to her good, huh?

No, I gave it to her well.

Now, over here l was thinking...

-...turbulence could be reduced if we put--
-Yeah, yeah.

Was she naked,
or was she wearing lingerie?

I didn't notice.

How could you not notice?

I was too busy squishing
all the desirable parts of her body.

Oh, you're killing me, Cooper!

Can we get back to work?

Sure, sure, sure.

You guys ever used any toys?

Toys?

I do have a model rocket next to my bed.

A rocket? You're a freak. l love it.

[English - US - SDH]

I don't know why l avoided the Harry Potter
books for so long. These are great.

-I just started number six.
-That's a good one.

Dumbledore dies in that one.

Yeah, l know, I didn't see it coming, either.

Why would you say that?

You brought up a subject,
I contributed a fact on that subject.

It's called the art of conversation.
Okay, your turn.

That was a huge spoiler.

Good.

What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

Really, Leonard?
Gonna have one of your hissy fits?

Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

Yes. And l have a theory why.

Because of your lactose intolerance,
you switched over to soy milk.

Soy contains estrogen-mimicking
compounds.

I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
are turning you into a hysterical woman.

You are unbelievable.
I don't know why l put up with you.

-You're controlling, you're irritating--
-There you go again. Nag, nag, nag.

You're only proving my point, little lady.

You know what, screw you, Sheldon.

You're the most annoying person
I've ever met.

I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time.

"Sheldon, don't talk about
your bowel movements over breakfast."

"Sheldon, when the president
of the university...

...is giving a eulogy at a funeral,
don't yawn and point at your watch."

"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts
because they're ugly."

You're impossible.

That's it, l don't have to put up with this.

Actually, I have your signature
on a roommate agreement that says you do.

Aww. Here's what l think
of your roommate agreement.

[GASPS]

-You pick that up right now.
-No.

Roommate agreement,
section 27, paragraph 5:

"The roommate agreement, like the
American flag, cannot touch the ground."

I don't care.

I don't have to do anything you say, because
I don't think I wanna live here anymore.

-Where are you going?
-To live with Penny...

...not you, you crazy bastard.

-Crazy bastard?
-Yes.

-Leonard, wait.
-What?

Dobby the Elf dies in book seven.

Here you go.

-Great. Come on in.
-What, you don't say thank you?

It's my suitcase.
I lent it to you two years ago.

I should tell you
I broke the wheel and the handle.

So is everyone from Bernadette's company
going to Vegas?

No, just me, her,
and a couple of the bigwigs.

It's part of a bonus she got.

Cool. Did she discover a cure
for something?

Not exactly. They spent a ton of money
developing this dandruff medication...

...that had the side effect
of horrible anal leakage.

Is there a good anal leakage?

Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand
the stuff as a cure for constipation.

Way to make lemonade, you know, from
around the corner where fudge is made.

-Hey, I got a favor to ask.
-Sure.

My mom's been
kind of an emotional wreck...

...since that dentist she was dating
dumped her.

Dumped her? What did he use, a forklift?

Sorry.

There's nothing funny
about morbid obesity.

She's huge, it was funny.

Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you
could check in on her tomorrow night...

-...make sure she's doing okay.
-Dude, I'm a single man.

Saturday night is my party night.

Really, what do you got going on?

I don't know, maybe drive
down to Hollywood...

...hit a few hot spots,
see if l can get lucky.

Tell me if this sounds familiar. Ahem.

You pay $1 5 to park,
you stand on the sidewalk for an hour...

...until you break down and
give the bouncer 20 to let you in.

You push your way to the bar
where you drink an $1 8 cosmopolitan.

Then you stare at a pretty girl
and imagine your perfect life together.

Children, grandchildren.
Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy...

...who claims he wrote
<i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua.</i>

Then you give up on love,
go to Marie Callender's...

...buy a pie and eat it in your car
in the parking lot.

-What time should I be at your mother's?
-I told her around 7.

I swear, that man is the most egotistical,
insufferable human being I have ever met.

Yeah, but you two
make such a cute couple.

Like Bert and Ernie.

You guys even teach me stuff
about words and numbers.

Well, I've had it, l am done.

I can't live with him one more minute.

Wow, where are you gonna go?

Well, I was thinking here with you.

Oh.

Is that a problem?

No, no, no. It's great.

It's terrific. You know, l just can't
help feel bad about Sheldon.

I mean, how's he gonna
get by without you...

...Ernie?

-He's got Amy now.
-Yeah, he does...

-...but it's not the same.
-Why?

Um....

Well, all right, you know how
<i>in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince...</i>

...Ron didn't abandon Harry
because Harry started dating Ron's sister?

Harry and Ginny get together?

Sorry, spoiler alert. My point is,
as much as l want to live with you...

...I can't do it knowing how much
Sheldon needs you.

Please. The only thing he needs me for
is to be his whipping boy.

His stooge, his doormat.

Well, you know what they say,
if it ain't broke....

Wow, it sounds to me like
you don't want us to live together.

No. No, no, l do. I do.
It's just-- lt's a really big step.

Is it? We're together all the time.
Financially, it makes great sense.

Can you think of one reason
why we shouldn't do this?

Well, um....

Heh. I'm just a little thirsty.

I got nothing.

Great. l'll go get my stuff.

Okay. All right, don't freak out.
You can make this work.

Oh. Could you clear off a shelf for me
in the bathroom? l take a lot of medicine.

Oh, please, let some of it be Xanax.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Are you ready for dessert?

No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.

As is, l'm going to have to carry
my stomach out of here...

...like l'm a fireman rescuing an infant.

Oh, please, you're a tall glass
of brown water.

-Have dessert.
-I really couldn't.

But l've had a lovely time eating your
brisket and hearing about the things...

...you've had removed from your body
over the years.

I didn't know you could have
a cyst inside another cyst.

The doctor said they were like
Russian nesting dolls.

Well, if you have to go, how about
I put a little doggie bag together for you?

That would be lovely, thank you.

[MRS. WOLOWlTZ CRlES]

Mrs. Wolowitz...

...are you okay?

Don't mind me.

I just cry when l'm lonely
and have nothing to live for.

I....

I suppose I could stay for some dessert.

Great. You like
chocolate chip cheesecake?

-Sure.
-I'll make one.

One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure.

-That's Leonard's.
-Children's toy.

<i>One Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>
phaser.

That's Leonard's.

Children's toy.

<i>One Game of Thrones</i>
collector's edition Longclaw sword.

Leonard and I bought that together.

That's a bit of an ethical conundrum.

I'll keep it.

So, what's your plan moving forward?

I suppose I'll have to find and cultivate
a new roommate.

What a task that will be.

Do you know how uncivilized
Leonard was when l took him in?

-No.
-It took me forever...

...to get him on a bathroom schedule.

He would just go
whenever the mood struck him.

-Like a dog boy.
-Exactly.

What if you could find a roommate
who was a scientist...

...and already familiar and comfortable
with your ways?

That would be ideal.

If a person like that existed,
I would sign on, no further questions asked.

Great, here I am.

Wait.

Here who is where?

Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?

-Um....
-Think about it, Sheldon.

I'm not a stranger,
we're intellectually compatible...

...I'm willing to chauffeur you around,
and your personality quirks...

...which others find abhorrent
or rage-inducing, l find cute as a button.

What do you think?

Um....

Tell me one reason
why this isn't a fantastic idea.

Um....

See? You can't.

I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room
is big enough for my water bed.

Um....

Good buddy Leonard?
Good buddy Leonard.

Good buddy Leonard?

-What do you want?
-Hey, good buddy.

So I was just talking to Amy...

...and she made me realize
that this little dust-up...

...between you and me
is much ado about nothing.

-Is that so?
-Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home.

I'll make you some soy hot chocolate
and then I'll tell you about...

...our exciting new
devil-may-care bathroom policy.

Cut to the chase, Sheldon.

Okay. Amy has decided
she wants to move in with me...

...so l need you to come back home,
you lovable scamp.

That's a lot of product.

-Hey. What's going on?
-Get this.

Suddenly, Sheldon wants me back
because Amy wants to move in with him.

Really? lnteresting.

Well, too late, pal, I'm not going anywhere.

Penny and l are very happy living together.
Isn't that right?

It's like the happiness
won't ever leave the apartment.

Leonard, please,
you know Amy moving in...

...marks a level of intimacy
our relationship isn't ready for.

Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't
mean you don't care about each other...

...it just means things are moving at a pace
you're not comfortable with. And that's fine.

If he doesn't wanna live with her,
he should tell her how he feels.

Maybe he doesn't know how to say it
without hurting her feelings.

Feelings? Who am l,
a hippie at a love-in? No.

The problem is she laid out a series
of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.

-That is the worst, isn't it?
-Yes.

I'm sorry, Sheldon. l can't help you.

Oh, spoiler alert:
this door's about to slam in your face.

Oh, there you are.
When do I get a key to our apartment?

Um....

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

-Hello?
HOWARD: Hey.

<i>-How'd it go last night with my mom?</i>
-Okay, I guess.

<i>What time did you leave?</i>

[YAWNS]

Actually, I'm still here.

<i>-What? You spent the night?</i>
-Yeah.

After dinner,
we watched a rerun of Rockford Files...

...and then she opened
a bottle of cream sherry...

...and the next thing l know
she was tucking me into your bed.

<i>You wore my pajamas?</i>

Mm-hm.

How do you sleep in these things?
Silk pajamas on satin sheets?

I slid out of the bed like three times.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
Rajesh? You up?

You ready for breakfast?

Oh, boy, breakfast.

<i>Okay, Raj, listen.</i>
<i>You need to get out of there.</i>

But l have a cream sherry hangover
and I smell blintzes.

<i>If you don't leave now, she'll use food and</i>
<i>guilt to keep you there the rest of your life.</i>

Oh, Howard, stop.

<i>Trust me, you're not Jewish,</i>
<i>that's how they get you.</i>

You're being silly.
I can leave whenever I want.

<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Where are your clothes and your shoes?</i>

They're on the chair right over--

<i>Oy vey.</i>

Hello, homewrecker.

What did l do?

You gave Leonard somewhere to go.

Thanks to you, Amy's out
buying his and hers bath towels.

Like l'd ever dry myself with something
that has a possessive pronoun on it.

Okay, listen...

...the truth is
I don't want him living with me.

Great. Kick him out, break his heart,
everybody wins.

No, I don't wanna break his heart,
I love him. This is happening too fast.

You think this is fast?

It is just a matter of time before
I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.

Yeah, and I've seen those legs.
You might wanna get some Drano.

Hold on. lf you don't want to live
with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?

Well, you know how he is.
He's sensitive and emotional.

That's because he drinks
too much soy milk.

I don't know what else
we can do but tell them the truth.

I suppose there's no choice
but to face the crying...

...angry accusations,
and the high-pitched wails of despair.

Yeah. And who knows
how Amy will react.

Here's some more ice.

-Thanks.
-What were we thinking?

We should have just done it
the regular way.

Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque Du Soleil
made it look so easy.

Honestly, if l could bend that far,
what would I need with you?

If you could bend that far,
you'd be doing us both a favor.

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

Hey, Raj, what's up?

<i>You were right. l can't get out of here.</i>

-You're still at my mother's?
<i>-I'm trapped.</i>

<i>My clothes have been in the laundry</i>
<i>all day, and she hid my keys.</i>

<i>I think they might be in her bra</i>
<i>because she jingles when she walks.</i>

<i>What do l do?</i>

Hey, you wanted a woman in your life,
now you got one.

<i>Come on, Howard, help me.</i>

MRS. WOLOWlTZ:
<i>Rajesh, tatellah, l ran you a bath!</i>

<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>she's not gonna bathe me, is she?</i>

Gee, I wish I could tell you no.

All right, well, thanks again
for helping me out.

<i>Howard--</i>

-Should we go back and rescue him?
-Too late. We'll see him at his bar mitzvah.

Here you go.

I picked up the Chinese food
just the way Leonard used to.

-Is it kung pao chicken?
-Yes.

-Brown rice, not white rice?
-Yes.

-Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
-Yes.

-I did good, right?
-Yes.

Amy, are you worried
that us living together...

...will take the mystery
out of our relationship?

-No.
-Yeah, why would you?

Oh, and check this out.

I took the liberty of scripting a new
outgoing voicemail message for both of us.

"Hello, this is Sheldon."

"And this is Amy."

"We're not home right now."

"'Cause we out dropping science, son."

-"Leave a message."
-"Leave a message."

Beep. Heh.

You can't live here.

What? Why? ls it the message?

I only used urban slang to sound tough
so people wouldn't break in.

It's not the message.

Well, what is it then?
I did everything just the way you like it.

-You did.
-Then what the hell, Sheldon?

We have been going out for over two years,
and I've been nothing but patient with you.

I watch your dopey space movies,
I signed your ridiculous contracts.

I stopped wearing lip gloss because
you said it made my mouth look slippery.

I am the best girlfriend
you're ever gonna have.

You give me one good reason
why l can't live here.

It's Penny's fault.

-What?
-She doesn't wanna live with Leonard...

...so he has to come live here again.
She's the snake in our garden.

She's the reason we can't be happy.

-Hey, Ames.
-Yeah, "Hey, Ames" nothing.

I was all set to move in
with Sheldon and l can't because...

-...you don't wanna live with Leonard.
LEONARD: What?

Sheldon, what did you say?

The truth. You don't wanna live
with Leonard and you know it.

-Since when don't you want to live with me?
-You decided to move in...

-...without even asking me if I was ready.
-I think we should talk about that.

Since you love the truth so much...

...why not tell Amy you don't wanna
live with her instead of blaming me?

I thought we were talking about
the other thing.

-You're a coward.
-Well, the evidence does support that.

Come on, Amy. Let's go drink wine and talk
about what jerks our boyfriends are.

You know what would show them?
I should move in here with you.

Um....

So you wanna catch up
<i>on some Walking Dead?</i>

Okay.

Have you seen the one where Lori dies?

No.

Or maybe she doesn't, let's find out.

MRS. WOLOWlTZ: Where are you going?
-No!

[English - US - SDH]

You'll never believe
what happened to me at work.

This old guy was choking on his food
and I saved his life.

Did you Heimlich him?

No, I said,
"l think that old guy's choking."

Then one of the busboys Heimlich'd him.

You're a hero.

Yeah, that was the point of the story.

Do you know
if you have Thursday night off?

Uh, I think so, why?

Why? It's Valentine's Day.

Oh, right.
Yeah, we can do something.

-You could be a little more into it.
-I'm into it, l'm into it.

There's pressure to make the night special
and it never works out.

Well, this time it's gonna be different
because l'm like a romance ninja. Heh.

You don't see it coming and then-- Bam!
Romance! Watch out! Hearts, kisses, love!

Ooh! Ya!

Sometimes I think l've made you
cooler than you used to be...

...then you go
and do that.

So in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt...

...after passing a meal
of spicy chilies is proof...

...that the rectum does possess
the sense of taste.

AMY: l concur, but you changed the subject.
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?

SHELDON:
Oh, you caught that, did you?

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Okay!

Okay.

Everything okay?

Bernie's a little cranky since
she's been working, like, 1 7 hours a day.

I've got a lot on my plate too. l've been
busting my tail playing "Assassin's Creed."

Stuart, you got anything going on
for Valentine's Day?

Not really, other than hiding
all the sharp objects around here...

...and white-knuckling it till morning.

What do you got going on?

I was gonna spend the night
with my special little lady...

...but she got worms
and then I had to take her to the vet.

There must be something
we can do.

Uh, how about, uh,
you keep the store open late...

...and we throw a party for people
who don't have dates?

That actually sounds kind of nice.

The theme will be that the greatest love
a man can have is love he has with himself.

That's good...

...or maybe something
a little less hand-in-the-pants.

Oh. Alex, excellent.

I have a research problem
that I believe you can help with.

Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you.

I've been waiting for an opportunity
to contribute to your scientific work.

Oh, no, that's not gonna happen. No.

What l need you to do is find
a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.

I passed up an opportunity to work at
Fermilab to take this job with you.

Well, I guess those chaps will have to have
someone else buy their girlfriends presents.

Now, here is.... Oh, let's see....
This is....

This is about $2000.

Um, l think she likes monkeys
and the color gray.

Contribute to my work. Heh.

Ah, kids say the darndest things.

-Hey, you coming to lunch?
-Yeah, one second.

-I wanna show you something.
-What?

I was trying to come up with something
really romantic to give Bernadette...

...for Valentine's Day
since she's been such a pain in the ass.

You can't find a card that says that?

Check it out. l used the atomic-force
microscope in the materials-science lab...

...and wrote our initials in a heart one
one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.

Oh, that's cool.

A micro-Valentine for a microbiologist. Heh.

From her micro-husband.

That is amazing.
How long did this take you?

Ah, about 12 hours.
I pulled an all-nighter. Heh.

Oh, wow.

Yeah, l know, it really took a bite
out of my video-game time.

What are you and Penny doing?

I'm gonna take her
to a nice restaurant for dinner.

That's not bad, but as far as romance goes,
I think my gift hits it right out of the--

[GLASS SHATTERS]

-Wanna come to dinner with us?
-Yes, please.

Okay, uh, Amy will be here shortly
expecting the perfect Valentine's gift.

So you're up, kid, dazzle me, go.

Okay, I think l have some great choices.

I went on Amy's Facebook page
and read her interests--

See?
I never would've thought to do that.

Clearly l made a good choice
farming this out to you.

I'm telling you,
Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.

Anyway...

...my socks are on.
Let's knock them off.

Well, um, l know
she loves playing the harp...

...so l found this beautiful music box
that plays one of her favorite songs.

Now, Amy already has a real harp...

...and it can play any song.

What are you trying to pull here?

-No, it's just l thought--
-Next.

Okay, um, l know she's a fan
<i>of The Canterbury Tales...</i>

Mm.

...so l found this cool map that illustrates
the characters' journey through England.

We could put it in a really nice frame.

But she's got Google Maps on her phone.

I don't know how to respond to that.

I hope it's with a third good option
because these first two: Blah.

Okay, well, uh, luckily
I saved the best for last.

Since Amy's a neuroscientist,
I did some research...

...found out that Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal,
the father of modern neuroscience...

...did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.

And I managed to find this signed print.

Wow.

Oh, this is truly remarkable.

-Thank you.
-I think I'll keep it for myself.

-What about your girlfriend?
-Too late, l called dibs.

[PEOPLE CHATTERlNG AND SOFT JAZZ
MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS]

This place is really beautiful.

Wah. Romance ninja.

[PENNY LAUGHS]

PENNY:
Hey.

-Sorry we're late.
-Hey.

No problem. We just sat down.

-Mm. Would you like some wine?
-Fill her up.

I'll tell you when to stop.

Is everything okay?

Terrific. Couldn't be better.

Oh, bite me.

We can still have a nice night.
Just tell me where it is.

If you did what you said
you were gonna do, l'd tell you.

-Uh, where what is?
-She hid my Xbox like l'm a child.

My mom got me that for my birthday,
so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.

I've been working late every night.
All l asked was he clean the apartment...

...and do one load of laundry.
Did he? No.

He kept on playing
that stupid game.

You like pushing buttons so much,
try pushing them on the washing machine.

-I said l'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.

I told you. Turn them inside out.

And I told you to bite me.

Trying to have a magical night here, guys.

-Oh, son of a bitch.
-What?

-Nothing. Nothing.
-No, tell me.

It's just this guy l used to date.

LEONARD:
Oh.

Until he cheated on me with my friend
Gretchen, who's here with him.

-You're kidding.
-And it looks like she lost a lot of weight.

Damn it.

I know it's not ideal,
but don't let them ruin our night.

No, you're totally right.
She could be skinny because she's dying.

That's the spirit.

Screw them. Our night's gonna be
way more special than theirs.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

Uh-oh.

What?

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

-Oh, my God! Yes! Of course I'll marry you!
-Ha, ha.

[CROWD APPLAUDlNG]

Two can play this game. Penny--

-Get up.
-All right.

Nice that the people
who are lonely on Valentine's Day...

...can come here tonight
and be together.

Yeah, l'm really looking forward to it.

In fact, there's no place
I'd rather be than here.

-Except on a date with anybody.
-Literally anybody.

You and l have so much fun hanging out.

If you were a girl,
all of our problems would be solved.

What?

Think about it. We'd hang out,
we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.

It'd be like the best relationship ever.

-It does sound nice.
-Then l'd take you home...

...slip off your little, black dress
and pile-drive you into oblivion.

What?

I can't believe he's gonna marry the girl
he cheated on me with.

Isn't it kind of nice?

He was with the wrong person.
Now he found the right person.

So I'm the wrong person?
Maybe you wanna be with Gretchen too.

They do look happy.

Yeah, maybe tonight.

But a year from now, he'll be crawling
under the sink looking for his Xbox.

Well, he will.

Why don't we just forget about them
and enjoy our Valentine's Day?

Yes, absolutely.

[PENNY CLEARS THROAT]

Heh. Now they're doing that phony,
link-arm-drink thingy.

I totally taught him that.

-I thought we were letting it go.
-We were. lt's just not fair, okay?

They're bad people.

Not supposed to end happy for them,
it's supposed to end happy for me.

Um, it did end happy for you.
You're here with me.

Yeah, yeah, l know.

This is getting hard
to not take personally.

-Come on. Don't make this about you.
-I'm not. lt's about you.

Yeah, whatever.
I told you Valentine's Day sucks.

-This one does, and you're the reason why.
-What?

Compared to them,
I'm feeling pretty good about us.

Me too. How about we blow off dessert,
go home early? l'll do that laundry.

Thank you.

-I love you.
-Love you too.

-So where'd you hide it?
-Where you'd never look.

Damn it, it's in the washing machine.

-Hello.
-Hello.

-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Okay.

-Shall we go to dinner?
-Hang on.

As you know,
I had planned a traditional evening...

...of romance and gifts.

Yes, and as you know,
I planned to pretend to enjoy it.

I've been working
on this facial expression all day.

And I appreciate your effort...

...but upon contemplation,
I decided l was being selfish.

So I canceled our dinner reservations...

...and came up with an even better way
to celebrate Valentine's Day.

-What is that?
-By doing none of it.

No dinner, no romance, no gifts.

We stay here, order a pizza...

...and watch one
of your beloved Star War Trek things.

Really?

That's what you'd love, isn't it?

More than anything.

Well, then, that's what we're gonna do.

Well, I don't know what to say.

This is the most thoughtful gift
that anyone's ever given me.

And that's including an amazing gift
I gave myself earlier today.

I'm your girlfriend, that's my job.

I know gift-giving puts pressure on you
so whatever you got me, you can return.

No.

After everything you didn't do
for me tonight, l want you to have it.

-What's this?
-Read it.

"Sheldon Cooper,
Caltech University employee information"?

At the bottom.

"ln case of emergency,
please contact Amy Farrah Fowler."

And there's my phone number.

This is the most beautiful gift
you could've ever given me.

I thought if l have a stroke
or a kidney stone...

...who would l want to share that with?

And you picked me.

-It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.
-Oh, Sheldon.

Okay, stop ruining Valentine's Day
and order my pizza.

-Night.
-Yep.

[DOOR CLOSES]

You know what?

That was pretty crappy of you.

All l wanted to do
was give you a great night...

...and it's like you went out of your way
to destroy it.

-Yep. l know. I'm a total bitch.
-I'm not saying that.

-Well, I am.
-Fine, you win, you're a bitch.

Why couldn't we just have a nice time?

I don't know.

Maybe because things are going so well
between us lately and I've been happy.

Okay, you're gonna have to make
a lot more sense than that.

Obviously,
I have some commitment issues.

-Glaringly obvious. Go on.
-As long as things keep going great...

...you'll keep asking me to marry you.
Eventually, l'll end up saying yes.

Then we're gonna be married forever
and the whole thing just freaks me out.

Okay.

I know l propose a lot.

So how about this?

I promise l will never ask you
to marry me again.

What do you mean?
Are you breaking up with me?

No. No, no, no.

But if someday, you decide
you wanna get married...

...you have to propose to me.

-Really?
-Yes.

It's all on you.

But when the time comes,
I want the whole nine yards.

I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I wanna be swept off my feet.

Yeah, you got it.

And I'm cool with surprises,
but nothing on a Jumbotron.

I don't wanna cry on a big screen like that.

Okay.

You know what?

This might be the wine talking,
but l have an important question to ask you.

You do?

Leonard Hofstadter?

Yes?

Will you be my Valentine?

Sorry, maybe next year.

I'm just kidding! Romance ninja!
Let's have sex! Wah!

Thank you, guys, for doing this.

We're glad you could make it.

Usually, I spend Valentine's Day sad
and alone. This year, I'm just sad.

[POP MUSlC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

What is it about this holiday
that makes people so unhappy?

I know. I hate myself most of the time,
but tonight's the night l know...

...everyone else does too.

I think you're cool.

Great.

I gotta tell you. We've gotta stop
beating ourselves up like this.

Excuse me, everybody.
Can l have your attention, please?

We're all here tonight
because we have no one to be with.

But that doesn't make us mutants.

The only mutants here
are in these comic books.

We gotta stop defining our self-worth
by whether or not we're in a relationship.

You know what l see when I look around?

I see a room full of great people.

So let's give ourselves a break.
We are a community.

And as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

That was cool, what you said.

-You really think so?
-Yeah, l do.

Thank you.

Uh, would you like to, uh,
get a cup of coffee?

Okay.

Later, losers!

[PHONE RINGlNG]

Hello?

Another medical emergency?
What's wrong with him now?

I seriously doubt he was bitten
by a Chinese bird spider.

How exactly does a bump feel Asian?

Put him on the phone.

Sheldon, l'm not driving over there again.

Because l drove over there yesterday
for a brain tumor...

...that turned out to be
an ice-cream headache.

Yes, l still want to be
your emergency contact.

Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast
and also have a brain tumor.

I'm on my way.

Brain tumor would explain a lot.

RAJESH:
Can l have your attention, please?

We're all here tonight because
we have no one to be with.

We gotta stop defining our self-worth...

...by whether or not we're in a relationship.

We are a community...

...and as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

That was cool. What you said.

Thank you.

Uh, would you like to, uh,
get a cup of coffee?

Okay.

Later, losers!

So then l went to Cambridge,
which was wonderful...

...not only because it's a good school,
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.

That's where l fell in love with astronomy,
and now l'm an astrophysicist at Caltech.

So I guess you could say, uh,
Raj is my name, and stars are my game.

And rhyming is also my game.

So, uh, two games.

Uh, anyway, that's enough about me,
I want to hear everything about you.

I have to go to the bathroom.

I go to the bathroom too.

Sometimes more frequently
than l care to admit.

I've had it checked out, it's nothing.

This is going great.

Mm. Can l have a refill on my chai tea?

Ah, yes, l have a good feeling about this.

I should have bought condoms.

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

<i>Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents:</i>
<i>Fun With Flags.</i>

My apologies
that this episode is coming late.

I did shoot one last week
in honor of Black History Month...

...but l was informed by my roommate
that my spot-on portrayal...

...of George Washington Carver
could be considered "wildly racist."

My heart goes out to the members
of the African-American community...

...who, like me,
have been kept down by the man.

<i>Now, Fun With Flags</i>
is not just for the flag aficionado...

...it's also for the flag novice.

So to help me with that, please welcome
my friend, neighbor and flag virgin...

...not a real virgin.

She's had coitus many times.

Sometimes within earshot
of this flag enthusiast.

Once while he was trying to watch
<i>The lncredibles.</i>

Penny.

Hello.

So, Penny, l understand...

-...you'd like to learn more about flags.
-I can't tell you how many times...

...I've been at a party, everyone's talking
about flags and l just couldn't join in.

Well, you came to the right place.

I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?

What's wrong?

I think it'd look more natural
if you talked to me instead of the camera.

You know, like a real conversation?

It's something we work on
in acting class.

Interesting.

A few people in the Comments section
have said that my delivery is robotic.

Perhaps that isn't the compliment
it sounds like.

Let's try it again. Maybe this time
you could work on body language a bit.

When you're hunched like that,
you're shutting the audience out.

But when you're relaxed and open,
you're inviting them in.

Right.

And which one do I want?

Let's try open.

If our friend the flag has taught me anything,
it's to go where the wind takes you.

As long as you remain
firmly attached to a rigid pole.

And action.

[PENNY CHUCKLES]

So, Penny, what sort of flag questions
keep you awake at night?

Um, well, l'm from Nebraska.

So, what can you tell me
about the state flag?

Gosh, Penny...

...what did you have for breakfast,
a big glass of good question juice?

The Nebraska state flag
is simply the state seal on a field of blue.

Spread your legs, invite them in.

I'm telling you, something's wrong.
I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.

Jeez, how close were you
before we got married?

Don't look under that rock.

[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

-Raj, you okay?
-You in there?

RAJESH:
Go away.

-Come on, buddy, open up.
-We're worried about you.

RAJESH: Oh, just because l stop going to work
and answering my phone...

...you think something bad happened?

Maybe something good happened.

Did something good happen?

Of course not, nothing good ever happens!

Whoa.

-What?
-Just whoa.

Smells pretty ripe in here.

You kind of feel it in your eyes.

Raj, what's going on?

I was humiliated by yet another woman.

You didn't kill her and chop her up,
that's not what we're smelling, right?

No, I took her for coffee...

...and she snuck out the bathroom window
to get away from me.

Oh, you poor baby.

I went and looked.

It was a high and tiny window.

She must've been very motivated.

I'm sorry, that's awful.

-But come on, you gotta shake it off.
-You can't stay in your apartment...

-...for the rest of your life.
-Why not?

With online shopping and overnight
delivery, l can get anything I want.

Look, l just ordered a case
of Dinty Moore beef stew...

...and two live lobsters on Amazon.

-Lobsters overnight?
-You're kidding. Let me see.

Well, I'll be. Look, you can throw in
a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.

Surf and turf sounds good.
See if they have corn on the cob.

Guys, we're trying to get
him out of here, not you in.

You're wasting your time.
Just please, leave me alone.

-Now what?
-I don't know.

We could go to Red Lobster
and talk about it.

We're all thinking it. l just had
the decency to wait for him to leave.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

<i>-Hello, Sheldon.</i>
-Hello.

How's the final stage of your
nicotine addiction study going?

[MONKEY'S GlBBERlNG OVER MONlTOR]

<i>Fine.</i>

<i>Just hold on.</i>
<i>Mommy's on the phone!</i>

<i>Sorry, we've cut the monkeys down</i>
<i>to one cigarette a day...</i>

<i>...so things are a little intense.</i>

<i>Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing</i>
<i>flatworms. Those guys were mellow.</i>

Good news, uh, the latest episode
of Fun With Flags is online.

<i>-Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?</i>
-Much better than l expected.

She even gave me some helpful tips
about acting and body language.

Watch.

Welcome to my world.

Not welcome to my world.

Welcome.
Not welcome.

<i>Subtle but powerful.</i>

I know, I'm still learning to control it.

<i>Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?</i>

Why would l do that?

<i>Because she's your friend</i>
<i>and she did a nice job.</i>

<i>I'm sure she'd like to hear it.</i>

All right.

<i>l didn't mean now. Hello?</i>

[MONKEY'S GlBBERlNG OVER MONlTOR]

<i>Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette.</i>
<i>Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.</i>

Oh. Hey, what's up?

Um....

You need me to shut the door
so you can do your knocking thing?

No. I didn't start yet. It's fine.

Okay. So, what do you need?

Well, I was thinking about
you helping me out last night.

Penny.

And I just wanted to tell you, Penny...

...that the answer to the question,
"Who did a great job?" is you.

Penny.

-Really?
-Yes.

You were very natural
in front of the camera...

...and I found your suggestions
extremely helpful.

Oh, sweetie, you just made my day.

Okay.

My acting class is putting on a play Friday.
I can put you and Amy on the guest list.

Oh, that sounds terrible.
Why would l want to do that?

<i>That's right,</i>
<i>they're no good without the lighter.</i>

So much for your advice
on complimenting Penny.

<i>Why, what happened?</i>

She tried to rope us into going to her
acting class to see a play.

Don't worry, luckily I had the good sense
to drown that kitten in the river.

<i>Sheldon, that's very rude.</i>
<i>She helped you with your show.</i>

<i>The right thing to do is reciprocate</i>
<i>by going to see her play.</i>

Oh, so many crazy rules.

[MONKEY'S GlBBERlNG OVER MONlTOR]

<i>That better be Tootsie Rolls</i>
<i>you're throwing at me!</i>

Penny.

Penny.

Penny.
Oh, yeah, much better.

What?

Amy pointed out to me that
since you did something nice for me...

...I'm obligated to do something
nice for you.

So, yes, l'll go to your dopey play.

-Hey, I don't want you to go anymore.
-Why not?

Go because you want to,
not because you have to.

Oh, dear Lord, more rules.
Where does it stop?

Can l want to go
because l have to want to go?

-Okay, do whatever you want.
-Yeah, but, no, wait.

Do whatever l want
or whatever l have to want?

Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.

All right.

I don't want to
but at least that makes sense.

You know, I haven't seen Raj
in several days.

Is he no longer a part of our social group?

And if so, should we be
interviewing for a replacement?

Perhaps this time we go Latin.

He's just decided
he's never leaving his apartment again.

Oh. Brilliant.
I've been itching to pull that trigger.

He's upset because
he can't get anywhere with women.

Would it help if l gave him some pointers?

I'm just funning you. Ha, ha.

Hi. I don't know if you remember me
but l was here the other night at your party.

Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.

LUCY: Yeah.
-You're the one?

Let me tell you something.

That guy you blew off
happens to be my best friend.

Okay? He was devastated.

Sorry.

Can you just give him this?

Okay.

But l gotta warn you,
Raj is a proud, passionate man.

If you go running out on him again...

...you're only gonna get like three or four
more chances before you are history.

Come on, she came back.
This is good news. You should celebrate.

I don't want to celebrate.

Not even a little?

We could have a pants party.
Go put some on.

Why would l want her number?
I want nothing to do with this woman.

-Come on, Raj.
-You don't get it.

I want nothing to do with any woman.

My heart is stone.

From now on, l am a monk.

I renounce all worldly pleasures.

Except for lobster.

And garlic butter.

Boy, l wanna tell you it's her loss,
but you are not making it easy.

You're a good friend for trying to help,
but l've made my choice.

All right, well...

...I'll see you around.

See you.

No, wait.

Take her number.
I don't want the temptation.

Okay.

I must be strong so l don't stray from
my true purpose: the study of the universe.

All right.

Thanks for ruining lobster for me.

RAJESH:
Wait! Give me the number!

Give me the number! Give me the number!

So, Amy, what's going on
with your addiction study?

Sadly l'm no longer associated
with that project.

-Why? What happened?
-Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

You can get animals addicted to a harmful
substance, you can dissect their brains...

...but you throw their own feces back at them
and suddenly you're unprofessional.

I'm sorry.

That I asked.

All right, let's get this stupid play over with.

Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.

-Why?
-You know why. The Nintendo DS.

[GROANS]

And the PSP.

[GROANS]

Now the Game Boy.

Oh, for Pete's sake.

-Can we go now?
-Is that all of it?

Just set it down.

Just so you know,
this is not a stupid play.

<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>
is an American classic.

It's about streetcars?

Great. Then l won't need this.

Just a sec.

Oh, who says "just a sec"?
I hate myself.

Hello.

-Hi.
-Uh, would you like to come in?

Uh, no, l can't stay.

Oh.

I just wanted to say...

...I'm sorry for running out
of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool.

So yeah.

I'm sorry.

Wait.

Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

It's okay, l can take anything.

Unless it's something I did, or said, or am,
because those are like my buttons.

No, it's not any of that.

It's just, l kind of have a hard time
around people l don't know.

Really? Then what were you doing
at the comic book store that night?

I've been trying to force myself
into situations l'm not comfortable with.

I saw the flyer in the store window
and I made myself go in.

I don't even like comic books.

-Yeah, me neither.
-What were you doing there?

I lied. l love them.

I only said that so you'd go out with me.

You don't want to do that.

I'm kind of broken.

That's great. l'm broken too.

-No, you're not.
-I totally am.

If it wasn't for this beer, l couldn't even
talk to you right now. l'm a wreck.

There are many things
seriously wrong with me.

And not quirks either...

...like, diagnosable psychological problems.

Maybe brain damage.

Well, how do l know
you're not just saying that?

Go out with me on one date
and I promise you you'll see.

Okay.

Text me.
Bye.

You won't regret it.
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.

And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.

You love her very much, don't you?

Yes.

PENNY:
I think you have great capacity for devotion.

You will be lonely
when she passes on, won't you?

I understand what that is.

MAN: To be lonely?
-She's pretty good, huh?

She is.

But when do they get to the part
about streetcars?

When I was a very young girl.

When I was 1 6 years old,
I made the discovery:

Love.

All at once and much, much too completely.

It was like you turned
a blinding light on something...

...that had always been half a shadow.

That's how it struck the world for me.

But l was unlucky.

Deluded.

-She's remarkable.
-She really is.

Our Penny's a star.

How can she remember all those lines...

...but as a waitress, she can't remember
no tomato on my hamburger?

[English - US - SDH]

I know you guys don't want to do this,
but we have no choice.

You can either bitch and whine
or we can get it over with.

-I got whine.
-I got the B-word.

Yeah, well, it's in our contract
to serve on a university committee.

And frankly,
this is one I believe in, okay? Here:

Encouraging more women
to pursue a career in the sciences.

Come on, if l was good
at convincing women to do stuff...

...I wouldn't have spent
so much of my 20's in the shower. Heh.

If you ask me,
this whole thing is a waste of our time.

-Helping women?
-Yeah, helping anyone.

People should take care of themselves.

Oh, like yesterday when you
made me drive you to the dry cleaners...

...the pharmacy and the post office?

I'm not saying people can't use tools.

Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

You don't think it's worthwhile to get
more women in science?

I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

I believe in a gender-blind society
like in Star Trek...

...where women and men of all races
and creeds work side by side as equals.

You mean where they were advanced
enough to invent an interstellar warp drive...

...but a black lady
still answered the space phone?

Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

Howard's disturbing recollections aside...

...I don't appreciate being forced
to do banal committee work.

I know. You're too smart for this.

Exactly. lt's like asking the Human Torch
to heat up your frozen burrito.

Got it. All right, l'm thinking one way
to counter bias in the peer-review process...

...is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names...

...like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.

I suppose there is a history
of professional women...

...using their initials
so as not to be pre-judged.

Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,
uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.

Van Nuys pole-dancer, D.D. Melons.

All right. I think we've really helped
women today. Let's fire up the Xbox.

Don't make this a school project
where l'm the smart kid doing the work...

...while the slackers sit and watch.

We're not. You're the smart kid
doing all the work...

...while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

So you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

No, you're a tool I was using
to make my point.

Guys, our topic is
"Encouraging Women in Science."

Can you at least play a less sexist game?

How is it sexist?

My character wields a battle ax
as well as any man.

Not to mention she has mammary glands
that could nurse a family of 30.

And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin-Robbins.

Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner...

...I hear glass ceilings shattering
all over town.

Sheldon, you're always saying
how much smarter you are than me.

Spend five seconds and come up with one
idea on how to get more women into science.

All your ideas address the issue
at a university level. By then it's too late.

You need to design a program that
targets girls at the middle-school level...

...and sets them on an academic track
towards the hard sciences.

That's actually good.
Why didn't I think of that?

Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

I wonder if there's a way
we could give the idea a trial run.

I could call my old middle school, see if
we can talk to some of the female students.

Great. Try to set up something
for us to go over there.

Hold on. While I'm comfortable
speaking about science...

...I'm not sure l know how to spark the
interest of school children. Better Google it.

What exactly are you looking up?

"How do I get 1 2-year-old girls excited?"

-No!
-No!

Thanks again for letting me crash
girl's night.

Are you kidding?
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

I've slept with guys for less.

It's a joke.

Based on real events.

Anyway, I was hoping
I could, uh, pick your brains a little.

I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday
and I need a killer first date.

Evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted to a man...

...who is steady in the face of danger,
so I recommend an unsafe environment.

A seedy bar
on the wrong side of the tracks...

...a picnic near a lunatic asylum...

...a wine-tasting on skid row.

Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues,
we could start with something simpler.

Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

You go on Space Mountain,
you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

That ride is shorter than you think...

...and they take a picture of you at the end,
so make sure you got your clothes on.

It's a joke.

Based on real events.

Disneyland? I don't know.

With all the crowds
and the weird characters walking around...

...just reminds me too much of India.

I haven't been since I was a kid.
We should go one weekend.

Weekends are too crowded.

-So blow off work, go on a weekday.
-Hooky?

I've never played hooky in my life.

My mom said that's how girls end up
addicted to reefer and jazz music.

More like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel...

...with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

-Joke?
-I can laugh about it now.

What do you say? This Friday
we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

-I'm in.
-Me too.

Excuse me, l thought we were
trying to solve my problem.

Oh, yeah, right.

Wait, what was your problem again?

I'm a man who can't talk to women, trying
to figure out how to go on a romantic date...

...with a girl who suffers from social
anxiety, she can't be around other people.

Yeah, that's a toughie.

Let's think.

Are we doing just Disney
or California Adventure too?

It's nice of your old school to let us try out
our science talk on some female students.

They were actually pretty excited.
I'm their most famous alum.

If you don't count the serial killer
who ate all those prostitutes.

This must feel good for you, coming
back to your alma mater as an astronaut.

Yeah. Last time I was here
I was just a scrawny little nerd.

And now you're also an astronaut.

So many memories.
How many times in these hallways...

...was I tripped, punched and spit on? Heh.

Oh, look, here's my old locker.

I have a masters in engineering...

...I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski
got me and my briefcase to fit in there.

-Hey.
-What?

Nothing.

Smart, we don't want any problems.

I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

What did you tell your boss?

Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.

At 7 last night I called
about a problem at the lab...

...and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

At 9:30, l called and told him
that one of my scallops tasted weird.

At 1 1 :30, I called and said
I was throwing up like a fire hose.

At 12:45, I called and made nothing
but dry-heaving sounds.

And now l'm going to Disneyland!

Penny, what did you say?

I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
I said, "Bye."

So, what are we gonna do first?

I don't know about you, but l'm going to the
place that gives you a princess makeover.

Ooh, that sounds like fun.

You're kidding, right? We're not just
gonna get drunk and go on rides?

Come on, do it with us.

Ah, all right, whatever. How does it work?

Okay, so you pick your princess,
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella.

They give you hair, makeup, the works.

I guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

-I want to be Cinderella too.
-Yeah.

We can't all be Cinderella.

Then how do we decide?

Well, it's simple. This was my idea,
I'm driving, I'm Cinderella.

You bitches got a problem with that,
we can stop the car right now.

Excuse me.

I'm meeting a girl here.
It's kind of a first date.

In a library?

She and l are both a little awkward in social
situations so this seemed like a good idea.

Ah. People say I'm a little awkward too.

May I join you?

No, you can't join us.

Go climb back up whatever beanstalk
you came down from.

You can do better.

Oh, we're eating here?

We're having a texting date?

LUCY:
<i>I love that.</i>

<i>RAJESH: As you're reading, it will help</i>
<i>to remember l have an adorable accent.</i>

Okay, who's ready for some science?

Me too.

Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

I'm here with my friends, Dr. Cooper,
and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

And we are going to show you girls
how cool a job in science can be.

How cool, you ask?

Well, how about negative 273 degrees...

...because that's the temperature at which
entropy reaches its minimum value.

Did l just learn something new
and have fun doing it? What?

All right.

So now let's bring out theoretical physicist,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper!

Hello, female children.

Allow me to inspire you...

...with a story about
a great female scientist.

Polish-born, French-educated...

...Madame Curie.

Co-discoverer of radioactivity...

...she was a hero of science.
Until her hair fell out...

...her vomit and stool
became filled with blood...

...and she was poisoned to death
by her own discovery.

With a little hard work...

...I see no reason
why that can't happen to any of you.

Are we done? Can we go?

The thing to remember is
you can go to outer space too.

Heh. I mean, look at me.

I went to this very school.
Those desks you're sitting in?

I was once superglued to one of them.

HOWARD:
Mm-hm.

Did you go to the moon?

No, but l did go
to the International Space Station.

Did you fly the rocket?

No, but l was in the rocket.

-I didn't actually--
-So you just flew around?

That's kind of like my uncle.
A flight attendant.

No, heh, l'm an American hero,
your uncle brings people nuts, okay?

All right, all right, all right.

Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh?
Thank you, Astronaut Howard.

[CLEARS THROAT]

Um, l am what's called
an experimental physicist.

Which is super fun because l get
to test theories and work with lasers.

-Yes?
-How did you decide to become a scientist?

Oh, excellent question.

Um, l suppose l've always been into science.

My mother and father are scientists,
so I was kind of led in that direction.

Pushed might be a better way to describe it.

To be honest with you guys, when
I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star.

Like Snoop Dogg, but with
a healthy respect for the police.

[ALL LAUGHING]

Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

Just like my mother did.

[RAPPING]
<i>After I confided, I was derided and chided</i>

<i>My moms and l collided</i>

<i>She said my dreams were misguided</i>

[CLEARS THROAT]

That's just a little freestyle.

<i>RAJESH: My dad's a gynecologist in India. So if</i>
<i>you're ever over there and need a checkup...</i>

<i>...as he likes to say, he's "at your cervix."</i>

<i>LUCY: That's terrible. Your dad</i>
<i>should be sent to the pun-itentiary.</i>

RAJESH:
<i>That's a fitting pun-ishment.</i>

<i>I still don't know what you do for a living.</i>

LUCY:
<i>Web design.</i>

RAJESH:
<i>Anything l might've seen?</i>

<i>LUCY: l don't know.</i>
<i>You ever look at porn websites?</i>

RAJESH:
<i>No. Never. What is porn?</i>

LUCY:
<i>Sorry, auto-correct.</i>

<i>That was supposed to say "prom websites."</i>

RAJESH:
<i>Ooh, fun. l love prom.</i>

<i>The romance, the gowns,</i>
<i>it's like a fairy tale come to life.</i>

<i>Sorry, auto-correct.</i>

<i>That was supposed to say "l like sports."</i>

I never wanted to play the cello.

How do you meet girls playing the cello?

"Hey, wanna come over to my house
and hear me play an instrument...

...that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"

Quick, pull the fire alarm,
let's get out of here.

Uh, hello again. Um....

Yeah, l don't know if women in general...

...have been actively discouraged
from pursuing the sciences...

...but it's clear you young women
here today have been.

While l was listening to my colleagues
waste your time...

...it occurred to me that it might be
much more meaningful...

...to hear about women in science
from actual women in science.

And, uh, l happen to know
two brilliant examples...

...who have agreed to speak to you
on the phone right now.

Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler?
Are you there?

AMY [OVER PHONE]:
<i>We're here.</i>

Thank you for taking time out of your busy
schedule to enlighten these young women.

It's our pleasure.

I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.

And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski-Wolowitz,
and I'm a microbiologist.

The world of science needs more women,
but from a young age...

...we girls are encouraged to care
more about the way we look...

...than about the power of our minds.

That's true. Every one of you has
the capacity to be anything you want to be.

Unless you wanna be Cinderella.

Come at me, see what happens.

RAJESH:
<i>This was really fun.</i>

My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk.

Thanks for today.

I've been trying to do more things
that scare me.

And coming here
was definitely one of them.

But it was also really nice.

So thanks, and, um, l'm gonna go.

Maybe I could do one more scary thing
before I go and give you a kiss goodbye?

You know, if that's okay.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Panic attack! Maybe next time.

I'm counting that as foreplay.

Bernie, I'm home.

You have fun today?

BERNADETTE:
Yes. And l have a surprise for you.

Please be Cinderella, please be Cinderella.

Well, hello, Prince Charming.

Milady.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hey, how was your--? What?

I can explain. I played hooky with the girls
and we all went to Disneyland and go--

-What are you doing?
-Disneyland, go on, I'm listening.

Sheldon.

All Snow White needs
is one little kiss to wake up.

Heard you the first time.

[English - US - SDH]

What you doing?

You said clean up. l'm cleaning up, heh.

You can't just throw everything
in the closet.

You can tell me what to do
or you can tell me how to do it...

...but you can't do both.
This isn't sex.

Well, what if someone looks in there?

They're coming over for dinner,
no one will look in the closet.

You don't know that. What if someone's
looking for the bathroom?

It could work out.

For all we know,
there's a toilet in there somewhere.

Fine. After tonight,
we need to get a handle on this mess.

We should show the closet to Sheldon.

Why?

Ha. Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing.

Everything in his apartment
has a label on it...

...including his label maker,
which has a label that says "label maker."

If you look really close at that label-maker
label, you'll see a label that says "label."

No, he's our guest. We can't ask him
to straighten our closet.

No, we wouldn't ask him.

We'd just show him the closet and
let the goblins in his head take it from there.

HOWARD:
Hey, guys, come on in.

AMY: Hi.
-Ooh, it smells good.

Thanks. Sheldon, I know tonight's
the night you eat Thai food.

I went to the Asian market,
got the ingredients, made it from scratch.

Oh, you shouldn't have.

It was my pleasure.

No, you really shouldn't have.

I brought my own.

You stopped and got him takeout?

I had no choice.
He kept kicking the back of my seat.

Sheldon, l've been cooking all day.

Well, now don't you feel silly?

Show him the closet.

These spring rolls are amazing.
Good job, Bernadette.

That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as
good if I hadn't tried your food first.

Howard, did you want your clothes
arranged seasonally or by color?

-Color's fine.
-Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

Aren't you gonna spend
a little time with Amy?

Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

The other day at Whole Foods, he spent
an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.

And some thanks l got.

The assistant manager chased me out
with an artisanal salami.

His quirks just make you love him more.

Someone please agree with me.

Come on. It's getting late. Time to go.

Oh! Five more minutes.

That's what you said five minutes ago.

Amy and Penny are already in the car,
move it.

How come l never get to do
anything l wanna do?

If he really wants to stay and finish,
I can give him a ride home.

Please, Leonard. He said it's okay.

Sheldon, it's--
Wait, l can go home without you? Bye.

Howard, l have a few questions.

I found three bowling pins.

Now, do you juggle these
or are you missing seven?

-Juggle.
-You health nuts kill me.

Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

And look,
you found the juggling pins I hid.

Now, a couple more items.

Howard, l found this letter
from your dad in a box.

-Based on content, it could either be filed--
-Wait, you opened this?

I had to find out if it's
personal correspondence or memorabilia.

-Based on the content--
-I couldn't be less interested.

Now, come on, I'll take you home.

-Don't you want to know what's in it?
-If I did, I would've opened it years ago.

The closet looks great.
Let's get out of here.

Can l bring this box of extra shirt buttons
to sort on the ride?

-Do whatever you want.
-Thanks.

Oh!

Great party.

When I first met Howard, he'd pull
his scrotum out of his shorts and say:

"Oh! l sat in gum."

What is your point?

It's kind of weird how grown up he is now.
Happily married, throwing dinner parties.

Really? You couldn't just say that?
You had to tell the scrotum story?

LEONARD:
Trying to paint a picture.

It was a nice change of pace,
not eating takeout around a coffee table.

We could throw a dinner party too.
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

Sure. Just, when you say "dressed up,"
you mean nice clothes, right?

Not like capes and tights and crap.

Yeah.

-Although--
-No.

-Howie, you okay?
-Yeah, l just couldn't sleep.

I told you you shouldn't
have espresso after dinner.

I know the little cups make you
feel big, but it's not worth it.

It's this stupid letter.

-Did you read it?
-No.

-You must be curious.
-Of course I'm curious.

I haven't seen the man
since l was a little kid.

And a letter shows up
on my 1 8th birthday.

What's that about?

Then why don't you read it?

Maybe he apologizes
or explains why he left.

He abandoned me and my mother.

Why does he deserve a chance
to explain anything?

I get that.

So, what do you wanna do with it?

Something l should've done
a long time ago.

Really? Are you sure?

Yep.

Feel better?

I do.

[SMOKE ALARM BEEPING]

Great.

Neither one of us
is tall enough to reach that.

I can't believe he set it on fire.

Yeah, just seeing that letter
really freaked him out.

And he was already having a tough day.
He accidentally wore my pants to work.

I don't know why he was upset.
They were bigger on him than me.

I'm really curious what's in that letter.

Me too, but l guess now we'll never know.

You said Sheldon read it.
Why not ask him?

I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be
if l didn't respect my husband's privacy?

What if I ask
and you happen to be in the room?

-That works.
-Okay.

[SlGHS]

Blech!

It's like cleaning out
the entire building's belly button.

-Hey, Sheldon.
SHELDON: Oh, hello.

What can l do for you ladies?

-You have something we want.
-Oh, dear.

My mother warned me this is what happens
to pretty boys in the big city.

No, we just want information.

Oh. Oh, I've got that in spades. Ravage me.

We heard you read the letter
from Howard's father.

-I did.
-What did it say?

I can't tell you that.

I'm bound by closet organizer-organizee
confidentiality.

Sheldon, that's not a real thing.

Neither is the rule that you have to hold
your girlfriend's hand at the movies.

But that doesn't stop you
from pawing at me...

...like you're a bear
and I'm a trash can full of sweets.

Why do you even care?
Just tell us what it says.

Control over the information
contained in that letter belongs to Howard.

By happenstance, l came to know it.

That doesn't give me the right
to disseminate it freely.

The letter was found in Bernadette's closet.
Doesn't that count for something?

Are you pointing out that California
is a community-property state...

...and since Howard and Bernadette are
married, intellectual property in the letter...

...is jointly owned by the two spouses?

Yeah, obviously.

Well played.

Sometimes I don't give you
enough credit, Penny.

Dude, you made the right choice
coming to me for help with this party.

Actually, all l did was invite you.

Well, put your mind at ease.

I'm here to make sure your dinner party
kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.

Now, the first thing we need is a theme.

I'm thinking, ah,
turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.

I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.

Penny and l just wanna
do something low-key.

You know, cocktails, light jazz music,
hors d'oeuvres.

So your theme is "I saw a rerun of Mad Men
and bought crab puffs from Trader Joe's"?

I'd hate to miss that. Ahem.

Hey, where have you been?

Oh, Leonard.

If I was prone to sarcasm...

...I'd say I was pulling off a major heist
at the Museum of Laundry Baskets.

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 1 0.

I meant, golly, Sheldon,
you've been gone a long time.

Oh, well, l was waylaid
by Penny, Bernadette and Amy.

They made me reveal confidential
information about Howard's father.

-What information?
-I can't tell you that.

I'm bound by closet organizer-organizee
confidentiality.

Come on, we won't tell anyone.

Sorry, badgering me won't work.
What you should have said is:

"lt's pointless to keep this a secret.
Penny will tell."

-Fine, then that.
-All right, I'll tell you.

My goodness,
everyone's on their game today.

This is really fun.

Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up
once in a while.

And the hors d'oeuvres are delightful.

-As is the company.
<i>-Aw.</i>

My shirt is itchy, and I wish l were dead.

[UPBEAT JAZZ MUSlC
PLAYlNG ON STEREO]

Hey, everybody, before Howard gets here,
let's all just agree...

-...to not bring up the letter.
-Of course.

PENNY: Sure.
AMY: Absolutely.

If I say yes, can we turn off
that Latin orgy music?

It's ridiculous that we still have to
walk up all these flights of stairs.

-Yeah, try doing it in heels.
-I am.

Wait. There's something
I have to tell you.

-What?
-I know what was in your dad's letter.

Sheldon, l swear to God
I'm gonna kill you!

Hey!

I made him tell us.

"Us"? Who else knows?

-I know.
-Me too.

Same here.

Shame on all of you.

You know too.

Couldn't leave him with one friend,
could you?

So everybody knows what's in that letter
except for me?

Yes, it's six against one.
Stand down, sir.

How could you do this?

I'm sorry.

-If you want, we could tell you.
-I don't want to know.

I mean....

I do, but....

I gotta go.

Used me as a human shield?

I panicked.

He looked taller than usual.

BERNADETTE:
Howard?

In here.

Sorry.

I should've left it alone.

It's okay. l'm sorry l ran off like that.

What are you looking at?

Pictures of my dad and me
when l was a kid.

-That's nice.
-I gotta tell you...

...as angry as l am at Sheldon for blabbing...

...he did a hell of a job
organizing this closet.

Look at this.

"Photos of Wolowitz Family
Before Father Left Forever."

Look. Check out 9-year-old Howie
with cornrows.

Neither race was happy
to see me with those.

Think you can take a break?

-Why?
-Got a little surprise for you.

Come on.

Oh, honey...

...I am in no mood to have sex tonight.

I mean, I'll lay there
if you absolutely have to have it, but--

Oh.

What are you guys doing here?

You weren't sure whether you wanted
to know what was in your dad's letter...

...so we came up with
kind of a cool solution.

Oh, yeah? What's that?

It's simple, really.

It occurred to me that
knowing and not knowing...

...can be achieved by creating a macroscopic
example of quantum superposition...

...the principle that a physical system exists
partially in all its possible states at once.

We were all thinking it, really.

It was kind of the elephant
in the room, so....

Anyway, um, l realized
if we each present you...

...with an account of
what your father wrote to you...

...only one of which is true,
and we don't tell you which one it is...

...you will forever be
in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

Yeah, and I said if it wasn't epistemic,
we might as well not do it.

Sit down, honey.

-Raj, you're up.
-Okay, um, ahem.

It was a card for your 1 8th birthday.

Inside it said, "Happy birthday, Howard.
I love you. Dad."

Oh, and it was a "Far Side" card...

...the one where the frog has its tongue
stuck to the underside of an airplane.

Thinks it's a fly.

Silly frog. So funny.

Sheldon?

[CLEARS THROAT]

It was a map...

...leading to the lost treasure
of famous pirate "One-Eyed Willy."

Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.

-Told you.
-Don't.

Amy?

You didn't know it...

...but your father was in the auditorium
at your high school graduation...

...and he cried
because he was so proud of you.

Really?

Or that's complete poppycock which Amy
made up. It still could be the map.

Penny?

It was a letter explaining that your dad
wasn't who he said he was.

Eventually his other life caught up to him...

...and the only way to keep
you and your mom safe was to leave.

I would like to change mine.

The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.

Now it's completely different from Goonies.

-No, it's not.
-Don't.

Okay, my turn.

Your dad wrote about how family
is the most important thing...

...and that you should never
throw it away like he did.

Hmm.

Bernadette?

In the envelope was a picture of your dad
holding you the day you were born.

On the back he wrote,
"Howard, my son, my greatest gift."

You okay?

Yeah.

I'm terrific.

So...?

Which one do you think it is...

...matey?

Actually, I don't wanna know.

I want all of them to be true.

Well, one of them is.

That's pretty cool.

Thank you, guys.

Hey, it's still early.
Why don't we go back and have that party?

-Yeah.
-Okay.

Yeah, surprisingly...

...the letter from your father wasn't
the most interesting thing in the closet.

Bernadette's diary
has some saucy passages.

-Sheldon, don't you dare.
-Nothing to worry about.

Your secret's safe with me.

That's more like it.

Although copyright law would allow me
to quote snippets in the context of a review.

[UPBEAT JAZZ MUSlC
PLAYlNG ON STEREO]

I'm glad you're feeling better.

Me too.

But if I'd known we were gonna be dancing,
I would've wore my flats.

-Well, this turned out pretty well, huh?
-Yeah, l think so.

I agree. That is, if you've never
been to or heard of a party before.

If you'd let me pierce your brain
with a hot needle in the right place...

...you'd be happy all the time.

Penny, l have a couple of questions
about your closet.

Is there any reason
you're keeping this dead goldfish?

Damn, I forgot to feed him.

And that l had him.

Well, now, did you also have a dog?

Because l found what appears to be
a battery-operated chew toy--

Party's over! Party's over!

[English - US - SDH]

I was reading about this jellyfish
that never dies.

Instead it reverts to its asexual state
and then grows up again.

We thought my 90-year-old grandfather
had reverted to an asexual state...

...but the lawsuit from his Jamaican
caregiver proved us all wrong.

My point is, immortality is not only
a possibility, it is real.

Only if you're this jellyfish,
which periodically...

...reverts to a mass
of undifferentiated protoplasm.

If I could keep my Gmail account,
I'd be okay with that.

-[lN RHOTAClSTIC VOICE] Hello, fellas.
LEONARD: Hey, buddy.

-How are you?
-Remember we were trying to figure out...

...what that smell coming from
Professor Tupperman's office was?

HOWARD: Yeah.
-Turns out it was Tupperman.

Dead at his desk for two weeks.

HOWARD: Terrible.
-Oh, my God.

In lieu of flowers,
the department chair is asking...

...that everyone donate a bottle
of Febreze.

If we're going to change the topic
from jellyfish...

...I'd be okay with brine shrimp
or the history of the unicycle.

Show a little compassion. The man died.

And turned into a puddle of goo.

Now, we can either sit around
and cry over spilt professor...

...or we can rejoice in the knowledge
that a tenured position has just opened up.

I choose to do the latter.

Excuse me,
the whole tenure system is ridiculous.

A guaranteed job for life only encourages
the faculty to become complacent.

If we really want science to advance...

...people should have chips
implanted in their skulls...

...that explode
when they say something stupid.

Well, I believe people do their best work
when they feel safe and secure.

[MlMlCS CHlP EXPLODING]

If you need my nose,
you'll find it firmly lodged...

...up the rectum of the tenure committee.

You PhDs gonna go suck up like Kripke?

No. I mean, I'll apply,
but l'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.

Yeah, me neither.
It should be about the work.

And if l can't get tenure,
I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.

Raj, don't dangle false hope
in front of Leonard like that.

Excuse me, but I think l'm just as qualified
as you are.

[MlMlCS CHlPS EXPLODING]

-So "tenured" means a job for life?
-Yep.

And you can't get fired...

-...even if you're bad at it?
-Mm, not really.

Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty
waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.

[CHUCKLES]

While l disagree
with the premise of tenure...

...if they gave it to me,
it wouldn't diminish my output.

I'm like the sun. I can't turn this off.

-Are Rajesh and Leonard competing as well?
-Mm-hm.

Do they know they don't stand a chance
because you're so great?

Well put.

I must say, I go back and forth
on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing...

...but those moments when you worship me
really keep you in the running.

It would be nice to have the income,
stop taking money from my parents.

Money from family does come
with strings attached.

You have no idea.

They buy me a new BMW for my birthday,
but can l get seat warmers? No.

"lf you want a warm butt,
pay for it yourself."

Well, maybe I will, old man.

I think that's enough wine for now.

I just keep thinking how cool it would be
if l called my mom...

-...and told her that I got tenure at CalTech.
-She'd be proud, huh?

Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call. Heh.

My primary concern
with being granted tenure...

...is living with an insanely jealous
roommate after the fact.

I might need to sleep with a gun
under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.

Or you take advantage of your newfound
economic stability and move out...

...buy a house, get married, start a family.

Or the chainsaw.

And I will return to New Delhi in triumph
atop a bejeweled white elephant.

And you know what will be on
that elephant's back? A seat warmer.

"No, Father, you may not have a ride!"

I'm gonna make some coffee.

So who do you schmooze
to get this deal?

I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.
I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.

-That's great. That shows a lot of integrity.
-Thank you.

I'm a naive idiot, right?

Oh, good, you heard me.

If you really want tenure,
cozy up to the people making the decision.

Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.

You don't say.

But l suppose it wouldn't hurt
to know who's on the committee.

Let's see. Janine Davis. Oh, dear.

-Is that a problem?
-Well....

Even you. You're a slave.

I'm a what?

Not sure, it could go either way.

-Hey, Mrs. Davis.
-Hey.

Dr. Hofstadter.

Just thought I'd come down and
start getting ready for swimsuit season.

Good for you.

Not that you need it.
I bet you look great in a swimsuit.

Thank you.

I've got what my father
used to call furniture disease.

My chest is falling into my drawers. Ha, ha.

I'm not, uh, familiar with this model.
How do l make it start?

You push "start."

Right. Heh.

[BEEPS]

This one might be broken.

You have to move.

Got it. Heh.

Oh. Heh, heh.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, now l'm feeling it.

Oh, this is great.

[PANTlNG]
I could do this for the rest of my life.

Hey, speaking of things you do
for the rest of your life...

...uh, did I read that you're
on that tenure committee?

Yep.

I gotta get a home gym.

I'm sure you have a lot
of good applicants.

I just wanted to say hi...

...and let you know
that I'll be throwing my hat in the...

[PUFFER HlSSES]



-All right, I'll keep an eye out for that.
-Yeah.

Hey, Hofstadter.

Funny seeing you here
for the first time in ever.

Go away.

-Janine the machine, let's do this.
-Hey, Barry.

Oh, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.

I guess you got here early to burn off
that banana bread l baked you.

-Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.
-No, my pleasure.

If you like banana bread,
I've got a great recipe.

The trick is in fresh ground....

I'll e-mail it to you.

All right, I'm warm.
Ready to kick it up a notch?

Let's go.

[MACHlNES BEEP]

That's enough cardio for me, guys.

Gonna stretch out
before I hit the weights.

You okay?

Call someone.

[BEEPS]

<i>Good day, Mrs. Davis.</i>

<i>This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali</i>
<i>from the Astrophysics Department.</i>

<i>Don't be alarmed, l'm not really in space.</i>

[RAJESH SNORTS]

<i>Anywho, l'd like to take this opportunity</i>
<i>to tell you about myself.</i>

<i>So sit back, relax,</i>
<i>and enjoy the following 90-minute video.</i>

Oh, come on.

RAJESH [ON COMPUTER]: Born in New Delhi,
<i>the third son of an itinerant gynecologist...</i>

<i>...l showed early signs of genius.</i>

<i>At the age of 5,</i>
<i>I discovered a celestial object...</i>

<i>...which later turned out to be the moon.</i>

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis.

Oh, God, they're everywhere.

Come in.

-Dr. Cooper, how can l help you?
-Yes, hello. I'm fine.

I understand you may have a bad
impression of me, so l bought you a gift.

-Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.
-It's too late.

Get ready to like me.

<i>Roots?</i>

The tragic history of slavery in America.
Fun for the whole family.

Why would you think
this is an appropriate gift?

Um....

Well....

You are black, right?

This meeting has come to an end.

Because you wanna start watching it
right now. Copy that.

Let's see.

Up next on the tenure committee is....

Professor Woo.

Get ready for the complete works
of Jackie Chan.

Gentlemen.

-Where have you been?
-Nurse's office.

-Asthma attack?
-Asthma, heart. Some kind of attack.

I'm fine, though.

You guys going to
Professor Tupperman's memorial?

-Probably not.
-Barely knew him.

Yeah, you wouldn't wanna look like you guys
are brownnosing the tenure committee...

...who will all be there.

Oh, yeah.
That's what I was hoping for: meerkats.

I won't be able to make our date night
this Thursday, so bad news for you.

You better have a good excuse this time.

Because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears
right is obvious nonsense.

First of all, when you say things like that,
people think you're crazy.

Second, the reason I'm canceling...

...is because l have to attend a memorial
service for Professor Tupperman.

-That sounds like a long and tedious evening.
-Ah, it will be.

Honestly, if l must endure
a long and tedious evening...

...I'd rather it be with you on date night.

But l have no choice.
The tenure committee is going to be there.

Oh, well, in that case,
perhaps l should come along.

Now that l think about it,
that would be helpful.

Of course it would.

I'm well versed in academic politics,
and as a respected scientist...

...I can only raise your stock
as a candidate.

Actually, I meant you could drive me.

But if it makes you happy,
that other stuff too.

-Do anything interesting today?
-Not really. I was out shopping with Amy.

She wanted me to help her find something
for this memorial.

What, Sheldon's going to be there?
We all promised we weren't gonna go.

-Oh. What a jerk.
-I know.

I was hoping to go
without anyone finding out.

Well, since Amy's going, do you want me
there, you know, to support you?

Oh. That's nice, but it's just gonna be
a room full of boring old men.

I'm not sure how much help you'd be.

Okay. I'm just gonna tie my shoe
while you think about that. Ahem.

Oh, yeah. No, thanks.
That would be great help.

-You realize you might kill some of them.
-Then you all can get tenure.

Come on, Daddy.
All the other scientists have seat warmers.

This is so humiliating.
I've got to get tenure.

Okay, let's meet halfway. How about I
cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week?

Looks like we're both going to be
living like animals.

Let's go over our emotional responses
one last time.

Okay.

Professor Tupperman is dead
and that makes us...?

Sad.

The fact that there are so many people here
doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic.

-It makes us...?
-Glad.

Giving Mrs. Davis the box set
of Roots was...?

Bad.

-However--
-No.

Fine, bad.

Unbelievable.

You have some nerve showing up
just to schmooze the tenure committee.

You're here.

Excuse me, l'm here to pay my respects
to Professor Tupperware...

...or whatever his name is.

So am l. His passing makes me feel bad.

Well, well, well, Sheldon,
fancy meeting you here.

I guess the train store in Glendale
wasn't having a cotillion after all.

And you.
You said you weren't coming here either.

I have a thick accent.
You don't know what I said.

-I'd like to know why Penny's here.
-I'm here to support my man, just like you.

What are you going to do?

Take people's drink orders
and get them wrong?

Do it.

What? Did she do it yet?

She plans on flirting with members of the
tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.

Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.

Don't just stand there,
take your breasts out.

Ooh, meerkat fight.

You're all wasting your time.
Sheldon is the most qualified for the job...

...and no amount of gravity-defying bosom
is gonna change that.

Seriously, is that tape?
Like, how are they staying up like that?

Way to hit them with both barrels.

You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

Using women to advance your cause
with sexuality...

...and whatever Amy plans on doing.

Are you implying my girlfriend...

-...has no sexuality to exploit?
-Yes.

-Okay, because that wasn't clear.
-Sheldon.

What? That was ambiguous.

Well, now it's biguous.
What are you gonna do about it?

-Um....
-Talk some smack about his mother.

Yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all.

Last night, l was feeling in need
of sexual release...

...when l happened to come across
your mother.

-Okay, guys, what are we doing here?
-I don't know what you're doing...

...but l was about to insinuate that
I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.

Well, you do what you want,
but l don't wanna lose my friends over tenure.

-Friends are forever.
-Ahem. So is tenure.

Walk.

I'm just gonna go home
and let my work speak for itself.

You're right. This is beneath me.

Like your mother was last night.

How about it, Sheldon?

What do you think l should do?

Well, you'll always
be an academic success...

...but l seriously question
whether you'll make any more friends.

Oh, I don't want any more, but let's go.

Are you kidding?
I would love to babysit for you.

JANlNE: l could not ask you to do that.
-Nonsense, children love me.

Something about me
just makes them laugh and laugh.

No, we cannot lose to that jerk.

-Yeah, screw it. l'm going in.
-Hold on.

"Screw it, I'm going in"
is what I said to your mother last night.

Don't worry, I didn't really say that.

I find the concept of coitus ridiculous
and off-putting.

Should have taken my breasts out
while l had the chance.

Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis.

I know you're in there.
I saw your car in the parking lot.

What?

I just found out
that you recommended myself...

...Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali
to be on the short list for tenure.

Well, despite your quirks...

...the three of you are very accomplished
in your respective fields.

I don't know what you mean by quirks,
but l do want to express my gratitude.

-You didn't bring another gift, did you?
-No, no, l learned my lesson.

-I understand that was inappropriate.
-Good.

-Anyway, thank you.
-You're welcome.

I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

Right on, sister.

[English - US - SDH]

Oh, dear.

Penny, have you been recording
shows on our DVR again?

-No.
-Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

That will come later.

Absolutely not.

Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

Uh, maybe we were hacked. The Chinese
have been hacking everything lately.

Why would the Chinese make our DVR
<i>record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?</i>

I don't know.

It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

-I'm deleting it.
-Hang on.

Maybe the Chinese
haven't finished watching it yet.

If you're trying to make space on the DVR...

...why don't you get rid of stuff
you've already watched? Like Alphas.

No, that's the season-two finale.
Quite the cliffhanger.

I'm gonna rewatch it
before season three starts.

There's no season three.
They canceled that show.

Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.

Well, they did.

There are two dumplings left.
Want them?

Dumplings? Don't you understand
what's going on here?

As a rule, no.

That show ended with all the residents
of New York either dead or unconscious.

Now l'll never know what happened.

Why don't you make up
your own ending?

Oh. Sure, what a wonderful idea.

And after that l'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene...

...and instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

I'm gonna get the number of
the Syfy Channel and give them what for.

Oh, please don't do that.

No. They can't just cancel
a show like Alphas.

They have to help the viewers let go.

Firelfy did a movie to wrap things up.

<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>
continued on as a comic book.

Heroes gradually lowered the quality
season by season...

...until we were grateful it ended.

I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

Ah, don't. lf they didn't wanna be
yelled at by crazy nerds...

...they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

I think you're gonna be really happy
with this security camera.

The optics are great.
It's got infrared technology.

And there's even a backup battery
when the power goes out.

Whatever. l can see my little princess
while l'm at work, right?

Why can't you watch porn
like a regular guy?

Give me your laptop so I can
configure the software.

Hold on. This is weird.

What?

I was Googling that girl l've been dating
and found her blog.

Cool. Anything juicy?

She said she recently went
on a date with a guy named Roger.

And he's Indian.

And he's an astrophysicist too!

-You know what's going on, don't you?
-Yes.

Mommy was right.
American girls are sexually voracious devils.

I can't believe I have to explain this.
People change names on blogs...

...to protect their privacy. "Roger" is Raj.

Oh.

I always thought if l had a white name,
it would be Gavin.

-Keep reading. What does it say?
-No, I don't know if I should.

If she wanted me to know about her blog,
she would've told me.

-It's almost like l'm reading her diary.
-It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

No, this is creepy.

Oh.... l think we were looking at creepy in the
rearview mirror when I put up that camera.

It's not creepy. Don't listen to him.

[lN BABY-TALK VOICE]
Ooh, who's got the sweetest kisses?

[SMOOCHlNG]

Should l go?

With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,
I had the greatest idea ever.

It blows away my idea for a Star Wars-themed
coffee shop called Brewbacca's.

<i>You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</i>
The perfect show for the two of us.

It's got action and jokes and hot vampires
and romance. I cannot oversell this.

What do you say?

It's 6:30 in the morning.

LEONARD:
I thought you grew up on a farm.

Hello, Syfy Network,
this is your vice president of programming.

We have made a horrible mistake
regarding Alphas.

We need to uncancel it immediately.

Put me through
to the people who handle that.

Tell them it's me.
I don't wanna answer a lot of questions...

...about if l really am who l say l am.

I just-- I want this done.

No, I'm not the person who just called.

That man was clearly a cowboy...

...concerned about y'all
canceling his favorite show.

Why do they keep hanging up on me?

I'm sorry you're upset.

Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort
of physical contact in moments like this.

I am not flying back to Texas
just so my mom can give me a hug.

Okay. Well, what I think is going on here...

...is you have a pathological need
for closure.

Oh. That's nonsense.

You tell me stories about your day
all the time. l don't care how they end.

You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

There's a field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines...

...ways to retrain your neural pathways
so stuff like this bothers you less.

But l just told you,
I don't have a problem with closure.

-You sure about that?
-Quite sure.

That proves nothing.

-Ready to go to lunch?
-Do you think l'm feminine?

-Yeah, let's go.
-Thanks a lot.

-What's going on?
-I broke down and l read Lucy's blog.

In one of the entries she said when we
first met, I struck her as a little feminine.

Just a little? That's great.

I have to talk to her about this.

Ahh. Jeez, why do you girls always want
to talk about things?

Listen to me, if she's writing about
your relationship, use it to your advantage.

-Rig the game.
-That doesn't seem fair.

Is it fair that girls like confident,
normal guys more than nervous weirdos?

No, it's not.
I've always thought that was unfair.

So take what's in that blog
and use it to get her pants off.

Why do you make everything filthy?
Why couldn't you say the blog is like...

...her giving me the key to her heart?

"The key to her heart." Heh. That's nice.

Were you quoting someone
or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

I was quoting a man who knows a thing
or two about women: Sir Elton John.

["BUFFY THE VAMPIRE PLAYER" THEME
PLAYlNG ON TV]

So did you love it? Of course you
loved it. Tell me how much you loved it.

It was cute.

Aw, don't say "cute." That's the worst.

-What's wrong with cute?
-It just makes things seem small.

It diminishes them.

So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

I don't understand how you can watch
a show that great and not be excited by it.

-I liked it. I'm excited.
-Well, then tell your face.

-What do you want from me?
-You know what? Never mind.

We gave it a shot.
Let's just see what else is on.

Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I'm sorry I called it cute.

-Let's watch another one.
-Really?

Yeah. lt was fun.
It kind of reminded me of my high school.

But instead of vampires,
we had meth-heads. Ahem.

But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

All right, cool.
I think you'll like the next one better.

All the cheerleaders
are suffering from an evil curse.

Oh. Well, that's like my high school too.

But instead of a curse, it was crabs. Heh.

I've come up with a series of exercises
to help with your compulsive need for closure.

I take issue with the word "compulsive."

All l'm saying is we live in a world
where closure isn't always an op--

--tion! Okay!

For the sake of argument,
let's say l have a problem.

What would be your plan
for addressing it?

I'm going to recondition your brain...

...so that the need for completion
isn't so overwhelming.

-By playing tic-tac-toe?
-Yep, your turn.

Oh, Amy. And you wonder why
people think neuroscience...

...is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw.

None of which will deny me closure,
especially since I'm about to win.

But we didn't finish.

Exactly. How does that make you feel?

The same way
any normal person would.

Feel like l wanna peel off my own face,
tear it in two and then again and again...

...until I have a handful of
Sheldon-face confetti.

That's the feeling we want to address
with this treatment.

Yeah. Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril
and help me get this face off.

Come on. You can do this.

You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

To have a desire build up within you
and be denied any opportunity for release.

Yeah, sounds like a drag.

["BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER" THEME
PLAYlNG ON TV]

Okay, help me out here.
Why does he love this show so much?

Well, there was action, it was funny.

I mean, you do get that usually
the monster chases the pretty girl...

...but this time the pretty girl
chases the monsters?

Yippee, it's backwards, l get it.

Why does this bother you so much?

I don't know. It's just, he's so passionate
about so many different things.

I just don't get that way. Do you?

Well, sure.
I'm pretty passionate about science.

I remember the first time l looked through
a microscope and saw tiny microorganisms.

It was like a whole other universe.

If I wanted to, l could wipe it out
with my thumb like a god.

See, l wish l had
some of that fire in my life.

I wanna care about things
and get excited like you guys.

-There's no reason you can't.
-You think?

Absolutely. All we need to do is spend time
and find something you're passionate about.

Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.

<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

Lucy's coming over. l need some advice.

<i>However long you think</i>
<i>the foreplay should be, triple it.</i>

Just tell me which one you think
is more manly.

This hockey jersey or this football jersey?

<i>I don't know. Go with hockey.</i>

Good, black is more slimming.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

That's her. l gotta go be butch. Toodles.

-[lN DEEP VOICE] Hey. Come in.
-Hi.

-Aw. Look how cute your little doggie is.
-Yeah, l wouldn't get too close.

If I give the right command in German,
she'll rip your face off.

That's an impressive layout, isn't it?

Yes.

Let's box it up.

[lMlTATES AMY]
Let's box it up.

["POP GOES THE WEASEL"
PLAYlNG ON BOX]

That's enough.

-Sheldon, give it!
-No!

Okay, Sheldon,
make a wish and blow out the candles.

Oops. Missed one.
Now your wish can't come true.

Lucky for you,
because l wished you were dead.

-I like your jersey.
-Thanks, l love hockey.

Cool, so does my dad.

We watched it all the time growing up.
Who's your favorite player?

Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure.

-How's your burrito?
-Still a little frozen in the middle.

Probably because l didn't read the instructions.
No wrapper's gonna tell me what to do.

Unless his name is Jay-Z.

-Is something going on?
-What do you mean?

Well, you're acting all weird,
and I'm pretty weird...

...so l think I know what l'm talking about.

I don't know, maybe it's all those
steroids I've been taking.

I think I'm gonna go. Thank you
for the burrito and the pork rinds...

...and the 20-minute lecture on why
monster trucks are better than regular trucks.

Wait, wait.

I found your blog
where you wrote about me.

Oh. I just write that for myself.
I didn't think anybody actually read it.

No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find.
I spent hours digging around online.

For the record, you have excellent credit
and your diabetic aunt...

...seems to be adjusting to her new leg
just fine.

Why were you acting so strange tonight?

You called me "feminine."

I wanted you to think I was more manly.

Raj, l didn't say feminine was a bad thing.

I meant you're sweet and thoughtful
and your skin looks so much like caramel...

...I just want to dip an apple in your face.

I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall
moisturizing regimen.

So are you okay?

-Yeah.
-Good.

-Do you even like hockey?
-Heh. No.

I bought this at the Staples Center
when l went to see Taylor Swift.

So I was thinking how excited you get
about stuff like Buffy or science...

...or which TV remote
you and Sheldon should buy--

The Harmony One was fine.
We didn't need the 1 1 00...

...which he knows is too big for my hand.

See, that's the kind of passion
I didn't think l had.

But then l realized
I'm passionate about you.

Oh. My cute little tushy strikes again.

I'm serious. l've always had these plans.
I was gonna be in movies...

...and live this glamorous life,
and anything less than that...

-...wasn't worth getting excited about.
-Those things can still happen.

Obviously, it's gonna happen.
A psychic at a bachelorette party told me.

Anyway, what I meant was
I shouldn't wait, you know?

I've got you, l've got Sheldon...

...and all these wonderful friends.

My life is exciting right now.

-That's a big deal.
-It is, isn't it?

[CHUCKLES]

So does that mean we get to do stuff
like talk about cool shows...

...or get dressed up in matching costumes
and go to Comic-Con?

Leonard, l had an epiphany, not a stroke.

Amy, l must say, l was skeptical at first...

...but this has truly been
a transformative evening.

I'm a little surprised to hear you
feeling so positive.

Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist,
you're a wonderful girlfriend...

...and....

-And?
-Doesn't matter, does it?

I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

And a complete sucker.

Oh, yeah.

I love you too.

Hello, is this the Bruce Miller
who wrote the season finale ofAlphas?

Oh, smashing. You already sound nicer
than the last Bruce Miller...

...who suggested l have sexual relations
with myself. Now, down to business.

Your show ended on a cliffhanger.

Could you please tell me
how you planned to resolve it?

Uh-huh.

Mm-hm.

I see.

Well, that all stinks.
No wonder you got canceled. Bye.

Ah.

[English - US - SDH]

The interface is pretty simple.

You put your horizontal X-coordinate here,
vertical Y-coordinate here.

When you're happy with those,
press this button.

Got it.

Leonard, you'll never guess
who l just found online. Hey.

-Nice shot.
-Eh, his giant head did most of the work.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

Very mature.
You're lucky l'm out of Silly String.

As l was saying, Leonard,
you'll never guess who l just found online.

-Professor Proton.
-You're kidding.

-He's still alive?
-Yes.

-Who's Professor Proton?
-He was the host of this great-- Hey.

Yes. Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.

Professor Proton hosted my favorite
science show when l was a child.

I never missed an episode.

He demonstrated scientific principles
using everyday objects.

It was pretty cool.

Aw. lt's so cute when you use
the word "cool" wrong.

Like when kids say "pasghetti."

Oh, dear Lord. Leonard, look.

He's still available for parties and events.

-We should hire him.
-Hire him to do what?

Whatever we want.
Hang out, do experiments...

...make him take 1 2 pictures with us
so we can make a calendar.

It would be awesome to hang out with him.
I just used "awesome" wrong, didn't I?

Well, I'm e-mailing him right now.

-Do you remember his old theme song?
-Of course I do.

BOTH [SINGlNG]:
<i>Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on</i>

<i>Here he comes, Professor Proton</i>

Hey, uh, l just found out I have to be
at the telescope lab all weekend.

Any chance you and Bernadette
could take care of my dog?

-Why don't you put her in a kennel?
-Why don't you put your mother in a home?

To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel.

-I'll talk to Bernie. l'm sure it's fine.
-Thank you.

It's happening. Leonard, it's happening.

Professor Proton is coming to our house.

You're kidding.

You mean the guy who used to host
that lame kids show?

And you just got yourself uninvited.

See, l told you l'd find a tactful way
to do that.

-How'd you get him to come to your house?
-As Professor Proton always says:

"There is no problem you can't solve
if you use your noggin."

-And he wrote him a check.
-Yeah, that too. Big check.

Uncle Howard.

Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party.

You know if you had a stroke,
she'd eat you, right?

And it would be my pleasure
to be her num-num.

Okay, so, what do l need to know
to take care of her?

It's very simple.

For breakfast, she has an egg white frittata.

Give her a choice of home fries
or an English muffin.

But not both. We're watching our weight.

Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop,
some scampi, whatever you like.

-Classy dog.
-Yes.

Also, don't forget to close the toilet
or she'll drink out of it.

I feel for you. Heh.

I've got a psychotic mommy too.

SHELDON:
Leonard, are you in bed?

Yes.

SHELDON:
Me too.

Great.

SHELDON:
I can't sleep.

[LEONARD SlGHS]

Well, I can, so shut up.

SHELDON: Do you realize that
in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries...

...a.k.a. Professor Proton,
will be in our apartment?

You know if you stay up all night,
you're going to be sleepy tomorrow.

And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon.
And a cranky Sheldon...

...is actually no different
than a regular Sheldon. Good night.

SHELDON:
I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.

That's not ridiculous. Good night.

SHELDON:
Do you have cufflinks?

-No.
-Just as well.

Where can you rent a tuxedo
at 3:00 in the morning?

Okay. Good night.

SHELDON:
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.

Nice to meet you, Profe--

[SLAP]
SHELDON: Ow!

SHELDON:
Leonard?

What?

SHELDON:
I still can't sleep.

She really, uh, tuckered herself out
at the park, huh?

Yeah. You two were so cute
playing together.

It was kind of fun throwing a ball
and not having anyone laugh at me.

And you were sweet not to throw it too far
so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.

Heh, yeah, that's what I was doing.

There were a few moments today
when l felt like we were a little family.

-Really?
-Yeah.

I never thought of myself as a mom,
but when we were out...

...I felt like someday we could do it.

Of course we can.

Especially if our baby's
as calm and quiet as little Cinnam--

Son of a bitch, she's gone!

-Well, where'd she go?
-I don't know. She didn't leave a note.

You were supposed to put her
back in the stroller.

-No, I wasn't. You were.
-No, I wasn't.

-Yes, you were.
-Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.

I'm getting worried.

Relax, Sheldon,
he's only a few minutes late.

Professor Proton was never late
when he was on TV.

You know, every day, 4:00, he was there.

Unless tornadoes were ripping apart
East Texas, then we'd join him in progress.

[CELL PHONE RlNGING]

It's him.

Hello?

Well, I see.

Yes.

All right, we can come get you.
Yeah, we'll see you soon.

-Bye.
-Where is he?

The third floor landing. The poor old guy's
been walking up the stairs for half an hour.

It's really you.

Mr. Jeffries, l am so sorry.

We should have told you
about the broken elevator.

I agree.

Professor Proton,
it's an honor to meet you.

Uh, just call me Arthur.

Leonard...

...did you hear that?

Professor Proton said
I should call him Arthur.

That means we're friends.

No, a friend would have told me
about the elevator.

Look at me.

I can get as close to you as l want without
my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.

Is, uh, he dangerous?

Actually, he's a genius.

I am.

That doesn't answer my question.

Mr. Jeffries, l'm Leonard.
This is my girlfriend, Penny.

-Hi.
-Hello.

Well, I hope l haven't, uh, kept the kids waiting
too long for the show.

Oh, no, there are no kids.
No, the show's for me.

Come on, I'll race you...

...Arthur.

ARTHUR:
Is the blond girl really your girlfriend?

LEONARD: Yes, sir.
-You're the genius.

So do you do a lot of appearances
like this?

It's hard to say.
I'm still trying to figure out...

...what this is.

We just wanted to hang out with you
and maybe learn a little about your life.

Well, there really isn't too much to tell.

After the TV show was canceled...

...nobody in the scientific world
would take me seriously...

...so l was forced to do these
children's parties to make a living.

That's too bad. But still, working with kids,
it must be rewarding.

You get bit a lot.

Let me see if I have this straight.

You two are physicists...

...and you want me to do
a children's science show?

Yes.

And if there's time, take 1 2 pictures with us
in seasonal clothing.

You know, I'm a real scientist.

I have a PhD from Cornell University.

Yeah, that's great.
Did you bring your puppet?

No. No.

I hate that puppet.

Oh, no.

How could anybody hate
Gino the Neutrino?

It's nice, huh?

I got him for 20 bucks on eBay.

Including the shipping.

I'm awake, right?

This is happening?

-Cinnamon!
-Cinnamon!

You know, maybe she doesn't recognize
her name because of Raj's accent.

Good thinking.

[MlMlCS RAJESH]
Cinnamon, come to Daddy.

[MlMlCS RAJESH]
Cinnamon, where are you, my little lamb chop?

-Nice. Heh.
-Thanks.

When this all blows over,
remember that voice.

It's kind of a turn-on. Heh.

It turns you on when I sound like Raj?

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Cinnamon!

Okay, as l put the egg on top...

...and the flame goes out...

...and the air pressure decreases
in the flask...

...what do you think will happen?

-I think I know.
-It's gonna get sucked in.

It's going to get sucked in.

Okay, I didn't know.

Yes.

See, l'm not a scientist like them. Heh.

I figured that out.

-Potato clock. Do potato clock.
-What's that?

I power a clock with a potato.

Shut up. You can do that?

I mean, heh, wouldn't that solve
the world's energy crisis?

No.

Look, guys, keep your money.
I think I'm done.

What's wrong? Is she upsetting you?
Because l can make her go away.

No, she's the only reason
I've stayed this long.

Then what is it?

I don't know. I think I'm just--

I just don't want to be
Professor Proton anymore.

Well, how can you say that?
Professor Proton's the best.

What has it ever gotten me?

I mean, I'm an 83-year-old man
who has potatoes in his suitcase.

Other scientists think I'm a joke.

And the puppeteer who did Gino...

...well, he also...

...did my wife.

Mr. Jeffries, l need to show you something.

-I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
-Uh, thanks.

But if you don't mind me asking, uh,
the potato clock, how does it work?

Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?

What do you two talk about?

I wrote a fan letter to you
when l was a child in Texas...

...and you sent this autographed picture
back to me.

Do you remember that?

I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet
with my own address on it.

Well, anyway, um,
you may find this hard to believe...

...but l didn't have any friends growing up.

No, I get that.

But, um, l did have you.

And every day at 4:00,
you'd come to my house on Channel 68...

...and we'd do science together.

If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows
what would have become of me, you know?

Instead of a world-class physicist,
I could've wound up as a hobo...

...or a surgeon.

I bet there are important discoveries
being made every day...

...because you inspired millions of kids
to pursue science.

In a way, their discoveries
are your discoveries.

It's true. A generation of young scientists
are standing on your shoulders.

Well, thank you, guys. That means a lot.

Well, it's important you know
how much you mean to us.

-Uh-oh.
-Arthur, are you okay?

I'm having...

...a problem with my pacemaker.

I'll call for help.

Any chance we could plug it in
to the potato?

No.

[CELL PHONE RlNGS]

Hello?

What do you mean you found my dog?
She's with my friends.

Is she okay?

Thank you. Uh, just text me your address,
I'm on my way.

If she's hungry, go ahead and feed her
but do not give her anything starchy.

She's having risotto for dinner.

Your vitals are stable, but let's take you in
for tests just to be safe.

-Want one of us to go in the ambulance?
-I'll do it.

He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?

-No, it's not a rule. He can go.
-Oh, yes.

I can't catch a break today.

We'll pack up your stuff,
meet you at the hospital.

Sorry things turned out this way.

Well, at this point, I'm just glad
someone's carrying me down the stairs.

Met my childhood hero,
now l get to ride in an ambulance.

Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar,
this will be the best day ever.

I can't believe we lost her.

What was l thinking? l'd be a terrible mom.

Maybe with the first one.

But kids are like pancakes,
the first one's always a throwaway.

-How's this look?
-It's fine.

-Where'd you get that picture of her?
-It's not her. I Googled "foo-foo little dogs."

[SKYPE JlNGLE PLAYlNG ON COMPUTER]

It's Raj. Stay quiet.

Hey, heh, bad timing. Bernadette just took
Cinnamon out for a walk.

<i>Interesting. Did they take a walk</i>
<i>down Liars' Lane?</i>

-What?
<i>-A lane frequented by liars.</i>

<i>Like you, you big liar.</i>

-You have her?
-Thank God she's okay.

<i>Well, I trusted you and you let me down.</i>
<i>The poor thing's been shaking for hours.</i>

-I'm really sorry.
-Hang on, you've had her for hours?

<i>Yes. l picked her up and then we both went</i>
<i>for massages to try and calm down.</i>

<i>And then we got Pinkberry.</i>

You knew she was okay and you couldn't
pick up the phone to tell us?

<i>-Well, I thought about--</i>
-Don't "well" me, mister.

We've been worried sick.

She could have been dead for all we knew.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

<i>-Sorry, l just--</i>
-Sorry's not good enough.

Maybe you need to take some time
and think about what you've done.

Nice guilt trip. Heh.
You are gonna be an amazing mom.

<i>Purr, purr, purr</i>

Thank you, Sheldon. That was very nice.

-Want me to sing it again?
-No.

The fourth time was the charm.

There anything l can get for you?
Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?

No, no, thank you, but l do
have a favor to ask.

-Name it.
-Well, I'm booked to do...

...a children's party tomorrow...

...and frankly, l don't feel up to it.

Oh, you're not. You look awful.

Thank you.

Anyway, uh, you know
my act better than anybody...

...I was hoping that
maybe you'd fill in for me.

Are you saying that you want me
to be Professor Proton?

-Yeah.
-Oh, my.

What an honor.
Oh, this is like being asked to...

...ascend Mount Olympus
and dine with the gods.

Or a Korean family in Alhambra.

But they'll know I'm not you.

Should l call myself Professor Proton, Jr?

Sounds great.

So in a way, it's like l'm your son.

Whatever.

Father.

Sure, what the hell.

[English - US - SDH]

-Burbank Airport, please.
-Vegas, here we come!

No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.

No rules?

We're not gonna get drunk and have
a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?

-No.
-So there are some rules.

Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends
and some rules.

Thank you. Vegas!

-The ladies are away, the boys will play!
-Anything can happen!

-It's gonna get crazy.
-Dungeons & Dragons!

I got a brand new bikini
so drinks at the pool are on these.

I got a sexy new tube top
that says "come hither"...

...and a can of pepper spray that says,
"Close enough, Jack."

I got some old underwear l'm gonna throw
onstage at the Garth Brooks concert.

I'm sorry, why old?

Because last time I saw him,
I threw new ones and it got me nothing.

I've got a brand new seven-piece
set of polyhedral dice.

Hello, new dice smell.

I've got my Helm of Lordly Might,
my Boots of Speed...

...and if things get too exciting,
my lnhaler of Asthma.

I've got my new, bloodthirsty,
Savage Warrior...

...who will lay waste
to all who stand before him.

And I had a sensible salad for lunch
so I can eat all the pizza I want.

Come on, are we gonna sit around
chatting like a bunch of teenage girls...

...or play D&D like teenage boys who will
never have sex with those teenage girls?

[lN UNISON]
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

[lN UNISON] The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko,
Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko...

...the Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko.

I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight.

Saved me the awkward conversation about
how l was gonna be hanging with my bros.

Isn't every conversation you two
have awkward? Heh.

Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone
that if no one talks for three minutes...

...you can just hang up.

I'm so into her.

-Ready whenever you guys are.
-Yeah, we'll be right there.

-Leonard.
LEONARD: Yeah?

I'm not sure how l feel about Howard
being Dungeon Master instead of you.

Aw. That's nice, but relax,
sometimes change is good.

You were worried about Zachary Quinto
being the new Spock...

...but you wound up liking him.

Please. Every time the topic of change comes
up you throw Zachary Quinto in my face.

I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut,
"Zachary Quinto."

I'm upset that daylight saving time started,
"Zachary Quinto."

Daylight saving time ended,
"Zachary Quinto."

For the last time, Zachary Quinto
was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event.

So stop using him against me.

Okay, here we go.

You find yourselves in an overgrown,
old forest.

Before you is a giant oak tree
with a face on it...

...that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.

He says:

[MlMlCS NlCHOLAS CAGE]
"Travel with caution...

These woods are home...

...to the bones
of many a fallen hero."

Now, see? Howard's just as good
a Dungeon Master as l am.

As good? You just got pantsed
in the schoolyard, four-eyes.

Hey, come on, guys, focus.

Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree.

We thank you for your warning,
but we are brave warriors...

...and nothing short of death
will keep us from our goal.

[PHONE CHlMES]

Oh. Lucy's free after all, see you.

No, no, no, hey, hey, hey,
you can't leave, we just started.

You're right, l should finish the game.
I take my plus-one long sword...

...stab myself in the face with it.
I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl. Bye.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
We'll be fine. Watch.

Ahem. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from
Koothrappali's bloody corpse and says:

[MlMlCS RAJESH] "Don't worry, buddies. Ghost
Raj will help guide you through the forest."

[MlMlCS NlCHOLAS CAGE] I'm just a tree,
but if I were you, l'd listen to your ghost friend.

Go on. Give him your lunch money.

I'm very happy you were able to hang out.

Me too.

Not that it's up to you to make me happy.
Unless you find neediness sexy...

...in which case you're with
the hottest man on the planet. Heh.

Can l tell you something?

I was so nervous about seeing you...

...before I left my apartment, l put roll-on
antiperspirant all over my body.

-Really?
-Yeah.

If sweat starts squirting out
the top of my head, you'll know why.

I'm sorry to put you through that.

It's okay. l'm trying to force myself
to do things that make me scared.

What else have you been
thinking about doing?

Well, let's see.

I'd love to be able to tell the lady
who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.

-I like your bangs.
-Thanks, l like them too.

-What else?
-Hmm.

It's a tie between sending food back
in a restaurant...

...and saying no to kids
who sell magazines door to door.

Those are both toughies.

I know. I have a two-year subscription
<i>to Guns and Ammo.</i>

I push my shoulder against
the secret door to see if it gives way.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Uh-huh. lt does.

[MlMlCS DOOR CREAKlNG]

He does sound effects too.

Hey, I always did sound effects.

Uh, a swarm of bloodthirsty bats
fly through the dungeon.

[MlMlCS BATS SUCKLING]

Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.

[MlMlCS UNlCORN GROANlNG]

[MlMlCS BATS SUCKLING]

Okay, well, l have a sound effect
for those sound effects.

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]

-Guess who?
-What are you doing back?

That's an excellent question. Amy?

Uh, well...

...when we were going through security,
I got pulled out of line for a pat-down.

The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy.

I may have broken her nose
with my elbow.

Long story short, she's on the no-fly list...

...and we might have been
followed here by a drone.

-I'm sorry. l feel like such an idiot.
-Oh, it's not so bad. You lost money...

...you're filled with shame, you got groped
by a stranger. That's Vegas, you nailed it.

You guys enjoy your evening. l'm gonna go
before I ruin anybody else's weekend.

That's my girl.

Amy, wait. I know it's not the night
you had in mind...

...but why don't you stay and play?
It'll be fun.

Fun?

Three weeks ago you bought
crunchy peanut butter...

...now you want the girls to play D&D
with-- Do you have a drug problem?

What's the big deal? Raj bailed,
so we could use some extra players.

I've just never played
Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.

Oh, don't worry, sweetie. No one has.

So, what do you say?

I'll leave it up to the Dungeon Master.

A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously
like Al Pacino...

...rises from the forest floor and says:

[MlMlCS AL PACINO]
"You're playing D&D...

...you're playing D&D...

...this whole apartment...

...is playing D&D."

Okay, who wants a drink?

Penny, we don't consume alcohol during
Dungeons & Dragons.

It impairs our judgment.

Oh, this isn't alcohol.
It's a magic potion that makes me like you.

Double potion, please.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Here we go.

You find yourselves face to face
with two hulking ogres.

[lN DEEP VOICE]
"What are you doing in our dungeon?"

"You shall die."

Okay, literal goosebumps. Look.

-[lN NORMAL VOICE] What do you do?
-I draw my broadsword.

-I ready my quarter-staff.
-I drink my potion.

-I say we attack the big one.
-Give me the dice. I wanna roll.

The Dungeon Master's supposed to roll.

Yeah, well, l'm supposed to be in Vegas
throwing up on a shrimp buffet, give it.

-All right, what do I need?
-Uh, fifteen or higher.

Fifteen's the point. The point is 1 5. Give the
little lady some room. Here it is. Coming out.

-Sixteen! Yeah.
-Yeah.

Please tell me we're playing for money.

Oh, even better than money.
You gained experience points.

-More potion, please.
-Yeah.

-How are your crab cakes?
-Kind of funky.

-That's great.
-It is?

Does "funky" mean
something different in lndia?

No, no. You've always wanted to send your
food back in a restaurant. Here's your chance.

-That's okay. l just won't eat them.
-Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?

Everything all right?

Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?

Yes.

-Okay, thanks, bye.
-Hold on.

Isn't there something else
you wanted to tell him?

No, it's fine. He's from a different country.
He doesn't understand our ways.

Don't be silly. Just tell him.

I have to go to the bathroom. And it's not
because the crab cakes are funky.

-So you're okay here?
-Uh, yeah, sorry. She's just a little shy.

The first time we met, she was so nervous...

...she climbed out
a bathroom window to get away.

Uh-oh.

Hey, Raj?

Funny story.

Come on, Mama wants
a pair of dead ogres.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
Seventeen! The larger ogre is dead.

[ALL CHEERING]

The other ogre says:

[lN DEEP VOICE]
"You killed my brother."

"Now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."

That is amazing.
He made me care about the ogre.

All right, Amy, there's one ogre left.
Take him out.

-Okay.
-Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.

Nineteen.

[ALL CHEERING]

-This is turning out to be better than Vegas.
-Ha, ha. No, it's not.

Lucy?

Hey, long time no see.

You don't know me very well,
but each time you crawl out a window...

...to escape my company,
it chips away at my masculinity.

-I'm sorry.
-Why would you leave like that?

You were pushing me.
I didn't want to send my food back...

...and you tried to make me do it.

If I upset you,
why didn't you say something?

How can l tell you I'm upset
if l can't tell the woman at Supercuts...

...that my forehead's my best feature?

-It's scary.
-Well, I like you a lot and that's scary for me.

Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.

How could you like me a lot?

Well.... For one thing, you have
bigger emotional problems than l do...

...and I find that very attractive in a woman.

I don't know, I just....

I think you're wonderful.

I'm sweating out of my head.

[lN NORMAL VOICE] The dragon falls
from the sky, crashing into the volcano.

[ALL CHEERING]

But wait, he's not dead.

He crawls out, spreads his wings
and prepares to attack--

Wait.

Doesn't he say something first?

Maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?

Fine.

[MlMlCS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN]
"You'd think, after all these years...

...I'd know not to fly over volcanoes.

I'm a frigging idiot."

The dragon's Christopher Walken. Perfect.

Amy, it's your turn.
We need one more hit. Finish him off.

Here we go. Fifteen.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
It's a hit, the dragon collapses to the ground.

Wait, wait.

And says....

[MlMlCS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN]
"Mother? ls that you?

Your little boy is coming home."

I don't know about you guys, but l've been
through the emotional wringer tonight.

This may be the potion talking, but you are
one fine-ass Dungeon Master.

[lN NORMAL VOICE] When we get home,
I'm gonna take you on a different adventure.

Another quest by Wolowitz?
Count me in.

-Sheldon, they're talking about sex.
-Oh, then I'm out.

Ooh, I have an idea.

Since it's not happening
anytime soon...

...why don't your character
and your character do it in the game?

Ooh!

-Come on, back me up here.
-Oh.

[lN UNISON]
Ooh!

Okay. I cast a love spell
on Sheldon and Amy.

Ooh!
Sorry, l thought you were gonna do that....

The love spell takes effect.
When Sheldon looks at Amy...

...she is the most beautiful half-orc
he's ever seen...

...and he's overcome with a desire to rip
her armor off...

...and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.

When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks...

...just like Sheldon
because apparently she's into that.

What do you do?

I don't like this.

You see what happens
when you let girls play D&D?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Amy. Amy. Amy.

What?

I've never knocked on my own door before.

That was a wild ride.

You don't have to come in here
and cheer me up.

Thank you.

Would you tell everyone else that?
Because they sure think otherwise.

I'll tell you what they think.

They think our relationship is a joke.

I don't think our relationship is a joke.

I think, "A horse goes into a bar, bartender
says, 'Why the long face?"', that's a joke.

It's a good one too,
because a horse has a long face.

Sheldon...

...are we ever going to have
an intimate relationship?

Oh, my, that's an uncomfortable topic.

Amy....

Before l met you...

...I never had any interest in being intimate
with anyone.

And now?

And now what?

Do you have any interest now?

I have not ruled it out.

Wow. Talk dirty to me.

I know it doesn't seem like it to you,
but for me, what we have...

...is extremely intimate.

I guess l know that.

It's just...

...I think part of me wants more.

More?

Look at us. It's only been three years,
here we are in bed together.

Come on.

Let's go back out there.

Well, no, hold on.

My elven magic-user
and your half-orc warrior...

...did have a love spell cast on them.

We wouldn't really be playing the game right
if we didn't see that through.

Okay.

I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.

While the others pillage the corpse...

...I lead you to a secluded area...

...where l attempt to remove
your leather armor.

-It comes off.
-Oh.

What do you do?

I...

...kiss you on the lips.

I kiss you back on the...

...lips as well.

Your turn.

I remove your armor.

What do you do?

I erotically caress your...

-...nose.
-Keep rolling.

Hey, you guys have been in there a while.
You doing okay?

SHELDON:
We're fine, thank you.

-Okay, we just want to say we feel bad--
AMY: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my....

[DIE CLATTERS]

Fourteen! Yes!

[English - US - SDH]

So anyway, last night on video chat, l spent,
like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

-That sounds romantic.
-It was, until I realized the screen had frozen.

Still one of my top three dates of all time.

So we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

Ahh, l'd love that, but she's not
really comfortable around people.

Yeah, l used to be uncomfortable
around people, but then l learned a trick.

I pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek.

How's that working for you?

Oh, like a charm,
unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

Leonard, l may have gotten you a job.

-I have a job.
-Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.

No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's
team is sending an expedition...

...to the North Sea to test
hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

One of their experimental physicists
dropped out and l recommended you.

Well, do you really think l have a shot?

Yeah, l've worked with Hawking,
I talked you up. He knows your research.

-I think this could happen.
-He kno--?

Wow.

Wait, now, but do you think
that's a good idea?

You know Star Trek.

Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.

No one asked you, Uhura.

Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

-What do you think?
-Great.

I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents...

...happen on or around boats?

Interesting that you would bring that up
when l might go work on a boat.

Well, that's the thing about factoids,
they're interesting.

I know what you're doing.

You don't want me going on this trip
because you're afraid to be alone.

I'm not afraid to be alone.

On land.

On the sea, it would be terrifying.

Because of all the drowning.

-Sheldon.
-Fine, no more drowning talk.

I'll change the subject.

Who do you think would win in a fight...

...you or a shark?

Look, l appreciate your signature blend of
concern for me and incredible selfishness...

...but if I get the chance to do this, there's
nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

Very well.

Things between you and Penny
have never been better.

I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.

I should've opened with that, huh?

If you look carefully at Venus...

...you should be able to see
the lnternational Space Station pass by.

Wow, your friend was actually up there?

Yeah, he brought me back
a T-shirt that said:

"My Friend Went to the Space Station
and All l Got Was This Lousy T-shirt."

Did he take the T-shirt to space?

Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

Speaking of friends,
they have been asking to meet you.

I was thinking maybe
we could all hang out sometime?

I don't know, how many are there?

Let's see. Six.

That's pretty cool. l have six friends.

I'm kind of like Sinatra.

Six strangers, that's a lot of pressure.

Staring at me, asking me
personal questions like, "What do you do?

Where are you from? Why did you
lock yourself in the bathroom?"

Okay, how about you just
dip your toe in and meet one of them?

-Will you be there?
-Of course.

Well, that's two. Three if you count me.
This is getting out of hand.

So then, during my afternoon shift,
I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

-Oh, that's awful.
-Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.

So listen, do you remember
when l said the similarities...

...of the equations of general relativity
and hydrodynamics...

...suggest you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?

I thought I said that to you.

Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking
into that, and I've been invited to join them.

Wow, Hawking. Good for you.

Well, it is,
just, you know, l'd be gone for a while.

-Well, how long?
-Three, four months.

Whoa.

-When would you leave?
-Couple of weeks.

Wow.

-Okay, well, l'll just come visit you.
-That's the thing, you can't.

I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

On a ship? Aren't they afraid
Hawking will just roll overboard?

He's not gonna be there. He's just
sending a team to research his theory.

Oh, sure. Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

Oh. Okay. So four months.

Yeah.

And I'm a little worried because
things between us have been so great...

...and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

If you're gonna screw things up...

...it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

And I'm just basing that on how much
I didn't understand what you said about it.

Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements
in the morning.

Okay, good.

-I do have to ask you one favor.
-Sure.

Sheldon's nervous about me leaving,
keep an eye on him while l'm gone.

Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened
when l took care of your goldfish?

Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet
and get me a new one.

[LAUGHS]

Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going away party.

Are you kidding me?
How often can you say bon voyage...

...to somebody when they're
actually going on a voyage?

Hello, Rajesh.

[WHlSPERlNG INDlSTlNCTLY]

[lN lNDlAN ACCENT]
Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

[WHlSPERlNG INDlSTlNCTLY]

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
What can l say, it's funnier with the accent.

There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys
really don't need to make a big deal.

Leonard, you're being selfish.

We need to give you a proper send-off
so we'll have closure...

...when you die at sea
and crabs eat your face.

Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

One of the things that helped me get through
Howard being in space for so long...

...was getting married before he left.

Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

Okay, I have a request to make.

And now he can talk.

I want to cut open your brain
and see what the heck's going on in there.

The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.

Anyway, I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all.

She thought it would be easier
for her to start with just one.

Gee, I don't know,
my schedule is a little busy.

Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

Well, thank you, Raj, l'd be honored.

What the hell?
I thought I was your best friend.

You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality...

...with your flashy clothes
and your Woody Allen swagger.

Maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.

-Good idea. Bernadette?
-What the hell?

Well, you're very pretty, that could
be intimidating to another woman.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, you don't think l'm pretty enough
to scare your girlfriend?

Calm down, Bernie, you're very scary.

It should be me.

Why? So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?

A, that was not a joke,
that was a sincere request.

And B, more importantly,
I was the outsider to this group...

...and I know how frightening that can be.

But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved, like I was family.

Fine, l'll do it.

So after I started dating Sheldon,
I met Leonard and then everybody else...

...and they've all been so wonderful to me.

That's really nice to hear.

Maybe next week we could all get together.

Lucy, you don't have to answer that.

Don't put her on the spot,
she hates that. Am l right?

Tell her how much you hate being
put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.

He's a little nervous...

...because he doesn't think l understand
the severity of your social anxiety.

You can't talk about social anxiety
to someone who has social anxiety...

...it makes them socially anxious.

Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist,
I think I'm more qualified than you...

...to understand what's not working
in your girlfriend's brain.

Don't call her my girlfriend.

We haven't discussed whether
we're girlfriend and boyfriend yet.

Now that it's out there...

...are you my girlfriend? By the way,
if you say no, I'll never be happy again.

Not to put you on the spot.

I think I have to go to the bathroom.

[DOOR SHUTS]

We might as well go ahead and eat.
She's not coming back any time soon.

This is ridiculous.
We're shopping for a party.

This store doesn't have a party section.

Yeah, it does, and here we are.

I have to say, Penny,
I don't understand why you, of all people...

...are encouraging Leonard to do this.

Well, I'm his girlfriend,
of course l'm gonna support him.

Well, you're his girlfriend for now.

Maybe you're not aware of this,
but there is a rich tradition of men at sea...

...finding comfort in each other's arms
and britches.

Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?

He gets to work with Stephen Hawking, who,
by the way, will not be on the boat, I checked.

It's not that big of an opportunity. l mean,
even if Hawking's theories are correct...

...all they prove is
where the universe came from...

...why everything exists
and what its ultimate end will be.

Me? I'm interested in the big questions.

Oh, my God,
Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.

I'm not jealous.

I'm just very unhappy that good things are
happening for him and not happening for me.

Sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel.

Just because good things
are happening to Leonard...

...doesn't take anything away from you.
Let me tell you a story.

There was a girl who worked
at the Cheesecake Factory...

-...and she wasn't good at her job.
-It was you.

It wasn't me.

But she was also an actress.

We were both up for the same part
in a toothpaste commercial. She got it.

I was so jealous, but instead of
ripping out her fake blond hair--

You ripped out your own fake blond hair.

I looked her in the eye, smiled and said,
"l'm happy for you."

Because that's what friends do.

They lie so they don't look petty.

-Yeah.
-How?

Like this.

I am so happy for you.

Wow.

No wonder you didn't get
that toothpaste commercial.

-Hey.
<i>-Hey.</i>

I want to apologize for Amy last night.
She was completely out of line.

Are you not speaking to me
or did the screen freeze again?

<i>Amy wasn't the problem.</i>

Okay, I know, it was me.

I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

<i>Thank you.</i>

You know, I've been thinking that maybe
meeting somebody one-on-one...

...is too intense...

...so Friday night,
my friends are having a party.

<i>-A party?</i>
-A little one.

It's a farewell for Leonard,
so all the attention will be on him.

If you wear something brown and sit on the
couch, they won't even know you're there.

<i>-I'm not sure.</i>
-Please.

<i>-Raj.</i>
-Come on, don't make me beg.

And I'm from lndia, so I know how to do it.

<i>Okay.</i>

Yeah, thank you. This means a lot to me.

My friends are like my family.

Unless you don't like them,
in which case, they're dead to me.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO]

-You ever spent a long time in a boat before?
-Yeah.

Are you referring to the time we got stuck
on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

[SADLY]
Yeah.

I'm proud of you, Leonard.

Working out on the North Sea for months?
That's really something.

[lN NORMAL VOICE]
I know.

As far as science goes,
this is the adventure of a lifetime.

Ha, ha. Maybe your lifetime, l went to space.

It's not a competition.

You're right, you're right.

I'm really proud of you,
and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

And space beats water.

Rajesh, l thought Lucy was coming.

She is. She's just running a little late.

You know how it is, girls, always fussing
about their hair, their makeup, she'll be here.

Just give it a rest, okay?

[TURNS OFF STEREO]

Can l have your attention, everyone?

[CLlNKlNG]

That's B-flat for those
who don't have perfect pitch.

I would like to propose a toast
to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

He has been presented
with a wonderful opportunity...

...and I couldn't be happier for him.

Thank you, Sheldon,
that must have been hard for you to say.

Well, I mean it. l'm really happy for you.

And that's how you get
a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

Cheers.

That's really nice of you
to try to be happy for Leonard.

-Thank you.
-It must've killed you when I went to space.

-Oh, no.
-Buddy, you okay?

Oh, man.

What's going on?

Go ahead, read it.

"Raj, l can't come to the party.
This is all just too much for me.

I don't think we should
see each other anymore. Sorry. Lucy."

Excuse me.

Raj, l'm so sorry.

AMY:
Me too.

[DOOR SHUTS]

It did not kill me when you went to space.

Monkeys went to space.

[PENNY SIGHS]

Well, here we are.

Yep.

I'm really gonna miss you.

I'm gonna miss you too.

Penny, we're in the red zone.

The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

We're breaking the law.

-There's no space in the white zone, so....
LEONARD: Anyway...

...we can e-mail and I think
the phone connections are good.

You have to get out of the car now.
I'm not going to jail.

-Would you just relax?
-Oh, I see a space in the white zone.

Quick, circle the airport.

-Did you bring enough inhalers?
-Yeah.

And extra Dramamine? You remember
what happened on It's a Small World.

-I'm covered.
PENNY: Okay.

Dear Lord, a police officer
is glancing in our direction.

We've been made.

Calm down, l'm getting out.

-I have something I want to give you.
-Oh, Leonard.

It's a locket with Leonard's face in it.

He got it at the mall on clearance.
Move, move, move!

I love you.

I love you too.

Don't worry, officer, they just love
each other, we're not smuggling drugs.

Raj? It's Penny, are you in there?

Hang on.

Hey. I'm coming back from the airport.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

That's very nice of you.
Come, come. Come on in.

I can't stay long. l left Sheldon in the car
with the window cracked open.

He's gonna go through that
activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so....

Are you okay?

No.

I'm so sorry.

It's my fault.

I finally found someone who's right for me
and I drove her away.

Raj.

Penny...

...I miss her already.

I know how you feel. l miss Leonard too.

What's--?

What is wrong with me?
Why can't l ever have love?

-You will.
-No, I won't, l'm unlovable.

That's just the booze talking.

No, it's not.
I haven't had a drink since last night.

You're talking to me.

-I am.
-Aah!

And now l'm crying
for a whole different reason.

Me too.

So I guess what I'm saying is,
I get where Lucy's coming from.

-That's great. Do you want some wine?
-No, water is fine.

Anyhow, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.

I pushed too hard, but if l back off
and give her enough space...

...maybe there's still a future for us.

The funny thing about life
is that sometimes something you think....

[WHlSPERS]
Does he ever shut up?

RAJESH: But then it turns good again
and that means it's better...

...than if it had never been bad a while.

And now things aren't good.
They are in fact...

...very, very bad...

...but at least my heart is starting to heal.
Slowly, but surely.

How l cried, it was like a little thunderstorm
on my face.

But l'm a man, okay?
So I need to pull myself together...

...pick up a pen and get it all out
in my journal. l mean...

...it's not all bad. Having my heart broken
has allowed me to speak in front of you...

...so, you know, the silver lining.

[English - US - SDH]

(THUNDER CRASHES)

Sheldon, it's not a great time!
What do you want?

Hello to you, too.

I'm sorry,
but this is important.

What is it?

Back to the Future 2 was in the
Back to the Future 3 case,

and Back to the Future 3
was, get this,

in the Back to the Future 2 case.

So?

So, did you do that,
or am I in the house with an intruder?

Sheldon, I got to go inside.
It's getting rough out here.

You're dodging the question.
I knew it was you.

(LOUD ROARING)

- What was that?
- What was what?

This isn't a very good connection,

but it sounded like someone
just released a Kraken.

Okay, I'm hanging up now.

You know there's
no such thing as a...

(SCREAMING)
(ROARING)

No!

Penny! Penny! Penny!

What's the matter?

Um...

Well, I was worried
that you might be missing Leonard.

And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

like the kind you'd get if you
watched Clash of the Titans

right before you went to bed.

Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?

- To be honest, I did.
- Aw.

Back to the Future 2 was in the
Back to the Future 3 case.

Leonard did it.

- Good night.
- No, wait.

Perhaps I should sleep here,
so you don't miss Leonard as much,

'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

You know what?
That would make me feel better.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Good night.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYING) âª

I think you'd be pleased to hear that
this morning in the parking garage,

I saw this oil stain on the ground
that was shaped just like

my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,
and I didn't get upset at all.

I'm proud of you.

Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

Although you may have earthly woes,
get your mind back on the stars.

Gee, even the lowly dung beetle
chooses to plot its course

- by using the Milky Way.
- Is that true?

Everything I say is true.

Now, of course,
the dung beetle also enjoys

eating feces, living in feces
and making little balls out of feces.

So, you know, pick and choose
which aspects of its lifestyle

you want to embrace.

Come on, you can talk to girls now.

It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

How can I meet someone new when
everywhere I look, I see Lucy's face?

Tell me you don't see her smile
in the crust of this chicken pot pie.

Would you stop it!

Now, listen to me.

There's a welcome party
for incoming post-docs tonight.

Go to it and meet someone
who isn't made of grease or pie.

You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy.

- I'll go with you.
- You would do that for me?

Of course. You're my friend.
I want you to be happy.

Thanks.

Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

I want you to be happy, too,

but not enough
to do anything about it.

Howie, stop. I can't talk like that.
Amy's right here.

Sheldon, stop. For the last time,
I will not bring home bed bugs.

The hotel's nice.
There's a pool, a gym,

the bar looks like fun.

Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

I love you, too. If I don't talk
to you before you go to sleep,

- I'll meet you in dreamland.
- AMY: Good night.

No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

No.

Well, now that
I've piqued your interest,

welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

Why don't you just admit
you only want to play this game

because you always play it
with Leonard and you miss him?

You overestimate
his significance in my life.

Hm...

Do I miss how he makes a face
on my toaster waffle with syrup?

No.

Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper
on my jacket when it gets stuck?

I don't think so.

Do I miss how we say good night
to each other

through the walls of our bedroom
using Morse Code?

Okay, I get it, I get it.
You are an emotionless robot.

Well, I try.

All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

- Great. I'll go first.
- Okay.

By the way, how are you with zippers?

- Why?
- Well, I really need

to go to the bathroom,
and this one's gone all cattywampus.

Wow, your work on jellyfish
neural nets sounds so interesting.

It is. You can download my paper
off the university server.

I will. You can download my paper
on the Van Allen Belts

- from the university server as well.
- I will.

All right.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

How'd it go?

Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

interspersed with painful moments
of silence, it was bananas.

Check it out. Mrs. Davis
from Human Resources is here.

She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

Oh, great. There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.

Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.

You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

- on infidelity among penguins.
- Okay.

So if the fact
that your husband left you

makes you feel unattractive, just
remember, penguins get cheated on,

and they're adorable.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

I was thinking of going
to the lecture

on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.

Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

To the advancement of science.

And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

This is fun. We never really get
to talk shop with Penny around.

We usually just end up
talking about boys.

Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

with a little
intellectual conversation.

From the two gentlemen at the bar.

Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks!
Boys bought us drinks!

(SQUEALS)

Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

- Be cool.
- You be cool!

Guys are hitting on us,
and not just to get to Penny.

You're right. Thank you!

- Oh! Bad move.
- Really? Why?

My queen can now
take your rook from below.

So that means I lose, right?
It's over!

If I make this move...

But I won't because
we're having too much fun.

- Okay, let's take a break.
- We're all out of alcohol.

I wasn't going to get alcohol.

(GROANS)

Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing
right now. I miss him so much.

Well, if you'd like,
we could call him.

I mean that you could call him.

As I've explained, the absence
of my friends does not cause me pain.

As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon
once said,

"I am a rock. I am an iiiisland."

- I'm calling him.
- Oh, goodie! Put him on speakerphone!

âª (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) âª

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Excuse me, ladies,
but my pants are buzzing.

North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

- Leonard?
- Penny?

Hey, it's Penny.
Everybody say "Hi" to Penny.

ALL: Hi, Penny!

Ha! Sounds like you're
having a good time.

Best time of my life!

- Isn't it 5:30 in the morning there?
- Is it?

Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

(CHEERING)

Okay, well, we were just calling you
because we were missing you.

- Iceberg!
- Oh! Hang on.

- Are you in danger?
- No, it's a drinking game.

Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

ALL (CHANTING): Berg! Berg!
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!

Leonard? Leonard?
(SCOFFS)

I cannot believe we
were missing that jerk.

You were.

So what happened?
How'd it go?

It's fine. I thanked them again and
let them know we're not available.

So I can drink this without having
to give up the goodies?

Yes, it's all cool.

Although, if you wanted to talk to
one of them, no one would blame you.

And why would no one blame me?

I don't know what I'm saying.

Well, it sounds like you're saying
that I could do better than Sheldon.

Boy, these drinks are strong!

Oh, Mama, I'm gonna be
hugging the toilet tonight!

No, tell me. I want to know
what you meant by that.

I just meant that you're not married,

and your boyfriend's
kind of... Sheldon.

And your husband is extremely Howard.
What's your point?

Sorry, I have no point.
That was a stupid thing to say.

Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

and I remember that rotten thing
you just said about my sweet baboo.

Come on, I apologize.
Can we please just let it go?

- Sure.
- Thanks.

Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

I can't believe it! All this time
I've been doing nothing

but sit around and miss that guy.
And you know what the worst part is?

That you're having to process
your emotional pain without vodka?

No.

Yeah.

But you know what
the second-worst part is?

- He does not miss me at all.
- Allow me to comfort you.

At least you've got your health.

Really? That's it?
That's comforting?

Um...

In a hundred years, you'll both
be dead and it won't matter?

No! Come on! You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

The only reason he's partying
is to cover up his pain."

Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

This is ridiculous.

Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

Well, perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

Is that it?
Did I get it right?

Okay, that's great. You can stop
trying to make me feel better now.

Actually, I can't.

Before Leonard left, he made me
promise that I'd take care of you.

- He did?
- Yes.

Oh! That's really sweet.

Plus, if I do a good job, he said
he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.

Well, now I miss him even more.

Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

- Thanks.
- Oh! Seriously?

- Excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
- What?

I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

because 99 percent of them
are stand-up guys.

Forget about it.

You know, you and I...
you and I have a lot in common.

- Is that right?
- Oh, yes. I...

I, too,
am in the throes of heartbreak.

Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

It's in a to-go cup.
Make of that what you will.

Come on. It's still early.
Let's do something.

Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4D chess.

- How about we just talk?
- All right.

- In 4D chess...
- No.

Come on, let's talk about our lives.

Tell me something
about you I don't know.

I own nine pairs of pants.

Okay, that's a good start,

but I was thinking maybe something
a little more personal.

- I see.
- Hm.

I own nine pairs of underpants.

How about I go first?

But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

Although, based on the floor of your
bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.

Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

When I first moved out to LA,

I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

about a killer gorilla.

After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

Thankfully,
that thing never came out.

I've seen that.

- Yeah. Serial Apeist.
- (GASPS)

Howard found it online
the day we met you.

- Oh, God.
- I mean, it was literally

the moment you walked out the door.

But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

Okay.

(CHUCKLES)

A while back,
YouTube changed its user interface

from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

- That's your big revelation?
- Yes.

Whoo! I feel ten pounds lighter.

Okay, you know what?
I give up. I'm going to bed.

Here's something else
you don't know about me:

- you just hurt my feelings.
- What did I do?

I opened up and shared something
deeply upsetting to me,

and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

- I didn't think it was a big deal.
- It is to me, that's the point.

Sheldon, you are right.
I'm really sorry.

- I should've known better.
- Your apology is accepted.

Thank you. How about a hug?

- How about a hearty handshake?
- Come on.

Now I know how you felt getting
mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.

- Good night.
- Mm-hm.

It was rather flattering
to have strangers send us drinks.

Yeah, that felt nice.

Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

So, hypothetically, if we
were to have gone with them,

which one would you have picked?

I think I would have gone with the
short one with the goofy haircut.

Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

like I'd have
to teach him a thing or two.

(GROWLS SOFTLY)

Not my guy.
I caught him staring at my rack.

It'd be nice to be with a man

who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

FYI, it's another cardigan.

Your short, sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

Your brainy virgin
kind of sounds like Sheldon.

- Good night.
- Night.

All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

but I need to go home
and relieve my babysitter.

I can relate to being
a single parent. I have a dog.

Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.
Good night.

Mrs. Davis...

I, uh... I must confess,
I came here tonight

in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely post-doc,

but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

That's a much better evening.

You're a lovely person.

- Are you hitting on me?
- No, no, no, that would be crazy!

I mean, if I were hitting on you,
you'd know it

'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

You're sweet.

- Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
- Good night.

Looks like she accepted your apology.

And then some.
I think we had a moment.

Please, you did not
have a moment.

Who died and made you
king of moments?

Okay, fine.
Let's say there was a moment.

- There was.
- There wasn't. But...

But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

I will slowly seduce her
until she falls helpless into my bed,

hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

- So nothing.
- No, not a thing.

(SIGHS)

I'm so glad the police
finally caught

that psychotic
genetically-engineered ape.

That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

ALL (CHANTING): Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!

(SCREAMS)

(English US - SDH)

And here's another
interesting weather fact.

Another? Great!

Changes in jet streams
can affect the speed

at which the Earth
rotates on its axis,

so bad weather can actually
make the day longer.

Well, there must be a hell
of a storm somewhere.

Joke if you must, but you're
going to miss these moments.

With Leonard home in a few days,

this was your last time
driving me to the grocery store.

You know, I will miss this.

I'll tell you what,
if my apples are mealy,

we'll hit the produce section
for one last crazy blowout.

Heck, you can even push the cart.

Please don't take my looking
forward to Leonard's return

as criticism of the job you've
been doing in his absence.

I won't.

That criticism will come later
in your report card.

Yeah, I didn't stay
for the detention,

I'm not gonna read
the report card.

- Hello.
- (SCREAMS) Leonard! Hi!

- Sh! Keep your voice down.
- Oh, my God. You weren't supposed

- to be here till Sunday!
- We finished the experiment early,

so I thought I'd come home
and surprise you.

Oh, my gosh,
why are we whispering?

I didn't tell Sheldon
so we could have a few days alone.

- Oh! That is so romantic.
- Sure, that's why I did it.

I just cannot believe you're here.

SHELDON: Penny, it's your lucky day!

Three of the eggs are clearly
not jumbo. Grab your keys.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYING) âª

Stuart, I was wondering
if you could help me find something.

Happy to, unless it's hope
or a reason to live.

Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.

Anyhoo, Leonard will be back
in a couple days

and I need a welcome-home
gift for him.

As he's been at sea,
perhaps something

with a nautical theme
might be appropriate.

Okay, well, I don't know
how much you want to spend,

but I do have this pretty
cool Aquaman statue.

Aquaman?
This isn't a gag gift, Stuart.

Yeah, just as well.
It's a pretty rare piece.

I'd rather just sell it
to a real collector.

I'm a real collector.

How rare is it?

I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
How about a Batman squirt gun?

Ye...

Don't try and trick me
into buying something I don't want.

Now, let's talk Aquaman.

What were they thinking,
putting Doctor Octopus's mind

in Spider-Man's body?

Well, I've been quite enjoying that.

It combines all the
superhero fun of Spider-Man

with all the body-switching
shenanigans of Freaky Friday.

Both versions: original and Lohan.

(INDIAN ACCENT) "Both versions:
original and Lohan." You're an idiot.

Hey, what's your problem?

I'm sorry.
I've been kind of snippy lately.

It's probably this stupid diet
I'm on.

- Why are you on a diet?
- I've put on a couple pounds.

Had to buy these pants
in the men's section.

Well, we've all seen your mom.

That Butterball turkey
was bound to come home to roost.

Twelve-hundred dollars!
That's my final offer!

All right, Sheldon, you win.

I'm sure Leonard
is gonna love this.

Oh, right, a present for Leonard.

You better throw in that squirt gun.

Hm... Yeah, I don't know.
This squirt gun, it's... it's pretty rare.

Oh!

And this is me doing
the Titanic pose on the boat.

Oh!

And... oh, that's me getting rescued
after I fell in.

Oh.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

- Oh. That's the pizza.
- Yep.

- Here's some money.
- Thank you.

And I'm gonna hit the head.

That's what us salty sea dogs say
when we have to go pee-pee.

- Hey.
- Twenty-two, fifty.

Okay, here's 25.
Keep the change.

Seriously? I just walked up,
like, four flights of stairs.

Oh, okay. Well, here's, um...

Thirty-something cents,

and a promise
I won't call your boss

and tell him
you reek of marijuana.

Oh, Penny, I see
you've ordered pizza.

- I have Chinese food.
- That's nice.

Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne.

My uncle used to wear that.

Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal
together before Leonard returns.

Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel
like eating alone tonight, so...

Are you sure? With your Italian pizza
and my Chinese noodles,

we could play Marco Polo.

I mean, of course,
a reenactment of a meal

in the life of Marco Polo
the Venetian explorer,

not Marco Polo
the terrifying water sport.

Uh, yeah. It sounds fun,
but no thanks.

(TOILET FLUSHES)
Have a good night!

- What, now, do you have company?
- No. No, no, no.

You know what?
The toilet's been doing that.

- I called the building manager, so...
- Oh, I can take a look at it.

- Well...
- I'm quite familiar with plumbing.

Not to brag, but I spent most of
fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

Yeah, no, no, no.
You know what, Sheldon, it's okay.

You don't have to go
into the bathroom.

That's curious.
If there's no one here,

why are there two glasses
of wine on the table?

Oh. Well, you know,
I've got two hands

and a bit of a drinking problem.

Of course.
Ask a silly question.

- That's odd.
- What?

There are takeout containers
in the trash can.

So? That's my dinner from last night.

What's odd is they're
in the trash can.

Okay. Look, honey,
I promise there's no one's here.

I've had a long day. I just want
to have a quiet dinner by myself.

Oh, very well.

I'm no stranger to enjoying
the pleasures of solitude.

- Oh!
- What?

Have you gotten Leonard
a welcome-home gift yet?

- No.
- Oh, great.

Do you want to go halfsies
on a 200 dollar squirt gun?

- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

I made some brownies.
You want one?

You're kidding, right?

I mean, you know
I'm trying to lose weight.

God, I thought we were partners
in this marriage.

We are. Stop it. And for the
last time, you're not fat.

Really? Tell that
to the bathroom scale,

'cause one of you is lying.

Fine, forget I asked.
How was dinner at your mom's?

Awful. I had to rub her ointment
all over her again.

Why can't she do it?

'Cause we've got a deeply
unhealthy relationship.

Which reminds me,

do you think you can get
any samples of this from work?

This was supposed
to last her a month,

but they didn't take into account
the square footage of her back.

Let me see.

How long have you been
putting this on her?

I don't know.
Few weeks. Why?

This is really strong estrogen cream.

Please tell me
you've been wearing gloves.

Like these swollen sausages
could fit in gloves.

Howie, the estrogen's
getting absorbed by your skin.

That's why you've been
all bloated and moody

and a giant pain in the ass.

You're full of estrogen
and you don't act like that.

That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had
years of practice riding the dragon.

Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.

It's still gonna take a few weeks for
the hormones to leave your system.

I feel so stupid. And fat.

It's okay.
You still look great to me.

In fact, why don't we go in the
bedroom and I'll prove it to you?

Sex? Really? I mean,
that's just your solution to everything!

Oh, and here's a fun thing.

I worked it out so that there are
two different words for spoon:

"planko" and "janko."

"Planko" is a spoon with food,
"janko" is a spoon without food.

"Janko" is spelled
with a silent "ptang."

Sheldon, you're not even listening
to the rules of my made-up language.

- Yes, I am.
- Then what does "tweepadock" mean?

Uh...

Elephant?

Lucky guess.

I'm sorry.

I'm just distracted by something
that happened over at Penny's.

What happened?

I fear Penny is being unfaithful
to Leonard.

- What?
- She claimed to be alone

when there was obviously
someone else in her apartment.

I have no choice but
to assume the worst,

given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage

and her famously
ravenous nether regions.

I don't think Penny
would cheat on Leonard.

Oh, really?
(LAUGHS)

She and I once had
a staring contest.

She clapped really loud
and made me blink.

It's a small leap from there
to sexual infidelity.

You're being ridiculous.

Amy, there were Chinese
food containers... in the trash can.

Poor Leonard.

- Do you hear anything?
- I hear a woman's voice.

- Is it Penny?
- No, it's you.

All right,
I hear whispering and giggling.

Now I think I hear kissing.

Yeah, like you know
what kissing sounds like.

There's kissing in Star Trek,
smarty-pants.

Let me listen.

- Sounds like Leonard.
- Please.

Why would Leonard come home early
and waste his time kissing Penny

when he could be hanging out
with his best buddy?

Yeah, that's it.
I'm catching her in the act.

No, Sheldon, don't.

A-ha!

- What the hell?!
- Leonard?

Sheldon, you cannot just
barge in here like that!

Right.

(KNOCKING LOUDLY)

SHELDON: Penny! Penny! Penny!

Are you going to answer the door
or should I open it

and say "a-ha" again?

I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I should've told you I was back.

I just wanted to have
a couple days alone with Penny.

Oh, no, I should apologize.

I never realized to what extent
our friendship was a burden to you.

That is not fair.

I complain about what a burden it is
at least once a month.

Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this.

You find me finicky,
pedantic and annoying.

No, he doesn't.

I actually have used
those exact words before.

In that order.

Well, Leonard,
I think it's high time

you and I address
the "tweepadock" in the room.

- The what?
- Amy?

- Please leave me out of this.
- Fine.

Leonard, there's no need for you
to pretend to like me anymore.

- Come on, I said I was sorry.
- No, no, you save your apologies

for after you've had
disappointing coitus with Penny.

It was fine.

Come on, this is silly.

Hey, I brought you back
a little present from my trip, huh?

It's that sailor cap that you wanted.
It's neat, huh?

You honestly think you can buy back
my friendship with a cheap souvenir?

I don't. No, I really don't.
Just try it on.

- Oh, yeah.
- Hello, sailor.

Now we're talking.

Excuse me.

This changes nothing.

Except the Halloween costume
I'm wearing this year.

Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl.
Lay off the donuts.

- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

Ooh! You made little sandwiches!

Yeah, that's cucumber
and cream cheese.

That's turkey and loganberry.

And don't tell my hips, but I'm
warming up a brie in the oven.

Nice. So...

What's up?

Okay, well, I've been reading up
on all the side effects

you can get from estrogen, and...
I need you to be honest with me.

Do my boobs look bigger to you?

Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

Come on, Raj,
it's a "yes or no" question.

I'm not sure. Um... Wait.

Jump up and down,
let's see if they jiggle.

No, I... I still can't tell. Uh...

Oh, you know what?
Okay, give me some of this.

- Seriously?
- Do you want my help or not?

Fine.

Okay, yup.

See, see, that looks like...
that looks like they could be bigger.

But, you know, I bet... I bet when
I do it, mine do the same thing.

- Yeah, they kind of do.
- Hm... Let me see something.

Hey, easy!

- My nipples are sensitive.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.

(EXHALES)

Okay.

I mean...

Yeah, maybe.

Okay, let me feel.

No, I am definitely up a cup size.

You know, but they're very firm,
so you've got that going for you.

- You think?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.

Thank you.
I really needed to hear that today.

(OVEN DINGS)

- Ooh! Brie's ready!
- Yay!

- Good morning.
- Hello.

So am I driving you to work,
or are you still mad at me?

I'd like a ride.

Assuming you actually do
take me to work.

Where do you think I would take you?

Who knows? You said
you'd be home yesterday,

but you came home three days ago.

You say you're taking me
to work, but for all I know,

I'll end up
in a deserted amusement park.

Or a cornfield maze.

Or a back-alley dog fight.
You tell me.

I'm going to work.
You can come if you want.

Okay.

By the way, you have
something on your shirt.

- No, I don't.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

You know, I find myself wondering

if anything you've
ever told me is true.

I didn't make it back.
The ship sank, I'm in hell.

You say you're from New Jersey,
but how can I believe you?

Why would anyone claim to be
from New Jersey if they weren't?

All right, I'll give you that one.

Hey, I said I was sorry.
What else do you want from me?

I want you to admit that
what you did was wrong.

Fine. What I did was wrong.

I wish I could believe you.

You know what?
I'm not driving you to work,

because you're incredibly annoying.

You say one thing and do the other,

so then you are driving me
and you find me a delight.

- Stop it.
- Keep it up?

- Bye!
- Hello!

So I guess you're really
holding up the other four fingers?

Oh, hey, what are you
doing here so early?

- Driving Sheldon to work.
- He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

He's mad at you, too.

He says you're the succubus
who led his friend astray.

I don't know
what "succubus" is, but...

it has "suck" in it,
so that can't be good.

- Thought I heard you out here.
- Hey, Sheldon.

You don't get a "hey."
You get a "hmm."

Come on, don't be like that.

We had so much fun together
the last couple of months.

You're right. Which makes your
betrayal all the more devastating.

- Sheldon...
- I let you buy

feminine hygiene products
with my supermarket club card.

You have any idea the kind of coupons
I'm going to get in the mail now?

Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard.
Penny's got nothing to do...

Careful, Amy.

The friend of my enemy's girlfriend
is my enemy.

- Really?
- Yes.

You're either with me or against me.

You want to take the bus to work?

Maybe there's a third option.

FYI, I had a doughnut
for breakfast, you jerk.

So now we're just waiting
for the data

from the ship to be crunched, but the
numbers look pretty promising.

That's so great. If you guys prove
the existence of Unruh radiation...

Hey, hey, hey!
My eyes are up here.

Howard, Raj, Judas.

You know what?
You're a crazy person.

A crazy person with a long memory,

and if all goes according to plan,
a robot army.

- Stop it.
- Or a mutant army.

It depends on how
my Kickstarter goes.

I said stop it!

Now, listen to me.

You two aren't just friends.

You're best friends.

And that's a beautiful thing.

I mean, Leonard, you know
why he's so mad at you?

It's 'cause he missed you!

Yeah, and as his friend,
you should be happy

he has love in his life.

As I do.

This man held my breast
the other day, and I love him for it.

A little loud, dude.

So can we please put aside
these petty differences

and just be glad
we're here together?

- Okay.
- I suppose so.

Thank you.

It wasn't anything weird.
It was just to see how big they were.

And then Leonard took me
to the barber and the dentist,

and then to cap off the perfect day,

the Los Angeles Bureau
of Weights and Measures.

I thought the measures were
going to be the stars of the show.

Turns out it was the weights.

I'm so glad you guys
are friends again.

And I'm glad you and I
are friends again, too.

Which reminds me. This came in the
mail, and I want you to have it.

"Fifty cents off Vagisil."

Think of me when you apply it.

Can I just say, I've missed
all of us hanging out together.

- Yeah.
- Me, too.

Um, since when can Koothrappali talk
in front of the girls without a beer?

Oh, that happened
right after you left.

And no one told me?

Can't believe we forgot to tell him.

Ahem. Think of Sheldon
when you apply it.

(English - US SDH)

So... couldn't help
but notice none of you RSVP'd

to my murder mystery dinner party.

Oh, yeah.
We were meaning to do that.

No, you weren't, because it
was a week ago and nobody came!

So if you want to solve the mystery
of who stabbed Koothrappali

in the back with the weapon of
indifference, it was all of you.

I don't think that qualifies
as a mystery.

We all knew what we were doing.

- We're sorry, Rajesh.
- Maybe we can do it next week.

(LAUGHS)
Whoa, we're not that sorry.

Don't worry, I can take a hint.
No more murder mystery parties.

- Thank you.
- Hallelujah.

Because I've got something
even better planned!

- Come on!
- Just hear me out.

I'm going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt

like they have at MIT.

Oh, I loved those.
I did them every year there.

- We did them at Princeton, too.
- Oh, that's cute.

Like it's a real college.

That's amusing. I was going
to say that about MIT,

but it works for Princeton, too.

Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.

I always got stuck
on the first challenge.

Trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.

(LAUGHS)

I guess that story's
more sad than funny.

I love scavenger hunts. My friends
and I had them all the time.

Oh, these are a little different.

There's a tradition
at elite universities.

And Princeton.

A tradition of hunts full of puzzles
that rely on logic,

obscure knowledge, science.

Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store

that would sell us beer.

- So, who's in?
- I think it sounds fun.

- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm in.

- Let's do it.
- I'm sorry.

Are we really doing this
or are we tricking Koothrappali again

like with the dinner party?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYING) âª

What's all this?

Oh, everything I could possibly need
to win the scavenger hunt.

You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?

Well, if he does, do you know how
filthy those rental balls are?

They might as well
stand on the corner

and give away free rectal exams.

(AMPLIFIED BANGING) Ahem.

Okay, everybody.

Who's ready for a...

Oh!

...scavenger hunt?
(ECHOING)

âª (ELECTRONIC DANCE
MUSIC PLAYING) âª

(MUSIC STOPS)

Somewhere... in the city of Pasadena,

I've hidden a golden coin! (ECHOING)

You will be faced with a total
of ten puzzles! (ECHOING)

Each... (COUGHS)

Each... each puzzle will lead you

to the location of the next,

the last of which
will lead you to the coin. (ECHOING)

The first team that finds it... wins!

He is a born showman.

Any questions? (ECHOING)

Yes, to be fair, do people who went
to Princeton get a head start?

That's not funny.

Oh, it actually is,
if you get the joke.

It's based on the premise that
Princeton isn't a very good school.

Ha-ha.

Oh, see? Now, he gets it.

Okay, guys, go ahead and divide
yourselves into teams of two.

- Should we just do couples?
- Couples sounds great.

Or we could mix things up.
Maybe pick names out of a hat, whatever.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Why don't you just admit you don't
want to be on a team with me.

I just said, "Couples sound great."

Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.

You think I'm gonna be a liability.

Even though I totally just used
the word "liability" correctly

in a sentence.

Yeah.

No, let's do couples. I want to.

No, no, no. Let's mix things up.

I choose Sheldon,
and we're gonna kick your ass!

Yeah... really?

The only time I'm ever
picked first for a team

and I'm stuck with the liability?

Stop that.
Penny is not a liability.

Thank you.
Do you want to be on my team?

Maybe we pick names out of a hat.

Hurry up and close the door
so they can't hear us.

Would you stop pouting?
So, you picked my name. Get over it.

Yes, and do you know what
the odds are I'd pick your name?

- No.
- It's not hard: one in five.

Now you know why I'm pouting.

RAJ (OVER RADIO): All right, teams.
Get ready to open your first puzzle.

Go!

Do you see what I did?
The first puzzle is a puzzle!

Oh, my God, how adorable is that?

I wish I had a friend like me.

What are you doing?
You have to start with the edges.

There's no right way, Sheldon.
I already found a few pieces that fit.

Yeah, well, take them apart
and start with the edges.

And stop wasting time.

Wow, you're really good at puzzles.

I did them all the time as a kid.

As my mom used to say,
"When you're doing a puzzle,

it's like having a thousand friends."

She was full
of fun lies like that.

If it makes you feel any better,
my mom's just full of pound cake.

I'm sorry you got stuck with me.

I bet you wanted
to be with Bernadette.

Have you ever played
a game with Bernadette?

- No.
- Have you ever gone

into a steel cage with a wolverine?

(YELLING) Faster, faster, faster!
Do you not know that word?

- It means "more fast"!
- Stop yelling at me.

Hey! You'll know
when I'm yelling at you.

Oh. Oh, it's the comic book store!
All right, come on.

That's where we have to go.

But we haven't finished the puzzle.

Well, it doesn't matter!
We know the answer!

You think you know the answer.
But it could be a trick.

What if when the puzzle's complete,

there's a sign
in the window that says,

"Go to the train store"?

Okay, it's not gonna say that.

Well, I hope you're wrong.
I really want to go to the train store.

It's the comic book store. Let's go!

Come on, numb nuts,
it's the comic book store!

It's the comic book store,
it's the comic book store,

it's the comic book store!

(GROANS)

- It's the comic book store.
- Oh!

- Do you think Penny's mad at me?
- Because you're in the right lane

behind a bus and won't go around it?
I'm sure she finds it charming.

No, because I didn't
want her on my team.

I'm starting to think
she dodged a bullet.

The slowest bullet in the world.

I never realized
you were so competitive.

Yeah, I know.

It's probably because I grew up
with five brothers and sisters

so I had to fight for every...

Oh, my God, you did not
just slow down for a bird!

You know they fly, right?!

I think this is
the first time we've ever

actually been alone together.

Huh, I guess you're right.
Wonder why that is.

Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say we don't have a lot

in common except for the people
we're involved with.

Plus, when we first met,
Penny warned me never

to get into a car alone with you.

Yeah.

You know, I bet you and I have
more in common than we think.

- Such as?
- I don't know.

- Tell me some things you like.
- Uh, let's see.

I like harps,
Little House on the Prairie,

medieval poetry,
medieval literature...

Hey, how about some music?

Great. Sheldon never lets me
listen to music in the car.

He doesn't want to be mistaken
for a gang member.

Find something you like.

Beatles, boring.

Eminem, scary.

Weird Al? How old are you?

- Neil Diamond?
- Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.

I love Neil Diamond.

âª (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"SWEET CAROLINE") âª

Oh, hey, thanks for letting me
use the comic book store

- as part of the scavenger hunt.
- Oh, my pleasure.

Always happy to help out
with fun things

that I wasn't invited
to be a part of.

Oh, congratulations.
You're the first team to arrive.

Yes! It's not a ruse
to make fun of me!

It's a real game and I'm winning it!

Your next puzzle is a riddle.

And who better to give it to you
than The Riddler?

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

How am I faster than you?

I'm in heels and I stopped
to take a phone call.

I have asthma. Back off!

"Riddle me this.
Arrah, Arrah, and gather round,

the work of this hero
is legion-bound.

He multiplies N
by the number of He,

and in this room
the thing you'll see."

- Good riddle, huh?
- Yeah.

So when you guys plan fun activities,
does my name even...

come up, or...?

I invited you to my
murder mystery party.

- No, you didn't.
- Oh.

(GROANS) We're the last ones here,
hurry up!

- It is a marathon, not a sprint.
- People run in a marathon!

Not with a bowling ball
on their back.

Hey, Penny, I just
wanted to say good luck,

and I hope there's no hard feelings.

Hey, Romeo! Repair your relationship
on your own time!

Relax, it's a hard puzzle.
It's gonna take a while to solve.

- "Riddle me this..."
- Got it.

Hey, Princeton, look at that,

Team Community College Night School
is in the lead.

I thought we were
the Lightning Sharks!

Hey, you know what this could mean...

Oh, oh, that's good.
Then this would be...

- That's it.
- To the Neil Mobile!

I knew it, we're gonna lose!

Wait, I got it. I got it!

Congratulations, you got it last.

You're really mean, you know that?

So no one's gonna buy anything.

A-ha! Okay...

Let's see.

"To continue on your quest,
leave no stone unturned."

The next clue must be hidden
under one of these rocks.

Okay.

Sheldon, I've got to ask.

How did you figure out
that it was the geology lab?

Oh, simple.

The Arrah Arrah in the riddle
meant Jan Arrah,

a member of the Legion of
Superheroes known as Element Lad.

And then the word "He,"
it wasn't the masculine pronoun,

but rather, "H-E,"
the abbreviation for helium.

See where I'm going with this?

- Yes.
- Nice try.

Now, Element Lad's ability

is the power to transmute
chemical elements.

Helium has an atomic number of two.

If you multiply that by the
atomic number of "N," nitrogen,

you get 14, which is
the atomic number of...?

I'm just funnin' you, silicon.
And that is the most common element

in the Earth's surface.
So that narrowed it down

to the geology lab
or the chemistry lab.

Wow.

I can drink a beer underwater.

And I'm sure your parents are proud.

Now, finally, the line
"in this room the thing you'll see"

was an obvious reference
to Fantastic Four member The Thing,

- who's made entirely of...
- Shut up. I solved it!

(GASPS)

Those are map coordinates.

Got 'em. Let's go.

Wait. Don't you want to know
how I figured it out?

No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.

âª (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"AMERICA") âª

Um...

I'm okay with you driving my car,
I'm not okay with you flying my car.

Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop.
He can fix things.

Uh-huh. Like death?

Your kid may be an honor student,
but you're a moron!

Penny's not answering my texts.

Who cares?
Focus on the game.

This stupid game is why
she's mad in the first place.

- I'm telling her I'm quitting.
- No!

Quitting would be the worst thing
for your relationship.

Why?

Because it would make you seem like
something she already thinks you are.

- What does she think I am?
- How do I put this?

She's been known to call you a name
that usually applies to a lady part.

Or a cat.

Or a willow.

I can't believe
she would say that about me.

If you're gonna cry about it,
there's tissues in my purse.

Unless you got some in yours.
Big willow.

âª (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"AMERICA") âª

Okay... another 30 feet.

Okay.

Oh. It's a bowling alley.

Yes. Yes!

(YELLING)
My brain is better than everybody's!

âª (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"LOVE ON THE ROCKS") âª

Call me a lady part.
We'll see about that.

- Can you reach the clue?
- Almost.

Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right
behind us in the bowling alley.

- Got it!
- Great, climb back up.

Come on!

Yeah, Penny might be onto something.

- To the planetarium!
- Let's go!

- To the tar pits!
- Let's go!

There's a Neil Diamond
concert next month!

Let's go!

Three bags, no one's opened 'em.
We're the first ones here!

- It's dirty laundry. You're up.
- Why me?

Because you've been training
for this your whole life.

You live in a pile of dirty laundry.

They're here first.
This is because

you made me slow down
for that blind guy.

- Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
- The clue must be in the bag.

- It's just a bunch of pants.
- It's just a bunch of pants.

You know, I'm surprised
you want to copy my answers

since I'm not even smart
enough to be on your team.

Well, why would you want
to be on someone's team

who you like to call a... I can't
even say it in front of Sheldon.

What are you talking about?

You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

No, she doesn't.
I just made that up.

Why would you do that?

Because you were about to quit like
a big... Sheldon, cover your ears.

I'm not a child.
I know the word "ninny."

Yeah, well, you should have quit
'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.

Wish I had a man
like her on my team.

Hey, I am every bit
as much of a man as Penny.

Now, let's do this!

Wait, it's not all pants,
there's one shirt.

- Oh.
- Hey, that's my shirt.

- This one is, too.
- No, no, that's not mine.

- That has a big spot on it.
- Wait. So does this one.

Maybe the spot's the clue.

"Sheldon's spot."
The coin is in your spot!

- Oh, that's clever.
- PENNY: Hurry!

Be there in a minute.
I just have to pre-soak these!

(ALL YELLING)

Stop her, Leonard! Stop her!

(ALL YELLING)

- Where the hell's the coin?
- Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?

Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.

- Then where's the coin?
- Yes, exactly.

Where is the coin?

Why don't you look in your pockets?

I slipped them in there
earlier today.

- I don't get it.
- Don't you see?

When we're all having fun together,
we're already winners.

Oh, look. See?

Even I'm a winner.

Are you kidding me?

That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

You suck so hard.

Well, I thought...
Come on, I didn't want anyone

to feel bad at the end of the game.

And some of those puzzles
were really hard

and I didn't know
who was gonna get Penny.

Run.

Okay, okay, that came out wrong,
but you have to admit,

you all had a wonderful time.

Run to India.

I just wanted to do
something beautiful!

Hey, look. I won.

âª (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"CHERRY, CHERRY") âª

(English US - SDH)

âª (INDIANA JONES THEME PLAYS) âª

- So what did you think?
- It was good.

That's it? "Good"?

I enjoyed it.

When you told me I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"

I didn't think you meant showing me
Raiders of the Lost Ark

for the first time.

My apologies.
I chose my words poorly.

I should have said

you were about to have
your world rocked on my couch.

Anyway, thank you for watching it.

It's one of my all-time favorites.

It was very entertaining,

despite the glaring story problem.

Story problem?

Oh.

Amy...

What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is
the love child

of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

two of the most gifted filmmakers
of our generation.

I've watched it 36 times,

except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

which I can only watch
when it's still light out, but...

I defy you to find a story problem.

Here's my jaw... drop it.

All right.

Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story.

If he weren't in the film,
it would turn out exactly the same.

Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

Indiana Jones was the one in the hat
with the whip.

No, I do,
and if he weren't in the movie,

the Nazis would have still found
the ark,

taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died,

just like they did.

Let me close that for you.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

- Hey!
- Hi!

I thought you went to the comic book
store on Wednesdays.

Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

and they don't need me there
to make it awkward.

They have each other for that.

So, how was school?

Oh, good. Check it out.

The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter. Oh!

- You bought my mom's book?
- Yeah!

It's on the recommended reading list
for my psychology class.

Oh!

Come on. Not that book.

It's got, like, every horrible story
from my childhood in it.

Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

Seriously, please find another book.

Oh, come on. Why?
How bad could it be?

There's chapters
about potty training,

and bed-wetting and...

masturbation.

Basically, if something came
out of me, she wrote about it!

You know what?
Do whatever you want,

just don't talk to me about it.

Not even the chapter
on the breast-feeding crisis?

It was not a crisis.

Apparently, I favored the left one.
She got a little lopsided.

Oh, my God, you still go left!

Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

Halle Berry.

Why?

Stuart and I are putting
dating profiles online,

and it's one of the questions.

And thank you. I'd kill
for that woman's bone structure.

Why are you reading
Pride and Prejudice?

I'll tell you why.

Amy ruined
Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,

so now I'm trying to find something
beloved to her and ruin that.

Because her life wasn't enough?

Wait. How can anyone ruin
Raiders? It's perfect.

Yeah, except for the fact

that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

With or without him, the Nazis find
the ark, open it, and die.

(GRUMBLING)

Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis
were digging in the wrong place.

The only reason they got the ark
was because Indy found it first.

Actually, they were only digging
in the wrong place

because Indy had the medallion.

Without him, they would have had
the medallion and dug in the right place.

(GRUMBLING)

Okay, I know you don't
want to talk about it,

but can I just ask you one question
about your mom's book?

- No.
- I just want to know

why a five-year-old boy puts
on his mom's makeup

and wears balloon boobies.

They weren't boobies.
They were muscles.

And the makeup was green.
I was pretending to be the Hulk.

You were wearing her bra.

That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

Can we please stop talking
about this?!

Okay, okay. But you know,
as a student of psychology

who got a check-plus on her
first homework assignment...

I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

Okay, fine. Do you want to know
why I dressed like the Hulk?

Because I was always mad at my mom

and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

- Well, why were you so angry?
- Gee, I don't know.

Maybe it's because I was always
the subject of her little experiments.

Did you get to the chapter
where she staged the Easter egg hunt

with no eggs to see how long
I'd keep looking?

The answer, by the way: June.

Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

I wish there was something I could do
to make you feel better.

- I do, too, but there's not.
- Really? Are you sure about that?

Of course, who am I to argue
with a check-plus student?

Just warning you,
I'm gonna go right.

Don't make a big deal out of it.

Is makeup really necessary?

Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

the first thing they see is
your picture.

I just want to make sure
you look fun and full of life

and not like a body
they just pulled out of the river.

All right, here we go,
and... smile.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Okay. That one's in the bank.

How about this? Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

But when you do, imagine the camera
is the girl you want to meet.

You got it.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Okay... let's try it again.

But this time, pretend the girl
you want to meet

doesn't want to hurt you.

I don't think I can give you that.

Come on. One more time.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Yeah, it's...
it's a little blurry,

but I think that works in your favor.

- Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

Hey, have you finished writing
your profile yet?

Almost.

Oh, what did you put as the one-word
description of yourself?

I put "unobjectionable."

But now that I hear it out loud,
it just seems like I'm being cocky.

What did you put
for your best feature?

My parents' money.

What did you put
for your best feature?

I put "not applicable."

Come on, dude,
you're being too hard on yourself.

You've got a lot of good stuff
going on.

Really? Like what?

Well, okay, you're a talented artist.
You own your own business.

Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

Okay, well, can we imply
that you're well-endowed?

I do have one oddly long testicle.

Okay, now you're talking like
a winner!

What you doing?

Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved
Pride and Prejudice

is a flawless masterpiece.

He's got too much pride,

she's got too much prejudice...
it just works.

So you're looking to ruin something
for her in the funny pages?

Amy has a fondness
for the comic strip Marmaduke.

- And...?
- And I think I've got it.

Consider: A family possesses a dog
that is so large

and poorly disciplined,
he causes nothing but problems.

Why do they keep him?!

Maybe they fell in love with him
as a puppy

and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

Of course.

You know, why couldn't
she just like Ziggy? Yeah?

That thing's riddled with plot holes.

Sorry, buddy.

I think she's a fan of Garfield
as well.

(CHUCKLES)

Oh, darn it, now so am I.

I'll see you later. I got to go watch
a stupid football game with Penny.

Wait, hang on.
You've spent time with Amy.

Can you think of anything
she's fond of

that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

I got to go.

- You ready to go?
- Yep. Hey, and maybe this time,

you don't try and talk sports
with the guys.

Some sports bar.

It's like they never
even heard of Quidditch.

Do we really have to go?

Oh, come on. Every time we're
about to hang out with my friends,

you don't want to.

It's like, "It's too loud,"
or "The bathroom's too dirty,"

or "They put a chicken wing
in my ear." I mean...

Well, you're right.
Let's just go.

- Hey, what's going on with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

All right, hang on.
Is this still about your mom's book?

No. Not everything is about my mom.

'Cause if you're still upset
about that, we don't have to go.

Except this is totally about my mom.

I'm so sorry.
I never should have read that book.

You know what? You want to just get
dinner and watch the game here?

- That sounds nice.
- Okay.

Or, you know, we could get take-out

and watch the Blu-ray
extended version

of The Hobbit movie
with commentary track.

On account of how sad I am
about my mom.

Leonard, you ready for lunch?

One sec!

Hey. Sorry.

- Hi, Penny.
- Hi.

All right, sweetie.
You hang in there today.

I'll try, but I might be sad
again tonight.

Okay.

Wow! Sex at work?!

Leave it alone.
That's my girlfriend.

- Sorry.
- Who just had sex with me at work!

Damn.
How'd you swing that?

Whenever I talk about
how awful my mom was,

Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

- Seriously?
- Look, I mean...

I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

I got her to watch a six-part
documentary on Monty Python.

Even I was bored, I just wanted
to see if she'd make it to the end.

You sound kind of proud of it.

- I am. I'm really proud.
- Yeah.

Hello, Sheldon.
Is everything okay?

Yes. Why?

Well, the last time you made
an unscheduled video chat,

there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

and you thought someone might be
trying to slip you a mickey.

April 13...

a dark night, indeed.

So what can I do for you?

I'm calling to invite you

to a spontaneous date night
tomorrow evening.

- Really?
- Yes.

You were kind enough to watch
Raiders of the Lost Ark with me.

So I'd like to return the favor
by inviting you to watch an episode

of your favorite childhood
television series,

Little House on the Prairie.

That sounds lovely.

Why are you rubbing your hands
together?

(CLEARS THROAT)

I'm putting on lotion.
Are you in or not?

Of course I'm in.

Excellent.
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

Good night, Dr. Fowler.

Good night, Dr. Cooper.

Good night, indeed.

What a rube.

Why would I put on lotion
when I have such soft hands?

You were really quiet during dinner.
Is everything okay?

Yeah. I guess I was just thinking
about my mom,

and how sad my childhood was.

Yeah, I bet it sucked.

I'm gonna take a bath.
You do the dishes.

How about I take a bath with you
and see what happens.

Here's what's gonna happen:

I'm gonna take a bath,
and you're gonna do the dishes.

That's it?
No compassion?

Aw, poor Howie.
We good? I'm gonna take a bath.

Bernie...

God, what is going on with you?

I'm sharing my pain.

And I'm not buying it. Try again.

I'm learning to be a man in a culture

where it's increasingly difficult
to know how.

Strike two.

I'm copying Leonard.

When he does this to Penny,
they have sex and watch Monty Python.

- Howard!
- I know. It was dumb.

I shouldn't have done it.
And it's making me feel sad.

So sad.

You know, why don't you take a bath?
I'll do the dishes.

Three, two, one...

That's it.

Our dating profiles are live
on the Internet.

Attention all shoppers:
my business is open for business!

That's right, ladies.

For all you know,
I'm confident and fun to be around.

(COMPUTER CHIMES)

Oh, cool, it tells you
when someone's reading your profile.

"Jenny309."

I hope that's not her weight.

If it is, I'll... I'll take her.

(COMPUTER DINGS)

Ooh! I got one, too.

The ladies are coming to us.

Oh, man,
if I'd started this years ago,

I'd be divorced two or three times
by now.

(COMPUTER CHIMES)

What...? Another one.

You know, it's weird.

When they're reading your profile,
does it make you feel exposed?

Like they see you naked?

Well, they're not running away
screaming, so, no.

I love Little House.

It made me want to live
on a farm so much

I tried to milk my cat.

That tangy bowl of Cheerios
was not worth the stitches.

Well, you sit back, relax,

and enjoy a beloved
childhood memory.

âª (LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE
THEME PLAYS) âª

You see that cabin there?

I read they were illegally squatting
on Indian land.

Personally, I think what we did
to the Native Americans was wrong,

but this is your favorite show,
not mine.

Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,
eating that peanut butter sandwich.

Peanut butter?

Huh...

That's strange,

since peanut butter wasn't introduced
until the early 1900s.

If I knew this show was
about time travel,

I would have watched it much sooner.

(TURNS OFF TV)

You're trying to get back at me

for what I said
about Raiders of the Lost Ark.

That's silly.

Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,

since telephones only existed
in large cities at that time.

This is more like Little House
on the Preposterous.

Sheldon, we're in a relationship.

When you get angry, just tell me.

You don't need to seek revenge.

Are you sure?

Every time my dad stayed out
all night,

my mom would put hamster poop
in his chewing tobacco.

Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

Fine.

I'm mad at you.

Not only did you ruin Raiders for me,

you may have ruined
the whole franchise.

Except for the fourth one,

which was bad
before you got your mitts on it.

I shouldn't have said it.
I'm sorry.

Thank you.

- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

But not as good as I'm going
to when I tell you

that your precious Garfield has
no reason to hate Mondays.

He's a cat.
He doesn't have a job.

Hey, I was just...
What is happening?

Oh, just a little treat.

I know you've been feeling really bad
about your mom lately.

Oh, oh, I have. So bad.

And I wanted to make you feel better,

so I planned something
very special for you.

I can already feel it working.

Hello, Leonard.

Mom?!

I understand you have been whining
about my parenting

in order to emotionally manipulate
your girlfriend.

I... uh...

Bernadette told me everything.

Now you don't get the left
or the right.

Let's discuss why you continue
to involve me in your sex life.

Oh, please, Mommy.
No, Mommy.

When you were six years old,

you walked in on me
and your father naked.

I was swatting his bottom with
your brand-new Ping-Pong paddle.

I didn't dream that?

How did that make you feel?

Penny, come back!
I'm sad for real now!

In the last two hours,
162 women have read our profiles.

How many of them
have sent us messages?

- Combined?
- Yes.

Zero.

Dude, this is... this is brutal.

I don't think I've ever felt
so rejected.

And I had a rescue dog
who ran back to the pound.

This is the worst.

If we're gonna get shot down,

we might as well just go to a bar
and do it old-school.

- And make them look us in the eye.
- Yeah, anything is better than this.

- Hello.
- Not interested.

âª (POP MUSIC PLAYS) âª

I was wrong. This is worse.

âª (INDIANA JONES THEME PLAYS) âª

Wait, wait.
If it wasn't for Indiana Jones,

the ark would never have ended up
at the warehouse!

That's true!

He collected and delivered the ark
to the proper authorities for filing.

- Like a hero!
- Yes!

Although, technically,
Indy was supposed to take the ark

to a museum to be studied.
He couldn't even get that done.

(ALL GRUMBLE)

(English - US SDH)

Awkward silence.
Sheldon on his phone.

No touching.
Somebody's having date night.

It's actually steamier than it looks.

Sheldon's looking up the phallic
symbolism of root vegetables

in Renaissance paintings.

Oh, no, I got bored with that.

I'm just browsing cuticle scissors
on Amazon.

How do you not tear off his clothes
and take him here on this table?

If you do that, I'll scream.

Sheldon, I have some exciting news
to tell you.

That makes two of us.
My new cuticle scissors will be here

in one to two business days.

Come on, one.

I've been invited to consult
on an experiment

at your university for a few months.

Isn't that great?
We could have lunch together.

We could carpool.

You know, riding with Leonard
has gotten a little tedious lately.

The only car game he ever wants
to play is the Quiet Game.

And he's terrible at it.
I always win.

- So, you're okay with this?
- Well, why wouldn't I be?

Well, this project
would have us working

in close proximity to one another.

And there's the vulgar adage that one
should not defecate where one eats.

My father used to say
that all the time.

That and, "Who does one have
to orally gratify

to get a drink around here?"

But what does that have to do
with you working at the university?

Sheldon,
"Don't defecate where you eat,"

means don't have a romantic
relationship in the workplace.

Really?

Yes.

Huh...

I always took it literally.

That's why I have never once moved
my bowels in this or any restaurant.

I'm relieved that you don't have
a problem with us working together.

Not as relieved as I'm about to be.

It's a brave new world, little lady.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

Are you crazy?

You don't want
your girlfriend at work with you.

Hell Clam.

Why not?

Hairy Fairy.

I think it could be romantic.

You know, my parents met
at his place of work.

Your father's a gynecologist.

I know. What started as a pap smear
turned into a date.

Which turned into her working there,
which turned into marriage,

which then turned into hatred,
which continues to this day.

Two-Eyed Cyclops.

Would you please tell him
this isn't a good idea?

No. I think it'll be great.

Maybe next time he gets
conjunctivitis at work,

she can hold his head and try to put
the drops in his eyes.

Giant baby.

That's a Raging Ogre.

I know.

I'm just saying, I'd never want
to work with Bernadette.

Can you imagine seeing
someone all day long

and then you're supposed to hang out
with them after work, too?

Hold on. We do that all the time.

You and I work together
and play together.

I know, and it drove me
into the arms of another woman.

Bipolar Bear.

Well, I appreciate your concern,

but I won't be seeing any more of Amy
than I already do.

I assume we'll deduct any extra time
we spend together

at work from our weekly quota.

Please let me be there
when you tell her that.

Why? So you can see the look
on Amy's face

when she hears my top-notch idea?

Please, oh please,
just let me be there.

So, Amy, what are you gonna be
working on at Caltech?

I'm leading a study to see

if deficiency of the monoamine
oxidase enzyme leads

to paralyzing fear in monkeys.

If they're anything like humans,
the answer's yes.

Wait, you've done this
experiment on humans?

You mean like death row inmates
with nothing to lose?

No, that would be unethical.

Not a lot of people know this,
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme

was discovered by a woman,
Mary Bernheim.

That's right. My phone is
just as smart as you guys.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

SHELDON:
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

(KNOCKING)

Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

He's never gonna stop doing that,
is he?

I don't mind. I'm hoping to put
his love of repetition

to good use someday.

Um, I've reconsidered.

You can't work where I work.

- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Sheldon.

I already signed the contract.
I cashed a check.

Hmm.

You are not going
to come out of this looking good.

Sheldon, I don't understand.
I thought you were fine with it.

Well, I was. But that was before
Howard explained to me

how awful it would be if he had
to work with his significant other.

He said what?

Now, don't be insulted.

He just thinks too much of you would
be mind-numbingly tedious.

Excuse me, I need to have a chat
with my husband.

Well, now, keep it short.

From what I gather,
brevity is your friend.

So, are we good here?

No, we're not good here.
I am working on this project.

Yeah, you can't tell her
what she can and cannot do.

Last week, you told Leonard
he couldn't wear

his Wookiee jacket out in public.

That's different.
I'm not going to the mall

with someone dressed
like a dumb space bear.

Sheldon, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you.

I'll be in a different building,

and we don't even have
to have lunch together.

- Really?
- Yes.

Before all things, I'm a scientist.

I'm just there to do my work
and, with a little luck,

scare the living crap
out of some monkeys.

Hmm.

You sure your moth-like personality
won't be drawn

to this blazing fire that is myself?

More and more sure.

- Well, then, you have my permission.
- I didn't ask for your permission.

Too late. No backsies.

No, no, listen to me.
Sheldon misunderstood.

What I meant was,
if we worked together,

there'd be too much of me for you,
not the other way around.

Howard, if you're going to lie
to your wife,

don't start the sentence
with "Sheldon misunderstood."

- That's a dead giveaway.
- Well?

Okay, fine. I did say that,
and I think it's true.

I think if we worked together
and lived together,

we'd get sick of each other.

But to be fair, he only said the part
about him getting sick of you.

For the love of God, why?!

What exactly do you think
you'd get sick of?

His only options here are to fake
a heart attack or have a real one.

It's nothing in particular.

Is it my voice?
Am I too bossy?

My arm is feeling numb.

Nailed it.

That's the wrong arm
for a heart attack, doofus.

My point is, I'm sure there are
things about me

that would drive you crazy if you had
to deal with them all day long.

Like looking me in the eye
and lying to me?

Come on, I just...

Where am I supposed to look
when I lie to you?

Find somewhere else
to sleep tonight.

Bernie...

If it makes you feel any better,
Amy and I are fine.

I mean, really good.

So, boys,
how was the pajama party?

You guys jump on the bed
and sing into hair brushes?

It wasn't a pajama party.

It was just a couple of bros
hanging out, giggling,

eating cookie dough
and watching Princess Bride.

Please, stop talking.

"As you wish."

You know, Sheldon,
none of this would've happened

if I hadn't tried to help you.

It also wouldn't have happened
if, in the early universe,

hydrogen was a little more common
or a little less common.

This is fun. Your turn.

- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Amy.

Hello.

That was kind of icy.
You two okay?

We're fine.
As Howard advised,

she's merely respecting
our professional boundaries.

Smart. Take relationship advice
from a man

who spent last night
braiding Raj's hair.

You make a good point.

It would appear I was worried
for nothing.

Look at her, desperately wishing
she was over here at the cool table.

Don't worry, little moth.
The flame will come to you.

On the off chance that Bernadette
doesn't call back and apologize,

how do you feel about Mexican food
for dinner tonight?

I don't know.
Sounds kind of heavy.

That's 'cause you always fill up
on chips.

And this is Dr. Gunderson
from Stockholm.

Ah, Sweden.

Home of my favorite Muppet
and second favorite meatball.

Okay, the Nordic reputation
for lack of humor is well-founded.

Boy, is his name Gunderson
or No-Funderson?

Where are we going with this,
Dr. Cooper?

Please, I'm your boyfriend.
You call me Sheldon.

That's right,
I am in a boy-girl relationship

with this cute little lump of wool.

- Sheldon...
- It's a physical relationship, too.

Hand-holding, hugging...
even on hot days.

(THUD)

Ow!

Okay, here's a new one.

Apparently now we kick each other
in the shin under the table.

How do you like it
when I do it to you?

(THUD)

Not so much, huh?

Test subject D7,

aka Betsy, fear response study.

Image number one: Frenchman
on bicycle carrying baguettes.

(CLICK)

No visible reaction.

Image number two: sousaphone.

(CLICK)

Still no reaction. Okay.

Let's kick things up a notch.

Image number three: crocodile
with a mouthful of monkeys.

(SQUEALING)

Okay, now we're talking.

Dr. Fowler?

What do you want, Sheldon?

Well, I'm done with work, so...
(GASPS)

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Sorry.

Better?

Baguettes.
Yes, I like baguettes.

What exactly are you doing?

Determining baseline fear levels
in capuchin monkeys

by measuring their response
to visual stimuli.

So, goofing off.

As I was saying, I'm done with work
and Leonard's not.

So good news,
you get to take me home.

Play your cards right,
I'll let you drive me

past the lot
where the buses park at night.

I can't leave now, Sheldon.
I'm very busy.

Besides, why would I want to do you
a favor

after the way you treated me
in the cafeteria?

Image number four: boa constrictor.

(MONKEY SQUEALS,
SHELDON SHUDDERS)

What on earth are you talking about?

My behavior in the cafeteria
was delightful.

Maybe your friend Gunderson needs
to head over to IKEA

and assemble a sense of humor.

You embarrassed me in front of
my colleagues on my first day here.

Image number five:
kitten in a teacup.

Oh...

- Embarrassed you?
- You know what?

I don't have time for this.
Find another way home.

I'm starting to get the sense
that you're angry with me.

- Really? What tipped you off?
- Couple things, actually.

Your tone of voice,
your body language...

- Get out.
- Well, now, that.

(MONKEY SQUEALS)

Image number six: woman giving birth.

Oh!

(DOOR OPENS)

It's 9:00. Where you been?

I had to take the bus home.

Fell asleep and missed my stop.

Oh, no.

Did you know that Los Angeles has
a Little Sri Lanka?

- I did not.
- Well, I do... now.

They're a lovely people.

Although terrifying when you wake up
face-to-face with them.

If you're hungry, I brought home
some mutton in coconut milk.

Why'd you get that?
You hate lamb.

I was asking for directions.

Apparently, there was
a communication problem.

I thought Amy was gonna drive
you home.

I thought so, too,
but she's acting very strangely.

I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan
fellow on the bus,

and he hypothesized that a tiger may
have recently run across her shadow.

Although he may have just been trying
to drum up business

for his brother-in-law's
witch doctor practice.

Okay, Sheldon,
what happened between you and Amy?

Well, can you believe she said
I embarrassed her?

Yeah.

But you didn't even hear the details.

Sheldon...

I've known you a long time,
and I'm going to tell you this

with all the love
I can possibly muster.

Amy's right. You're wrong.

- But you don't even know...
- Doesn't matter.

- But, now, but in my defense...
- Doesn't matter.

You're not listening
to my side of it.

Okay, fine, Sheldon.
What is your side?

Well...

Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.

The shrimp was spicy.

You want a TUMS?

You got the tropical fruit kind?

No, if I buy those,
I just go through them like candy.

Tell me about it. One time, I swear
I pooped out a stick of chalk.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I may have overreacted.

Well, I didn't handle it
so great, either.

It's just sometimes I feel like
you enjoy spending time

with your friends more than with me.

- That's not true.
- It's not?

You spend all day together at work,

and then you all hang out at night
playing games,

going to the comic book store.

Last week, you two got
a couples massage.

So, when you said you wouldn't want
to spend that much time with me,

it really hurt my feelings.

I get that.
I'm so sorry.

Starting tomorrow,
I am turning over a new leaf.

Time with you is
my number one priority.

Why tomorrow?

Well, we're real close
to finishing off the new Batman game.

It is awesome.

You should probably go after her.

Should I go after you?

BERNADETTE: No!

Thanks for getting me in trouble.

Amy.

Sheldon, what are you doing here
so late?

I couldn't sleep
because I kept thinking

about what happened
earlier between us.

Also, I had one heck of a bus nap.

Speaking of which, do you want
some mutton in coconut milk?

- No.
- I cannot give this stuff away.

What do you want?

Amy, this isn't easy to say.

All relationships are difficult,

but even more so
when you're in one

with a person who struggles
with everyday social interactions

and, frankly, who can strike some
people as being kind of a weirdo.

Sheldon...
you're not a weirdo.

I wasn't speaking about me.

I mean, honestly, there's no telling
what will set you off.

You know, introducing myself
as your boyfriend.

Giving you the opportunity
to drive me home.

Breaking the ice with your colleagues
using ethnic humor,

the funniest kind of humor.

- What's your point?
- My point is, we're a couple.

And...
I like you for who you are.

Quirks and all.

- I like you, too.
- Well, I should hope so.

I don't see anyone else
banging on this door

to put up with your nonsense.

Not even a good-bye?

You see, that's the kind of thing
that makes people think you're weird.

AMY: Go away.

Poor kid.

She just doesn't see it.

I'm not apologizing to Howard.

He can come beg me on his knees.

Sheldon, too. If I see him at work,
I'm just going to ignore him.

All right, don't worry.
I talked to Leonard.

He is gonna sit the guys down
and set them straight.

Laser's warmed up.

Pull!

(English US - SDH)

- What are you working on?
- Can't talk. In the zone.

- Do you know what he's doing?
- Could be anything.

Last time he was like this,
he figured out

electron transport in graphene.

The time before that,
he was making a list of who's allowed

in his tree fort if he ever gets one.

Still can't believe
I didn't make the cut.

Sheldon, you want to take a break?
Your food's ready.

No, what are you doing?
He's both happy and quiet.

It's like seeing a unicorn
and Bigfoot at the same time.

Sorry we're so late.

Bernadette got stuck at work.

Great news! A raccoon virus
just crossed the species barrier

and now can infect humans!

Why is that great news?

In the pharmaceutical business,
we have a saying:

"Mo' infections, mo' money."

Wait!

Maybe you want to wash
your little raccoon hands first.

Calm down.
If I had it, I'd be dead already.

Guys, listen up.

Can't listen, zone.

Also don't care.

Next week is the anniversary
of my first date with Bernadette.

Really don't care.

I want to do something special,

and I was hoping you guys
could be a part of it.

What horrible thing
are you trying to make up for?

Just putting something in the bank
for what horrible thing I do next.

Ah.

Look, she's gonna be back any second,
so here's the deal:

I'm writing a song, and hoping we
could all play it for her together.

- I love that.
- That is so beautiful.

Sheldon?

When did we get
to The Cheesecake Factory?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

Yeah. Hey, how come
you've never done anything romantic

to celebrate our first date?

Well, for starters, you've broken up
with me so many times,

which first date
are we talking about?

Whoa! Somebody call
the burn ward.

And back to the zone.

And besides, I do romantic things
for you all the time.

Can you even name one romantic thing
you've done for me?

- I can name tons.
- Sex doesn't count.

I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

Well, I took you there.
All you did was...

I know what I did.

I bet they had to throw out
that rocking chair.

You know, I can be romantic
if I want to.

It's fine. And also not true.

Okay, just you wait and see.

I'm gonna romance
your freakin' ass off.

That's beautiful.
Is that Shakespeare?

- Sheldon?
- Zone.

He'll figure it out
when he falls off the roof.

Sheldon, I know you're in the zone,
but do you want some tea?

All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but

you haven't spoken in hours
and I'm starting to get worried.

Please say something.

Leonard, prepare to be humbled
and weep at the glory of my genius.

Nope, it was better before.

Look at it.

I feel like my mind just made a baby.

And it's beautiful.

It's not like human babies,
which are loud and covered in goop.

Holy crap, Sheldon,
did you just figure out a method

for synthesizing a new stable
super-heavy element?

Did I?
Well, that can't be right.

No one's ever done that before.
Except me, because I just did it!

âª Sheldon and his brain, yeah!
Sheldon and his brain, yeah!

- âª Sheldon and his brain... âª
- Definitely better before.

So, I'm almost done
writing the song for Bernadette.

Are you cool playing the cello?

If by "cool"
you mean "willing to," yes.

If by "cool" you mean "cool,"

clearly you've never seen me
play the cello.

Great. Will you play the ukulele?

Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

Or you could just play your tiny,
ridiculous guitar.

Fine. I will melt her heart.

And her face!

Gentlemen.

No doubt you heard
about my little breakthrough.

Now, if your plan
is to hoist me on your shoulders

and carry me around the cafeteria,
please refrain.

I don't care for heights,
motion sickness

or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.

Yeah, I read your paper online.

That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

Thank you.
Believe it or not,

I just learned
a Chinese research team

at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics

ran a test on a cyclotron,

and the results
were extremely promising.

Sheldon, that's incredible.

I know! They called it
the greatest thing

since the Communist party.

Although I'm pretty sure that the
Communist party made them say that.

I like China.

See, they know how
to keep people in line.

So, what happens next?

More testing,
more success, more fame.

But don't worry, I will remain
the same down-to-earth humble Joe

- I've always been.
- Good to know.

Now give me that cookie;
I discovered an element.

Thank you so much for coming.

You called the right person.

I believe I have the perfect romantic
evening for you to give Leonard.

Okay, good, 'cause I've been
really struggling with this.

As I'm sure you're aware,

the quickest way to a man's heart
is through his...

Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

Hm. You poor thing.

You have one arrow in your quiver,
and you just can't use it.

Fortunately, another pathway
to a man's heart

is through his stomach.

I don't know if I want to cook
for him; he's kind of a picky eater.

I mean, "It's too salty.
It's too dry.

It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

Wait, come on, what else
would sweep you off your feet?

Well, I've always had this fantasy
that involves dancing.

The sexual chemistry between
my partner and me is electric.

But boy, oh, boy,
does my father not approve

until he sees us
in the big dance competition.

Okay, that's just the plot
for Dirty Dancing.

What else would you love,
other than

being lifted
over Patrick Swayze's head?

Oh, oh. You could
stand outside his window

with a boom box in the air.

That's from Say Anything.

Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

Look, Penny,

if you truly want to be romantic,
it needs to come from you.

I get that, but why is this so hard?

Well, you've probably never had
to do this stuff 'cause you're young

and beautiful and men have
always thrown themselves at you.

Yeah, I'm trying to be sad
about that. I can't.

Let's see, what's next?
Okay! Here.

This is the Magic Marker

I was using
when I made the discovery.

I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

And that's why you're not
on the list for my tree fort.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Ooh! Guess who's getting an article

written about him in Physics Today?

I'll give you a hint.

You measured the diameter
of his suspicious mole yesterday.

Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

Well, you should be. My discovery
is spreading like wildfire.

Unlike my mole, which is holding
steady at the size of a navy bean.

What's next?

This is the very copy

of The Handbook
of Chemistry and Physics

in which I looked up the reaction
rates of mendelevium and...

- And what?
- No.

- No, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

I've made a horrible mistake.

What are you talking about?

This table,
it's in square centimeters.

I read it as square meters.

You know what that means?

That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

But the Chinese team
found the element.

They shouldn't have.
My calculations were wrong.

There must be some resonance between
the elements I didn't know about.

So you just got lucky?

Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky!

You and me both, brother.

It doesn't matter.
The element was found because of you,

and that's groundbreaking.

What matters is
the greatest scientific achievement

of my life is based on a blunder.

I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.

You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

that we thought was someplace else.

Great. Now I'm worse than
a fraud. I'm practically a biologist.

You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

There's nothing happy about it.

I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

People get things
they don't deserve all the time.

Look at me with you.

No, Leonard, this is going
to haunt me for the rest of my life:

every science classroom, every
periodic table, every textbook.

This mistake
will be staring back at me

Like that time you let Koothrappali
wax your eyebrows.

I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean,
once it's out there, it's out there.

This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

Frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.

You don't know
what a sex tape is, do you?

No.

Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

Bernadette's
meeting me there at 8:30.

- I don't want to blow the surprise.
- We'll be there.

Got it. Now, I have
a question about the song.

I was thinking at some point
I could bust out a little rap.

Nah, nah, nuh, nuh, nuh, no.

Come on, come on,
you haven't even heard it yet.

Leonard, give me a beat.

I will not.

Please?

- No, I want this to be romantic.
- It will be!

I don't call anyone a ho,
and the only time

I use the phrase "my bitch,"
I'm referring to you.

MAN: There he is!
(APPLAUSE)

Stop it. Stop celebrating me!

Woo!

And no woos!

Not you, Dr. Woo, you're fine.

I want you all to know that
you have no reason to applaud me.

My so-called breakthrough
wasn't the result of my genius.

It was nothing more
than a boneheaded mistake.

So please refrain from praising me
for it in the future.

I don't understand.
They didn't find the element?

No, they found the element.

(APPLAUSE) No, no, stop it!

I don't need to take this admiration
from the likes of you people!

- How do I make them stop loving me?
- Invite them to live with us.

Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.

It must be nice to have someone
do something so romantic.

Okay, you know what's not romantic?

Rubbing it in someone's face.

Actually, it can be,
but I told you sex doesn't count.

I'm getting worried about Bernadette.
I'm gonna call and check on her.

The National Science Foundation
wants to give me a substantial grant.

- That's a big deal.
- I know.

When will this nightmare end?

Hey, I get that you feel bad about
all the attention,

but still, what you did is amazing.
We're really proud of you.

- I'm not.
- You're not?

Sheldon, I've been thinking about it,

and you're right,
you don't deserve any credit.

All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

A very easy table, too.

Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.

That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

Damn it, everyone's
better at this than me.

Congratulations, Dr. Fowler.
You just made the fort.

Guys, there was an accident
at Bernie's lab.

My God, is she okay?

Yeah, but she's at the hospital
in quarantine.

- What?
- Poor Bernadette.

I hate to pile on the bad news,
but I just got a raise.

My God, Bernie, what happened?

Well, let's just say the next time
you move a dozen vials

of raccoon virus to the fridge,
make two trips.

You're sure you're okay?

Yeah, it's just a precaution.
If there was a problem,

I'd be throwing up
out of my eyeballs by now.

- Sorry I messed up our date.
- No, don't worry about it.

I brought the date here.

Guys, come on in.

What's all this?

Well, tonight is the anniversary
of our first date,

and I wanted to celebrate it
by writing a song for you.

Howie.

Sheldon, get over here!

She might be contagious.

Don't you think I'm having
a rough enough day?

Sheldon!

âª (PLAYING UPBEAT SONG

âª If I didn't have you

âª Life would be blue

âª I'd be Doctor Who

âª A candle without a wick
A Watson without a Crick

âª I'd be one of my outfits
without a dickey

âª I'd be cheese without the mac

âª Jobs without the Wozniak

Look, I'm shaking.

She's sick, I knew it. Bye!

I have to say, this is the best

I discovered a secret ingredient:
the flavor packet.

That sucker is well named.

All right, lover boy, get ready,

'cause there is a crap storm
of romance coming your way.

Stop it, you're gonna make me cry.

âª (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS) âª

All right, you seem pretty confident.

Oh, I am.

Maybe if you follow this trail,

you'll see why.

- Oh... Rose petals.
- Yes.

The most beautiful and shockingly
expensive of all the flowers.

You made the bed? You really
are pulling out all the stops.

Okay, I gave this a lot of thought,

and I finally found something
to show you how much I love you.

Oh, wow.

It's a first edition
of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I remember it was your
favorite book growing up.

This is great.

Thank you... so much.

What?

Nothing. I love it.

No, something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

I remember you saying how great
it would be to have a first edition.

It's true, I did. I did say that...

...when we were at
the used bookstore together

and I saw the first edition
and I bought it.

Oh my God, I am the worst!

No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

No, it's not! I mean...

What's thoughtful
is everything you do.

Here, you know what?
Look at this.

Look, here's the...
the plane ticket you bought me

when I was too poor
to go home for the holidays.

And the rose you left
on my windshield... just because.

Here's the thank-you letter
you wrote me

after the first time
I slept with you.

All 11 pages of it.

Can't believe
you saved all this stuff.

Of course I did. It's you.

Come here.

Is that a pregnancy test?

Just the first one.
I didn't save them all.

I can't believe
I read this table wrong.

I blame you.

Me? What did I do?

You distract me.

I've been distracted
since the moment I met you.

- Sorry.
- Well, you should be.

Because all I can think about
is how much I want to kiss you.

And not just on the cheek,
but on the mouth.

Like mommies and daddies do.

Oh, Sheldon.

SHELDON: Amy?

Amy? Did you hear what I said?

Can't talk, in the zone.

(English US - SDH)

(HUMMING)

I've never seen him
this happy before.

It's because you've never seen him on
"Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day."

Look!

A new topical
antihistamine with lidocaine.

Wow!

I can't wait until I get a rash.

Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

I guess they really do
read their mail.

Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?

Oh, yeah.

Look at him, just standing in line,

like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

Let's go say hello.

Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

He thinks there's a difference.

Arthur?

Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper.

You may not remember
because of your advanced age.

Trust me, I... I remember.

This is my girlfriend, Amy.

Amy, this is television
legend Arthur Jeffries.

His science show
inspired millions of children.

Hold... Hold on.

You... You have a girlfriend?

Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

Hey, look, we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

I can't believe I dress
like a celebrity.

Okay, I get it now.

Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, oh, right,
I remember your girlfriend.

Is she... is she here?

No, she's not.

So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

- Sheldon.
- No. Wait, I want to guess.

Don't tell me.

I wasn't going to tell you.

Sheldon, come on.

No, no, no. I'm really good at this.
All right, give me a hint.

Does it involve difficulty initiating
a stream of anything?

Well, given my age,
that's more than just a lucky guess.

Hey, Sheldon,
let's go mock the people

buying homeopathic medicine.
You love that.

But I'm hanging out with my friend,
and we're having fun.

Look how happy he is.

(SIGHS)

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

You want to do something?

- Actually, I'm busy.
- Doing what?

There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave.

- You're going to girls' night.
- Yeah.

You know
they're making jewelry, right?

You think they came up with that?

They were going
to drink beer and play darts.

- What's up?
- Not his testosterone levels.

Excuse me. I happen to be very
comfortable with my masculinity.

How is that possible?

(CELL PHONE DINGS)

Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

Goody! What's it say?

He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

and wants to know
if I'd take a look at it.

That's strange,

that he would come to you
for that and not me.

Oh, I got two emails from him.

"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

And...

"Never mind, I found it."

I can't believe
he picked you over me.

You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

who hasn't done
any real science in decades.

Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

It's true. You'd rust.

And to think I idolized that man.

And why?

At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

Is it really worth
getting upset about?

They say don't meet your heroes.

Don't peek behind
that curtain of fame and celebrity,

because if you do,
you'll see them as they really are:

degenerate carnival folk.

Come on,
he's a retired kids show host.

That's even worse.
Using the sweet candy of science

to trick children into loving him.

Pervert.

Have you thought about why Arthur
didn't want you to read his paper?

Yes, I have.

And my only conclusion is the
prescription he was picking up

the other day was for cuckoo pills.

Maybe he found you a bit much.

That's kind of a stretch.

Look, when it comes to social skills,
I've mastered the big three.

There's the coy smile.

There's the friendly chuckle.

(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

There's the vocalization of sympathy.

Aww...

That last one's tricky.
I'm still working on it.

From what I saw the other day,

I could understand why he and...

some people might find you...

What?

Doesn't matter.

No, go ahead, say it.

I know what it is.
I've heard it my whole life.

The word's "annoying".
Go ahead, say it.

Say it. Say I'm annoying.

- Sheldon...
- Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

I'm annoying. I'm annoying.

I'm annoying.
Yeah, now where are you going?

Look, you know you want
to say it. Say it.

Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

Say it. Say it. Amy, say it.

Well, she can't stand it
when I'm right.

This is fun.

I'm going to feel like such
a vixen wearing jewelry

that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

Penny, how's it going over there?

Good. I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

How do you not know how to use glue?
Did you ditch pre-school?

Yeah, but only because
I was dating a second grader.

Hello, everyone.

Okay, let me have it.

Let's hear all
the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

Nope, Bernadette told me
it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

- Thank you.
- So I won't be making fun of you,

or the things you like, or the fact
that you just want to have fu-un.

Howie, stop.
Come on, look at what I'm making.

Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

- I'm making a bracelet.
- Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

You know, instead of beads and glue,

you guys can use my soldering iron.

You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

Actually, I'd kind of like
to try that.

- Me, too.
- Be right back.

When did I have pistachios?

Arthur.

Door knocker.

That's TV money.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?

I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

Of course you woke me.
It's 7:30.

Well, I would have been here sooner,
but for some reason your home

isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

What do you want, Sheldon?

It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

that I may have been annoying to you.

She sounds like a keeper.

Anyway, I wanted to apologize.
I am truly sorry.

All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

Now that we've cleared the air,

I wanted to discuss
another matter with you.

Sheldon, in a couple hours,
I have to get up,

pee and then wander
around the house.

Well, then, I'll make this quick.

I want to talk about the paper
you sent Leonard.

Now, I know he said it's promising

and he's going to collaborate on it,

but now that you and I are friends
again, I am at your disposal.

And, frankly, lending my name

and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

that you're a washed-up has-been.

Or dead.

I should be so lucky.

So, what do you say?

You know,
if it's all the same with you,

I think I'll stick with Leonard.

It's because I'm annoying, right?
I know it is. Say it.

Say it. Say I'm annoying.

- Good night.
- Say it.

Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it.

I'm annoying. Say it.

You're annoying!

Wow, that really hurt.

If you would have told me
when I was a kid

that someday
I would be doing science

next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

If someone had told me that people
would still call me Professor Proton

when I was 83 years old,

I never would have quit smoking.

I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

This nano vacuum tube idea
of yours, it's really interesting.

Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur.

What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

Why is it odd?

Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

with a beloved children's
television science personality.

Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

It's an honor to meet you.

My show never would
have happened without yours.

That's what I told my lawyers.

Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got
you involved in this nonsense.

He said I'd be speaking to a class.

No, I said you were teaching
someone a lesson. Now let's go.

What are you guys working on?

Oh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

- That's interesting.
- Haven't you stolen enough from me?

Back off, bow tie!

Hey, guys, what do you think?

Wow, Penny, good job.

Thanks. Target, 4.99.
I'm getting a drink.

- What are you working on?
- I'm making a necklace for my mom.

That's sweet.

Yeah, she and my dad are
going through a bit of a rough patch,

so I wanted to do something to let
her know I was thinking about her.

What's going on with them?

They're just having
a little trouble communicating.

My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

makes him want to tear his ears off
and sew them over his eyes

so he never has to look at her again.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

Look who's here to put
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night."

Oh, sure,
so it's fine when you say it.

Sorry we're late.
I wanted to swing by the lab

and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

- I didn't know you were coming again.
- Well, last week was a blast.

Plus, I thought you might
like having a guy here.

It was not funny.

So, what tools did you bring?

Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

Here's some silver, a crucible

and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

Ooh! That looks like fun.

Maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire.

Okay, who's up first?

Rajesh, want to make a bracelet
for your mom to go with the necklace?

No, thanks.

I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

She's just chins and fat and feet.

Okay, we're almost ready to go.

Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

This is so exciting, I feel...

like I'm 75 again.

Oh, God.

What... what is it?

Sheldon just sent me a picture of him
and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

Why do you put up with Sheldon?

Oh.

You know, because we're friends.

Why?

Wow, you ask really hard questions.

Yeah.

Look, I know he can be aggravating,

but what you have to remember is that
he's not doing it on purpose.

It's just how he is.

But he's also loyal and trustworthy

and we have fun together.

You know you're describing a dog.

He did bite me once.

But in his defense, I came up
behind him while he was eating.

Yeah, they hate that.

You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

He's a little broken
and he needs me.

I guess I need him, too.

Why is that?

Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

Oh, geez.

Another photo from Sheldon?

No, I have to go pick him up.

Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

He probably stole his wallet, too.

You know, if you guys are interested,

there's a technique
where I can take a lock of your hair,

refine it into carbon dust,
and use the hydraulic press at work

to turn it into a tiny little diamond
with your DNA in it.

Oh, that's amazing!

Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

That came right off my mom's back.

He's kidding.

If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

"My name is Howard.
I can make your hair into diamonds.

My mom is morbidly obese.
Everybody love me."

Whoa, where is that coming from?

I'll tell you where it's coming from.

All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night,

and now you're here ruining it
for everyone.

Raj, cool it.
He's gonna make us hair diamonds.

How am I ruining anything?

I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.

But this isn't about the jewelry.

This is about me having a place where
I can open up about my feelings.

Since when can't you open up
with me?

There are just some things

that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

because they won't make fun of me

or and call me names, or ask me if my
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

Buddy, I was just joking around.

Yeah, well,
sometimes your jokes hurt.

(SIGHS)

You're right.

I didn't realize
I was making you feel that way.

It was very brave of you to tell me.

Thank you.

It wasn't easy.

They're gonna have sex
before Sheldon and I do. I knew it.

- Arthur.
- Hi, Sheldon.

I'm surprised to see you here.

Yeah, me, too.

Somewhere around the third floor,

I began to see a white light.

I'll get Leonard.

No, no, no, I'm...

I'm here to see you.

If you're hoping to get in touch
with Bill Nye, I can't help you.

I've been informed that he's now
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

No, I'm... I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

I'd like to get your opinion
about my paper.

Thank you. It would be an honor.

Oh, great.

Well, actually, I don't need that.

I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

And... what did you think?

Well, first, I think the fact

that you use your birthday
as a password is embarrassing.

Thank you.

Second...

I thought your paper was inspired.

Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

Can I invite you in for tea?

No, no. I really... I have to run.

Hey, Arthur. How are you?

Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

Hey, buddy, what's up?

Well, I was feeling bad
about how I acted the other night

so I made you a little something.

- You didn't have to do that.
- Well, it was fun.

I used some of the jewelry techniques
you taught us.

(CHUCKLES)

It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

This is so cool. Thanks.

It gets better.

Wow!

And that's not even the best part.

See?

I have one, too.

Check it out.

You can wear yours,

and we can have little sword fights
whenever we want.

(IMITATES LIGHTSABER)

Yeah, and my eighth favorite
episode of Professor Proton

was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

You said, "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,

oh, what a blast-off it is."

Remember?
Remember that? Remember?

He can't help it.
He can't. He really can't.

Wait here,
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

we can build that rocket,

and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

As long as I'm not
within 500 feet of it.

So, you...

you have... you have any...

single grandmothers?

Sorry, they're both married.

Good.

Ha... ha...

happily?

(English US - SDH)

- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

You've had this dart board
since I've known you.

But I've never seen you play.

Oh, we played... once.

I broke a window.

What window?

That one over there.

Leonard,
where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

Skee-Ball tickets?

Yeah, from when we went
to the arcade three years ago?

I finally decided what prize I want.

Hurry up.

If I still have them,
they're probably in the junk box.

- Ooh, what are you gonna get?
- None of your business.

But when you see me wearing
a flower in my lapel later,

you are most welcome to sniff it.

- Yup, got 'em, here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

Here, get yourself an eraser
for your troubles.

Oh, I forgot about this.

My aunt made it for me
when I started college.

Aw, did she hate you?

Why? Because I got an ugly,
itchy sweater,

and my brother got a car?
No, I was her favorite.

Yeah, I seem to be
a few tickets short.

Are there more in the box?

I think I got them all.

Nope, they're not in there.

Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

No, no, no, I looked, and...
No more tickets.

- Leonard, let me look in the box.
- Okay, Okay!

I'm gonna show you what's in the box.
But just... promise not to flip out?

Why would I flip out? Is it a spider?

(GASPS) It's a spider!

No, if it was a spider,
Lenny would've flipped out.

Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed
to return this DVD a long time ago,

and I know we
rented it on your card.

But it's been, like, seven years,

and clearly nothing bad has happened.

So instead of being a giant
pain in the ass, like you always are,

what if this one time
you just tried staying calm?

That seems like a reasonable request.

Although so did, "Hey, Leonard,
would you mind returning that DVD?"

I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

Okay.

I mean it. I'm going to.

I believe you.

And you're going to stay calm?

I said I would.

How about that?

Sheldon's being reasonable.

Yeah, it's freaking me out.
I'm gonna go.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

So... when you say

you're not going
to freak out about the DVD,

here's what that means.

Don't fixate on it,

don't wake me up
in the middle of the night,

or nag me through the door
while I'm on the toilet.

Okay, first, talking to you
while you're on the toilet

isn't exactly a picnic for me either.

Remember, when you can hear me,
I can hear you.

And, second,
you completely disregard

how uncomfortable
unresolved issues are for me.

It's like, an itch in my brain
I can't scratch.

When I broke my arm I used
to stick a coat hanger down there.

You ever try that?
Maybe go in through the ear?

You wouldn't make jokes
if you could feel the way I feel.

Well, I don't know how to do that.

How about this?

I promise I won't pester you
about the DVD.

You can defecate in peace.
That's a win for both of us.

But...

until this matter is resolved,

I would like you

to wear this sweater.

With nothing underneath it.

That's stupid. Why?

You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

I say situations like this
make me feel the same way.

I'm telling you, try the hanger.

Put it on.

Let's share the experience.

You got it.

If this sweater shuts you up,
I'm gonna make a fortune

selling them to everyone we know.

Now all I need to do

is head down to the video store

and return the DVD.

Oh, did I forget to tell you?

That store went out
of business years ago.

Really?

How those nipples feeling, chief?

Penny, can we please get our drinks?

Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

At work today, I did
an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

Cool. At my lab, I performed
ten laser capture micro-dissections.

I scraped gum
off the bottom of that table.

Only because my manager
saw me put it there.

Oh, my gosh.

That's the girl
that broke Rajesh's heart.

That's Lucy?

I don't know why but I always
pictured her as Indian.

I think that reason's called racism.

I'm gonna go talk to her.

Why? What are you gonna say?

I'm not gonna say anything.
I just want to check her out.

Because she hurt my friend.
My Indian friend.

Who's racist now?

You because you just called him
your "Indian friend."

Yeah, well, you're short.

We're never getting our drinks.

No, but we knew that.

Hey, can I start you off
with something to drink?

- Oh, water would be great.
- Okay.

You're Lucy, right?
I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

Actually Amy recognized you.

Wow. How's he doing?

Oh, you know, he's good.

Great.

Yeah, this is none of my business.

But why did you break up
with him in an e-mail?

Oh, I don't know.

I guess I thought it would be easier.

Yeah, I get that.
I'll go get you your water.

When you say "easier,"

you mean easier for you, right?

'Cause it certainly
didn't make it easier for him.

Any chance I can get
a different waitress?

I'm sorry, this is rude of me.
I will get that water.

See, see, see, see.

Just now you expressed
your feelings to my face.

How come you could do that
with me, but not with Raj?

I don't know your e-mail.

You know what the worst part is?
You're sitting here, perfectly happy

and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

I also said I was getting you water,
but look at me still standing here.

You know, I may be a bad waitress,
but you are a bad person.

Now, you want to hear the specials?

- So, you can never take it off?
- No.

Not even to sleep?

No.

So, you're just an idiot?

It's called proving a point.

Is the point you're an idiot?

Gentlemen, please.

Leonard is trying to walk
a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

He can't walk in my actual shoes.

He has the feet of a toddler.

So, how are you gonna return the DVD
if the store went out of business?

Monday morning I'll go downtown,
look up the owner's information,

send him the DVD.

(SIGHS)

Pay the late fee...

and prove to Sheldon
that you can have a problem...

and solve it...

without acting
like a complete lunatic.

Ahh!

And the man impersonating a bear
would like everyone to know that,

(IMITATES SMOKEY BEAR)
Only you can prevent forest fires.

I don't get it.

You didn't have
Smokey the Bear in India?

No. Oh, is he anything like
Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

He taught us not to play with cobras.

You had to be taught
not to play with cobras?

You had to be taught
not to burn down the forest?

If you guys were hungry, why didn't
you order at the restaurant?

We did.
You never brought it.

Oh, that's right.

Nachos and a turkey club.

Not even close.

Well, I was too busy
standing up for my friend

to worry about your...

I want to say salmon.

You want to say sorry.

So, how are you gonna
tell Raj abut what you did?

What do you mean "how"?
What's the big deal?

You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

Then you made her cry and leave.

Okay, you guys are overreacting.

Raj is gonna appreciate
how I had his back.

What is wrong with you, Penny?!

You ruined any chance I had
of getting back with Lucy!

(CELL PHONE DINGS)

Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

instead of just being pretty sure!

It's Lucy.

She wants to meet for coffee.

I love you, Penny!

Hey, what are you working on?

I'm thinking about
how one could use the fact

that a rapidly rotating mirror
turns virtual photons into real ones

as a method of observing dark energy.

That's a pretty cool idea.

Yeah. It's great you're here.

I'd love to get
an engineer's opinion.

Sure.

This chair is squeaky.

Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

Well, Sheldon,
it took me all morning,

but I found the owner
of the video store.

And I am happy to report
that he died peacefully in his sleep,

drunk at the bottom of a pool.

Anyway, there is no one
to return the DVD to,

so this issue is resolved.

And I'd just like to point out that

even though the sweater
was uncomfortable,

I didn't use it as an excuse
to antagonize everyone around me.

You know, you could reimburse
the video store owner's next of kin.

Or it's resolved!

Hey, that next of kin thing
sounds pretty good.

I believe this is yours.

Can I ask you guys a question?

So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,
and I've never hung out

with someone who broke up with me.
How do you do it?

You can't let her know you're
hurting. The key is confidence.

Why is the key always confidence?

How come it's never
love handles and flop sweat?

If this girl hurt you so much, are
you sure you want to see her again?

Well, if I may,
he has so little self-respect

and is so desperate
for the smallest crumb of affection,

she could literally sleep
with his own father in his own bed

and post the video to YouTube,
and he'd still buy her flowers

and ask her to be his bride.

He's right.

But in my defense,
if we could survive that,

we could survive anything.

Well, if you're sure you want
to do this, it's only coffee.

Just relax and see what happens.

- Well, can I say she looks nice?
- Sure.

Can I tell her I miss her?

Maybe, if she asks.

Can I show her
an oil painting I made of us

surrounded by our children
and grandchildren?

I'd save that for the second date.

Good, good,
'cause no matter how hard I try,

I cannot get the twins to look alike.

What are you doing?

Oh, I'm just trying to find
the stupid next of kin

to this stupid video store owner,
so I can return the DVD

and see the look
on Sheldon's stupid face

when he sees that I didn't
let this get to me.

Sheldon's not here.
Why don't you take the sweater off?

- There's a principle at stake!
- Which is?

Oh, I don't know.
Who cares? Look at me!

(GASPS)

Oh, my God!
Is that sweater made of bees?

Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

No, no, honey, if I take it off,
Sheldon wins.

Sweetie, every night you don't
kill him in his sleep, he wins.

No, it's almost done.

I just... I have to find
the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD

and then just wait for someone
with my complexion to die

so I can get a skin graft.

Smile.

What is that? What is that for?

So you can send it to Princeton
and get your money back.

I must say, Sheldon,
you're handling this DVD business

with an impressive amount
of maturity.

I don't know why that surprises you.
I'm a grown man.

As should be evident
by this sport coat

and very real flower in my lapel.

Is there some kind of new coping
mechanism you're employing?

The more interesting question
you should be asking is,

"What does this flower smell like?"

I'm gonna go with sad.

So what's the story
with you and this DVD?

There's nothing to tell.

Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

and I followed its wise suggestions,
one of which was:

stop and smell the flowers.

- Seriously?
- Please.

Haha!

- Hi.
- Hello.

- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- You, too.

Please, sit.

I got you a cappuccino.
I remembered it was your favorite.

I also got crumb cake,

but remembered
it was my favorite, and I ate it.

Anyway, how are you?

I'm pretty good.

Listen, I just wanted to apologize

for breaking up with you
in an e-mail.

And I ate all the crumb cake.
We both made mistakes.

Okay.

I'm so happy you asked me here,

and I hope we can hang out
again sometime.

You know, as friends,
lovemaking partners, whatever.

Oh...

I'm kind of seeing someone.

I think I know the answer to this,

but just to be clear,
it's not me, right?

This is all your fault!

I should've listened to Mun-Mun
because I've been playing

with a cobra and her name is Penny!

Why are you so cruel?
Do you enjoy my pain?

There's a girl at the Cheesecake
Factory I can set you up with.

I love you, Penny!

How is it I can conceptualize
a methodology

of examining dark matter
in the universe

but can't figure out how
to fix a novelty squirt flower?

I think the real question is,

why do you waste your time
with cheap, childish pranks?

There's probably a deep reason,

which I'd be happy
to discuss with you

over some peanut brittle in a can.

Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options!

Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

has no next of kin!

Well, you seem hot
under the collar...

or is that the sweater?

Oh, oh, no, no.
It's because I spent all afternoon

at the Armenian church
where his funeral mass was held.

According to Father Solakian,

no one attended.

Luckily, my trip
wasn't a complete waste.

I lit a candle
and prayed for your death.

But I'm not Armenian,
so it probably won't work!

This is over, right?

Oh, not necessarily.

I suggest you look
for long-lost relatives

either in Armenia or Lebanon.

Listen to me, Sheldon.

I am not going to Lebanon

to return
Super Mario Bros. the movie!

Anyway, it might be fun.
You love hummus.

Why isn't this bothering you?

Isn't your brain getting itchy?

This is on your card.

This could be ruining
your credit score!

Why isn't this making you crazy?

Leonard...

I have something to tell you,

but I want you to promise
not to flip out.

What?

Seven years ago,

I found out the DVD was late
and I paid for it.

What?

I was going to mention it
at the time,

but then I thought, some day,

this might be a teachable moment.

(GASPS)

Ahh!

But I...?! You...?! How...?!

What?!

Sheldon, that was diabolical.

I know.

And it wasn't easy.

Do you have any idea what it's like
to wait for years,

and never know if you're going
to finally get satisfaction?

Wow.

You're even prettier than Penny said.

I can't believe a girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend.

Well, I don't.

I don't believe you.
You're lying to me!

What?

It's okay. I have no morals,
and I'm desperately lonely.

I'll be the other man if you want
a little something-something

on the side.

What is wrong with you?!

(English US - SDH)

The math is all there.

- It's not real.
- Yes, it is.

Look.
It is scientifically impossible

for a person to tip a cow.

Even you, with your stocky build

and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

It's horrible. Why would you push
a cow over? They're sacred.

Oh, stop it.

I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

I clearly remember
the cow standing up

and then the cow on its side.

Were you drunk?

I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

I think you're the one who fell over.

That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

- Hey.
- Howard.

Cow tipping: real or not?

I'm going to say... not.

That's just based on me
trying to roll

my mom over when she's snoring.

Speaking of that big side of beef,

she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

Mmm.

You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

offer up a polite excuse, so...

I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

that sounds awful.

Come on, it'll be fun.

We were actually
going to do it here.

Please?
Bernadette's bringing her dad,

because her mom's out of town,

and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

Since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

but that sounds even more awful.

It'd actually be nice to not hear

Sheldon complain
about my cooking all day.

SHELDON: Excuse me,

but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

and every year I criticize it.

Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

- I want to go.
- Yeah, me, too.

- I'm in.
- Sheldon.

(GROANS) Fine, I'll go.

But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

and it's on you.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

We do.

And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

Being dragged from their homes

to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

in the history of mankind?

Yes.

Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

I spent one in Vegas.

You did?

Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

It was actually more fun
than I thought.

We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

we had a really good
turkey dinner.

Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

Wait, you went to a chapel?

- Yeah.
- Why?

We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

Penny...

you know those are real, right?

No, they're not.

Yeah, they are.

No, they're not.

Yeah, they are.

- He's right.
- They're real.

But it... didn't seem real.

Let me ask you a question.

At any point,
was Las Vegas on its side?

- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey. Mm.

Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

Okay.
Yeah, it's for everybody.

I really just wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

and watch the game.

You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

MOTHER: Howard,
the medicine's not working!

HOWARD: You just took it.

At least let it
reach your first stomach!

Hey, Mike.

Let me help you out, there.

Thanks.
What's wrong with your mom?

Oh, her gout's flaring up.

Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

MOTHER: How can
one little toe hurt so bad?

Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

She should quiet down soon.

I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

I guess we're going to
have to do all the cooking.

I have a better idea.

If you think you're
going to make me

do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

I was going to make Raj
do it all by himself.

Oh, well, that's a great idea.

No traffic, we're sailing.

Yes. Like we're on a ship.

Coming from Africa to America.

Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

Yes, Miss Amy.

I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

Would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

You need to get
this taken care of.

I will. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

Oh! I have a reason.

It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

but every time
Leonard's proposed,

he's gotten a resounding no.

That's just off the top of my head.

So how do I undo this?

I'm hoping you can
get an annulment,

so it's just like
it never happened.

Great, well, what do I have to do?

It says here
you can get an annulment

if any of the following
conditions are met.

"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

(LAUGHS)
Penny? Next.

"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

want of understanding?"

'Want of understanding?'

What does that even mean?

Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

Thanks for saving the day.

No problem.

It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

without an Indian
providing the food.

Now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

I don't know.

Probably in a wad in her cheek.

I'll help Raj in here.
Why don't you go keep my dad company?

Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

who has sex with his daughter.

- Don't be silly, he loves you.
- Does he?

- Okay, he cares about you a lot.
- Really?

I do crap for you all the time.
Get out there.

So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

Uh-huh.

You know, my mom's been to Arizona.

She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

Because she's so fat.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

- Hey, guys.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

It smells wonderful.

Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

- Because I, too, know...
- Sheldon.

Here. Thank you for having us.

What's with you?

She's mad at me

because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

Really?

That dumb-ass you used to date?

That's hysterical.

I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

You need any help?

Yeah, can you reach
that gravy boat up there?

- Uh, sure.
- Great.

That makes one of you.

Okay we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yam detail.

Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

That's right, I see you.

Okay if you have any questions,

I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

Focus is key.

Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

- What?
- Wha...?

You ever play football?

A little in college.

- You?
- No.

But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

The whole school cheered.

I found the, court papers

that you and Zack
need to fill out.

- I'll print them when we get home.
- Fine.

And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

Are you done?

- What?
- Look, I get it, I screwed up.

Is this all we're going to talk
about the rest of the day?

Why are you mad at me?

You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

- I'm just trying to fix it.
- (GROANS) I need some air.

Well... Penny.

Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

but I would not follow her.

Listen to Stretch.

How am I the bad guy?

She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

Can I weigh in here?

Sure.

I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

(GROANS)

How do you not make
a first down there?

They passed against
a nickel defense.

They should have run it off-tackle.

How the hell do you know that?

My father loved football.

He always made me watch it

before I was allowed
to do my homework.

(DOOR OPENS)
PENNY: Well...

You'll be happy to know
I just spoke to Zack

and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

He's on his way here now.

- Wait, you invited him here?
- Yeah.

I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

Come on.

What do you think
they ought to do now?

I would throw a quick slant
to a wide-out,

given that the defense
is showing blitz.

Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

Get it?

Because it sounds like "blintz."

MOTHER: Did someone say blintz?

I just don't understand

why you invited him here today.

Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

so I just thought it would...

Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

No, no, speak up.

I'm about to use the blender,

and I don't want to miss anything.

Well, you might have
to cook for one more

because she invited Zack.

- AMY: What?
- BERNADETTE: What?

My, my.

The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

There's not an angle
to do one's business

without a clown figurine
staring at you.

- That's why I sit.
- Yeah, that's why.

You remember
the Thanksgiving game

when it snowed in Dallas?

Nineteen-ninety three. Leon Lett blew
the game in the final seconds

and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

So was my dad.

And then he did.

- Anyone need a beer?
- Yeah.

Thank God.

So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

No.
He died when I was 14.

I'm sorry to hear that.

So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

He cried and cried.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

No, sir.

He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

but I was 11 and my mom said, no.

Well, you're having one with me.

All right.

To your dad.

I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

I wonder what she saw in that guy.

I don't know.

He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

Broad shoulders, good hair.

Hmm, wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

How's it going out there?

Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

I know how you feel.

Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

I kick it when he's not looking.

What are they doing?

They're drinking beer
and watching football.

So why don't you do that
with them?

- They don't want me.
- What do you mean?

Well, Sheldon started talking
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

and they were toasting,
and I tried to tell them

about how sad I was
when my dad abandoned...

(DOORBELL RINGS) Zack's here!

Stir the gravy.

Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

I'll be back in, like, five, ten minutes.

Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

Plus, Penny told me we're married,

and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

Yeah, okay great.

Can we just get this over with?

Yeah, you guys
have to sign here and here.

On Monday,
we'll file for the annulment,

and this "marriage" will be over.

Okay.

I don't know if I want to sign it.

ALL: Ooh!

Why won't you sign it?

I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

We don't have any kids.

Are you sure?
Because you didn't know

we were married
until this morning.

Okay, look, Zack, come on.

You know neither of us
thought this was real.

I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

Of course it was an impersonator.

We could never afford
a real Elvis.

You married him instead of me?

Good call.

Sign the papers.

Hang on.
You know what?

You have been a jerk
about this all day.

You always do this!
Whenever I mess up,

you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

That is not true.

We could've waited till Monday,

signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

You're the one who
invited him here.

There you go again.
Just another mistake

you're throwing in my face.

Not cool, bro.

I'm starting to think

you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

Yeah, well, she's not going to
be your wife for long.

Oh, no.
Are you dying?

I'm about to.
Sign the paper.

Know what they say:
"Happy wife, happy life."

Let's eat.

(BELCHING) Two, three,
eight, four, six.

That's all I can do
without throwing up.

That is not what I expected

when you said you
were going to burp "pi."

MOTHER: Did somebody say pie?

I don't know what's scarier:

the bathroom clowns,

or the woman
that put them there.

All I know is you can
only fit one of her in a car.

And there's the clown
that came out of her.

I really didn't want
to come here,

but this is shaping up to be

one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

Me, too.

Hey. Howard says you've
been making fun of him all day!

Now, both of you apologize right now!

She's so tiny.

It's funny when she's mad.

All right, mister, I think you owe

Howard and Bernadette an apology.

Perhaps you're right.

I'm sorry for my behavior.

I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

to be inappropriate.

- It's okay.
- Don't worry about it.

Thank you.

Ain't she great?

Sheldon.

Now, how's about you get
us a couple of beers?

Thanks again for cooking.

Yeah, everything was delicious.

Well, I couldn't have done it
without my two favorite girls.

Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

Hey, Sheldon,
what do you say we go outside

and throw around the old pigskin?

This is a Jewish house.

I don't think they have pigskin.

MOTHER: Did someone say pigskin?

Hey, I'm sorry about today.

And I promise,
next time I get married,

it won't be a joke.

It'll be for love.

Or money.

I'm sorry, too.

Don't be.
It's my fault.

I was a terrible husband.

I was never around.

I know I'm hard on you,

but you're not the worst
son-in-law in the world.

Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

Well, I'm drunk.

I just vomited on a lot of clowns.

(English US - SDH)

PENNY: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

Sheldon, did you just figure out

a method for synthesizing
a new stable super-heavy element?

Did I?

Well, that can't be right.

No one's ever done that before.

Except me because I just did it!

âª Sheldon and his brain, yeah âª

âª Sheldon and his brain, yeah! âª

I've made a horrible mistake.

What are you talking about?

This table,
it's in square centimeters.

I read it as square meters.

You know what that means?

That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

But the Chinese team
found the element.

Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

My calculations were wrong.

The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

is based on a blunder.

I'm not a genius.

I'm a fraud.

You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

that we thought was
someplace else.

Oh, great,
now I'm worse than a fraud.

I'm practically a biologist.

This is Science Friday.
I'm Ira Flatow.

My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

stable super-heavy element.

Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Thank you.

The university made me come here.

I didn't want to.

Big fan of the show.

So, I understand
that you actually discovered

this element by mistake.

(SIGHS)

Yes.

And some people in the science
community are calling it

"The Wonder Blunder."

Who?
Give me their names.

I bet it's Wolowitz.

It's just such a fascinating story.

Your calculations are way off,

but they find the element anyway.

It's like misreading
a treasure map

and still finding the treasure.

Can we talk
about something else?

Do you know that I yodel?

That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

And in Chemistry, no less.

And wouldn't that be unusual?

Because you're a physicist.

Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in Chemistry.

Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

It is because of bullies like you,

every day more and more Americans

are making the switch to television.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

You're the one who
made me go on the radio.

I was expecting a professional
science interview,

not an attack by some
morning zoo shock jock.

Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

perhaps you should
start a swear jar.

Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

I know you don't like it,

but every time
you do an interview,

it raises the profile
of the university.

That translates to funding.

Yeah, well, I'm not just

some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

Of course you're not.

People love trained monkeys.

How can you not be happy?

You're tall, thin and famous.

Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

Look, you're going to be
doing this stuff for a while.

You're just going to have to find
a way to get used to it.

But none of you know
what this is like.

Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

You clearly haven't been with me
at Mardi Gras.

Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

I am cleaning up.

Look at the mess the Joker
made of Gotham City.

Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

Raj grew up in India.

Trust me, he's seen worse.

Howie.

I promise I'll help out
the rest of the week.

The rest of the week?

You said it was just
going to be a night or two.

Yeah, but if I told you a week,
would you have said yes?

- No!
- Then you left me no choice.

I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

I know,
but they're tenting his building.

He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

- He's bringing Cinnamon?
- For a whole week!

The nerve of some people.

Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

With stops at Fraudville...

...WonderBlunderberg...

...and Kansas City.

Because it's a hub.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

AMY: Sheldon, can I come in?

- Do you have cookies?
- No.

Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

Wil?

Hey, Sheldon.
It's been a while.

Why are you here?

Amy said you were
having a rough time,

and I thought maybe we could talk.

Is that okay?

Certainly.

Although... right now,
I'm having a rough time

because there's
three people in my room,

and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

for something you wished
you never did.

Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

Oh, nonsense, Wil.

Your endless tweets
are not that bad.

I remember why it's been a while.

Sheldon, I was actually talking

about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

How could you not
like getting attention

for playing Wesley Crusher?

You were wonderful.

A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

Who couldn't relate to that?

Well, not everybody felt that way.

A lot of people
really hated the character,

and some of them
hated me because of it.

I would do interviews,

and people would be mean to me.

That just happened to me.

Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

feel free to say
what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

that part of his life and
moved on to bigger and better things.

Yeah, I'm an author now,

I do public speaking,

and I have my own web series
about board games.

We're trying to cheer him up, so...

I'm just saying
that there was a time

when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

But now, it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

I do see what you're saying.

That helps.

Good.

Would you two like to stay
and play trains with me?

- Sure.
- Okay.

Oh, great!

Now... I work the controls.

I say "All aboard."

You sit quietly and watch.

Can I blow the whistle?

You should probably go.

You're going to brush
your teeth on my couch?

No, I'm going to brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

Why bother?

She spends half the time
licking her butt.

And the other half
licking my face.

That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

- Did you already have dinner?
- No, we were waiting for you.

That's so sweet.

Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

Howard, the poor thing
just got home from work.

Let me get you a glass of wine.

I'll cook dinner.

- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
- Don't be silly.

Sit.
You look like you've had a long day.

No, she always looks like that.

Because she married an idiot.

Thank you, Raj.

Please, this is my way
of thanking you

for letting me stay here.

Now, tell us all about your day.

Okay, well, first,

I was late to a meeting
because I was stuck in traffic.

I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

from eating too many jelly beans,
did I tell you how to fix it?

No.

I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

I thought of you the whole time.

All I'm saying is
there's a time to just listen.

Thank you.

There's also a time to stop
eating too many jelly beans.

And it's when you're ten.

Hello, President Siebert.

Thank you for taking my call.

I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

No, no, no, no.

No need to thank me.

Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

For your information,
I have nine friends.

Ten if we include you.

Nine it is.

Eh, it's ten.
I'll count Wolowitz.

- Hello, friend Leonard.
- Hey, you're in a good mood.

I'm in a great mood.

Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure, but...

I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

and I disproved it.

Your element does not exist!

Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

They found it.

Yeah, it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files.

They faked the results.

Really?

Yes!
Do you know what that means?

It means that all of this
attention that you hate goes away.

- So no more interviews?
- No, it's all over.

- I can't believe it.
- Well, you're welcome.

You robbed me
of my greatest achievement!

What?!

I'm back down to nine friends!

Make it eight.
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

I don't understand.

All you've done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain.

I was trying to make you happy!

By taking away
my only claim to fame?

Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

you could have told me a joke.

Or shown me a cute video
of a koala and an otter

becoming unlikely friends.

There is no winning with you.

And koalas and otters
don't even live near each other!

That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

Hey!
What's with all the yelling?

Leonard disproved my element.

Now all the attention
is going to go away.

Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

He's counting Hobbits
and superheroes, right?

When I thought the element was real,
I didn't want it.

But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

I want it more
than anything in the world.

(STAMMERS) The element
never existed.

I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

Be mad at science.

Don't you dare use
science against me.

Science is my best friend!

Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.

Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

Actually, I get what he's saying.

Yes! Nine!

Welcome back, buddy.

It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

and then they break up with you

and then you want them
more than ever.

I have no idea what
she's talking about.

But we're ganging up on you
so I agree.

Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

hide the information?

If I don't publish it,
it's just a matter of time

before someone else does.

No, no, of course
you have to publish.

That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

You have no choice.

Fine, I'll publish.

Can you believe this guy?

Oh, Raj did the dishes.

How do you know
I didn't do them?

Because once,
when all the knives were dirty,

you cut a bagel with your keys.

Good morning, everybody.

I picked up coffee
while I was out.

Bernadette,
here's your soy peppermint mocha.

You didn't have to do that.

Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

about your presentation today.

You're going to be great.

Yeah, you're going to
knock it out of the park.

What presentation do I have today?

Just go.

He loves you.

What are you doing?

Are you trying
to make me look bad?

I'm just being
a good house guest.

No, you're being
a better husband than I am.

Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

knowing about her life?

Who does that?

Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

I don't want coffee.

That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

Give me that.

Just stop showing me up.

Howard, listen to me.

You're a great husband.

Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

But it's amazing
how far you've come

given that you're an only child
raised by an over-protective mom.

Is this getting weird?

Hang on.

Oh, yes.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
LEONARD: Hey.

I just wanted to let you know
that I posted my findings.

I saw.

And I just posted
a retraction of my paper.

Now the whole scientific community
knows I was wrong.

These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

Not to me.

The only other retraction
I ever had to issue

was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother

was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

But that was just a ploy
to get my face out of his armpit.

(SPEAKS WITH IMPEDIMENT)
There he is!

It's my favorite superhero,

the Retractor!

Come on,
don't give him a hard time.

I'm sorry, Cooper.

I retract it.

By the way, Hofstadter,

nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

It's not a big deal.

It's a huge deal.

Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

That way you could take
things back for a living.

Okay, Barry, that's enough.

Oh, no, that's okay.

I can fight my own battles.

Isn't that right, "Bawwy"?

Is...?

Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

That's pretty hurtful.

I...

I can't control it.

You're right,

that was uncalled for.

I take it back.

Of course you do.

Because you're the Retractor!

Raj, this dinner was amazing.

If you're here much longer,

I'm going to have
to buy bigger clothes.

Nonsense.

You need a little fattening up.

You've been looking
too skinny lately.

Aww.

Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

What are you talking about?

Remember last week,
when I asked you

if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

How's that different?

Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

like your friend Raj.

Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

He packed me
a lunch this morning.

And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get them."

Like I don't do enough around here.

Now I need to pack your lunch?

And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

to go get them?
You're a grown man!

You should know to "go get them!"

I do know to "go get them,"

but sometimes
it's nice to have emotional support

when I'm going and getting them!

Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

Let's just, you know, all calm down
and take a step back.

This is stupid.
Why are we fighting?

I don't know.

I guess I was just feeling
like I'm a lousy husband.

You're not a lousy husband.

You're a great husband.

I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

Are you kidding?
You're the best.

I know what the problem is.

It's him!

Oh, what did I do?

You made us feel like
we're not trying hard enough.

Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

till you showed up.

Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

but I just have to say
it's nice to see

the two of you on the same page.

Oh, it does feel good

to have you backing me up for once.

- I back you up all the time!
- That is not...

- He's doing it again!
- What is wrong with you?!

I can't believe they kicked you out.

I can't believe
they're still married.

Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

I have two words for you:

Jurassic Park.

This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

- It probably won't.
- You're probably right.

Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk together?

Oh, everything is just
sex with you isn't it?

Sheldon, I think
you might find the support

you're looking for, if you realize

that relationships
are a give and take.

She can only be there for you

as much as you are for her.

Thank you, Rajesh.

And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

instead of pressuring him
to accept intimacy on your terms.

You should probably go.

I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

who thought he had discovered

a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

Welcome to Science Friday,
gentlemen.

- Thanks.
- Thank you.

Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last week.

It's all right.

Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

No.

Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

Can you walk us
through the process

you used to disprove his theory?

- Well...
- I believe I can answer that.

He asked me.

Fine.

As I was saying...

You're telling it wrong.
Ira...

...to really understand the story here,

you have to start
at the very beginning.

A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

- Sheldon...
- That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

leading to his first
scientific breakthrough,

the doggie death-ray.

Which, sadly, he couldn't build

because Santa wouldn't bring
him enriched uranium.

You know, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

if it's okay with you.

What a surprise.

Did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

Actually, I didn't invite you.

You came in, you took a seat,

and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

LEONARD: Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

SHELDON: Well, that seems
like a snooze.

Even for public radio.

You know,
if we did a shot every time

they said something embarrassing,

this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

SHELDON: You know, I don't just say
smart things about science.

I also yodel.

âª (SHELDON YODELING) âª

I'll get the vodka.

(English US - SDH)

MAN (OVER COMPUTER): In the lead,
the left-side competitor.

Wow, you're really good at this.

Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

I'm like a pyramid.

How you doing over there?

Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

I cannot walk into that ER

with another video game injury.

Hey, Sheldon,
you want to play next?

Oh, I would,
but I'm on my way out.

- Where?
- Texas.

Right now? Why?

- Is someone sick?
- Yes.

My sister's uterus came
down with a baby.

Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

You're gone an uncle...
Uncle Sheldon.

No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

How come you never said
she was pregnant?

Well, I never told you
about my brother's kidney stone.

You want to hear about everything

that comes out
of my family's genitals?

Well, congrats, and it's nice

you're gonna be
there for your sister.

Yes. I'm filling in for her
husband who's recovering

from a horrible motorcycle accident.

Lucky duck.

Wow, so, how long will you be gone?

Well, she's due tomorrow.

Although it did take her
six years to finish high school,

so who knows?

Can I give you a ride to the airport?

Oh, no, thank you, I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

Chop-chop, Leonard.
We leave in ten minutes.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS) âª

All right, here's the deal.

Sheldon is gone, so the tree
decorating rules are out the window.

Yeah, which means
we don't have to use

his ridiculous
ornament-spacing template.

And I'm happy to report
its Kickstarter campaign

is holding strong at zero dollars.

Wait, so Star Wars
and Star Trek characters

can go on the same branch?

I know, it's crazy.

Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!

ALL: Woo!

I've never done this before.
It's kind of fun.

Yeah, if your mom could see
her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

she'd have a heart attack.

Good idea, I'll take a picture.

Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

so for Christmas I was
thinking of giving you...

...this.

I love it.

Okay.

But it is what you got me last year.

- Yeah.
- And last night.

(KNOCKING) Hello.

Hi, Stuart.

Oh, good, I'm glad you guys
didn't wait for me to start.

Although you said 7:00
and it's 7:00. That's fine.

(RINGING)

Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

Hi, Sheldon.

Everybody's here, say hi.

- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.

Hey.

- Howdy.
- Hi.

Hello.

SHELDON: The second
I go out of town

you throw a Christmas
party without me?

Yeah, kind of.

That's so thoughtful.
You guys are the best.

Hey, how's your sister?

She went into labor an hour ago.

That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

No, she chose to have a home
birth... because she wants

to live in the Stone Age
and a cave wasn't available.

You know, many people believe

that home births are better
because the mother

is in a warm, comfortable environment

where she can be
nurtured by loved ones.

And turn the bedroom floor

into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

WOMAN: Shelly, come on!

Your sister's fully dilated

and she wants
a nice family picture

before there's blood everywhere!

SHELDON: Oh, boy.

I picked the wrong day
to wear my good robot T-shirt.

(BEEPING)

If you were having Sheldon's baby

would you really want him
in the room?

Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

I'll give you ten dollars.

Hey, I brought over
It's a Wonderful Life

if you guys want to watch it later.

- Oh, I love that movie.
- I've never seen it.

- Me neither.
- It's great.

It's Christmas time and
Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

and he's gonna jump
off a bridge and kill himself...

Don't need to see it.
Living it.

But then he gets to see
what the world

would be like
if he'd never been born.

Hey, you ever imagine
what that would be like?

Not being born?

(KNOCKING) What do you think?

What do you think?

You make jokes about Sheldon,

but if it weren't for him,

I don't think any of us would be
sitting in this room right now.

Really? Sheldon not being here

is the main reason I'm in this room.

It's true.

None of you would know me.

You wouldn't know Bernadette.

- You wouldn't be dating Penny.
- You don't know that.

I've been going to the
Cheesecake Factory for years.

I could have picked her up.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, you weren't joking.

No.

Okay, sweetie, let me tell you

exactly how that
would have gone down.

I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk
out of my nipples.

Sorry, I thought we're saying things
that are never gonna happen.

Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.

Watch me.

Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

- (STAMMERING)
- A few minutes it is.

You didn't ask her out,
but that was a lot of sounds.

You guys are making me nervous.

Fine, then go talk to her
on your own.

I will.

- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

Hi... I'm Leonard?

Really? You don't sound so sure.

No, I am he.

Anyway...

There's been something I've wanted
to ask you for a long time.

What's that?

I was wondering,
if you're not too busy...

...if you'd be interested in...

...telling me where the restroom is?

I think you're too late.

Come on, I would not
have peed my pants.

- She nailed it.
- Sounds about right.

But, you forget,
I did ask you out in real life.

Which couldn't have happened
if you didn't live across the hall from her

which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

Same goes with you guys.

If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

she never would have set you up.

Doesn't matter.
Bernadette still would've been working

at The Cheesecake Factory,

and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

You would've been all over me.

Well...

Hey, Penny, can I take that table?

Sure, why?

The one in the turtleneck is cute.

Open wide,
here comes the happy train.

Mm-hm...
Chug-a chug-a, yum, yum.

Hang on.

You got a...
You got a little something.

Never mind.

- (LAUGHING)
- Oh, man, that is so us.

You know, maybe you and I
wouldn't be together,

but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

- Why?
- Because I know exactly

the kind of guy you
would've ended up with.

Hey, babe.

Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

Better. I used the money
to buy these magic beans.

He may be an idiot, but at least
he didn't pee himself.

Hold on.

Aw, babe, I peed myself.

(GASPS) Me, too.

The end.

(RINGING)

Hi, Sheldon.

Everything okay?

No, it's not.

I've seen things.

Lady things.

Listen to me.

That is not the way
they usually look.

It doesn't matter.

This is no way
to make new humans.

People coming out of people.

It's some kind of dirty magic show.

WOMAN: Sheldon Lee Cooper.

You get back
in this room right now.

And bring a mop.

Did you hear that?

A mop.

I have two PhDs yet
somehow I'm the janitor

of my sister's birth canal.

Hey, Sheldon sent us all
an e-mail.

"Happy holidays from Texas."

And there's pictures.

Ah! Don't open them.
Do not open them.

Oh, come on.
Childbirth is a natural, beautiful...

Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

My father's a gynecologist,
I think I can handle it.

And, now I'm gay.

You know, I was thinking,

without Sheldon most of us
would have never met,

but Penny would still
live across from him.

And with Leonard out of the picture,

we all know what that would mean.

We do?

(FLIRTATIOUSLY) Hey, Sheldon.

Hello.

Doing laundry?

Of course I'm doing laundry.

Saturday night is laundry night,

and I'm in a laundry room, so...

I believe your inference is justified.

(LAUGHING)
My inference is justified.

Sheldon, you are so funny.

Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too,

because these clothes are so dirty.

Almost as dirty as the dirty girl
who's wearing them.

Okay, that's enough.

- Disagree.
- Keep going.

So, what do you think?

A tad asymmetrical,
but nothing to be concerned about.

Please, Sheldon. I need you.

To... what?

To take me.

I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

Penny, for the thousandth time,

I'm saving myself
for someone special.

Perhaps a cute
bespectacled neuroscientist

with hair the color of mud.

I think I know how
to change your mind.

- That's enough.
- (GROANING IN DISGUST)

I was okay with it.

(RINGING)

How's it going, Sheldon?

Actually, much better.

Oh, good.
Is the baby born yet?

I don't know.
I just got back.

Where'd you go?

My mother asked me
to get some towels.

I took advantage
of the vague request

and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

So rude.

Here's another one.
Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon,

you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

Great.

At least Leonard, Howard and I
would have always been friends.

Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

We talked about it,
but Howard was in

a pretty serious
relationship with his mom.

I lived with her to save money.

Yeah, you didn't have
to buy groceries

because you were breast-feeding.

So I guess if it weren't for me,

you'd still be living with her, huh?

Not exactly.

What do you mean, not exactly?

Well, things would be
a little different.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, where's my lunch? I'm starving!

I know you're starving.
The neighbors know you're starving.

There's starving people in Africa
who know you're starving!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: That's it?
There's not enough food!

HOWARD: Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

How is this any different?

You didn't let me finish.

Here you go, Mother.

FEMALE VOICE:
You're a good boy, Howard!

Such a good boy!

Wait, did she die
or did you kill her?

Tomato, tomahto.
The important thing is she's dead.

Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

This guy wanted
a place of his own

because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

Yeah, I was wrong.

But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

Come on, Leonard, dinner.

Coming.

LEONARD: Hang on.

Why would I be fat?

You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

you'd try to fill the void
with food,

and I'm an enabler who once
deep-fried a pancake.

Why can't you be fat too?

What do you want
to do for dessert?

I think there's still
half a cake from breakfast.

No, there's not.

Hey, guys.

BOTH: Stuart!

What are you doing?

I... (CLEARS THROAT)

...just wanted to be
in anyone's story.

Yeah, but why are you fat?

Because Leonard was fat.

Amy, what about you?

What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

It's hard to say,

my life would be so... different.

You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

I don't know.

âª (SINGING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY") âª

âª There's tears in the frosting âª

âª (CONTINUES SINGING) âª

(HIGH-PITCHED TONE)

I'll stop now.

(RINGING)

How's it going, Sheldon?

(PANTING) That's it.

The baby's here.

It's a boy.

(ALL CHEERING) Congrats.

Oh, thank you.

I wasn't sure I was
going to make it.

But my mother
gave me some ice chips,

my sister told me to breathe.

And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,

if you can make it through
the Green Lantern movie,

you can make it through this."

Well, good for you, buddy.

We'll let you get back in there.

No, no, I'm not
going back in there.

That baby is so irritating.

He has literally been crying
his entire life.

Oh, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

- Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
- Why?

Well, you always
complain that you never

had an intelligent
role model growing up,

and now you can
be one for your nephew.

(SIGHS) All right, I'll go.

But from what I've seen,
his attention span

is as limited as his bladder control.

(BEEPING)

You actually got him to do it.

Yeah, you keep saying how much
Sheldon has affected all of us,

but you've clearly
had an impact on him.

If that were true,
I wouldn't still be living alone.

Well, not exactly alone.

I do have a 50 pound sack of rice

with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.

I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

I wish I could believe you.

I also wish there wasn't a mouse
living in Rice Sheldon.

Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little
early Christmas present.

I'm gonna show you something,
but if you ever told Sheldon,

he'd probably never
speak to me again.

So, if you want to tell him,
that's fine.

Look.

I don't understand.

He made you his screensaver.

Oh.

Wow.

I had no idea.

(EXCITED) He is so into me.

Wait, wait, where'd I go?

Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,

Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man...
but, look, you're in the mix.

I am in the mix.
And I'm the hottest one.

Who's that?

- Oh, Madame Curie.
- That's fine, she's dead.

You okay?

Just really glad you're back.

SHELDON: Me, too.

I got a lot of TV to catch up on.

I missed you.

To quote Han Solo, "I know."

Did you miss me?

I would've preferred
to have you there with me.

Oh...

Or instead of me.

Did you hold the baby?

- I did.
- And?

How did it make you feel?

Looking into the blank, innocent eyes

of a creature that couldn't begin to
comprehend anything I was saying?

Basically just another day
at the office.

I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

Put up or shut up.
You make it, I'll drink it.

You guys need anything else?

Your phone number
and one more cheesecake.

I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

In fact, there he is now.

Ready to go, sweetheart?

Not until I get my kiss.

(GIGGLING)

(SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING)

(SIGHS)

(English US - SDH)

This is nice,
that we all get to eat together.

Absolutely.

Can we maybe put the phones down and
have an actual human conversation?

We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs,
we don't have to.

Guys. Guys,
you're never gonna believe this.

- What happened?
- I just got a part on a TV show!

- That's great!
- Congratulations!

- Guys!
- Oh, yeah!

- Yay, Penny!
- What's the show?

NCII, or, you know, NCSTD...

I don't know, it's...

It's the one with all the letters
and I'm gonna be on it!

- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

- What's your part?
- I play a customer in a diner

and I flirt with Mark Harmon.

Ooh, Mark Harmon,
he's a dreamboat.

- So it's just flirting?
- Well, yeah. Why?

No reason. I just think it's sexier

when things are left
to the imagination.

He's wrong.

âª (THEME SONG) âª

So I read a study that
says a man with a dog

is three times more likely
to get a woman's phone number.

Is it true even when
the man lets his dog

lick peanut butter off his tongue?

I don't see why not.

If you're really desperate
to meet women

and like having food
eaten out of your mouth,

I could set you up with my mom.

Why is that funny?

That's just unhygienic.

- It's a joke.
- I don't think so.

I believe that a joke
is a brief oral narrative

with a climactic humorous twist.

For example,
Wolowitz's mother is so fat

that she decided
to go on a diet,

or exercise, or both.

See? The twist is that people
don't usually change.

Well, they don't.

Hey, guys, don't forget,
my episode's on TV tomorrow night.

- We'll be there.
- Can we bring anything?

Oh, that's so sweet of you,
but I was gonna steal food from here.

You know, my treat.

Wait, if Howard's mother is coming,
then you should also steal marbles.

Because she's obese,
and hippos are obese,

and in the popular board game Hungry
Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles.

Maybe I need to dumb
these down for you.

- Leonard, do you think I'm funny?
- No.

- Do you?
- I think I'm hysterical.

I take it back.
That was funny.

The philosopher Henri Bergson
says it's funny

when a human being
behaves like an object.

I bet that bit killed
at The Chuckle Hut.

Oh, he didn't perform stand-up
comedy, he was a philosopher.

You know, I think
we're zeroing in on your problem.

Perhaps I'll spend some time

developing a unified
theory of comedy,

which will allow me to elicit
laughter from anyone at any time.

Unless they're German,
'cause that's a tough crowd.

Are you set on people
laughing with you?

'Cause if you're cool with at you...

I don't get it.

Raj, when you said you
were gonna bring a date

to watch Penny's thing tonight,
I didn't think you meant Stuart.

Really? I never for a second
thought it'd be anything else.

I almost met someone last night,
but I blew it.

I was walking Cinnamon
and this girl introduced herself,

but she was so cute I panicked
and said,

"Wouldn't it be easier
if instead of talking

we could just sniff
each other's butts?"

Well, Stuart's cute in his own way.

When I was a baby, my mother
called me her little possum.

- Are possums cute?
- Not at all.

If you're so intimidated
by talking to attractive girls,

maybe you should practice
by talking to regular people.

You mean like fatties and uggos?

Or maybe just stop talking.

I'm serious. Go to the mall,
talk to anybody, practice.

That way, when you eventually
do talk to a cute girl,

- it won't be so scary.
- Or just keep dating the possum.

MAN ON TV: Parsa doesn't haVe
those kind of resources.

No, and that's why he had
Erin Pace rewire it...

I'm so proud of you.

We haven't even
gotten to my scene yet.

I know, but you're going to be a TV
star and you haven't left me yet.

That takes guts.

I don't know about you, but I'm
very uncomfortable with all this.

- Why?
- I've never seen this show before

and now I'm starting
with episode 246?

It's unnatural.

Just think of the first 245
as the prequel.

All right.

Okay, shh.
Guys, guys, this is it.

I guess it's you and me, kid.

- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to make peace.

- We're good.
- Good.

- Are you kidding me?
- What's wrong?

Well, the diner scene.
Where's my diner scene?

Don't ask me. Until I see
the prequel, I'm lost.

No, there was supposed to be
a big scene with me and Mark Harmon,

but it's... gone.

- What happened?
- They must've cut it.

Oh, Penny.

I'm... I'm sorry.

- That stinks.
- I'm sure you were great.

This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I...

I thought I did
a really good job, I...

Excuse me.

I've been studying how
to make people laugh.

They say that comedy
is tragedy plus time.

- Let's tickle some ribs.
- No!

No, Dad, I don't think they
cut me out of the show

because I was too pretty.

No, I don't need you to come out
and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

Daddy, I gotta go.
I love you. Bye.

- How you doing?
- (GROANS) This is such a disaster.

My parents had all my relatives over.

They got one of those
six-foot sandwiches,

and got my brother
a day pass out of rehab and...

...now he's missing
and the sandwich is missing, and...

They're probably in Mexico by now.
So humiliating.

You still got the part.
That's a huge accomplishment.

But this was supposed
to be my break, okay?

People were gonna
see me in this show

and it was gonna
lead to bigger things.

More auditions, more parts.
Now none of that's gonna happen.

Honey, you only had three lines.
That wasn't gonna happen anyway.

- Unbelievable.
- Oh, come on.

- That's not what I meant.
- Then what did you mean?

I don't... You know, words don't
always have to mean things.

I think you meant
that you don't believe in me.

Nope. Uh-uh. I might not
know what I meant,

but I know that
I didn't mean that.

Not this guy. Oh, no way.

I want you, right now, to give me
your 100 percent honest opinion.

Do you think I have what it takes
to really make it as an actress?

- Yes.
- So you think I'll be on TV

and in movies and win awards.

- Honestly?
- Yes, honestly.

- I don't.
- How could you say that?

I don't know... I got all confused
when you said "honestly."

Oh!

Look, do I think
that you are talented

and that you are beautiful?
Of course I do.

But isn't Los Angeles
full of actresses

who are just as talented,
just as beautiful?

Look, we'll come back to that.

No, please. Don't stop, go on.

Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

That is not what I said.
Look, I think you're really good.

I truly do.

But this is an incredibly hard thing
that you're shooting for.

I mean, the odds of anyone
becoming a successful actor

- are like a million to one.
- Wow, thank you.

Should've let Sheldon come.

This is interesting.

Apparently, a key component
in some forms of humor

- is the element of surprise.
- Well, that makes sense.

The prefrontal cortex
is responsible

for planning and anticipation,

- and patients with brain lesions...
- Brain lesions!

Sheldon, you scared me.
That wasn't funny.

Or maybe you have a stick
up your prefrontal cortex.

Okay, the notion that you can
read a few books and come up

with a definitive theory
of comedy is absurd.

I mean, humor is
a complex neurological...

- Okay, that's pretty good.
- Excellent.

- How about her?
- No! No pretty girls!

The point is to talk
to regular people

and work our way up
to pretty girls.

Fine.

How about that old lady
with the walker?

That depends. On any level,
do you think she's hot?

We'll find somebody else.

Kumquat?

I guess.

Ointment?

Sure.

Now, would you say ointment

is more, equal to,
or less funny than kumquat?

I don't think I want
to go out with you anymore.

Would you please stop joking around?
I'm trying to figure this out.

Sheldon, how many words
are you gonna go through?

All of them.

You didn't get your part cut.

And you didn't get your part cut.

Yep, bunch of old guys
rocking out in a band,

all with erectile dysfunction,
you didn't get your part cut!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey. Can we talk?

We can, but the part
of Penny might get cut.

That was really crappy of me.

What you're trying to do is hard,
but people do make it,

and I really do believe
you could be one of them.

Thank you.

And... to show you how much
I believe in you,

I kind of got you an audition.

Are you serious? For what?

- The new Star Wars movie.
- What?!

- How did you manage that?
- There's this thing online,

you put yourself on tape and just
send it in, anyone can do it.

Come on, Leonard,
this is just a PR stunt.

So? Even if it is,
you have a huge advantage

because you're an actual actress.

Most of the people doing this
are just weirdoes and nerds.

Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.

- Really, let it go.
- Look, maybe it is a long shot,

but sometimes long shots happen.

Luke Skywalker was only given one
chance to destroy the Death Star.

He had to get a torpedo
into an exhaust port

that was only two meters wide,
but with the help of The Force, he...

Wow, I can feel you
hating me right now.

How about that lady
in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

Yeah, she seems friendly
and easy to...

Never mind, she's gone.

Maybe talking
to people is too hard.

We could go over to that department
store, practice on the mannequins.

I don't know.
They're dressed very stylishly.

They're probably stuck-up.

This is ridiculous.

The next person that walks by,
no matter who it is, they're the one.

We're gonna die here.

- Hello.
- Hey.

- Where's Sheldon?
- He's home trying to use science

to determine the basis of humor.

- That's interesting.
- It's exhausting.

Do you have any idea how hard it is

to laugh at a knock-knock
joke that starts with,

"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,
knock-knock-knock, Amy,

knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

If you want him to stop,

sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.

Fake a laugh?

- Do you ever do that with me?
- No, of course not.

Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.

I don't think you would.

Please, I've made
plenty of girls laugh,

sometimes just by
asking them out.

Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.

Yes, how much for a hundred
long-stemmed, red roses?

Really?

How much for three?

- Hey.
- Yeah, I'll call you back.

Look, I know you were
just trying to help

with your Star Wars thing.
I didn't mean to call it idiotic.

Well, I don't think
you called it idiotic.

Oh. Sorry, I meant to.

Anyway... I was just upset
with myself. I wasn't mad at you.

I just feel like everything
is falling apart.

- Come on. It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

Look at me, okay? I took a temp job
as a waitress forever ago,

and I'm still doing it.
I can't quit, because guess what?

I can't do anything else.

And I finally get my big break,
and it goes away! I'm such a mess.

- No, you're not.
- Really?

'Cause this morning at Starbucks,

a pair of old underwear
fell out of my pant leg!

And it wasn't the only
one in there.

Okay, listen to me,
this is just a minor setback.

No, it's not, okay? I've been out
here for, like, ten years!

- I've nothing to show for it!
- Well, you have me.

You're right.

I do have you.

Mmm.

Let's get married.

What?

Whoo.

Leonard Hofstadter,
will you marry me?

Um...

Did you seriously
just say, "Um"?

Look, you know I love you,

but you're... you're drunk
and sad and feeling lost...

Okay, so you don't
want to marry me?!

- That is not what I said.
- No, forget it! I take it back!

- Offer's off the table!
- Who's in the mood to laugh?!

Really not a good time.

But I used science
to construct the perfect joke.

- I'm gonna go.
- Penny, don't.

No, no, I just need to be alone.

So, a sandwich, a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar.

- Where are you going?
- To my room.

- Should I follow you?
- No.

- Leonard, wait.
- What?

I forgot to tell you
the sandwich is promiscuous.

How about those guys on that bench
over there? They look pathetic.

I bet we could talk to them.

That's a mirror.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, fellas, mall's closing.

- Sorry.
- Yeah. Good night.

- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

Do you like being
a mall security guard?

- It's all right.
- Okay, nice talking to you.

Smooth!

- Can't sleep?
- No.

Would you like to talk about it?

Penny proposed,
and I didn't say yes.

- Why not?
- That's a good question.

Does that mean the
relationship is over?

I don't know.

Why don't you ask her?

Because I'm afraid
to know the answer.

Well... I'm sorry.

That's it? You're not
gonna make some dumb joke

or some inappropriate comment?

No.

You're my friend, and... I'm sorry.

Did you just put
a "kick me" sign on my back?

No.

That wouldn't be funny at all.

Star Wars audition, take one.

Starring Howard Joel Wolowitz,
real-life astronaut.

Vader is here,

now, on this moon.

I felt his presence.

He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near...

BERNADETTE: How many times
do I have to tell you

to replace the toilet paper
when it's empty?!

- I'm in the middle of something!
- So am I!

PENNY:
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

- This is just a minor setback.
- No, it's not, okay?

I've been out here for,
like, ten years.

- I have nothing to show for it.
- Well, you have me.

I do have you.

Mmm.

Leonard Hofstadter,

will you marry me?

Um...

Did you seriously just say... umm?

- It's an outrage.
- I know.

The university, they think
they can do whatever they want.

We just have to sit
there and take it.

You need to let it go, Sheldon.

You work tirelessly for someone
and this is what you get.

Oh, my God! They're just making
you use your vacation days!

But I don't want a vacation.

Okay, listen, I don't mean to
diminish what you're going through,

but I'm a little
distracted right now.

Oh, this again?

So, Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

and now you think you may
have lost her love forever.

How does this compare to me being
forced to relax for a few days?

- It doesn't!
- Thank you!

I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

curl up with a good book and wait
for this nightmare to be over.

(EXHALES)

Penny.

Sorry.

- Hi.
- Hey.

Look, I'm sorry I
didn't text you back.

I just needed
some time to think.

- Okay.
- Here. Come in.

Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

- Leonard...
- No, no, no. I take it back.

Don't say it.
Just hate me, but stay with me.

It worked for my parents.

Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

Oh. Okay.

Good, good.

So it's cool if I cry a little?

- Yeah, I probably wouldn't.
- Yeah.

Look, you did the right thing
last night. I was a mess.

I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

Look, I get it,
and I want you to know

that I support
whatever you want to do.

Great, because
I've been thinking,

if I really want this
acting thing to work,

I need to focus all my energy on it.
And to do that,

I should quit waitressing
at The Cheesecake Factory.

Wow.

- That's a big step.
- I know.

So, you know, before
making any rash...

- I already quit.
- And I support you.

âª (THEME SONG) âª

Come on, take me
to work with you.

No. You're on vacation.

Please? What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

and I'm not there to see it?

Do you really think
there's gonna be a breakthrough

- without you there to do it?
- No. I was just tricking you.

Bye.

Leonard, wait!

- Take me with you.
- No!

- Please.
- No!

- Too bad. I'm coming with you.
- Sheldon, stay!

- But...
- I said stay!

I'm going to work.

Do not follow me.

(WHIMPERS)

(SIGHS)

BERNADETTE: Hey, Stuart.

- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I startle you?

Yes, but at this point, pretty
much any customer does.

- What can I do for you?
- Well, I need a little help.

I accidentally destroyed one of
Howard's comic books this morning,

- and was hoping I could replace it.
- Wow. What happened?

Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

Don't let The Riddler know that.

It's a comic book joke.

Or maybe it's not.

- Do you have this one?
- Well, it's pretty rare.

Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

I was kind of hoping to get it
before Howie comes home from work.

- What's the hurry?
- Well, he's always saying

I should be more careful
with my curling iron,

and it seems like
a dangerous precedent

to let him think he can be right.

Well, I'll do what I can,
but I can't make any promises.

You know, I do work
at a pharmaceutical company.

If you can make this happen today,

I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

Really.

Do you have any of these?

Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

Not so bitey without the rest of the
rat to back us up now, are we?

- (TAPS ON DOOR)
- Anybody home?

Hey, what brings you guys here?

Well, we were just on our way
to lunch and wanted to see

- if you'd like to join.
- Why?

Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

and you don't think I
have any other options?

I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had any company.

That's okay.
Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh.

Guys, this is Bert.

- Hey. Good to see you.
- Hey.

Anyway, I wanted to show you

this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

This is so pretty.

Bert works for the
geology department.

Yeah. You know what geologists
and Bon Jovi have in common?

You're both into rock?

Yeah.

- Well, see ya.
- You forgot your quartz.

Oh, it's okay.
I want you to have it.

Bye.

He's nice.

Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

What?

- No, he doesn't.
- He brought you a pretty rock.

So? He does that every day...
Oh.

You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

and hang out with your boyfriend,
Bert, it's totally okay.

He's not my boyfriend.

Are you sure?
He's tall, pale and awkward.

That sounds like your type.

Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

What do I do?
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

I guess it hasn't come up.

There you go.

And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

- Oh, hey, Sheldon.
- (DEJECTEDLY) Hello.

You okay?

I'm on vacation.
What do you think?

Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

Leonard told me to stay.

Oh.

Well, good boy.

- Where are you going?
- I have a ton of errands to run.

I need to make copies of my
headshot, send them off to agents

and sign up for a new
acting class.

- Well, have fun.
- Okay.

(WHIMPERS SOFTLY)

- You want to come with me?
- Really?

Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

Get in the car. Come on.

All right, thanks a lot.

They have one at Capital Comics.

- That's great.
- No, it's not. I hate that place.

Guy who owns it is a jerk.

He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

That's terrible.

What's the address?

You know, why don't I
just take you there?

That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

Thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

I mean, won't you lose business?

Sorry. That was mean.

Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

- Yeah.
- So what is she doing today?

I don't know. She already
thinks I don't support this,

so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

- Well, do you support this?
- Of course I do.

She's a great actress.
I'm proud she's taking this risk.

- That's nice.
- You bought that? Great!

I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

Hey.

- Hi. What's up?
- How's it going?

You taking Hollywood by storm?

Actually,
I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

You got your job back.
That is great news.

I didn't want to say anything,
but you are making the right choice.

To plunge yourself into debt right
now would be literally insane.

Yeah. I'm just
returning my uniform.

And I support you.

MAN: Before we begin your
guided meditation,

close your eyes and picture
yourself in a peaceful environment.

Okay.

I'm inside the CERN super collider.

Now, take a deep, relaxing
breath in through your nose.

And let it out.

Wow. Didn't see that coming.

In.

Let me guess.

And out.

What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

- Where's my lemonade?
- I didn't get it.

A fitting swan song
to your career as a waitress

to forget my order one last time.

Do you think quitting
my job was a mistake?

Do you see me drinking lemonade?

No. I'm serious.

Why do you ask?

Because Leonard just pissed me off.

Am I being an idiot or not?

No, I don't think you are.

Really?

The best way to achieve
a goal is to devote 100 percent

of your time and energy to it.

When I decided I was
going to be a physicist,

I didn't take some other job
in case it didn't work out.

Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

from Ms. Pierson for me
to be chalk monitor that year.

Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

Why can't Leonard understand it?

Because he's not like us, Penny.

We're dreamers.

Yeah, I need to start cracking the
window when I leave you in the car.

Hey.

Hello, Bert.

So, anyway, there's this big
rock and mineral show

next week in Santa Monica and...

Listen... Bert, before you
say anything else, I...

I have a boyfriend.

Oh. This is awkward.

You thought I was gonna ask you
to go with me to the mineral show.

Weren't you?

Yeah.

That's very nice of you,
but I do have a boyfriend.

That's what you all say.

You just don't want
to go out with me

because I have
an off-putting personality.

No, that's not true.

My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

Way worse than you.

Don't worry. I'm used to it.

I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

Don't say that.

It's okay.
I know I'm a monster.

No, Bert, come on.

I'd love to go to the
mineral show with you.

Sweet. It's a date.

- No, it's not.
- BERT: Too late!

âª (ALTERNATIVE MUSIC PLAYS) âª

Wow.

Yeah. Haven't seen this
many people in my store

since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

- Hey! Stuart!
- Jesse.

Haven't seen you in forever.
Look how gray you've gotten.

My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

No, I was talking about your skin.

Look... my friend here
needs a comic book...

Ooh! And she went into
your store by mistake.

Good thing there was no
one there to see you.

What do you need?

Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.
Right over here.

Even you, Sweatpants?

Free popcorn.

Can I offer you a coffee?

- Espresso? Latte?
- No, thanks.

How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

Directions to the
nearest soup kitchen?

- Hey.
- I'm just kidding.

He knows where the soup kitchen is.

It's on Merton Avenue.

I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

Sorry.

- You want the book or not?
- Not from you.

Let's go, Stuart.

You know something, Jesse?

You may have a
successful business

and the kind of pink complexion
that comes with good nutrition...

but I have something
more important.

- What's that?
- Friendship.

Which I would trade in a
heartbeat for all of this.

The mineral and rock show?

That would be awful even
without Bert.

So what am I supposed to do now?

Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

This isn't funny.

I'm gonna have to
tell him the truth:

that even if I didn't
have a boyfriend,

I wouldn't be interested in him.

I've heard those
words so many times.

From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

- Megan Pincus...
- Tammy Cho...

Who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

- Arlene Russell!
- Yes! Arlene!

She wrote "no way"
on both our cappuccinos.

Poor Bert.

That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

Well, how would you want a girl
to tell you she wasn't interested?

I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me
down, look me in the eye and say,

"I was wrong. I love you."

And then maybe she could
touch me in a special way.

That's how you reject a guy.

Okay, I don't have time for this.

I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

- No, don't.
- He'll be so upset.

He'll probably climb
up the Empire State Building

and start swatting at planes.

You want us to talk to him?

Really? You would do that?

Sure. We've both been in his shoes.

We'll let him down with
compassion and respect.

- Thank you.
- Let's go.

So we tell him
she's a lesbian, right?

Of course we tell him
she's a lesbian.

And hold three...

two... one.

Very good.

Now let's try Warrior II.

And hold.

I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

Too bad.

It seems like a good way
to drink a milk shake

without getting brain freeze.

Oh, hey.

And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

How did she get you to do yoga?

Well, to be honest,
I thought she said "Yoda."

I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

Oh, How many times
do I have to say it?

- I support you.
- Sheldon, take a break.

Namaste.

Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

But if you care so
much what I think,

why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

Oh, so now I need
your permission?

Would you have asked me
before you quit your job?

Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

where we make decisions together.

If I'm wrong,
then maybe we need to talk

about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

Yeah, well, maybe we do.

I'm willing to if you guys are.

Can we please have some privacy?

No.

I'm as much a part of this
relationship as you two,

and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

Are you two ever getting married?

And, if so, where will we all live?
Have you thought about that?

- No.
- Penny?

OK, wait. What are we doing?

For some reason,
we're planning a future

where we both live
with Sheldon forever.

Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

Look, I know you think I'm being
reckless, and you might be right,

but I need to take this shot.

No kidding. Despite what it says
on her rÃ©sumÃ©, she is no longer 22.

I swear, I am on your side.

You keep saying you're on my
side, but you don't act like it.

He does that to me, too.
Why do we put up with it?

Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

- I would be terrified.
- Well, it's scary for me, too.

I'm fine with it.

My point is, just because I couldn't
do it doesn't mean you shouldn't.

And I'm proud of you.

Okay. Thank you.

Well, to celebrate
this reconciliation,

let's all share a milk shake.

Penny, you'll need a straw.

- You're back.
- Yes, I am!

There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

Stuart's store is just fine, and he's
a much nicer person than you are,

and if you still have that comic,
I'd like to buy it right now!

No problem.

Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

No, I don't want a latte!

I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

- I only have chocolate chip.
- Well, that sounds even better!

Thanks for coming to the
mineral and rock show with me.

We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.

Really, really sorry.

Nah, who needs her
when I have you guys?

CHANTING: Rock show!
Rock show! Rock show!

Rock show! Rock show!

- Really?
- Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.

Sunday's the worst!

they have left are small and XXXXL.

- Sunday's gone.
- Not Sunday! I love Sunday!

So that's it?
Everything's sold out?

Yeah.

I can't believe we're not going.

It's okay.

There-there's always WonderCon

That's just as good.

Guys, this is really sad.

And in a different way
than it was 20 minutes ago.

I can't believe we wasted all
that time on our Hulk costumes.

What? You were all going as the Hulk?

Not the same Hulk.

Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.

We would have been the angry green
belles of the masquerade ball.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

And we're back
to the first kind of sad.

Gentlemen, I have the solution
to our Comic-Con problem.

We don't need them.

I'm starting my own convention.

Sheldon, just buy
scalped tickets with us.

I told you. Buying scalped
tickets is against the rules.

If you get caught, you get
banned from Comic-Con for life.

Life, Leonard.

You're gonna feel pretty silly
when we're 80 years old,

and you have to drive me down there

and then wait in the car
for three days.

Do what you want.
We're getting scalped tickets.

I already found a guy online
who's willing to sell.

How do you know
this isn't a sting operation

set up by the Comic-Con police?

The same way I know that the people
in the TV set can't see me.

Sheldon, just come with us.

You're not gonna make
your own convention.

You know, there was a time
when Comic-Con didn't exist at all

until one lone dreamer
with a unique vision made it happen.

And you mark my words,
I'm gonna rip that guy off.

Yes, I'm starting
my own comic book convention,

and I thought that your client,
Robert Downey Jr.,

would be perfect to appear
on our first panel.

Well, now, why are you saying "no"?
You haven't even asked him yet.

You know, excuse me,
but I sat through Iron Man 2.

I believe he owes me
two hours of his time.

They hung up on me.

Did you tell them that you're
holding your convention at

a Marie Callender's, and that every
panelist gets a free slice of pie?

I didn't even get to that part.

Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton
thinks this is a waste of time.

Not true.
Wil thinks this is a great idea.

He was just concerned that
he wasn't a big enough celebrity

to headline such an amazing event.

Also, that's the same day
that he shampoos his beard.

Sheldon, I just don't think this
is going to come together for you.

You don't know that.

I still have plenty
of solid leads on this list.

- Good luck.
- No, wait.

I need you to call Stan Lee,
Leonard Nimoy

and Bill Nye the Science Guy.

'Cause, legally, I'm not allowed to.

Oh, and, also,
Carrie Fisher, you know,

'cause I hear she can be pretty nuts.

I can't believe Leonard
is spending hundreds of dollars

on scalped tickets.

Last week, you spent
that on a little dress.

Yeah, but those tickets
only get him into Comic-Con.

That dress gets me
into anywhere I want.

Those tickets were pretty expensive.

I had to give Howie an advance
on his allowance.

Now he's never gonna
put his toys away.

Why can't they do something sensible

like Sheldon and start their
own comic book convention?

Also, who wants
to throw me out that window?

While they're acting like teenagers,
we could do something grown-up.

Oh. You mean like a museum?

Yes, like a museum,
but anything else.

I know. There's a nice hotel
not far from here

where they do afternoon tea.

Afternoon tea,
how sophisticated of us.

All right, if we're gonna be fancy,

I should probably put on
clean underwear.

La-dee-da!
Look who has clean underwear.

No, we're gonna stop at Target
on the way.

Since Sheldon's
not going to Comic-Con,

maybe we could find a cool trio
to dress up as.

What if we go as The Fantastic Four,
and just tell people

that The Invisible Girl
is standing there with us.

Oh, and I thought our days
of pretending

to be with women
who don't exist were over.

(CHUCKLES)

Gentlemen, I am one step away

from securing a huge guest
for my convention.

Does that step include chloroform
and a roll of duct tape?

I don't think that will be necessary
for Mr. James Earl Jones.

You heard me.
The voice of Darth Vader,

the Lion King's dad,

and FYI, the guy who says,
"This is CNN."

Which also sounds like Darth Vader.

How are you gonna get
James Earl Jones?

Simple. Earlier today, he Tweeted
that he's looking forward

to going to his favorite
sushi restaurant for dinner.

I Googled an interview
from four years ago

which was conducted in
his favorite sushi restaurant.

That's where he'll be,
and that's where I'm going, and...

And that's where Darth Vader's gonna
pour soy sauce on your head.

Sheldon, I don't care if you get
scalped tickets with us or not,

but please don't be creepy
and go stalking this poor guy.

You're gonna get in trouble.

You're the ones
who are going to get in trouble.

You're buying
non-transferable tickets.

And from a stranger, no less.

Not only can you get
banned from Comic-Con,

if caught, you could be charged
with petty theft.

You think about that while
I'm warning James Earl Jones

about the danger of posting
his location on Twitter.

He got lucky this time.
There are some weirdoes out there.

(HUMMING STAR WARS THEME)

(HUMMING CONTINUES)

Forgot my keys.

Okay, great. Bye.

Our friendly neighborhood scalper
says he's running late.

Does he sound like a criminal?

What do you mean?

You know, did he say things like,
"Youse guys," or "Listen here, see?"

Yes. He's late because
he's on his way here from 1940.

I'm just saying.
We don't know who this guy is.

What if he wants to steal
our money or our kidneys,

or make a suit out of our skins?

Why would someone want to make
clothes out of your skin?

I don't know. Maybe 'cause
dark doesn't show the stains?

Now you're making me wonder
if we should have met him

at a neutral location.

Why do you think I told him
to come to your place?

There sure are a lot
of little kids here.

I can't believe we thought this
would makes us feel grown up.

I can't believe the waiter
thought I was your daughter.

Last time I got dressed up
and had tea was when I was five.

Just me, my teddy bear,
Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

- That's cute.
- It was.

Until my hamster ate all her babies.

It got less cute really fast.

- Should we leave?
- There's a bar in the lobby.

I could go for a drink.

Aw. Drinking in the afternoon,
just like her mommy.

Let me guess.

You like Star Wars.

You know, I've been in other movies.

But you don't care
about those, do you?

I have one thing to say
to people like you...

I like Star Wars, too!

Care to join me?

Thank you.

My friend Leonard said
if I bothered you

while you were eating,
you'd think I was a creepy stalker.

Well, your friend Leonard
sounds like a real weenie.

He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.

Okay, I'm on a Comic-Con
message board,

and there's a post from a guy

where he says he got caught
using someone else's badge,

and Sheldon was right,
he did get charged with petty theft.

Guys, if I go to jail
dressed as the Human Torch,

that might send the wrong message.

(SIGHS)

Maybe this isn't a good idea.

I can text the guy and tell him
we changed our minds.

Do it.

Okay. We're officially
not going to Comic-Con.

Hold on.
We always do this.

- Do what?
- Chicken out.

We're so afraid
of getting into trouble

that we never do anything wrong.

That's 'cause we're the good guys.

Even Batman breaks the rules.

You know I struggle with Batman.

I say, this one time,
instead of wimping out,

let's be badasses!

Okay, I'll be a badass.

But only if you pinky-swear
to be one, too.

Howard, you in on this?

No need.
I'm breaking rules all the time.

Name one.

Last night.

Drank my Pepto
straight out of the bottle.

What about that little
cup they give you?

Yeah.

(SOFTLY) What about it?

Are you impressed by that?

- A little.
- Yeah, me, too.

When I first read the script for
Empire Strikes Back

and Darth Vader told Luke
he was his father,

I thought for sure he was lying.

Me, too!
But he wasn't, was he?

He was not!

How messed up was that?

So messed up.

What do you say
let's go have some fun?

My wife's in New York,
and I got a Lion King

residual check
burning a hole in my pocket.

So, afternoon tea was a bust.

On the bright side,
every six-year-old there

was jealous of my tiara.

Not gonna lie, it felt good.

Let me ask you a question:

When did you guys
start feeling grown up?

'Cause I am not sure I do.

Honestly, I thought when
I got married I would,

but I still kind of feel
like I'm pretending.

It doesn't help that most of
my clothes come from Gap Kids.

Okay, so I'm an adult,

and the other day I saw
an old man slip and fall down,

and I laughed.

I mean, I laughed hard.

Like, out loud.

If he was conscious,
he would've heard me.

- Oh, my gosh.
- I know.

One of the tennis balls
came off his walker

and bounced right off his head.
I mean...

I almost wet myself.

I guess you had to be there.

I think I have you both beat.

Imagine trying to feel
like a grown-up

when you've never
even been with a man.

Sex is not what makes you a grown-up.

Yeah. Or you'd be
the oldest one here.

Really? Is that how you
talk to your mother?

He just parked.
He's on his way up.

Good. This is exciting.

It is. I feel alive.

What if we do get caught?
Who cares?

So we get banned from Comic-Con.

Maybe slapped with a fine.

I'll be an astronaut and a bad boy.

How will women keep their pants on?

Maybe it'll come up when
I apply for citizenship.

Oh, crap, what if it comes up
when I apply for citizenship?

I wonder if we'd have
to disclose something like this

when we apply for grants.

He's gonna be here any second,
what should we do?

You guys are such babies.

I'll handle this.

If he thinks we're not home,
he'll go away.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

(WHISPERING)
I thought you were a badass.

I lied about the Pepto,
I always use the little cup!

Is it true, as a child,
you were a stutterer

and were functionally
mute for eight years?

It is true.

Is it true they used scuba gear

to create the sound of
Darth Vader breathing?

- They sure did.
- Oh.

Is it true that you
were pre-med in college

and you almost became a doctor?

- That's right.
- Oh, James!

I could listen
to your stories all night.

(MAKING AIRPLANE NOISE)

I mean, really, what's
so great about being grown up?

Well, for starters, we'd be
splitting this check three ways.

I'm serious.
Who wants to do all that stuff?

Have insurance, pay mortgages,

leave one of those little notes
when you hit a parked car.

I told you it was Penny.

Oh, come on, it wasn't me.

Anyone could have knocked your
mirror off or whatever happened.

Maybe the guys are right.

We spent the whole night
trying to be mature,

and it was kind of boring.

I'm sure they're having
more fun than we are.

(BANGING AT DOOR)

God, I could really use exactly
two tablespoons of Pepto right now.

(BANGING CONTNUES)

(FAIRGROUND MUSIC PLAYS)

(SHOUTS) Hey, Los Angeles!

I'm on a Ferris wheel
with Darth Vader!

And he's nicer than you think!

(SHOUTS) I am!

(SINGING: "THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT")

Bring it home, Mufasa.

I don't understand
what we're doing.

Shh.

(SOFTLY) Whose house is that?

(SOFTLY) Carrie Fisher.

And she's a little crazy,
so get ready to run.

(SHOUTS) It's not funny anymore, James!

JAMES: Then why am I laughing!

(JAMES LAUGHS)

Sheldon, this is the perfect end
to a perfect night.

Okay.

But I think it could have ended
with the karaoke.

What were you trying to ask me
at the strip club?

Oh. How much does it cost
to get them off my lap?

No. Something about a convention.

Oh, right! Well...

...my friends and I couldn't
get into Comic-Con this year,

and I was trying to start
my own convention,

and I was going to ask
if you would be a panelist.

Why don't you and your friends
come to Comic-Con with me?

- Really?
- Of course.

And San Diego is
right across the border

from my favorite city on Earth,
Tijuana...

...where I'm taking you
every night!

Ay-ay-ay.

Ay-ay-ay, bang-bang.

So, Beau Bridges
is on my shoulders,

and Jeff Bridges is
on Marlon Brando's shoulders,

and remember, we do not have
permission to be in the pool.

Hey! Sheldon, wake up!

Angie Dickinson is about to
sic the dogs on us,

and I go under the water and
Marlon goes under the water,

and the water raises
about two feet

and sloshes all over her patio,

and the dogs freak out
and run like hell,

then we run like hell...

Oh, boy!

That was a lot of fun.

Who's Angie Dickinson?

(English - SDH)

Item 28: your pet name for me.

Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

I submitted you a notarized list.

I'm sorry, but "Gollum"
and "Flakey" are not acceptable.

Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob"

you don't like "Fester,"
you're just impossible to please.

We'll come back to that one.

This brings us to the final item

in our annual
State of the Relationship summit.

Item 29: Valentine's Day.

Ohh! The worst for last.

Classic Flakey.

Before you get upset,

I believe I've come up with
a way for us to celebrate

the occasion that we both can enjoy.

People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

but you go ahead, end with one.

I propose we spend a weekend

at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

I hate every word in that sentence.

Including "in" "at," "we" and "a."

Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

- to eat with strangers at your table.
- One step ahead of you.

Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

Very well. What are
the sleeping arrangements?

We've only been dating
for three years.

If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

I got you your own room.

What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

It doesn't. I know it makes you feel
like you're bathing inside a monster.

Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm still unclear

how this trip is supposed
to be enjoyable for me.

We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

on a fully functioning vintage train.

Vintage? Be specific.

An Alcoa FA-4
diesel locomotive

leading a train
of meticulously restored

1915 Pullman first-class coaches.

Wow.

I'm feeling the urge to hug you.

And one... and two...

All right, Gollum, we're good.

âª (THEME SONG) âª

Are you sure you guys don't
want to come with us to Napa?

You could probably still get a room.

No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea

to take Penny
to where wine comes from.

What? It's a joke.

Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem.

It's all for laughs.

That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

Howard, which pocket watch will you
be wearing for dinner on the train?

I'm sorry, what?

I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

it will be embarrassing.

I don't own a pocket watch.

Oh, my.

Well, then my apologies
for bringing up this sore spot.

Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

You have Valentine's plans?

Which came out sounding way
more surprised than I meant.

Let me try that again.
You have Val...

- See? I can't do it.
- I don't have plans,

which is why I booked time
on the big telescope that night.

Well, an evening looking at the
stars, that's still kind of romantic.

Except I'll be alone.

I'm trying to put lipstick
on a pig here. Work with me.

- We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
- Yeah.

Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

to see some action, so if you
guys happen to have sex,

it's cool if she stays in the room.

Same goes for the
two of you with Amy.

What do you think, Sheldon?

It's magnificent.

This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

I'm so glad you like it.

I'm prepared to say I love it,

as soon as I confirm there
are no hobos aboard.

OK.

Raj, I got it.

Bye.

That was your daddy.

He wanted me to say that he misses...
Why am I doing this?

Happy Valentine's Day!

Flowers and chocolates?

Somebody's trying
to get me out of my panties.

Don't be surprised if you
find five chocolates missing

and three gross coconut
ones with a bite taken out.

It came that way when I bought it.

Got you a little something, too.

Oh, jewelry!

Oh, my God. Lakers tickets?!

It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

- who will actually enjoy it.
- Ohh!

You are the best boyfriend ever.

Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

Should we take this little
party to the bedroom?

Don't have to. We have
the whole place to ourselves.

- That's true.
- In fact, if you want,

we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

- To the bedroom!
- Yeah!

And for the entrÃ©e, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

- Do you have any questions?
- I do.

Does this train car have
the original link-and-pin coupler

or the Miller Hook and platform?

I'm sorry, I meant
questions about the food.

Oh, of course.

Is the seafood risotto being
served on a train car

with the original
link-and-pin coupler

or the Miller Hook and platform?

I think we're gonna
need a minute.

Fun fact: it's neither.

They actually use
the AAR type "E" coupler.

If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

you'll hear the characteristic
click, whoosh,

...thunk of the knuckle.

Get out of town.

Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

Hey, Cinnamon,
guess who just did it human style.

Oh, my God!

It's a little late, but I'll take it.

No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.
That's really bad for dogs.

Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do?

We gotta get her to a vet right now.

I don't have a vet.
I have a podiatrist,

an optometrist, an allergist,
a dermatologist, a urologist.

You'd think I'd have a vet.

OK. There's one not far from here.

- Come on. Let's go.
- OK.

Koothrappali was right.
We should have let her watch.

Do another one, do another one!

OK. Here's my impression
of the Amtrak Acela

barreling down the Eastern Corridor.

(MAKES CHUGGING
AND WHOOSHING SOUNDS)

It's like there's a train
in your mouth.

Oh, yeah. I've got one.

The Amtrak Wolverine
coming into Chicago.

(MAKES PUFFING SOUNDS)

(IMITATES WHISTLE BLOWING)

I've been on that train.
And I just was again.

See if you guys can guess this one:

Bang! Splat! Thud.

How many trains
have you been on?

Tons. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

Wow. Your life's amazing.

Not always. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

- Why do I even try?
- I'm gonna fix this right now.

OK. Just make it
look like an accident.

Excuse me. You are at Valentine's
dinner with your girlfriend.

Now get back over there
and be with her.

You're right.
That was insensitive of me.

I have to go back to my table now.

- You should join us.
- All right.

Great. Now there's two of 'em.

- How much chocolate did she eat?
- A whole box.

Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

So the point is I may
have saved her life.

I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

No.

Maybe to her.

How big a box of chocolate was it?

Something like this. I don't know.

It came free with a full tank of gas.

Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

- Do you know how much gas is?
- Hey!

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you OK?!

I can't believe you two!

You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

and scrap them for parts!

- You're the owner?
- Owner, father, soul mate,

and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

Well, she's not throwing up,
which is a good sign.

So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

OK. OK, thank you.

If she's scared, you can sing to her.
She likes Katy Perry.

But don't do "Firework"
That gets her all riled up.

Got it.

Should have been a dentist.

OK, what was the best four-ten-four
US locomotive ever built?

Trick question.
There never was one.

- Or was there?
- What?!

In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

solving the problem of the Q-1,

creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

In what world is a
four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?

A world I don't want to live in!

Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

Hold on to your conductor's hat.
You crank the second and third axles,

creating a pair of
internal connecting rods,

and boom! Four-ten-four.
If you think about it,

the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

I may never stop thinking about it.

Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

Better than you think.

You know, if you ask nicely, they'll
let you visit the engine room.

I never want this day to end.

It's feeling like it never will.

Come on.

Hey, did I tell you what
happened to me at UPS?

As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

And with cheap chocolate, no less?

It wasn't cheap.
It was free.

We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

No, come on. It was a while.

It was a while.

- Is Cinnamon gonna be OK?
- She's responding well.

We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

All right. Would it be OK
for me to see her?

We're usually in bed by now,
and I want her to know that I'm here.

Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

It's OK. I sleep with my dog, too.

We're not supposed
to let people in back, but...

...I think I can make an exception.

- Thank you.
- Come on.

- By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
- Oh, yeah?

And I don't care what that obnoxious
parrot back there says. I crushed it.

I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

so what do you know?

- You OK?
- Why?

Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo with some weirdo?

Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

I'm going to the LEGO store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

See? It's not just Sheldon.
They're all idiots.

She's right.

So your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.

I mean, look at this guy.
You think he came like this?

When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

Now, he's been to space.

That's all me.

- I had a little to do with it.
- Oh, sure you did.

Who's Mama's big space man?

I am.

They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

- How long should we stay?
- I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.

- I saw a Thai place next door.
- OK.

- How's she doing?
- How is everything?

She's gonna be OK.
They're gonna let me take her home.

Good.

So I want you to keep
a close eye on her

for the next 24 hours.

Here are a few warning
signs to look out for.

If you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

Yes, thank you for all your help.

Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think
we were taking it seriously.

- We love animals.
- Do you guys own any pets?

- No.
- Good.

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

You guys missed
a pretty great time.

The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

- It was crazy.
- Dare I say "loco?"

Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

The conductor said as
soon as he gets off work,

he can come back to the bed and
breakfast and play his banjo for us.

OK. I need to speak to my boyfriend
in private, like, right now.

There's a car with a glass roof.
Want to go look at the stars?

- That sounds so romantic.
- Give it a rest!

Let's go.

- Why are you still here?
- Excuse me.

I think you're being a little rude.

I'm being rude? You've been
rude to me this entire evening.

How is that possible?

I've hardly spoken
to you since we got on the train.

I'm detecting a little
friction between you two,

and I don't want to be a third rail.

Get it?

I get it.

Leave!

- What is your problem?
- It's Valentine's Day.

We're supposed to be
having a romantic weekend.

Oh, really?
Because I remember you saying

that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

Did you mean that,
or were you just trying to trick me?

Fine, it's true.
I deserve romance,

and I didn't know how
else to make it happen.

Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

Oh, look, there's wine. Mm!

Grape juice that burns.

Now let's gaze
into each other's eyes.

- You blinked. I win.
- Sheldon...

Let's see. What's next?
Kissing's romantic.

That was nice.

Good.

Um...

The conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

OK, have fun.

Do you want to come with me?

Really? I do.

Hey, guys, wait up!

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

There you go. All cozy wozy.

Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

Hm. "Rajesh, I was
dreading Valentine's Day.

Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

Cinnamon, she gave me
her phone number.

If I'd known it was that easy,
I would have considered

poisoning you months ago.

Oh, what should I say?

Oh, I know.

I'll point out her name's Yvette,
and that she's a vet.

That's hysterical.

She'll love it.

- Hello.
- Hey. You're back.

- How was your trip?
- It was wonderful!

- Great. What did you do?
- I made a new friend

who likes trains
as much as I do,

I kissed Amy on the lips,

and the conductor played his
banjo for me.

Good night.

Wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna need more details.

Well, my new
friend's name was Eric.

Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

The banjo-playing
conductor was missing a finger,

but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

No, hang on. Hang on.
Are all those things equal to you?

Hmm...

It never occurred to me
to pick a favorite.

Well, give it a go.

I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

Additional data. You dog!

I'm not sure how listening
to other nine-fingered banjo players

makes me dog, but all right.

âª (THEME MUSIC) âª

(English - SDH)

I'm thinking about growing a goatee.

Actually that's a Van Dyke.
A goatee is just hair on the chin.

Oh. Wait, then what is it
if you just have hair up here?

You mean a mustache?

- Moo-stache!
- (SHOUTS) He said it!

Ha-ha, very funny.
Make fun of the foreign guy.

For your information,
there are four times as many Indians

as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

- Say what?
- Moo-stache.

- (SHOUTS) Moo-stache!
- He said "moo-stache".

Guys, you're being childish.

She's right. You're grown men,
the kind who are perfectly capable

of growing your own moo-staches.

(LAUGHS)

Hey, you were funny
on purpose, good job.

Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I was at an audition.

- I'm sorry.
- You'll get 'em next time.

How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

Sorry. How did it go?

Just shut up.

Here, you can have your seat.

No, no, stay there.
I'm fine on the floor.

Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

Sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

The pretty white girl's
there ten seconds,

and suddenly we're
all running to IKEA.

No one is running anywhere.

We're not getting
a dining room table.

I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea.

You guys never use
that space up there.

Why not get a table?

Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

How come we never get that option?

Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

a tiny change
in the initial conditions

can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

Translation?

(IMITATES BABY)
Wah! I don't want a table!

(THEME SONG)

Hey, Penny and I are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

You want to come with us?

I'd love to, but, I'm too busy

falling back in love
with Windows 98.

Seriously? You haven't used
this desk in years.

The second I want to get rid of it,
you're up here working?

I can't talk right now.

I have several thousand updates
to install.

Are you really
gonna sit here all day?

Think of me as Arthur Dent in

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

lying in front of the bulldozers
to protect his home.

If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet
blew up the Earth anyway.

It's a made-up story. I don't even
know why you're talking about it.

I'm putting all this stuff
in storage. We don't need any of it.

How can you say that?

You show me one thing
in here we can live without.

Hang on.

Check your in-box.

Wait. Is this really worth it?

We've lived together for years
with nary an argument.

Huh?

But we start talking about a table,

and suddenly we're
at each other's throats.

"Nary an argument"?

"Nary"?

That means "not one," or "not any".

Maybe instead of a table,
you should buy a dictionary.

I don't know if I won that,
but at least he's upset.

Check it out.

Magic wand TV remote!

Yeah, I can control
all sorts of stuff.

Did Bernadette think it was cool?

Not when I said "mute"
and pointed it at her face.

Let me try.

Channelis changeroni!

(TV STARTS TO PLAY)

This might be my second
favorite brown magic wand.

Well, that's the last time
I play with that.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

I have to take this.

HOWARD: Hello?

Off. (TV STOPS)

And on. (TV STARTS)

And the Oprah Network.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

This is so much better than
watching TV like a muggle.

Okay. Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

You're not gonna believe this.

What's going on?

Wait.

On!

And off!

What's going on?

That was NASA.

They want me to go
back up to the space station.

Wow. What did you tell them?

I told them I'd be honored.

A second trip to space.
I'll miss you.

And I'm gonna miss you, too.

I just want you to know,

I'm happy to look in on Bernadette
while you're gone.

Thank you.

And if anything were to happen
to you,

we will name our
firstborn son Howard.

I'm just kidding.

We'll name him Dalib,
after my grandfather.

This one looks nice.

No. Sheldon doesn't like
reclaimed wood.

Why not?

He's afraid the original owners
will come back.

Well, Sheldon's not here.

Well, he is here.

Unless you want to dig him out
with a bone saw and a melon baller,

there's nothing I can do about it.

All right, sweetie,
you're paying for this table,

and it's your apartment, too.

- I know, but...
- No buts.

You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

You're right. I mean,
he decides what TV shows we watch,

what food we eat,
who my favorite hobbit is.

I wanted Frodo,
but we can't both have Frodo,

so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

Wish you wouldn't,
but one problem at a time.

You make a lot of sense.

I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

Really? This one?

That one?

Damn right I like that one.

- Hey.
- Good news.

Someone in this room
gets to take a ride on a rocket.

Fine.
Can I at least shower first?

No, not that.

Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

What are you talking about?

Sit down.

NASA called.

The telescope mount
I installed on the space station

got damaged, and they want me
to go back up and fix it.

Wow.

Well, what did you say?

What do you think I...?
I said yes!

Why do you look surprised?

Well, it's just, after last time,

I didn't think you'd
ever want to go back.

Are you kidding? It was the greatest
experience of my life.

Really? 'Cause I kind of
remember a lot of complaining

and wishing for it to be over.

I think you have me confused

with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

Hey, all set.
What do you think?

There's plenty of room for everybody,
a view out the window.

My spot on the couch
has a great view of a window.

Sometimes I can see
space battles through it.

It's called a TV.

Give it a chance, Sheldon,
you might actually like it.

You're absolutely right.

Nope.

Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

So, when can we get rid of it?

We're not.

What about the roommate agreement?

It specifically states
that any changes in furnishing

have to be approved
by the Furnishing Committee.

Which only sits on alternate years.

Yeah, and by the way,
it sits over there.

Come on, that is ridiculous.

She's right. A committee that
important should meet more often.

That's not what I'm saying.

This is the thing
about me standing up to him

and not letting him run my life?

Yes.

That.

Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

It's not the table at all.

It's you.

Me?

It's always me,
take one for the team.

I have spent years
turning this lump of clay

into an acceptable conduit
for my will,

and then you came along
and reshaped him,

with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

"Fancy" sounds like a compliment.

Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

That's just what happens
in relationships.

Look how much Amy's changed you.

- That's not true.
- Please.

When I first met you,
you were incapable

of touching another human being.

Now you're holding hands,
you're going on dates,

you even made out with her
on a train.

She told you?

Of course she told me,
it's the most interesting thing

that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

You're too close to it,
but Amy has had a huge impact on you.

You're right.

Without realizing it,
I've allowed that woman

to alter my personality.

Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality,

you just had some shows you liked.

No.

No, I've changed.

Like the frog who's put
in a pot of water

that's heated so gradually

he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

Or you're the frog who's
been kissed by a princess

and turned into a prince.

Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.

Excuse me.

I have to break up
with my girlfriend.

- Sheldon, wait.
- No.

You've opened my eyes to the truth.

Amy has made me a more affectionate,
open-minded person.

And that stops now.

- We should call her.
- Yeah.

Amy, it's Penny. Hey.
Just a little heads-up.

Leonard bought a dining room table.

Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.

Amy? Amy?

Amy?

I'll get right to the point.

I think we need to end this
relationship, so...

Just sign this
with your finger, and...

please don't cry on my iPad.
I didn't get AppleCare.

I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

I'm a little surprised
you didn't get AppleCare.

Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do I sign?

At the bottom. I must say,

I'm relieved you're not making
more of a scene out of this.

I've already moved on.

Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

It doesn't?

Of course not.
This is just Leonard

trying to take the focus
off that dreadful table

by sowing discord
in our relationship.

He's manipulating you
like he always does.

Wait, now, hang on.

You think he manipulates me?

All the time.

And he knew that as your girlfriend,
I wasn't gonna stand by

and let him bring a table
into your apartment.

I mean, a table? Come on!

It is hideous.

Well, thankfully,
I won't have to see it,

'cause I won't be your
girlfriend anymore.

Amy Farrah Fowler.

Why, yes, I would like
to take a survey.

Wait.

You were really gonna stand by me
against the dining room table?

Of course I was.

Wait.

How do I know that you're
not manipulating me right now?

I think if I were manipulating you,
you'd be smart enough to see it.

How do I know you're not saying that
as part of the manipulation?

I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

Okay.

I'm sorry I gave you such a hard
time, I just had to be sure.

It's pretty exciting that NASA
wants to send Howard back up.

Yeah, exciting.

Can I ask you something?

Course.

He hated that entire experience.

Does it make me an awful wife

if I don't think he
should do it again?

Not at all.

He's forgotten how miserable he was
the entire time he was up there.

It's like me in those moments
when I miss India.

So you'll talk to him?

Why me?

I'm his wife,
I don't want to ruin it for him.

That's the dynamic. I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

Since when am I the buzzkill?

- Do you think this is cool?
- No, I think it's stupid.

Aha!

You're right, it's great.

- Hello.
- Hey.

You guys didn't break up.

No. Sorry to disappoint you,
but Amy pointed out

that you we only trying
to manipulate me.

Which you also
figured out by yourself.

Which I also figured out by myself.

Well, I'm glad you're still together.

Okay, you can stop trying
to make this about our relationship.

- Which is stronger than ever.
- Which is stronger than ever.

This is about you
trying to change my environment,

which was perfect the way it was.

But it got the way it was
through change.

The spot that you love to sit in,
that no one else can sit in,

only exists because, despite your
objections, I bought this couch.

Me. So explain why that change
was bad and this change was good.

Um...

You don't need to
explain yourself to him.

I don't need to explain
myself to you!

You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

Keep the table!
We don't use that space!

Damn it, I got cocky.

Hey, Bernie.
I'm home... Hello.

Hi, honey.

What's going on?

Maybe you should have a seat.

Okay.

I know my mom's not dead,
there'd be balloons.

First off, know that
we all love you and cherish you.

- Well, I wouldn't...
- Daddy.

You're great.

- Can I say something?
- Of course.

Hey, Fruit Loops.

Massimino?
Why are you here?

I heard you were thinking about going
back up to the space station,

and as someone
who's been there with you...

well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?

Sure.

The stuff you have is wrong.

You don't think
I did a good job up there?

You did a fine job.

It's just, you were scared
and miserable the whole time.

I think what we're all trying to say
is, you don't seem to be remembering

how traumatic the experience
was for you.

Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

Like a woman. Great analogy.

Fine, maybe I was a little scared.

You peed in your space suit.

You're supposed to do that.

Not during the fitting.

Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

before you went up last time?

Hang on.
That was just me joking around.

You wanted me to shoot you
in the foot.

Come on, how is that not a joke?

"You got to get me out of this.
Shoot me in the foot."

Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

And how you threw up
in zero gravity,

and it floated back in your mouth.

And you threw up again.
And so on and so on.

That was funny.

Okay, so I wasn't
exactly John Glenn up there,

but I've changed,
I'm a different man now.

I'm a little insulted that you guys
don't think I can handle it.

You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.

Really?

You've got to get me out of this!

What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

Check my blood pressure again!

I can get it higher,
just give me a second.

- MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hello?
- Hi, Ma. How are you?

(YELLS) How I am is not dead!

But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough

to pick up the phone!

(WHISPERS) Go, go, go!

For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!

That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!

Wow.

Howard, I'm so sorry your blood
pressure was off the charts.

Me, too. The doctor was willing
to fudge the results,

but it just seemed
so darned dishonest.

But the mission wouldn't be
for at least a year.

Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under...

My blood pressure's too high, okay?
Drop it.

You know, my aunt changed her diet,
and in a few months, she...

Went to space? I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

Not the green one, the red one.

Sheldon, Amy,
will you please come join us?

It's fun up here.

So why are you trying to ruin it?

No, thanks. We're fine.

I mean, if you people
want to eat at the table,

then that's what you should do.

I like eating down here

because this is how
we've always done things.

But if those days are gone,
they're gone.

It just makes me sad.

Now I feel bad.

Don't anthropomorphize him,
he's got big eyes,

but his feelings are not like ours.

No, it just seems silly
for us to sit in two groups.

It's not silly
if you think of that group

as being led by a big, evil baby.

Look at Amy down there.

Should we go?

Let's go.

Penny, this was your idea.

You said that I should
stand up to him.

Forget it, Leonard.

It's over.

Fine.

Rajesh?

Screw that! I sat
on the floor for seven years.

I'm staying right here!

Come on, Raj,
it's not the same without you.

Fine.

But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

Well, isn't this nice.

Sometimes the baby wins.

(ENGLISH - US TEMPLATE)

Raj, your tag's sticking out.

Thank you. That's the closest
I've come to sex in, like, two years.

Now I feel a little gross.

You're only making it seem
more real for me.

Hey, that's my wife.

If anyone's gonna make her feel
gross about sex, it's me.

Can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life?

How about Penny's
depressing acting career?

Hey. It's been a little tough,
but Penny's following her dreams,

and in my book,
that is not depressing.

Aw, thank you.

Is that book called
Lies I Tell to Get Sex?

Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.

Can I borrow it when you're done?

Well, I'll have you guys know

I turned down a part
in a movie last week.

Why would you do that?

Because it was crap.

It was a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie I was in.

Serial Ape-ist?

I thought you died in that.

She does. 42 minutes in.

While showering topless,
16 minutes after brief side butt

during a pillow fight
with her sorority sisters.

I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.

Okay, well, there are no
shower scenes in this one.

They just try to clone me
from my corpse,

but my DNA gets mixed
with the ape's DNA

and I end up running around
with giant gorilla hands and feet.

Am I missing something, or isn't that
the part she was born to play?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

So are you really not
gonna do this movie?

Well, I don't think it's the kind
of part that's good for my career.

But don't a lot of famous actors
get their start doing bad movies?

Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep
ever had to say,

"Must keep gorilla hands
from killing again!"

If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.

I don't know anything
about show business,

so if you think it's reasonable
to turn down paid work

and just burn through
your savings,

I'm sure you know what
you're doing.

I think we're gonna go.

Are you sure?

We were making fun of
failed careers.

We didn't get to tap
the juicy vein that is Howard's.

Hey, I work
at the same university you do.

Yes, and Hawkeye's in
the avengers,

but no one ever says,
"Help, Hawkeye!"

Can I ask you something?

Why do you constantly feel
the need to put down my husband?

I'm sure he does it out of love.

The same way my boyfriend
makes me feel terrible

about my life choices.

I think we're gonna go.

No, no. This is not a fight.

I was just excited that
someone offered you a part

and a little surprised
that you'd rather sit at home

and do nothing than take it.

Now it's a fight.

Well, with that sorted out,

I'm happy to answer your
question, Bernadette.

Howard started it.

I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.

I wasn't referring to this evening.

Ten years ago,
upon first seeing me,

your husband claimed
that I looked like C-3PO

and Pee-wee Herman.

And he called me
C-3P-wee Herman.

(LAUGHING) Still funny.

That was ten years ago.

Nine years, 11 months
and three weeks ago,

he followed that up by replacing
the slides for my lecture

with photographs
of nude fat women bending over.

Really?

The lecture was on
cosmic gas clouds.

That's funny!

I was there. It was funny.

In any event, that began
a decade-long progression

of insults, pranks and
unwanted magazine subscriptions.

To this day,
I still get a monthly copy

of Granny on Granny.

Which, other than its
surprisingly fun puzzle page,

is complete filth.

Thanks for walking me to my car.

Actually, it's for both of us.

Last night, I watched
West Side Story,

and I'm a little freaked out
by street gangs.

Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.

I don't appreciate your sarcasm,

but we've still got two blocks
to go, so I'll put up with it.

Whatever happened with
your online dating?

No one was writing me back,
so I stopped checking my profile.

Before I met Sheldon,
I was ready to give up, too.

Once, I even dropped
in on my OB/GYN

just to get some human contact.

It has been a while
since I got my prostate checked.

Then I met Sheldon
and look at where we are now.

What? You've kissed, like,
once in three years.

That's true.
Do whatever you want.

- Hey.
- Hello.

Listen, I was thinking you and I

could probably try
to be better friends.

Really?

I was thinking
what we have now is a bit much.

Seriously, I was talking
to Bernadette last night and

she made some great points.

You and I have known each other
a long time,

and I didn't hear the rest
'cause she took her bra off.

Very well.
(CLEARS THROAT)

How do you propose
we move forward?

For starters, we could stop
insulting each other.

That's a great idea.

And in the spirit
of our new arrangement,

I will mask my surprise
that you came up with it.

Anyway, I got invited
to do a little talk at NASA

in Houston this weekend.

They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.

You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom,

and I'll show you
around the space center.

I have one question.

Is this a prank
where we land in Houston

and you've made up
wanted posters

that have my face with
a mustache and a Spanish name

and then I get arrested
and deported to South America?

No.

I'm glad because I would not
have seen that coming.

Amy, I could use some help.

Let me guess. There's an undergrad
in a leather jacket

snapping his fingers
by the water fountain.

I thought about
what you said last night,

and I went back
on the dating website

and I was looking
at this girl's profile.

She's amazing.

Oh, she's cute.

And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

And judging by her lack
of Adam's apple,

she's been female her entire life.

I like that in a woman.

Great,
so what do you need me for?

Well, I was up all night trying
to write to her,

but I wanted to run it by
you first.

- All right.
- (CLEARS THROAT)

"Emily,

your face is like
a precious dew-kissed flower."

Wow.

I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?

No. You're supposed to be yourself,
not all desperate and creepy.

Okay, I'm getting
some mixed messages here.

Just say something normal like,
"I saw your profile.

"Looks like we have
a lot in common.

Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."

Yes. "Where I can be jealous of
the cup touching your ruby lips."

Or you just write it for me.

I'm not gonna pretend to be you.

I don't want you
to pretend to be me.

You can be my online wingman.

Like if we met her at a bar
and you talked me up.

Well, what would I say to her?

Just tell her what I'm really like.

And, if you think it'll help,

that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you

of the muscular tail of a jaguar.

Use your own words.

Thanks again for taking me
to the pharmacy.

It's no problem.
Is everything okay?

I'm fine. It's just some
stomach medication for my trip.

There's the remote
yet distinct possibility

that I may end up
in South America.

Remember the old days when I
would've said something dumb

like, "Why?"

(ENGINE THUMPING)

Uh, that doesn't sound good.

Remember the old days
when I used to point out

that your check engine light
was on?

- Yes.
- Get ready to go down memory lane.

- Penny, your check engine...
- Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!

Oh, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.

Maybe it's just something minor.

(ENGINE BANGS, HISSES)

Oh, good news,
the light just went out.

Are we playing individual
or teams?

Teams are fun.

In that case, I'd like to be
partnered with my good friend Howard.

But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.

The kind who finish each others...

I really don't think we do tha...

Do that! See?

- Oh, hi.
- How'd it go at the mechanic?

Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

Yeah, sure.

Maybe I can go with you
guys to Houston?

Isn't it late to get plane tick...

Plane tickets? Yeah.

- Will you please sto...
- Stop that? Okay.

I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.

I can't afford a new one,
I have no job,

and now I can't drive to auditions.

I'm so sorry.

I know it's a sensitive subject,

but can you reconsider
that part in the movie?

I did. I called them.
The part's gone.

They gave it to someone else.

Now that girl's gonna get
discovered and become famous

and go on Letterman and talk
about how she got her big break

on a cheap monkey movie

all because some dumb girl
thought it was beneath her.

At least they talked
about you on Letterman.

Come on, I can drive you
wherever you need to go.

How?
Unlike me, you have a job.

I'm just gonna have to go back
to being a waitress.

Like I will be
for the rest of my life.

Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.

I'm sorry, is the fact
that my life's falling apart

interfering with your board game?

It is.

You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey, you busy?

No. What's up?

Have you heard back from Emily?

I have.

Great! And?

And I'm afraid she doesn't think
you're right for her.

I give you one simple thing to do.

Contact a complete stranger and
make her fall in love with me,

and you blow it!

I told her what a good guy you are,

but she thought it was a bad sign

that you didn't write
to her yourself.

She thought it made you seem
too shy and passive.

I'm not too shy and passive.

You write her back
and tell her I said that.

You know,
when you have a second.

Look, I'll see if I can change
her mind tomorrow night.

What's happening tomorrow night?

I'm meeting her for coffee.

What?

We emailed back and forth a bit,
and we kind of hit it off.

I find a girl I like,
and you're stealing her?

No. We just ended up
having a lot in common.

We went to Harvard,
we like Chaucer,

we're both hardcore into quilting.

Your words fall like acid rain
on the wounded petals of my heart.

That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.

- What are you doing?
- (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

He's not coming out
until he sees proof

you don't have an air freshener
in your car.

This is gonna be a long weekend
for you.

You're the reason I'm doing it!

I said to stop insulting each other.

I didn't tell you to take him
on a romantic getaway.

How do I know what you said?

Damn you and your
noise-cancelling breasts.

- Hello.
- Hey, buddy.

You excited for Texas?

Oh, very much so.

It's not every day you get to
tour NASA with a real astronaut.

(GASPS)
Who's the real astronaut?

- Buzz Aldrin.
- Oh. Yay!

(BELL CHIMES)

Howard?
Howard?

Howard?

What now?

I have to go to the bathroom.

You just went to the bathroom.

I didn't use it because
it didn't seem safe.

Despite all my emails,
the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.

Well, it still doesn't.

I realize that,

but safety concerns went out
the window two apple juices ago.

Fine.

Why are you getting annoyed?

I'm trying to be a better friend,

but you constantly say
and do irritating things.

- Like when?
- When?

How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.

You just don't like admitting it,
because you're jealous.

Well, truth be told,

as a child,
I did dream of going to space.

Those astronauts were my heroes.

And when you got to go,
it was hard for me.

Thank you.

Because it made me realize
they'll just send anyone up there.

- Aren't you going to let me out?
- No.

But I still need to use the bathroom.

Here you go. Be creative.

What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?

No, turbulence is
just the equalization

of diurnal temperature
variations in the atmosphere.

I'm not scared at all.

Oh, apple juice,
stay where you are.

Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse

when I was plummeting
back to Earth,

apparently not being
a real astronaut.

(RUMBLING)

Okay, that was a big one.

I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!

I'm gonna need that bag back.

You sure you want to do this?

Yeah. Why wouldn't I want
to get my old job back?

It'll be fun to see everyone.

I haven't talked to them
since I said, "I quit.

See you at the Oscars, bitches."

Come on, let's just
get this over with.

"Let's get this over with."

Am I driving you
to the Cheesecake Factory,

or are we having sex?

I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

- I know. Thank you.
- Sorry.

It's just so humiliating.

So humiliating?

Am I driving you to
the Cheesecake Factory...?

I'm sorry.
I'll stop. I'll stop.

Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.

Maybe tonight will be great.

Sweetie, I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

and I love you for that,
but it's making me feel worse,

and I kind of hate you.

This isn't your car.

I know. I thought we'd take yours.

I don't understand.

It's nothing fancy,
but it'll get you to auditions,

and at least for now, you don't
have to go back to waitressing.

I don't know what to say.

Don't say anything.

Oh, my God.

I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.

Look, I admit that it's odd that
Rajesh didn't write to you himself,

but if you get to know him, you'll
see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

As a counterpoint, here he is,
uninvited and visibly sweaty.

- Hello, Emily.
- Hello.

Amy told me you were concerned
that I might be too passive and shy.

Let me ask you something.

Would a passive guy barge in here
to look you in the eye and say,

"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"

No, but a weird guy
with no boundaries might.

Okay, that's a separate issue.

Let's put a pin in that
and just focus on the passive thing.

I'm leaving.

Are we still going to go to
that Chaucer reading Friday?

You know, I think
I'm just gonna go by myself.

Not my best first date.

Yeah, but not my worst, either.

I'm sorry for every mean thing
I ever did or said to you!

I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!

If you weren't my friend,
there'd be a hole in my life!

Thank you, Sheldon.

Kind of like when
Firefly was cancelled.

But not as big.

(BELL CHIMES)

WOMAN: The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

You're now free
to move about the cabin.

- It's over.
- Yeah.

(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

Should we stop
holding hands now?

- In a minute.
- Okay, good.

(English US - SDH)

Should you really be
sitting in Sheldon's spot?

He's in Texas.
He'll never know.

I wouldn't be so sure about that.

Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt.

Well, it's true.

Once I saw him sit on a bunch
of loose change and add it up.

Have you heard from Howard?

I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

Sheldon didn't heckle him?

No, in fact, he was so well-behaved,

Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin
bobble head and astronaut ice cream.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Stewart.

- How's it going?
- Good.

Sheldon's out of town,
so we can do whatever we want.

We even ordered from
the Thai place he doesn't like.

How is it?

Disgusting. Do not tell him.

What do you guys want to do tonight?

I don't know.

I told Howie if I wasn't busy,
I'd spend the night at his mom's.

So for God's sake,
think of something.

(COUGHING)

Stuart? Are you okay?

No, I don't feel so...

- Oh, Stuart?
- Stuart?

Oh, my God,
you guys need to do something!

Calling 911.

- It's too late.
- What do you mean it's too late?

He's been murdered
by someone in this room.

âª (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

Welcome to another classic
Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.

I'm leaving.

You can't leave.

You're a suspect in the
mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.

âª (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

I didn't know his
last name was Bloom.

Yeah, it's Bloom.

Are you really gonna
lie on the floor

and pretend to be dead all night?

What do you think
I was gonna do at home?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

Are you gonna make us pretend
to be a bunch of lame characters

with silly accents?

"Lame characters with silly ac..."
What kind of actress are you?

You're right, I'm sorry.
It sounds like fun.

- Thank you.
- That kind of actress. This sucks!

Come on, guys.
Raj put a lot of effort into this.

And that's great.
It's not sad, it's great.

I think it might be fun
to be someone else tonight.

Actually, you're all just
gonna be yourselves.

Oh. Ecch!

All right, if I'm doing this, I'm
playing to win. So just to be clear,

If we're ourselves,
that means one of us killed Stuart?

Very good, Bernadette.
You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.

What is that, like,
the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

Or is Sherlock Holmes
the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

According to Wikipedia,
Sherlock Holmes came first.

Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi.

Now, here are some secret facts
about each of you,

including whether
you are the murderer.

Throughout the game, feel free

to ask each other questions
to uncover clues.

Got it.

Hey, who's the murderer?

Any question but that.

Sorry.

Hey, who's not the murderer?

Bernadette, can you not stand
so close to me?

What do you care? You're dead.

Suit yourself.
But I can kind of see up your skirt.

Thank you for my bobble head.

Thank you for not making fun
of me during my speech.

It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

We can't show up to
your mom's empty-handed.

We should bring something.

I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.

Oh, boy.

Despite what her Bible says,
recent archeological studies indicate

that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

they didn't exist in the Middle East
until hundreds of years later.

I was gonna say we pick up
a cake or a pie.

But an insult to her faith
is always thoughtful.

So, what happens next?

I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped

a fun and imaginative clue
somewhere in the apartment.

Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

and see if there are
any clues inside a beer.

Hey, I found something.

It looks like a little man
with a briefcase.

Oh, no. That's Clarence Darrow.

It's from a game Sheldon made up
called Chutes and Lawyers.

You slide down a chute
and then work your way back up

through the appellate system.

Well, unlike that,
my games are much more fun.

Can I ask you something? Why do you
like making us do this stuff?

Well, I guess it goes back to

when I was a fat kid in India,
and didn't have any friends.

I didn't know you were fat.

Yeah, I was 200 pounds
by the time I was in middle school.

Kids were mean.
Cows may be sacred there,

but it doesn't help
if you look like one.

Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

so I had to make up
my own stories and games,

and I promised myself
if I ever made any friends

that I would play
those games with them.

That is so sweet.

I've seen old pictures of you.

You were never a fat kid.

No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

A gazelle blessed with a flair
for storytelling.

âª (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

Hey, what about this?
It looks like a receipt.

- What's it for?
- For a cup of coffee.

But it's dated 20 years from now.

From the future?
How fun and imaginative.

So one of us came back from
the future to murder Stuart?

Correct.

Does the gazelle with a flair
for storytelling

know he's ripping off Terminator?

Does the smart-ass know
that Terminator was actually

ripped off from an Outer Limits
script called

Demon With a Glass Hand,
by Harlan Ellison?

Oh, does the gazelle know that
according to Harlan Ellison,

it was not ripped off
from Demon With a Glass Hand,

but was ripped off from another
Outer Limits script

he wrote called The Soldier?

I'm gonna need another clue.

Okay, give me the flowers and pie.

But if we show up
and you're holding them,

she'll think they're only from you.

They are only from me.

You said the gift of you was enough.

Yes, but now that I've seen
what the gift of me

with flowers and pie looks like,
there's no going back.

Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on her face...

We're leaving right now.

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

Sheldon, tell me what's going on!

I saw my mommy with a naked man

and she was trying
to be a mommy again.

You ready to talk about it?

I'm not nearly drunk enough.

Okay.

Do you have any idea
what it's like to see

your mother ravaging someone?

Does a brisket count?

I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

But didn't she know we were coming?

No. I wanted to surprise her.

What am I supposed to say to
her after something like this?

Well, did she see you
in the window?

- No.
- Then don't say anything.

I have to.

How can we ever hope to have
a healthy relationship

if I don't tell her
how disappointed I am,

and that I'll never forgive her?

Well, don't do it on the phone.

I'm just going
to tell her I'm coming

so she can give that
"Good Time Charlie" the heave-ho.

That's some tough talk.
I may need to cut you off.

Yeah, maybe you better.
I took a pretty big sip.

Look, she's a grown woman.

And... and your dad's been
gone a long time.

Maybe this is none of your business.

I beg to differ.

I used to live in those genitals.

And if someone wants
to move into my old room,

I should at least get a vote.

Okay, murder suspects,

Leonard has found the time
machine the killer must've used.

You're all inside it, and we hurtle
through the very fabric of time.

âª (SCI-FI LASER SOUNDS)

And welcome
to 20 years in the future.

Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.

Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

So far, the future's great.

Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

Fine, just try not to look too alive.

That's my jam.

So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

- But why?
- Perhaps this will help.

Here are some facts
about yourselves in the future

that might contain a clue.

Hey, I won
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

Not the worst idea.

Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

I'm a professor at Stanford.

So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

Oh, no. In this game,
as your careers both took off,

you drifted apart.
Kind of like how future me

lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

What does your card say, Bernadette?

Hang on. Do you think
we'd really drift apart

if we both became successful?

Of course not.

If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

you would just come with me.

But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

I might not have that much
choice in where I end up.

Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

we wouldn't need the money.

Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

Speak for yourself.

Last month, my company both invented
and cured Restless Eye Syndrome.

Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.

So, wait, if my career
took me somewhere else,

you might not go?

âª (VOCALIZES DRAMATIC MUSIC)

He started it.

Okay, guys, new back stories.

Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds

are super successful
and living in New York.

You're an actress, you're a professor
and you have three beautiful kids.

- Great.
- Really?

You think I'm putting
this body through three kids?

Okay, let's do this.

Good luck.

You...
Aren't you gonna come with me?

While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

I'd rather go back to that bar
in ass-less chaps.

Mother?
Mother?

Mother.

Shelly!
I'm so glad you're here!

I saw you having naked sex.

What are you talking about?

Earlier, I came here to surprise you.

I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.
Come in.

Um...

Maybe we should sit down
and talk about this.

Can you recommend a surface
you haven't had coitus on?

That's not funny.

Maybe we should sit at the table.

Well, I'm sure that you
have a lot of questions.

Who was he?

His name is Ron.
I met him at my prayer group.

How long have you been
involved with him?

A few months.

And of those few months,

how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

That is no way
to speak to your mother.

Perhaps not.

But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

to me my whole life,
and then desecrates

one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.

I will give you one opportunity,
young man, to apologize.

- Or what?
- Or I will send you to your room.

That's ridiculous.
I am a grown man.

I am a professional scientist.

And I currently occupy
the moral high ground.

Go to your room.

But I occupy the moral high ground.

Go to your room.

But I'm a professional scientist.

Go to your room!

I'm a grown man.

Can we please get back to the game?

In a minute.
I don't understand why any success

you have in acting is more important
than any I have in science.

Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

you might change the world.

If I become a famous actress...

I'm not gonna tell you why movie
stars are the best. They just are.

I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

Actually, our relationship agreement
covers a wide array of scenarios,

including career changes,
financial instability,

intelligent dog uprising.

FYI, we plan on selling out
the human race hard.

In 20 years, who knows
what'll happen with any of us?

I think you and Leonard
will be together.

- You do?
- Yeah.

I think you're
the best couple I know.

That's so sweet.

- What the hell?
- Excuse me?

Duh, duh, duh...
Let the dead man talk.

So, why do you think that?

Well, I feel like you guys
make each other better.

Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

And it seems like Leonard makes Penny
think more deeply about the world.

I don't know. Together, you two
kind of make one awesome person.

Aw, Stuart.

Now I feel bad for murdering you.

Oh, come on!

Penny did it! I win!
Suck it, jackasses!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey, can I come in?

Apparently any man
is welcome in this house.

Why not you?

I thought you were waiting
in the car.

That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

A Jew sits in front of a house
in Texas that long,

"For Sale" signs start to go up.

I take it things didn't
go smoothly with your mom.

No.

I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

You know, I sort of went
through something like this myself.

Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

a couple years after my dad left.

I didn't know she did.

Yeah, she was dating this guy,

and I was kind of a jerk
to her about it.

What did you do?

Let's just say
it was the most vicious

bar mitzvah speech in
the history of Temple Beth El.

Anyway, she broke up with him.

And she's basically
been alone ever since.

She never said it, but I always felt
I was the reason why.

I'm sorry.

Although, based on your story,

you absolutely were the reason why.

All I'm saying is
you might not want

to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

You may have a point.

I love my mother.

Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

And the healing begins.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Are you ready to discuss
this calmly, like adults?

I am.

Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

I know that this is hard for you.

I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy.

Doesn't this contradict

all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

You're right, it does,
and it's something

that I'm struggling
with these days.

Then why are you doing it?

Because I'm not perfect, Shelly.

And that man's booty is.

Well, this is confusing for me.

But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

So...

I'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

an outward appearance of acceptance.

That is very Christian of you.

Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life in this fashion,

then I should let you know
that the world has changed

since you were a young woman.

You know, it's not all sock hops,
soda jerks and segregation anymore.

How old do you think I am?

My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

You used to be protected by your
pre-Enlightenment mythology,

but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

named latex.

Are you having the sex talk with me?

Well, someone has to.

Oh, dear Lord!

No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

Come on, don't pout.
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.

Which is how sexy men pout.

It actually was kind of fun.

You're just saying that.

Yeah.

I liked the time travel element.

Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

It was. By Terminator.

Well, I hope 20 years from now,
we really are all still together

and still friends.

- Definitely.
- Of course.

Hey, how about this?

Whether we're friends, not friends,

scattered around the world,
no matter what,

let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 p.m.

and have dinner
like we always do.

Aw, I love it.

Putting it in my phone right now.

Yeah, me, too.

My phone doesn't have a calendar.

It's all right,
I'll just write it on my hand.

And it's done.

Yup, we're all in.

All right,
I'll see you guys in 20 years.

I knew it.

(English US - SDH)

Boy, do I have to urinate.

If only there were a solution
to that.

Seriously. I feel like I've got
a fish tank in my pelvis.

So go to the bathroom.

I can't.

Why not?

Because I'm trying to decide
between getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

Oh, "pee." Why'd I say that?

Forgive me for asking
a stupid question,

but why are you being stupid?

I'm not being stupid.

I'm employing the work
of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,

who found that people with full
bladders make better decisions.

Why did I pee before I decided
to move in here?

(DOOR OPENS)

- Hi!
- Hey. How'd the audition go?

I killed it. I was even able
to cry real tears right on the spot.

- That's great.
- I know.

Next time I get pulled over
for a speeding ticket,

here come the waterworks.

Here come the waterworks!

(DOOR CLOSES)

- Aren't you gonna ask?
- What is this, my first day?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

Can I get your opinion on something
that happened at work today?

- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

I did something that will either
make me look like a lovable goof

or a horrible monster damned
to spend eternity in hell.

I'm sure it's lovable.

I'm gonna go with monster.
What do you got?

Well, there's this lady
in our office who's retiring,

and they were passing around one of
those big cards for us to sign...

Okay.

No one told me she was in a horrible
car accident over the weekend

and what I was signing
was not a retirement card

but was actually a "get well" card.

(CHUCKLING)
I'm liking my odds here.

So on the card, in the hospital,

next to the woman who's clinging
to life are the words,

"Hey, Vivian. You deserve this.

And at least with you gone,

no one will steal my yogurt
out of the fridge."

No!

"LOL. Smiley face."

Oh, my gosh.

"P.S.
Good luck wherever you wind up."

Why didn't I put money on this?

(PHONE CHIMING)

Hey, that's my agent.
If I got the part,

it's still the second best thing
I've heard all day. Hello?

Am I a terrible person?

No. No, it was a mistake.

Am I a terrible person
that it crossed my mind

that she might die
and never see the card?

Now I think you're flirting
with the line.

- Good news?
- No, I didn't get it.

I'm so sorry.

You'll get offered something soon.

I kind of did. The part
in that awful horror movie

I passed on came back around.

Apparently, it's mine if I want it.

Are you gonna take it?

I don't know what to do.

Maybe you'll get hit
by a car and die.

LOL, right?

Hey. Emily, right?

Yeah.

I don't know if you remember me.

From the dating website.

Your friend emailed me
because you were afraid to,

then you tracked me down
and acted like a lunatic?

Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali.

Look, I just...
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

You were, like, the coolest person
I ever found online,

and I got really nervous
and I just blew it.

Don't worry about it.

And if it makes you feel any better,

you're not the weirdest guy
I've met off the Internet.

Well, give me a chance,
you don't even know me.

All right, here's your chance.

What? Really?

Thank you.

Fate has given me
a rare second chance,

and I swear to Vishnu
I'm not gonna blow it.

Or normal words
followed by a charming smile.

First there was PlayStation,
aka PS1,

then PS2, PS3 and now PS4.

And that makes sense.

You'd think after Xbox,
there'd be Xbox 2.

But no, next came Xbox 360. Hm?

And now, after 360, comes Xbox One.

Why "One"?

Maybe that's how many seconds
of thought they put into naming it.

Can you get the butter, please?

You know, however,
with the Xbox One,

I can control
my entire entertainment system

using voice commands.

Up until now,
I've had to use Leonard.

Then get the other one.
Pass the butter.

Hang on.

I don't feel like you're taking
this dilemma seriously.

Fine, Sheldon.

You have my undivided attention.

Okay, now, the PS4 is
more angular and sleek-looking.

- (MOCKING) No way.
- Yeah.

It's true. But the larger size
of the Xbox One

may keep it from overheating.

You wouldn't want
your gaming system to overheat.

Well, you absolutely would not.

And furthermore, the Xbox One
now comes with a Kinect included.

- Included?
- Yes!

Not sold separately.

Although, the PS4
uses cool new GDDR5 RAM,

while the Xbox One is still using
the conventional DDR3 memory.

Why would they still
be using DDR3?

Are they nuts?

See? That's what I thought.

But then they go and throw in
an ESRAM buffer.

- Whoa. Wait a second. Who's "they"?
- Xbox.

- You're kidding!
- No, I am not!

And this ESRAM buffer
should totally bridge

the 100-gigabit-per-second
bandwidth gap

between the two RAM types.

This is a nightmare.
How will you ever make a decision?

I don't know!
What should I do?

Please pass the butter!

Okay, it's not me, right?
This script is terrible.

Yeah.

I had higher hopes for a movie called

Serial Ape-ist 2:
Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

You know, it's still possible
for you to be good in a bad movie.

Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

"Sometimes I feel like I can control

the killer gorilla instinct
inside of me,

but then I see these bananas

and I just want to eat them
and then kill people."

What am I gonna do?

Well, for starters,
I wouldn't eat the bananas.

Come on! This is serious.

(STAMMERING)
Does it at least pay well?

Less than I was making
at The Cheesecake Factory.

What does your agent think?

She's thinking of taking a job
at The Cheesecake Factory.

You know what,
why don't you just do it?

You'll go have fun for a few weeks,
make some money,

and who knows what it might lead to?

Okay, look, here, page 58.

I oil-wrestle an orangutan
in a bikini.

Just to clarify, which one
of you is wearing the bikini?

Both of us.

So it's a family film.

Thank you again for dinner.

You're welcome.

- Good night.
- Uh, it's date night.

Aren't you forgetting something?

Oh, of course.

Did I mention
the PS4 controllers light up?

No.

Well, they do.

And then after coffee,
we went for a walk

and she told me she always
thought people from India

were exotic and mysterious.

So, with my mouth, I said,
"We're just like anybody else,"

but with my eyes, I said,

"Straight up, Red,
hop on my flying carpet."

So, you gonna see her again?

Yeah, we have plans this weekend.

And if it's a clear night,

I'm gonna lay
some romantic astronomy on her.

Okay, like what? Show me.

I can't do that to Leonard.

This is some powerful
panty-dropping stuff.

You have my blessing. Go for it.

Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

Penny, two of the brightest stars
in the night sky

are Altair and Vega.

And it is said
they were deeply in love

but forever separated by the
celestial river of the Milky Way.

- That's sad.
- It is.

But once a year,

on the seventh day
of the seventh month,

Vega cries so hard that all
the magpies in the world fly up

and create a bridge with their wings
so the two lovers can be together

for a single night of passion.

Wow.

Okay, that's enough.

Quick poll: PS4 or Xbox One?
Raj.

- Xbox One.
- Penny.

Huh?

- Leonard.
- PS4.

- Wolowitz.
- Both great.

- Bernadette.
- I like the Wii.

Thanks, Grandma.

- Oh, my goodness.
- What's up?

I just got an email
from my ex-girlfriend Lucy.

She misses me
and wants to get together.

Two women at the same time?
Nice job, playa!

Really?

Was it the "two women"
thing or the "playa"?

It was the "playa".

What am I supposed to do?

How am I supposed to choose
between Emily and Lucy?

Why do you have to choose?
Date both of them.

I can't date two women at once.

Zero women, that's my sweet spot.

Unless you're sleeping
with one of them,

seeing other people isn't a big deal.

But what if one of them asks me
what I was up to the night before

and I was with the other one?
Then, what, do I lie?

- Yes.
- Yes.

What do you mean, yes?

Were you seeing other women
when we started dating?

No. Were you seeing other men?

No.

Were you seeing other men?

No.

Aren't you gonna ask me?

Come on, really?

Thank you so much
for letting us pick your brain.

Yeah, happy to help.
So, what's going on?

Well, I'm having an impossible time
getting my career off the ground,

and I got offered a role
in this crappy horror movie,

and I just don't know
if I should take it.

Well, I have certainly taken some
jobs that I've been embarrassed by.

I wouldn't exactly call
Star Trek embarrassing.

I wasn't.

Me, either.

So, what do you think, is there a
professional downside to doing it?

Well, it's tricky.

You want to take projects
that you're excited about,

but sometimes you also
have to pay the bills.

When you're on the set
working on something

that you just know in your heart
is bad, not Star Trek...

Yeah, beam me up. I love it!

Anyway, those jobs
can be soul-crushing.

That's what I'm afraid of.

Well, I was in Stand By Me
when I was a kid,

and it was a huge success.

The terrible movies I did
came after that.

Imagine how that feels.

Sounds rough.

I'm telling you,
this business is brutal.

To this day,
I hate going on auditions.

Okay, I walk in, and I can just
feel them thinking,

"He was such a cute kid.
What happened to him?"

And then I don't get the job,
and I can never find out why.

Honestly, I get so depressed,
there are entire weeks

that I can't even get out of bed.

Okay, this was helpful.

Any news on your co-worker
who's in the hospital?

Poor thing,
she was in surgery for 18 hours.

She's alive, but she's
still in critical condition.

Oh, no.

The one bit of good news
is they put her

in a medically induced coma
before she read the card.

So, you know, silver linings.

Were you like this
when I married you?

Don't worry about it, buddy.

- Okay, bye.
- (PHONE BEEPS)

That was Wil,
he's feeling a lot better.

Apparently, he's 12-down
in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.

Did he help you make a decision
about the movie?

No. Did you figure out what you're
gonna do about the two girls?

As a matter of fact, I did.

I've spent so many years
living in fear,

saying no to new experiences,
but from now on,

I'm gonna say yes.
Yes to love,

yes to adventure, yes to life.
Whatever it may be,

the answer's going to be yes.

He's gonna die alone, right?

- Yeah.
- Yes.

I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

You know, I'm proud of me, too.

I've done all my research,
I conducted an informal poll,

and I've arrived
at the rock-solid certainty

I've made the right choice.

Well, that's got to be
a good feeling.

Oh, it is.

- Although...
- Oh, crap.

I had the same feeling when
I made my dad buy a Betamax

instead of a VHS.

You were just a little kid.

A little kid
who picked the wrong format

to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.

I also was certain that HD DVD
would win out over Blu-ray.

- How old were you then?
- Old enough to know better.

And now that I think about it,
I stood in front of a case of iPods

and I bought a Zune.

What's a Zune?

Yeah, exactly.

It's an MP3 player
brought to us by the makers of Xbox.

No, what are you doing?
No, pick that back up.

You know it's good.
You did the research.

But what if I'm wrong?

You know what?
How about I buy it for you?

How about I buy you both?

You know I only have
one slot available

on my entertainment center.

Then I'll buy you
a new entertainment center.

Yeah, okay, sure.
But which one?

How about this?
I've heard that if you flip a coin,

it will tell you how
you actually feel.

Because you'll either
be disappointed

or excited by the outcome.

Interesting.

So, heads it's PS4,
tails it's Xbox One.

All right, I'll try.

What is it?

A quarter.

Could have given it back to me.
That was a choice.

(SIGHS)

You look really pretty tonight.

Thanks. I love that jacket.

Thank you. Thanks.

I'm sorry. I can't do this.

My ex-girlfriend emailed me,
and I'm seeing her Saturday.

And I'm glad you like it,
it's from J. Crew.

I don't understand.

My friends told me it was okay to see
more than one person at a time,

but it feels like
I'm being deceitful.

Are you getting
back together with her?

No. I have no idea.
What would you do?

Usually on first dates,
I talk about music and stuff,

but I was promised weird,
so let's do this.

How serious were you two?

Well, to be honest,

we only went on four dates,
hugged twice, kissed once,

and there was a handshake
loaded with sexual innuendo.

Wait, a girl you never slept with
sent you an email

and you felt so guilty about it
that you had to tell me?

Yeah.

That's kind of adorable.

Are you sure?
Because this is the part of the night

where I've said something stupid
and the girl usually leaves.

I'm still here.

Yeah, but now you make me wonder
what's wrong with you.

We just met.

You don't need to tell me about
other people you're seeing.

Really?

Because "I'm dating two women"

is basically the only cool thing
I can say about myself.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

On the one hand, the Xbox One
has a better camera,

but the PS4 has
a removable hard drive.

Thoughts?

I can't feel my legs.

Oh...

I'm sorry, guys, but the store
closed five minutes ago.

But I haven't decided yet.

You'll have to come back tomorrow.
The registers are closed.

(SOBBING)

Let's get you some food.
You'll feel better after you eat.

Okay.

What do you want like, Thai food?
A burger?

(SCREAMING) I don't know!

SHELDON: Hey, look, a quarter!

How's that feel?

Great.
Not like regret at all.

Penny?

We're working together!

Awesome!

(English US - SDH)

I got to tell you, the more
I read about the primordial

gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.

I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now

is like being a rock star.

Only without the sex.

Yeah, literally, none of it.

What do you think about it, Sheldon?

Meh.

Are you kidding me?

This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

of our lifetime.

How can you, as a theoretical
physicist, not care about this?

Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.

What I'd like to know is:

How does this gravity wave
breakthrough

help the man on the street?
You know?

Who's looking out
for Joe Six-Pack

and all his quantum physics concerns?

Oh, my God, you're jealous.

Why would I be jealous?

I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe

just got proven,
the Higgs field just got proven

and you've been working on
string theory for the last 20 years

and you're no closer to proving
it than when you started.

Yeah, well, I've had a lot
on my plate.

We happen to live in
a golden age of television.

- Excuse me, fellas.
- (GROANS)

Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was

some big string theory news today
out of the Hadron Collider.

Really?
Did they find evidence to support

extra dimensions
or supersymmetry?

No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.

Why would you do that?

You're a string theorist as well.

Incorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.

I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,

I apply for grant money,

and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.

Later.

Do you think he's right?

Am I wasting my life on a theory
that can never be proven?

Maybe. But how great
is Game of Thrones?

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

Hey, you're up early.

I couldn't sleep.

I told you those Walking Dead
pillowcases were a bad idea.

No, that's not it.

Is something bothering you?

Yes, but you wouldn't understand.

Come on, try me.

All right.

I've devoted the prime
of my life to string theory

and its quest for the
compactification of extra dimensions.

I've got nothing to show for it,
and I feel like a fool.

OK. I get it.

I mean, not all the jibber-jabber
in the middle, but...

...I know what it's like to put your
heart and soul into something

and get nothing out of it.

You mean your acting career?

- No.
- Your relationship with Leonard?

No.

Your failed attempt
to go back to college?

No!

I'm saying you and string theory
sound like a relationship,

and I know what it's like
to be in one

and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.

I said Leonard, you said no.

I'm talking about other guys.

OK. Well, what do you do?

You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.

You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

I don't know if I can do that.

I know it's hard, honey,
but in the end, that's how you grow.

(BLOWING NOSE)

Penny, have you seen
my good inhaler?

Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

Hey, how's dating two women going?

Um, kind of hit a bump.

When I was honest and told Emily

she wasn't the only person
I was seeing, it went great.

So I tried the same thing with Lucy.

- And?
- She had mixed feelings.

But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.

Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...

...those feelings
became less mixed.

Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?

At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.

I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.

Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.

She is. But I like that attitude.

Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?

You're really going to do this?

I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out

that what I'm going through
is essentially a breakup.

And according
to Cosmopolitan magazine,

one of the most effective
techniques for moving on

is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.

- You're reading Cosmo?
- Yes.

As it turns out, there's an article

on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.

Anyway, it suggests
that I set these on fire,

but the smell of burning books

reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.

What's this?

That's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?

It was.

This seemed so elegant
at the time,

but now I realize I was just
a simple country boy,

seduced by a big city theory

with variables
in all the right places.

- It's going to be OK.
- I know.

As hard as this is,
I have to move on.

I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities

and get nothing in return.

I have needs, too.

So, you and Emily
still together?

I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.

OK, great.

But if we're really gonna do
a double date,

then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.

Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,

I don't say anything?

She's very real.

That's what it says on the box.

Right next to "dishwasher safe."

See? This is exactly
the kind of thing

I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.

I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.

You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

Or the truth about how close
I am with my dog.

You got it.

No jokes about
the year I took ballet.

You took ballet?

God, you never listen.

Are you sure you
want to do this?

The magazine articles suggest
that one of the ways

to get over a breakup
is a new look.

What about your old look,
well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

- "Oh, my God, I do look like that."
- Stop it!

So, how do you want me
to cut it?

How about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?

So, business in the front,
science in the back.

Or I don't cut it and
maybe just style it a little.

I'm in your hands.

Do a good job and I'll tell you
Cosmo's ten dynamite tips

to enjoy your PMS.

Can you keep him quiet?

Maybe jangle some keys
in front of him?

That doesn't work anymore.

He just thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.

So, now that you're
no longer invested in string theory,

what are you gonna pursue?

There are so
many exciting areas:

black holes, dark matter...

Leonard was telling me
about dark matter,

but I didn't really understand it.

Don't feel bad.
Neither does he.

OK...

...what do you think?

Have you ever even seen
a picture of Tesla?

It actually looks good, Sheldon.

- Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

I suppose I could see myself
in a scientific boy band.

Of course, I'd be the dreamy one
and the smart one.

Sorry I'm late.

- What did you do?
- I gave him a new look.

- It's cute, huh?
- Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem.

I don't need other girls
to see him walking around

like sex on a stick.

She's right. I'm too hot.

I'm excited to meet Emily.

Me, too. I just hope
he doesn't blow it.

Why would you say that?

Because he's Raj.
That's his thing.

Beckham can bend it,
Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it.

Look, I don't want it to happen,

but odds are he's gonna
find a way to...

Oh, crap, I know that girl.

- How?
- In a bad way, very bad.

Hey, guys.

Whatever you hear tonight,
just remember I love you.

Hey!

Emily, these are my good
friends, Howard and Bernadette.

- Guys, this is Emily.
- Nice to meet you.

- Hi.
- Hello.

Have we met before?

No.

I don't...
I don't... think so.

You sure? You look familiar.

Well, you sure don't.

You I know, you I know, you?

Total stranger.

Even if you had yummy candy,
I would not get in your van.

Did you go to that spin class
on Green Street?

That must be it.

Since when do you go to spin class?

Wow. Now who doesn't listen?

Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
What are you doing?

Looking through my textbooks
for a new field of inquiry.

Why do we have a geology book?

Leonard, did you throw
a children's party

while I was in Texas?

Wait. What's wrong with geology?

Let me put this in a way
you'll understand, Penny.

You remember
how you explained to me

that the Kardashians
aren't real celebrities?

Well, geology
is the Kardashians of science.

Have you considered
studying standard model physics?

You want me
to give up string theory

for something
that's less advanced?

You know, why don't you break up
with Penny

and start dating a brown bear.

Like you could get a brown bear.

Hey, I've got a good job.

I could buy salmon.
You don't know.

Maybe you could make
your new field of study

the calculation
of nuclear matrix elements.

Oh, please.

If I wanted to take up a fad,
I'd get a tramp stamp.

What about loop quantum gravity?

Oh, Duchess, look at me!

My quantum gravity's
positively loopy!

Who's the duchess?

One of the people
that lives in his head.

I hope he's this distraught
if he ever breaks up with me.

Well, if he does, I'll see
if my bear has a friend.

Sheldon, have you ever considered
not rushing into something new?

I mean, why don't you
take your time, enjoy your freedom?

Maybe something new
to study will find you.

That's actually not bad advice.

You know, I didn't seek out
string theory.

It just hit me
over the head one day.

How does that happen?

A bully chased me through
the school library

and hit me over the head with
the biggest book he could find.

OK, how about we toast
your newfound freedom?

Normally I refrain from alcohol,

but since my cerebral cortex is
twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

why not soak it in grape juice

that's been predigested
by a fungus?

And you wonder why other
children beat you with books.

Cheers!

Emily, what do you do?

I'm a dermatology resident
at Huntington Hospital.

And you know what that means.

Someone's skin's about
to be softer than ever.

This is making me crazy.
I know I know you from somewhere.

Howard was an astronaut.
Maybe that's where you saw him.

Wow, that's amazing.
What was that like?

It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

Up there
in the space station, you're...

Oh, my God, I remember.

Can I finish my astronaut story?

It was four years ago.

- Please don't say it.
- We were set up on a blind date.

- Please don't say it.
- You came to my apartment.

You're saying it.

Well, what happened?

- Yeah, what happened?
- OK, I'll say it.

(CLEARS THROAT)
I was on the way to pick her up.

My stomach felt a little funny.

When I got there, I asked
if I could use her bathroom.

Please don't say it.

One roll of toilet paper
and 20 minutes later,

I was so humiliated,

I snuck out the window
and never saw her again.

You know what else
I never saw again:

my security deposit.

I'm sorry.

I tried to unclog it,
but you didn't have a plunger,

and water was
spilling out everywhere.

Right, just water.

Look, I have felt terrible
about this for years,

and I'm glad I have the opportunity
to tell you just how sorry I am.

It's fine.

All my friends love this story.

They call you Clogzilla.

Get it? Because you
clogged up her bathroom

like a radioactive monster!

- Yeah, yeah, I get it.
- Howie.

Well, hey, it's not like
cotton candy comes out of you.

Come on, let's get you to bed.
You've had a lot to drink.

No more than Penny.

That's what I'm saying.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

Empty room.

If somebody says "Come in,"
I'm gonna freak out.

So, Emily, why did you decide
to specialize in dermatology?

I like cutting people with knives,

and all the other jobs where
you get to do that are illegal.

You're kidding, right?

(CHUCKLING)

She's scary,
but it's a cute scary.

Can I say just one more thing?

I had some kind
of food poisoning that day.

Sure, in retrospect,
gas station sushi...

maybe not the best choice.

Nor was climbing out
your window and running away.

But I think we can all understand
how humiliating that was,

and I'd really appreciate it
if we could move on.

Howie, we moved on
a long time ago.

- I'm just saying...
- We moved on.

OK. Fine.

- How's your soup?
- It's all right.

They could've filled
the bowl a little more.

(STIFLING LAUGHTER)

- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

- I need some fresh air.
- Been there.

Oh, no.

What have I done?

How you feeling?

Not so good.

Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

It's not my friend.

Nothing happened.

I don't know, I heard you reading
pretty loud last night.

Oh, dear Lord.

Where's Amy?

After she put you to bed,
she went home.

Oh.

I should call her and apologize.

- Oh, no.
- What?

Apparently, I called
Stephen Hawking last night.

FEMALE VOICE:
First new message.

SHELDON: Hawkman!

It's your old buddy
Sheldonoscopy!

How come you didn't
pick up the phone?

Oh, right. My bad.

You're awful quiet.
Everything OK?

Not really.

I had a bit
of an embarrassing evening.

Me, too. What happened?

I drank alcohol

and may have left an unfortunate
voice mail for Stephen Hawking.

I wouldn't worry about it.

He's got a pretty good
sense of humor.

I hope so.

What happened to you last night?

Well, turns out

I'd already met the girl
Raj is seeing

when I did a number
on her bathroom.

And that number was two.

Well, you know,
I've always been a fan

of a story told
by Attar of Nishapur,

about a king,
who assembled a group of wise men

to create a ring that would
make him happy when he was sad.

And that ring was inscribed
with the phrase,

"This, too, shall pass."

- Hey, Cooper!
- Oh, my God.

I heard you drunk-dialed
Stephen Hawking last night?

Classic!

Get out of here, Barry.

Whatever you say...

...Clogzilla.

Clogzilla. That's pretty funny.

I don't think that's gonna pass.

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

SHELDON: It's me again!

I gave up string theory.

You should give up black holes,

and we can totally
solve crimes together!

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

SHELDON: Do you know what's great?!

Geology.

Woo!

Look at this geode!

That's fun to say!

Gee... ode! Gee... ode!

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

SHELDON: Gee... ode!

Gee... ode!

I kiss girls now.

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

SHELDON: Hey, guess who I am!
Beep, bop, boop, bop!

I'm you! Get it?!

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

Are you mad at me?

Oh, no, you're mad at me.

I'm so sorry!

Beep, bop, boop, bop!

FEMALE VOICE: Next message.

SHELDON: Thiospinel sulfide.
Thiospinel sulfide.

That's even more fun
than gee... ode.

Hey, did you see The LEGO Movie?

COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
What a jackass.

(English US - SDH)

So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

Okay.

But I realize they're gluing fur
everywhere except my cleavage.

So, I asked the director why
and he says,

"It's important
to the story that my boobs

be the last things to turn ape."

It's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

Oh, and there's not
even a bathroom on set.

I had to go to the gas station
across the street.

I mean, I was dressed
like half an ape

and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

- Sure. What's up?
- Well, now that I've given up

string theory, I'm struggling
to find my next area of focus.

In your professional opinion,

which of these areas do you think
is the most promising?

Well, I think there's some
really innovative stuff

- going on in dark matter.
- That's helpful.

- Okay, of these four areas...
- Sheldon!

What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

- Thank you.
- Leonard, what did we say

about being a gullible weenie?

- It is just so frustrating.
- 'Cause you're trying too hard.

You need to do something else.
Get your mind off it.

Hey, how about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

Yeah. Sounds like me.

Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

All right. I officially reinstate
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

Great!
What do you want to do?

I don't know.
What do you want to do?

I'm starting to remember the problem
with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYING) âª

SHELDON: Hmm.

What could we do that's fun?

What could we do that's different?

What could we do that's free?

Got it! We order a pizza.

Are you kidding? That's what you
always do. Think harder.

You're right. You're right.
Got it!

We order calzones, cut them open,
eat them like pizza.

All right! All right!
I'll shake the brain bush one more time,

see what falls out.

Got it! There's a live-action
role-playing group

that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

and reenacts battles
from Lord of the Rings.

Okay, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

You know what?
Why don't we just ease into this.

Let's go for a walk
and see if we find a new restaurant.

Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

- No.
- All right.

Raj and Howard
are at Howard's moms,

but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

- No. Bernadette's working late.
- Amy's sick.

- What's wrong with her?
- Well, she talks a lot.

She always wants to hold hands.

That's not what I meant.

Well, if you were
referring to her illness,

your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

- What ails her?
- Oh. Who knows?

Come on, anything can happen.
We can push him down the stairs!

Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.

No problem. How's your mom feeling?

Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

I hide it in a piece of cheese.

Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

feed it to Cinnamon,
and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.

- What do you feel like doing?
- I was thinking we could watch a DVD.

Well, my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

Spoiler alert: 20 minutes in,
they find a prune pit.

Actually, how do you feel about
watching House of 1000 Corpses?

A straight-up gore-fest?
You hate this stuff.

I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow,

so I thought if
I saw it with you first,

then I could act cool
about it with her.

That's actually not a bad plan.

I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

but that first time I was like,
(HIGH-PITCHED) "Oh, my God, a prune pit!"

- So you'd watch it?
- Sure.

You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!
Help me get out of the tub!

Not that one.

So we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

- without researching it online?
- Yep.

Great.

This is how Anything Can
Happen Thursday turns

into It Won't Stop Coming Out Friday.

Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

Fusion and Asians?

I'm trying not to
think about science.

What the hell?

What... she's not working late!

- And Amy doesn't look sick.
- Why would they lie to us?

That's a good question.

Amy and Bernadette.

(KNOCKING) Amy and Bernadette.

Why did you lie to us?

Hey. Listen to this.

"Murder, cannibalism
and satanic rituals

are just a few of the thousand-plus
horrors that await."

I just helped my mom
out of the tub,

so I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

You're a good son.
I don't know how you do it.

Beach blankets, my friend.
It's all about beach blankets.

All right,
let's get this over with.

Ew!
It's got someone's hair on it!

Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

(BLOWS)

You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

And Amy, you told me you were sick,

but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

I'm sorry.
I just needed a break

from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

And we kind of just wanted one night
where we didn't have to hear

about how miserable you are
making this movie.

But none of that means
we don't love you.

I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

Have I?

I also love you.

You know what?
Maybe I need a break from all of you.

- Come on, Sheldon.
- Where are we going?

We're gonna have
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

You're gonna tell me all about your
science stuff and I'm gonna complain

about my movie,
and we're gonna support each other

- because that's what friends do.
- Okay.

If I had to pick now,
I'd probably go with dark matter...

Shut up.

(GROANS)

- What's wrong?
- I don't understand my food.

Chinese noodles
with Korean barbecue...

...in a taco.

It's fusion.

Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

- Not at all.
- Thank you.

But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say sounds like,

"Wah, wah, wah, clothes.
Wah, wah, wah."

Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

I am. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

for dinner on our next date night.

(FAST PACED MUSIC
BLARES FROM TELEVISION)

Okay.

So, in the last 20 minutes,

we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

We've seen a guy cut in half
and sewn to a fish.

And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.

On the bright side,
she didn't even notice the pill.

Why does Emily like this stuff?

Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

- What difference does it make?
- What do you mean?

Oh, come on, she could
have a freezer full

of ex-boyfriend's body parts
and you'd still go out with her.

I do like that the ex-boyfriend's
out of the picture.

I feel so bad
about lying to Sheldon.

How am I gonna make it up to him?

I'd tell you what I do with Howard,

but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

is gonna work with Sheldon.

He'd probably give you homework.

- Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
- Of course.

And you don't feel guilty about it?

Between Penny's gorilla movie
and Howard's gorilla mother,

I had no choice.

Thankfully, Penny and I have
a relationship based on honesty.

What?
I don't lie to her.

Oh, we know you don't lie to her.

Thank you.

Hey, maybe the answer to your
career question is in one of these.

Penny, there's only one cookie
with something in the middle

that solves life's problems,
and that's an Oreo.

Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

Come on, open it.
I bet it says something great.

This is Asian fusion.

For all you know,
there's a tiny Chihuahua in here.

Fine, I'll go.

"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

- Yeah, that's a good one.
- No, it's not.

- How is that not good?
- "Turn to you for wisdom?"

Clearly, that cookie is mocking you.

You'd never hear that kind of sass
from a Nutter Butter.

Since you're paying for dinner,
I'll let that slide. Open yours.

- Have you ever paid for a meal?
- Not with money. Read.

"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

Oh, try again.

(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON TV)

Let me get this straight.

So, he kills this girl's father,
cuts off the guy's face,

and is wearing it as a mask
while he makes out with her.

I'm just gonna say it.
That's not okay.

Why can't I be in a relationship with
a girl who likes The Sound of Music?

Raj, you are the girl
in the relationship

who likes The Sound of Music.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Hey, Penny.
What's up?

No, Bernie's working late.

Really?

Thanks for telling me.

What?

I'm having sex with
a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.

Oh, I think I see our next stop.

You can't be serious.

If I wanted to waste my time
on nonsense,

I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.

No, come on.
Tonight, we are trying new things.

Oh! That's a lot of incense.

Or someone set a hippie on fire.

Yeah, honey,
I'm still stuck at work.

Really?
Penny said that?

Okay, it's true.
I'm sorry.

I'll see you at home.

Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

You and I never just
hang out like this. Why is that?

- I know. It's weird, right?
- Yeah. We should do it more often.

Oh, no. I mean,
this is weird right now.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

- It's Penny.
- Is she still mad?

Doesn't seem like it. She got Sheldon
to go to a psychic with her.

A psychic? He considers them
not just mumbo jumbo,

but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.

Well, Penny can be very persuasive.

She's gotten me to do a lot
of things I wouldn't normally do.

- Because she has sex with you.
- Yeah, she does.

Can I confess something?

Once in a while,
I get a little jealous

of how close Penny
and Sheldon are.

- Really?
- I mean, not in a romantic way.

It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

and Penny grew up around horses,

so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

Well, it took him a long time
to get comfortable around me, too.

Really? What did you do?

Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

I gotta go.
Penny ratted me out.

FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

with money she took
out of your wallet.

I don't mean to be rude
or discourteous,

but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

to support clairvoyance of any kind.

Which means,
and again, no insult intended,

but you're a fraud...

...your profession is a swindle,

and your livelihood is dependent
on the gullibility of stupid people.

Again, no offense.

All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

Okay, I just did.
What was it?

Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a
physicist who's trying to figure out

what his next field
of study should be.

For your information, I was asking her
about the next Star Trek movie.

Okay, I can answer that one:
I'll be bored.

All right, why don't we begin?

(EXHALES)

Your spirit guides are telling me
that there's a woman in your life

- you're having problems with.
- That's an easy guess.

I'm clearly an annoying person
and have problems with both genders.

Yes, you clearly are.

But I'm seeing a specific woman

that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

Oh, oh, here we go.

- Does she have dark hair?
- Yes! Yes!

Your spirit guides are on fire!

The majority of people
have dark hair.

Even you, at one time.

Does she work
in a similar field to you?

Ha! The opposite.

She's a neurobiologist,
and I'm a theoretical physicist.

My spirit guides can go suck an egg.

They're telling me that you have
difficulty being close with her.

Oh, he does. He so does.
What should he do?

He should give himself
to this relationship.

Once he does, all his other pursuits
will come into focus.

Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean,
Amy is the key to your happiness.

Exactly.
Personally and professionally.

Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

You know what this is?

Yeah, and I reserve this word
for those rare instances

when it's truly deserved.

This is malarkey!

Wow, you really struck a nerve.

I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

Here we go.
House of a 1000 Corpses.

Now, just so you know,
I was a nanny for three years,

so if you get scared,
I can totally change your diaper.

Actually, I have to
tell you something.

These kind of movies
really aren't my thing,

so, last night, I watched it just
to see what I was getting myself into.

- Okay.
- And I have to be honest.

I thought it was disturbing
and weird,

and it made me wonder what it says
about someone who enjoys it.

I wonder that too.

Then why do you
watch these things?

Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

Sure.

They kind of turn me on.

And play.

(KNOCKING)

Hello. I didn't expect you
this evening.

Well, I was just feeling so bad
about lying to you the other night,

I... wanted to make it up to you.

And how do you propose to do that?

Unless you have Gravity
on Blu-ray under that skirt,

I don't know where
you're going with this.

(English -US - SDH)

Gentlemen, Star Wars Day
is rapidly approaching.

We should finalize our plans.

What? That's a real thing?

What is it, Star Wars Christmas?

No. Don't be ridiculous.

That's Wookie Life Day.

So when is it?

Well, it's not May the fifth,

and it's not May the third...

It's May the fourth.

Get it?

May the "fourth" be with you?

"May the force be with you."
Get it?

Oh, no, this face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come in.

Hey, you got a second?

Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

I'm working on
the Star Wars Day schedule.

Now, I have a window built in
after Phantom Menace,

for complaining, but...

...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

Sheldon, I've got some bad news.

What is it?

I just read online that
Arthur Jeffries passed away.

Professor Proton is dead?

Sorry, buddy.

What are you doing?

Comforting you?

Your heart might be
in the right place,

but your head, chest
and arms certainly aren't.

Anyway, the funeral's on Sunday.

But, that's Star Wars Day.

Yeah...

Of all the things about this
that are sad,

that might not be number one.

You OK?
I know he meant a lot to you.

I'm fine.

OK.

Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

This is something
interesting, boys and girls.

After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

Is... Isn't that a hoot?
(CHUCKLES)

We'll be right back
after I fire my writers.

- (OWL HOOTS)
- Oh, shut up.

Watching your old friend?

Yes. Look at him, Amy.

It's such a shame.

Struck down
in the prime of my life.

Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

- I'm not going to the funeral.
- Why not?

All those people
blowing their noses.

You can't tell the sick
from the sad.

I'll be at home celebrating
Star Wars Day, as planned.

Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

If we were in
a physical relationship,

you just lost sex tonight.

Hey, guys.

Hey, Penny.
Happy Star Wars Day.

OK.

Can I make you breakfast?

Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

No, thanks. Leonard and I
are just going to the funeral.

You sure? Not even coffee?

We have R2-Decaf.

Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

I get it... like C-3PO.

What happened to me?

- Hey, Sheldon, you want anything?
- No, thank you.

You're being so quiet.

Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

I'm fine.

Sweetie, are you sure you don't want
to come with us to the funeral?

I appreciate the offer,
but Arthur is gone

and there's nothing
I can do about it.

When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

No, he blew up the Death Star.

Why do I know this?!

Arthur Jeffries was a scientist.

I'm sure he didn't care about
silly superstitions like funerals.

You know, if he were here,

I think he'd say,
"Enjoy Star Wars Day."

He was 84.
He'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

Attack of the Scones
for the road.

Oh, like Attack of the Clones.

We are leaving right now!

Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

than he's ready to admit.

Really hoping this will cheer him up.

Me, too.

Although, it might've been
thoughtless of us

to bake a Death Star cake.

No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

chocolate chips and the ability
to destroy a planet

at the push of a button.

Well, anyway, it'll be
a nice surprise for the boys.

And Howie doesn't think
I take his interests seriously,

so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

OK, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

This is pretty cool.

You don't see too many
spherical cakes.

(SPLATS)

I wonder why that is.

I have a confession to make.

I've never been
to a funeral before.

Really?

I just never knew anyone that died.

I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

we had a barbecue.

Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

It's weird that he's... just gone.

I know.

I feel like I want to cry.

Oh, that's... that's fine.

Go ahead.

I can't do it with you staring at me.

Sorry.

No, I'm dry.

You're a big crybaby.
You start, I'll join in.

I am not a crybaby.

Toy Story 3?

The toys were holding hands
in a furnace!

Look, Arthur lived a full life.

And he inspired a lot of people.

Sure, he was
my childhood hero, but...

...the fact that I got
to work with him,

side by side, before he...

...died was...

(VOICE BREAKING) It was a gift.

It was a gift.

Thank you for being the emotional one
in this relationship.

- I got your back.
- Yeah.

OK, here we go.

Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

(GROANS)
Let's get this over with.

Since we all agree
Episode I isn't our favorite,

maybe we just skip it this time.

Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

should avoid espousing
the principle

that if something
is not our favorite,

we should just get rid of it.

You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

called the Machete Order,
where you watch Episodes IV and V,

then skip Episode I,

watch II and III as a flashback,

and then finish with VI.

OK, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

Get rid of the trade route part?
Then how would Palpatine

get Chancellor Valorum
kicked out of office?

How would he get
himself elected? How?

Can we get through one holiday

without you saying
something ridiculous?

It was just a suggestion.

Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

And you know
who got hurt by that?

Every single person
who eats breakfast!

I think he's taking this Professor
Proton thing pretty hard.

Should we try to console him?

Or... should we respect his privacy
in this moment of grief?

By staying here
and watching the movie.

That's what
good friends would do!

(ORCHESTRAL SCORE)

Well, at least
without Sheldon here,

we got to start with Episode IV.

True.

- I do feel guilty about him.
- Me, too.

- Maybe we should see how he's doing.
- Yeah.

- But after the cantina scene.
- Obviously.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Look at Arthur,
cracking up at a joke I told him.

I'll never hear
that laugh again.

MAN: You never heard it that time.

Arthur!

I thought you were dead.

I am.

Oh, it's fantastic.

I mean, this is the longest
that I've gone

without running into a men's room

in... in years.

Why are you here?

I don't know. I was...

I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

I know why.

You've come to me because...
you're my Obi-Wan.

I'm... I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

Is... Is that an...

...an Internet?

Wow. You're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from Star Wars.

After his physical demise,
he comes to Luke Skywalker

as his mentor in spirit form.

Well, that...
that clears that up.

You must be here
to give me advice.

Well, this... this is weird.

Most-most of my robes open in...

...in the back.

Those are your Jedi robes.

Wait. What...?

What... what is this?

Be careful with that!

Whoa! (CHUCKLES)

Neato.

I'm... I'm gonna need a Band-Aid.

So... what did you think
of your first funeral?

Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

You think about dying?

Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

What would you regret?

You know,
that I didn't travel more,

take more risks,
learn another language.

You know Klingon.

- That's true.
- No, I meant that as a regret.

I just thought of one more.

What's that?

I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

Well, it just wasn't the right time.

Yeah.

And this is also
not the right time.

Do not propose.

- What?
- I know that face.

That's your propose face.

I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

What's two to one?

I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

Oh, my... It's not a contest.

I don't know what
you're upset about.

- I'm the one who's losing.
- OK.

Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

so you could turn me down again?

Yeah, I think I would.

OK. Leonard,
will you marry me?

Hm...

No, don't you dare.

You reject me right
now and tie things up.

It's just such a big decision.

I don't want to have any regrets.

Did you ever watch Professor Proton
when you were a kid?

No. My dad controlled the TV,

so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

that Sheldon got interested
in science.

Not me. I got into science

'cause I was always
the smallest kid in school,

so I thought if I
became a scientist,

I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

That's cute.

Yeah, I thought it was working
for a while,

but then I found out
my brother was just

lowering the pencil marks
on the door frame.

How about you?

Oh, I guess it must have been
back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

Girl Sprouts?

My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

She didn't want me selling cookies
on some street corner "like a whore."

How did that get
you into science?

Oh, I went to the library
and took out a book on biology

to see what whores did.

On the one hand, if I say yes...

This isn't funny anymore.

Just say no
so we're done with this.

Will you marry me or not?

Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

No.

Really? Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

That's two proposals, one day.

Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

Hey.

Penny, don't get upset.

Here.

I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

Thank you.

Now, about that second proposal.
On the one hand...

Where... where... where are we?

This is the swampland
of Dagobah.

It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

So, um...

...what do you got for me?

Um...

Always...

...get... get a prenup.

That's it?

I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

Well, why do you think I'm here?

I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

Is this the... the first time
you've lost, you know,

someone close to you?

Oh, no. No.

I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

Yeah, I've... I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

My father died when I was 14.

I'm... I'm sorry about that.

And now you're gone, too.

It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

Well, you know, it's...
it's OK to...

...to be sad about them.

Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate...

...those who...
who are still there for you.

But I do appreciate them.

Well, then...

...what am I doing in a swamp...

...dressed like Friar Tuck?

Appreciate them, Sheldon.

(KNOCKING)

Hey, buddy.

Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

I'm OK.

How was the funeral?

It was nice, you know.

A lot of people showed up,

told some great stories about him.

Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci...?

Hey, the guys are about
to start Jedi.

- You want to go watch?
- I do.

After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

- Sheldon, that'll take us all night.
- That's true.

It's a good thing I had a nap.

Boy, some of the physical comedy
with Jar Jar

is a little tough to watch.

At least they toned him down
in the second one.

Yeah, he is pretty stupid.

Hey, we can say it. You can't.

- Hey, guys.
- Happy Star Wars Day!

(ALL EXCLAIMING, LAUGHING)

A Death Star cake!

Yeah, we were hoping
it might cheer you up.

And even though it meant
we had to miss the movies,

we could still be
part of the fun.

Well, you didn't miss anything.
We just started over.

Son of a bitch.

âª (ORCHESTRAL SCORE)

You're back.

Yeah, apparently...

...I'm here whenever...
whenever you need me.

That's nice.

Maybe for you.

Why do I need you now?

Well, as near as I could tell,

you fell asleep watching Star Wars,

and now you're dreaming
you're watching Star Wars.

So?

I mean, don't you see
a problem there?

I mean, how you're spending
your limited time on earth?

Not at all.

OK, good luck to you.

(English US - SDH)

Almost there.
You're doing great.

Thanks for lifting my spirits.
Next time, try lifting the box.

Please hurry.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I don't need a treadmill!

The doctor says you need
to get exercise!

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I get plenty of exercise!

(SHOUTING) Crushing my will
to live isn't exercise!

If she isn't gonna use it,
then why are we doing this?

She'll use it.
All I need is to rig it

with a fishing pole
and a HoneyBaked ham.

All right.

Now what?

- We set it up in Howie's old room.
- Do you know how to set it up?

Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
I think I can handle...

Ma, look out!

- (THUD)
- (YELLING)

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I told you this thing would kill me!

âª (THEME SONG PLAYING) âª

So she's gonna be laid up
for at least six weeks.

Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

Should we do something for her?

I know. Let's go see
the new Spider-Man movie.

Sheldon, we're talking about
your friend's mother. She got hurt.

I thought that subject had run
its course, so I changed it.

It's called reading the room, Amy.

- Hi.
- Hey, how were things on the set?

Pretty good, actually.

So the movie's
not as bad as you thought?

Oh, no, it is, but I decided,
instead of complaining about it,

I'm just gonna go in
every day and give it my all.

- Good for you.
- Thanks.

There's no reason
why I shouldn't be the best

bisexual go-go dancer
slowly transforming

into a killer gorilla
anyone's ever seen.

I don't know. The bisexual gorilla
go-go dancer in Schindler's List

is tough to beat.

Ah, very good.

Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

would be out of place in a film
about the Holocaust.

It only gets funnier
when you explain it, Sheldon.

I know.

(SIGHS)
Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.

Maybe we should get one of those
machines to help her up the stairs.

You mean a forklift?

- Howie...
- I'm sorry.

I just can't deal
with this right now.

Taking care of your own mother?
How can you say that?

Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet
for six to eight weeks.

Are you prepared to feed her,
wash her and take her to the toilet?

- I would do it for my mother.
- Yeah, of course you would.

You're a loving person.

I'm what my people would call a putz.

Look, I'm not crazy about the idea,
but what other choice do we have?

We get a nurse. Preferably someone
from a third world country

who's used to suffering
and unpleasant smells.

You'd hire a total stranger
to take care

of the woman who raised you?
That's so cruel.

Not if we pay them well

and let them listen
to the music of their homeland.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I need to tinkle!

Sounds like the job
for a loving person.

Would you liike me to play Polish music
while you carry her to the toilet?

You are a putz.

As advertised.

Thanks for coming with me.

Thanks for inviting me
after everyone else said no.

Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?

I brought my own.

No sense in risking
bridge-of-nose herpes.

Is that a real thing?

Well, until they invent
nose condoms, I'm not finding out.

Emily! Hey!

Oh, hey, Raj.

This is my friend, Sheldon.
Sheldon, this is Emily.

Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist.

I went for a walk yesterday
without sunscreen.

Do you see anything on my forehead

that I should be concerned about?

Um, you know what? I better go.
My movie's about to start.

- Are you here alone?
- No, not really.

- What do you mean, "not really"?
- Hey, should we get our seats?

Yeah. It was nice seeing you.
I'll call you later.

Yeah, okay.

That was awkward, right?

Is it because she's dating you
but was out with that other fellow?

- Yes.
- Good.

I thought she saw
something on my forehead.

And... action.

- Please don't shut me out.
- PENNY: Go away.

Just go away.

I swear, I will find
a way to turn you back.

What gave you the right to mix my DNA
with that of a killer gorilla?

I was trying to save your life.

Life? What life?
Look at me! I'm a monster!

And now I have blood on my hands,
or paws. I don't know.

You can't give up.
I love you.

I love you too.

But I'm afraid I love killing more.

Like, one day,
I might actually try and kill you!

(MANIC SCREAMING)

And... cut.
All right.

All right,
let's set up for the next scene.

Actually, know what?
Can we do one more?

I think I could do it better.

Let's just move on.
No one cares.

Well, I care.
I mean, look, if we're gonna do this,

why not try and make it
something we're actually proud of?

Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage,
but you should be happy about that,

'cause if it was a good movie,
you wouldn't be in it.

Whoa, whoa, hang on.
There's no need to insult her.

- And who are you?
- I'm her boyfriend.

- Isn't she too hot for you?
- A little, yeah.

Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

You can't do that.
He's with me.

You know what? You can get off
my set, too. You're fired.

What? You can't fire me.
I'm the star.

I'm the girl that goes bananas.
It says so on the poster.

Yeah, but we just shot the last scene
where we see your face.

So from now own, the star
of the movie is whoever wears this.

Hey, if you're gonna fire her,
then you have to fire me too.

Wow, that fell apart really fast.

Thanks for skipping the movie.

I couldn't sit in that theater
for two hours

wondering about Emily and that guy.

Oh, quite all right.

After my forehead melanoma scare,

I've learned not to sweat
the small stuff.

Well, sorry, I don't have all
the ingredients to make chai tea.

- You don't have to make me anything.
- No, I do.

You're upset about Emily
and you're Indian.

I need to make you chai tea.

Now, I have all the ingredients
except cardamom seeds.

Do you happen to have any on you?

Sorry, I left them in my turban.

Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea.

They destroyed your culture.
That's close enough.

You know, I'm curious,

why are you so upset
about seeing Emily with another man?

Wouldn't you be upset if you saw
Amy out with someone else?

Can't happen. We have an ironclad
relationship agreement

which precludes her from physical
contact with anyone other than me.

But you don't have sex
with her either.

(SCOFFS)
Slick, huh?

To be truthful,
Emily and I haven't dated that long,

and we never agreed
to be exclusive to each other.

Have you had intercourse?

No.

Well, stick to your guns.
There will be a lot of pressure.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm hungry again!

It's like the world's
fattest cuckoo clock.

You know, you're always talking
about having a baby someday.

- This is exactly what it'll be like.
- No, it's not.

Come on. The constant fussing,
eating, pooping, burping, drooling.

We're even waiting for the day
when she can finally walk on her own.

Maybe you're right.

Anything she finds on the floor
goes right in her mouth.

I'm just telling you now,
if we do have kids,

don't expect me to do all the work.

Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

I'd be excellent
at taking care of a baby.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm still hungry!

(SHOUTING) I'm coming, you big baby!

You know, the only thing
worse than doing a movie

where they glue monkey hair
to your ass

is getting fired from a movie where
they glue monkey hair to your ass.

Forget it, man, it's crap.
You just move on to the next thing.

Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.
You used to be famous.

Hey. I just lost a job for you.

You're right,
I'm sorry, you're famous.

Penny, it's not about being famous.
It's about the art.

It's about the passion
we have for our craft.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

I have an audition
for Sharknado 2!

If I book this, I am totally gonna
pay you back for this beer.

God, what am I doing with my life?

You having second
thoughts about acting?

You were on set,
you saw what it was like.

Yeah, but it's not always that bad.

Oh, really?

What about when you did Anne Frank
at that cute little theater?

It was over a bowling alley.

Yeah, but...

...there was ample parking.

Are you done?

And you were so good
in the TV commercial.

It was for hemorrhoid cream.

And I got itchy and swollen
just watching you.

Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.

Come on. How can you be sad
when you're going home

with all five-foot-six of this?

You think you're five-foot-six,
that's funny.

I don't understand it.

I'm a nice guy, I have a great job,

I'm well-educated,
come from a good family...

Why don't women want to be with me?

An interesting question.

Well... good night.

What? Don't send me home.
I can't be alone right now.

That's your problem.
You can't be alone.

What do you mean?

How many women
have you had dates with?

Eleven.

How many of those women did you think
would become your perfect companion?

Eleven.

Wait. Do I count the 200-pound
Sailor Moon girl

that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic-Con?

Sure.

I'll stick with 11.
She liked Howard better.

Well, now do you see the problem?

Maybe. I...
I don't know.

It's late, I... I should...
I should go.

Look, I do get what you're saying.

Instead of desperately clinging
to any woman who will go out with me,

I need to work
on my fear of being alone.

I was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...

...it's my bedtime, so whatever
gets you out the door. Good night.

Howie, I'm back!

(SHUSHING)

I just got her to sleep.

Sorry.

What took you so long?
The grocery store's a few blocks away.

They only had regular yogurt.
I had to go to a different store

to get the extra-fat kind
your mom likes.

Then why do I smell coffee
on your breath?

So what? After two days
of taking care of her,

excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.

(HIGH-PITCHED) A mocha?
Well, it must be nice to be queen.

Queen?
I've been killing myself here!

Well, whose fault is that? I wanted
to get a nurse, but you were all,

(IMITATING BERNADETTE)
"I'm nice. I want to take care of people."

I'm glad I got that mocha.
And you know what else I'm glad about?

(SHOUTING) I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!

Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go rub her belly again.

(KNOCKING)

- Hey.
- Thanks for letting me come over.

Of course.
Please, come in.

I just wanted to say how sorry
I am about tonight, and...

...I want to make sure that we're okay.

Look, you and I haven't made
any commitments to each other.

I know.
I just felt like I needed to explain.

The guy I was
with did my last tattoo,

and he's been
asking me out for months.

I finally said yes
just to get it over with.

- It's okay.
- Really?

Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,

but that's my issue, not yours.

Wow.

If I saw you out with another woman,
I'd be pretty upset.

Thank you.

Not just for being upset,
but for believing that could happen.

Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

Well, me neither.

- Okay.
- Okay.

Please.

- So, you... You have tattoos?
- Yeah.

I don't.

I have a hole in my belly button that
may or may not have been a piercing.

- That's cool.
- It's a piercing.

So... how many tattoos?

One on my shoulder,
one not on my shoulder

and one really not on my shoulder.

It's, uh... been a long time
since I've seen a girl's...

...really not her shoulder.

Well...

...how about you show me
your piercing

and I show you my tattoos?

But before I take my shirt off,
I just need, like,

ten minutes to do some crunches.

Oh, my God.

What a day.

Can I get you anything?

No.

I need to start
making some smart decisions.

With your career?

With my life.

Like what?

I don't know.

We could get married.

- Come on, be serious.
- I am.

Why?
Because I'm a "smart decision"?

Well, yeah.

So, I'm like a bran muffin.

What, no, that's not what I'm saying.

No, it's exactly what you're saying.
I'm the boring thing

you're choosing
because I'm good for you.

What does it matter?
The point is, I'm choosing you.

Well, it matters a lot.
I don't want to be a bran muffin.

I want to be a...
Cinnabon, you know?

A strawberry Pop-Tart.

Something you're excited about even
though it could give you diabetes.

Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.

No, no. No, it's too late.
I'm your bran muffin.

Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.

You know what? Forget it.
I never should've brought it up.

You know I want to marry you,
but you're only doing this

because you got fired
and you're feeling sorry for yourself.

Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired

from that movie was the best thing
that could have happened to me, okay.

I finally realize
I don't need to be famous

or have some big career to be happy.

- Then what do you need?
- You, you stupid Pop-Tart!

Oh.

Then I guess I'm in.

Really?
You guess you're in?

Not like, "I guess I'm in."
Like "I guess I'm in!"

Okay. Cool.

So is that it?
Are we engaged?

Yeah, I think so.

All right.

What's wrong?

I'm not sure.
Just... feels a little anticlimactic.

Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

Oh, I know.

This might help.

Where did you get a ring?

I've... had it for a couple years,
not important.

Penny... will you marry me?

Oh, my God, yes.

This would have been
so much more romantic

if you didn't have
monkey hair on your finger.

How you feeling?

Last night was a little rough,
but I think we're gonna get through this.

I'm proud of us.

Me, too.

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Where's mypancakes?

Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!

- You were right.
- Welcome to Team Putz.

(English US - SDH)

How's your mom holding up?

She's doing okay,
but we just lost another nurse.

How many is that now?

Two, and I know what you're
thinking: she's eating them.

She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

So, who's watching her now?

A bowl full of M&M's
with a few Ambien tossed in.

What up, guys?

- Hello.
- Hey.

Okay, well, now that everyone's here,

Penny and I have some big news.

We're engaged!

Oh, my God! Congratulations!

And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

(ALL CHEERING)

- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Hey!

What the hell!

You guys propose all the time.
This never happens.

You're right!

âª (THEME SONG PLAYS)

Boy, I'm so hungry today.

I wonder why?

Because you had sex the other night?

You know what?

That may be it.

By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

Like, I fell off a few times.

- Hey, buddy.
- Hello.

You okay?

I just got called
into President Siebert's office.

The university
won't let me switch my field

of study to inflationary
cosmology.

They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

- Why?
- He said it's why they hired me,

it's what my grant
was designated for,

and that everybody has to
do things they don't want to do.

He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

even though he didn't want to,
which was look at my stupid face.

That's a rude thing to say out loud.

It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm
tempted to leave the university.

You know, if you're
really serious about that,

I hear there are some
exciting opportunities

in home care for the old and fat.

Whatever you do,
just don't make any rash decisions.

I don't know. I am really aggravated.

When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

But that's just me.

- Oh, come on, give her a chance.
- No.

No, life, it is too short.

I know you've only been here
a day and a half,

but you're like part of the family!

I don't think the service
is gonna send any more people.

Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

That's not helpful.

Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

that we're gonna be living here
the next few months.

But we have jobs.
We can't babysit her 24 hours a day.

Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

I wanted to go to Hawaii, not Hell.

I don't know what else we can do.

Howie, I love you, and as your wife,
your mother is every bit

as much my problem
as she is yours, so...

...I want a divorce.

Hello, Leonard.

Hi, Mom.

I have some exciting news.

I'm listening.

Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

and be happy for me and keep
any concerns you have to yourself?

No.

Let me save you all
of your hemming and hawing.

Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

Would you like for you
and me to talk more?

You know what? It's probably fine.

In any event,
while I've had my misgivings

about... Penny...

...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,

and if she is good enough for him,

then she's good enough for me.

I'm your son. What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

Sure.

Thanks, Mom.

Leonard, would it make
you feel better

to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

Yes, it would.

Yeah, well, you should work on that.

No, Mom, it's the same guy I've gone
out with for the past two years.

Yeah, the scientist.

Well, it's complicated. I mean, he
works with lasers and atomic magnets.

No, I did not see it coming.

No, we did not set a date.
No, I'm not pregnant.

Yeah, this is a first for our family.

All right, tell Dad I love him.
I gotta go. All right, bye.

- Atomic magnets?
- Shut up.

Sorry I'm late.
The leaf blower broke,

so I had to hand-dry
my mother-in-law.

(DOOR CLOSES)

- You want some wine?
- Thanks.

Little warning before you jump
into this marriage business:

you're not just marrying him,
you're marrying his family.

I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.

It doesn't matter if she's okay
with you. The question is:

can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

Hit me again.

So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

at some point, I'll move in
with him, or he'll move in with me.

Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

You're not working! How would you
like a job in home health care?

Not a chance.

- Please. I'm desperate.
- No.

- I'll pay you anything you want.
- Okay, then, yeah.

No! Keep your money!

I could've ridden
a bull longer than that.

What you working on?

I'm writing an appeal
to the Faculty Senate,

so that I can move
on from string theory.

How's it going?

You tell me.

(CLEARS THROAT)

"Dear esteemed colleagues,

As you may know, I have requested
to change my field of study.

My decision to do so is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

At your convenience,
I'd be happy to explain it to you

in words you'll understand."

It's nice that
you called them esteemed.

You're right. I'll take that out.

So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

Now that Penny and I are engaged,

I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

Of course.

She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

about preserving the myth
of her virginity before the wedding.

- I'm not.
- Good,

because not only
has that ship sailed,

if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

Actually, this is about
where she and I are going to live.

What do you mean?

Well, well, we might
want to live together.

Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

and I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

one day a week for a trial period.

Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

That's very sweet.

But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

...not you.

I don't understand.

How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

Look, I know this is...
this is change,

- and that sounds scary...
- Where are you going to go?

I don't know.

We just started to think about this.

Maybe I'll move in with Penny,

or maybe she and I'll take this
place, you can move across the hall.

Move across the hall?

Did you take a marijuana?

No, I did not.

Did you get hit on the head
with a coconut?

- No.
- Well, then, I'm all out of guesses.

What? Me move across the hall... Why
would you even suggest such a thing?

Because I love Penny, and want
to give her the life she deserves.

I see.

You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

Well, yeah.

Wow.

How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

They just don't appreciate you.

Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

he may not want
to live with me anymore.

Here, I made you
some Strawberry Quik.

I have real problems here, Amy.

I can't be mollified with
a beverage designed for children.

Mm. Yummy.

You know,
this might work out for the best.

You're always complaining about
what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

Like how he turns up
the thermostat when you're not there.

Ugh. It's like
walking into the Amazon.

And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

The awful one with birds and snakes.

You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

Four keys!

Who does he think he is, a warden?

See? Maybe you'll love living alone.

I don't know. Perhaps.

And if it turns out you don't...
you and I could live together.

You and...
Oh, sure.

And while we're at it,
why don't we get engaged, too?

Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

Enjoy our sunset years together?
Do you hear yourself, woman?

- Sheldon, it was just a thought.
- No. Here's a thought.

You're not moving in,
Leonard's not moving out,

everything stays
exactly the way it is.

And by the way, I saw you make
this Strawberry Quik with syrup,

and you're supposed
to use the powder!

- It tastes the same.
- No. The syrup tastes better,

and I don't like it.

This is so sweet!
You never cook for me.

Well, you cook for me
all the time and...

(GROANS)

If you don't like my cooking,
why haven't you ever said anything?

It's hard to talk
with so much heavy chewing to do.

- Sorry. I'll get better.
- I know you'll try.

So, should we talk
about setting a date?

Well, I'd like to pick one that works
with my brother's schedule.

Okay, and when would that be?

Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

(KNOCKING)

- Hi, is Sheldon here?
- No, I thought he was with you.

He was, but he stormed off.

- Now he isn't answering his phone.
- What happened?

He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

Oh.

I also mentioned
that he and I could live together,

but he was too mad at you to realize
what a great idea that is.

Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

I'm sure he's fine.

He probably just needs
a little alone time to decompress.

You're probably right.

So, what are you guys doing?

Well, Leonard cooked for me and now
we're just having a nice dinner,

you know, as a newly engaged couple.

That's nice.

Anyway, as I was saying,

Sheldon probably just
needs a little alone time.

'Cause that's important.

Not just for him, but for...

...most anybody, really.

Don't I know it.

- What is that, polenta?
- Amy, get out.

Right.

No.

Hey, Sheldon.

What happened?

I was cooking
in the back room last night

- and the hot plate caught on fire.
- And you couldn't put it out?

I was across the street
at the do-it-yourself car wash,

taking a shower.

So when will you reopen?

Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear
back from the insurance company.

So, tomorrow?

I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but,

my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

Your life?

The university is making me
do string theory,

and my girlfriend loves me
so much she wants to live with me.

And now, the place I need to go when
I'm sad is damp and smells funny.

Well, sorry I let you down.

No, I do not accept this.

Everything is changing and I hate it.

It stops now. I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

That'll be $2.99.

Really? It's soaking wet.

Fine, a dollar.

- Can you break a 20?
- No, I only have hundreds.

You know what?

I don't always recognize sarcasm,
but I do right now,

and I don't appreciate it.

I'm sorry for your loss.

But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

That could have killed me.

I can't catch a break.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

I haven't heard from Sheldon
in a while. You think he's okay?

Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

I'm gonna see where he is.

How?

I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

You do that?

Not always, but ever since
he wandered off at the swap meet

chasing a balloon, I get worried.

He can take care of himself.

Look, we went over stranger danger
and gave him that whistle.

That's weird.

- What?
- He's at the train station.

So? He loves trains.

It's dark out and he's alone,
I don't like it. Let's go get him.

Oh, it's sweet how you look out
for him. You're a good guy.

Not just that. My mother would kill
me if I let something happen to him.

- Dude, I'm so sorry.
- Don't take this the wrong way,

but did you do this
for the insurance money?

No. God, you sound
like the police, the firemen,

my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

Actually, I was wondering if I could
crash at your place for a few nights.

Sure, of course. Oh, actually,
Emily was gonna spend the night.

You slept with her? Nice.

Well, I can't take all the credit.
She let me do it to her, but...

But I can always
call her and cancel.

Hang on.
I know a place you can stay,

and earn some money at the same time.

- Great.
- I just have to warn you,

it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

So what's the catch?

Sheldon.

You tracked my phone?

Yeah.

Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

We were worried about you.

Don't be melodramatic.

I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

Seriously? You don't even have
a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

My plan is to stop
at malls and buy what I need.

It's called living off the land.

Okay, I know you're upset
and there's a lot of stuff going on,

but it's nothing we can't work out.
Come on, let's get you home.

No. I've reached my breaking point.
I need to leave. Now.

- And go where?
- It doesn't matter.

So a few things don't go your way,

and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

I suppose it is.

Except I have a credit card.

And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

Come on, come home with us and
tomorrow I'll take you to Legoland.

Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

And it's too much of a scene
since that movie came out.

- Then what can I do?
- Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

I need to get away and think.

Oh, come on,
you know you're overreacting.

Leonard, hang on.
Just... come here for a second.

Maybe we need to let him go.

- What! Why?
- It might be good for him.

You know he can't
take a trip like this by himself.

- He's a grown man.
- No, he looks like a grown man.

You've seen Freaky Friday,
sometimes little kids

end up in big person bodies.

Leonard,
we can't protect him forever.

- I know, but...
- He'll be okay.

You taught him well, Padawan.

Good Lord! Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

Seriously, let him go.

Sheldon, if you really need to
do this, I won't stand in your way.

I do.

Okay. Good luck.

Be safe and call us.

I will.

Bye, buddy.

- Sheldon...
- Yes?

I'm gonna miss you.

Of course you are.

He just made that easier.

Hey!

What are you guys still doing here?
I got this, go. Go home.

You sure?

Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,
she's all tucked in and watching TV.

So, she's not too much for you?

Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

WOMAN: Stewie, you gonna watch
Wheel of Fortune with me?

Coming, Debbie.

- You call her Debbie?
- She insisted.

So, hey, guys, thank you so much.

This job is a dream come true.

Was that a little weird?

Yeah.

I don't know why,
but something about it feels...

...unnatural.

- Okay, let's go.
- Yep.

Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

Talk to you tomorrow?

Okay, bye.

He's okay?

Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

Me too. And he was able
to take a sabbatical from...

How could you let him go!

(English US â SDH)

NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> The Big Bang Theory:

We were worried about you.

Don't be melodramatic.

I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

A few things don't go your way...

...and your best decision is
to ride the rails like a hobo?

Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

I need to get away and think.

- Sheldon.
- Yes?

I'm gonna miss you.

Of course you are.

- You just made that easier.
PENNY: Mm-hm.

Excuse me.

Is it at all possible
that you're knitting a pair of pants?

Oh, no. You're understandably terrified.

You know, allow me to explain.

Forty-five days ago...

...um, I embarked
on a railroad journey of healing...

...because my university
was making me do string theory...

...my favorite comic-book store
burned down...

...and when my roommate got engaged,
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me.

Which was no doubt a ploy just to see my...

...well, excuse my language,
but my bathing-suit parts.

Sir, may I use your phone?

I don't think so.

I understand that I'm half-naked...

...but there is a reasonable explanation.
While I slept in my sleeper car...

...all my possessions were stolen.

Now, typically, I wear pajamas...

...but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle...

...and pajamas are
the sleep-pants of the man.

I'll have you know
Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants...

...and a nation rallied behind him!

My good man, now, before you walk away,
I know that I may appear deranged...

...but I am, in fact,
a world-renowned physicist.

Ask me the difference between a boson
and a fermion. Go ahead, ask.

Bosons have integer spin.

Fermions have half-integer spin.

My legs are getting cold.
Why won't anybody help me?

- Morning.
- Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

Uh, let me just have some coffee first...

...and then I'll have the strength
to tell you how much I won't be doing that.

[PHONE RINGING]

- Hello?
- Hello, Leonard.

Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.

I'm in Kingman, Arizona...

...and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.

I'd love to, I'm just about
to do yoga with Penny.

Leonard, I'm at the police station.
I was robbed.

They took my phone,
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

I'm wearing borrowed pants...

...I don't have ID...

...and one of the officers here
won't stop calling me Chicken Legs.

Okay, I'll come get you.

- What's the address?
- Hey, what's going on?

- He got all of his stuff stolen.
SHELDON: <i>2530 E. Andy Devine Ave.</i>

- Okay.
SHELDON: <i>Hurry.</i>

Sheldon, hang tight.
Hey, do you want me to bring anything?

Yes, please. A pair of pants.

And my toothbrush.

And my mail. And a really good comeback
for Chicken Legs...

...because, "I know you are, but what am I?"
was met with stony silence.

I'll be there as soon as I can.

- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine. He's just a little rattled.

- Feel like driving to Arizona?
- I can't. I have that job interview.

- Right.
- Besides, I don't need six hours of:

"Your hair is different.
Why did you change?

I'm holding my breath
until your hair grows back."

All right, fine.

Can you think of a reason
I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?

- No.
- Come on, you didn't even try.

- Thanks for the lift.
- What's wrong with your car?

I'm having my windows untinted.

Why?

I got a hot girlfriend now.
I want the haters to know.

What are you talking about?
No one's paying attention to you.

Wow.

How's that Haterade taste, bro?

Hey, this isn't the way to work.

I just want to pop in
and make sure Ma's okay.

- I thought Stuart was looking after her.
- He was.

But now that her cast is off, he moved out.

And, honestly, I'm kind of glad.
It was getting a little weird.

- How so?
- I don't know.

They're chummy.

Like us?

No, not like us. Creepy chummy.

Like you and your dog.

She feeds him out of her own mouth?

I mean, he calls her Debbie,
she calls him Stewie...

...and they're all giggly around each other.

And believe me, when food goes
in that mouth, it does not come out.

So are you worried
because he's replacing you as a son...

...or are you worried
because he's becoming her lover?

First of all, no one can replace me as a son.

I'm her little matzo ball.

And secondly, my mother is well past
having any kind of sex life.

Okay, okay.

- Although, many older women lead vibrant...
- I said, well past it!

Excuse me, Officer Hernandez.

Any leads on the person
who stole my belongings?

- Not yet.
- Perhaps I can help.

Sherlock Holmes always says,
"When you eliminate the impossible...

...whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth."

Now, have you tried doing that?

Nope.

Well, maybe you should.

There's lots of books
called <i>Sherlock Holmes...</i>

...and there's no books
called <i>Officer Hernandez.</i>

Thanks again for coming.

Six hours was gonna be
a long drive by myself.

My pleasure.

I'm not angry
that my boyfriend was in trouble...

...and called you instead of me. I love that.

Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

I haven't been on a job interview in years.

- I'm really nervous.
- Don't be.

You are built for pharmaceutical sales.

You're cute, you're flirty and...

Started that like there were
gonna be three things.

I don't have any experience in sales...

...unless you count
the bikini car wash I did in school...

...but you already made me
take that off my rÃ©sumÃ©.

This job is a lot like being a waitress.

Except, instead of pushing fish tacos
because they'll go bad...

...you're pushing our antidepressants...

...before the FDA finds out
they may cause rectal bleeding.

They do?

Maybe.

Like our lawyers say, "The world is full
of things that can cause a rectum to bleed."

I talked you up to Dan.
He'll be interviewing you.

Ugh, I really appreciate this.
I just hope I'm not in over my head.

- You'll be fine. Just be yourself.
- I wish I felt more confident.

I wouldn't put you up for this
if you couldn't handle it.

- Thank you, but maybe I should cancel.
- It's too late to cancel, you're going.

But I don't know anything
about pharmaceuticals.

Oh, I understand. You wanna
do something you're already good at.

I know, why don't I get you a job...

...at the sitting-around-all-day-
wearing-yoga-pants factory?

They're comfortable.

Ma, I hope you're decent. Raj is here.
You just started seeing naked women again...

...and I don't want you to be confused
about where the boobs should be.

Oh. Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

Uh, what are you doing here?
I thought you moved out.

Oh, yeah. I was going to.

And then Debbie and I got to talking
over dinner the other night.

I didn't have any place to go,
she likes having me around...

...so we both said, "Why leave?"

At the same time. Ha-ha-ha.

Yeah, it was precious.

It's not that precious, heh.

I'd like to back you up,
but it sounds like it was pretty precious.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Stewie, I can't find my glasses.

Be right there, Deb-Deb.

Oh, they're probably on her head.

[CHUCKLES]

Or in her neck. Listen.

You staying here seems like something
she would've talked to me about.

Well, maybe if you called your mother
more often, you'd know.

[SCOFFS]

Wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.

[CHEWING LOUDLY]

Any word on my stolen items?

We're doing everything we can.

You know, Sherlock Holmes liked
to use cocaine to sharpen his focus.

But I'm sure those
Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.

Sheldon.

Leonard. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine. Why did you come?

What do you mean, why did I come?

You're my boyfriend.
I haven't seen you in over a month.

I just drove six hours to help you out.

Don't you have anything to say besides,
"Why did you come?"

I do, but I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud
in front of these police officers.

Fine. Whisper it.

[WHISPERS]
Shotgun.

So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip.
Where'd you go?

Where didn't I go?

I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta...

...Denver, Seattle.

How were they?

Oh, I have no idea.
I never left the train station.

Hang on. You traveled across the entire country
and never left a train station?

Why would I?
That's where all the cool trains are.

I'm sorry. So you never went outside?

Or had a single piece of fruit.

So why do you think you'd make
a good pharmaceuticals sales rep?

Well, I'm a people person.

People like me.
Some of my favorite people are people.

I feel like I'm saying "people" a lot.
People, people, people... Okay, I'm done.

You sure?

People. Yes.

Good. Ahem. So how do you feel
your previous job experience...

...has prepared you for a career like this?

Uh, well, as a waitress,
sales was a big part of my job.

Believe me, I convinced a lot
of very large customers...

...who should not be eating cheesecake
to have more cheesecake.

I mean, one of those chubsters
even had an insulin pump.

I have an insulin pump.

People.

It's weird, right?

A grown man in his 30s
living with my mother?

That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.

- Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?
- I don't know.

She's lonely, he needs a place to stay.
I doubt there's any funny business going on.

And even if there was, who cares?
They're both adults.

Who cares? You wouldn't care
if I slept with your mom?

You know what? You're my best friend
and she's in a bad marriage.

I give you my blessing.

This is stupid. I'm just gonna call
my mother and be honest with her.

Because that's what little matzo balls do.

[LINE RINGS]

STUART: <i>This is Debbie.</i>
MRS. WOLOWITZ: <i>And this is Stuart.</i>

[BOTH LAUGHING
ON ANSWERING MACHINE]

BOTH:
<i>Just kidding!</i>

STUART:
<i>Leave a message!</i>

[MACHINE BEEPS]

[WHISPERS]
This is the part where you talk.

All right, let's say a physician was
prescribing one of our competitor's drugs.

How would you convince them
to switch to ours?

Um...

Any chance his car needs
to be washed by a girl in a bikini?

No.

Okay, I'm really sorry for wasting your time.

Don't worry about it.
Thanks for stopping by.

Okay, thanks.

Um, I'm sorry...
Listen, could you do me a favor...

...and not tell Bernadette
how badly I blew this interview?

She'll get upset and honestly,
I'm a little terrified of her.

- Wait, you're scared of Bernadette?
- Yeah, kind of.

I thought it was just me!

No, no. Everyone thinks she's so nice
with her squeaky little voice.

I know. But she's kind of a bully.

Well, she is.

I didn't even want to meet you,
but I was too scared to say no to her.

Me too.

One time, I had... Whoa, ha, ha.

I had to tell her
we were cutting research funding...

- ...for one of the drugs she was developing.
- What happened?

I couldn't do it. She's still working on it.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Oh, we're not gonna tell her
about this, right?

- Oh, my God, no.
- No.

At the hot dog stand
in the Denver train station?

Heinz ketchup.

The hot dog stand
in the Salt Lake City train station?

Heinz ketchup.

The hot dog stand
in the Indianapolis train station...?

I don't care.

Wrong. Hunt's.

Hey, Amy. What do you say?
You ready to move on to the mustard round?

Have you not noticed
that I've been sitting back here...

...quietly stewing for the past two hours?

I just thought you were bad at the game.

I'm mad at you.

How could you go away
without even saying goodbye...

...and then call Leonard for help
instead of me?

Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy
to speak with my roommate?

We're in a moving car.

What do you expect me to do,
stick my fingers in my ears?

I was thinking put your head out
the window like a dog, but that'll work.

Please. This'll be quick.

Leonard, as soon as we get home...

...I want to have coitus with Amy.

Okay, she can't hear.

The reason I called you is because...

...I didn't want Amy to know
I couldn't make it on my own.

What's the big deal?

Of course it's no big deal to you.

You idolize me and nothing could ever
knock me off that pedestal you put me on.

It's true. You are a god to me.

- Can I stop now?
- Just tell her.

I called Leonard because I failed...

...and I didn't want you to think less of me.

You were worried about that?

Yes.

Sheldon.

It's okay with me that you're not perfect.

Can I have one more moment with Leonard?

Sure.

Amy just hurt my feelings.
I want to break up with her.

I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.

I never thought I'd say this,
but Penny got a job today.

- She did?
- Well, the only reason she got it...

...is because the guy
who interviewed her loves me.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

[CLEARS THROAT]

What do you want?

I, uh, kind of got the feeling...

...you might not be okay
with me staying at your mom's.

You're right, I'm not. I think it's weird...

- Howie.
- It is. He's a grown man.

He's just gonna live there rent-free?

How is that gonna motivate him
to get off his butt and get a job?

I mean, do you even have a plan?

Hey, you're not my father, okay?

And besides,
your mother and I were talking...

- "Your mother and I"? You're not my father.
- I didn't say I was your father.

- I didn't say I was your father.
- Calm down.

You're not his father, he's not your father.
Nobody is anybody's father.

I'm sorry you don't like my life choices,
but it's my life.

Well, it's my house, it's my rules.

Oh, ho! Okay, Dad.

If I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?

Don't take that sarcastic tone with him.

- I don't have to listen to you.
- Don't talk like that.

That is my mother...
Wife. My wife. I said my wife.

You know what?
This isn't getting us anywhere.

When you're ready to apologize,
you know where to find me.

Yeah, in my house!

STUART:
That's right, sucker!

I wish I'd never gone on that trip.

I feel no better now than when I left.

- But you still accomplished something.
- Yeah.

If you had told anyone you were going
on a train by yourself across the country...

...do you know what they would've said?

- That I couldn't do it?
LEONARD: Exactly.

Right after they said, "Yeah!"

But you did do it.
So what if it didn't all go your way?

That's what makes it an adventure.

That's a good point.

You know, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey.

He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger
than ever as Gandalf the White.

I was robbed of my phone and pants
and I, too, came back stronger.

And whiter too, because I wasn't
in direct sunlight for six weeks.

See? This trip was good for you.

Indeed.

I was the world's smartest caterpillar.

And then after pupating
in our nation's railway system...

...I have burst forth
as the world's smartest butterfly.

A butterfly could've gotten
himself home from Arizona.

Yeah, I feel renewed.

I'm ready to deal with any changes
that come my way.

- Hey. Look who's back.
- Hey.

Your hair is different. You changed your hair.
I can't take this. I'm out.

- Like to see pictures from my trip?
- I thought your phone got stolen.

It did, but luckily, all my photos
got backed up to the cloud.

And you thought they all had a silver lining.

Here, day one.

This was the seat I was going to sit in...

...but didn't because there were
cracker crumbs on it.

And as it was first class, I suspect Ritz.

This is the train bathroom.

This is the Imodium I took so I would
never have to use the train bathroom.

I can't believe you traveled the country
and never left the train station.

I know. You know, I almost died
in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put.

FYI, that's when the Imodium gave out.

[English - US - SDH]

I recently read that during World War II...

...Joseph Stalin had a research program
to create super soldiers...

...by having women impregnated by gorillas.

What a sick use of science.

Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.

I wonder if Stalin considered
any other animals.

Hippos are the deadliest creature.

A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.

Yes, but when they're hungry, hungry,
you can stop them with marbles.

Yeah, the correct animal
for interspecies super soldier is koala.

You would wind up with an army so cute,
it couldn't be attacked.

But half-man, half-owl can fly...

The answer is cuddly soldiers
with big flat noses. Moving on.

- So, Penny, when's the new job start?
- Next Monday.

Did you look over the materials I gave you?

- Uh, not yet, but I will.
- Great. When?

I said I'll get to it.

I'm sensing awkwardness. Am I right?

Yes.

Swish.

I don't want to be pushy, but you've
never done pharmaceutical sales before.

You could use this time to get a head start.

The first few weeks will be training.
They'll tell me everything I need to know.

Imagine how impressed they'd be if you
showed up familiar with the material.

So, what, you want me
to be like a teacher's pet?

Couldn't hurt.

I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt
because they were the teacher's pet?

It's like the rest of the class
wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.

Mrs. Davis...

- ...guess who.
- Dr. Cooper.

That's right. Good job.

[DOOR OPENS]

Hello. Uh...

You wanted to see me?

- Yes, welcome back.
- Thank you.

I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue...

...about the university forcing me
to continue with string theory?

You mean the dialogue that went,
"Please. No. Please. No. Please. No."?

That's the one.

I believe you went last, so please?

Dr. Cooper, while you were away...

...we came up with a solution that would
allow you to change your field of study.

Wow.

Pouting and running away actually worked.

I must say that may not be a lesson
you want to reinforce with me.

So, um, what is the solution?

Currently, you're being paid under a grant
to specifically research string theory.

If we promote you to junior professor,
you'll be able to choose...

...whatever field of research you'd like.

But if I'm a professor...

- ...then I'll have to teach a class.
- That is correct.

So your solution is to promote me...

...and pay me more money...

...so that I can impart my knowledge
to the next generation of scientists?

Yes.

You people are sick.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hey, ready to go to lunch?

Give me a minute. I'm stimulating
the pleasure cells of this starfish.

- I need to turn it off.
- What if you don't?

I have to sit through lunch knowing
this starfish is having a better day than I am.

Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?

- No, actually, I didn't invite her.
- How come?

Ever since she helped me get this job,
she won't stop bugging me.

Well, I think she just wants you to do well
and she's worried you won't...

...because you were just
a stunningly poor waitress.

That is not true.

I'm still waiting on my mini corn dogs
from two years ago.

I told you they'll be right out.

Okay, so no Bernadette.

Well, you saw her the other night.
Am I wrong?

No, I just...

I feel kind of uncomfortable talking
about her like this.

Usually when someone's
being talked about behind their back...

...it's me and it's right in front of my face.

- I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.
- I understand.

You know...

...there is some research that indicates...

...that sharing negative attitudes
about a third party...

...can be a powerful bonding force
between two friends.

- So, what are you saying?
- I'm saying, in the spirit of science...

...what is that little skank's problem?

So I've been trying to come up with
a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily.

What do you like better? Emipali?

Or Koothrapemily?

Why is it your last name
and her first name?

Well, her last name is Sweeney,
and something just didn't seem right about...

...Koothrapeeney.

Hey, how'd it go with Human Resources?

Awful. They're allowing me
to move on from string theory...

...but they made me a junior professor
and are requiring me to teach a class.

I don't understand.
Why is it bad you have to teach?

What a stupid question.

The kids are gonna love him.

I can't believe I have to waste my time
babysitting a bunch of grad students...

...who probably think dark matter
is what's in their diapers.

This might not be that bad.

- You like telling people they're wrong.
- Wrong.

Just because I enjoyed that one
doesn't mean I always do.

You enjoy giving people grades.

A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.

And you love the sound of your own voice.

Well, of course I do. Listen to it.

It's like an earful of melted caramel.

Most importantly,
this will let you move on and study dark matter.

[SIGHS]

It is true that many of my heroes
have taken students under their wings.

Feynman. Einstein. Professor X.

Humorously, in the case of Professor X...

...some of his students actually had wings.
That's rich. Heh-heh.

I'll use that one to lighten the mood
after my entire class fails the midterm.

Measuring starfish serotonin levels...

...in response to 1.2 molar stimulation
of pleasure cells.

You like that, don't you?

That's right, say my name.

[COMPUTER BEEPING]

<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, what's going on?

<i>Not much. You wanna get a drink later?
Just the two of us?</i>

- No Penny?
<i>- Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.</i>

Because you got her the job,
and she should be working harder to prepare?

<i>So it's not just me. You see it too.</i>

I do. I see it.

<i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

<i>Just this afternoon,
I saw an Instagram that instead of studying...</i>

<i>...she went out to lunch
and got a manicure.</i>

That's outrageous.

<i>- I know.</i>
- If she doesn't do well...

...this could reflect poorly on you.

<i>Exactly. Does she not realize it?
Or does she not care?</i>

I don't know.

The important thing is, I am here for you...

...so we can mutually disparage
this unpleasing third party.

Hey, we just wanted to see how your class
was going. Where is everybody?

There is no class.

Did you send everyone
to the principal's office already?

No one signed up.

Well, that's not your fault.

I called the department secretary
to see what happened.

Apparently, I have a reputation
for being obnoxious.

[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
What?

Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

No, it's fine.

Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.

- Oh, you bought cookies for everyone?
- Oh, yes.

Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them...

...which scientist both helped
to develop calculus...

...and had a famous cookie named after him.

Then after someone said Newton,
I was going to tell them they're wrong.

The cookies are named
after a town in Massachusetts.

And then I'd throw the cookies away.

Hey, what if I took your class?

Why would you do that?

- Why would you do that?
- What is wrong with you?

I've been thinking about getting my doctorate,
and he wants to teach. Why not?

Oh. Howard, I appreciate the gesture.

But this is a graduate-level physics class.

I don't think you'd understand
a single thing I was talking about.

Ask, "Why not?" again. I've got an answer.

Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough
to take your class.

[CHUCKLING]
No.

Yes.

How would you determine the ground state
of a quantum system with no exact solution?

Guess a wave function and vary its parameters
until I found the lowest energy solution.

Hmm.

Do you know how to integrate X squared
times E to the minus X without looking it up?

I'd use Feynman's trick,
differentiate under the integral sign.

Okay.

SHELDON:
Uh...

What is the correct interpretation
of quantum mechanics?

Every interpretation gives the same answer
to every measurement. They're all correct.

You believe in the many worlds
interpretation, so I'll say that.

Now do you think I'm smart enough?

No.

Oh, come on. You might have gone
to school for a couple more years than me.

But guess what,
engineers are just as smart as physicists.

Ah! You take that back.

No.

So after drinks with Bernadette, I get home,
and Penny calls to complain about her.

And while I'm taking to Penny,
I get a text from Bernadette.

I am trying to prepare my lesson plan
for Howard.

Why are you telling me this?

Because it's taken 15 years,
but high school is finally awesome.

I love them both...

...but I'm in the center now,
and I love that even more.

Amy, please.

I am trying to figure out a way...

...to intellectually emasculate
a dear friend of mine.

- But I'm just...
- Not now.

You better watch that attitude, buddy.
You're dating the popular girl now.

[DOOR OPENS]

You're up late.

I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

He is going to be so lost.

Look at this section over here.

Even I don't really understand it.

Sheldon, why are you doing this?

I'm a teacher, Leonard. It's my job.

No, why are you going to so much trouble
to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?

Oh, it's no trouble. It's actually a pleasure.

Wanna know what I think?

I think the idea that someone could be
as smart as you or even smarter...

...scares the pants off you,
and you can't deal with it.

Interesting point.

But you're suggesting that I have emotional
issues below my consciousness...

...which drive my behavior.

Thus causing me to lash out
at anything or anyone...

...that threatens my intellectual superiority.

Might be something to think about.

- Leonard.
- Yeah.

Howard's allergic to peanuts.
How can I use that against him?

Hey.

Okay, now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

Before we do, I just talked to Leonard.

And, heh, if you're gonna spend
all your time trying to belittle me...

...by making this class unnecessarily hard,
then I'm out.

If you're interested in making
a sincere effort to be a good teacher...

...then I'm willing to give this a shot.

I suppose that's a fair request.

There's no reason we both can't benefit
from this experience.

- Okay.
- Okay.

Well, then, first things first.

Are you familiar
with the Brachistochrone Problem?

- I am.
- Good.

And how it relates
to the calculus of variations?

- It's an inverted cycloid.
- Wonderful.

- Now what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
- That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

Ha! I knew it. All right. Now.

We have a lot of information
to cover before your first test.

Which, by the way, is in eight minutes.

The good news is I'm grading on a curve,
so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.

[SINGING]
<i>All I do is win, win, win, no matter what</i>

What are you doing?

<i>Everybody's hands go up, up</i>

<i>And they stay there</i>

- What are you doing?
- If you're gonna be a crappy teacher...

...then I'm gonna be a crappy student.

<i>Ungh, ungh, Ludacris going in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I...</i>

Stop it.

This is a classroom.
This is not <i>American Bandstand.</i>

Okay, now where was I?
Let's see. Oh, yes, over here.

What are you doing now?

I'm making a straw.

- Why?
- So I can shoot you with a spitball.

You're not going to do that,
and I'll tell you why.

This is an institution of higher learning.

I am your professor,
and you're going to treat me with the prop...

[GAGS]

You shot your spit in my mouth.

Is that gonna be on the test?
Because I don't think I can do that again.

Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a "what what"?

What?

Close enough. Um...

I was just calling
to see what you were up to.

Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine.
Maybe sneak in some pinot gris? Whatevs.

Oh, thanks, but I'm gonna stay in
and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.

Oh.

Oh, I hear you.
Try and get that nag off your back, right?

I mean, you're not a bicycle.
Why she riding you like that?

I think she was just trying to help.
Plus, I really want to do well at this job.

Okay, good luck, and call me later.

You know, if you decide
she's a bitch or something.

Hey, girlfriend.

- Hey, Amy.
- Tonight. You. Me. Color Me Mine.

Maybe we sneak in some pinot.
Make it Color Me Wine.

That sounds fun, but I promised Penny
I'd come by and help her study.

Oh, well, good luck getting her to do that.
She's probably out getting another manicure.

You remember when she did that?
You remember?

I was probably being too hard on her.
We talked. We're good.

Oh, great. I'm happy for you guys.

When the two of you aren't getting along,
it puts me in a really weird position.

Don't worry. Everything's back to normal.

You mean like where she's nice to your face?
Okay, got it. Bye.

Hey, boyfriend.

Can't talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.

[GURGLING]

- Well?
- Sheldon, I promise...

...your uvula does not have an STD.

Are you sure?

It doesn't feel as innocent as it used to.

You reported me to Human Resources?

You violated the sanctity of my mouth.

Well, I dropped your class,
so I hope you're happy.

I told you, you weren't smart enough
to take it.

I'm smart enough. Asking me about a topic
I'm not familiar with doesn't prove anything.

I could do the same to you.

- Try me.
- Okay.

You enjoy making fun
of engineering so much.

How do you quantify the strength
of materials?

Young's modulus.

- Is that right?
- Yeah.

Okay, how do you prevent
eddy currents in a transformer?

Laminate the core material.

- Come on, give him a hard one.
- That was a hard one.

All right, how does the flow rate
in a pipe depend on its diameter?

[CHUCKLING]
You don't know, do you?

[SHELDON GASPS]

What's the matter, smart guy?
Don't know Poiseuille's Law?

[COUGHING]

Thank goodness, I got it.

Now I can quit checking my stool.

Okay, what are the potential side effects
for our erectile dysfunction drug?

- Headaches, dizziness, and nausea.
- Yes.

Those are also the side effects...

...of having a 75-year-old man
with an erection climb on top of you.

- Want to stop here?
- Uh, no, I can keep going.

No, you got this.
Let's go for a drink. I'll call Amy.

Good. She seemed like
she really wanted to go out tonight.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Hey, girl.

Okay, next question. For the Butterfinger...

...how long is a galactic year?

- Two-hundred-and-fifty million years.
- Yes.

ALL: Yay!
- You got it.

Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.

Ah! It's not even Easter time. This is crazy.

Which Archimedean solid
has 20 regular triangular faces...

...30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces...

...60 vertices, and 120 edges.

ALL [IN UNISON]:
The rhombicosidodecahedron.

- Yes.
ALL: Yay!

- We are so smart.
- Why didn't girls like us in high school?

- We were awkward, weird, couldn't play sports.
- Right again.

[ALL CHEER]

[English - US - SDH]

So how does this work?
I throw it like a real ball?

Yeah, nice and easy, right over the plate.

All right.

You suck, Wolowitz.

What's that about?

I'm heckling you.
It's a beloved part of baseball.

He's right.
Given that you're probably still waiting...

...to be picked for a game in fifth grade,
I'm sure you do suck.

- Hi. What's going on?
- Baseball.

Okay, this is not what I meant
when I said go outside and play.

- He's practicing.
- For what?

The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out
the first pitch. So guess who they called?

What? You? Really?

Well, a lot of people who weren't available,
but then me.

That's so cool. Congratulations.
I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.

Well, not just him.
May I remind you that you're talking...

...to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy
of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.

Watching your boyfriend run around
with a broomstick between his legs...

...isn't something you forget.

- Come on. Now, throw one.
- All right, here we go.

You look like a jackass!

- Cut it out. You're hurting my feelings.
- Now you know why we're not outside.

Did you enjoy my lecture?

No, and neither did our waiter.

If you're going to serve Cornish game hen...

...you should be familiar with the history
of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.

It's hard to argue with that.

And I know because I saw a sad man
with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.

- Hey. How was dinner?
- Good, I had Cornish game hen.

Oh, that poor waiter.

- Sheldon, how about tomorrow we see a movie?
- You guys are going out two nights in a row?

I missed a number of date nights
while I was on my train trip.

I'm contractually obligated to make them up
under the terms of the relationship agreement.

That's so hot.

It's better than hot, it's binding.

If you're free tomorrow night,
I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

Aw.

You are aware that a double date
doesn't count as two dates.

Oh.

Well, then come or don't. I don't care.

Can't believe you're sore.

Hey, even professional pitchers
need a rubdown after the game.

They throw an actual ball.
You were throwing air at a TV.

For your information,
I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.

I'm surprised you agreed to do this
in front of a stadium full of people.

Well, they're doing Space Day and NASA
asked me. I felt like I couldn't say no.

Okay. If you want, I could help you practice.
I played a lot of softball growing up.

Thank you, that would be great.

While we're at it, maybe we can butch up
your run for when you head to the mound.

What's wrong with the way I run?

Just kidding. Nothing.

Sheldon, I'm surprised
you'd choose to go to a pub.

At our committee meeting,
Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park...

...but I tacked so many amendments
on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.

I then suggested a pub.

Yeah, which I was initially skeptical of until
I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.

You don't like Yorkshire pudding.

No, it's yucky, but informing people about
the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum, yum.

After a lively debate,
that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.

Nice to see a busy couple
keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.

SHELDON:
Ignore them, Amy.

They're just jealous because they'll never
have a relationship as good as ours.

PENNY: Isn't this when he says
"bazooka" or something?

SHELDON:
I wasn't making a joke...

...I was merely stating facts.

Amy and I
have a superior relationship to yours.

You don't honestly think that, do you?

Leonard, I assumed you knew.

The ranking of relationships
in our circle, by quality...

...is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his girlfriend...

...Penny and chardonnay, Penny and you.

LEONARD:
There isn't any ranking.

And if there were,
we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.

Yeah. And actually, I drink sauvignon blanc.

That's the part you have a problem with?

Relax.

AMY:
There they go, fighting again.

You'd never hear her
talk that way to sauvignon blanc.

So you never played baseball as a kid?
Not even Little League?

I was going to, but the day of tryouts
I found my dad's <i>Playboy</i> collection.

Threw my arm out.

All right, the pitcher's mound
in Major League Baseball...

...is 60 feet, 6 inches away from home plate.

Great. You take this and say when to stop.

- How much further?
- Keep going.

- How about now?
- I'll let you know.

Are you saying "stop"
and we're just too far away to hear you?

Okay, stop.

Are you kidding me?

That's 60 feet.

There's no way this is 60 feet.

I'm looking at it.

You realize this isn't one of those times I want
you to exaggerate how long something is.

Okay, I gotta... I just... I gotta ask.

What makes you think your relationship
is so wonderful and ours isn't?

For starters,
we enjoy spending time together.

So do we.

And I've seen you guys ignore each other
for hours doing totally different things.

It's called "parallel play."

Yeah, toddlers do that.

Not as well as we do.

Can you believe this guy?
He has to be the best at everything.

So what? Why do you even care?

Oh, listen to them.
Not even married and the honeymoon's over.

Whatever. You can't even go on a date
without checking your relationship agreement.

If you've got a problem
basing a relationship on a contract...

...I'd like to tell you about
13 plucky colonies that entered...

...a relationship agreement
called the U.S. Constitution.

And it may not be cool to say so, but I think
that love affair is still pretty hot today.

It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear
right now because there's about to be a fire.

[MOUTHS]
<i>What?</i>

Okay. It's not that hard.
You just look to where you wanna throw it...

...step towards where you wanna throw,
and throw it.

That's your help? That's like saying,
"Here's how you fly a plane...

...get in the airplane,
know where you wanna go, and fly it."

Just throw the ball.
Let's see what we're working with.

Come on, Howard, fire it in.

Throw the damn ball!

[POP MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

So when do you guys plan
on getting married?

We're not sure. But I want to wait long enough
to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.

- May I have one of your fries?
- Of course.

Can I have a bite of your burger?

Absolutely not.

Some perfect couple.
He won't even share food with her.

It has avocado on it.
She's allergic to avocado.

Are you so jealous of our relationship
you want Amy to die?

I'm not jealous. I just think it's silly for you...

...to compare relationships
like they're something that can be quantified.

Everything is quantifiable.

That french fry? A seven.

Spider-Man? A nine.

The number nine? Oddly, only a four.

- How ridiculous is he?
- A hundred.

Sheldon, you're just assigning random
numbers to things based on your opinion.

No, I'm not. French fries have three variables:
crispiness, saltiness and shape.

Which is why a curly fry only gets a two.

If I wanted curls for dinner
I'd order a clown wig.

Well, a relationship is more complicated
than a french fry.

Not according to the work
of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

Oh, what did those rascals do now?

They developed
the Relationship Closeness Inventory...

...which predicts the stability of a couple
based on behavior.

Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry
Goodness Inventory. That's pure Cooper.

So this is accurate?

It's been around for 25 years...

...and has been extensively corroborated
by other researchers.

Kind of takes the romance
out of relationships.

Kind of? It does it perfectly.

Sheldon and I got an 8.2 out of 10.

Fine. We'll take it right now.

- No, don't.
- What?

- Just don't take it.
- Why not?

It's stupid.
Who cares what number it is?

- Come on, it'll be fun.
- I don't want you to.

I'm getting another drink.

Sorry.

I'm gonna let you count this as two dates.
They're a lot of work.

You think he's getting any better?

Yep.

HOWARD:
That was a close one.

Okay.

- Is it too late for him to cancel?
- I think so.

HOWARD:
Heads-up. Watch out.

- Are you mad at me?
- No, stop being stupid.

Um, phew.

Is this about the test or is this about us?

I don't need a test to make me worry about
something I'm already worried about.

What are you worried about?

That we're engaged and have nothing
in common and it scares me.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

Yeah, that scares me too.

- It does?
- Sometimes.

Well, that's not good.

You being blindly infatuated with me was
the rock we were building this relationship on.

Okay, well, this might make you feel better.

Uh, we're both scared
that our marriage will be a disaster...

...and so that's something
that we have in common.

Also, we both think I'm not funny. Heh-heh.

Huh? See, you're not laughing.

[LINE RINGS]

<i>Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?</i>

Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me
to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game.

You got any advice?

<i>Yeah, don't do it.</i>

<i>What else you up to?</i>

Why shouldn't I do it?

<i>There's no upside.
If you do well, no one cares.</i>

<i>And if you screw up,
you're an idiot on YouTube forever.</i>

But it's for a good cause.
What about all the kids that'll be there?

<i>That's what I'm telling you.
Kids are the worst.</i>

<i>My own daughter tweeted
I have a giant nose.</i>

Well, maybe I'll do a good job. Heh.

<i>I don't know. In space you couldn't even
toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.</i>

Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

<i>Anytime, Froot Loops.</i>

<i>Give your wife a hug for me.</i>

<i>She's so much cuter than you,
I don't know how you ever got her.</i>

He's so nice.

Hey. Sorry about that.

No, we're sorry. We never should have been
comparing relationships in the first place.

Why? We won.

I say next we take on
Koothrappali and his dog.

Really give ourselves a challenge.

I just want to say one more thing.

Just because Penny and I are very different
people does not mean we're a bad couple.

The answer is one simple test away.

You know, it's like when I thought
there was a possum in my closet.

Did I sit around wondering? No.

I sent Leonard in
with a pointy stick and a bag.

I killed his Chewbacca slippers.

- Let's just take the test.
- No, no, I don't want to.

- Because you know we're gonna do bad.
- It doesn't matter.

I don't care if we're a 10 or a two.

Or a one. A one is possible.

Marriage is scary.

You're scared, I'm scared.
But it doesn't make me not want to do it.

It just makes me want to hold your hand
and do it with you.

Leonard.

It would make me so happy
if you said things like that.

We got an 8.2. Trust me, you're happy.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

Mm. I love how they put
a waterfall at center field.

It really ties the whole stadium together.

Look at you talking sports.

This is fun, huh? Get to see our friend
throw out the first pitch...

...have a hot dog, watch the game.

Whoa.

Nobody said anything
about watching the game.

Sheldon, what did you expect?

I expected to see Howard throw the baseball,
finish my hot dog...

...and hightail it across the street to Disneyland
just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.

I'll tell you what, if we stay,
I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.

Who's the bobblehead of?

Does it matter?

No, as long as it bobbles.

Howie, I am so proud of you.

Thanks, I'm proud of me too.

You ready?

- Let's do it.
ROY: All right.

[HOWARD SIGHS]

- Wish me luck.
- Go get them.

ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>in honor of Space Day at Angel Stadium...</i>

<i>...the first pitch will be thrown out
by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.</i>

[CHEERING]

Thank you. Thank you.

Can he really throw a ball?

- On our Quidditch team...
- Yeah, that's a no.

I have a message
for the young people here today.

When I was asked to throw the first pitch...

...a little voice in my head
said I couldn't do it.

So I practiced and practiced,
and you know what?

That little voice, ha, was right. But...

...then I remembered that I'm not an athlete.

I'm a scientist.

So today's first pitch
will be delivered to home plate by science.

Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, I present to you...

...a working prototype of the Mars Rover.

[CROWD CLAPPING]

LEONARD: Whoa!
RAJESH: Wow!

Whoo!

And here's the wind-up, and the pitch.

[WHIRRING]

Why is it going so slow?

Because I'm an idiot
who didn't think this through.

Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland...

...play hide-and-seek
on Tom Sawyer's Island...

...and then come back
and see the end of the pitch.

[CROWD BOOING]

Okay, while we're waiting for the ball to arrive,
here's some fun facts about Mars.

RAJESH:
You suck, Wolowitz!

He makes a valid point!

[CROWD CONTINUES BOOING]

Okay, booing isn't gonna
make it go any faster!

[English - US - SDH]

Have you guys heard about
this research team...

...that's trying to transgenically manipulate
chicken DNA...

...to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?

I think that sounds wonderful.

What?
You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.

Yes, but tell me a dinosaur-chicken salad
sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

[LAUGHING]

- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

- We still on for tomorrow night?
- Yeah. I'm excited to meet your girlfriend.

Speaking of which, according to
a recent study out of Oxford University...

...when someone takes on
a new romantic partner...

...that person loses one or two close friends.

Since when do you read social science?

I go to the bathroom like everybody else.

Why would I lose friends
just because I started dating?

You didn't lose any when you met Amy.

Well, no, the study refers
to romantic partners.

Not the way
I would categorize the two of us.

- But you guys kiss and hold hands.
- I've seen them do it. It's not romantic.

Look, I'm not the kind of guy who drops
his friends just because he's in a relationship.

- What happens if she doesn't like us?
- Well, hey, you're my dear friends.

You'll get a Christmas card for a couple
of years and then you're dead to me.

So, Howard, is Stuart
still living with your mom?

- I don't wanna talk about it.
- But he's going to.

My mom got him cable!

My whole life growing up in that house,
no cable.

Do you know how many HBOs
that leech had my mother get him? Seven.

Seven HBOs. Seven.

Long story short, they have seven HBOs.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

- Emily, you know most everybody.
- Hi.

- This is Leonard. This is Penny.
- It's nice to meet you.

- Nice to finally meet you too.
- Hi.

Hello.

Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.

I told you she exists.

I hear you're a dermatologist.

Yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.

Oh! I like their emergency room.

Even if it turns out you don't have dengue
fever, they still let you take a lollipop.

You know, Penny just started training
to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

- Maybe she could practice on you sometime.
- It would be great to practice on a real doctor.

Yeah, I'm sure that'd be fine.

I have some odd freckles on my buttocks.

Can I make an appointment
for you to look at them?

Um, okay, I guess.

I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with
him two minutes and he's taking his pants off.

Last night was fun.
What'd you think of Emily?

I don't know. I kind of got
the sense she didn't like me.

Did she say she didn't like you?

Of course not. No one says
they don't like you straight to your face.

We have led different lives.

You guys just met.
Why would she feel that way?

It's just this vibe I got.

- I'm sure you're worried about nothing.
- Probably right.

I used to think my PE teacher didn't like me,
but it turned out she liked me a little too much.

- Really?
- Yeah, it was fine.

We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert,
I got an A, it all worked out.

When you go to Emily's office to practice
you'll see it's fine.

Yeah, I hope you're right.

You really went your entire life without anyone
saying, "I hate you," to your face?

Yeah.

I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]

I miss Stuart's place.

All this loud music and exposed brick.

Is this a comic book store
or a rave at the third little pig's house?

Yeah, I wish Stuart would reopen,
I hate this place too.

Okay, him I believe because he's an
80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

You're just upset about Stuart
and your mom and all their HBOs.

Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch
<i>Game of Thrones</i> now...

...without thinking of my mother saying:

[IMITATING HIS MOTHER]
"Stuart, which one is Thrones?"

He might not reopen. He didn't get a lot
of money from the insurance company.

Oh, boy, if there's one thing that gets my goat,
it's those dad-gum insurance companies.

Why, because they won't get off your lawn?

Is Stuart trying to get a loan
or find investors?

All I know is he's got my mother
buying four-ply toilet paper.

I mean, four-ply.

If his butt is so delicate
why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?

For starters, they shed and bite.

Hey, here's a thought. Why don't we put up
the rest of the money that Stuart needs?

So we'd be, like, owners
of a comic book store?

Kind of a dream come true.

It does sound fun.

Maybe we could come up with a business plan
to compete with this place.

I'll give you a plan right now.

Step one, open comic book store.

Step two, start rumor this comic book store
gives you genital warts.

Step three, buy a big bag
to put the money in.

It's not that bad.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Thanks for letting me practice
my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.

- Sure.
- I brought coffee.

I wasn't sure what you like so I got a regular,
a cappuccino and a chai tea.

Since you like Raj,
I thought you might be into that.

Thanks. If we could get started,
I'm a little busy.

Yeah, sure, let me just get out my materials.

Leonard gave me this.
He used to carry it around in high school.

You can still see the dent
where they whacked him with it.

Ahem. Okay, I would like to talk to you about
our new birth-control pill, Femivra.

Great.

So Femivra's triphasic design
provides balanced hormonal exposure.

All right.

It has also been shown to cause significantly
fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.

Although it can cause acne.

Which, if you ask me, kind of increases
its effectiveness as a contraceptive.

Funny.

Okay, I'm sorry, did we get off
on the wrong foot?

Since the other night, I feel like
you might have a problem with me.

No, it's fine.

Are you sure? Because it doesn't seem fine.

Okay, if you really wanna talk about this...

- ...I do have a problem.
- Oh, my God. Tell me. What did I do?

Look, it's nothing, it's just Raj told me
that a while ago you two hooked up.

What? Why would he say that?

Did it not happen?

Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hookup.

- Did you kiss?
- Yeah.

Were you naked?

Yeah.

- So it was a hookup.
- No.

Yeah.

So, what are some ways we can set our
comic book store apart from the competition?

Kids buy comic books. It'd be great
to figure out a way to get more kids in.

You know, when I was a kid I loved
going there, but I could never get a ride.

Ooh, what if we got a van
and drove around and picked kids up?

Nice.

Like at parks and schools.

Toy stores, puppet shows.

Hold on, so your idea is to get a van and cruise
the streets looking for kids to pick up?

Yes.

And are you gonna use candy
to lure them in?

We are now.

You told Emily we hooked up?

Uh, well, in my defense, I tell everybody.

Why would you say that?

We had a conversation about past lovers.

We weren't lovers, didn't sleep together.

We got drunk and fooled around.
Why couldn't you leave me out of it?

We were being honest.

You'd leave me out of a conversation
with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

- Why say it?
- Yes.

Well, I would never leave you off my list.

And not just because without you we're playing
fast and loose with the word "list."

Well, good job, now she hates me.

Great.

On the bright side, that Oxford study was right.
One friend down.

I wonder who you're going to lose next.

You, okay? It's you. You're next.

No, you're crazy about me.

I don't know what Emily's so upset about.

Even if I had slept with him, so what?
Everyone has a past.

- Ahem.
- Almost everyone has a past.

Come on, look how pretty you are.
I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.

It's not.

And I'm sure you can turn it around.

How? You can't force someone to like you.

What if you just hang around and act
like her friend until you wear her down?

I mean, next thing you know, you're in her
home, eating her food, drinking her wine.

- No, that won't work.
- You're right. Cheers.

I know. Why don't you use your sales training
to go back down there and sell yourself?

- What?
BERNADETTE: Yeah.

But instead of selling a drug,
you'd be selling Penny.

- It's cute.
- It's stupid.

Well, maybe people would like you more
if you didn't crap all over their ideas.

I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.

Then again, why wouldn't I?
I mean, we go way back.

Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.

Shh. Amy's here now. Shh.

The more I think about it, the more intrigued
I am about having our own store.

We'll get to see all the new stuff
before it hits the shelves.

And we'll get to have fun interactions
with our customers.

"This isn't a library. Buy it or get out."

You say things like that all the time.

Yes, but as an owner, I'll finally have a good
comeback to, "You don't work here, shut up."

Do you know how Penny told Raj
he should have left her off his list?

Yeah.

Think when she and I had that conversation
she left people off hers?

I'm sure she did.

Why?

Because if she hadn't,
she'd still be wading through the list.

Will you stay out of this?

Heh. If only Penny had said that
once in a while.

What difference does it make?
You're the one she wants to marry.

- That's true.
- I'm not sure...

...that complete honesty
is always the best thing for a relationship.

Yeah, he's right.
Once, in a moment of candor...

...I told Amy that her hair
reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill.

She stormed out.

Which was sad,
because we were playing Scrabble...

...and I had all the letters
to spell "persimmon."

Why are you even part of this conversation?
You don't know anything about women.

I know that if I had a wife or a fiancÃ©e...

...I'd ask her first
before I invested money in a comic book store.

[SIGHS]

- He's right.
- Well, of course I am.

I was also right about her hair.
It did everything but quack.

Hey, there's something
I wanted to run past you.

What's up?

Well, the guys and I were thinking about
investing in Stuart's comic book store.

Is that okay?

Why are you asking me?

Well, we're engaged
and it's kind of a big deal financially.

Seems like something we should talk about.

Oh.

Well, would you consider mounds of credit
card debt kind of a big deal financially?

LEONARD:
Yeah.

PENNY:
Huh.

So me and the guys were talking
about this great investment opportunity...

Nope.

But you didn't hear what it was.

I know.

Oh, come on.

- Fine. What is it?
- It's to help reopen the comic book store.

Nope.

Hear me out.

Howie, you know we're saving up
for a house.

I know, but all the guys are doing it.

We're splitting it four ways
so it's really not that much money.

Just seems like a risky investment.

I get that.

Okay, look.

The real reason this is important is...

[CLEARS THROAT]

...before my dad left me and my mom...

...he used to take me
to the comic book store.

It was one of the few things we did together.

Howie, I had no idea.

Well, I don't like to talk about it.

Oh, baby.

That story's made-up, isn't it?

That's how much buying
a comic book store means to me.

I'd like your honest opinion on something.

Of course.

Now, before I start, I need you to know
that I'm very excited about this.

And anything you say
that isn't enthusiastically supportive...

...will throw our entire relationship
into question.

So keep an open mind.

I'm feeling a little backed into a corner,
Sheldon.

Perfect.

Now, I'm considering investing
in Stuart's comic book store.

Interesting.

Can you see how a grown man,
an accomplished scientist...

...who invests in a store that sells picture
books about flying men in colorful underwear...

...might be wasting both his financial
and intellectual resources?

No.

Then I think it's a terrific idea.

Great.

Wait till you hear about our van.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Hey. Thanks for inviting us over.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.

Listen, Penny, before you start...

...I wanna apologize for being so rude
the other day in my office.

- No, no. No need to apologize.
- Excuse me, can I say something?

I just love both you guys
and I want you to get along.

And when I say "love," I meant as a friend.

And, uh, we're too soon, right?

Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily...

...what happened between me and Raj
was a long time ago.

I made it seem like
a bigger deal than I should have.

Yeah. And Leonard and I are engaged now.

And I'm just hoping
we can put this whole thing behind us.

I'd like that too.

Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it,
but then I saw how pretty you are.

Oh. That's so sweet.
I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.

It's true, you're both gorgeous.

Kind of says something about the man
who could bed you both.

[CHUCKLES]

You get why I've been alone
most of my adult life.

So, what brings you by?

Well, I don't need a reason, it's my house.

Technically it's your mom's house,
but we certainly want you to feel welcome.

I'm always welcome.

Just try and call first.

Okay, let's get down to business.

Howie was thinking about putting up
some money to help reopen the store...

...but before that happens,
I have a few questions.

I appreciate the offer, but actually,
your mother already gave me the money.

What?

Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said
she was happy to help out her <i>bubala.</i>

[CHUCKLES]

Excuse me.

Ma, you are canceling that check...

...and Stuart is not your <i>bubala,</i> I'm your
<i>bubala,</i> you can't have more than one <i>bubala!</i>

I don't know who he's talking to,
she's at Target buying me shirts.

I'm so glad we could work this all out.

Yeah, me too.

We should have dinner
with you and Leonard.

- We would love that.
- Great.

- Okay, good night, guys.
- All right, night.

Bye.

BOTH:
I hate her.

I'm disappointed we're not gonna have
our own comic book store.

I was looking forward to it.

Would have been nice
to have a place that's ours.

Where we could just sit
and read comics in peace.

With comfy seats.

And snacks.

I guess it was too good to be true.

Yeah.

[ALL SIGH]

[English - US - SDH]

Hey, I read that someone invented
a way to convert your footsteps...

...into electromagnetic energy so you can
charge your cell phone while walking.

We had that idea years ago.
How come we never did anything with it?

Because we left the diagram of it in the
restaurant and none of us wanted to walk back.

I know the real reason
you never made progress with that idea.

You thought of it September 22nd, 2007.

Two days later, Penny moved in...

...and so much blood rushed to your genitals
your brain became a ghost town.

That's not what happened.

I remember it distinctly because I had just
composed my annual poem commemorating...

- ...the anniversary of Dr. Seuss' death.
- No one wants to hear it.

<i>Why, die?</i>

<i>Why did he die?</i>

<i>Old, told
I was told he was old</i>

Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

Easy. Sleeping with Penny.

Getting Penny to go out with him
after she dumped him.

Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

I think someone owes me an apology.

Well, don't feel bad.

I think we've all been distracted
since the girls entered our lives.

- You admit Amy's a distraction?
- Oh, very much so.

Listen to this. This is from two days ago.

"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

Who has time for this constant sexting?

Maybe we have lost our focus.

It wouldn't kill us to get together
and brainstorm ideas.

Ooh. We could have one of those retreats.

Like our own science retreat.

- My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
- I'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

Did you see the movie <i>Cabin in the Woods?</i>

- Then we'll go to a hotel.
- A hotel?

Did you see <i>The Shining?</i>

We could go up to Big Bear,
get a house on the lake.

Did you see <i>The Lake House?</i>

Nothing bad happens in <i>The Lake House.</i>

Well, no, not to them. To me.

Time-traveling mailbox.

The only time that traveled was
an hour and a half of my life down the toilet.

- Fine. We'll stay here and do it.
- You didn't suggest a beach house.

- You would go to a beach house?
- Well, good Lord, no. Have you seen <i>Jaws?</i>

- Hey.
- Hey.

So the guys and I are talking about
having a science retreat this weekend.

I wanted to know if that's okay.
You and I talked about going to brunch.

- Wanna go to Vegas this weekend?
- Of course I do.

- Bernadette, girl's weekend, Vegas. You in?
- Yeah.

- Yes. I'll check flights.
- I'll check hotels.

I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited I think I peed.

They seem okay with it.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- I didn't think you'd make it.
- Why not?

You have a steady girlfriend now.

We assumed you'd have to stay home
to lower the food down to her in the pit.

For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

One would assume
on getting out of the pit.

Okay, let's focus.

The girls are gone, we have 48 hours,
there are no distractions.

- Let's change the world.
- Thinking caps on.

- Here we go.
- Ooh. This is exciting.

We're innovating.
I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

- Oh. I never saw that.
- Really?

It's wonderful. And I swear I'm not saying that
because Justin Timberlake is in it.

Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

We should watch it.

Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

Guys, in 30 seconds we went from
"Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."

I'm sorry, is that a no?

Leonard's right. We're here to focus.
Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?

I think I still have it.

I did not get a clear answer.
I'm gonna set this down now.

Ah. Here it is.

Heh. Whoa.

I haven't looked at these in years.

- "Robot girlfriend."
- Mmm. That was mine.

"Robot prostitute."

Also mine.

I'm confused. Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?

There's just some things you don't do
with your robot girlfriend.

Boy, when you met Bernadette,
the field of robotics really took a hit.

Okay, let's just skip all the inventions
you can have sex with.

Here we go.

- "Ergonomic heated seat cushion."
- It vibrates. Keep going.

Know what?
Let's just come up with something new.

You know, a number of significant innovations
have been inspired by science fiction.

The geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

The Motorola flip phone,
that came from <i>Star Trek.</i>

And I have long suspected that the idea
of an African-American president...

...was stolen from the movie <i>Deep Impact.</i>

Hey, the future they show
in <i>Back to the Future II...</i>

...is only a year away. A lot of things
in that movie haven't been invented yet.

How cool would it be
if we could make one of those?

If we could figure out the scientific basis
for Marty's hoverboard...

...that would have universal application.

It's possible at absolute zero, but we would
have to remove the temperature restrictions.

- Oh, I have an idea.
- I think I have the same one.

We gotta watch <i>Back to the Future II.</i>

I'll make the popcorn.

- So where should we go first?
- Ooh.

- There's a cover band in the lounge.
- Nah.

- But they play Barry Manilow.
- No.

But they're called Fairly Manilow.

- Oh, okay.
- Great.

No.

- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Well, we're in Vegas.

I wanna go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas...

...dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel
and watch it go everywhere.

- What if we don't wanna vomit?
- Oh, you will.

That's why they give you the bucket.

- Uh-oh. It's my boss.
- What?

- They moved my field ride up to Monday.
- What does that mean?

It means instead of having a week to study,
I only have two days.

- That sucks.
- Can you start in the morning?

It's kind of a lot. Let me do a little tonight
and I'll catch up with you later.

- You sure?
- Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

- So, uh, now that Penny's not coming... Okay.
- We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.

<i>[BACK TO THE FUTURE</i> THEME MUSIC
PLAYING OVER TV]

Okay, wait. Hold on. Pause.

Something doesn't make sense. Look.

In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac...

...and takes the time machine back to 1955
to give it to his younger self.

But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future...

...so the 2015 he returns to
would be a different 2015...

...not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

This is <i>Hot Tub Time Machine</i> all over again.

If future Biff goes back to 2015
right after he gives young Biff the almanac...

...he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday
that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

- Whoa. Is "placed" right?
- What do you mean?

Is "placed" the right tense
for something that would have happened...

...in the future of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

"Had will have placed"?

That's my boy.

Okay, so it wasn't until his 21st birthday...

...that Biff "had will have placed"
his first bet and made his millions.

That's when he altered the timeline.

Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it.

What?

Unlike <i>Hot Tub Time Machine,</i>
this couldn't be more simple.

When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,
the alternate future he creates...

...isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine to travel to 2015.

Therefore, in the new timeline,
Marty and Doc never brought the time ma...

Wait, is "brought" right?

Marty and Doc never
"had have had brought"?

I don't know, you did it to me.

Yeah. I'm going with it.

Marty and Doc never "had have had"
brought the time machine to 2015.

That means 2015 Biff...

...could also not "had have had"
brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff
gets the almanac...

...is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff
never gets the almanac.

And not just never gets.

Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

He's right.

Also, what kind of name is Biff?

Sounds like when you pop open a can
of Pillsbury dough.

Biff.

Oh, ho. That stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

- Guys.
- Do you know that the word "wiener"...

...comes from the German name
of the Austrian capital Vienna, or "Wien"?

Do you know if you look at Austria on a map
it actually looks like a wiener?

Guys, what are we doing?
We sent the girls away so we could focus.

I don't think it worked.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]

Maybe after this,
you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.

I think after this, I'll be dead.

Look at us.
Out while Penny's in the room studying.

I'm proud of her. This is a great opportunity.
It's nice to see her take it seriously.

It is. But enough about Penny,
let's talk about us.

We're looking good.

- We are. Heh.
- Better than good.

I mean, look at you. Your body's banging.

- Amy.
- Don't "Amy" me.

We're always talking about how hot Penny is.
Come on, scientist to scientist...

...how big are those Hadron Colliders?

- You're embarrassing me.
- Oh, don't be embarrassed.

I'll show you the divot in my spine.

- What?
- No, no, it's okay, I was born with it.

If you put a double-A battery in there,
it makes my leg kick.

All right.

Oh, this is already better.
There are far fewer distractions in here.

Plus this is where our minds
are conditioned to focus on work.

So I've been thinking about the hoverboards,
and maybe we could use maglev technology.

Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the
materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.

Oh, I wonder if anyone's tried that.

Go online and look it up.

I can't argue with him.
It's right there on the screen.

Austria does look like a wiener. Heh.

That's nothing, dude.
Go check out how hung Florida is.

I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.
Can we get back to work?

He's right.

Oh, here's a thought.

What if we use some form
of operant conditioning techniques...

...to keep us from getting off topic?

- Like behavior modification?
- Exactly.

Did you know those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons to play Ping-Pong?

That cannot be true.

[PING-PONG BALL BOUNCING,
PIGEONS COOING OVER SPEAKERS]

Hey, it was match point.

Some psychologists perform
operant conditioning with punishment.

Maybe we can come up with a punishment
for straying off topic.

Not getting to see who wins
at pigeon Ping-Pong comes to mind.

We could snap a rubber band on our wrists
every time we get sidetracked.

Not bad. You know, in medieval times...

...idle chatter was punished
with a device called the scold's bridle.

It's an iron cage that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

If only we had one.

Oh, I'll check Amazon.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

BERNADETTE:
Housekeeping.

AMY: We got a complaint about somebody
pooping on a party in there.

It was us the whole time.

- Why'd you tell her? It was working.
- Was it working?

Yeah.

Oh. I'm so sorry.

You guys look like you're having fun.

We're having the best time.

Guess who won $100 playing craps.

That's a dollar.

Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

Hey, Penny, let's go.

We found a place
that has Australian male strippers.

We wanna see if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

[ALL LAUGHING]

That sounds so great,
but I have a little more studying to do.

Ugh. Can you believe this nerd?

Do you wanna sit here being a loser...

...or do you wanna watch me climb
into an Australian man's G-string...

...like a baby kangaroo?

All right. Guys, look. I would love to go out,
but I've gotta get this done.

Okay? So have fun at the club.
And if you get in trouble, find a policeman.

And if he's taking off his pants,
he is not a real policeman.

Okay, okay.
This is obviously very important to her.

Let's just... We'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

Here. Here, I'm gonna quiz you.
I'm gonna quiz you.

I got your notes.

I got your notes. I got your notes.

If you want these,
they're gonna be at the strip club.

- Aren't you gonna chase her?
- To the walk-in closet? Sure.

Okay, so we agree.

Whenever someone takes us off topic
they get their arm hair yanked off.

I can't let that happen or the girl who does my
eyebrows will think I've been cheating on her.

All right, now,
one benefit of quantum coupling...

Question. Who decides
if someone's gone off topic?

I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also...

Ow!

- We didn't vote.
- We didn't have to. That was clearly a tangent.

Now, come on. Back to work.
If we're leaning towards quantum coupling...

Ow! Why?

You said quantum coupling. That made me
think of the show <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

That's a tangent and it's your fault.

That's ridiculous. I vote that is not a tangent.

Yeah, thank you.
And now I owe you one.

Ow!

That was your fault.

Hey!

Oh, hoo-hoo. That is a lot of hair.

Ow!

And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.

Everyone, stop. This was a stupid idea.

Negative reinforcement isn't working.

I think you mean "positive punishment."

Negative reinforcement
is the removal of a positive stimulus.

It's a common mistake.

"Negative reinforcement" is really wrong?

It's used incorrectly all the time.

Even Bill Murray makes that mistake
in the first scene of <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

No way. Not Bill Murray.

<i>I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.</i>

Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.

- Jump to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
- No.

Leonard's right.

We can't just jump ahead.
We have to watch the whole movie.

We keep procrastinating.

We saw <i>Back to the Future II,</i>
pigeons playing Ping-Pong...

...countries that looked like genitals...

...and one guy whose genitals
looked like Denmark.

Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

It's late. We've wasted hours.

Can we please find it in ourselves
to do any amount of work tonight?

But we didn't see them bust one ghost.

So you're saying we should stand here,
in my lab, on a Saturday night...

...and watch the rest of <i>Ghostbusters</i>
on a crappy laptop?

No.

MAN [SINGING ON TV]:
<i>When there's something strange</i>

<i>In the neighborhood</i>

<i>Who you gonna call?</i>

ALL [SINGING]:
<i>Ghostbusters</i>

MAN:
<i>When there's something weird...</i>

It really does hold up.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]

[CROWD HOLLERING]

See? Isn't this better than a hotel room?

Yep. Shake that thing.

Have you ever seen a body so fine?

We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class...

...but none of them moved like that.

PENNY:
Good morning.

You wanna go to the pool?

[BOTH GROAN]

Come on. You said it yourself.

Only nerds and losers stay in the room.

[BOTH GROAN]

Wow, it's bright out. Isn't it bright?

I should probably close these curtains.
Nah. Bye.

Would you please close the drapes?

Okay.

[THUD]

[English - US - SDH]

I like your suit.

Oh, thanks.
Got a couple new outfits for work.

How's it feel knowing your fiancÃ©'s job is to
go out and flirt with doctors looking like that...

...while you sit here,
you know, looking like this?

- She doesn't flirt with doctors.
- Yeah. It's all very professional.

- When you bend over I can see down your shirt.
- Okay, good.

Speaking of new careers,
how are things going with dark matter?

Oh. Yeah. I'd have to say it's the most
exciting time in the history of the field.

Oh. What's going on?

I started doing it.

You know the government funded the biggest
experiment yet to detect dark matter?

I read about that. They're sending research
teams down into abandoned salt mines.

Look. Sheldon, if we apply
to be one of those teams...

...we could be on the ground floor
of something big.

Not just for theoretical physics,
but for astrophysics.

Hang on.

- You guys are gonna work in a mine?
- Why not?

You had a panic attack
when we went through the car wash.

Perhaps the emotion you're referring to
was shock at you having something cleaned.

I think what Penny meant is the thought
of you two in a mine is funny.

It's like a cat riding a Roomba.

If they get scared, they'll have hats with lights
because down there, it's night-night all the time.

Maybe they can ride around
in one of those mine cars that go:

[MIMICS SQUEAKING]

That'll help them get away
when they see a g-g-ghost.

[LAUGHS]

- Are they making fun of us?
- Yup.

I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.

So one of my favorite video games of
all time is called "Shadow of the Colossus."

It was only for PlayStation 2...

...but then they came out with a new version
for PS3 with better graphics.

I finally got a chance to play it, and for some
reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one.

Or something about yoga.

I'm sorry. I was thinking about work.

Oh, I was just saying
there's this video game...

Yeah. That's when I started
thinking about work.

Uh, listen. I've got some good news.

- This is for you.
- Oh.

- What is this?
- You know how they gave me the company car?

Didn't make sense to have
two, so I sold the other one.

- The one I gave you?
- Yeah.

And there's your money back.
Now we're even.

How great is that?

Uh, yeah.

What?

Nothing.

Oh. I know the car was a thoughtful gesture.
I really appreciate it.

- But it doesn't make sense to have both.
- You're right.

What should I have done?
Taken a picture of us in the car...

...put it in a pink frame with puffy paint
around it that says, "Best fiancÃ© ever"?

Doesn't sound that bad.

Well, good, because that's what I did.

Oh, ha, ha.

Thank you. That is so sweet.

Ah, it's not that sweet. I paid for the frame
with your money and then got a massage.

You know what, you don't have to
give me this. You keep it.

- Why?
- The car was a gift.

Something you needed.
I was happy to help you.

And I really appreciate it,
but now I don't need it. So here you go.

This is silly. You don't need the car,
but you could buy something else...

...like a new purse to put all this money in.

Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.
I have a good job now.

I know, and I'm proud of you, but that doesn't
mean I can't do something nice. Like this.

I don't want this to be a fight.

- I don't either.
- Great. Thank you.

- Can you pass the salt, please?
- Sure.

In my mind, that broke the tension
with comedy and led to sex.

Hey, Sheldon. You busy?

I'm always busy.

This mind is capable
of advanced multi-tasking.

Currently, I'm attempting to solve
the Penrose conjecture.

I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech
for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture.

And I'm wondering
how mermaids have babies.

Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

Now I've got room for another thing.
What do you want?

So I did a little research on
what the conditions are like in the mines.

The guys might be right.
Sounds rough down there.

For starters, it's very humid
and about a hundred degrees.

Well, I'm from Texas, and you're from India.

We're no strangers
to the fragrant armpit. Next.

It's also a live mine so there'll be
dynamite explosions going off in the distance.

Yeah. I have a lactose-intolerant
roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.

Oh, you have to be down there
for 12 hours at a time.

We have to be somewhere.

No toilet, so we'll have to do our business
in a bucket.

So it's settled. We're not doing it.

Look. I get it, but...

...before we pass up
on an incredible opportunity...

...I was thinking about when Howard
was training to go into space...

- ...they put him in a simulated environment.
- Interesting.

You're suggesting that we recreate the
conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.

- Exactly.
- Very well.

- So where should we do it?
- Well, I'll just Google...

..."hot, dark and moist."
See what comes up.

- Uh, Sheldon...
- Look. There's all kinds of videos.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Hey, you got a sec?
- Hi. Sure.

- I was hoping we could talk about the money.
- Oh, sweetie. Just forget about it.

No. Hear me out.
I know things got weird last night.

Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my
dresser after sex would count as weird.

Well, I think I came up
with a pretty good solution.

Why don't we put the money
in a joint account?

It'll be our first money together.
We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon.

Yeah. That's great. I love that.

Of course you do.
I'm not just a genius in bed.

[IN HIGH PITCH VOICE]
"You sure are, baby."

You two wanna be alone?

I want you to know I get why
you don't want the money.

The new job. You're excited
about being financially independent.

I am nothing but proud of you.

Oh, thank you so much.
It feels so good to hear you say that.

I want you to know that I get this job
changes the balance in our relationship.

And I'm trying to be sensitive to that.

What?

Well, I just think that you're hung up on the
money because I'm less reliant on you now...

...and that's a little scary.

Hmm.

Maybe.

Or maybe I tried to do something nice...

...and maybe you had a problem with it
because of your control issues.

"Control issues."

Maybe.

Or maybe...

...now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress
who can't pay for her own dinner...

...that makes you a little insecure.

I can't believe you'd say that. You know
how insecure I am about my insecurities.

You know what, I'm sorry.
It's stupid to fight over money.

I'm sorry too. We're about to share
the rest of our lives together.

It's our money. Who cares who has it?

Ugh. You're right. Who cares?

Get that money out of my back pocket,
or I'll break your fingers.

Huh. I never knew there were
steam tunnels down here.

Most universities have them.

When I was an undergrad,
I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.

- Did you get in?
- No. They forgot I was there...

...but it really opened up my pores.

According to my research...

...the steam tunnels below this access point
should be the closest analog to the mines.

It'll be more accurate
than the steam room at the gym.

Plus there's almost no chance
we'll see any of our co-workers half-naked.

Or totally naked.

I love Howard,
but the dude needs a little shame.

Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours.

If we run into any problems, I'll contact you.

If anything bad happens, what's the rule?

Save you first,
come back for Raj only if there's time.

We're going to be fine.

[SHELDON EXHALES SHARPLY]

Sheldon, I'm really impressed
you're willing to try this.

Admittedly, this brushes up against
my well-known aversions to heat...

...small places, going below floor level,
dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes...

...and eliminating in Home Depot buckets.

That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling
that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.

RAJ:
I'm sweating already.

As the person beneath you,
allow me to say, "I know."

- How hot is it?
- Let's see.

Seven-hundred and four...?
No. Wait. it's on "clock."

Uh, the real answer isn't much better,
102 degrees.

That's what we wanted.
This is as hot as the mines will be.

True.

Sheldon's mine-simulation log. Entry one.

Koothrappali's restating of the obvious
is already getting on my nerves.

- Thanks again for having us.
- Of course.

What did you wanna talk about?

Now that we're engaged, we had questions
about how you handle money as a couple.

I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

I didn't think they were going to.

I just wanted to have a way to say no
without hurting Leonard's feelings.

Well, nailed it.

What did you wanna know?

Well, do you guys ever fight over money?

Sure. Sometimes.

It can be a little awkward since
I make so much more money than Howie.

You didn't have to say, "So much more."
Heh.

I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy,
I felt that I should.

I brought significant assets
into the relationship too.

Like what? Your incomplete set
of <i>Star Trek</i> collector plates?

For your information,
I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.

Without asking me?

There were only three minutes
left in the auction.

It was a mint-condition
"Scotty" from a smoke-free home.

- How much, Howie?
- Not a lot.

How much?

Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

Was it more or less than falconry school?

For the 10th time, that was a Groupon.

Like I would swing with him.

How you feeling?

Good.

A little claustrophobic.

Let's set up the equipment.
It'll help take your mind off of it.

Miners often sing mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

- Do you know any mining songs?
- Just the hits.

[SINGING] <i>Where it's dark as a dungeon</i>
<i>And as damp as the dew</i>

That's pretty.

<i>Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few</i>

<i>Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines</i>

<i>Yes, it's dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines</i>

It's a little more bleak than I thought.

<i>Well, I pray when I'm dead
And the ages shall roll</i>

<i>That my body will blacken
And turn into coal</i>

We're getting kind of grim.

<i>Then I'll look from the door
Of my heavenly home</i>

<i>And pity the miner
That mines my poor bones</i>

Okay. How about a little Miley Cyrus next?

Who's he?

Talk about wasted money,
what about the late fees on our credit card...

- ...because somebody didn't pay on time?
- I would've paid it...

...if I wasn't doing everything else
around here.

You're saying
I don't do anything around here?

Look at my chore chart.

- She made him a chore...
- I see it.

"Do the dishes."
There's a star right there.

That was a pity star.
Putting water in the roasting pan...

...and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

That pan had to soak, and you know it.

Don't come crying to me
when you don't get your allowance.

It's not an allowance. It's a stipend.

And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance in front of my friends.

[DOOR SLAMS]

I usually don't like lemon bars,
but these are really good.

So as Hannah Montana...

...Miley was a world-famous pop star.

She would take off her wig
and go to school like a normal girl.

Which, I don't have to tell you,
at that age, is its own headache.

That's preposterous. How would she go
unrecognized just by wearing a wig?

But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity with glasses?

He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses.

He combs back his curlicue
and affects a mild-mannered personality.

AMY:
You guys doing okay down there?

I told you to use the walkie-talkie.

AMY [OVER RADIO]:
<i>You guys doing okay down there?</i>

Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

I'm going to the vending machine.
Do you want anything?

This is a simulation. We have to survive
on the supplies we brought.

<i>Okay. Just checking.</i>

We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

You're not going to have Funyuns
when we're a mile below the Earth.

What if we brought them down with us?

We'll take some Funyuns.

<i>Anything else?</i>

Some York Peppermint Patties,
a couple of Dr. Peppers...

...and run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player...

...and season one of a show
called <i>Hannah Montana.</i>

Have her get season two.
Season one it was still finding itself.

Sorry you guys had to see that.

- Don't apologize.
- It makes it harder...

...to pretend it never happened.

Money's a sensitive subject for Howie
because of the difference in our income.

It really bothers him?

Sure. There's still a lot of pressure
on guys to be providers.

So even though he's happy for me,
it's just a little tough on him.

Uh-oh.

- What?
- Well...

...if I do well in sales, I could end up
making more than you.

Not a problem. I grew up with a mother...

...who emasculated my father financially
and in every other aspect of his life.

Really, it's what I think love looks like.

I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

Maybe it's a good thing we came here.
It's like a lesson in what not to do.

I don't want money to come between us.

It won't. Let's promise to figure
this stuff out before we get married.

HOWARD: Why are you being so bossy?
BERNADETTE: Why are you being a baby?

HOWARD: I'm not a baby. I'm a grown man,
and I made the bed. Now where's my star?

- Should we go?
- Hang on. I wanna see if he gets the star.

This heat is brutal.

As someone from the
tropical subcontinent of India...

...you should know fanning yourself in a humid
environment raises your body temperature.

Huh. That does explain why the servants used
to look so hot while they were fanning me.

Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

My major focus at the moment
is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.

- How's that going?
- You tell me.

I feel like I can't breathe,
and I am tempted to crack you open...

...and suck the air right out of your lungs.

Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.

- We're not stopping.
- You don't have to bite my head off.

I apologize. I just...

I'm plagued by an internal struggle.

If you would just use the bucket,
you'd be so much more comfortable.

My struggle is emotional.

- Is it Amy?
- It's dark matter.

When I entered the field of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

I rose to a position of respect...

...and I assumed my career would
continue on that upward trajectory.

Now here I am in my 30s.

I'm back at square one.

And frankly, it's frightening.

Sheldon, you know what
I think of when I'm scared?

<i>Voyager.</i>

<i>Voyager the</i> space probe,
or <i>Voyager the Star Trek</i> TV show?

- The space probe.
- Good.

I am too hot and tired to go on about
how much I hate <i>Voyager the</i> TV show.

By the time I was born, <i>Voyager 1's</i>
mission was supposed to be over.

It had seen Jupiter
and Saturn and all their moons...

...but it kept going.

When I left India for America,
I was never more scared in my life.

I had no idea what lay ahead.

Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how <i>Voyager</i> is...

...still out there.

Somewhere beyond our solar system.

Going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

Don't leave. You can do this.

Sheldon, is everything okay?

It's too late for Koothrappali. Let's go.

Eleven minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

RAJ: They're in my shirt.
They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt!

Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing
we can do with the money.

I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

"Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time too."

I'm so sorry I made you
feel bad about the money stuff.

- It's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

I want us to be partners. Equals.

Adults in a mature relationship.

I want that too.

Now, let's talk about your birthday party.

Ooh, Laser tag. Laser tag.

- Do you really need me to transcribe this?
- You're not doing it for me.

You're doing it for future generations
who will benefit from my struggle.

SHELDON [ON RECORDING]:
<i>Sheldon's mine simulation log.</i>

<i>Entry four.</i>

<i>My Kit Kat has melted.</i>

<i>All is lost.</i>

You call yourself a friend?

I was trying to help you,
and at the first sign of trouble...

...you ran away,
leaving me to fend off a family of rats.

You're a completely selfish human being
and a physical and moral coward.

His statements of the obvious
continue to annoy.

[English - US - SDH]

- What are you working on these days?
- I'm studying one-celled organisms...

...to find the neurochemicals
that lead to the feeling of shame.

What do one-celled organisms have
to be embarrassed about?

Same as all of us,
getting out of a car without underwear.

Speaking of underwear,
I have some interesting news.

If it's sometimes Howie wears yours,
Leonard already told us.

He was being funny.

I'm pretty sure.

Anyway, I was asked
to be a part of a magazine article...

...about the 50 sexiest female scientists
in California. Isn't that cool?

I think it's awful.

Why would you say that?

Bernadette is a successful microbiologist.

She should be celebrated
for her achievements, not her looks.

- What kind of message does that send?
- The message is:

"Check out the rack on that scientist."

Why can't someone be thought of
as both smart and pretty?

I don't think a professional woman
should have to flaunt her sexuality...

...in order to get ahead.
PENNY: Okay.

What's the big deal? If it helps me make a sale,
I don't think it hurts to flirt.

Laugh at their joke, touch their arm...

...maybe crank up the a.c.
in the car beforehand...

...you know, to wake up the girls.

Maybe it's different in the world of sales...

...but it's already hard enough
for women to be taken seriously in science.

I was kind of excited about the article,
but now you're making me feel bad.

I think you should do
whatever you want.

Maybe if fashion magazines
had female scientists in them...

...I would've become a theoretical physicist.

Stop smirking at each other.

- Thank you.
- Oh, no. Thank you.

Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers
of our nation's commerce.

It's because of people like you
people like me can limit our human contact.

I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know...

I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor.

Although I do often deliver
alarming biopsy results to my patients.

That's humorous.

All right.

Yeah, I bet you leave your patients
in stitches.

That was also humorous.

DOCTOR:
All right.

Are you bringing flowers to a patient...

...to cushion the blow
of a terminal diagnosis?

[LAUGHS]

That wasn't a joke.

All right.

These are actually for a nice woman
who makes sales calls to my office.

SHELDON:
Hmm.

You know, they have delivery people
that will do that for you.

Yeah, I was hoping to impress her
by tracking her down on the Internet...

...and then showing up unannounced
at her door.

Making the extra effort. Good for you.

Great timing. Food just got here.

- Oh, Siam Palace?
- Yes.

- Mee krob and chicken satay?
- Yes.

- Extra peanut sauce?
- No, but you can have mine.

Ah, uh, very well.

Oh, and on the topic
of sharing things that are yours...

...there is a gentleman caller
bringing flowers to your fiancÃ©e as we speak.

What?

Why didn't you say that first?

Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?

We can both play this game.

Can I help you?

Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?

May I ask why?

Well, uh, I met her at my office.
She winked at me, and, uh...

...I... I came hoping
to initiate a romantic relationship.

Um...

Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.

Oh, she did, heh.

Seductively, like this:

And then she touched my arm
for two Mississippis. Like, you know...

- ...one Mississippi, two Mississippi...
- I got it, I got it.

Listen, uh, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

See, Penny is my fiancÃ©e.

Really?

I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.

BOTH:
Really?

So am I to presume that her flirtation
was just a sales technique?

I think so.

When will I learn?

It's just like the cute girl
at the pet store all over again.

Excuse me?

Oh, uh, she touched my arm
for five Mississippis...

...and I bought a $2000 iguana habitat.

Which she was always too busy
to come over and see.

You give these to Penny.

You're a lucky man.

Thank you. Sorry.

Oh, um. you probably
don't want her to see this.

It's unnecessarily graphic.

Hold on, doctor.
Leonard, where are your social skills?

This man is clearly upset.

We should invite him in for a hot beverage.

He tried to score with Penny.

So have these two,
and they're having dinner with us.

So how was work today?

It was fine. But you'll be happy to know
they pulled the sexy-scientist article.

What happened?

I don't know. They just canceled
the photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.

I'm really sorry...

...but I think it's for the best.

You want people focusing
on your achievements...

...not staring at your breasts
in some magazine.

I guess. It's really not that important.

Hey. Up here.

Sorry, we were just...
We were talking about them.

So...

I wasn't gonna say anything...

...but since you seem to be okay with the article
being canceled, I have a little confession.

I'm the reason it was pulled.

What? How?

I sent the editors of the magazine
a pretty scathing e-mail.

Amy, what did you say?

I simply pointed out...

...that they'd never consider doing an article
ranking male scientists on their sexuality...

...let alone showing them
in various stages of undress.

Because no one wants to see
Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt...

...bent over the hood of a Porsche.

It doesn't make a difference,
because they agreed it was in bad taste...

...and now you agree, so, heh...

...Amy saves the day.

No, what happened was
you got jealous...

...so you took away a chance
for me to get publicity.

But it was bad publicity.

That's for me to decide, not you.

I disagree.

As a female scientist,
I think what you do affects all of us.

I think you don't like
people expressing their sexuality...

...because no one wants you
to express yours.

Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.
That was over the line.

You have a nice night.

Please don't go. Up until my vicious attack,
you were the one in the wrong.

Here you go, doctor.

- A Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
DOCTOR: Thank you.

Neat <i>Star Trek</i> mug.

I actually have one of the phasers
from the original TV show.

- Cool.
- How'd you get that?

Easy. Gene Roddenberry
needed a vasectomy.

Wait a minute. You've snipped
Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

Yes.

Wow, you really went
where no man has gone before.

I don't like to brag,
but, uh, you see, I'm kind of...

...the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.

ALL:
Wow.

You wanna see
James Cameron's kidney stone?

ALL:
Ooh!

He was so happy after he passed it,
he gave me a Terminator.

That is amazing.
How long have you been collecting?

Well, ever since I was a kid,
but, uh, I didn't really get serious...

...until William Shatner's
bladder infection.

What'd you get?
What'd you get?

Well, he said it was a tribble.

It could be a toupee,
but either way, it's pretty cool.

I would love to see your collection.

Anytime. I've got some cool stuff.

When I first started, I thought
it'd be a good way to meet women...

...but, well, you know, heh.

- We know.
- Preach.

Could I ask you a personal question?

- Sure.
- Um...

I mean, you're a guy like me...

...so how'd you get a girl like Penny?

Oh.

Well, you know, just being myself, really.

Oh, please! I'll tell you how he did it.

Implacable, relentless badgering.

In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant
staph infection...

...and she was a urethra
that could not shake him.

I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.

A gallant man would defend his fiancÃ©e
for being called a "urethra."

Can we please change the subject?

- Hi.
- Well, that didn't go your way.

Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

Um, well, actually, I came to see you.

Really? Why?

That's a good question.

Apparently, someone was being awfully flirty
while not wearing their engagement ring...

...causing someone to show up,
thinking the first someone was available.

Oh, God, don't make it so hard on her.
The first someone is the deceitful you.

The second someone
is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.

Oh, this is very embarrassing.

Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry,
I did not mean to lead you on.

You touched my arm for two Mississippis.

That's why you were mumbling
"Mississippi."

- Can we talk in private?
- Please, yes.

I'll be right back.

So, what other celebrity genitalia
have you handled?

So, what's the deal?
You take off your ring when you go to work?

What? No, no.
I just put it on the other hand...

...and turn it around.

Keep that hand in my pocket.

Why?

What do you mean "why?" I make
more sales if doctors think I'm single.

I did the same as a waitress.

The real question is,
what is he doing in your apartment?

He was upset, so Sheldon invited him in
for a hot beverage.

- You were okay with that?
- No, I got upset.

Sheldon made me a beverage too.

He just showed up at my door.
Don't you think that's a little weird?

A little, but he's basically harmless.

He's actually kind of a nice guy.

My company doesn't allow me
to socialize with doctors outside of work.

- You gotta get rid of him.
- Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

I can't do it. He's my best client.

All right, I'll get rid of him...

...but you owe me one.

We're going to Oliver's house to see
his collection. Wanna go with us?

Yeah, sure.

You owe me.

Oh, my God.

Leonard, I was wrong.

Heaven does exist.

And it's in the basement of a urologist's house
in Sherman Oaks.

Welcome to my fortress of solitude.

This is where I go to get away from...

...all my other solitude.

- Come on, it's a replica.
- Original.

I think I just cheated on my wife.

- The gun from <i>Hellboy?</i>
- Yep.

- How did you get it?
- Bought it at auction.

Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit
about Ron Perlman's testicles.

WOMAN:
Oliver, I'm going to play bingo.

Okay, Mother, have fun.

Still lives with his mom. Yikes, right?

[LAUGHS]

Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.

Wow, "Donkey Kong"!

This was my game when I was a kid.

Because it's the story of a blond girl tirelessly
pursued by a small, oddly shaped man?

No, because I liked it.

Well, now don't get defensive.

You're oddly shaped, but you got the girl.

So I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot
about his relationship with Penny.

Yes. If you'd like to join in,
the premise is...

...their love seems unlikely
and doomed to failure.

So you think she'll be single soon?

Oh, if you want to get in on the pool,
you're too late.

All the squares have been purchased.

Interesting. Excuse me,
I have to take care of something.

[ARCADE MACHINES BEEPING]

Leonard, as your friend,
I feel I should tell you something.

- What?
- I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.

LORVIS:
Ooh, could you hold the door?

- Nice flowers.
- Thank you. They're for a girl.

I'm being implacable and relentless.

AMY:
Isn't she lucky?

She keeps sending me mixed signals,
but I think we both want the same thing.

- What's that?
- Unconditional love.

- Guess that's all anybody wants.
- I guess so.

Well, I hope you get it.

LORVIS:
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

Next game, let's switch helmets.

No, I'd look silly in that helmet.

- I can't take these.
- Why not?

I mean, you want what I want.
We had two wonderful Mississippis.

But what about the other girl?

Oh, right. Uh...

I'll tell her we should just be friends.

Dr. Lorvis?

Penny, we should just be friends.

You happy?

Do you think he bites?

Stick your hand in there and find out.

You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo,
you will not fool me again.

I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is.
He's been gone a while.

Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.

Sad how some guys
can't cut the apron strings.

Okay, now you're messing with me.

Uh, guys? We're locked in here.

Oh, this day just keeps getting better!

So you just left them alone
playing games in your house?

Well, they seemed happy and...

...I thought that would give me time for
you and I to get to know each other better.

That was before we met.

We all have a past.

Doc, you gotta see what you're doing
is a little creepy.

You sound just like Sigourney Weaver
when I followed her into a restroom.

You can't just go chasing after every girl
who's nice to you.

That's not what Sheldon says, and he seems
to know his way around the ladies.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back?
Dr. Lorvis.

Yeah. You care to join us?

What? You locked them in your basement?

Well, they're not locked in,
the door just sticks.

Okay, so how do they unstick it?

They'd need the key.

Okay. Nope. That's it.

We are gonna go over there right now
and you are going to let them out.

- Three Mississippi, four Mississippi...
- Move it!

Oh, good, you're here.
Amy, I am so sorry.

That has to wait. This weirdo
locked the guys in his basement.

- What?
- She seems nice.

- Who's she...
- Just walk!

You can do this!

One ladder left!

- Oh, yeah!
- Yes! Next level.

- Leonard, you okay?
- I'm better than okay!

I'm having the game of my life!

Dr. Lorvis, isn't there something
you want to say?

Yes. I'm very sorry
for locking you in my home.

Yeah, that was uncool...

- Get the hammer! Get the hammer!
- Got it!

[ALL CHEERING]

Okay, Leonard, let's go.

Just hang on.

Well, while we wait, would you like to see
Tobey Maguire's prostate sonogram?

- Sure.
- Okay.

Oh, spoiler alert.
He was worried about nothing.

[ALL CHEERING]

[English - US - SDH]

Oh, hey. We ran into your mom
at Benihana last night.

Oh. Yeah. She loves that place.

Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

It's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.

I know you don't want to hear it,
but she was there with Stuart.

That's fine, I don't care.

Doesn't bug you when they go on dates?

They're not dating. They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

Then went back home
where they probably fell asleep...

...in the matching pajamas she got them
because they both just love penguins.

Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas
who aren't dating.

- Like who?
- Like you and your dog.

Don't rule out the dating.

- Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
- You think you've got problems.

The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified as a great ape.

How is this helpful?

All the non-human apes
are classified as great apes, except one.

That means taxonomists
created the entire category of lesser ape...

...just to single out the poor gibbon
as the weird kid on the playground.

Now, there's a hairy little fella
with a genuine beef.

But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

- It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.
- True.

Sorry, kid. You got it worse than a gibbon.

- Hi.
- Hey.

We brought snacks for movie night.

Great. I don't suppose
you also brought napkins...

...clean bowls,
utensils and a roll of toilet paper?

- Right here.
- Ah!

- You guys are the best.
- What's with the clothes?

With all the new stuff I bought for work,
I needed room in my closet.

I meant why are they folded. But whatever.

- Ooh. What's this?
- That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

Wow, you still have it?

I just assumed it was balled up
in the corner of a barn somewhere.

What kind of teenager did you think I was?

- Slutty.
- Easy.

The word is "popular."

- How was your prom? Did you go?
- No, but I was on cleanup crew.

- Aw. That's sad.
- No, it was okay.

The DJ let me dance one slow song
with my mop before he shut down.

Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,
I still hear "Lady in Red."

My prom was pretty terrible too.

I was excited about my date, but turned out
he only asked me because he liked my friend.

- He spent the whole night talking about her.
- We get it, you had a friend and a date.

Stop bragging.

- It doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyway.
- Easy for you to say.

- You went with the captain of the football team.
- Uh, no.

I just made out with him a little
while his date was puking. Heh.

My date would've had to clean that up.

I have an idea.
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

That would be so much fun. We could decorate
the roof and make the guys wear tuxedoes.

Get our hair done and slow dance.

Guys, trust me, as someone
who's been to seven proms...

...it is never as good as you want it to be.

You went to seven proms?

Yeah, let's see. Four "Under the Seas,"
two "Enchanted Evenings"...

...and one "Night to Remember"
that I cannot remember for the life of me.

- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Bernadette?

She and Amy are dress shopping
for their prom thing.

Oh, yeah. I got that Evite.

Ever since I saw <i>Pretty in Pink,</i>
I've wanted to go to an American prom.

But then I saw <i>Carrie</i>
and I did not wanna go to an American prom.

But then I saw <i>Never Been Kissed</i>
and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

This prom thing
has been a real roller coaster.

Bernie's really excited.

I mean, I could tell, because her voice got
so high the beagle next door started howling.

- Did you go to your prom?
- No. Heh.

I had a date with a proper education.

Instead of a tuxedo,
I dressed myself in good habits.

Instead of spiked punch,
I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

Instead of dancing in a gym,
I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms...

Okay, okay.

...of AP calculus.

How come you're not shopping?

Let me guess,
you think the whole idea is lame?

Who cares what I think. What do you think?

To be honest, it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom...

...with a woman as beautiful as you.

Ugh. Thanks a lot.

- What?
- Now I can't blow this off without being a bitch.

That sounds like a yes.

Ooh. Every single person RSVP'd yes.
This is so exciting.

[HIGH-PITCHED]
Isn't this exciting?

[DOG HOWLING]

Yep. Heh.

Look, even Stuart's bringing a date.
I wonder who it is.

You know exactly who it is.
He's gonna bring my mom.

Why did you even invite him?

Because he's our friend
and you two need to get along.

Why can't he take your mom?
You took her to your prom.

I didn't take her. She was a chaperone.

I saw a picture of you two dancing together.

What was I gonna do?
They were playing our song.

I can't take this anymore.

[PHONE RINGS]

- Hello?
HOWARD: <i>Stuart, we have to talk.</i>

This thing with you and my mom,
I hate it. It's making me crazy.

You and I were friends for years.

And now you're bringing my mother
to a party I'm going to?

<i>What the hell?</i>

I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.

Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What are you talking about? There's nothing
weird going on with me and your mother.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Stewie, your bath is getting cold!

I gotta go. Bye.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Penny. Penny. Penny.

Penny. Penny.

- You knocked more than usual.
- Next time I might be in a rush...

- ...it's good to have a few in the bank.
- Okay, what's up?

I'd like to discuss this party
that Amy and Bernadette are throwing.

Since you and I are reluctant to go...

...I think I've come up
with the perfect way for us to enjoy it.

- Great. How?
- We pretend we're aliens.

I'm not the best at reading facial cues...

...but I'm gonna say that you love it
and wanna hear more.

Now, in the beloved novel
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...</i>

...an alien named Ford Prefect
pretended to be human in order to blend in...

...so that he could write an entry about Earth
for <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>

Which is a travel book
within the actual book.

Which is also called
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>

Okay, just one question. What?

My point is, pretending to be an alien
is a valuable coping mechanism...

...I've used many times.

I did it the first time
I went to see you in a play.

You had no idea Commander Un-Frump
of Seti Alpha-3 was in the audience.

Oh, don't worry.
He gave you seven thumbs up.

Okay, here's a question.
As an alien pretending to be human...

...are you planning to engage
in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?

There are post-prom mating rituals?

Not always. Unless your date drives a van
with an air mattress. Then always.

Well, if it's part of the prom experience,
then I'm open to it.

You're kidding.

I may be an alien, but I have urges.

If Amy wants to copulate
by firing her eggs into space...

...well, then I will happily catch them with
the reproductive sac on my upper flermin.

I'm not the best at reading facial cues,
but I can see that you're a little turned on.

If you're not gonna learn how to do this,
they make some pretty good clip-ons.

Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.

Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate
tie it for him.

His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.

There, perfect.

Are you sure?
It's my first prom, I wanna do it correctly.

I thought you were gonna be an alien.

I was, but Penny didn't want to
and you didn't want to.

Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali
and Wolowitz didn't want to.

And even I knew it was weird
to hire somebody.

- Was that a flask?
- Yes.

I've decided to embrace all of the traditions
associated with prom...

...including spiking the punch.

You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?

Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.

It's all the fun of high school high jinks
with a cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.

If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket...

...you'd be the toughest kid
on the Disney Channel.

So anything else planned for tonight?

Oh, everything.

Getting our picture taken, slow dancing...

...being elected prom king.

Pointing out that kings aren't elected.

It's gonna be off the hook.

And while you're at it...

...I know that at this age,
your hormones are raging...

...but just because all your friends
are having sex doesn't mean you have to.

Why would you say that?

You know, because a lot of people
lose their virginity on prom night.

Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?

Just relax, it's a joke.
You don't have hormones.

- Wow, you look amazing.
- Thank you, so do you.

Sheldon, you look so handsome.

Thank you.

Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

That's gotta put some starch
in the upper flermin.

What's that?

It's a scaly genital organ
that grows between his shoulder blades.

Try not to touch it when you're dancing.

- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

I can't do this. For your information, the flermin
doesn't rub between my shoulder blades...

...it grows out of the belly button
on my neck.

He's right.
I was thinking of the lower flermin.

Oh, I'll text Stuart, let him know we're close.

That's a neat tattoo.

Oh, thanks, it's Sally
from <i>Nightmare Before Christmas.</i>

That movie's so cute.

You like her
because you both have red hair?

A little, but more that she's covered in scars
and can pull her own limbs off...

...and sew them back on.

I like Cinderella.

Did you know in the original book,
the sisters cut off their toes with knives...

...in order to fit in the glass slipper?

I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

- Here comes Stuart and his date.
- Oh, she's cute.

- Oh, my God.
- What?

- That's Jeanie.
- That's Jeanie?

- Who's Jeanie?
- Don't say it.

That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.

She's my second cousin. We were 15.
I just said, don't say it.

No, it's okay,
he told me that story a long time ago.

- Raj.
- It was our first date...

...there was an awkward silence,
what was I supposed to say?

[GASPS]

Oh, it's beautiful.

Heh. The girls really did a nice job.

I know I wasn't into this before, but I'm so glad
I get to take you to your first prom.

What makes you think
I didn't go to my prom? I went.

- Who'd you go with?
- I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.

- Aw.
- No, it's all right.

We ended up having a threesome
with her friend humiliation.

If I'd have been there and saw you,
I would've asked you to dance.

- No, you wouldn't have.
- You don't know that.

- It was before my growth spurt. Ha-ha.
- What? That already happened?

Very funny.

- Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.
- I would have asked you. In my head.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

On the way home.
While I was having a good cry.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

- Sheldon? Can I come in?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

Why not?

According to an online message board,
I may be having a panic attack.

SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms.

But to be fair,
the twins were a real handful that day.

You're making me worry. What's going on?

What's going on
is we're about to go to a prom...

...and there's a great deal of pressure
on couples like us...

...to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks
called "making whoopee."

What pressure?
All I said was you look handsome.

Can you please open the door?

It's not just that.

Leonard and Penny
also made comments about it.

And I'm not blind. Even I looked twice when
I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.

So I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys's.

She passed me the Manischewitz,
I took one look at this <i>punim...</i>

...and almost <i>plotzed</i> on the kugel.

Is this what I sound like
when I talk about India?

So my mother's okay with this?

Why would she have a problem
with me and Stuart?

Because they have a weird,
inappropriate relationship.

Weirder than what you and I did
in my dad's Corolla?

- This is so messed up.
- I know, I'm having the best time.

Why would you even come to this?
Didn't you know I'd be here?

It was a long time ago, Howard.

And you're only second cousins.
Who cares?

Wait, so you knew
and you brought her anyway?

So she's good enough for Howard...

- ...but not for me?
- Yeah.

Have weird relationships with your
own mother and cousin. This is his turf.

Yeah.

Well, I might not have asked you
to dance then, but I will ask you now.

- But there's no music.
- I don't care. We'll make our own music.

My God, who's the dork now?

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

Thank you for wearing your flats.

Thank you for wearing your heels.

Look at me, dancing with
the prettiest girl at the prom.

Wanna take a picture of us and send it
to your old friends in the Chess Club?

I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago.

This is nice.

- I kind of wish no one else was coming.
- I know. Me too.

But it will be fun to have a prom
without all the drama.

[MEN GRUNTING]

Howie, get off of him.

Not until he stops humping his way
up my family tree.

Sheldon, this is silly.
I'm not missing another prom.

I'm going upstairs now. Goodbye.

I really did think you looked pretty.

You did?

Yes.

So much so that I started to panic.

Well, you can relax.

Just because you think I look pretty doesn't
mean we have to spend the night together.

Were you hoping we would
because it's prom?

I'm always hoping.

But tonight I just wanted
to have a nice time with you.

And maybe dance with someone
who has arms.

- Thank you for understanding.
- Of course I understand.

Sheldon...

...there's something else I've been
wanting to say, but before I do, I just...

I want you to know
that you don't have to say it back.

I know you're not ready and I don't want you to
say it just because social convention dictates...

I love you too.

You said it.

There's no denying I have feelings for you
that can't be explained in any other way.

I briefly considered
that I had a brain parasite.

But that seems even more far-fetched.

The only conclusion was love.

[PANTING]

I know what's happening.

This is a panic attack.

SoccerMom09 says to lie down
with your feet elevated.

Okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Just because I love you doesn't mean
girls are allowed in my room.

RAJESH:
Okay. Here we go.

Say cheese.

Say cheese.

Say cousin.

Say...

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Hang on. Heh. Sorry.

Hey, Debbie.
Uh, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie.

Okay, but we're just friends. It's...

Yeah. I gotta go.

[English - US - SDH]

- This is an easy one. You love this guy.
- Me.

Come on.
He's an underappreciated genius...

Still think it's me.

It's not you. Now think.
There's a car named after him.

Of course there is.
The Mini Cooper, because it's me.

How about this?

He's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.

Oh, Tesla.

- Hi.
- Hey, how'd it go?

Not fun. The doctor shoved
a camera up into my sinuses.

Yeah, I watched. It was like
the scary boat tunnel in <i>Willy Wonka.</i>

- They figure out what's wrong?
- It's a deviated septum.

The surgery is simple.
He's gonna do it next week.

Why would you have surgery?

Because I can't breathe.

And I snore, I get sinus infections...

Back off, he's all mine.

You don't have a life-threatening condition.
Why would you take the risk of surgery?

Sheldon, it's a routine procedure.
I've heard you complain about his snoring.

Yes, for the first five or six years,
but I've gotten used to it.

It helps me sleep.

He's like my mucus-powered
white-noise machine.

Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery.
It's no big deal, end of story.

- Very well, I'm done talking about it.
- Thank you.

- I believe it was your turn in the game.
- Okay.

Let's see. Oh, this person is most famous...

...for never having gotten his nose
mutilated with elective surgery...

...and never living his life in the shadows...

...as a hideous disfigured freak.

I think you could give a better clue.

I don't. I'm not even sure
if that's a person or a typo.

[SNORING]

Okay, why?

I'm listening to you snore.

I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.

If it helps you sleep,
then why are you sitting here...

...staring at me like the albino boogeyman?

Really, Leonard, insults?

After I spent two hours in your closet
waiting for you to fall asleep?

- What's your problem?
- If the surgery is successful...

...the snoring is gone.

And if you die during surgery...

...the snoring is gone.

Sounds like either way
I finally get some rest.

I have to be honest with you, Leonard.
I'm truly worried.

Okay, I told you,
there's nothing to worry about.

I've been doing some research,
and I've learned that 1 in 700,000 people...

...die from general anesthesia.

Buddy, do you realize that also means
699,999 people don't die?

I suppose that's true.

You're such a glass half-full kind of guy.

I'm going to miss that.

Oh, so my parents' 40th anniversary
is coming up...

...and I can't think of a thing to get.

Damn. Can you imagine being married
to someone for 40 years?

Not anymore.

Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

What are some of the things they like?

They liked going to the Mumbai Symphony...

...but last year, my mom thought
they were phoning it in.

Then my dad said, based on their love life,
she should know about phoning it in.

- He said that?
- They weren't speaking...

...so he had a servant say it to her.

Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them.

I know how much you guys love
the coasters I made for you.

They're yours in the divorce.

Hey, what are you working on?

Remember when I said
if you went through with surgery...

...there was a 1 in 700,000 chance of dying?

[SIGHS]

- Yeah.
- Well, I've been crunching the numbers...

...and so far, I've gotten
your probability of death...

...all the way to a sphincter-tightening
1 in 300.

Great timing.
My "check sphincter" light just went on.

Leonard, what if you have
an allergic reaction...

- ...to the surgeon's latex gloves?
- I'm not allergic to latex.

Then why don't you wear the gloves
I bought to do the dishes?

For the same reason
I don't wear the apron or the hairnet.

Fine. What about epilepsy?

I don't have epilepsy either.

No, you don't, but the surgeon might. Hm?

And your carotid artery
is just one shaky scalpel away...

...from becoming the dancing fountain
at Disneyland.

Sheldon, do you realize
that driving is riskier than surgery?

I do. I have the drive
to the hospital right here.

That is, if you make it to the car
without falling down the stairs.

And don't expect me to carry you,
I do that enough in life.

Buddy, I get that you're worried about me,
and I appreciate that...

...but I'm not going to die.

You don't know that.

I do know that it won't be
from an asteroid strike.

You know who else said that?

Every cocky <i>T. Rex</i> currently swimming
around in the gas tank of your car.

If there was an asteroid strike,
wouldn't you die too?

I don't know. I'm smart and scrappy.
I think I'd find a way.

Tell you what, the surgery's not for a week.
I'll think about it.

Thank you.
And while you're thinking about it...

...if you have the surgery in Nicaragua
during monsoon season...

...I can guarantee your death.

Yes. Okay.

I understand.

Of course, yes. I'll call you tomorrow.

Bye.

So I found this fencing school in Burbank...

...that has a Jedi class.

If you're cool being the only adults there,
they said they are.

Dude, my parents just split up.

- What?
- Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

He moved out.

Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

If you're not up to it,
we don't have to go out.

- We can just hang here.
- No, it's fine.

It's not that big a deal.
As long as they're happy, I'm happy.

And when I get to see them
for the holidays...

...I get to celebrate Diwali twice,
one at each house.

That's double the Diwali.

- You sure you're okay?
- I'm okay.

- You don't look okay.
- How can I be okay?

I come from a broken home.

Doctor said I should be out of surgery by 10.

Okay. And Sheldon really believes
we're at a public swimming pool?

He was so busy figuring out
how many parts per million of urine...

...we'd be floating around in,
he didn't even question it.

Eighteen parts per million.

And he's still doing it.

Don't worry about it.
I'm happy to take you to work.

Well, thank you.

And Leonard never lets me
have French toast sticks in the car.

I can't have syrupy fingers...

...but he can do the backstroke
in a toilet bowl.

It's nice they're getting exercise.

Although, now that I think about it...

...Leonard would never go swimming
in public without his swim shirt.

- I'm sure he brought it.
- No, but last year at Magic Mountain...

...he got such a bad sunburn,
we had to cut him out of it.

He probably got a new one.
Finish your breakfast.

There's an entire section of my dashboard
that doesn't have any syrup on it.

You're acting odd. Why?

I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that.

Just last night I tried to see how many
fava beans I could fit in my mouth.

- Tell me the truth.
- Twenty-eight.

- Come on.
- Fifty-six.

Amy. What's going on?

All right.

Don't get upset...

...but an earlier appointment
opened up for Leonard...

...and he's getting the surgery right now.

I see.

Take me to Leonard.

- Just go to work. He'll be fine.
- Amy, he's my best friend.

And if you don't take me,
I'm going there anyway.

Fine.

- It's sweet that you care about him so much.
- I do.

I couldn't forgive myself
if something happened to him...

...and I wasn't at his bedside to say,
"I told you so."

[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA]

- Hello.
- We had a really nice swim.

Oh, stop it.

I assume this medical center's
treated the burns on your bottom...

...from the recent pants fire.

- Because I'm a liar, liar?
- That's for the fire marshal to determine.

- You had to tell him?
- He wore me down.

And I was distracted.
He has on extra baby powder today.

- Is he okay?
- He's still in surgery.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

- Very well.
- He's gonna be all right.

That is sticky.

Let's talk about something
other than the surgery.

That's a good idea.
Penny, did you and Leonard...

...ever discuss funeral arrangements?

I think she meant something a little happier.

I suppose we can try
to make it a celebration...

...but he died so young.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Knock, knock.
- Hi.

- Hey, what brings you guys by?
- Oh, muffin much.

Told you, not funny.

Well, he's just not laughing
because he's feeling blueberry.

Tough crowd.

- I'm sorry. This is very sweet, thanks.
- So how you doing?

Better. I guess the news just hit me
a lot harder than I expected.

Well, of course. I would be devastated
if my parents split up.

Why? Your father barely speaks
to your mother. Heh.

Well, at least he stuck around.
Not like your dad, who just took off.

As you can see, we're here to cheer you up.

Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense
of what happened with your folks?

I think over time,
they started to resent each other.

Instead of talking about things,
they kept it bottled up...

...and the hate just grew.

It's a shame they spent
all that time unhappy...

...but sometimes,
there's muffin you can do about it.

You get it, right?

Well, it's nice you got him that.

Oh, this isn't for Leonard. No.

Amy bought it for me.

He stubbed his toe on the revolving door
on the way in.

You know those confounded things
make me dizzy.

Who told you to keep going around?

There was a large plant in the lobby.
It kept looking like the outside.

When Leonard comes out,
he's not gonna feel great...

...so please don't give him a hard time.

Penny has a good point.

This is like the man in the supermarket
with the goiter on his neck.

Whatever you're thinking,
just keep it to yourself.

It was like a grapefruit.

And I'm sure he knew that...

...before you held a grapefruit up next to it.

Well, I'm not making any promises.

Not only did Leonard take
what I feel is an unnecessary risk...

- ...he deceived me.
- The reason he deceived you...

- ...is you were a pain in the ass.
- The reason I was being a pain in the B...

...is because I was worried
and no one else was.

- Really? You won't even say A?
- You bet your sweet B I won't.

Obviously I care about Leonard.
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.

And I'm not?

[RUMBLING]

- It's an earthquake. I knew it.
- Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.

A little tremor that turns
routine sinus surgery...

...into a frontal lobotomy.

Oh, I don't care for this at all.

I need to see he's okay.

- Sheldon, you can't go back there.
SHELDON: Try and stop me.

[THUDS]

AMY: Are you okay?
SHELDON: Why didn't you stop me?

Can I tell you something?

This whole thing with Raj's parents...

...just got me a little worried about us.

What are you talking about? We're fine.

And Raj's parents probably split up
because of Raj.

What?

They always say the children
aren't to blame, but...

Heh, come on.

I'm not joking, Howie.
You heard what he said about his parents.

It was the little things they kept bottled up.

I don't want that to happen to us.

How can I convince you it won't?

Well, is there anything about me
you're keeping inside?

Heh. I'm not answering that. It's a trap.

So there are things you don't like.

And here I am in the trap.

You just keep talking,
I'm gonna chew my leg off.

Just tell me one thing that bothers you
and I promise I won't get mad.

Okay. The truth is...

...sometimes you're too beautiful.

Howie, be serious.

Okay, okay.

I really don't like how your wings
poke me when we sleep...

...because you're an angel.

Okay, fine. Maybe it was a bad idea.

I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage
is to criticize each other.

Although, there are ways
to improve our communication.

One thing I learned
when I was in couples therapy was...

- Who were you in couples therapy with?
- Not important.

- Was it your mom?
- Not important.

It was your mom.

Anyway, the therapist
had us tell each other...

...what we loved about one another.

Oh, that's so sweet. I wanna do that.

Okay.

Okay. Um, I love that you make me laugh.

Thank you.

And I love that you're strong
and independent.

And yet, I still love
when you hold a door for me.

I love that I'm kind of a slob around here...

...and, heh-heh, you're okay with that.

Uh-huh.

And I love that I work and do all the cleaning
and you're okay with that.

See, I am. Isn't this great?

Come on, smile.
This is gonna be my Christmas card.

[IN NASALLY VOICE]
You know, this is all your fault.

[IN NASALLY VOICE]
How is it my fault?

I told you not to get the surgery.

Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success.

Secondly, I didn't want you there.

Wow. I don't know which hurts worse,
my nose or my heart.

I'm done speaking to you.

Don't be like that.
You two need to talk this out.

Yeah, because you sound really funny.

[PENNY LAUGHING]

I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the surgery...

...but you were worried about nothing.

Oh, you're hardly out of the woods.

You still run the risk of infection,
a blood clot...

...the possibility that an inattentive surgeon
let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose.

The minute you sneeze web,
I'm moving out.

I never thought I'd say these words,
but come on, nose spider!

You were so panicked
Leonard was gonna die...

- ...you'll never leave him.
- Sheldon will move out eventually.

Yeah, once he figures out
how to work a door.

I was not panicked.
And I am not overly attached to Leonard.

You were so worried that you smashed
your face trying to check on me.

You love me.

Tell me those aren't the words
of a man with a spider eating his brain.

Amy, you're a neuroscientist.

Crack his skull open,
spray some Raid in there.

I love that you take pride in your looks.

Even when I have to pee...

...and you're in there
spending an hour on your hair.

I love that you're too good to pee
in the kitchen sink.

I love that you have
the confidence to speak...

...even without giving it
an ounce of thought.

I love how your hair
is always on the soap.

It's like washing myself with a hamster.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late.

I was on the phone with my mother.

- How is she?
- Pretty good.

She bought the book <i>Eat, Pray, Love...</i>

...and used it to set
my father's Mercedes on fire.

So, what's up with you guys?

We're just saying all the things
we love about each other.

Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.

- What'd you get?
- Oh, I ordered it before your surgery.

It's the urn I was going to put you in.

Okay, that's morbid. Send it back.

I can't send it back. I had it engraved.

"Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter.

He thought he was right,
but his roommate knew better."

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

That's funny.
Boy, I'm gonna miss these painkillers.

Hey, why did you get two?

- "I'm with stupid."
- Oh, that one's mine.

[English - US - SDH]

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
And welcome to:

"Sheldon Cooper Presents:
<i>Fun With Flags...</i>

...the Final Episode Flagtacular."

[SHELDON GASPS]

I knew it was coming, still scary.

Now, I'm sure you're thinking:

"The final episode? Who will stand
between us and flag ignorance?"

I know I was thinking that.

Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

But the truth is I can no longer balance
a full-time career...

...a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.

And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.

So as they say,
all good things must come to an end.

After only 232 episodes.

Two hundred thirty-three if we include the one
somebody forgot to press record on.

- You said you weren't gonna bring that up.
- And you said you pressed record.

Anyway, please, sit back, relax
and join us as we take our final lap...

...as indicated by the waving
of this racing flag.

Of course, white flags
can also represent surrender...

...the Stewards of Gondor,
and the Japanese Minamoto clan.

But I'm sure you remember
that from episode 62:

"White Flags:
Who's Waving Them and Why."

- That was a good one.
- That was so good.

You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office...

...was just going to be boring,
but then I found his dentures...

...and realized it's also gross.

Doesn't Professor Abbott's family
want any of this stuff?

- I don't think he had a family.
- That's rough.

I know. You can spend
your whole life working...

...and, at the end, all that's left
are some papers in a box.

Makes you think.

Oh, well.

Hey, we're supposed to look through
this before we throw it away...

- ...in case it's important.
- I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

I don't know, this old pen
kind of proves gravity.

When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.

My dad used to have a pen like that.
I dated it all through sixth grade.

It still feels weird
just throwing away his work like this.

Don't feel bad, some day
someone will be throwing out your work too.

That someone was Sheldon
and the day was yesterday.

Hey, look at this.

"Dear Roger, to be opened upon
your first great discovery. Love, Mom."

Wow, look at the date.

He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.

That's intense.

Poor Roger Abbott.

Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.

[CHUCKLING]

Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.

Oh, my God, Leonard,
I know he's dead, but try it, it's fun.

Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott...

- Ah, Penny. My rookie of the year.
PENNY: Hi.

Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me
and now he's a little hug machine.

Look at you. Brand-new
and already the third best sales rep.

- Come over to my table.
- I'll be right there.

Bernadette's just parking the car.

Oh, good. Heh. Bernadette.

Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.

Come on. She's not that bad.

Oh, yeah? At the company picnic,
she yelled at me and my grandson...

...for losing the three-legged race.

He still calls her "that mean kid
with the big boobies."

I know she can be a little intense, but I swear,
she is so sweet once you get past...

- Hey, what are you talking about?
- About how much we love working with you.

Isn't that right, Dan?

Over the years here at <i>Fun With Flags,</i> we've
had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...

And yes, even shed a tear or two.

Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July
spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.

How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

How about 4000? One for every domino
I set up to make that American flag.

Please enjoy these highlights.

[IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Crikey. What flag do we have today?

[IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Australia, mate.

And now it's time for the speed round
of "Flag or not a Flag."

Flag. Flag. Not a flag. Flag.
I'm crushing this.

Say, Betsy Ross,
what are you working on?

[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
I have no idea...

...because the story of me
sewing the first American flag...

...is unsupported poppycock.

Then who did sew it?

Don't ask me.

I'm just a simple seamstress
whose descendants...

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Are out to make a quick buck.

Fancy a dip, my dear?

I do.

Wait. That purple flag indicates that marine
pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.

No, this is.

Stop looking at my legs.

Not a flag. Flag. Flag. Not a flag. Flag.

[BUZZER]

Eh, crap.

When stuff like this gets me down,
you know what I like to do?

Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an 8-year-old girl?

Wrong, smarty-pants.

It's "Everything is Awesome"
from <i>The Lego Movie.</i>

Look at these notebooks.
They're full of pages and pages of data.

He clearly spent years on this.

It's just columns of random numbers.
Toss it.

But what if this was a potential breakthrough
for him?

What if this is the thing that would've let him
open that bottle of champagne?

Maybe he didn't know what to pair
champagne with.

Strawberries, caviar, oysters,
all good choices.

That look right there is why people eat
before they come to your parties.

This has to mean something.

There's no discernible pattern
that I can see...

...but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.

Maybe we can get some time
on the supercomputer.

Sure, we could try multiple regressions...

...with varying physical
and experimental constants.

We could run a pattern-matching algorithm
against unsolved physics problems.

Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

Or we could go talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.

Oh, let's do that.

You don't know how to do
cryptanalysis, do you?

Yeah, I'm not even sure if it's the right word.

So, Dan, you have a grandson.
How old is he?

- Seven.
BERNADETTE: Oh, yeah.

I remember him from the picnic.

He was the one crying like a wuss
the whole time.

I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid, heh.

Just builds character.

Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby
except their mommies and Democrats."

I need another drink.

What's his problem?

I don't know, maybe he didn't like the fact
you called his grandson a wuss.

Well, I didn't think you were supposed
to say "sissy" anymore.

Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are...

...but sometimes people think
you might come off a little harsh.

What? I'm like the sweetest person I know.

Look at me, I should be in a tree
baking cookies.

Yes, but once in a while,
people think you're a little mean.

Oh, yeah? You one of those people?

No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.

Action.

Welcome back.

Our guest today is a returning fan favorite.

He puts the reading in your rainbow,
the Geordi in your La Forge...

...and the Kunta in your Kinte:
Mr. LeVar Burton.

Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, remember our deal.

You do this,
I delete your contact information.

- While...?
- While you watch me do it.

Great, happy to be back.

Wait. Since you're here, I'd like
to get your opinion on something.

In honor of Black History Month,
I portrayed George Washington Carver...

...in a loving tribute that my roommate called
"wildly racist."

What do you think?

SHELDON [ON TABLET]:
<i>Hi, my name is George.</i>

Oh, hell, no.

You heard him, Leonard. No, it's not racist.

Are we sure this is the place?

The doorman said
this is the right building.

I think if you're pulling up your pants,
you're not a doorman.

SHARPE:
Who is it?

Uh, I'm looking for a Professor Sharpe.

SHARPE:
Hold on.

- Can I help you?
- Hi, we're from the university.

We're trying to get some information
about Professor Abbott.

We were cleaning out his office
and found these books full of numbers.

- Any chance you know what it is?
- He was always working on this.

I was thinking it might be
an interstellar coordinate system.

Maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.

I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

That could be the angle of perturbation
of a distant galaxy.

It's the number of calories in a yogurt.
That's his food diary.

- Really?
- Yeah. He wrote down everything he ever ate.

He was convinced that calorie restriction
was the key to living forever.

- Does it work?
- Seriously?

He could have been hit by a bus.
You don't know.

Sorry it's not more interesting.

On the bright side, you didn't have to listen
to his stomach growl for 35 years.

So was there anything Professor Abbott
worked on during his life...

...that came close to an accomplishment?

To be honest,
his research never amounted to anything.

You were his colleague.
How did yours turn out?

Great, this is the apartment you get
when you win a Nobel.

You could be very frugal. I'm getting
a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

I'm not a bully.
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong...

...but that's because my dad raised me
to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.

That's fine. There's a difference
between being tough...

...and telling your friend
her new pants look like a saggy diaper.

I did say that, didn't I?

Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious
I had to return them.

Where? To Babies "R" Us?

You're doing it again.

Sorry. Can we just go?
I feel like everybody hates me.

Come on, they don't hate you,
they're just a little intimidated.

All you need to do is show
everyone how sweet you are.

- I think I'd rather go.
- No. You're not going anywhere.

All right? I'm here for you
and we're gonna fix this together.

- Thank you.
- Even though your dress is ugly.

Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last
episode of <i>Fun with Flags</i> is at an end.

If I could, I would run each
and every one of you viewers up a flagpole...

...and salute you.

And if you touched the ground, burn you.

I'd like to take a moment to personally
thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler...

...who you may or may not know
is the first woman to co-host...

...a flag or banner related
Internet info-tainment show.

Take that, glass ceiling.

And if I may get serious for a moment...

...hosting this show has been
one crazy ride.

With all its ups and downs,
I wouldn't give it up for the world.

Except for now, when I'm giving it up.

Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white flag:

It's good for times like this.

Good night.

Cut.

Sheldon.

- That was beautiful.
- If you didn't press record...

I pressed it!

Well, that's it.
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

And we still don't know who framed him.

I still keep thinking about how an entire life
can seemingly amount to nothing.

I guess the sad truth is not everyone
will accomplish something great.

Some of us may just have to find meaning
in the little moments that make up life.

That's a nice way of looking at it.

Yeah, for you, not for me.
I went to space, so I'm covered.

You know what? This bottle was
meant to celebrate an achievement.

Let's make a pact. When one of us
gets their first big breakthrough...

...we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of
champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.

- I love that.
- Me too.

And of course, rubbing our success
in Sheldon's face.

- That's the best part, really.
- Yeah.

Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?

Sure, go ahead.

I just want you to know I didn't mean
to be rude about your grandson.

- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.

[LAUGHING]
What?

Why would she say that?
You know she drinks, right?

What?

No, she's right.

I just want you to know, from now on,
I'm gonna be much more sensitive.

I don't want anyone walking
on eggshells around me.

Well, okay. Then, uh, one thing
I've been meaning to tell you...

...is the company is gonna
stop paying for our coffee.

- No problem. When does that start?
- Five months ago.

- What? Who's been paying for my coffee?
- Yeah. All of us.

It comes from the swear jar
we put money in when you curse.

What else don't I know about?

- Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
- Yeah.

- That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
- You're kidding.

No, no. It's okay, it really only affected
Wheelchair Kathy...

...and she's back in the hospital now,
so it all worked out.

I feel so bad.

Then maybe you shouldn't have named her
Wheelchair Kathy.

Oh, my God, I thought everybody liked me,
but I'm just a monster.

But a cute one, like that eyeball guy
in <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>

No, I'm the worst. I'm a terrible person.

Come on, don't cry. It's okay.

It's not okay.
How can I even work here anymore?

- Because this company needs you.
- It's fine, we don't mind paying for the coffee.

I can't let you do that.

Maybe we could get you an
espresso machine for your office.

I guess that would be all right.

See? You don't have to be mean
to get what you want.

You're right. Now, where did we land
on my bathroom?

- Hey.
- Hello.

LEONARD:
How come you're up so late?

I posted the last episode
of <i>Fun with Flags</i> hours ago...

...and not a single person
cared enough to comment.

All that effort for nothing.

Hmm.

I know how you feel. I spent the day
throwing out a man's entire career...

...and all that's left is an old bottle
of champagne...

...and a naked lady pen Raj took
when he thought no one was looking.

It's not the same thing.
I don't think you know how I feel at all.

Sad?

Huh.

You do get me.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

Someone left a comment.

Yeah? What did they say?

"Too bad your show is done.
I kind of liked it."

Leonard, did you hear that?

The people are heartbroken.

I can't take this away from the world.
<i>Fun with Flags</i> is back.

- Congratulations.
- Let's celebrate.

[CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS]

Sheldon, that wasn't for you.

Oh, I'm not going to drink it,
I just wanted to hear the pop.

You know, I knew it was coming, still scary.

LeVar Burton.

[SIGHS]

What are you doing here?

You told me not to call and I didn't know
how else to give you the good news.

<i>Fun with Flags</i> is back
and you can be in the next episode.

Wil Wheaton said get a gate.
I don't know why I didn't get a gate.

At least listen to the premise.

Since you were born in Germany, I thought
we could talk about German flags.

How do you feel about dressing up
like a swastika?

[English - US - SDH]

Hey, how are things going
with your parents?

Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.

Yeah, speaking of attorneys...

...if I ever needed a lawyer,
I would not hire She-Hulk.

You know what? That was almost on topic.
I'm gonna say, "Good job, Sheldon."

- Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?
- Yup. She works at a law firm in New York.

Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm.

Between you, me and the wall,
I think she's an affirmative action hire.

Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town...

...so I won't be able
to do Christmas dinner this year.

If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner,
I'm happy to do it.

You can even bring your father.

That would be nice.

I've always wanted to do
a traditional Victorian Christmas.

Parlor games, goose and figgy pudding.

Ugh!

English pudding.

You get yourself all excited for pudding,
and here comes a cake with raisins in it.

I'm not going.

- You're going.
- Why do you hate me?

I don't hate you, I love you.

Well, you call it love,
but it has a lot of raisins in it.

Amy, good luck getting these guys excited
about a dinner with a theme.

I gave up when no one cared
about my Tom Hanksgiving.

I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.

- I agree.
- Me too.

You guys suck.

You know the best part of working
in the clean room? No allergies.

Check it out.

[INHALES]

Oh... That's a lot of oxygen.

We should get going to Amy's.

Can you believe there was a time
when we would've needed an array...

...of Cherenkov telescopes
to detect cosmic particles?

And here we are, building our own
multiware detector like a couple of badasses.

Yeah, I know. If we were still single,
we'd be tripping over all that booty.

Ladies do love a man
dressed like a kitchen garbage bag.

Oh, no.

- How did a pigeon get in?
- You shut the loading doors, right?

- I thought you did.
- Do you know what a disaster this is?

Because this room isn't supposed to have dust
in it and we just let in a flying crap machine?

What do we do? Should we call someone?

And tell them we compromised
all the equipment?

Let's just get it out of here
before anyone knows.

Okay, how do we catch it?

Well, what if we turn off all the lights
except for one, and it'll come to it.

It's not a moth.

Don't yell. You're not gonna get good ideas
out of me if you're yelling.

Okay, okay, so if I remain calm,
I'll get more gems like, "Turn off the lights"?

Great, we're turning on each other.
That's just what the bird wants us to do.

So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?

- Twenty hours.
- Oh! That's rough.

Not at all.

Did you know when you fly transcontinental
without your wife...

...you don't pray for the plane to crash.

- Can we please talk about anything else?
- Forgive me.

- How are you and Leonard?
- Oh, great, everything's good.

- I see you got engaged.
- Yes, we did.

- Let me tell you a story...
- Dad.

Sorry. I'm sure you won't grow
to hate each other.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Hey, Leonard, what's up?

What?

How did that happen?

Yeah, okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.

Sorry. I have to run to the university.

- What's going on?
- There's been a problem with an experiment?

A bird got into the clean room?

- You want me to come?
- Uh, no, you had a long flight.

You stay here and relax.

Relax? Easy for you to say.

Your mother isn't cleaning out
your bank account.

Forty years,
the woman never cleaned a thing.

- You're just gonna leave him here?
- Relax, he says.

Yup. Bye.

[SINGING ALONG WITH RADIO]
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

<i>Right down Santa Claus Lane</i>

<i>Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins</i>

I appreciate the ride...

<i>Bells are ringing
Children singing</i>

<i>All is merry and bright</i>

<i>So hang your stockings
And say your prayers because...</i>

[RADIO CLICKS OFF]

Why'd you turn it off?

Because in the last 10 minutes,
Santa came to town, kissed mommy...

...and ran grandma over with a reindeer.

I had a drunk uncle who did all those things.
Nobody sings songs about him.

Maybe you'd like him
if you thought of Santa as a superhero...

...and his power is bringing joy to children.

My uncle was accused of that too.

It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.

Okay, new subject.

Let's talk about presents.

What did you get Amy?

Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

Come on, Sheldon,
you have to get her something.

But why should I?

She knows that I don't like Christmas and yet,
every year, she forces me to celebrate it.

Not only am I going to this foolish dinner
against my will...

...at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe
and she kissed me under it in public.

Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.

She's just excited about the holidays.

Yes, and she's not taking my feelings
into account at all.

Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.

How?

Hmm.

Well, it would have
to be something heinous.

Something that makes her as miserable
as she's making me.

Oh, I've got it.

Oh. This is good.

- What?
- I'm going to buy her a present.

Yeah, you're gonna have
to walk me through that.

With gift giving,
there's an implied social contract.

If I show up tonight with a present and she
doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.

Then you're both sad.

Yes.

And maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never
make me celebrate the holidays again.

So your evil plot here
is to buy your girlfriend a present?

That's right.

Stay on my good side
or I'll get you a little something too.

[COOING]

HOWARD:
Okay, here's the plan.

I'm gonna put the food in the bag...

...and when he lands in the bag to eat it,
we close it up.

A Slim Jim?

It's all I could find. It will work.

Sure, if the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.

Okay, well, what's your plan?

I told you my plan.
Call building services and get help.

And admit
that we contaminated the clean room?

No, admit that you contaminated
the clean room.

Why do you keep assuming it was me?

Because you do this kind of thing all the time,
and then you try to cover it up.

- Like when?
- Ah!

What about when you flipped
the Mars rover?

Or lost Koothrappali's dog,
or almost drove off with that baby?

Again, it looked like my car...

...and the baby didn't even cry
until his mother punched me with her keys.

Fine. Put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.

What if you said it
without sounding condescending?

I can try, but your plan has the words
"garbage bag" and "Slim Jim" in it.

Hey, what's going on?

Genius here wants to catch a bird
with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.

Should've put it in the bag first.

So if you don't mind me asking,
do you think you might start dating again?

It's much too soon for that.
Why, do you know someone?

No. But if things don't work out with me
and Leonard, I'll give you a call.

Wait, how much do you talk about <i>Star Trek?</i>

Okay. Let's get this Victorian party started.

I've done some research about some
traditional parlor games we can play.

Like what?

Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.

You take a ball of wool
and you put it right in the center of the table.

Then people sit on opposite sides of the table
and try to blow the wool off.

Sorry. She's taken too.

You know what your problem is?

You're jealous because you and I used to be
best friends until Koothrappali came along.

- You found somebody you could push around?
- Hey.

- Stay out of this.
- Okay.

You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj
because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.

- Look, actually...
- I said stay out of it.

No, no, no, Raj, go ahead.
Say what you were gonna say.

All I'm gonna say is you guys need
to stop this right now.

It's bad enough that my parents are fighting.

Now I have to hear the two of you?

And who cares who's smarter?
If it's Leonard or me or...

You know, it's Christmas.
Let's say, it's Howard.

- Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.
- No, you're the one who let him in.

How do you know it wasn't Leonard?

Come on.

What about that sweater?

No, it's not good enough.
It has to be perfect.

I think the nicest gifts I got from Howie
show how well he knows me.

Oh, well, let's see.
What do I know about Amy?

She loves medieval literature.

Chaucer is her favorite.

And her eyes sparkle
when she watches old French movies.

And I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers
to dance as if she's playing along.

Wow. You really do love her.

I do.

Now, let's find the kind of gift
that makes her feel small and worthless.

You won!

Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?

You know, my wife used to throw theme parties
like this all the time.

Oh. I guess that's where Raj gets it from.

He and his mother spent
a lot of time together when he was young.

I was always working.

Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor
who works a lot. Heh.

Him and his mom have a type.

You gotta laugh at that, right?

No? All right.

All right, let me see if I've got this straight.

A picture of you on my lap
is a way to punish your girlfriend...

...for making you celebrate Christmas?

Correct.

Santa thinks dating you
may be punishment enough.

There's an argument for that.

But I wanna make sure.

- Smile.
- Ho-ho-ho!

[PIGEON COOING]

Okay.

On three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher
and get him airborne.

Howard, you wave the blanket
and guide him towards the exit.

Raj, you open the curtain
so he can fly out.

Are you sure a dummy like me can handle
something as complicated as a blanket?

- Do you want the fire extinguisher?
- Yeah, I do.

- Great, here you go.
- Okay.

One, two, three.

You have to take the pin out.

You miss the blanket now, don't you?

On three. One, two, three.

What did you do?

It was an accident.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

- Relax, it wasn't your fault.
- Maybe it's just stunned.

Dude, it's not breathing.

Oh, no. I killed it.

Oh, not again.

What do you mean, not again?

When I was 10,
I was playing in my backyard and...

...I sat on a blue jay. Heh.

I mean, I tried to bring it back to life
with electricity, but it just poof...

...caught on fire.

And the worst part was it smelled delicious.

Guys, I found an article here
that says you can do CPR on birds.

- Great. Do it.
- I'm not doing it. You killed him. You do it.

- I'll do it.
- No. I need to do it.

This is on me.

Okay.

Mouth over beak
and light chest compressions.

Don't blow too hard.
If you pop him, I will vomit.

Anything?

I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

Wait. Wait, his wing moved.

He blinked his eyes. He's alive.

It's a Christmas miracle.

I might argue a Hanukkah miracle,
but I'll take it.

Come on, little guy, let's get you outside.
Get the curtain.

Someone should really close
that loading door.

Well, that's that.

The room's compromised.

They'll have to change all the filters.

Probably shut it down for weeks.

You were right. Go ahead,
call building services, tell them it was my fault.

No, we're both to blame.
You know, let me take the heat on this one.

Just leave me out of it.

If they come and see crap everywhere,
they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Hey. I'm sorry. We're still here.
Is everything okay?

It's kind of boring.

Although it did get exciting for a minute
when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

- How much longer will you be?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

There's still a bird here.
We're gonna get in a ton of trouble.

Honey, it's Christmas Eve.
Who knows you're in there?

Our names are on the sign-in sheet.

So erase them and walk out.

- Well, I can't do that.
- Can't do what?

She says take our names
off the sign-in sheet and leave.

- We can't do that.
- Yeah.

ALL [SINGING]: <i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!</i>

Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.

If you like raisins.

Thank you. And it's figs.

Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.

Are you okay?
You hardly touched your goose.

It smelled too much like blue jay.

Can I help you clean up?

You Heimliched a ball of wool out of me.
You're good.

What do you say we exchange gifts?

- Sheldon, we didn't bring any.
- I thought you hate giving gifts.

Yeah, I do, which is why I got Amy this.

You got me something?

Oh, not just something, no.

It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed...

...and I swallowed the gift receipt
so you cannot return it.

Look at you on Santa's lap.

That's so sweet.

Of course it is.

It's a perfect gift.

How are you feeling right now?

Guilty? Sad?

Wishing you were Jewish?

No, I love it.

Oh, really?

Well, how about now?

<i>[CHRISTMAS CAROL PLAYING]</i>

SHELDON [RECORDING]:
<i>Happy Holidays to my dear Amy.</i>

<i>I hope you treasure this...</i>

<i>...as much as I treasure you.</i>

And you got me nothing.

Christmas is ruined.
Let's never speak of it again.

Oh, this was fun.

Actually, I did get you something.

But what about our agreement?

Well, you got me something. Here.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

Cookies?

They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies.

I called and got the recipe.

They're perfect.

It tastes like her hugs.

Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

I can't believe this.

You're happy, I'm happy.

Maybe a holiday that's about giving gifts...

Get your hand out of that box.

Okay. The next game
is called Hot Boiled Beans.

Yeah, of course it is.

One person is sent out of the room
while the others hide a small item.

Then they invite the first person back
by saying:

"Hot boiled beans and bacon for supper.
Hurry up before it gets cold."

If you people think this is better
than Tom Hanksgiving, you're all crazy.

[English - US - SDH]

What color would you like to be?

Oh. I'd like to be green.
But you know you always take it.

That's not true. Any color's fine with me.

I can be a combination of blue and yellow.

- Blue and yellow make green.
- Ah, then it's settled.

Hi. Ready to go?

Good news. We ordered lunch so we can all
stay here and play <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Risk.

Sheldon, we said that we would
play games with you tonight.

We'll still be playing it tonight.
This game can easily take 8 hours.

- Sweetie, you really thought I'd wanna do this?
- No.

- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

Did you say it out loud with words?

No.

I don't wanna spend the
day playing a board game.

You may change your mind when you hear
that this is the new expanded edition...

...which contains a
complete map of Middle-earth.

Now including the Haradwaith territories.

I will literally race you to the car.

No. Come on. Don't leave. Just try it.

We're always doing what you guys want.
It'd be nice if you did something we wanted.

You wanna be green?

They really have tried to like
a lot of the same stuff we're into.

Yeah. We do game nights.
Video game nights.

- We watch movies with director's commentary.
- Oh, my favorite.

George Lucas can talk through <i>Star Wars.</i>
I say one word. I'm banished to the kitchen.

Today, Amy and I are
deciding what we're all gonna do.

You got it. You girls are in charge.

- Thank you.
- Sheldon?

Fine.

Now that we're not playing,
you can be green.

- Thank you.
- Since you're green this time, I can be next time.

Let's see. What's something fun
the guys would never take us to do?

I know.
We could go horseback riding.

I actually can't.
My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees.

I rode a very thin pony once.
On the first bump... just popped right off.

All right, what do you wanna do?

There's a craft and
folk art museum on Wilshire.

Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

There's gotta be something fun
we can do that the guys will hate.

Hang on. Why do we have to hate it?

Three words. <i>Doctor Who</i> convention.

I did not force you to go to that.

You walked out of the house in a fez
and bowtie. I went so you didn't get beat up.

- I wasn't gonna get beat up.
- You were, but somehow, I held myself back.

You know what you could make us do?
Ice skating.

The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma.

And it plays right into my well-known fear
of getting flattened by a Zamboni.

Now you're helping them
find ways to make us miserable?

I'm sorry, Leonard. I'm a problem solver.
It's what I do.

I actually can't go ice skating.
I have unnaturally brittle ankles.

Is there any part
of your body that's normal?

[CHUCKLES]

- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Will you please relax?

- I can't take it, dude.
- You okay?

No, I'm not okay.
I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

Told you not to wax down there.

It's itchy when it grows back.

I'm worried about the
<i>New Horizons</i> space probe.

- What's he talking about?
- Nine years ago...

...he was part of a team that launched
a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.

It's finally close enough so
this morning, it turned itself on.

We hope. The signal has to
travel over 3 billion miles.

It's gonna be hours before
we know if it even survived.

We get to see him flip out.
He's worried it was demolished by space ice.

Space ice is no joke.

I can't even watch <i>Frozen</i> anymore.

Oh, the Philharmonic
is playing Beethoven downtown.

Before you say yes,
it's not the movie about the big dog.

How come we can't think
of something we both wanna do?

Because you always pick what we do
and I just go along with it?

LEONARD:
Ah. Interesting.

We're being accused of making you do things
you don't like and you are doing the same thing.

You should point out the hypocrisy of that.

That's what I was doing.

Oh, that wasn't clear.

Try it again, but this time, drive it home with,
"How do you like them apples, missy?"

All right. Keep thinking.

You're making it too complicated.

Why not stick to the basics?

Go shopping for clothes while Leonard
and I sit in those chairs and hold your purses.

I know I'd hate that. Leonard?

Well, yeah.

Now then. It's settled.

What do you say?
Sounds kind of perfect.

It does. Somehow he managed
to take all the fun out of it.

Well, once again, it's what I do.

Ugh. Another two hours to go.
The wait is killing me.

I get it.

When I was in the <i>Soyuz</i> capsule returning from
the space station plummeting towards Earth...

Before you finish, is this a story
about patience and waiting...

...or just another reminder
that you went to space?

A story can do two things.

I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.

You work in pharmaceuticals.
Don't you have anything you can give him?

All I have is our new urine flow drug.

It won't help with his anxiety,
but it's so strong when he pees...

...he'll fly around like he's got a jetpack.

I can't stop thinking about it.

You know, worrying won't have
any effect on what happens.

- I know.
- Maybe you need to do something productive.

Okay.

If I make this shot in the trash can...

...the probe will have arrived
in perfect working order.

So in addition to being crazy, you're resting the
fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.

- Yes.
- The man who crashed his stationary bike.

I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was
too up tempo. I got light headed and I fell off.

Okay.

It all...

...comes down...

...to this.

You happy? Now you can relax.

What kind of scientist are you? Everyone
knows you gotta make two out of three.

This isn't so bad.

That's easy for you to say.
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section.

Boy, that's a lot of panties.

You guys comfy? This might take a while.

I don't understand why women insist on
making a big production out of buying clothes.

You're right. We should do what you do.

Have our mom send us pants
from the Walmart in Houston.

They have a man there who
understands my personal style.

Bye.

Uh, I've got some bad news.
There's no cell service in here.

Oh.

Well, that's all right.

There were ways to pass the time
before smartphones were invented.

Mm-hm. That's true.

I'll look them up.

Son of a biscuit.

- Sheldon, it's fine.
- No, it's not fine.

What kind of store in the
21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

I'm gonna call their corporate office...
Son of a biscuit.

Let's see.

My armies are going to attack
the Shire from Buckland.

And I roll...

...a five and a three.

Okay. And to defend, I roll...

...two sixes. I win.

Boy, double sixes again. If I didn't see it
with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it.

I wonder how long
we're gonna be stuck here.

I don't know. The girls do a lot for us.
It's the least we can do.

It's true. I suppose it's only
fair we make compromises.

Look at you being all mature.

I don't know why you're so surprised.

If there's one thing I know about after living with
you for so many years, it's how to compromise.

I'm sorry.

You make compromises for me?

All the time.

On Earth?

In our lives?

That we're living?

Well, yes.

Just yesterday, you had a big piece
of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch.

Did I say anything? No.

I compromised and kept my mouth shut.

Like you should have
because everyone was laughing at you.

That is not a compromise.

A compromise is me driving you everywhere
because you refuse to learn how.

- I learned how. Amy taught me.
- What? Why don't you do it?

Well, it's scary.

And sometimes I get
the pedals mixed up.

But more importantly, driving me to work
is one of the things that gives your life purpose.

I can't take that away from you,
so what do I do?

Oh, come on.
I'm practically feeding you the answer.

I compromise.

Hey, thanks for keeping me company.

I'm happy to. I think getting out
of the apartment will do you good.

- Where are we headed?
- If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.

Buddy, trust me.
You don't wanna convert to Judaism.

I mean, I know I make it look cool,
but it's not all briskets and dreidels.

I meant a Hindu temple.

Oh, okay.

It's not like
<i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,</i> right?

Some bald guy with horns
isn't gonna rip my heart out?

Dude, that movie is an imperialist fantasy...

...that makes the followers
of a beautiful and peaceful religion...

...look like bloodthirsty barbarians.

- You love that movie.
- Yeah, it's pretty great.

- I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
- Why?

Because I've known you for 10 years
and you've never gone to temple.

You never talked about believing in God.

And last Diwali, I watched you eat two pounds
of sacred cow at a Brazilian steakhouse.

Religion is a very personal thing.

I do go to temple. I just don't talk about it.

- Yeah, but you're a scientist.
- So?

As a scientist, you believe the way to
understand the universe is facts and evidence.

And now, you're counting on some
blue chick with 100 arms to help you?

That is so offensive. Does everything you know
about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?

No, there's also Apu from <i>The Simpsons.</i>

Well, lots of scientists believe in God.

Newton. Faraday. Pascal. All were believers.

Even Einstein was famous
for attacking quantum theory...

...on the grounds that God does not
play dice with the universe.

Of course he believed in God.
He slept with Marilyn Monroe.

- Actually, there's no proof of that.
- You believe in your religion. I'll believe in mine.

- How's it going in there?
- Eh.

Not really a great outfit for work.

Unless something opens up
in the hookers and whores division.

- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

Do I force you to do things
you don't want to?

- Yeah, but it's okay.
- How is that okay?

I promised myself if I ever got friends,
I'd do whatever they said.

Really, I'm lucky you
found me before a cult did.

Well, that was a long time ago.
You're a different woman now.

You're smart. You've got great friends.
You've got a boyfriend. You're pretty.

You have zero fashion sense.

Tonight, we're gonna do
whatever you want.

- Really?
- Absolutely. You name it. We're doing it.

Basket weaving at the craft museum.

Well, you named it.

Oh, here's another one.

I wish that the apple pancake mix
was on the top shelf...

...because it starts with an A.
But I don't put it there...

...because I don't want you breaking your legs
when you're supposed to be making breakfast.

Is it my turn to talk about
the compromises I make?

I wasn't done, but go ahead.

He said, compromising.

Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust
the temperature in my own home.

I'm not allowed to whistle.
I don't wear shoes that might squeak.

Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.

Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with
the woman I love because of you?

No other reason. Just you.

- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

The last time I brought it up, you had a
breakdown, got on a train, and ran away.

Well, given my history on subject,
it seems a little reckless to bring it up now.

You have no idea
how much you inconvenience...

...the lives of everyone around you.
It's exhausting.

You know what?

You think you're so tolerant,
but the truth is...

...you're mean to me a lot.

Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those
sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do.

I have excellent peripheral vision.

On a good day, I can see my ears.

Sheldon, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.

I'm sorry too. And if you want to live with
Penny then I think you should.

- You mean that?
- Yes. Just...

...put on your squeaky shoes
and eeh-eeh-eeh your way out of my life.

Come on. Don't get upset.

I'm not upset. I'm just...

...imagining a world
without my best friend in it.

- Sheldon.
- It's okay.

I'm not leaving your world.
I'm just talking about living across the hall.

I understand.

Either way, I want you to know that...

...I'm aware of how difficult
I can be so I just wanna say...

...thank you for putting up with me.

Buddy.

How are you guys getting...
Why are there tears?

Everything's fine. We just started
talking about living arrangements.

Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.

It's exactly what I told him.

Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject.
Leonard's not gonna move until you're ready.

Well, what if you did it gradually?

All right. Well, how about we start with
two nights a week, I live with Penny.

How about one night and...

...I let you whistle.

- Okay.
- When I'm not home.

You got it.

There we go. Compromising again.

We really are the best.

Here we go. My first Hindu temple.

You see behind the fountain,
that tower that looks like a pyramid?

It's called a shikhara. It symbolizes the
connection between the human and the divine.

Huh. I always thought it was mini-golf.

All right. Shall we?

Yeah. Just...

- Is there anything I should know before I go in?
- Like what?

Like am I dressed okay?

Really? So every other place you've been,
you thought this was fine?

I know you're under pressure
so I'm gonna let that pass.

Sorry. You're right. I'm so stressed.

But you know what? Whenever I walk into that
temple, I realize whatever happens, it's okay.

We're all part of an immense pattern
and though we can't understand it...

...we can be happy to know
it's working its will through us.

That's nice.

Whether you call it God,
or the universe, or the self...

...we're all interconnected
and that's just a beautiful...

Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car.

[HUFFS]

Seriously?
You were just gonna drive away?

Like my life isn't hard enough right now.

A space probe might be destroyed.
My parents are going through an awful divorce.

The guy who cuts my dog's hair
just gave her bangs.

Raj.

You saw. She looks like
Jim Carrey from <i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>

Raj, you just got a text.
The probe turned on. It's fine.

Oh, good.

Namaste, grandpa.

I thought this was gonna be boring,
but it's actually kind of fun.

Don't tell Amy that.
We'll be here every Sunday.

Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.

It's not a basket.
It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.

Very nice.

Yeah. Looks great.

I saw that.

Well, roomie.
It's only one night a week, but it's a start.

- I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.
- Yeah. I'm proud of him too.

Can you keep it down?
Some of us are trying to sleep out here.

[English - US - SDH]

Okay. We're headed out. See you.

Before you leave, could you help me
test these noise-cancelling headphones?

- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

Go ahead.

Hello? Can you hear me?

Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter
in the water pitcher in two years.

Bernadette's nickname for you is
the virgin piÃ±a colada.

Your George Lucas autograph
is really a "me" autograph.

Yeah. Once I was too lazy to walk across
the hall, so I used your toothbrush.

Ooh. One time when you were asleep,
Amy took off her...

And that's why
you're the best roommate ever.

Aww.

Well, now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

So, what do you need those for?

I've been struggling to come up with
a theory of dark matter...

...that doesn't make protons decay.

I'm hoping to finally tackle it
by optimizing my work environment.

See, I've got...
My tea is at the perfect sipping temperature.

I have fleece-lined boxer shorts
to keep my tushie toasty.

Oh, last but not least,
this inspirational cat poster...

...improved with the reassuring face
of physics renegade Richard Feynman.

Is that why you had to take him
to Office Depot last night?

I don't wanna talk about it.

- The place is all yours.
- Have fun.

Oh, I will. Nothing more fun
than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.

And you thought
it was soaping me up in the shower.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

Bye.

Okay.

Here we go.

Proton decay...

Proton decay...

Proton decay...

Proton decay...

Proton decay...

- Proton decay...
LEONARD: Hey, we're home.

[SCREAMS]

Any progress?

How could there be
with these constant interruptions?

I love him, but if he's broken
let's not get a new one.

- What are you doing? It's time to go.
- I'm not going to work today.

And would you like to know why?

You spent the night working on
dark matter without a breakthrough...

...and now you're worried you made a mistake
switching fields and you'll sulk all day?

Like a big old baby.

Call me if you need anything.

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

I've been cooped up in here too long.

Maybe I need some fresh air.

[BREATHING DEEPLY]

[PENNY GRUNTING AND MOANING]

Penny?

Penny?

Penny?

What?

You sounded in distress.

I worried something unpleasant
was happening to you.

Like a murder,
or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.

No, I'm just doing this awful workout.
I hate it.

Well, if you hate it, why are you doing it?

Although, I could ask the same question
about coitus with Leonard.

I don't know, I guess I like that I hate it.
It makes me work harder.

- And to clarify...
- The exercise, Sheldon.

- Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
- I'm not going.

Would you like to know why?

You're sad about not getting anything done,
so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?

Boy, I am not nearly as mysterious
as I think I am.

- I invented a game. Wanna play?
- Sure.

It's called "Emily or Cinnamon?"

I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say...

...and you guess if he was talking to
his girlfriend or his dog.

Go ahead, make fun.
You can't embarrass me.

I've got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who
loves me so much she drinks my bath water.

Okay. Who was he talking to,
Emily or Cinnamon?

"I want you to know
the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it."

[LAUGHS]

Yeah. I may not be liking
this game so much.

Cinnamon. Give me another one.

Okay. Emily or Cinnamon?

"Check it out. I got us matching sweaters."

We all got the Christmas card. Cinnamon.

You know, a man can care deeply
about a woman and a pet. It's not strange.

Ooh. Emily. I heard him say that to Emily.

Thought you were staying home.

You know, I was, but after talking to Penny
I realized something.

First, she's trying much harder to stay
attractive in this relationship than you are.

And second, the reason
I may not be progressing in my research is...

...I have created too pleasant
of an environment for myself.

What do you mean?

Well, according to a classic psychological
experiment by Yerkes and Dodson...

...in order to maximize performance,
one must create a state of productive anxiety.

So, I'd like to ask you all
to do something for me.

Keep me on my toes.

Just throw me off my game.

You know, essentially, go out of your way
to make my life miserable.

Hold on. What's in it for us?

- Well, I suppose...
- Okay. We'll do it.

Done.

Thirty-three seconds.
Okay. That'll be our baseline.

I won't tell you how to do your job...

...but when a mouse completes a maze,
it gets a food pellet.

It also gets its brain plucked out
with tweezers.

And its last meal was a food pellet?

You're a monster.

All right. Next, we'll introduce
an anxiety-inducing stimulus...

...measure your stress and see how
it affects your problem-solving.

Very well, and good luck.

I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

Ready? Begin.

[SQUEAKING]

[SQUEAKING CONTINUES]

Why did you pop it?

I'm sorry. I was aiming for your heart.

Look. I know you don't like it,
but that's the point.

I need to irritate you
to find your optimal anxiety zone.

And you said no to tickling, polka music
or watching me eat a banana.

Who eats them horizontally?

My mother said that's how good girls do it.

Oh. Perhaps this was a waste of time.

Sheldon, you're a remarkable scientist.

Just be patient. I'm sure you will find
the breakthrough you've been looking for.

- Thank you.
- And if you only do solid research...

...instead of making
a ground-breaking discovery...

...what does it matter?

Only do solid research?

I come to you for help, and you insult me?

- I thought the least you'd...
- Look. Your anxiety levels are right in the zone.

Really? Oh, that's fantastic.

Wait. They're dropping.
Why are they dropping?

- Because you're happy they're elevated.
- Oh, that is infuriating.

Oh, look.
They're going back up again. Terrific.

Oh, no. They're going back down.

All right, guys.
What game do you want to play?

Let's see. How about...

..."Emily or Cinnamon?"

[CHUCKLES]

You know what? It's weird
that you remember me saying all these things.

Maybe the truth is you're jealous
of all my relationships.

Oh, heh. Maybe I am.

Who wouldn't wanna be the girl,
or possibly dog, to hear the words:

"You're so lucky,
you have the shiniest hair."

That is a tough one.

I know he brushes both of them.

- Gentlemen.
- Yeah.

I have figured out the perfect way
for you to irritate me.

I'd like for you to be my
intellectual sparring partners.

From now on, when I make an assertion,
I need you to challenge it.

So, you just want us to disagree
with whatever you say?

Yes.

- And you think that's going to help.
- Yes.

- Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.
- Oh, no. It will.

See, by keeping my mind engaged,
I'll become more focused.

Howard's right. That'll never work.

Stop fighting me on the premise.
It's scientifically valid.

I'm going to advance propositions.
I just want you to challenge me.

I don't think that's what you want at all.

Of course it's what I want.
Why would I say it if it's not what I want?

Because it is what you want,
and it's not what you said.

I ask you for one simple thing,
and you can't even do it.

- Yes, we can.
- Then do it.

No.

You guys are the worst.

Thank you. I think that was helpful.

So whichever rep has the best sales
for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

That would be so romantic
for you and Leonard.

Yeah. Clearly, you haven't seen him on the
beach walking around with his metal detector.

If I were going to Hawaii, I'd spend
all my time at the Keck Observatory.

You know the telescopes there
have better resolution than the Hubble?

Really?

Wanna go to Hawaii?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Ladies?

Ladies?

- Ladies?
- Come in.

Ladies.

What's up?

As you may know, I've been experimenting
with elevated anxiety levels...

...and I thought, what better way to increase
my discomfort than to subject myself...

...to an evening of tasteless,
uncensored crotch talk.

What exactly do you think goes on here?

Well, conversations that you wouldn't be
comfortable having in front of the opposite sex.

You know, who has the best cervix?

Which sanitary napkin
is all the rage right now?

Men's buttocks and how you wanna pat
and squeeze them.

We were talking about Penny's job.

And how difficult it is to do when
she's bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.

Sheldon, we are just people.

We talk about the same things
you talk about.

You talk about if werewolves can swim?

Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if
the human could swim before he was bitten.

What do you think?

Let's just talk about our periods.

No, hold on. All canines
instinctively know how to swim.

Why wouldn't a werewolf
have the same abilities?

Well, they're not 100 percent wolf.
They're a werewolf.

That's only part wolf.
It's like comparing apples to oranges.

Thank you.

Although, technically it's apples that turn into
were-oranges when the moon is full.

This is fun.

We should do it sometime
when you aren't all PMS-ing. Bye.

[CACKLING, WHEEZING
AND ROARING OVER SPEAKERS]

What is going on?

Oh, I need to keep my anxiety
at the right level...

...so I'm using Darth Vader, The Joker
and Godzilla's roar to stay in that sweet spot.

I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix,
but turns out I love her.

Well, at least listen to it through headphones.
I'm trying to sleep. Good night.

Boy.

Taylor was right.
Haters gonna hate, hate, hate.

You've been working so much lately.

I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.

Of course.

- Sheldon?
- Yeah.

Maybe you wanna put the notebook away
and talk to me.

Oh, no. I can do both.

My brain is working at optimal capacity.

I can have a conversation with you...

...and solve the dark matter
proton-decay problem at the same time.

Fine. How was your day?

Oh, you said it.

Sheldon.

Sheldon, I'm worried about you.

You're not eating,
you haven't slept in days...

...and to be honest,
that cap is starting to smell.

I know.

It's replaced Godzilla
as my principle source of anxiety.

Okay. So it's one vote Emily,
one vote Cinnamon.

Penny, you're the tie breaker.

Say the quote again.

"It's just so perfect that we're both Libras."

Wow, this is hard.

- I'm gonna say Cinnamon.
- Yes.

Come on.

That was the last one, I promise.
We won't play anymore.

Thank you. Because if she ever found out,
it would hurt her feelings.

Emily's feelings?

Yes, Emily.

- Yay.
- Nice.

Whatever, where's Sheldon?

Date night.

Can't be much fun for Amy.

At work today,
he tried his first Red Bull?

- What happened?
- He chased a squirrel around for a while...

...and then threw up in my car.

Don't you think
you should make him stop all this?

I don't know.
He's not really hurting anybody.

You didn't have to scoop vomit
out of your glove compartment.

He is getting a lot of work done.

He had a pretty interesting take on
proton decay.

Wow, if he cracks that,
it's a game changer, guys.

It would completely redefine
our understanding of the physical universe.

Hm. It would.

Okay. Back to "Emily or Cinnamon?"

"How can such a little girl
eat such a big steak?"

Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.

That nagging tone is helping my anxiety.

If you could go 10 percent less shrill, that
would put the "Zip-A-Dee" in my "Do-Dah."

I'm sorry, but you know we agreed
not to bring work to date night.

There you go. Perfect.

Sheldon, stop it. I'm not kidding.
Take the cap off and put the notebook away.

But after months of struggling,
I'm finally making progress.

You don't need to drive yourself crazy
to be productive.

Yeah, well... Or do I? Hm?

Sir Isaac Newton wrote his <i>Principia</i>
while convinced he was an armadillo.

- That's not true.
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

I have been hallucinating lately.

Sheldon, this has to stop.

You need to get some sleep
and take care of yourself.

Amy, I've gotten more done
in the last few days...

...than since I made the switch to dark matter.
What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?

Your thoughts and ideas come from you,
not from your anxiety.

Perhaps, but I'm not taking the cap off.

It's one thing to make yourself miserable...

...but you're making everyone around you
miserable too.

Now I'm telling you for the last time,
take the cap off.

Oh, really?

What if I don't?

And before you answer that,
can I have my dessert?

And then she threw me out.

Me, her very own boyfriend.

When all I've done is try to help humanity...

...reach a more profound
understanding of the world we live in.

Yeah, well, women. What are you gonna do?

I knew you'd understand,
Armadillo Isaac Newton.

Okay.

Here we are.

Hey, what are you trying to pull?

The president of science isn't in here.

You lie down. He'll be here in a minute.

Okay.

I thought you were trying to trick me.

Now, you just get comfortable.

No. No, comfort is the enemy.

You know what's comfortable?

Slippers and blankets and panda bears.

[GASPS]

Imagine a panda bear
with Richard Feynman's face on it.

Warm up the car, Leonard. It's poster time.

- Maybe in the morning.
- Yeah. You get some sleep.

I don't wanna go to sleep.
You can't make me.

You're right. We can't.

Darn straight you can't.
Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep...

[SINGING]
<i>Soft kitty</i>

<i>Warm kitty</i>

<i>Little ball of fur</i>

That's not gonna work.

<i>Happy kitty
Sleepy kitty</i>

<i>- Purr, purr, purr
- Purr, purr</i>

You know, he can be a lot of trouble...

...but when I see him lying here,
asleep like this, I just think...

...how easy it would be
to hold a pillow over his face.

You look like you got some rest.

Oh, I'm feeling much better.

And I've been continuing to make progress
without artificially raising my anxiety levels.

I turned the heat on in my car, and some vomit
came out, so my levels? Right up there.

Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?

- Yeah, sure.
- Of course not.

So, I hear you guys
have been playing a little game.

Well, we were just kidding around.

You may think it's funny
that Raj is sweet and sensitive.

But I think it's sexy.

Ugh. Why is there dog hair in your mouth?

[English - US - SDH]

So tell me about your day.
How's it going with the particle detector?

Wow, you remember that?

Yeah, I listen to what you say.

You're building a particle detector
using superfluid helium.

You know, when you talk like that
I want to take you right here on this table.

You know from experience
this table cannot support both our weight.

So how's the detector going?

It's tricky working with superfluids.

Whatever container you put them in, they
creep up the sides and crawl out on their own.

Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

Exactly. Except you don't have
a lunatic running around yelling:

"I fed you sugar water.
Why are you biting me?"

Ha.

You really want to talk about this?

I do. I didn't write "superfluid helium"
on this napkin for nothing.

Okay, well, this is cool. There's a thing
called superfluid vacuum theory...

...where empty space is imagined
as a superfluid with all of its qualities:

Viscosity, density, surface tension...

If you're pausing for dramatic effect,
I'd keep it moving.

No, no.

[SIGHS]

People don't talk about surface tension.

If you imagine our three-space...

...as the surface of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...

This is exciting.

This is really exciting.
I have to go find Sheldon.

Okay, well, if you find him,
use the kitchen island.

That coffee table
will not support both of you.

Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid...

...shows the same
negative energy density as space-time.

What do you think? So, what do you think?

Hmmm.

What? Is it wrong?
Have you seen it somewhere else?

Hmmm.

I know this isn't my area,
and I could never do math like you can...

...but could this be something?

[SHELDON SIGHS]

Well, you could've set
Newton's gravitational constant to one.

And the whole thing reeks of blueberry.
You know I can't stand these scented markers.

No one told you to taste them.

Come on, is this good or not?

- It's good.
- Really?

I like it. I think you're onto something.

- You do? Not messing with me?
- Not at all.

In fact, I have got something
for just such an occasion.

I was starting to think I might never
get a chance to give it to you.

Good job.

You're giving me a sticker.

Not just a sticker.

It's a sticker of a kitty saying "mee-wow."

I'm not a preschooler.

- Fine, I'll take it back.
- I earned this. Back off.

You're still awake?

For a man whose last observation...

...was our universe may be the surface of
a multidimensional supercooled liquid...

..."you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

You worked out all the math.

Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

I wrote a paper.

You wrote a paper on my idea?

I wrote a paper on our idea.

When did my idea become our idea?

When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness...

...and cooked it
in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

This is good.

Our idea's really good.

Well, the light bulb in this oven
is ridiculously bright.

You know, if no one's thought of this yet,
this could be a big deal.

Only way we'll know for sure
is if we post it online to the pre-print server.

I have it ready to go,
but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

It's all happening so fast.

Should we sleep on it?

We could, but we always run the risk
of someone else beating us to the punch.

You're sure it's good?

My name is right on there with yours.

That is a surefire mark of quality.

That might as well say,
"Directed by Joss Whedon."

Okay, partner, let's do it.

Come on.

Click the mouse with me.

One, two, three...

- ...click.
- Click.

Uh, we did it.

Yes, we did, my friend.

- Is your tongue blue?
- I don't want to talk about it.

- Movie night. What do you wanna watch?
- What happened to that movie you were in?

Oh, God, probably nothing.

I think I saw the director
twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.

- Search for it.
- What...? No, why?

- Because it would be fun to watch.
- It would be humiliating.

Well, now we have two reasons.

They have it.

- Please, can we watch it?
- Please.

Fine. But I'm telling you, it's terrible.

- Have you even seen it?
- No.

Maybe it turned out better than you think.

MAN [OVER TV]:
<i>Bananas. Get your fresh bananas.</i>

Ho, ho, it really didn't.

Sheldon, this is superfluid helium.

Put this in your mouth,
your tongue will freeze and break off.

Does it smell like blueberries?

- No.
- Then we're probably okay.

Hey, your paper got mentioned
on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.

- Really? What did they say?
- It's basically a summary of the theory...

- ...but there's a bunch of positive comments.
- Let me see. Let me see.

One calls it "Insightful and innovative."

We're insightful and innovative.

- Ooh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
- Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative.

Another one says, "The concept shows
some real out-of-the-box thinking."

Do you hear that Mr. Out-Of-The?

I do indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.

How are you today,
Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jackasses?

Just dandy,
Mr. I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.

- Read another one.
- Okay, okay. Um...

"The analogy between space-time
and a supercooled fluid...

...is either meaningless or false.

I wish this blog
would devote itself to real science...

...instead of wasting our time with crackpot,
wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."

- Who wrote that?
- It's anonymous.

Username, "General Relativity."

Well, I'm responding to it.

Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.

Look, I am simply going to defend our work,
scientist to scientist.

And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys
a string of both human and non-human lovers.

Sheldon, my name's on that paper too.

There's no upside to doing this.

- He just left another comment.
- What does it say?

"Upon review, I've changed my mind
about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis...

...that space-time is like a superfluid.
In fact, it's inspired me...

...to come up with my own theory:

Maybe space-time is like two clowns
with their heads in a bucket...

...much like Cooper and Hofstadter."

Can I respond now?

Do it.

You mess with the bull, you get the horns.

I'm about to show this guy
just how horny I can be.

Somebody else do it.

PENNY [OVER TV]:
<i>Doctor, please help me.</i>

<i>I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.</i>

MAN [OVER TV]: <i>Why do you think</i>
<i>you're turning into a killer gorilla...</i>

<i>...and not just a regular gorilla?</i>

PENNY [OVER TV]:
<i>Because regular gorillas are vegetarians...</i>

<i>...and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.</i>

Okay, we've seen plenty.

- No, give me the remote.
- Careful, she'll bite your fingers off.

I've been poking around the Internet...

...and I found something
we'll enjoy watching even more.

- What is it?
- Just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.

- What?
- Okay, I learned my lesson.

Making fun of people is wrong.

I haven't learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.

<i>Hi, I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...</i>

<i>...from Yorba Linda, California.</i>

Ha! You look like a talking cupcake.

<i>And you should pick me for Miss California
Quiznos 1999, because I want to:</i>

<i>Tell you what I want
What I really, really want</i>

<i>I'll tell you what I want</i>

<i>What I really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna</i>

<i>Really, really, really be
Miss California Quiznos 1999</i>

Play it again. Play it again.

Did he respond yet?

No, not yet.

Hmm. Maybe we shouldn't
have sunk to his level.

It wasn't that bad.

Read it back one more time.

"My good sir, we are neither
crackpots nor wannabes.

In fact, we are experts in our fields.

And while you hide behind your anonymity,
we stand behind our paper.

And later tonight, your mother."

- And you don't think that's too rough?
- We're just standing behind her.

It's not like we're gonna say
"boo" and scare her.

How could you not tell us
you were in beauty pageants?

Because it's embarrassing.

Ha! It is. It truly is.

Yeah, well, Amy writes
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i> fan fiction...

...about herself and posts it on the Internet.

No.

Why? What did I do?

Sorry. I had to get the spotlight off me.

And tearing down women
is part of my pageant training.

Okay, we are reading that right now.

- Please don't.
- We got embarrassed tonight, come on.

- But it's personal.
- Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?

No.

- Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.
- It's not about me and Sheldon.

It's about a young woman
in the 1800s named Amelia...

...and the time-traveling physicist
named Cooper she falls in love with.

- Oh, please show us?
- Please.

- No.
- Uh! You know I'm gonna read it either way.

Good luck finding it.

[SCOFFS]

"Amelia and the time-trav..." Found it. Ha, ha.

"It was just past dawn on the prairie
and like every morning...

...Amelia prepared to do her chores.

Except something about this morning
felt different."

Why?

Why did it feel different?

"Maybe it was the first whisper
of winter in the air.

Or maybe it was the unconscious
handsome man with porcelain skin...

...and curious clothing
she was about to discover lying in the field.

A man who would open
her mind to new possibilities...

...and her body to new feelings."

You know, there was a time
when I was alone and had no friends.

I'm starting to miss that.

He still hasn't responded.
What's taking him so long?

- Do you really want him to write back?
- Yeah, I do.

No matter how he responds,
I'm going to destroy him...

...with a picture of a bored cat,
saying "Oh, really?"

Mee-wow.

What are you doing?

I've created some other user accounts so I
can post positive comments about their paper.

"This wee little bairn of a theory
nearly blew my kilt off"?

No. You have to read it
how Dr. Angus McDoogal...

...of the University of Edinburgh would.

[SCOTTISH ACCENT]
"This wee little bairn of a theory...

...nearly blew me kilt off."

Oh! He wrote back.

"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting
to juvenile attempts at humor...

...is proof they have nothing
to back up their ridiculous paper.

It should come as no surprise
given they work at Caltech...

...essentially a technical school where
even the physicists are basically engineers."

Engineers?

Do you know how insulting that is?

Yes.

Guys, this person's just going
out of their way to get a rise out of you.

Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

All the other comments said nice things.
Focus on those.

Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik
of Moscow University said:

[RUSSIAN ACCENT]
"This paper great. I love it more than vodka."

See? Better with the accent.

- And send.
- What did you write?

I'm done hiding from bullies.
I am taking this into the real world.

- What does that mean?
- I told him we'll meet face-to-face.

Anytime, anywhere.

You crazy?
You don't know who this person is. Delete that.

- Yeah, come on, Sheldon.
- Okay, okay, calm down.

[COMPUTER CHIMES]

It's him.

He's trying to video chat.

Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this
into the real world.

Oh, really?

"'Time travel, I don't understand, '
said Amelia.

Cooper stared at her,
'Which word don't you understand...

...time or travel?"'

Wow, even in your fantasies
Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

He's like that in the beginning
so she can change him.

It's called good writing.

And wishful thinking.

"It stung Amelia
when he spoke to her this way.

In her one-room schoolhouse
she was always the smartest student...

...regularly besting the boys in her class.
But this was no boy in front of her.

This was a man."

Here we go.

"Cooper told Amelia about all the
incredible things the future would hold...

...like computers and living past 30.

He asked her if she had any questions.

All she longed to ask was if his heart
was beating as fast as hers...

...but she was too afraid
to hear the answer."

Oh, Amelia.

"So instead she asked if in the future
Montana ever became a state."

Hey, in the 1800s,
that was considered flirting.

I'm so sick of people
being mean on the Internet.

I think the anonymity makes everyone
feel like they can say things...

...they'd never say to your face.

Interesting.

I can't think of a single thing
I wouldn't say to someone's face.

I never noticed that about you.

You know what,
at least you guys did something.

You know, you had a theory, you wrote
a paper, you made an actual contribution.

All guys like this do is just tear down
other people's work.

He's right.

You know, I say we call this person back.

We've got no reason to hide.

All right, do it. Call him.

Let's find out what this loser's
ever accomplished.

Click it with me.

- One, two, three, click.
- Click.

[COMPUTER DIALING]

HAWKING [OVER COMPUTER]:
<i>Well, hello, there.</i>

Professor Hawking?

<i>Oh, brother, you should see
the look on your faces.</i>

You really didn't like our paper?

<i>I like your paper very much.</i>

<i>The premise is intriguing.</i>

Then why are you attacking us?

<i>If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years,
you'd get bored too.</i>

<i>Anyway, gotta go.</i>

<i>I promised to help the neighbor kid
with his math homework.</i>

<i>Ciao.</i>

Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Heh.

He said the premise is intriguing.

Good to see you again,
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-Liked-Our-Paper.

And you as well,
Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

How do you do,
Mr. I'll-Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.

"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood
before the newly-repaired time machine.

She regretted giving Cooper
the part he needed."

Because she wanted him
to give her the part she needed.

- Okay, that's enough.
- No, I really wanna know what happens.

And Bernadette really, really,
wants to know what happens.

You're just making fun of me.

No, I was just kidding, I'm sorry.
And the story's really good.

No, it is. Does he stay?

Do they kiss?
Does she find out about Montana?

Please?

Fine.

"As Cooper prepared to depart,
tears filled Amelia's eyes.

He took her hand in his and said,
'I can't stay, but I will never forget you.'

He brushed his fingers against her cheek,
then quickly stepped into the machine.

'Please don't go, ' she whispered,
but it was too late.

The engine hummed to life."

But they didn't even kiss.

"She turned away, wiping her eyes.
She couldn't bear to watch...

...her one chance at true love
disappear forever.

Then she felt a strong hand
on her shoulder spin her around.

It was Cooper."

[INHALES]

Yes.

"'What about the future?' asked Amelia.

He looked deeply into her eyes
and whispered:

'There is no future without you.'

He pulled her in close.

She began to tremble all over.

She felt his warm breath..."

- You will not believe what Stephen Hawking...
- Get out!

Is the water warm enough?

Given the fact that you took the time
to build a wood fire...

...draw the water from the well and heat it,
it would be rude to complain.

But since you asked, it's a little nippy.

I can fix that.

I couldn't help but notice
your unusual undergarments.

They're not undergarments.
They're Underoos.

Where I come from, they're known
as "Underwear that's fun to wear."

And what's the significance of the spider?

Oh, that represents Spider-Man.

He does whatever a spider can.

There's a lot of rhyming in the future,
isn't there?

You're right.
This is even weirder than I thought.

- You want me to stop reading?
- Are you kidding? No, no.

"As he stood for Amelia to dry him..."

So tell me, Cooper...

...are the ways of physical love
different in the future?

Yeah, okay, I'm good.

[English - US - SDH]

I've invented a science joke...

- ...would you like to hear it?
- Sure.

How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

- How many?
- Who cares?

He stole the idea
and doesn't deserve his own joke.

Is that really true?

Of course.
That's how you know it's a good joke.

It not only entertains, it informs.

Hey, sorry to interrupt.

Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

Did you know Edison
didn't actually invent the lightbulb?

What do you want, Barry?

Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank-you for Amy.

- What's this for?
- Your idea really helped me out.

My light-cone quantization paper's
online already.

The response has been amazing.

That's fascinating, I can't wait to read it.

Oh, no. Me, as well.

Please e-mail it to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

Why "dot biz"?
Because I just gave you the business.

And also, Bazinga.com was taken.

Anyway, thanks again.

Cooper, suck eggs.

Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?

I'd been thinking about a cellular approach
to neuronal connectivity...

...and thought it might have applications
to string theory.

- It's not a big deal.
- Oh, really?

When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end...

...why didn't you try to help me?

I did. You said the only math
biologists know...

...is if you have three frogs and one hops away,
that leaves two frogs.

That's pretty funny, that does sound like me.

But it doesn't mean you should be
standing on street corners...

...handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.

Sheldon, we're all scientists.
I helped out a fellow colleague.

- You're being petty.
- I'm being petty?

You know Barry and I have
a professional rivalry.

You heard him, he told me to suck eggs.

If we were friends, he would've suggested
I suck something pleasant.

Why are you laughing?

Did you learn something?

Okay, Ma, say hi to Aunt Gladys.

Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

- Your mom having fun in Florida?
- Oh, she loves it.

She finally found a place where
everyone talks about how sweaty they are.

She wants us to go to the house
and check in on Stuart.

"Because he might be lonely."

She's just being nice.

I'm her son, how come she doesn't
send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?

Because you have a wife?

Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.

I know you don't like Stuart in the house...

...but the store's about to reopen,
he'll get back on his feet.

That'd be great. I'd love for things
between me and Mom to get back to normal.

Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.

- Hey.
- Hello.

- You okay?
- If I was okay...

...I would've said "Hello"
and not the more ominous "Hello."

- What's going on?
- I'm mad at Amy.

Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top too?

No.

She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.

Oh. That sounds like a good thing.

Well, it would be, except I left string theory...

...because I decided it was a dead end...

...and then she went behind my back
to help someone else prove me wrong.

My rival, no less.

[GRUNTS]

I'm sorry you had to see that.

I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

Why would she do this to me?

Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.

Don't you say there's nothing more important
than the advancement of science?

No. I said there's nothing more important
than me advancing science.

If I'm understanding this
and all she did was help another scientist...

...I'm thinking you might have to
let this one go.

Ugh. "Let it go."
I have heard that my whole life.

Every time something upsets me,
somebody says, "Let it go."

Like it's my fault
and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.

[PENNY SIGHS]

I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you talk to her?

Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits
like, "Talk to her" and "Let it go"?

Gee, Penny, life's given me lemons,
what should I do?

Well, you could shove them somewhere.

Okay, now you're getting creative.

Thanks again for your help.

- No problem. Place really looks great.
- Our pleasure.

Yeah, you should have burned it down
years ago.

I keep telling you, I didn't burn it down.

We know. Because burning something
down for the insurance money is a crime.

Stuart, this place looks amazing.

- Thanks.
- You really did a nice job.

And thank you for putting up with me
staying at your mom's through all this.

I couldn't have done it otherwise.

I appreciate that.
And I'm glad you were able to...

Is that my mother's furniture?

Yeah, she said I could use it.
Doesn't it look great?

Not as great as it looks in the den,
where it belongs.

- Howie.
- Why don't you clean out the whole room?

Take the string-art clown
I made her in third grade...

...and the ribbon I got in swim class
for putting my face in the water.

What is your problem? She said it was okay.

Well, I'm her son. And I say it's not okay.

Some son. Looks like you spent
10 minutes on that clown art.

I should've gone to an art school...

...then I could run a failed comic shop
and mooch off some guy's mother.

- Why don't we leave so you can cool off?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

- Take him out of my store.
- Your store?

My mother gave you the money to reopen.
I'm not going anywhere.

Why don't we go get the food for the party?

- Thank you.
- Smart. It looks like we're being helpful.

When really we're just exiting
an uncomfortable situation.

Kripke. Of all the people, Barry Kripke...

Are you folding that like a crazy person
to get me to do it for you?

No.

Oh, give me that.

Just out of curiosity...

...if I were to let something go,
how would I do that?

I don't know,
just think about something else.

- Can I think about the spiny anteater?
- Sure.

The spiny anteater...

...never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.

That didn't help at all.

You know, some people try visualization.

How does that work?

Okay.

Imagine your problems are a pen.

- Okay.
- Now, imagine you're holding that pen.

Okay.

Now, open your hand and let it go.

But I just got this pen.

It's got my initials on it and everything.

Look.

Sheldon, this isn't that hard.

- I may have a better way you can teach me.
- How?

What if I told you
that over the past few months...

...Amy has secretly been
giving you little puzzles...

...to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

- What? She didn't give me any puzzles.
- Are you sure?

Boy, I just can't seem
to get these scissors back together.

Can you do it?

Darn it, there's something in my eye,
and I need to sort these coins by size.

Can you help?

Penny, I really want to eat this banana...

...but it's stuck inside
this bamboo puzzle box.

Son of a bitch!

Okay. That's great. Now, let it go.

I can't believe you were testing me
against a chimp!

Excuse me, Amy was testing you,
I was rooting for you.

Good job on that banana box, by the way.

Why would she even do this?

She's been conducting
an experiment on apes...

...where they're given puzzles to solve.

I was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles...

...and thought some humans
wouldn't solve them.

And that's when Amy said,
"Wanna make this interesting?"

Make this interesting?
You bet money on me?

No, no, we designed an experiment
involving you.

See, now, isn't that interesting?

It's not interesting, it's incredibly insulting.

Okay, maybe this will help.

Imagine you're holding a pen.

Before you go too far, not a special pen...

...with your initials engraved on it.

- That'll make the next part really hard.
- Oh, my God.

That's it. Get out.

I don't understand why you're mad at me.

You should be mad at Amy,
like I was this afternoon.

- Hey, look at that, I let it go.
- Get out!

SHELDON: Penny.
- What?

I think I left my pen in there.

I understand why you're upset...

...but he worked really hard
to get the store ready.

And it's just furniture.

It's my mom's furniture.

It belongs in the house I grew up in
next to that pile of <i>TV Guides...</i>

...and in plain view of what,
for a 10-year-old...

...was a quality piece of string art!

Howie, if the store succeeds...

...Stuart has a source of income
and can move out of your mother's house.

It seems some furniture
is a reasonable price to pay for that.

That is a good point.
I didn't marry you for good points.

I married you to blindly support me
no matter how ridiculous I'm being!

This is why I had to
rewrite our wedding vows.

We're here to pick up an order
for Comic Center.

Sure. Let me go check on that.

Dude, I think that's Nathan Fillion.

Oh, yeah, look at that.

And he's picking the tomatoes
out of his salad just like I do.

I always did feel a connection with him.

Oh, I have got an idea.

We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.

No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from <i>Firefly...</i>

...to do a signing at Stuart's store,
that would be amazing.

- That would be great.
- Should we go talk to him?

I don't know. If he's not nice...

...it's gonna make it hard for me
to watch him in anything again.

The guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk.
We still watch <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.

I was distracted.

It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch
with a kayak strapped to his car.

Come on.

Hi, excuse me. Don't mean to bother you,
but we're just really...

We're big fans of <i>Firefly.</i> And <i>Dr. Horrible.</i>

Oh, I think you made a mistake.
I'm not an actor.

Don't say that.

I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,
but you're pretty great.

I get it. You think I'm Nathan Fillion...

...but I'm not, so if you don't mind,
I would just love to eat my lunch.

Come on. Sorry to bother you.

Don't know why he's so grumpy.

I got mistaken for that guy
in <i>Life of Pi</i> once, I'm still floating.

Sheldon, it's me.

Uh, hey, did you see that?

I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.

Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage
to celebrate.

What are you talking about?

I know you've been giving me
secret puzzle tests.

- Sheldon, open the door.
SHELDON: I can't.

I'm naked.

I just saw you.

Hang on.

Open the door now.

- Oh, hey.
- Pull up your pants!

It's not a big deal.

I run tests like this
on undergrads all the time.

If you fill out some paperwork at the university,
I can get you $5.

I don't want $5. I want my dignity.

What are we talking, like 10 bucks?

- Thank you.
- Thanks.

- Sorry again.
- No problem.

Uh, are you sure you're not him?

You can tell us.
We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.

All right, fine. I'm him.

And you're eating alone at a deli?

I don't buy it. You're not him.

I wanted to eat my lunch in peace...

...but I really am him,
and thank you very much for being a fan.

If you want, uh, let's take a picture.

- That would be great. Thank you.
- You bet.

Wait, hang on.

If you're really Nathan Fillion...

...what's the line from <i>Firefly</i>
about your bonnet?

I swear by my pretty floral bonnet,
I will end you.

That's it. That's the line.

Although, I knew the line.
Doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

- Do you want the picture or not?
- I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.

How about a picture with a guy
who looks like Nathan Fillion...

...but a little more annoyed
than Nathan Fillion usually is?

What do you think?

Eh, it's good enough for Facebook.

I can't believe they did that.

I know, it's so insulting.

At one point, they had me figure out
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.

Wait. Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.
He was testing me too.

Unbelievable.

And how could a chimp even solve that?
That was impossible.

Really? You couldn't get it out?

- Thank you.
AMY: Wow, the store looks great.

So you guys were testing us both?
What is the matter with you?

What's the matter is they think they're so smart
they don't care if they hurt others' feelings.

- That's not true.
- Sounds like us.

I still don't understand why you're upset.

You solved every puzzle
faster than all of the chimps.

Well, except Barnabas,
but he was on Adderall.

I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.

Can you please just let it go?

Oh, I can help you with that.

Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen.

While your favorite pen
is safe and secure in your pocket.

[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

Hold that thought. Hello?

How can I make this up to you?

The answer's in this puzzle box.
Let's see if you can open it.

You could have warned him
about the furniture.

That's what I said when we moved it.

You helped him?

No, Stuart picked out those
throw pillows all on his own.

Hey, you okay?

- No.
- What's wrong?

My mom died.

What?

[CLEARS THROAT]

That was my aunt.

Ma took a nap.

She never woke up.

Oh, my God, Howie.

I'm so sorry.

What can we do?

I don't know.

- May I say something?
- Not right now, Sheldon.

- But I think it would be comforting.
- No, it's okay.

What?

When I lost my own father...

...I didn't have any friends
to help me through it.

You do.

I really thought he was gonna say,
"Let it go."

Okay. Thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe.

Okay, bye.

Uh, they booked a flight,
they're heading to the airport now.

How's Howard holding up?

- He's hanging in there.
- How are you doing, Stuart?

I still can't believe she's gone.
I mean, that woman took me in.

If it wasn't for her,
I would have been homeless.

One of us would have taken you in.

Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

But you know what?
I'm glad it worked out the way it did...

...because I got to know
this wonderful person.

Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.

When I first moved to America...

...Howard was my only friend...

...and she made me feel
so welcome in her home.

Which says a lot,
because those first few years...

...she thought I was the gardener.

Whenever I saw her she'd say
I was too skinny and try and feed me.

She did that to me too.

Don't take this away from me.

I didn't care for her yelling.

But now that I'm not going
to hear it again, I'm sad.

If you want, I can yell at you later.

It won't be as good.

Let's have a toast.

To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother...

...to all of us.

We'll miss you.

[English - US - SDH]

I just read about an experiment...

...to see if you can make two people
fall in love in hours.

That doesn't sound right.

My research has shown that it takes
three to five years of shameless begging.

Honey, neither of us comes off good
in that story.

Yeah, I saw that article you're talking about.

The participants ask each other
a series of questions...

...designed to promote intimacy.

And finish it off by staring
into each other's eyes for four minutes.

Oh, that's nonsense.
I proclaimed my love for you...

...and the last time I looked into your eyes
was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.

Other than the fact that I had it,
that was a magical night.

Raj, would you try an experiment
like that with Emily?

I don't need science to win her heart.

I have my family's wealth for that.

I'm telling you, you can't create love
in a few hours. Right?

Careful. You're poking
at the whole foundation of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

Yeah, well, we don't have to debate this.
We're scientists.

We can conduct our own research.

- I propose that we imprison two street people...
- No.

- You didn't even let me finish.
- Forget it.

Oh! So you can experiment
on all the apes you want...

...but I wanna manipulate the emotions
of two captive human beings...

...suddenly I'm the monster.

Why don't you just do the test?

In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.

You're okay with an experiment
where you answer questions...

...about your innermost feelings?

- Yes.
- Please, can I do it with him? Please?

I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings
on things for 10 years.

Tag, you're it.

- Yeah, but what if the experiment works?
- I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.

AMY:
That's what I said.

Before I knew it,
he pontificated his way right into my heart.

Uh, fun fact: "Pontificate"
comes from the Latin word "pontifex"...

...which means bridge builder or pope.

In love yet?

Just out of curiosity, Penny...

...if this experiment
does make us fall in love...

...would you drive me to Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin, for Gary Con?

It's the only convention
celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax...

...the cocreator of Dungeons & Dragons.

You know what?
I can honestly say if we fall in love...

...not only will I drive you there,
I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.

Okay, babe, let's do this.

You guys are really being calm
about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing.

- Uh, if it were me, I'd be a little nervous.
- Why?

Even if the study's nonsense,
I don't believe in tempting fate.

Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board
or pick a fight with an Asian guy.

Probably doesn't know karate,
but why risk it?

I think we're safe.

That's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's
high school thought, and then, bam, karate.

Are we just gonna sit here
while they do the experiment?

- The two of us could do it.
- Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

- What's the first question?
- Hang on. Okay.

"Given the choice of anyone in the world,
whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

Hmm.

I can honestly say Penny.

Awww.

Then I choose a janitor,
because I'm about to throw up.

I'm in love. Let's do something else.

Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.

- Why don't the four of us go out?
- Okay.

- Sounds good.
- Should we call Howard and Bernadette?

I don't know when their plane gets in.
Let me shoot them a text.

Did he say anything about the funeral?

Not much,
but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.

Are you kidding me?
You lost my mother's ashes?

No, I'm just saying
that sometimes bags are misrouted.

All right, fine. Where did you misroute
the only woman who ever loved me?

The first wo... First. I meant first.

I just need some information.
Uh, what's the flight number?

Eight-sixteen.

- I really did mean first.
- Just drop it.

And can you describe the bag?

Um, it's, uh, black.
There's a red ribbon tied to the handle...

The world's greatest mom
is in the shoe compartment.

- Are you ready to begin?
- Yeah, be right there.

- I assume you don't want wine.
- Correct.

You're not supposed to drink alcohol
when operating heavy machinery.

What heavy machinery?

Let's just start.

Well, as a Texas gentleman,
I'm inclined to say ladies first.

Although I'm concerned
that level of politeness and charm...

...might make you fall in love with me
before the test even begins.

Perhaps we should flip a coin.
Or if you're familiar with the rules...

- ...of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard..."
- Question one.

"Given the choice of anyone in the world,
whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

Hmm.

- Living or dead?
- It just says "anyone in the world."

- I guess that means living.
- Eh, it's just as well.

As much as I'd love to meet Euclid,
inventor of the geometric proof...

...he probably wore sandals,
and I cannot look at toes during dinner.

Oh, I know.

The person I'd most like
to have dinner with is myself.

You sure that's your choice?
Because I've had that dinner.

Well, I haven't.

And while they say never meet your heroes,
I just don't see how I could disappoint.

- Who would you choose?
- Robert Downey Jr.

Ye-Oh...

I didn't think of Iron Man.

Maybe after myself and I have dinner,
we can meet you two for dessert.

[SIGHS]

- So, what do you guys wanna do?
- We're the ones tagging along. You pick.

Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?

- Uh-uh, what's that?
- Um, it's kind of like interactive theater.

You have to solve puzzles
in a certain amount of time to get out.

There's one downtown
where they trap you in a room with a zombie.

LEONARD: Hmm.
RAJESH: Ooh.

So kind of like what's happening
with Penny right now.

"What would constitute a perfect day
for you?"

Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga...

...then lie on the beach
while cute cabana boys brought me drinks...

...and probably get a massage
and then cap off the night with some dancing.

That's it?

- Yeah, why?
- You didn't mention Leonard.

He's there.

I don't think so.

Leonard can't stand yoga,
the beach, massages or dancing.

Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay?
What's yours?

Uh, I wake up.

I enjoy some French toast
with butter and syrup.

Uh, then a wormhole opens...

...and whisks me millions of years
into the future...

...where my towering intellect is used
to save the last remnants of mankind...

...from a predatory alien race.

Interesting you didn't mention Amy.

Who do you think made the French toast
with butter and syrup?

You're about to enter the lab
of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

While conducting studies
on slowing the aging process...

...there was a catastrophic accident,
and he died.

Or did he?

- Ladies.
- Are you being polite or scared?

Yep.

[ALL OOH-ING AND AAH-ING]

[DOOR SLAMS AND LOCKS]

- This is cool.
- So how do we start?

We look for the clues
hidden around the room.

Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?

[SHRIEKS THEN WHIMPERS]

Okay, let's hope one of the clues
is written on a pair of clean underwear.

[ZOMBIE MOANS]

Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?

As far as I can tell,
your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

- So where is it?
- I don't know.

Perhaps somebody took it off the carousel
by mistake.

So some stranger has my mom?

Is that what you're telling me?

My poor mother can be anywhere
in Los Angeles right now?

I wish I was telling you that...

...um, but the passenger could have gotten
on an international flight.

Oh, okay, great,
so your entire job is to find lost luggage...

...and you've narrowed down the location
of my mother to the planet Earth.

I'm sorry.

Would 500 frequent-flyer miles help?
That could get you to Sacramento.

"If you could wake up tomorrow...

...having gained any one quality or ability,
what would it be?"

Well, not to steal from the Bible...

...but turning water into wine
sounds pretty good.

I don't think you're taking this seriously.

Come on. I'm just having some fun with you.

I believe what you're doing is using humor
to avoid vulnerability.

Fine.

Honestly?

If I could have one quality...

...I wish I could be as smart as you guys.

Ha! Keep dreaming.

- Sheldon.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

That was me having fun with you.

Look, you may not be
as academically inclined as are we...

Yes, that's how you say it.

...but you possess an intelligence I envy...

- Hmm?
- ...which leads me to my answer:

I would choose the ability
to read people's minds.

Well, I can't read people's minds.

Actually, that's not true.
I can read men's minds.

But only because it's usually the one thing.

When are we going to get robot eyes?

You're all alike.

Well, what I meant was...

...I often misinterpret how others are feeling.

Like, I can't always tell if someone
is only joking or laughing at me.

You know, like, if they're mad
at something I've done or just in a bad mood.

It's incredibly stressful.

- Really? You always seem so confident.
- Well, I'm not.

And if I could read people's minds,
life would be so much simpler.

Well, now I wish I had the ability
to make that stuff easier for you.

- Well, thank you.
- Mmm.

Wow. I just felt this wave of affection for you.

You sure it's not too much Bible juice?

And the wave is gone.

Brains.

- Keep it down. We're working here.
- Okay, we've got the cipher decoded.

How's it going with the globe?

- We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
- I'm putting the city names in the grid.

- That'll give us the code to the safe.
- Solve puzzle too fast. Slow down.

- Yep, got the code.
- Just saying, no refund for finish early.

Sure you don't wanna go home?

When the bag's returned,
they'll deliver it to us.

No. I'm not leaving without her.

You're right. We'll wait.

- I could have driven her.
- What?

The day she left for Florida...

...she asked me to drive her to the airport.

I was too busy...

...and I made her take a cab.

I was too busy.

There's no way you could have known.

Be right back.

- Excuse me.
- Yes?

You better find my husband's mother...

...because one way or another, we are walking
out of this airport with a dead woman.

[ZOMBIE MOANING]

Which book are we looking for?

- Uh, <i>Origin of Species.</i>
- Here it is.

- There's a black light.
- Oh, hang on.

[ZOMBIE MOANS]

RAJESH: Oh, okay.
Uh, "Brothers and sisters I have none...

...but this man's father is my father's son.

Who am I looking at?"

[ZOMBIE YELLS]

Yeah, yeah, we get it. You want brains.
Calm down.

Well, if I don't have a brother,
my father's son is me.

And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son.
The answer's "son."

- Ooh! There's a picture of the sun.
- Bet the key's behind it.

Could be somewhere else.

Oh! Got the key.

So that's the key to the door? That's it?

We spent $200 on six minutes of fun?

It's like when we bought
that remote-control helicopter...

...and it just flew away.

Sorry, guys.
I really thought the puzzles would be better.

Well, to be fair,
we do all have advanced degrees.

Remember that before you post on Yelp.

"If you were to die this evening with no
opportunity to communicate with anyone...

...what would you most regret
not having told someone?"

So it would be today? Huh.

Eh, I suppose there's something satisfying
about dying on my birthday.

- Today is your birthday?
- Yes.

Well, that's always been a secret.
Not even Amy knows.

[SIGHS]

Well, I don't enjoy presents...

...and the thought of people jumping out
and yelling, "Surprise!"...

...fills me with more dread than the words
"George Lucas director's cut."

So why'd you finally tell me?

The point of the experiment
is to be completely honest with each other.

Well, thank you for sharing it with me.
I won't tell anyone.

Thank you.

That is so funny.
I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.

You're making it difficult
to love you right now.

- Great news. Your bag was returned.
- Oh, thank God.

It's okay. She's here. Ma's here.

Oh, good. Thank you so much.

Ma, I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport.

I just want you to know that I'll never
forgive myself for being so selfish.

And I promise to keep you close
for the rest of my life.

Oh, no, that thing's gonna end up
in my bedroom.

That's it. We're done with the questions.

All that's left to do is stare
into each other's eyes for four minutes.

Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check.

We're good to go.

- You ready?
- Yes.

And begin.

This is kind of creepy.

- We're not supposed to talk during this part.
- Sorry.

This is kind of creepy.

Do you wanna stop?
I know you have trouble with eye contact.

Well, you have a brown fleck
in your right iris...

...that looks like a Formula One race car...

...so I'm just concentrating on that.

Plus, it's easier around people
that I'm comfortable with.

Aww. Sweetie, I'm comfortable around you too.

Of course you are. I'm warm and soothing.

I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.

I meant more like a little brother.

Oh.

Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister.

And sometimes a mother.

It's getting creepy again.

What?

Just thinking about the day
I met you and Leonard.

It was a Monday afternoon.
You joined us for Indian food.

Can you believe it's been eight years?

And you're still eating our food.

I can't remember a time
you guys weren't in my life.

I remember it perfectly...

...but I have an eidetic memory.

If you're interested, I also remember
how much you owe us for the food.

[TIMER CHIMES]

- That's it. That wasn't so bad.
- No, it wasn't.

Uh, now let's tabulate the results
of the experiment.

I think it's safe to say
that you're not in love with me...

...and I'm not in love with you...

...and psychology has once again
proved itself the doofus of the sciences.

Well, maybe, but I'm still glad we did it.

I do feel closer to you.

And I you.

And yes, that's how you say that.

So given our newfound intimacy...

...I'd say we have some hard choices
to make.

- Like what?
- Gary Con: Do we fly or drive?

Do we wear costumes?

And if so, who gets to be Gary?

Thank you for walking me home.

I just wanna make sure you get there safe.

Well, this is me.

- It's been a very interesting evening.
- It really has.

- Surprise!
- Aaaah!

And after I let you be Gary.

[English - US - SDH]

I was unstoppable. I mean, I was on fire.

It was like my mind and my body
were totally connected.

Like athletes must feel
when they're in the zone.

PENNY:
Again, it was miniature golf.

Admit it, you're a little turned on.

You can't be this proud.

- Why not?
- Because I beat you.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Oh, good, you're back.

We have some exciting news.

Okay.

As you know, Amy and I
have been together a long time...

...and a lot of things
I never thought possible...

...now seem possible.

Okay.

After a careful evaluation
of our relationship...

...we decided that the time was right
to take a step forward.

Okay.

Do you wanna say it?

Let's say it together.

- We're getting a turtle.
- We're getting a turtle.

See, this is why I've been saying
we should keep champagne on ice.

- Sarcasm?
- Yes.

That was tricky, because when it comes
to alcohol, she means business.

- Well, we're very happy for you.
- Yes.

Thank you.
Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.

No, it's true. It means that
we care so much about each other...

...there's enough left over
for an 8-ounce reptile.

Why a turtle?

Well, after much deliberation,
we've determined that a turtle...

...is the ideal pet.

They don't shed fur, they don't make noise...

For Halloween,
we can dress him as a cobblestone.

And if he ever goes berserk,
I know I can outrun him.

Coincidentally, that's also
why I chose you as a roommate.

Well, congratulations.

Who would've thought you would be
the first in our group to start a family?

That's what I said.

So where's your roommate tonight?

Well, I thought it was a little unfair
that she's always here...

...and you never get a chance
to stay over...

...so I killed her.

Remember our agreement.

You can joke about murdering people,
but you have to say "just kidding."

And the more important thing to remember
is that I'd never hurt you.

[CELL PHONE BEEPS]

Oh, crap.

I have to run over to the hospital
and check on a patient.

- That's okay. I can come back later.
- No, no, don't be silly.

I won't be gone long. Just stay here.

Okay, cool. You're sure your roommate's
not gonna come back while I'm here alone?

Because that would be awkward.

- Don't worry, she's in Palm Springs.
- Oh, good.

Well, her torso is.

Just kidding.

I put her in a wood chipper.

Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.

It's okay.

- You made it, we're fine.
- That was a lot of puppies.

Let's forget about them
and pick ourselves out a nice turtle.

Oh, how about this one up on the log?

Oh, I don't know.

He looks like a jerk.

How about this one?

He's barely moving. He looks half dead.

I know. I like him too.

Hi, little guy.

How'd you like to come home with us?

You'll be living with me,
because we don't live in the same house.

But that's not your fault.

Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow.

You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con,
or away for work.

Yeah, or if they accept
Daddy's application to live on Mars.

What are you talking about?

Well, there's this company that's attempting
to establish a colony on Mars...

...and I applied to be among the first to go.

What should we name him?

You know, I came in thinking "Seth"...

...but he kind of looks Italian.

You applied for a mission
to be a colonist on another planet...

...and couldn't be bothered to tell me?

Would you have approved?

Of course not.

Well, based on your reaction,
it looks like I made the right choice.

Isn't that right, Giuseppe?

Hey. Hey.

Listen, I have a little confession to make.

Aw. Is this your first time?

No, I got you something for Valentine's Day,
and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.

Well, why?

Because I got it at the dirty store.

You went to the dirty store without me?

In sunglasses and a hat
after I parked two blocks away.

- Well, get it. Get it for me.
- Yeah?

- Yeah.
- Okay. Uh, well, I hope it's fun.

It comes with paints
and it's kind of creative and artistic.

Okay, did you go to the dirty store,
or Michaels?

No, no, we cover ourselves in body paint...

...and then we get on this big canvas
and do our thing.

Whoa. It's kind of a big step for a guy
who only recently agreed to take his socks off.

- You're making fun of me. Forget it.
- No. No, I wanna do it.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Let's you, me and your very, very pale feet
make some art.

[LEONARD CHUCKLES]

When you go back to the store,
I wanna go with you.

Okay. But it's a drive.
The one I went to is in San Diego.

- How are the taxes going?
- Okay.

But you got a lot of receipts
for the Lego Store in here.

Those are business expenses.
You can write those off.

A $200 R2-D2 is a business expense?

Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound
a lot more confident when we get audited.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Hey. What's up?

Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital,
so I'm just hanging out at her place.

- What are you, uh...? What are you doing?
- Just playing video games...

...while Bernie does the taxes.

What are you, a little kid?

Is she gonna cut your dinner
into little pieces too?

She doesn't have to,
I filled up on jelly beans.

So, uh, what game are you...?

Oh, crap.

- What's wrong?
- I can't get Emily's nightstand to close.

- So?
- She's gonna know I was looking in it.

Why were you looking in it?

Well, there's a question I better have
a good answer to before she gets back.

Okay, calm down.
There's probably something jammed behind it.

- Just pull it out and see what's there.
<i>- Hang on.</i>

Oh, no. Oh, no.

<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

You know what? You sound busy.
I'm gonna let you go.

Dude, the whole front came off.
Now, she's gonna know I was snooping.

What's happening?

Raj was snooping through
Emily's drawers and broke one.

Aw. I'm gonna miss her.

So, what do you think?

I thought it'd be a little more...

Just more.

I'm not even sure
why we were out of breath.

I mean, did we move at all?

Maybe along the Z axis...

...but X and Y are looking pretty sad.

Come on, we are not old, boring people.
We could do better than this.

That's true.
How late did we stay up last night?

Almost 1 a.m.

Damn straight, almost 1 a.m.

And we weren't even watching TV,
we were watching Netflix like the kids do.

Yeah. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama?
Nobody knows.

Come on. We are gonna do this.

You get the paint, I'll rest for 30 to 40 minutes,
and then we do this.

I can't believe you almost had me
bring a wild animal into my home.

No one told you to poke the turtle's face.

I was playing Got Your Nose.

That's how you get children to like you.

I'm surprised you care if he likes you...

...since you're leaving the planet
the first chance you get.

This again. Amy, I've already had
one new hole torn in my body today...

...I don't need another one.

Sheldon, I know the odds of you
even going to Mars are incredibly small...

...but it hurts that you would volunteer
for something...

...that would take you away from me forever.

You wouldn't leave me...

...for the chance to be one of the first humans
to colonize another planet?

I would at least mention it
before filling out the application.

Huh. That's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz,
Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.

And who says you could even survive
an interplanetary mission anyway?

You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.

First of all, this...

...has only made me stronger.

But beyond that,
all I did was fill out an application.

You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.

Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

No, forget it.

- What if I play the <i>Star Trek</i> theme on my nose?
- Please don't.

[HUMMING "STAR TREK" THEME
THROUGH NOSE]

Yep, you're mad.

- Okay, let me see the damage.
RAJ: <i>Hang on.</i>

I think you broke the dowels.

You won't have time to glue it.
You'll have to nail it.

<i>- With what?</i>
- Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?

- She does.
<i>- Great.</i>

Neither of those. Try a hammer!

Did that feel good?
You feel like a big man now?

I was going to make you Red Zinger...

...but since Mars is the red planet,
I went with peppermint.

Why do you even wanna do this?

Actually...

...as part of the application,
I was required to make a short video...

...answering that very question.

- You wanna see it?
- Can't you just tell me?

But I made a video.

SHELDON [ON VIDEO]:
<i>I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper...</i>

<i>...and I'd like to tell you
why I should be chosen to...</i>

[ECHOES]
<i>...go to Mars!</i>

<i>I'm exceedingly smart.
I graduated college at 14.</i>

<i>While my brother was getting an STD,
I was getting a PhD.</i>

<i>Penicillin can't take this away.</i>

<i>Being in close quarters,
cleanliness is important.</i>

<i>And my hygiene is impeccable.</i>

<i>In fact, animals don't trust me...</i>

<i>...because I smell like nothing.</i>

[SNIFFS]

<i>Literally nothing.</i>

<i>During the seven-month space flight,
I can keep up morale...</i>

<i>...with my wacky sense of humor.</i>

<i>Hey, Leonard...</i>

<i>...is there any peanut brittle left in that can?</i>

<i>You mean this weirdly suspicious one?</i>

<i>Yes. Open it and check.</i>

<i>I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle...</i>

<i>Please go to Mars.</i>

<i>But on a more serious note...</i>

<i>...the most important reason
I wanna go to Mars...</i>

<i>...is that I believe, as a scientist...</i>

<i>...it's my duty to push the boundaries
of human knowledge forward.</i>

<i>Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult.</i>

<i>But life here on Earth is no picnic.</i>

<i>Also, picnics are no picnic.</i>

<i>"Where should we go for lunch?
Oh, I know, the ground."</i>

<i>In conclusion,
thank you for considering me...</i>

<i>...for this journey of a lifetime.</i>

[ECHOES]
<i>To Mars.</i>

Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose
and pie came out.

LEONARD:
Right there.

Right there. Oh, God, that's it.

- How did you get paint in your eye?
- You wouldn't let me wear safety goggles.

This looks terrible. She... She's gonna know.

<i>It's fine. You just need two more nails.</i>

- Okay, where should I put them?
<i>- In Emily's eyes.</i>

You're not helping.

<i>Well, maybe this is what you get
for snooping.</i>

- It's bad enough that I have to deal...
EMILY: Raj?

- I'm back.
- Oh, no.

- Hey.
- Hi.

How...? How's the hospital?

Fine. What were you doing in there?

Uh, we... Well...

Look, I don't wanna lie to you.
I got curious, I was looking around...

...and I broke the drawer on your nightstand.

- You were looking in my nightstand?
- Yeah.

So the first time I leave you alone,
you snoop on me?

- You've never snooped around my apartment?
- No.

Come on, think back.
It would really help if you had.

EMILY: <i>I can't believe you don't trust me.</i>
- She sounds really mad.

- We should hang up.
- Yeah, we should.

- But we're not going to, are we?
- Not a chance.

What happened to "snooping is wrong"?

Oh, we're already going to jail for tax fraud.
Who cares?

Well, we did it.

We sure did.

I mean, I was on fire.

I was in the zone like an athlete.

Sweetie, I beat you at this too.

So where do we wanna hang it?

What, are you kidding?
We're not hanging it.

But it's an expression of our love.

And our butts. Not hanging it.

Seems a shame to throw it away.

Yeah.

Oh. We can give it to Sheldon
and tell him William Shatner painted it.

God, I love you. I love you so much.

I think I'm gonna go home.

Why?

I really don't understand
what's happening here.

You know, Sheldon, at any other time...

...learning that you had plans to go live
on Mars would be a slow news day.

But a couple of hours ago,
we were getting a turtle.

And silly as it sounds...

...I thought that meant something.

Amy.

Why didn't I give her Sleepytime tea?

Amy, wait.

Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me too.

Sure. Unless something better comes along.

Do you want me to withdraw my application?

What I want is for us to be
planning our future together.

And in that future...

...are we on the same planet?

Because I've seen people
make the long-distance thing work.

- We're on the same planet!
- Okay.

Does that planet have to be Earth?

Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?

I am.

Yeah, if I'm going to a barren,
lifeless environment...

...where the chances of survival
are slim to none...

...I want you there with me.

Why don't we go back to the apartment
and fill out your application?

Okay.

I suppose being the first people
on a new planet...

...would be incredibly exciting.

I know.

We could be the first
to plant a flag on Mars.

We could be the first
to watch <i>Mars Attacks!</i> on Mars.

We could be the first to say:

"Good Lord.
What on Mars are you talking about?"

You know, we could also be
the first people to procreate on Mars.

You just can't keep it in your space pants,
can you?

Think about it. If we had a family there,
our kids would be Martians.

They would, wouldn't they?

We could give them cool Martian names...

...and we could teach them
about Martian history.

Like, "Who planted those flags?"

And, uh, "Where'd that copy
of <i>Mars Attacks!</i> come from?"

I guess we'll have to make
a new video together as a couple.

Good idea. Yeah...

And since you've had such a rough day...

...I'm gonna let you throw the pie
in Leonard's face.

- Thank you for forgiving me.
- It's okay.

At some point,
we were bound to have our first fight.

Well, it almost happened
when you called my apple-pie crust doughy.

The truth is you were right,
and I was just angry at myself.

Can I ask you one thing?

Of course. What?

Did you look in my closet?

- No, just the drawer.
- You promise you didn't look in the closet?

I promise. Why, what's in there?

Don't worry about it.

Good night.

[English - US - SDH]

...two, one, six, four, two,
zero, one, nine, eight, nine.

And that, little lady,
is pi to a thousand places.

I'd say I'm sorry I asked,
except I didn't.

Oh, look, it's the <i>Scientific American</i>
that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.

Oh, let me see.

SHELDON: I have mixed feelings
about doing interviews.

I like the part where I talk.

I do not like the part
where the other man talks.

Sheldon, this article
doesn't mention Leonard at all.

Oh, that can't be right.

It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his team."
Did you even talk about him?

SHELDON: All I did was answer
a few questions about the theory.

Then expressed my gratitude
that <i>Scientific American...</i>

...doesn't include
any of those smelly perfume cards.

Poor Leonard.

Why? The theory he came up with
just got mentioned in <i>Scientific American.</i>

- He ought to be thrilled.
- He might not be.

Oh, maybe you're right.

He is kind of a lump.

Think about it. How would you feel if you were
referred to as part of Leonard's team?

Oh, I'd be incensed.

So you see what I'm getting at?

Squeaky wheel gets the grease?

AMY:
No.

Grass is always greener?

AMY: Try again.
SHELDON: Well, I don't know.

We're all Groot? Just tell me.

Leonard is as much a part of this paper
as you are, and he was overlooked.

He's going to feel bad.

But it wasn't my fault.

I didn't exclude him,
and I didn't write the article.

Remember when you didn't get picked
to pull the sword out of the stone...

...at Disneyland
and they let that kid do it?

Oh, that kid.

Poor Leonard.

Exactly.

For the record,
that kid was a terrible choice.

If you cry when you drop your churro,
you do not have what it takes to rule England.

Thanks for helping us
sort through all my mom's stuff.

Of course.

I know what it's like having to go through
a loved one's possessions.

My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna.

But after he died, you know what we found?

A statue of Shiva.

It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay,
but in India, it's a thing.

It'll be good that you're there.

Howard's been having trouble deciding
what to keep or let go.

Well, it's hard.

A lot of Ma's stuff
brings back fond memories.

Is that why you couldn't get rid of
her drawer full of ketchup packets?

Yes. It reminds me of us eating out...

...and her saying, "Nobody's looking.
Fill your pockets with ketchup."

Leonard...

...have you ever noticed...

...that only my name is on the cable bill?

- Yeah.
- Good.

Good.

And your name is on the electric bill
and mine isn't.

And I'm okay with that.

Actually, your name is on the electric bill.

Oh, right.

This is a disaster.

I don't even know
what you're talking about and I agree.

Okay...

...I have to tell you something,
but you're not going to like it.

What's going on?

An article was just published
in <i>Scientific American</i> about our theory.

- Did they hate it?
- No. No, they loved it.

They couldn't say enough nice things
about it.

So, what's the problem?

You know how the PennySaver
only has my name on...?

Sheldon.

They didn't mention you
in the article, only me.

- Really?
- I know.

It's not fair.

Let the anger go, buddy.

You just... You relax all your muscles.

Except for your pubococcygeus
and anal sphincter.

Let's keep those tight.

Uh, that's not necessary.

It is. They're what hold back
the urine and feces.

Look, maybe you shouldn't read it.
It'll only make you feel worse.

"Cooper and his team"?

You should know,
I had nothing to do with that.

Uh...

At least they're talking about the theory.
I mean, that's what's important.

You know, you're right.

Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man.

Stan Lee may get all the credit...

...but Steve Ditko knows
he was just as important.

Even though Stan Lee
gets to be in all the Marvel movies.

And he's far richer.

And he's a household name, you know...

...whereas, you know, you say "Ditko,"
that sounds like a company that makes dits.

That's not helping.

Why, I'd give more examples...

...but, well, everyone in your position's
so forgettable.

Stuart, we're here.

Nice of you to let him keep staying
at your mom's house.

Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb,
but nobody took him.

Hey.

- Just so you know, the power's out.
- What happened?

I called, they said a transformer blew,
it's the whole block. To be fixed by tomorrow.

- Wait, when did it go out?
- In the middle of the night.

Oh, my God.

Howie, what's wrong?

It's all defrosting.

It's okay, it's just food.

It's not just food.

This is the last food my mother ever made.

This is her last brisket.

This is her last meat loaf.

This is her last...

I have no idea what this is,
but it's the last one.

- Everything okay?
- No.

All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.

Why don't we take it home
and put it in our freezer?

You don't want to do that.

Refreezing not only removes moisture,
but it creates ice crystals...

...in the fibers of the meat
that can compromise its taste and texture.

What? I saw a teachable moment,
I dropped some culinary science.

What should we do?

I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eat it.

- There's like 20 pounds of food in there.
- All you said was I had to get rid of things.

You didn't say they couldn't pass through
my colon first.

Howie.

Okay, then how about this?

Let's invite everyone over to dinner.

It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.

I love that.

Me too.

Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup
to cover every ounce of it.

I mean, who even reads
<i>Scientific American?</i>

It's kind of a big deal.

[PENNY SCOFFS]

Then how come the biggest celebrity
they could get for the cover is a molecule?

Can we please just stop talking about it?

- I'm sorry. What can I do?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

[PENNY SIGHS]

No, no, I'm gonna cheer you up. Ahem.

- Here we go.
- What are we doing?

I am taking you shopping.

My baby is sad,
and I'm gonna make him happy again.

Look, I know shopping cheers you up,
but it's just not really my thing.

Well, what about this helicopter
you control with an iPad?

Does it have a camera in it?

It does have a camera in it.

Baby's listening.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

SHELDON:
Leonard. Leonard.

- Leonard.
- What?

SHELDON:
I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.

Did you tell him it was my idea?

- I did.
- Thank you.

- What did he say?
- He said they made the editorial decision...

...to only cite the lead scientist.

Why did he think you're the lead scientist?

It was my idea.

For an extra 4 bucks,
I can have this thing here tomorrow.

Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter
said he's been following my work for a while.

The only reason they even mentioned it
is because my name is on it.

You know what? I did it. What's 4 bucks?

If you're trying to make me feel better,
it's not working.

Well, what if I told you
that I added your name to the cable bill?

- No.
SHELDON: Oh.

Just as well, they had me on hold
for 20 minutes. I hung up. I...

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Leonard. Leonard.

Leonard.

Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner.

So...

...I'm ready whenever you are.

- All he had was an idea.
- Well, that is an important part.

Oh, please. I have ideas all day long.

Reverse SeaWorld,
where dolphins are allowed to pet people.

A new clothing size
between medium and large, called "marge."

<i>Snow White</i> retold
from the point of view of Sneezy.

Why won't Doc prescribe him something?
We finally find out.

But Leonard's idea was good.

Fine, then Grumpy,
what's he so grumpy about?

Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.

I'm the one who thought of it.

Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?

But now he's happy to let people think
he's responsible for everything.

And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.

Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation
than he does?

It's not your fault.

Is it my fault that my name came first
on the paper alphabetically?

Not your fault.

Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me
as the lead scientist, I didn't correct him?

Hey, look at that pretty bird.

He always needs all the attention.
He's such a baby.

I know, I know.

He is never, ever playing with my helicopter.

Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.

- Thanks.
- Oh, man.

This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom. Heh-heh.

A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.

- Did she throw anything away?
- No.

If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.

Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets...

...four meat loafs, one lasagna...

No, that's noodle kugel.

One Jewish lasagna...

...two pound cakes
that are about 8 pounds each...

...and one giant container
of matzo ball soup.

Ma always kept it on hand in case I got sick.

She thought she could cure anything
with her cooking.

Even the time I got food poisoning.

From her cooking.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

- Let's get started.
- You got it.

I'm never gonna talk to her again.

[HOWARD EXHALES]

Should we tell everyone not to come?

No, I wanna do this.

Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.

Okay. Heh.

I'm not making any promises.

- Glad you guys could make it.
- Of course.

Looks really pretty in here.

Yeah. Turns out half a dozen menorahs
really sets a mood.

Have you thought about what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?

And there goes the mood.

Hi. Hello.

Oh, and a special hello to Leonard,
who needs to be mentioned by name.

- Subtle.
- Yeah, but you got it, right?

- Hey, guys.
AMY: Hi.

I just want everyone to know, uh,
tonight's not a sad occasion.

We just wanna have the kind of dinner
we've all had here so many times before.

Good food, good friends,
and sometime around midnight...

...heartburn that makes you pray for death.

- Need any help in the kitchen?
- No, we got it.

Make yourselves comfortable.

All right, hey, you two,
we're here for Howard right now, okay?

- Yes, so please behave yourselves.
- Fine.

Of course.

So I heard you two wrote a paper together.
How's that going?

This food is amazing.

And not a vegetable in sight.

That's not true.
We've got tomatoes right here.

All these bright people
sitting around a table by candlelight...

...feels like we could be
in an 18th-century French salon.

Indeed.

Penny, a salon is a gathering
where intellectuals entertained each other...

...with sparkling conversations...

- ...about issues of the day.
- Oh, so it's like <i>The View.</i>

Sheldon, <i>The View</i> is a daytime talk show
hosted by women.

Oh, I'm aware.
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

She played Guinan on <i>Star Trek: Next Gen.</i>

- Penny, <i>Next Gen</i> refers to <i>Star Trek...</i>
- Shut up.

I would like to propose a salon topic.

Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

The lead in <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a woman.

Marvel has made Thor a female.

Wait, who's "Tor"?

You know, Thor, the god of thunder.

As I was saying, is this a sign
that our society...

...is approaching gender equality?

Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.

It's true. At the store,
I had to put a seat on the toilet.

We won't know if there's equality
until female Thor has a baby...

...and the Avengers are cool
with her pumping breast milk at work.

I wonder if only a baby who is worthy
can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Heh.

Okay, new salon topic.

Salons: dumb thing from a long time ago...

...or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes? Discuss.

I don't believe it matters what the topic is.

What's crucial for a salon
is that we conduct the discussion...

...in an elevated and insightful way.

It's all about the execution.

Of course you'd focus on that,
rather than the inspiration.

Uh, new salon topic: What's more important,
an idea or its execution?

Oh, that's fun.

Yeah, good for you, Leonard.
That's a lovely little notion.

Kind of like, "I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago."

Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.

Hello? Oh, hold on.

Leonard, it's your uncle.
He says you just got burned.

- Sheldon.
- No, it's okay.

We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.

At least I am. Howard, what do you think?

Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.

I spend my days trying to take ideas
and make them real.

Well said, old chap.

I thought eloquence had died,
here it stands before us.

Starting today, it will go: Gettysburg Address,
"I have a dream," and what you just said.

Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do
is make fun of him and engineering.

Leonard, please. His mother just died.

- You're being ridiculous.
- Yeah, so are you.

Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,
I'd go to my real salon.

Lots of people could've had that idea.

But very few people could've worked out
the math the way I did.

Lots of people also didn't have that idea.

- Like everyone in the entire world except for me.
SHELDON: Oh.

Well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better
than everyone in the whole world.

Including those fighting for our freedom.

Well, I don't know about you,
but I support our boys overseas.

- And girls.
- You already ruined Thor. Give it a rest.

So I'm just supposed to be okay
with you hogging all the credit?

I didn't hog anything...

...unlike you and that weird lasagna
with raisins in it.

- You want some of this? I'll give you some.
- Sheldon, Leonard, living room right now!

She said my name first. That must kill you.

BERNADETTE: I don't know what you're doing,
but this is a very difficult time for my husband!

We're eating the last food
his mother ever made...

...and you were gonna throw it
at each other like children?

Whatever it is you're fighting about,
put it aside...

...go back in there, be a good friend to Howard
or there's no dessert for either of you!

Look at me when I'm talking to you,
and don't think...

You guys ever notice sometimes
Bernadette sounds like my mom?

- I don't hear it.
- No, not at all.

[PENNY AND AMY GROANING]

I don't think I've eaten that much
in my entire life.

It's why my people wandered the desert
for 40 years.

It took that long to walk it off.

You see, Penny,
the Israelites were in the desert...

Shut up.

I'm so glad you two are done fighting.

Right now, I'm just trying to burp
without throwing up.

Hang on.
<i>Physics Today</i> mentioned the paper.

- What'd they say?
- Who cares?

- Did they mention Leonard?
- They did.

ALL [HALF-HEARTEDLY]:
Yay.

Good news, I found more Tums.

ALL [ENTHUSIASTICALLY]:
Yay!

[English - US - SDH]

Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke
for our lecture at Berkeley.

Ooh, I like to laugh, but say it anyway.

Okay. Uh...

"What do you say to a graduate
of the UC Berkeley Physics Department?"

"I'll have fries with that." Heh.

Because his education hasn't prepared him
for a career in the sciences.

When they chase you out of there,
you have to run faster than Sheldon.

- Are you all set for your trip?
- Yeah, I think so.

Yeah, I just restocked the old PRK.

- PRK?
- Public restroom kit.

Everything a boy needs for making pee-pee
in new and strange places.

I don't see what's crazy about bringing a
backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.

Keep going.

And rubber gloves, air freshener...

...uh, noise-canceling headphones.

Oh, danger whistle.

Um... Pepper spray.

Ooh, a multi-language "occupied" sign.

Let's see. We have seat protectors,
uh, booties for my shoes...

...a clothespin for my nose.

Oh, and a mirror on a stick...

...so I can make sure the person in the stall
next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.

You're still worried some Berkeley girl
is gonna steal him away?

Yes, who do you think gave him
the danger whistle?

Would you like to play a physics car game
I invented called I Can't Spy?

It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy...

...but the added fun of subatomic particles
and waves outside the visible spectrum.

If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to
the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.

I'll begin. Uh...

I can't spy with my little eye...

...something passing right through us.

That soy Frappuccino I had. Heh.

Will you please play the game?

I can't spy with my little eye
something passing right through us.

I don't know. Um...

If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass
through a square centimeter every second...

...given the surface area of this car
is about 60,000 square centimeters...

...that means 3.9 times 10
to the 15th solar neutrinos?

I don't want to play anymore.

Haven't been on a road trip in a while,
this is fun.

We get it, you won the game, stop bragging.

We wrote a paper together. Now we get to go
to a university and talk about it.

That's pretty cool.

I suppose it is.

In fact, if you'd like to celebrate
with a little music...

...I'd be okay with that.

What?

This road trip just got crazy. Ha, ha.

Play that funky music, white boy.

I'm surprised you know that reference.

What reference?

I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.
We need help taking it all out to the driveway.

Can I be in charge of pricing?
I've been going to garage sales my whole life.

Can you believe I got these panty hose
for a nickel?

All right, Amy's in charge of pricing
and being 75.

- Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?
- Sure.

We had one of these growing up.
I used to play all the time.

Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.

Oh, I meant Beer Pong.

I had a table too, but I didn't have any friends,
so all I did was serve.

You can leave one side up
and play against it.

And if I had a friend,
they might have told me that.

Excuse me, why is there a sticker on this?

It's my TARDIS from <i>Doctor Who.</i>
I was planning on moving it in the house.

I think you just answered
your own question.

Come on, one day this may double in value
and be worth half what I paid for it.

We have a lot to do.
We don't need to decide this right now.

Well, I guess as long
as you're keeping an open mind.

Of course.

[WILD CHERRY'S "PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

<i>Play that funky music right</i>

<i>Play that funky music, white boy</i>

So they're requesting that the white boy
play the funky music, yes?

Yes.

And this music we're listening to right now
is funky as well?

Sure.

Let me ask you this.

Do you think this song is the music
the white boy ultimately plays?

It could be.

So it's like the musical equivalent
of Russell's paradox.

The question of whether the set of all sets...

...that don't contain themselves as members
contains itself.

- Exactly.
- Well, then I hate it.

Music should just be fun.

[MUSIC STOPS]

We're making great time.
We're gonna be there pretty early.

Will our hotel room be ready?

I doubt it.

Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby
for a long period of time...

...might attract the attention
of the hotel detective?

If we do, we'll just tell him
to "Hit the bricks, see."

Seems a little confrontational, but all right.

You know, we won't be very far
from Skywalker Ranch.

Ah. That's true.
But it's not like we can get in there.

- Why not?
- I don't think George Lucas...

...put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere
because he wanted people dropping in.

Yoda's swamp
was in the middle of nowhere.

Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere.

Hoth was in the middle of nowhere.

That's code, Leonard.

He wants us to drop in.

We do have time.
I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.

Yes. Oh.

I'm so excited and I just can't hide it.

Ooh. I'm about to lose control
and I think I like it.

What are you talking about?

So when do you guys think
you're gonna move in?

We're still figuring
how much remodeling we wanna do.

Tricky finding the balance...

...between tasteful modern
and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.

Have you made a decision
about the TARDIS?

I think I can sell it
if we call it "Big British Porta-Potty."

We're not selling it. It's mine.

You can't just decide.

How about I arm-wrestle you?

That's not fair.

It's like me challenging you
to a sexy pants contest.

- You could play Ping-Pong for it.
- I would do that.

How is that fair? You grew up with a table.

Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield
in an ongoing war between the Transformers...

...and the ThunderCats
for control of a bra I had found in the woods.

For every episode of <i>Doctor Who</i>
Leonard has made me sit through...

...I will play on your behalf
and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey...

...where I hate that I know it belongs.

Yes, Penny plays for me.

That's not fair.
She has upper body muscles.

Dude, three-time Sanskriti School
for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.

That's right. Raj can play for me.

Oh, you just chose champions.

Like reenacting the ancient German practice
of trial by combat.

Like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper
in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

- Leonard makes you watch that?
- No, I like that show.

It's got dragons and people doing it.

It's settled. Fate of <i>Doctor Who's</i> TARDIS will
be decided by a <i>Game of</i> Thrones-inspired...

...death match on the battlefield
of ThunderCats versus Transformers.

If you still have that bra,
I'll give you a nickel for it.

There it is.

It's just a gate.

On a road.

It wasn't even that hard to find.

- This is so amazing!
- I know!

- You wanna get a picture?
- I want more than a picture.

- I wanna go in.
- Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

Is that the attitude
that helped you get Penny?

No, but I don't have three years
to make that gate feel sorry for me.

Ye... There's a speaker box.

Drive up, push the button
and let's see what happens.

Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? Heh.

I'm a little nervous.

Well, get over it.

Confidence is key in these situations.

Right.

[INTERCOM BUZZES]

You pushed it. Are you out of your mind?

- MAN [OVER INTERCOM]: <i>Can I help you?</i>
- Uh, uh, uh...

We don't have an appointment and we don't
belong here, but we're, like, crazy big fans.

I mean, "crazy" for <i>Star Wars</i> crazy, not crazy
like we have a backpack full of duct tape.

Although we do have a backpack
that you really don't wanna look in.

You're blowing it.

We wanna meet George Lucas
and become his friends and play with him.

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>
<i>This speaker's not working. Just pull up.</i>

And that's how it's done.

All right, we've defeated the first challenge.

Now we must steel ourselves
to face the monster who defends the gate.

We're trying to get past a security guard,
not rescue Zelda.

I think what really needs to be rescued is
your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time.

So, what's the plan?

I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.

Honesty will never get us in.

Well, what's your plan?

All right, my plan
is predicated on the assumption...

...that they have a nurse's office...

...and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.

- Who are you here to see?
- I'm gonna tell you the truth.

Oh, you are killing me.

We don't have an appointment.
We're just fans of Mr. Lucas' work.

We thought we'd take a shot,
see if we could get in and look around.

Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.
I can't let you in.

What if I told you
that I was the voice of Yoda?

A recording session, I must attend.

I'm sorry. Don't listen to him.
We're actually physicists.

We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today.
We just... We had some time to kill.

Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys.

I can't let you in,
but I've got hats and T-shirts I can give you.

Thank you so much.

See?

Maybe honesty is the...
What are you doing?

Shedding the yoke of my oppressors,
you blind, sad little man.

Don't move.

Code A-A 23. A-A 23.

MAN [OVER RADIO]:
<i>Copy.</i>

SHELDON:
I can see the ranch, Leonard.

Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely.

I'd take a picture,
but people are chasing me.

I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it.

They have Tasers,
but they wouldn't dare use... Aah!

Come on, Raj.

You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong.

You are the menace of table tennis.

Put her away
because I don't have a third one.

Yes! Whoo!

Rajesh: 8, Penny: 4.

Sorry, he's really good.

Hey, Raj, if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,
how great would it look at your place?

- What?
- Yeah, what?

I don't know much about <i>Doctor Who</i>
but if, um...

...you were to put this right outside
your front door...

...and open up the back...

...it would be like your entire apartment
was the inside of the TARDIS.

Which is pretty cool, because on the show...

...the inside of the TARDIS
is bigger than the outside.

But then again,
I don't know much about <i>Doctor Who.</i>

Don't listen to her.
You and I go way back. We're like brothers.

We are. We are. Ahem.

Oh, no, what a terrible serve.

Sorry, brother.

- Eight-five.
- This is ridiculous. I want a new champion.

Amy, were you serious
about being able to serve?

Oh, it's been a long time.

I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.

- She's my champion.
- Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.

- I want Raj.
- Hey.

Oh, come on, like you even care.

Well, I care.

Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.

- I thought our friendship meant more to you.
- So did I.

- Do you think they're gonna call the police?
- I don't know.

Maybe they'll call Imperial officers
to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.

Oh, I think that's below the pay grade
of an Imperial officer.

- Stormtroopers are really the ones...
- Oh, shut up.

He's right.

Stormtroopers actually combine both
the function of infantry and military police. Heh.

Uh-huh. I'm normally very nice,
but you shut up too.

So, what are you in for?

Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas
and say thank you.

Growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.

I never really fit in anywhere
till I discovered the worlds he created...

...and finally found a place where I belong.

But why are you here?

Oh, I hopped a fence...

...and they caught me in the sculpture gallery
making out with a Chewbacca statue.

Excuse me.

Leonard.

They have a sculpture gallery.

I talked to my supervisor
and we're gonna let you go with a warning.

But if you come back,
we'll call the police and press charges.

We understand. Thank you so much.

- Uh, what about me?
- You're not going anywhere, kissy face.

Let's go. I have to take your picture,
post it at the guard gate.

Uh, one question about that picture:
Can it be with George Lucas?

Ooh. Grumpy, you are.

Okay, this is the match that decides it all.

First to 11 wins.

Serve switches every five points.
And just so you know, when this started...

...I was going to put the TARDIS
in a discreet corner...

...but now it's going
right in the middle of the living room...

...on a rotating platform
with a sign that says "Suck it." Game on.

Except Raj is gonna win.

Isn't that right, Raj?

Yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.

Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.

Okay.

I'm gonna own you, bitch.

- Raj.
- Hey.

That's not nice.

Let's just play.

One-zero. Two.

Three. Four.

Five-nothing.

Ha, ha. Wait, did you play badminton
or sadminton?

Don't listen to him. All she's got is a serve.
Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.

Wha...? And that's not offensive?
Where's the line?

It's in your purse. Play.

BERNADETTE:
One-five.

Two-five. Three-five.

Four-five.

Five-five.

Six. Seven.

Eight. Nine.

Ten-five.

Six.

Seven.

Eight. Nine.

Ten-ten.

That was an exciting 40 seconds.

It was, and now the serve is back to you
and the game is over.

You know, Amy, I can't help but wonder...

...how Sheldon would react
if the TARDIS was at your place.

- Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.
- Keep talking.

If this doesn't get him into your bedroom,
nothing will.

- Are you still mad at me?
- Yes.

We missed our lecture...

...we were almost arrested,
and you got me locked in a room...

...with a man who forced his tongue
down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

Boy, some people are just glass half-empty.

The glass is empty, Sheldon.
It's completely empty.

If you gave that glass to a man who was dying
of thirst, he would be dead. You know why?

Before I answer, was he a smoker?

I think you're looking at this all wrong.

Fine, then tell me
how I should be looking at it.

Well, not only did we go
to Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

And no one we know can say that.

And for all the times you find me irritating...

...today you got to watch someone
shoot me with a Taser.

That part was pretty good.

See?

You did flop around a lot.

I'll take your word for it,
I was too busy trying not to defecate.

You know, when they were escorting us
to the detaining room...

...I looked through a door
and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case...

...with the Ark of the Covenant. Ha, ha.

That's amazing.

And I saw Jabba the Hutt
riding on a motorcycle.

Although that was right after the Tasing,
so who can say for sure.

I guess this could count as an adventure.

It was.

And even though we're not allowed back there,
they can never take today away from us.

Unlike my sense of smell,
which hasn't returned since the Tasing.

No, I got nothing.

Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail.

Quick, we need to reset the time circuits.

Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.

I really should have thought this through.

[English - US - SDH]

- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

Settle this. Those little animated pictures
on the Internet. Are they called gifs or "jifs"?

Well, the G stands for "graphic,"
so that's a hard G, so I'd say gif.

- The guy who invented it says it's "jif."
- I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the "juy"?

Well, I'll give you three guesses
why I'm so irritated.

Something happened different
from the way you wanted it.

I guess news travels fast.

It's true. A select group of scientists
was invited to a weekend symposium...

...at a former home of Richard Feynman,
and I wasn't included.

Oh. Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because
they don't think you're an elite scientist.

Yeah, I bet you anything
it's just because you're a pain in the ass.

You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

You can spend the rest of the day
being bitter...

Agreed.

I was gonna say "or," but why bother?

- Hey, Raj.
- Hey. I got you a little gift.

Wow, that's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.

You know me. I'm from India.
I can't resist children begging.

- How's it going with the title to the house?
- Great. It's done.

The lawyer tracked down my father,
got him to sign it over.

I didn't have to meet him, didn't have
to talk to him. I don't even know where he is.

- Wow. So you're not curious at all?
- Nope.

Huh. What if he's in prison?

What if he's a spy?
What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

I'm just saying,
if he's got your nose and haircut...

...he'd make a killer Ringo.

- Thanks for agreeing to do this.
- It's cool. I've never been on a podcast before.

Well, you picked a good one to start.
Wil's had lots of great guests.

Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn,
Gates McFadden.

- Those are <i>Star Trek</i> people.
- Yes.

I only figured that out
because I'd never heard of any of them. Heh.

I deserved that.
I invited you on my show and I drove here.

Sorry.

Okay, so this is basically
just like a little talk show.

We're gonna take some calls, talk about
what it was like on the set of <i>Serial Ape-ist 2.</i>

- It should be really fun.
- This is exciting.

Yeah. So how many people listen?

Most people download it later,
but usually a few thousand listen live.

What? A few thousand people listen
to you talk about nerd stuff?

Again, right in the ears,
straight to the feelings.

Can you please pass the salt?

Sure. Not like I was invited
to Richard Feynman's house...

...and have anything better to do.

- Is this how the rest of the night's gonna be?
- I don't know the future.

Do you think there's a chance
that an asteroid could hit the Earth...

...destroying Feynman's house
and everyone in it?

No, Sheldon.

Well, then, buckle up.
You're in for a cranky night.

According to the codicil
of the relationship agreement...

...which you insisted upon, we're not allowed
to pout or be moody on date night.

You know I just put that in
because of uterus stuff.

Well, it applies to you too.

I was afraid you might bring this up...

...so I have a work-around.

There you go.

As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.

Though I admit I'm smiling a little
at the moment...

...because this loophole is so brilliant.

So, Bernadette, have you thought about
how you're going to redecorate this place?

You know, I'm thinking,
ripping up the carpets...

...maybe lose the wallpaper,
all new light fixtures.

You know, if you knocked out this wall,
it would give you an open floor plan.

And then...
It's a little scary but could be fun.

...indoor fire pit.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?
No one's knocking anything down.

Okay, okay.

When he's at Comic-Con,
I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.

- Can I help you?
- Hi, are you Howard Wolowitz?

Yes.

Um, this is a little weird.
A lawyer was trying to contact my father...

...because his name was still on the title
for this house.

Well... Who's your father?

Sam Wolowitz.

Oh.

- Sam Wolowitz is my father.
- I know.

Well, wait. So if we have the same father...

I mean, are you saying
you're my half-brother?

I think so.

Bernadette,
weird things are happening out here.

I think I started to suspect
it was a bad movie...

...when I looked at the script
and saw the title...

<i>...Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.</i>

Spoiler alert: After the monkey sees, it kills.

Psst.

I've just been handed a note.
I'm going to read it.

"Wil, do you want more Diet Coke?

Also, we have juice."

I didn't wanna interrupt.

That voice you just heard belongs to Leonard,
Penny's fiancÃ©.

- Why don't you grab headphones and join us?
- Really?

WIL: Yeah.
- That'd be great.

All right, so while Leonard gets set up,
let's take a call.

Hello, caller. You are on with Penny and Wil
from <i>Serial Ape-ist 2.</i>

WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: <i>I don't have a question.</i>
<i>I just wanna say I'm a big fan of the movie.</i>

<i>I've seen it like 10 times.</i>

Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time,
but the other nine are on you.

Thanks, caller. You know the movie
actually has a little bit of a cult following?

- Really?
- Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention...

...and I saw a woman dressed
as your half-ape character.

Oh, if she was with an Indian guy
dressed like a banana...

...that was just my friends Howard and Raj.

It's time for a very special guest caller.

A friend of mine you probably know
as the director of such movies as <i>Clerks...</i>

...or from podcasts and books where he often
reminds you he's the guy who directed <i>Clerks.</i>

Hello, Kevin Smith.

KEVIN SMITH [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Hey, man, yo. Is everything okay, Wil?</i>

<i>Because it's been like two minutes</i>
<i>and you haven't even brought up</i> Stand by Me.

- Hey, Kevin, it's really exciting to talk to you.
- Yeah, it really is.

<i>Oh, you guys are very sweet.
So, Penny, listen. I saw your movie.</i>

Oh, wow, I wish it was better.

Oh, don't worry about it.
Have you seen some of Kevin's films?

<i>You're cruising for a beating, Wheaton.</i>

<i>Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny.
And I thought you were, like, really great in it.</i>

- Aw.
- You know, I'm in the movie too.

<i>Yeah, whatever. Penny...</i>

<i>Penny, how come you're not in more stuff?
I'd cast you in a minute.</i>

- Seriously?
<i>- Oh, yeah, man.</i>

<i>I'm actually in preproduction
on a movie right now...</i>

<i>...way different than anything</i>
<i>I've ever done before. It's called</i> Clerks 3.

<i>- You should come over and read for a part.</i>
- Oh, my... I would love that.

- You have a new job.
- Well, maybe I could do both.

I don't think you can do both.

I don't think I asked you.

<i>Yeah, you tell him, Penny.</i>

Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

Do you think there comes a point in life when
it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?

Probably not.

It's an evolutionary advantage
to be included in group activities.

You know what?
I used to be a fan of evolution...

...but I've since evolved,
and now I think it's dumb.

Being left out is a terrible feeling.
No one understands that better than I do.

Hey, look at that.

Even in your example,
you're all by yourself.

When there was a lice epidemic at my school,
everybody got it except me.

I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar
in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.

I can just picture them all right now
at Feynman's house.

Probably discussing SchrÃ¶dinger...

...and at the same time,
not discussing SchrÃ¶dinger.

See? They're missing out
on hilarious jokes like that.

And at the same time, not.

Reminds me of when my stupid brother and
sister would build forts in the living room...

...and wouldn't let me in.
I hated that so much.

You know, there's nothing I can do
about getting you invited to the symposium.

But if you wanted...

...we could build a fort.

Isn't that a little juvenile?

More juvenile than this?

I'll get the blankets,
you Google how to have childlike fun.

You know, I'm being a bad host.
Let me get some more coffee.

- Oh, let me do it, Howard.
- No, I got it.

So, Josh, what do you do?

I'm studying oceanography
down in San Diego.

Oh, how nice.

I love <i>Finding Nemo.</i>

Enough chitchat. How do we know
you are who you say you are?

- Why would I lie?
- Okay, you got me there.

- You here looking for money?
- No.

Kidney? Cornea? Piece of his liver?

No.

You're in a Beatles cover band...

...and you need Howard
to replace your dad as Ringo.

- Why don't you help with the coffee?
- Okay, but something smells fishy.

And not just because
you work around sea animals.

That actually sounds interesting,
and I'd like to learn more about it.

- Hey, you okay?
- Not really.

This guy shows up out of the blue,
and now I have a brother?

My father has another family?

I get it. What do you wanna do?

I don't know, I...
I'd just like him to go away.

I can't deal with this.

All right, I got your back.

Thank you. Come on.

I'd like to point out,
this wall just provided a lot of privacy.

I can't believe my brother's an astronaut.
That's amazing. What was it like?

- Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the...
- Hey. The young man asked a good question.

So for those of you just tuning in...

...we are listening to a really fun fight
between my co-star...

We're not fighting.
We're just having a conversation.

All right. We're listening
to a really fun conversation...

...between my co-star from <i>Serial Ape-ist 2</i>
and her fiancÃ©...

...who doesn't believe
women should have dreams.

Give me back that juice.

- What is the harm if I audition?
- Well, what if you get it?

I don't know, I make a movie,
we could become rich and famous...

...win an Oscar, Golden Globe,
and live an incredibly wonderful life.

From a Kevin Smith movie?

KEVIN SMITH [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Oh, I'm hanging up now.</i>

Don't listen to him. You're awesome.
You're one of the greatest directors of our time.

<i>I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.</i>

And that was Kevin Smith.

- Thanks a lot.
- I'm just trying to protect you.

How many times did I see you get your heart
broken trying to make it as an actress?

Instead of protecting me, try being excited
when something good happens.

I'm always excited for you.

I'm excited that you found this new job
where you're making decent money.

- Decent? I make twice what you make.
- Wait, twice?

Yeah.

Like, times two? Twice?

For those at home, Leonard just found out his
fiancÃ©e makes way more money than he does.

Let's listen.

I went to school for half my life.
I have a doctorate.

I'm still paying off college loans.

Well, how much do you owe?
Maybe I can help you out.

Wil, I'm... Can we just turn off the podcast
for a little bit?

For those of you at home,
I am shaking my head no.

How's it going, Sheldon?

Wonderful.

I just finished hanging the lights.

- Can I come in?
- Yes. Oh, but enter through the side.

Batman is a load-bearing blanket.

- Amazing.
- I know.

This isn't the printout. This is my real face.

What are we doing? This is a fort.
Let's sit on the floor.

Roughing it? Okay.

Everything looks so big from down here.

This must be how Leonard feels.

I'm surprised you could hear me
with this Thin Mint in your ear! Ha, ha!

- Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

Anyway, I should probably get going.

Howie, have you noticed how often
people say that when you start to do magic?

Sorry. I have a long drive.

Well, I hope I get to see you again.

I hope so too. I've always dreamed
of having a brother to play catch with.

Aw. Keep dreaming.

Hey, I threw the first pitch
at an Angels game.

- Wow.
- He did it with a robot.

You had sex with a robot?

- That's not what she meant.
- But technically, yes.

Hang on. If you're making all this money,
where is it?

- In a safe place.
- What does that mean? Under your bed?

No. It means a diversified portfolio
of stocks and bonds.

I'm not overly conservative. I'm young.
So my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

- Wait a minute. You have a guy?
- Don't you have a guy?

Why would I have a guy?
I don't have any money.

Oh, sweetie,
you should really get some money.

For those of you listening at home,
how great is this?

Wil, I'm begging you,
just please turn that off.

Sure.

And we're back.

Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

So our roles changed a bit
over the last couple years.

This is the way life is.
And I'm sure in time they'll change again.

Great. You're not only
more successful than me...

...now you're more mature.

Okay, look. Would it make you feel better
if I did something dumb...

...like sneak out of work one day
to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?

That would be great. Thank you.

I'm just gonna jump in here real quick.
Leonard, a moment ago you were dead set...

...against Penny resuming her acting career,
but now you're all for it.

Is it fair to say
that she played you like a violin?

Yes, it is, Wil.

So I have to ask.

Was the robot sexy?

It was actually just a mechanical hand.

Because that's all you need, right?

You are my brother.

Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual
Best Fort Ever Contest or fort-off...

...are Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga,
Fort Sumter...

...and Fort Cozy McBlanket.

I'd say Knox over Ticonderoga,
because it's got the gold...

- Mm-hm.
- ...and McBlanket over Sumter...

...because it has a higher thread count.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Oh.

Ten o'clock.

- Date night's over.
- No. We haven't picked a winner.

We both know this one's gonna win.

Well, of course we do.

Fort Knox doesn't have
a secret physics lending library.

- Come on. I'll help you take this down.
- Wait. What if, just this once...

...we suspend the date-night parameters
and you stay later?

Well, as long as we're suspending
the parameters...

...I could stay really late,
and we could have our first sleepover.

- That's a big step.
- It's a big fort.

Very well.

I will agree to a family-friendly,
G-rated boy-girl sleepover.

PG. Some scenes may be too intense
for younger viewers.

G-rated with a warning
for families with babies and toddlers.

You got yourself a sleepover.

Do you need to borrow a toothbrush
or pajamas?

Would it alarm you to know
that I hid those things here two years ago...

...just in case this ever came up?

It would, but you know how much
I admire preparedness.

How did you know
we'd be in the living room?

Who says this is the only one I hid?

Hello? What is this?

We built a fort.

Are those my sheets?

Yes, they are.

Okay, well, you kids have fun.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

Leonard, don't you wanna see
the inside of the fort?

- No, I'm good.
- Oh, come on.

I really wanna tell someone
they can't come in.

Okay, fine.
Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?

I wanna say no, but it's too glorious.
Get in here.

LEONARD: Thank you.
AMY: Have a seat on the floor.

SHELDON:
Not there. That's my spot.

[English - US - SDH]

Would you like to hear some songs
I've rewritten...

...to get children interested
in the hard sciences?

- Sure.
- Really?

Yeah, well, I like music. I like science.
I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.

[SINGING]
<i>There was a scientist who had a theory</i>

<i>And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o</i>

<i>J-A-M-E-S</i>

<i>C-L-E-R-K</i>

<i>Space M-A-X-W-E-L-L</i>

<i>And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o</i>

<i>There was a scientist who had a theory
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o</i>

<i>A-M-E-S</i>

Okay, okay. We get it.

Perhaps you'd prefer this one.

[SINGING]
<i>The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all</i>

<i>Because it has eight legs
And two body parts</i>

- That's pretty cool, Sheldon.
- Thank you.

Do either of you know BeyoncÃ©?
I'd love her to get behind it.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You know the new Discovery class missions
NASA's been working on?

- Yeah.
- They're looking to include a message...

...from Earth in case one of them
is encountered by alien life.

When I encountered alien life, I discovered
that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.

You can't breathe our air
without an inhaler...

...he's allergic to Earth nuts,
but I'm the alien.

Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists
that have been asked...

...to submit a design proposal
for the message and its delivery system.

- Excellent.
- Congratulations.

And I was wondering if any of you guys
would like to help me do it.

Are you kidding? Yes.

- What did you have in mind?
- I'll tell you what you should do.

Avoid the presumption
of the Terran sensory input paradigm.

Absolutely. You need a device capable
of delivering info...

...across a wide range
of perceptual modalities.

Any intelligent organism
would at the very least...

...need the ability to locate
the position of objects in space.

So the ideal interstellar lingua franca
would be haptic.

How about a 3D tactile communicator
rigged for cross-sensory transposition?

Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing
their ideas on me, and only one gentleman...

...who bothered to ask me
what my thoughts were. You two are out.

Congratulations, Leonard.
You're on the team.

My mommy raised a gentleman.

- Hey, thanks for coming by.
- Yeah, I'm excited to help.

I would've included the others,
but you know exactly what would've happened.

They would've taken over the project
and bossed us around.

I get it. Just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't
let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts...

...because he said
it was a theoretical nut conflict.

You should've told him
to mind his own business.

That's better than what I did say,
which was, "Fine, I'll eat them with club soda."

What makes them think
they're always in charge of everything?

- They're alpha males.
- Huh.

- What does that make us?
- We could be betas, they're second in charge.

- Okay, sounds good.
- Or we could be omegas.

They get pushed around by the alphas
and the betas.

Okay, that sounds like us.

Whatever. There's no alphas here,
and this is your project.

You're in charge.
How do you wanna start?

I don't know. How do you wanna start?

I don't know.

Should we call Sheldon and Howard?

- No, we can do this by ourselves.
- Okay, great. How do you wanna start?

I don't know. How do you wanna start?

Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.

I bet that started off as a joke...

...but by the third one you realized there was
something strangely enjoyable about it.

Yeah, I kind of wanna do it again.

I don't recommend it.
You'll be doing it the rest of your life.

If you're looking for Leonard,
he's with Koothrappali.

- No, I actually came to talk to you.
- How nice.

Here are some topics that interest me:
quantum mechanics, trains, flags...

No, no, it's about my acting career.

Oh, I'm sorry, that's not on the list.

- Well...
- Oh, wait.

How about we split the difference...

...and discuss why Austria was an archduchy
and not just a regular duchy?

Okay, here's the thing.
I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great...

...but I have an audition for a movie,
and if I get it, it could screw everything up.

Mm. I know exactly what you should do.

Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.

Well, why?

I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf.

Earlier today, it was pointed out to me
that I tend to force my ideas on people.

You're really not gonna tell me?

No, that train has left the station.

Now, we can play this one of two ways.

You can say, "Trains? Tell me more."

Or you can just look at me like that
and I'll start.

What's going on in here?

I am making molecular cocktails.

This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan. Heh.

Oh, how do you drink it?

Just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.

I think I'll have a beer.

- First, take a picture with me.
- Why?

Well, Raj and I always talked about learning
how to make cocktails like this together.

So I taught myself...

...and I'm putting this on Instagram
so he can see it and feel like a turd.

Say, "Cheese."

Is this about the probe
he's working on without you?

You betcha. The very one.

Howard, you're a grown man.
You guys don't have to do everything together.

I know...
That's why I'm spending tonight with you.

Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

With my honeybunch.

- You're being childish.
- No. He is.

So I have a dominant personality.
We all know that.

I'm sorry, what do we know?

In social groupings,
I just naturally wind up in charge.

Don't take this the wrong way, but how many
of these little booze balls have you had?

- You don't think I'm a leader?
- I was kidding. Of course, you are.

Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.

You'd better not change
because I love who you are.

Will you need help cleaning all this up when
you're done, or can you do it all by yourself?

All by myself.

There's my big boss man.

So often, on the front of the locomotive...

...is a large iron wedge
for clearing objects off the tracks.

Now, while commonly known as a cow catcher,
I prefer the more accurate "cow exploder."

Okay, Sheldon, let me ask you a question.

If I was at a train station...

...and one train could take me
to my current job...

...and the other could take me
to an audition for a movie...

...which train should I get on?

Are you using trains
to trick me into giving you advice?

No.

All right, then.

You should take a third train
where you audition for the movie...

...but hold off on making a career decision
until you have more information.

Oh. You're right. I'm worried about something
that hasn't even happened yet.

Huh. You are a wise man.

Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man
or the person who comes to him for advice?

Oh, I guess you're right.
Maybe it is the person who asks.

No, it's the wise man.

That's why he's called the wise man.

Know how I know that?

I'm the wise man.

I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

Just out of curiosity, why didn't you
ask Leonard for advice about this?

Because I already know what he'll say,
"wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it."

It's just like he's here.

So we know that previous attempts
to send a message into space...

...like the Golden Record on <i>Voyager,</i>
were heavily criticized.

Aliens could only play the Golden Record
if they figured out how to build a record player.

To be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone
out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella.

- Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
- That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.

Well, my feelings were real
when he was about to die.

My God, when he's on the table
and they used the paddles on him.

And he's all white.

And they zip him up in that bag.

And Gertie can't stop crying.

And the flower dies.

- Okay, let's talk about something else.
- All right.

So it sounds like we need a way
to communicate that's simple.

And doesn't require outside machinery
to be built to access it.

It's also a problem because we don't know
if the aliens who find this can see.

They might communicate
in a totally different way than us.

Like when my dog is mad at me,
she tells me by peeing in my slippers.

That's actually a valid example.

Animals do deliver messages through scent.

Bees talk to each other by dancing,
whales have songs...

Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling
her eyes that each mean something different.

Okay, so what it sounds like is what we want
is a device that can deliver a message...

...through not only sight
but other senses as well.

The most basic sense...

...that any space-faring civilization
would have to possess is touch.

Ooh! Ooh, ooh.
We could make a video-playing device...

...that simultaneously translates
the information into a tactile medium.

All we have to do
is rig a 3D communication system.

- We can totally do that.
- I know.

- This is great.
- Know what else it is?

- What?
- Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.

Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.

[SINGING] <i>It's the eye of the tiger</i>
<i>It's the ear of the bat</i>

<i>It's the whiskers of the catfish
And the walrus</i>

Hang on.
Not that your song isn't terrible, it is.

But how do you mention bats
and leave out sonar?

You didn't let me finish.

[SINGING]
<i>And also regarding the bat</i>

<i>It has sonar</i>

- Hey.
- Hello.

Look...

...I know you guys are upset.
But we've talked about it...

...and we think it'd be beneficial
for you to be part of the project.

Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?

I'm sorry. I was trying think of what rhymes
with "nose of the aardvark."

We want you back on the project with us.

Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?

Look, we admit it, the idea
that you guys came up with was really good.

And I'd love your help.

I suppose it couldn't have been easy
for you to say.

It wasn't.

So are you in?

- Certainly.
- Sure.

Great. Now that we're all on the same page,
let's get together tonight and work on it.

Get together tonight?
Leonard, stop trying to control everything...

...and give poor Raj a chance to come up
with what we should do. Go ahead.

- I think we should do it right now.
- Tonight works better for me.

Okay.

PENNY:
<i>Okay, it's just an audition.</i>

<i>Why am I nervous?</i>

<i>Maybe it's a good thing.
It just means I want it.</i>

<i>And I can have it.</i>

<i>This feels right. Why did I ever give this up?</i>

Yeah, I'm starting to remember.

So I'd like to try a technique
where no one gets steamrolled.

When you talk,
instead of bringing up a new idea...

...respect what was just said
by building on it.

Uh, building on that,
we should order dinner.

How is that building on what he just said?

Building on what Sheldon said,
I could go for Chinese.

Hang on. Building on what Leonard said,
no one built on what I said.

Building on building on that, there's a new
build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.

- Building on that, I'm lactose intolerant.
- No, I saw the menu, they have soy cheese.

You didn't say "building on," you're out.

- It's not Simon Says.
- You're missing the point.

You're out and you're out, I win.
Who wants pizza?

Penny?

- Oh, hey.
- Hey. I haven't seen you auditioning in a while.

Yeah, I got a job
as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

- You quit acting?
- Kind of.

But now I get to act like inflamed heart
is only "a mild side effect."

I heard you can make good money
doing that.

Yeah, it's going okay,
but I do miss this sometimes.

Really?

Because I gotta tell you,
I am so sick of the humiliation...

- ...and being treated like a piece of meat.
- Chelsea?

Wish me luck.

They're gonna love you.

I heard she's pushing 40
and everything's fake.

Yeah, I started that rumor.

Since we agree on the delivery system
for the message, maybe we should talk about...

...what the message could be.

Well, I think we should show
what Earthlings look like.

The plaque they sent on the <i>Pioneer</i> probe
had a drawing of a naked man and woman.

Yeah, I never cared for that.

It's advertising to predator races
just how soft and squishy we are.

Squeeze yourself.

Oh, don't be offended.

You know of the four of us,
you have the most veal-like consistency.

Maybe there's a way to appear non-aggressive,
but also able to protect ourselves if necessary.

Like smiling and waving with one hand...

...but the other hand
holding the severed head of a tiger.

You wanna send a passive-aggressive message
into the universe? That's ridiculous.

Oh, you mean passive-aggressive
like posting pictures...

...of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan
balls that you know belong in my mouth?

Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive
like asking our group to help on your project...

...and then only choosing Leonard.

Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings...

...but you two have strong personalities
and always end up taking over.

It's not always.

What about when we went to Comic-Con
dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

You got to be Jabba's head
and I got to be his fat slug butt.

We looked great.

You let a guy sit on me.

He was dressed as Princess Leia.
It made a nice picture.

I'm just saying,
sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.

Yeah, like when you took Sheldon to Texas
and showed him all around NASA.

You didn't even think
to ask me and Leonard.

You know what? You're right.

I should've asked you.

And if he does ask you, go, it's amazing.

If we're talking about being left out of things,
you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.

Oh, I recommend that too.
That was a magical experience.

Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with
James Earl Jones and never told any of us.

I sure did. Oh, my goodness.

From Jabba's head
to ice cream with Darth Vader.

I'm having a heck of a ride.

Clearly, good things happen
when I'm in charge.

Now, why don't you boys step aside?
Let me knock this project out.

Sheldon, you're not in charge.
Raj is in charge.

Leonard, who's really in charge?

The person in charge
or those who put him in charge?

He's right.
If you think about it, we're all in charge.

No, the guy in charge is in cha...
Why's everyone so bad at these?

I mean, the whole experience reminded me
about how much I hated that world.

You know, the anxiety, the depression,
the negativity.

I don't wanna feel those things.

I wanna sell drugs to people
who feel those things.

I can't believe you got up and walked out
of an audition for a big movie.

I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part,
then stunk up the place.

But then I walked right out.

I'm glad you have a new appreciation
for your job.

I do. And I don't think I've ever thanked you
properly for helping me get it.

"Properly", "at all",
it's just words I've never heard.

Well, thank you.
You're a good friend and you changed my life.

You're welcome. Hey,
now that you're making some real money...

...maybe you could take your friend out
for a nice thank-you dinner.

- Sure.
- You probably have to invite your other friend...

...because she overheard you talking about it
and it would be awkward to exclude her.

- Okay.
- How about now?

All right.

Don't forget your wallet.

<i>Greetings from planet Earth.</i>

<i>Just turn left at Alpha Centauri,
you can't miss it.</i>

[IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]

[English - US - SDH]

It's the best one they make,
I just can't get it to work.

- I'll figure it out.
- It streams HD video...

...straight to your phone while it's flying.

Nice. Where were you when I was single?

Okay, we should leave in about an hour.
You all packed?

I need to throw in a few last-minute things.
You know, makeup, underwear, clothes.

If your bathroom floor counts
as a carry-on, you're packed.

Have you ever given a high school
commencement speech before?

No. It's pretty exciting.

Aren't you afraid of being blinded?

- How would I be blinded?
- At the end of the ceremony...

...all the students throw
those pointy hats in the air.

It's all pomp and circumstance
until someone loses an eye.

- I'll take my chances.
- Fine.

I wonder if they make
"I told you so" cards in Braille.

Look, the problem
with commencement speeches...

...is that they're boring.

Ooh. Do you own a T-shirt cannon?

Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?

I don't know, why do I own one?

It's really nice you're sharing
this experience with Penny.

Mm. I thought it'd be fun to show her
my old stomping grounds.

I even know the exact spot
where they used to stomp me.

Well, now you get to go back
as a successful scientist.

With a beautiful girl on your arm.

And a pointy hat
sticking out of your eyeball.

- How did you get ready so fast?
- Oh, I pack light.

Once, I got through an entire spring break
with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.

LEONARD: Why did you need a belt?
PENNY: It's called an evening look.

I've never been to New Jersey before.

Eh, it gets a bad rap from shows like
<i>Jersey Shore</i> and <i>Real Housewives.</i>

- So it's not really like that?
- No, it's like that.

But I am excited to show you around.

PENNY:
Think we'll have time to visit your mom?

Yes. We'll also have time
to put my junk in a garlic press...

...but I'm not doing that either.

[PHONE BEEPS]

Uh-oh.

I just got an alert.
Our flight's been canceled.

- What?
- Looks like there's a big storm...

...all up the east coast.

- Well, couldn't we get on another airline?
- I don't think so.

So that's it? We're not going?

I guess not.

- Well, that sucks.
- Yeah. I worked hard on that speech too.

- Ugh. You could tell it to me.
- Thank you, but I'm okay.

Are you sure?
I could pretend I'm a cheerleader...

...who can't control herself
around esteemed alumni.

- Greetings distinguished cheerleaders...
- Ooh!

Okay, the Wi-Fi extender is on, camera's on,
they're on the same network.

- We should be getting an image.
- All I see is a black screen.

And my own reflection.

I look sad.

- Maybe we should recalibrate it.
- All right.

Step one. Rapidly flip the calibration switch
from the fully up...

...to the fully down position
for at least 10 times.

- It actually says "at least"?
- Yeah.

Why would they say "at least"?

Is it 10 toggles?
Is it a hundred toggles, you know?

Is it a thousand toggles?
Ten thousand toggles?

- A hundred thousand toggles...?
- Sheldon.

You see where I'm going with this.

Just flip the switch until the lights
on the drone change to solid yellow.

That seems simple enough.

Initiating calibration sequence.

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

Well, I suppose 10
is technically "at least 10."

But they're still getting
at least one angry letter.

Now I rotate it horizontally...

...on its center axis
until the lights turn green.

Initiating rotation sequence.

Don't look at me. Initiate.

What does red and yellow mean?

It means the calibration failed.
We have to start over.

Very well.
Reinitiating calibration sequence.

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

Eleven?

It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

Mm. Hello, Daddy, what's up?

<i>Not much, just wanted
to see how my son's doing.</i>

Very well, thank you.

<i>Are you still dating that dermatologist?</i>

If you could feel how soft my skin is,
you wouldn't have to ask.

<i>Oh, and there's something else
I wanted to ask you.</i>

<i>Why did you spend a month's rent
on a toy helicopter?</i>

Oh, you're where that bill goes.

<i>I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle.
It's time you learned responsibility.</i>

<i>The only way to teach you that
is to cut off your allowance.</i>

No, Daddy, no.

There are lots of other ways
to teach me responsibility.

I know, you can give me an egg
and make me take care of it for a week.

<i>No, my mind is made up.
Starting now, you're on your own.</i>

But, Daddy, I miss my family so much...

...and with you and Mommy
getting a divorce...

...I feel sad and empty.

Buying a little toy every now and then
helps me fill that void.

So while I can't hug you every day,
flying that helicopter...

<i>I'm cutting you off.</i>

Just to be clear, financially or midsentence?

No red and yellow,
no red and yellow.

- It's green!
- Yeah! We did it!

If it's this much fun to rotate it,
imagine when we fly it.

Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically
until the lights turn off.

Oh, no!

All right, playtime's over.

Let's open this baby up.

Won't that void the warranty?

Sheldon,
I have a Master's degree in engineering.

I wipe my bottom with warranties.

Except for AppleCare,
that pays for itself in the long run.

- Hi.
- Hey, where'd you go?

- I got you a little something to cheer you up.
- Really?

Sex last night, pancakes this morning.
Am I dying?

Just open it.

Cap and gown?
Why do I need a cap and gown?

Because you are giving
your commencement speech.

- What are you talking about?
- I called your school...

...and convinced them to let you
give your speech over Skype.

Really? That's amazing.

And you gave me the robes to give it in.
Thank you.

Yeah, now about those.
They came from a costume shop...

...and all they had left
was "Sexy Graduate," so they...

This might be a little short.

- Short and sexy. That's my wheelhouse.
- Yeah.

Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.

- You know what they all do, right?
- Yes, of course.

- What about this one?
- Well...

How familiar are you with miniaturized,
integrated logic circuits?

- Not very.
- That's a miniaturized, integrated logic circuit.

So can you get it working?

I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

I built components for the space station.

I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work?

It worked fine, it just wasn't
designed for Russian cosmonauts...

...and their potato-based diet.

- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

I have to return the helicopter. My father...
What did you do?

Don't worry. He went to MIT.

He can solve any problem.

As long as it doesn't originate
in a Russian man's colon.

- I don't freaking believe this!
- Relax. It'll be fine.

No, you have to put this back together
right now so I can return it.

You can't return it, Howard wiped
his bottom with the warranty.

What?

I think metaphorically...

...but he was in the bathroom for a while.

Howard, my father cut me off.

- I have to get my money back for this.
- Calm down.

Okay. Okay, you're right.

It's time for me to step up
and take responsibility for my life.

Be a man.

Hello, Mommy?

Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.

Well, I've been thinking about you.

How are you doing?
Are you happy, Mommy?

Such a sweet boy for asking.

Can't believe you come
from the poison seed of your father.

Well, I like to think I take mostly after you.

Anyway, speaking of Daddy,
I had a very strange conversation with him.

He said he couldn't
to send me money anymore...

...because of his active social life.

What does that mean, "active social life"?

Well, let's not talk about him or whatever
shenanigans he may or may not be up to.

Let's talk about you.

Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?

All I know, Mommy,
is that he's a single, wealthy doctor...

...and now, for some reason,
there's no money for your little boy.

Well, however much money
your father was giving you...

- ...I'll give you more.
- Thank you, Mommy, I love you.

Helicopters for everybody.

What's taking so long?

- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Just let me see.

Sweetie, you know you're supposed
to wear clothes under the graduation gown.

A, surprised you know that.

B, I wanted to look
like a sexy graduate for you.

- Well, you do.
- Oh, thank you.

You're gonna be on Skype.
They're not gonna see your legs.

I'm gonna go put on pants just in case.
But I have to say, this is very freeing.

Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.

Ooh. Done and done.

Okay, I think I've narrowed it down
to a faulty pin...

...on the on board communication chip.

Very impressive.

You know, when you're done with that...

...can you look at this?

It doesn't make smoke anymore.

One toy at a time.

Sorry. Yeah, maybe it's for the best.

I hear locomotive smoke
is the second leading cause...

...of death among train aficionados.

- What's the first one?
- Suicide.

Wrong, obesity.

- I have the tools you wanted.
- Thank you.

You guys don't have to go to the trouble.

I'm back in the money,
I can buy another helicopter.

It's not about the money.

It's about solving a problem.
It's why I became an engineer.

It's what I like to do,
it's what I'm trained to do, it's who I am.

Well, look at you.
The little engineer that could.

Why don't you just call tech support?

- Hey!
- Not cool!

- What?
- There's two kinds of people in this world.

Those who call tech support...

...and those who make fun of the people
who call tech support.

I call tech support.

- You call tech support.
- What a baby.

And now for our commencement address.

One of our most distinguished alumni...

...noted Caltech physicist,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

<i>Members of the faculty, students...</i>

<i>...I'm excited to speak to you today.</i>

<i>I can't help but remember the last time
I was in this auditorium.</i>

<i>Two guys from the lacrosse team
played keep away with my asthma inhaler.</i>

<i>But enough about my 10-year reunion.</i>

I'd also like to take a moment
to thank my beautiful fiancÃ©e...

...for helping to make this speech possible,
even though weather nearly prevented it.

<i>Oh, hello. Hi. I didn't know
he was gonna point it at me, so...</i>

<i>Don't do drugs and stay in school.</i>

- They're graduating.
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>

All right, power is reconnected.
I think we're back in business.

Let's just run a few tests
before we take it outside.

- Sheldon, we got Wi-Fi?
- Check.

- GPS?
- Check.

- Battery charged?
- Check.

Four hours of our lives gone? Check.

All right, all systems go in five...

Four, three, two, one.

That's what my train used to do.

Ready to call tech support?

Give me the number.

Probably wind up
talking to some foreign guy...

...who's reading from
the same manual I have.

[PHONE RINGING]

It's my father, you jerks.

- Hello, Daddy.
- What did you say to your mother?

Nothing, I was just calling to check in,
make sure she's doing okay.

Well, after talking to you,
she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy.

Really? I don't know where
she'd get an idea like that.

You know Mommy
and her crazy imagination.

I'm so lucky I take after you.

- You think you take after me?
- Well, I try to.

I certainly wouldn't be a scientist
if you hadn't been my role model.

Who wants to go to Vegas
in a real helicopter?

<i>It was L. Frank Baum who said:</i>

<i>"No thief, however skillful...</i>

<i>...can rob one of knowledge...</i>

...and that is why knowledge
is the best and safest treasure..."

Wow, I'm boring myself.

Sorry, I can't see any
of your faces right now...

...but I bet they look like this...

Uh, heh. You know,
I wrote an entire speech...

...to say how high school prepares you...

...and what a wonderful place it is...

...but I hated it.

Maybe high school's great
if you look like this...

But I didn't even feel like I existed
at that school.

<i>And now that I think about it...</i>

<i>...I bet a lot of you feel the same way.</i>

<i>So for the remainder of my speech...</i>

<i>...this is for the invisible kids.</i>

<i>Uh, maybe you never fit in...</i>

<i>...or maybe you're
the smallest kid in school...</i>

<i>...or the heaviest or the weirdest.</i>

<i>Maybe you're graduating
and still haven't had your first kiss...</i>

<i>By the way, 19...</i>

<i>...and Geraldine Coco,
wherever you are, thank you.</i>

<i>...maybe you don't have any friends.</i>

<i>And guess what. That's okay.</i>

While all the popular kids are off doing...

I don't know what they were doing,
I wasn't there...

I'll tell you later.

<i>My point is...</i>

<i>...while you're spending time on your own...</i>

<i>...building computers
or practicing your cello...</i>

<i>...what you're really doing
is becoming interesting.</i>

<i>And when people finally do notice you...</i>

<i>...they're gonna find someone
a lot cooler than they thought.</i>

<i>And for those of you who were popular
in high school, it's over. Sorry.</i>

<i>Thank you. Congratulations.</i>

What happened to me?

When did I become an old man...

...baffled by modern technology?

Next thing you know, I'll be hitching
my pants up to my armpits...

...and complaining about the awful music
the kids are listening to.

It is awful, isn't it?

Listen to that noise.

Hang on, hang on. It's working! I did it!

- How'd you do that?
- No idea, but I did it!

- Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.
- I'm not flying it!

- Then who is?
- I don't know.

Must be getting a Wi-Fi signal
from somewhere else.

Initiate landing sequence!
Initiate landing sequence!

Aah!

Hey, the camera's working!

Oh look, it's me. Aah!

<i>Tech support, can I help you?</i>

Yes, it's a robot uprising.

Call the police!

- So you really think they liked it?
- Ah, sweetie, it was the best speech I...

Aah! God!

Don't worry. Everyone in here is safe.

[English - US - SDH]

Leonard, what time
does your mom get in?

- I don't know. Tomorrow morning?
- Don't you want to know for sure?

As soon as she flies
into California airspace...

...I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.

It's so nice both of your moms are
coming in to see you guys get an award.

Well, my mother's been there
for every honor I've won...

...since I beat out my twin sister
for the "Did It On The Potty" trophy.

- How does this look?
- Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.

Sure, his mom gets roses.

When I want them they're a
"bouquet of severed plant genitals."

You act like I didn't get you
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.

He's right, roses die,
but a moist, rotting log...

...will pump out mushrooms
for two or three magical years.

Your mom's never been thrilled
with our relationship.

Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.

If you could run out and get a PhD,
that might make her like you.

- Really? It didn't work for you.
LEONARD: Mm-hm.

- Think the moms will get along?
- They're pretty different.

Maybe they'll be best friends.

One of them is brilliant.
One is sweet and simple.

Sound familiar?

Shelly, I'm so proud of you
and Leonard for getting this award.

- Thank you, Mother.
- I tried to read your paper...

...but it was very hard for me to understand.

It's quite straight-forward, actually.

It describes a new model of
the universe that conceptualizes it...

...as the surface of
an n-dimensional superfluid.

Interesting. You can believe that...

...but God filling an Ark with
animals two-by-two is nonsense.

What did they feed the lions, Mother?

The floating bodies
of drowned sinners, of course.

Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned
psychiatrist and woman of science.

Can you please keep the Bible babble
to yourself while she's here?

- Are you ashamed of me?
- Of course not, I love you.

I'm just embarrassed by
the things you believe, do and say.

Well, I love you too.

My little bowl of lion chow.

So have you and Penny
set a wedding date?

No, we're kind of taking it slow.

I see.

What does that mean?

You've been on and off
with this woman for seven years...

...and engaged for one year.
One has to wonder if there's a problem.

Are you having satisfactory intercourse?

Yes, Mother.

BEVERLY:
Only satisfactory, I see.

I change my answer. It's amazing, it's hot.

We can barely keep
our hands off each other.

Seems odd to try and impress
your mother with your sexual prowess.

But then you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

See, this right here, what you're doing...

...can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?

BEVERLY:
Why, are you attracted to her too?

Of course not. She's just
a very sweet and God-fearing lady...

...and you have to be
respectful of her beliefs.

Leonard, I'm an adult,
I know how to conduct myself...

...around people
from different walks of life.

- Thank you.
- Where is she from again?

- East Texas.
- Ugh.

Hey, look who's here.

Dr. Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.

Likewise. I read your paper,
it was very impressive.

- Thank you.
- We just spent two hours in traffic.

Did you think to mention to me
that you liked our paper?

Of course I did. But it's a mother's job
to make sure her child's self-esteem...

...is not dependent on anyone's approval.

That's so sweet,
you think I have self-esteem.

Dr. Hofstadter, I want you to
meet my mother, Mary.

- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

- How was your flight?
- Very pleasant. And yours?

Lovely. Almost as if someone...
Not saying who.

...was watching over the plane.

You're kidding, right?

Subtle, Mom. Real subtle.

- Stuart...
- Morning.

We talked about this.

I don't mind you living here,
but we gotta have rules.

And rule number one is pants.

Hey.

You must be very proud of your son.

Oh, yes. He recently argued
a case before the Supreme Court.

He did?

Oh, you mean this son.

Sure, he's terrific.

Beverly, would you like
to see the math I worked out...

...to support our hypothesis?

You mean my hypothesis.
I hypothesized it all by myself.

Calm down, dear.

Mary, I'm curious,
when did you first realize...

...that your son had
such a remarkable mind?

Oh, good question.

Everyone loves stories
about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

Well, I have to say when he was 13...

...and tried to build
a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.

Oh, this is a good one.

First thing you have to know
about Shelly is, since he was little...

...he was always concerned
with the well-being of others.

And he didn't think that it was fair
for people to pay for electricity...

...so he was gonna power
the entire town for free.

Tell her about the uranium!

Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable.

When he arranged to
get some yellow cake from Chad...

...I thought he was talking about
Twinkies from one of his friends.

But I wasn't because
I didn't have any friends.

[LAUGHS]

It turns out that this little scallywag
was trying to use my Visa card...

...to buy uranium from an African warlord...

...in the country of Chad.

Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.

Oh, he was a handful.

I was a handful.

You still are.

Mom, tell Mary the story...

...about how I made
a Van de Graaff generator...

...out of our vacuum cleaner.

All right.
He broke the vacuum cleaner.

[GUNFIRE AND SWORD SWOOSHING
ON TV]

For a while, everything was vampires...

...now it's all zombies.

I wonder what the next monster fad will be.

We haven't had
a good invisible man in a while.

Clearly you've never seen me
try to talk to a woman.

Guys, in the time you've been
sitting here playing video games...

...I got the car washed,
picked up supplies and went to the bank.

I put on pants.

Kiss ass.

Okay, I don't know
when I became the mother...

...to three lazy teenagers,
but it stops today.

You guys are cleaning
the kitchen, top to bottom.

Hey, I don't even live here.

Yes or no, do you have clothes
in my laundry now?

I do.

And some of it is wool,
so dry flat if possible.

Here's a picture of me receiving
my Bachelor of Science degree.

You don't look very happy.

Well, I had just begun puberty...

It was figuratively and literally
one of the hairiest moments of my life.

Shelly does not like change.

True, but all the clenching in the world...

...will not keep testicles in your abdomen.

Hey, sorry, I got caught up at work.

- Hi, Beverly.
- Hello.

Oh, okay.

Sorry, I forgot.

- You remember my mother.
- Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.

MARY:
Good to see you again, dear.

That's what I'm talking about.

So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny
since we got engaged.

- Here, let me show you the ring.
- Oh.

Lovely. Must've been very expensive.

Oh, no. Not at all.
We found a place online...

...that repurposes diamond drill bits.

We did not, that's not true.

Can I speak to you alone for a second?

Oh, sure.

It came from Tiffany's.

- You mean the box, right?
- Keep walking.

It really doesn't matter to me
how much he spent on the ring.

I think.

Did I misspeak about the ring?

Yes, and we'll get back to that.

Even with your mother here...

...you're deliberately hogging
all the attention from my mom.

You're like those elephant seal pups...

...that steals the milk from two mothers.

Do you mean what marine biologists
refer to as super weaning?

Yes, you are a super weaner!

Well, now I have to correct you.

As a bit of an elephant seal buff...

...the more accurate comparison
would be when two mother seals...

...actively seek to nourish the same pup.

So I believe the term you're looking for...

...is a "double mother suckler."

You're right.
That is the term I'm looking for.

You are a dirty double mother suckler.

Okay. Now that we have
the terminology straightened out...

...how dare you?

Not in a rush.
We'll set a date when the time's right.

It doesn't matter, sweetie.

The moment a man lays with a woman,
they are married in the eyes of the Lord.

BEVERLY:
Ugh.

"Ugh"? The Bible is "ugh" to you?

No, I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

As a psychiatrist, I know how important
people's superstitions can be to them.

You wanna talk about superstitions?
Sheldon sent me the books you wrote.

All that nonsense
about super-egos and ids.

What bull dropped that on the barn floor?

His name is Sigmund Freud.

Hey, look at that.
You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.

Stay out of this.
PENNY: Mm-hm.

At least the bearded man that I believe in
preaches love and compassion.

All yours talks about is
why you hold in your poop...

...and wanna crawl back inside your mama.

It's fascinating. How can someone
as enlightened as Sheldon...

...come from someone like you?

I know the answer, you're not gonna like it.

- Try me.
- When I was pregnant with Shelly...

...I was driving to church,
and I was praying to the Lord...

...to give me a son
smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.

And I looked over
and I saw a Jesus bobblehead...

...in the Subaru next to me nodding "Yes."

What is that supposed to mean?

It means I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

Well, do it some more.

Maybe you can knock
some sense into yourself.

How about we all stop hitting ourselves...

...and talk about
something safe like shoes...

...or how cute little Chinese babies are.

It's not my fault your mother
likes me better than she likes you!

Don't flatter yourself! She likes
everybody better than she likes me!

How old is this Jell-O?

Well, it's carrots, so I'm gonna say very.

Sorry we have to do this.

Bernadette's not wrong.
She does work hard around here.

Yeah, maybe it's a good thing
if she stops babying you so much.

She doesn't baby me.

I saw her pull you home in a wagon.

For your information, I twisted my ankle
chasing the ice cream truck.

Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you
the same way your mother used to...

...and that was not a healthy relationship.

You're right, it's time for me...

...to act like an adult in this marriage.

Starting with my husbandly duty...

...of taking out the trash.

Bernie, I made a mess!

I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.

It's all right, she'll forgive you.

She has to or she goes to hell.

I can't help but notice
how her unconditional love for you...

...is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.

Well, you doled out affection
as a reward for achievement...

...a proven way to
raise a child or train a rat.

But look how well you turned out.

I'd feign modesty at this point,
but who would believe me?

Still, you need to consider how successful
Leonard's brother and sister are.

I suppose.

While my brother and sister
are mouth-breathing idiots.

Do you suppose
you would've flourished more...

...in a reward-based environment?

Perhaps. But my mom made me
spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs...

...whenever I wanted, so who cares?

Not once did my mother
ever give me any love or affection...

...for just being myself.
I always had to earn it.

Oh, Leonard, I'm sure
she loves you very much.

In her own cold, godless way.

Yeah, and you certainly
don't have to earn my love.

- Thank you.
- Of course, you already knew that...

...when you bought me this
princess-cut drill bit.

- That's not what it is.
- I know, I know.

[PENNY IMITATES DRILL WHIRRING]

When your mom gets back,
I need to apologize...

...for the way I spoke to her.

Come on, she did kind of start it.

A good Christian would've
turned the other cheek.

On the other hand,
a good Texan would've shot her, so...

I kind of split the difference.

Hey, who's in the mood
for spaghetti and hot dogs?

- Oh, me!
- Yeah, me too!

Coming up.

I don't really feel I deserve it.

That was a big sticky mess...

- ...but I think I got it.
- Looks good.

Look at that,
you cleaned it up all by yourself.

Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.

Honestly, I don't know why you complain...

Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

Just leave.

I'm so glad you and I
were able to bury the hatchet.

Me too. And I respect
your right to your beliefs.

And I will pray for you.

Okay. Mom, let's get you
back to your hotel...

...before anyone says anything else.

One moment, there's something
I need to say to you.

Oh, really? That's too bad.

Leonard, I always
made you earn my affection...

...but today I realized that there's
more than one way to raise a child.

I taught her that.

Therefore I would like to
initiate a new protocol...

...wherein I shower you...

...with unconditional love.

Wow. When does that start?

So needy.

Come to Mommy.

It's okay. Go ahead.

Oh, my son.

Oh, my mother.

Oh, my God.

[English - US - SDH]

Can you believe it's been five years
since our first date?

I know.

Do you think I should start
watching <i>The Flash</i> TV show?

That's what you're thinking about?

Well, one of the things.

Are any of them me?

Yes.

I thought, "I can't decide
if I should watch <i>The Flash</i> TV show.

I know. I'll ask Amy."

Anyway...

What are you doing?

You're right. You did kind of kill the mood.

I didn't kill anything.

You did, talking about your TV stupid show.

Excuse me.

Starting to watch a television show that might
run for years isn't a decision to take lightly.

I'm wrestling with a big
commitment issue here.

Really?

That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

Sheldon, do you understand the irony...

...of your fixation
on a man with super speed...

...while after five years
all I can get out of you...

...is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

Irony's not really my strong suit.

But I have been getting better with sarcasm
if you want to give that a try.

Oh, sure, I'd love to.

Whenever you're ready.

I don't want to rush you,
but I'm closing early tonight.

Ooh. Hot date?

No, I overheard Bernadette tell Howard
she's making him a meatloaf...

...and you don't have to not ask me twice.

If I stick a lightbulb on this...

...wouldn't it make a great lamp
for my bedroom?

You're kidding, right?

Oh, is this freaking you out?

Well, I guess I'm just more of a...

...Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel kind of guy.

Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.

All right, never mind.

No, hey, you should totally get it.

- In fact, I'll buy it for you.
- Sold.

- Raj, you don't have to do that.
- Too late, no returns.

That was really intense.

Now we know. Next time we go
to the farmer's market...

...the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

- Hey.
- Oh, good, you're here. I need your assistance.

Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid
on a goat bite?

What happened?

Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

Been there.

- So, what do you need help with?
- Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.

Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

- Yes.
- That's probably it.

What'd you say to her?

I just asked her if I should start
watching the new <i>Flash</i> TV series.

- And that made her angry?
- Baffling, right?

We were necking like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

I stopped so I could ask the question.

Next thing I know, goodbye,
kissy face, hello, yell-y face.

Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,
she expects the attention to be on her.

It was. I asked her if she thought
I should watch <i>The Flash.</i>

Yeah, I'm tapping out. Leonard?

I guess your main concern
is the time commitment...

...of watching an entire season
of a show.

Oh, no, not just a season.

If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,
even if the quality declines.

I get it. <i>Smallville</i> almost wrecked you.

Yeah.

Exactly. You know, I waited 10 years...

...to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.

What's wrong with you two? He was talking
about television during their date.

Oh, not just date night.
Our fifth anniversary.

That's even dumber than you wondering
if being bitten by a goat...

...would give you the powers of a goat.

If that happens, don't make me wait 10 years
to watch you eat a tin can.

Have you guys noticed Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

Because she has weird tattoos?

No, because she wants to have sex
with me in a graveyard.

One more time?

She and I were supposed to watch
the new <i>Avengers</i> movie tonight.

It was sold out. I said, "What else
do you want to do?" She said:

"Let's go to a cemetery
and do it on somebody's grave."

Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

What difference does it make?

Well, if it's her father's grave
and they didn't get along...

...then you know she holds a grudge.

The only issue is that
everybody has their own thing.

As long as it's two consenting adults,
I don't see the harm.

What if it's one consenting adult
and one who pretends to consent...

...because he's afraid of being alone?

Well, then I guess bring a blanket.
The grass gets damp at night.

I don't know, guys.
Maybe this relationship isn't for me.

Maybe I should break up with her.

Heh. Right. You're gonna break up with a girl
who has sex with you. You believe this guy?

I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

- How are you saying that with a straight face?
- I don't know.

[BOTH LAUGH]

You guys are being jerks.

Buddy, other than Jenny Craig...

...you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

You're one to talk.

Complaining about Stuart living here
the past year.

- Don't see you showing him the door.
- Not the same. Emily's a person.

Stuart's more like an infestation.
Something you spray for.

Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid
of hurting someone's feelings as I am.

That's not true.
We were just laughing right in your face.

- Thanks for cooking.
- My pleasure.

- That carrot was delicious.
- Yeah.

I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of them.

Still haven't heard from her?

No, and I'm confused.

It's been nearly 24 hours.

Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

I don't think she's wrong
about you going too slow in the relationship.

Too slow?

Yeah, you haven't even slept together.

That's right. It's called foreplay.

And I could make the case that you two
aren't moving forward in your relationship.

Uh, hello?

Hello.

No, Sheldon, we're getting married.

You've been engaged for over a year.
You don't even have a wedding date.

Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.

Okay.

We're gonna set a date.

Okay, if you say so.

- Things are good right now.
- Really good.

- Focusing on my job.
- Been busy with our paper.

- Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.
- Yeah.

Okay.

- You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.
- Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.

Did you eat all my yogurt?

The one that makes ladies do the thing
ladies pretend they don't even though they do?

You know which yogurt I mean.

I didn't touch it. Must've been Stuart.

Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it's time
we tell him he needs to move.

We should've done it months ago.

I know, but his store was reopening...

...and then there were the holidays,
and then he was sick.

Yeah, right. Sick.

Look, he didn't have jaundice.
He just looks like that.

All right, tonight's the night.

Agreed. When he gets home,
I'm dropping the hammer.

I like when you take charge.

I'm not taking charge.
You're the hammer.

So why haven't we picked a date?

- You know why.
- Of course I know why. But just for fun, why?

Not in a rush, busy with work...

- Things are good right now.
- Really good.

- You still want to get married, right?
- Oh, my God, yes. Why would you even ask?

Don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

- You want a date, pick a date.
- It's not just the date.

We haven't talked
about anything.

Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor.

Outdoor? Ugh.

I can RSVP no right now.

Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?

- Is your dad paying?
- I doubt it.

Okay, two friends each.

- All right, I want it in a church.
- Fine. I want black tie.

- Fine. I want to release butterflies.
- Seriously? Airborne worms?

Okay, well, then it's settled. Small indoor
church wedding, black tie, no butterflies.

- Sounds perfect.
- Great.

Still didn't pick a date.

- Stay out of it.
- Shut up.

EMILY: It's a beautiful night.
- Oh, yes.

We've got the moon
and the trees and...

...Elizabeth McNulty, who...

...apparently died
when she was the same age I am.

Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

So does enjoying a meal
at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.

You aren't scared, are you?

Of ghosts, no.

Of you, a little bit.

I'm sorry I've upset you.

- I shouldn't have asked so many questions.
- No, it's okay.

Yeah, maybe it's good
you got us talking about this stuff.

Well, look at that.

Even when I'm causing problems,
I make the world a better place.

Hey. Next, why don't we tackle
your penchant for whining...

...and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?

Sheldon, I think we're good for now.

Very well. So does this mean
you'll finally pick a wedding date?

Ugh. Here we go again.

Why is everyone so concerned
with us setting a date?

We're committed to each other. We're happy.
A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.

So you're never getting married?

It's his whining, isn't it?

Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.

Look, all she's saying is, we are in love.

It doesn't matter
if we get married tomorrow...

...or a year from now or 50 years from now.

Ew. Fifty? We'll be old and gross.

Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.

My aunt and uncle were married 63 years.

Towards the end
it was like watching cheese melt.

Um, I'm free tonight.

Are you saying you wanna get married?

Vegas isn't that far away.

- I'm in. Let's do it.
- Eee-ah.

After all these years.

- I'm really happy for the two of you.
- Thank you.

Now get out of my spot.

Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

So remember, the key is to be firm.

- Show no weakness.
- Right.

Good luck.

Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.

I never should have told you
my middle name.

STUART: Hey, guys.
- Hey.

You got a minute?

Sure. Let me just
put this stuff in the fridge.

I felt bad finishing your yogurt.
I bought more.

Howard, your favorite fruit
is in season.

Crunch Berries.

- Don't let that sway you.
- It's hard not to.

They taste so much better
than real berries.

What's up?

So we need to talk.

You okay?

I think we should talk.

Is everything okay?

- Well, you've been living here a while now.
- I know.

I may sell comic books at work,
but the real superheroes...

...are sitting right in front of me.

Yeah.

His middle name is David. Go.

Look, I care about you a lot...

...but we are very different people.

Are you breaking up with me?

No, no, I'm just pointing out
that you're dark on the inside...

...and I'm dark on the outside.

So anyway, what I'm trying to say is...

[PHONE RINGING]

- You need to take that?
- It's my dad.

Probably calling to wish me
a happy birthday.

I'll call him back.

You were saying?

Look, Raj, be honest with me.

If you want to end things, do it.
Don't expect me to do it for you.

End things? I'm trying
to tell you that I love you.

HOWARD & BERNADETTE [SINGING]:
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas
you can actually get married in.

Doesn't sound very romantic.

- Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
- Heh, heh.

- I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.
- Yeah. Ahem.

- This is crazy.
- I know.

You think people are gonna be mad?

Maybe. But this isn't
about them, it's about us.

It is.

It is about us.

And you know what the best part is?
We took our time.

We met.
We were friends for a couple years.

Then we got together.
Then we got untogether.

Then we worked out all our problems,
and now we know everything about each other.

We can just go forward
with no surprises and no regrets.

Right. No surprises.

And no regrets.

Well, there is...

...one thing...

- ...I feel I should tell you.
- What?

You know, so we can go into this
with no secrets between us.

What?

Remember a couple years back...

...when I was on that research ship
in the North Sea?

- Yeah?
- Okay, well, there was a lot of...

...drinking and craziness going on.

- You told me.
- Okay. Um...

Well, there was this girl.

- What did you do?
- Nothing.

Really, it was just kissing.

- And then what?
- And then nothing.

I stopped it.

But...

...it still bothers me, and...

...I wanted you to know.

[SIGHS]

All right.

- Did you ever do anything like this...?
- Nope. Never.

LEONARD:
That's too bad.

- Can I ask you a question?
- Hm.

Why are you telling me this now?

Like I said,
we're about to get married...

...and I want a clean slate. No secrets.

Really? To me, it seems like
we're about to get married...

...and you're trying to sabotage it.

- Would you rather I didn't tell you?
- No, I don't want secrets between us.

Now I'm confused.
What am I supposed to do?

Keep your mouth off other women.

I can do that.

From now on, this mouth...

...you and food. That's it.

[PENNY SIGHS]

Okay.

Yeah?

Look, I'm not happy this happened...

...but I think I can get past it.
We weren't engaged at the time, and it...

- ...was just kissing.
- Right.

Just kissing.

It wasn't even very good.
She was a smoker.

- I'd just been seasick...
- Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.

So...

...we're still getting married?

Yes.

Because we love each other.

Yes.

And it's the happiest day of our lives.

Don't push it.

[PHONE LINE RINGING]

<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello.

Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about relationships...

...and how difficult they can be.

- And I think...
<i>- I've been thinking about them too, Sheldon.</i>

<i>Being your girlfriend is so challenging.</i>

<i>Emotionally.</i>

<i>Physically.</i>

<i>I've been incredibly patient for years.</i>

Strongly disagree. Go on.

<i>Okay, well...</i>

<i>...this isn't easy to say, because...</i>

...I <i>love you, but...</i>

<i>...I need some time...</i>

...to <i>take a step back</i>

Well, Gollum...

...you're an expert on rings.

What do I do with this one?

[English - US - SDH]

HOWARD: <i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

Well, there was this girl.

- What did you do?
- Nothing!

Really, it was just kissing.

(SIGHS)

- All right.
- So we're still getting married?

Yes.

Because we love each other.

Yes.

And it's the happiest day of our lives.

(LAUGHS) Don't push it.

<i>I need some time</i>

<i>to take a step back and
re-evaluate our situation.</i>

Oh.

<i>Bye, Sheldon.</i>

Well, Gollum...

You're an expert on rings.

What do I do with this one?

So what package are you thinking?

Mmm, this one comes
with music and flowers.

Oh, they even stream the whole thing
live on the Internet.

Why would we want that?

'Cause there's a lot of
gorgeous blondes out there

who don't believe they can land
a short, nearsighted scientist.

Let's give them hope.

Whatever, put us on the Internet.

I always wanted a wedding
with a comments section.

Hey, if you're not into this,
we can do it another time.

No.

No, I want to. Look, we've put this off
long enough. Let's do it.

Aw! It's exactly what you said
the first time we slept together.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, excuse me.

It's Sheldon. Hey.

- Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
- No, why?

- Good, don't do it!
- Why not?

Some important new information
has come to light.

Women are the worst.

I thought it was paper cuts,
but I was wrong.

No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.

What happened now?

Amy has ended our relationship.

- Oh, no. Seriously?
- What's going on?

Amy broke up with Sheldon.

She did?

Is Penny crying?

- No.
- No, of course not.

They thrive on our suffering.

Buddy, I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

Yes. If I ever talk about
going out with a girl again,

roll your eyes at me like I do to you
when you say dumb things.

Sheldon, okay. Just because
you're going through this with Amy

doesn't mean all women are bad.

Whatever.

Hey, I just heard about you
and Sheldon, are you okay?

Not really, can you come over?

Uh, actually, I'm in Vegas.
Leonard and I are about to get married.

Hold on. You're getting married
and you didn't invite me?

Well, it was kind of
a spur of the moment thing.

Wow.

Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.

Amy, don't be like that.

Why did I just hear Amy's name?

Penny's on the phone with her.

Did she say anything about me?
Never mind, I don't care.

Well, if you care,
you can find out and tell me.

Just don't be shocked
when you find out I don't care.

Okay, will you relax?
You're not missing anything special.

Hey.

She's upset.
Look, it's gonna be a great wedding.

Look at you in your little suit.

Amy's upset? Is it about me?

No, I think it's because we're eloping.

Your marriage is causing her pain?
Yeah, great, I take it back.

Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

- Hello.
- Oh!

What are you doing here?

When last we spoke,
you said you needed time.

Well, it's only been 11 hours.

<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy
was nearly 11 hours.

I made you watch that,
you said it was an eternity.

Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk,
I'll let you know.

Very well.

You seem to be headed somewhere.

May I walk with you?

Sure.

Boy am I glad we're going out again.

We're not back together.

Why? Well, is there someone else?

Just couldn't wait to put that first notch
on your bedpost, could you?

If you must know, I'm going to Howard
and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.

And who's this guy you're taking?

There's no guy!

Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?
That's sad.

I'm not gonna be alone,
I'll be with my friends.

Your friends.
Well, I think you mean my friends.

And why wasn't I invited to this?

Maybe because the two of us being there
would make them feel awkward.

We make everyone feel awkward.
That's our thing!

They're running a little behind.
Should be pretty soon.

Okay.

Hey, if you're hungry there's a breakfast
buffet at the strip club next door.

Thanks, but I don't like glitter
on my scrambled eggs.

I don't think the strippers
prepare the meal, but okay.

Look, it's not how I pictured it, either,
but I'm still glad we're doing it.

- Me, too.
- You sure?

- Yes.
- And you promise you're okay

with everything from the car?

Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?

You're right. I'm sorry.

We have the rest of our lives to dredge up
stuff from the past and fight about it.

So what do you think?
Should we run next door and grab a bite?

Well, what if they call our names?

Don't worry, they gave me
this vibrating coaster.

Oh, and the fairytale continues.

- Thank you for doing this.
- Our pleasure.

You feeling okay?

We were together for so long,
I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.

Well, that's understandable.
You forgot. It's called "happy".

- Howard.
- I'm not saying anything bad.

Just that she was in love with her captor
and somehow managed to escape

from his dark and crazy dungeon.

I know what you're going through,
my last breakup was pretty tough.

Oh. What was her name?

Hey, it's a true story.
I don't need the third degree!

(GASPS)

For God's sake.
Sheldon, what are you doing?

I didn't want to come in. I was told
it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.

So I'll just stay out here and pretend
that I don't have to go to the bathroom.

- Howard, do something.
- I'm on it.

Sheldon, you being here
might not be making things better.

I see. And is that why
everybody was invited but me?

They didn't invite everybody but you.

Bernadette invited me
and Stuart lives here.

Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?

So, when you hear the music,
that's your cue. Any questions?

The package we paid for said the aisle was
supposed to be strewn with rose petals?

- Where are the rose petals?
- WOMAN: <i>We're out.</i>

You know what, it's fine.

WOMAN: <i>We can use the potpourri
from the bathroom.</i>

Okay.

- Really, we're good.
- Yep, just wanna get married.

- Yeah.
- Great, I'll see you two up there.

- This is it.
- I know.

I love you.

I love you, too.

WOMAN: <i>Was that a yes or no
on the potpourri?</i>

- No thank you.
- We're good.

Raj, you're probably wondering why

Amy and I aren't showing
any affection to one another.

Didn't even crack the top ten.

Well, you should know
she recently broke up with me.

I said I needed time to think.

I'm sure you guys
will figure something out.

You hear that? Raj is devastated.

Sheldon, shh, the wedding's starting.

I see what's happening. Sides are forming.

Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team,
I pick Howard.

- I'm not taking sides.
- Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.

- Really?
- At least you got picked.

Before I go any further, have either
of you prepared your own vows?

LEONARD: Yes.
PENNY: No.

- You wrote vows?
- Yeah.

I don't have any,
you're kind of making me look bad.

It's okay, I don't have to say them.

No, go ahead. I'll come up with
something mushy, you'll cry. We got this.

Penny.

"We are made of particles
that have existed

"since the moment the universe began.

"I like to think those atoms traveled

"14 billion years through time
and space to create us

"so that we could be together
and make each other whole."

Wow.

Penny?

Right, um, okay.

Leonard. Um...

You're not only the love of my life,
I mean, you're my best friend.

And...

(RECITING "YOU'VE GOT A
FRIEND IN ME" FROM <i>TOY STORY</i>)

Is that the song from <i>Toy Story?</i>

- He loves that movie.
- (VOICE BREAKING) I do.

- Aw, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.

- I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.
- No, we totally won.

You know what, Amy? I don't understand.

Are we broken up or not?
It's like you can't make up your mind.

It's because you're not giving me
any space to think.

Well, you should think fast because
men can sire offspring their entire lives,

but those eggs you're toting around
have a sell-by date.

You know what, Sheldon.
You've made this really easy.

You're immature, you're selfish.
You just insulted me to my face.

I don't need any more time to think.
We're broken up.

Amy.

MINISTER: (ON TV)
<i>...take this man to be your husband?</i>

- Will someone take me home?
- Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.

MINISTER: (ON TV)
<i>...symbolizes your eternal love.</i>

<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

<i>- We did it!
- I'm so glad you guys could watch.</i>

We'll say it was beautiful
in the comments section.

Hang on.

I believe I'm supposed to carry you
across the threshold.

Can you?

Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed
when he falls asleep in front of the TV?

Okay, let's do it.

(LEONARD GRUNTS)

- You gonna make it?
- I'm okay.

Nicely done.

Thank you.

Finally there's a Mrs. Hofstadter
who isn't disappointed in me.

- Oh, the night is still young.
- (CHUCKLES)

Everything all right?

Yeah, I guess.

Just tell me.

It's just, when we were kissing,

I couldn't help
but picture you with that other girl.

Oh, no, no. Come on.

I have a friend in you, you said so.

You're right. Just forget it.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Okay, listen.

If you're imagining that
it was sexy, it wasn't.

We were both drunk,
and she smelled like an ashtray.

The boat was moving a lot
so I chipped her tooth.

Did you feel guilty?

No, she had dental insurance.

Did you feel guilty after kissing her?

Yes, I felt guilty as soon as it happened.
I feel guilty every time I see her.

What do you mean every time you see her?

What

do I mean? Boy, that's a toughy.

- You still see her?
- Well--

No, not socially.
But you know, just at work.

- You work with her?
- (SIGHS)

- How could you not tell me that?
- I wanted to tell you in the car,

- but you told me to stop talking!
- Okay, so you're saying this is my fault?

No, of course not. Okay, look.

Instead of fighting, why don't we
dim the lights, get naked and make a baby?

I was trying to lighten the mood.

It's not easy, you try it.

- Hello, Mother.
- Shelly, how's my baby doing?

I just wanted to let you know you can
remove Amy from your nightly prayers.

Unless you're open to praying for
a beehive to fall on her head.

Oh, what's going on?

- She broke up with me.
- Oh, Shelly.

I'll be okay, but I think that I'd like
to send the ring back to you.

Well, let's not be hasty.
Are you sure it's over for good?

It's over for me. I'm done with women.

Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.
They both hurt you on purpose.

You wanna tell me what happened?

Are you going to say
it's all part of God's plan?

- Good chance.
- Then no thank you.

Well, honey, don't send it back yet.

Your sister's married, and I'm not letting
your brother give my grandmother's ring

to that whore he's dating.

Wasn't Mary Magdalene
a woman of ill repute?

When your idiot brother redeems mankind

he can date whoever he wants.

I know it hurts now,
but it's gonna get better.

Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.

You've got so much to offer.

Thank you.

Any man would be lucky to have you.

That's true.

I just hope I did the right thing.

I'm sure you did.

Maybe that's the problem.
You always do the right thing.

Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing?

Like you're doing right now?

Exactly.

I asked you over and over
if you were okay.

Why would you go through with
the wedding if you weren't?

I thought I was okay,
but it turns out I'm not!

Okay, listen.
I may not have been entirely faithful,

but you, you are not easy to lift.

Wow!

Well, marriage must agree with you.
You are just glowing.

I'm not glowing, I'm upset.

Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.

SHELDON: <i>Knock, knock, knock, Penny.</i>

<i>Knock, knock, knock, Penny.
Knock, knock, knock, Penny.</i>

What's this?

Leonard told me what happened.

So I took it upon myself
to make you a hot beverage.

- Oh, that's so sweet of you.
- Yeah, I know.

But turns out being sweet isn't enough
to keep a girl these days.

I blame Madonna.

I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.

I'm sorry about Leonard.

I thought I raised him better than that.

You know, it's bad enough what happened,

but then he tried to hide the fact that

he sees her all the time
at the university.

He does? Who is it?

Ugh. Some girl named Mandy.

- Mandy Chow?
- Yeah.

Oh, you don't need to worry about her.

She's brilliant and attractive.
She can do way better than Leonard.

That's great. (CLEARS THROAT)

(STAMMERING) Wait a minute,
I know this may sound far-fetched,

but I'm on the market now.

You know, if I dated Mandy, that would
teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.

That's ridiculous.

Oh, you're right.
I could never be with a woman

whose self-esteem was so low
she'd be with Leonard.

I'm with Leonard.

Yeah, I know. Forever.

(SIGHS)

Who would have believed
these things would happen to us?

Right? (SCOFFS)

You know, I can't believe
Amy actually went through with it.

Hang on.

You knew that she was
going to end it with me?

Did you try and stop her?

Well, I told her to be true to herself
and do what makes her happy.

Do what makes her happy?

She plays the harp and her car is
paid for. How much happier can she be?

Okay. Look, it's not my fault that
she thought you were a bad boyfriend.

I see.

Well...

I think I'll be going.

- Sheldon.
- No, no, no. We are done here.

(PENNY SIGHS)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Would you mind opening the door and
then angrily slamming it behind me?

- Sure.
- Thank you.

And slam it hard
because I am pretty steamed.

All right, Leonard, hang in there.
Talk to you tomorrow.

What happened? They just got married.

I don't know, it's a mess.
They had a huge fight in Vegas.

Think they'll break up?

I don't know, sounds pretty bad.

Penny's back in her apartment
all by herself.

Really?

Would you like to hear another reason
why men are better than women?

Sure, let's make it an even hundred.

You would never kiss me and make me
say I love you and then break up with me.

I wouldn't.

Yeah, and you know why?
Because you're a man.

The champagne of genders.

Well, I may be a man, but I think
I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.

All you hear women say is,
"I'll just have a salad," you know.

"Where's my lip gloss?"

"I think this element
should be called radium."

That last one was Madame Curie.

I figured that out.

You know what?
She was kind of an honorary man.

She had a penis made of science.

I can't believe I'm spending
my wedding night with you.

Really?

I never imagined it any other way.

English - SDH

Why are you up?

How am I supposed to sleep?

I've been married less than 24 hours
and my wife isn't speaking to me.

Perhaps you could think of this
in a more positive light.

In one day, you've managed to do

what it takes many couples
decades to achieve.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

- Hi.
- Hey.

You couldn't sleep either?

Of course not.

Me neither.
But I just had a tickle in my throat.

Not profound marital problems.

- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

Please tell me how I can fix it.

I'm glad you asked.

As I see it, there's a simple solution.

Your lips had a dalliance
with the lips of another woman.

It seems only logical that
to restore balance to the relationship,

you should find another man
and dally with him.

And by dally, I mean some hardcore
mouth-on-mouth action.

Okay, that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

I actually think he's onto something.

What? You can't be serious.

Just 'cause I messed up
and made out with a girl,

you're gonna do the same
with a random guy?

I'm currently single.

That's true. You are.

What is happening?

I will tell you what is happening.

I am saving my best friend's marriage.

(GASPS)

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

(VIDEO CALL RINGING)

<i>Sheldon, I don't think you understand
how being broken up works.</i>

<i>The only way I can sort
through my feelings</i>

<i>is if there is space between us.</i>

<i>Every time I see you,
it re-traumatizes me.</i>

<i>I go through the pain all over again.</i>

Well, hello to you, too.

<i>What do you want?</i>

I understand we're no longer a couple,

but I would like to remind you
that we made a baby together.

<i>What baby?</i>

A precocious little Internet show
known as <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

Yeah, great.
See you in about half an hour.

<i>Sheldon, I am not doing</i>
Fun With Flags <i>with you.</i>

- Why not?
<i>- Because we're broken up.</i>

Sonny and Cher made it work.

Their variety show kept going
long after the divorce,

and here we are still talking about them.

<i>No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.</i>

You must be thinking
about Donny and Marie,

'cause you and I are clearly
talking about Sonny and Cher.

<i>Sheldon, this has to stop.</i>

<i>I know it's hard. It's hard for me, too.</i>

<i>But I've seen and talked to you more
in the two days we've been broken up</i>

<i>than in the last two months
that we were together.</i>

Well, if you wanna see less of me,
maybe we should go out again.

Can't believe you made out
with Mandy Chow.

Oh, trust me, I wish it never happened.

And you knew about this this whole time?

- I did.
- And you didn't think to tell me?

Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.

Let's leave Leonard out of this
for the moment.

This is about you and me.

How is my day-old marriage falling apart
becoming about you two?

Hang on. What do I need to do
to make you trust me?

You think it's hard having one wife,
try having two.

You know, I bet you told Bernadette

all about how he was screwing around
with Mandy Chow.

We didn't screw around.
We just got drunk and made out.

Whatever. It would've been nice
to hear it from you.

What are you doing here?

I am here to return your belongings.
That's what people who've broken up do.

And you didn't do your compulsive
knocking ritual so I would open the door.

On the contrary, you no longer get
to enjoy my charming eccentricities.

We're not friends with benefits.

- Just give me the box.
- Yeah, wait, wait.

Don't you wanna go through it
to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?

Fine.

My old scarf.

Yeah. You wore it the night
we went ice skating. Remember?

You mean the night that I went ice skating

and you stood at the rail
googling the symptoms of hypothermia.

We made one heck of a team, huh?

Whose bra is this?

It's not yours?

Oh, my!

Well, how embarrassing for both of us.

- It's Penny's.
- Hey, you broke up with me.

It is none of your business
whose naked bosom

I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.

Goodbye.

Amy. Amy. Amy.

(SIGHS)

Tables work, too. Good to know.

Ooh, brownies for girls' night.

Hands off, I'm mad at you.

Look, I know it's a lot of money,

but the guy at the store said in
five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.

What will pay for itself?

Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?

I'm mad at you for blabbing to me
what Leonard did on the North Sea

and I'm mad that I've had to hide this
from Penny for two years.

And you have every right
to be mad about those things. So...

Why don't you let me handle
the credit card bill this month, huh?

I mean, don't even look at it.

I mean, if Penny finds out I've known
all this time and haven't told her,

she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend.

I wish you never told me.

And I wish Leonard never told me.
He's the bad guy here!

I guess that's true.

And you let Penny marry him. (SCOFFS)

Compared to that, who cares

if I bought a George Clooney
limited edition manscaping kit?

Hi, I'm calling about
your marriage counseling services

and was curious what your rate is.

Really?

Um, okay, is there any kind of discount
for length of marriage?

We're just talking hours here.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

- Hi.
- Call you back.

Hey.

Can we talk?

I would love that.

(CLEARS THROAT)

All right.

Look, I'm sorry I said I was okay
with everything before we got married.

I hate that we're going through this,
but I don't know what to do.

If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon,
we can try marriage counseling.

- Hello.
- Hey, buddy, can we have some privacy?

Oh, of course. Wouldn't want to intrude.

- So--
- This is yours.

Okay. When I'm done with him,
I'm gonna need more information.

Yeah. It's nothing odd.
I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.

Okay, look, I might be overreacting,

but how am I supposed
to get past this when I know tomorrow

you're gonna go to work
and see this woman?

Now, forgive me for eavesdropping,

but as I see it,
there's a simple solution.

Wake up, wake up, wake up!

Bring Penny to meet Mandy.

What? Why?

Well, right now
Penny's imagination's running wild,

but if they meet, that will eliminate
the mystery and alleviate her fears.

Like when that Sparkletts guy
let me look under his eye patch.

First of all, you made that guy cry.

And we learned that you don't need
an eyeball to do that.

Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible
idea than Penny meeting Mandy.

Really? Why is that?

What? You actually wanna meet her?

No, but now that you're being weird
about it, maybe I should.

Well, I'm not being weird.
Am I being weird?

Yes.

And that's coming from me.

Fine, you wanna meet her?

No, I just wanna know that when you're
at work, there's nothing going on.

How many times do I have to tell you?
I have no interest in this woman.

Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.

What, in Leonard? Even the Sparkletts guy
could see that's unlikely.

(SIGHING) I guess my big problem is
I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy

who would do something like this.

Anybody can make a mistake
in a weak moment.

(SIGHS) What do you think?

I... I don't know what to think.

But then again, I just found out about it.

You know, I fell in love with Leonard

because he wasn't anything like
the guys I was used to dating.

I mean, I knew those guys
weren't above cheating,

because that's usually how we met.

Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.

No, I wanna believe you. I really do.

Am I being naive?

I don't know.

This is all so new to me.
I'm still processing.

You know, he never would've done this
when we first met. He's cockier now.

That's because you made him
more confident.

You know, if you think about it,
without you,

he never would've grown
into the person he is now.

I mean, sure, more women might notice him,

but I think it's better to have a guy
be with you because he wants to be,

and not because he thinks
he doesn't have any other choice.

Never thought about it like that.

Me neither. Not until just now.

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
and welcome to:

(SHELDON READING)

You may notice
that I'm holding a remote control.

That's because my cameraperson
and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

has chosen to end
her relationship with me.

I'm going to pause here
to let that sink in.

Okay.

If you need to pause a little longer,
just click the pause button.

But the show must go on.

And thankfully, all of the things
my girlfriend used to do

can be taken care of with my right hand.

Anyway, let's not spend any more time
talking about her.

We're here to talk about flags.

Tonight's theme: flags of countries
that have been torn apart

and the women I have a feeling
were responsible.

You guys have any idea how much it costs
to see a marriage counselor?

$250 an hour. Why?

How do you know?

Bernadette and I have occasionally
gone to one to,

you know, stay on top of things.

And I'm just hearing about this now?

Dude, just because we're best friends

doesn't mean that I have to tell you
everything that goes on.

You don't have to, you should want to.

Oh, great. There's Mandy.

Why are marine biologists always so cute?

I don't know.

But I'd like to get lost
in her Bermuda Triangle.

It's not helpful.

Then I won't say I'd like to cover
three-quarters of her surface area.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

- Are we done?
- Not yet, this is fun.

Ooh, I know. I'd let her free my Willy.

Where are you going?

I'm gonna ask her
if she'd be willing to talk to Penny

and tell her she has nothing
to worry about.

- No, Leonard, wait.
- What?

I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.

Now we are done. (LAUGHING)

- Hey.
- Hi, Leonard. What's up?

Do you mind if I sit?

Sure.

So, um, I've been thinking a lot
about you and me and... The boat.

- What about it?
- You know,

what we did when we were drunk.

Oh, no! Did I sleep with you, too?

Nope, we just made out.

Oh! Well, good for me.

So, what can I do for you?

Uh, okay, well, I got married recently.

Oh, congratulations!

To Sheldon?

(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

Never gets old.

No, no, to a girl.

Anyway, I told her what happened
between you and me

and she's concerned about us
seeing each other at work.

It was just a kiss.
Why would you even tell her?

'Cause I didn't want there
to be any secrets between us.

Is that really the reason?

What else would it be?

I don't know. Sounds like you're trying
to sabotage the relationship.

No, I don't think so.

Although, Penny did say exactly that.

Okay. Well, that's something
to think about.

You know, on some level,
I've always believed

that I don't deserve a woman like her.

Oh, you're gonna think
about that right here?

I mean, she's really beautiful.
She can have any guy she wants.

Which is probably why it took her
so many years to tell me she loved me.

Maybe you should talk
to a therapist about this.

Too expensive.

You'd think I'd be used
to women withholding their love.

I mean, my mother did.
I mean, no matter how hard I tried,

she just didn't have any interest in me.

Imagine that.

I wonder if that's why I have such
a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon.

I had a dream the other night
that I was in a cave

and I was nursing a baby.

But the baby had Sheldon's head on it.

And your wife is worried about me?

RAJ: <i>Hey, Leonard!</i>

When you're done,
we came up with a bunch more.

<i>And then the Czech Republic says
to Slovakia,</i>

<i>"I don't think you understand
how being broken up works!"</i>

<i>Can you believe that?</i>

<i>You'd think that the Czech Republic
would try to hold on to what it had</i>

<i>given that it's not
as young as it used to be.</i>

<i>And I don't see any other countries
lining up to invade its southern borders.</i>

I'm gonna kill him.

<i>But enough about the Czech Republic.</i>

<i>Let's talk about the time Moldova made
Romania a birthday cake.</i>

<i>And Romania said it tasted good
even though it didn't.</i>

<i>And yet, Romania gets dumped.</i>

<i>I'll pause here
while you mull that one over.</i>

<i>I know, right?</i>

So? You said you had something to tell me.

Okay. Yeah. Um,

do you remember when you accused me
of trying to sabotage our wedding?

Uh-huh.

I've been thinking about it
and you might be right.

But... The good news is
that I'm pretty sure I know why.

I'm listening.

Penny, after all these years, I still
feel like maybe I don't deserve you.

Okay, that is the lamest excuse
you could've possibly come up with.

But I get it.

You do?

Yeah. You know, sometimes I worry
you're gonna wake up

and leave me for someone more like you.

I don't even understand
why you're with someone like me.

Why would I wanna be with someone like me?

You know what I mean.

And, you know, maybe the way I've been
reacting was me sabotaging this, too.

(SIGHS) Well, how about we stop
being so scared

of losing each other and just be together?

- That sounds nice.
- (SIGHS) Good.

Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

'Cause

I've loved you since the moment we met,

and I will keep loving you
until the end of time.

Oh.

Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful
thing anyone's ever said to me.

Yeah?

That's because you're beautiful,

and your beauty fills my heart
with love and song.

It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.

If you think that's cheesy, buckle up.

Penny Hofstadter,
will you please stay married to me?

Oh, damn it, you topped it.

Shall we go to the bedroom
and make this marriage official?

- Yes, please.
- Okay.

Sheldon, I can't believe
you got us a wedding gift.

I don't know why you're so surprised.
I watch movies. I see what people do.

- What is this?
- Plane tickets and hotel reservations

for a weekend away in San Francisco.

- Wow!
- That's so great!

Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf
and Alcatraz and cable cars.

We're gonna have so much fun.

(BANGING ON DOOR)

- We?
- Is there a problem?

Oh, no, no. I just, I said, "Whee!"

How dare you go on the Internet
and say mean things about me,

and compare my genitalia
to a part of Czechoslovakia?

You saw through that one, did ya?

I don't know what you were thinking,
but take the video down now!

She watched it.
I'm gonna get that girl back.

AMY: <i>I only watched it because you
e-mailed it to me with the subject line</i>

<i>"this is gonna make you mad!"</i>

She was listening through the door.
She wants me.

Hey. Wanna hear a fun fact about mustard?

Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor

were evolved by the cabbage family as
a chemical defense against caterpillars?

Yeah.

Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.

- Hey there.
- Hey, you're early.

The movie doesn't start for an hour.

Actually, we're not going to the movies.

- We are here to kidnap you.
- (CHUCKLES)

What are you talking about?

Well, you eloped and we didn't get
a chance to throw you a bachelor party,

<i>so there's a van downstairs</i>

and we're here to take you
to a surprise location for the weekend.

Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.

Where's the blindfold?
Where's the duct tape?

Where's the part where you call me
and demand ransom

and I try to keep you on the phone but
you hang up seconds before I can trace it

and then I say,
"I'm getting too old for this crud"?

When do we leave?

- Right now.
- Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.

(CHUCKLING) Wow, okay.

You're seriously going to get in a van
and let these two take you

to an unknown destination
for an entire weekend?

Oh, not just him, you're coming, too.

Oh, and how do you think
you're going to get me to do that?

Unhand me! This is ridiculous!

- I told you to put tape on his mouth.
- (SHELDON GRUNTS)

And I told you he bit me.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

It's bad enough
I'm being taken against my will.

I don't see why it has to be
in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.

Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van

that you're going to find
very interesting.

What? It runs on syphilis?

This van was owned and driven by
your personal physics hero,

Richard Feynman.

- No.
- HOWARD: Yeah.

- A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
- This was Feynman's van? That's so cool.

Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.

I bet he picked up a lot of
cute grad students in this bad boy.

Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
(GASPS)

So, are you gonna give us a clue
where we're headed?

Uh, okay. Let's see.

They've got spicy food
and there's a chance you'll get diarrhea.

India.

We can drive there.

Your house?

We are going to <i>MÃ©xico!</i>

Fun, I've never been there.

Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas.
"Me-he-co" is Spanish for Mexico.

What's wrong with Mexico?

Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that
jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.

Okay, calm down.
There's a theme to this weekend.

We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van
to stay at the vacation house

Feynman bought
with the money from his Nobel Prize.

<i>Â¡Viva la</i> Imodium! (EXCLAIMS)

Come on. Leonard's doing bachelor stuff.

You sure we can't take you
to a strip club?

No, if I wanna see a naked dancing man

I just flush the toilet
while Leonard's in the shower. (CHUCKLES)

- Hi.
- Hey.

I know we're not making a fuss, but,

in the spirit of bachelorette parties,

I made cookies
in the shape of male genitals.

You really didn't have to--
Whoa!

That is anatomic.

Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.

Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.

I had extra dough.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, that's Leonard.
He said they're about to cross the border.

I hope the boys don't get too crazy
in Mexico.

Oh, yeah, right, lock up your daughters

or Sheldon might lecture them about
the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Boy, that was a long night for me.

Uh-oh.

According to this Mexican Customs website,

visitors may not bring more than
five laser discs, 20 compact discs

or 12 VHS tapes.

We don't have any of those.

How can you be sure?

Uh, VHS was king when
Feynman drove this van.

And for all we know,
there are hidden compartments

lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.

If there was a hidden compartment,

don't you think
you'd be stuffed in it by now?

Are we all up-to-date
on our Yellow Fever inoculations?

You don't need a Yellow Fever shot
to go to Mexico.

You can never be too careful.

I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

So, Penny, how's married life?

Oh, it's good.

Just wish Leonard
would work up the courage

to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.

You guys still aren't living together?

We are, I mean, he sleeps here,

but it's only a matter of time
before Sheldon has a bad dream

and tries to climb into bed
with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.

Speaking of Sheldon,
how's single life treating you?

Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me.

I was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.

- Yes!
- Good for you!

But then I decided
I don't wanna go changing who I am

just because of some man.

- Yes.
- Good for you.

You know, it is normal to wanna change
your look after a breakup.

Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.

- Your sweater?
- Your glasses?

- Your hair?
- Your shoes?

Piercing my ears.

Oh...

You really never had that done?

My mom said pierced ears were for whores,
pirates and genies.

Okay. Well, you're a grown woman now.

I know, but Sheldon had this clause
in the relationship agreement

forbidding cosmetic surgery
unless it's to look like a Klingon.

We'll take you to the mall to get it done.

Why? I can do it right here.

- Really? You have a piercing gun?
- PENNY: <i>No.</i>

All you need is a needle and an ice cube.
I've done it like a dozen times.

- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, come on. I'll be gentle.

Let me take your ear virginity.

This party's weird.

Hey, watch your speed.
I hear Mexican police target tourists.

Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down,

we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat

and slap a sombrero on his head.

Dude, how many races
can you offend in a single breath?

I don't know.
Have you watched the Olympics with me?

Sheldon, can you believe that
we're driving in a van that was owned

by one of the greatest scientific minds
of the twentieth century?

It's like the Batmobile. (CHUCKLES)

If Batman was real.

And a physicist. And his car wasn't cool.

It is extraordinary.

Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.

Maybe between this and his beach house,
we'll be inspired to greatness.

I usually don't put too much stock
in charms and talismans,

however even I must admit feeling Richard
Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

That does get the creative juices flowing.

Hey, I have to return this van.
Keep your creative juices in your pants.

(TIRE RATTLING)

- What was that?
- I think it's a tire.

What if it's bandidos shooting at us?

What if we get kidnapped?

What if we end up in a factory

making Bart Simpson piÃ±atas
for the rest of our lives?

It's the tire.

- Leonard?
- What?

I'm getting too old for this crud.

Amy, I noticed your status still says
"in a relationship" on Facebook.

You're right. I should probably let
all of my Facebook friends know.

Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.

Did you change yours to "married" yet?

Uh, no, not yet. There's still
a few people I haven't told personally.

- Who?
- Oh, just my parents and my entire family.

(CLEARS THROAT)

- What?
- Why?

Well, I don't wanna hurt my dad.

You know, he always wanted to dance
with his daughter at her wedding.

What about your sister's wedding?

They started to but then her water broke.
(SCOFFS)

You know, if he finds out we eloped,
that's gonna break his heart.

How long do you think
you can keep it from him?

Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse
the longer you wait?

Well, not necessarily.
You know, Dad's not getting any younger.

So if I wait long enough,

I'll just tell him he walked me
down the aisle and it was magical.

When did you learn how to change a tire?

Every self-respecting gentleman
should know how,

in case he comes across a damsel
in distress by the side of the road.

If I see one scorpion, I'm getting on
someone's shoulders and never coming down.

And there's your damsel.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Wow, this one's really stuck.

Are you turning it the right way?

No, I took the other four off
and when I got to this one, I thought,

"I'm in a rut, let's shake things up."

Here, let me try.

(GRUNTING)

You're right.
It doesn't turn the other way.

There you go, you're all done.

That wasn't so bad.

(GASPS) Nice.

Boy, if my mom could see me now,
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

That's a joke, right?

Actually, the joke was on her, I could
still see the TV through the slats.

I'm starting to see why you and your mom
aren't very close.

Bet she'd still tell her
if she got married.

You're not gonna let this go, are you?

Well, it's kind of sad
that they don't know.

I mean, they love Leonard.

Fine, you want me to call, I'll call.

- (SIGHS) Why am I so nervous?
- It's understandable.

Amy was afraid to tell her mom
she broke up with Sheldon.

Yeah. How did it go? Did she make you
crawl into the breaking-up drawer?

Uh, well, actually, to be honest,
I haven't told her yet.

You've been giving me a hard time

and you haven't even told
your mom about Sheldon?

I'm feeling a little dizzy
from all the blood loss.

I don't know what you're talking about.

(SIGHS)

Fine. I'm calling home, but when I'm done,
you're calling your mother.

Easy for you to say. You never had
to watch <i>60 Minutes</i> like this.

- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, slugger.

- How's my girl?
- Uh, good. Is Mom around?

Ah, she took your brother
out to celebrate.

He just got his tenth
one-month sober chip.

Yeah, she's gonna make him
a little necklace.

Okay. I'll talk to her later.

Uh, Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

(INHALES DEEPLY)
Leonard and I got married.

You did? When?

Last week.
I'm sorry, I should've told you.

It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

I feel terrible.
Please don't be too disappointed.

Are you happy?

Very. Leonard is so great.

Well, then, I'm happy for you.

Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.

Well, I understand it's hard
to tell someone something

if you think it's gonna upset 'em.

It is. You're the best dad ever.

Yeah, uh, hold that thought.

I've been sitting on a little news myself.

Well, what is it? (CHUCKLES)

Oh, you know that rototiller
I got for the tractor?

- No.
<i>- Oh, you should see it.</i>

It is a beautiful piece of machinery.

Anyway, uh...

I backed over your pet pig with it.

Moondance?

Yeah, he's not dancing anymore.

You killed my pig?

I did not kill him.
The vet took care of that.

- When?
- Oh...

Ten, 12 months ago.

You didn't tell me for a year?

Well, apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

Uh, love you, slugger. Gotta go.

Okay, Amy, your turn.

(ALL GRUNTING)

(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

What are you doing?

It's called Lamaze breathing.
It helps you push.

Great. He's pushing with his uterus.

There's gotta be
a smarter way of removing it.

Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.

Right. Archimedes once said,

"Give me a lever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

"and I shall move the world."

Of course, all we need is to find stuff
to make a lever big enough to fix this.

Exactly. I'll bet there's something
around here that could be a lever.

Let's see. A lever, a lever.

Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem
one step at a time.

First, we need to decide whether
we're calling it "leever" or "lever."

And the sooner we decide it's "leever,"
the sooner we can roll up our sleeves

and not "slehves" and get to work.

We're gonna be here "for-eever."

Thanks a lot, guys.

- What did we do?
- Before I made that call,

my pig was alive and happy
and rolling around in the mud.

Now he's illegally buried in our backyard
next to my great-grandmother.

Really? They didn't eat him?

No, he was a beloved member of the family.

The breakfast meat family?

It's not funny. You're up.
Call your mother.

Oh, maybe later.
Your pig dying made me sad.

- And a little hungry.
- Phone. Now.

Okay. Okay. Fine.

- Hi, Mom.
- Try dialing.

You saw that, huh?

Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

Oh, good. How's work?

That's nice.

I'm fine. Hey, listen.
I've been meaning to ask

how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence
never got along?

Okay. That's it, give me that.

Amy broke up with Sheldon,
she got her ears pierced

and she made us eat penis cookies.

Hang on. She wants to talk to you.

I don't think the lever's working.

What makes you say that?

There's gotta be something else
we can try.

Well, if this was <i>Star Trek,</i>
we could use a phaser to blast it off.

Oh, it's too broad of a beam.

You'd need something more precise,
like Superman's heat vision.

Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make
a big green hand that unscrews it.

Well, if you need a green hand,
why not just use the Hulk?

Oh, please. The Hulk would never get
across the border with that temper.

Guys, excuse me,
not that calling one of the Avengers

isn't a perfectly reasonable choice,
but we're scientists.

Don't you think we can figure this out
using actual science?

Yes. We could use science,
but it's your bachelor party. Lighten up.

(CLATTERING)

(TAPPING AND CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)

(SINGING)
<i>We will, we will, percussive shock you</i>

BOTH: (SINGING) <i>We will, we will,
percussive shock you</i>

<i>Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise</i>

<i>Playin' in the street
gonna be a big man some day</i>

<i>You got mud on yo' face, you big disgrace</i>

<i>Kickin' your can all over the place</i>

I have an eidetic memory,
sometimes it's a curse.

(MATCH STRIKES)

I had no idea tortilla chips
were such a good fuel source.

They're basically pure hydrocarbons
soaked in fat.

Let's hope the lug nut expands.

What if that burning food
attracts animals?

We have plenty of food for the animals.

- We do?
- Yep, six-foot wiener in a Flash t-shirt.

That's not very nice.

It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Oh, what is that awful smell?

It's burning salsa. I'm hoping the acidity
and salinity combined with electricity

will corrode the lug nut off.

What an innovative solution.

Perhaps I don't give your MIT education
enough credit.

Yeah, I saw it on <i>Mythbusters.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

(CLATTERING)

All right.

This rust combined with the aluminum

- recovered from the van is now thermite.
- (SIGHS)

Great.
Couple pinches ought to do the trick.

Is that enough to melt the lug nut?

Well, let's start small.
We can always add more.

You put up a good fight, lug nut.

But you've met your match.

(RAJ CHUCKLES)

Hey, look. The lug nut's off.

What? What are you doing back?

We got a flat
and couldn't get the tire off.

- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

Yeah, if it makes you feel any better,

I pierced Amy's ears
and her mom made her sit in my closet.

We blew up Feynman's van.

My dad killed my pig with his tractor.

I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.

You win.

English - SDH

What a wonderful day! Thank you!

Oh, we're glad you had fun.

Blue Icees and a trip
to The Container Store?

It's like I died and went to the
post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination

commonly mistaken as Heaven.

I still don't understand
why you bought that pill caddie.

You're a young man.

Age is a state of mind, Leonard.

In here, I'm 90.

- (KEYS JANGLING)
- (DOOR UNLOCKING)

Why are you taking your bins over there?

Uh, that's just where I need them.

You know, she doesn't have
a lot of closet space.

Mmm, what's wrong with your closet?

Uh...

Well, honey, you know,
now that Leonard and I are married,

it kind of makes sense
that we actually live together.

So, that's all this day was?

A plan to butter me up
before delivering bad news?

- Come on, buddy.
- No, I thought we were friends.

You asked for a sip of my Icee.

If you'd had your own straw,
I might have said yes.

Sheldon, please,
we already feel bad about this.

Yeah, you know what they don't sell
at The Container Store?

Something large enough
to contain my disappointment!

Although, if anyone did, it would be them!

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Thank you for letting me
come speak with you.

Of course.

As my relationships with Penny
and Amy are currently strained,

I'm turning to you
for female comfort and encouragement.

Aww.

I'm honored.

I tried reaching out to my mother,
but she was in Bible study.

Leonard's mother is on a book tour,
my Meemaw was taking a nap,

and after a while,
Siri started repeating her answers.

So I'm your seventh choice.

Yeah, I know. Top 10, pretty exciting.

How can I help you?

In addition to Amy leaving me,
Leonard's moving in with Penny.

It's difficult not to feel abandoned.

Well, why don't you
look at this as an opportunity?

You had other roommates before Leonard.

Maybe this is a chance
to find someone new.

Hmm, perhaps I could find
someone better than Leonard.

You know, someone I could rub in his face.

Chris Pratt's all the rage right now.

I wonder how he'd feel
about taking the smaller bedroom.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You know who'd be the perfect roommate?

Gandalf, but he's a smoker.

Stuart! He's been living with us
for a while now.

I'm sure he'd love
to get us out of his hair.

Nope, couldn't be happier.

- Well, Sheldon's looking for a roommate--
- Nope.

- He'll think about it.
- STUART: <i>No, I won't!</i>

(DOOR CLOSES)

Have you seen this <i>Archie</i> comic?

It's actually <i>Archie versus Predator.</i>

How could Archie defeat Predator?

I don't know,
maybe Jughead's a Terminator.

- Hey.
- Hey, Stuart.

- Do you guys know any musicians?
- Why?

I was thinking it might be cool to have
live music here a few nights a week.

You know, give this place
more of a "staying in business" vibe.

What kind of music are you thinking of?

I like all kinds of music,
but my favorite genre is free.

Hey, we've always
talked about playing together.

Well, it could be fun
to try a little acoustic thing.

Oh, we could play filk music!

What's that?

It's been around for years.

It's like folk music,
but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.

I like it.

It sounds exactly like something
I shouldn't be expected to pay for.

Hey, dude, if we do this,
we're gonna need a cool band name.

You know, I've actually (CHUCKLES)
had one I've been sitting on for years.

- Really?
- It was for this power trio

I tried to put together in junior high,
but I was short two friends.

What is it?

Footprints on the Moon.

I just got chills.

So did I.

Me, too.

But I might have Lyme disease.

Just a few more signatures
and we'll be finished.

Uh, initial here to acknowledge
that you've returned your key.

Okay.

Oh, yes, as my future neighbor,
I'd like you to have a key.

Initial here
to acknowledge you received it.

I'm proud of you.
You're taking this really well.

Oh, it's not like I'm never going
to see you two again.

Yeah, which brings us
to article 23, subsection C.

"Please check here to reserve your spot
at the 10-year roommate reunion."

Do I really have to do that now?

No, but if you want chicken
and get stuck with the fish,

that's on you.

All right.

Oh, and lastly,

please initial here to confirm
that ownership of the living room couch

is hereby transferred to me
in perpetuity all throughout the universe.

And all alternate universes.

Except for those universes
where owning a couch

is forbidden by the hive queen.

In which case,
all glory to the hive queen.

All right, so all that's left is
for us to sign and date the document,

and we will officially
no longer be roommates.

What's the matter?

(SIGHS)

It's harder than I thought.

- Let me help you. L-E-O-N-A--
- That helped!

So, I have an idea for a filk song.

It's kind of a power ballad,

superhero crossover tale
of epic proportions.

- Is it cold in here? 'Cause... Oh, my!
- (BOTH GIGGLE)

Okay, so it's a David and Goliath story.

It's about man against God.

It's called <i>Hammer and Whip:</i>

<i>The Untold Story of Thor
versus Indiana Jones.</i>

Thor versus Indiana Jones.

- You just blew my filking mind.
- (CHUCKLES)

Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet,
but I was thinking something like, um...

(SINGING) <i>Oh, Indy</i>

<i>Oh, Indy</i>

<i>The skies are so windy</i>

<i>Is that a flying man with a killer bod?</i>

<i>Wait! That's no man, it's a Norse god</i>

- Oh, yes, definitely. Okay, wait. Hang on.
- Yeah.

(HUMMING)

(SINGING) <i>Thunder clapped
as Thor raised his mighty hammer</i>

<i>Indy rapped, "That's one bad mamma-jamma"</i>

- That is so good!
- Right?

"Mamma-jamma" just came to me! (CHUCKLES)

Okay, and here's the hook. Uh...

(SINGING) <i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>One plays with lightning
The other plays with bones</i>

BOTH: (SINGING) <i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>One plays with lightning
The other plays with bones</i>

Oh...

Oh, man, that rocks!

- Hey, remember the Ark of the Covenant?
- Yeah?

That's how much
we're gonna melt people's faces off.

I appreciate your interest
in the apartment.

I just need to ask you
a few standard questions.

- Sure.
- It says here you're a chemist.

Which element on the periodic table
do you feel is too big for its britches?

Is that supposed to be a joke?

Looks like argon's not the only one
with an attitude problem.

In general, would you say that
you smell better, worse, or the same

as you do right now?

I was going to ask you
what is the best fruit,

but then I realized
what I wanna ask you is

why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm,

but then I realized
what I really wanna ask you is,

can you just go?

You're healthy,
you have a job in the sciences.

I've got to say,
if this credit report comes back good,

you're the front-runner.

<i>I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.</i>

(SCOFFS) But I met with 11 people
and they all walked out.

And that Hollywood phony Chris Pratt
never tweeted me back.

<i>I'm sure you'll find somebody else.</i>

I suppose.

What happened to me, Amy?

Years ago, I was
completely disengaged from my feelings.

I'd say it was a happier time,
but I was disengaged from my feelings,

so who can tell?

<i>I don't know how to help you.
You know, feelings are a part of life.</i>

Well, they didn't used to be.

You and Leonard and Penny,
you all poisoned me with emotions.

I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content,
until that evil wizard gave him a heart.

<i>I don't think that was
the point of the movie.</i>

Fine, then I was like Pinocchio

before that jerk Geppetto
went and made him a real boy.

<i>There you go.</i>

- So, what are you thinking for dinner?
- Well, it's Thai food night.

Oh, honey, you don't live
with Sheldon anymore.

You can have anything you want.

(CHUCKLES) You're right.

But what?

Mexican?

Italian? German?

Indian? Greek?

Cuban? Chinese? Pizza?
Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?

- How about Thai food?
- Oh, thank God.

Hey, we're going to dinner.
You wanna come?

Oh, I wish I could.

But I realized I've become
too emotionally vulnerable.

So like an operating system,

I'm restoring my life
to the last stable version,

which was in 2003,
the day before I met Leonard.

- You heard him, no.
- Hang on.

Wait, you actually think it's 2003?

No, just because I'm living my life
like it was 12 years ago,

doesn't mean I'm delusional.

And, since it is 2003,
I don't know who you are,

so please exit the premises

before I call the police
on my stylish, new flip phone.

Are you doing okay?

I guess. Just, you know,
worried about Sheldon.

Well, come on. He's a grown man in his 30s

pretending to be a grown man
in his 20s. He's fine.

I hope so.

What else can you do?
Move back in with him?

No, of course not, I just feel bad.

Well, so do I.

But don't you want to live with your wife

and set the thermostat
to whatever you want?

And have your body tell you when it's time
to go to the bathroom?

You know, not a schedule slipped
underneath your door every morning.

I did like that he had the weather on it.

Trust me, this is the right thing.

No, I know.
And it's not like we're abandoning him.

Plus, we can FaceTime him
whenever we want.

You know, once iPhones
are invented in his universe. (CHUCKLES)

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

I can't believe Sheldon
asked you to be his roommate.

I can't believe he ran my credit.

Hey, if you're open
to living with someone great,

I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.

You really should've gone on the Internet
and checked how long

that kind of thing lives
before you got one.

I'm sorry, I just thought you might have
a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.

Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky,
but he's also brilliant and insightful.

I think calling him
a weirdo is a little unfair.

Hello, 2003!

Hey, we brought you Thai...

Where is everything?

In my present, it's in the future.

In your present,
it's been crammed in the bedroom

by an enterprising, young man
I met in The Home Depot parking lot.

I know what you're doing.

You're trying to get attention
so we'll feel bad for you,

but it's not happening.

No, what I'm doing is
trying to figure out how to live my life,

now that everyone is leaving me.

Knock it off! We're across the hall.

As the kids are saying today,
"Talk to the hand."

They're not saying that.

They are in 2003.

No, no, they're really not.

(SINGING) <i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>One runs from Loki</i>

<i>The other runs from stones</i>

So, what do you think?

- Wow!
- Yeah.

"Runs from stones" means that big boulder,

but I just couldn't
rhyme anything with "boulder."

Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder--

Right. Yeah, right.

But what do you think?

I think it's very cute.

Cute? It's not cute.

Cute is children dressed as vegetables.

Okay, fine, it's not cute.

(SCOFFS) Just be honest,
you don't like it.

I didn't say that.
I just like music you can dance to.

You can dance to this!

Uh... Uh...

(SINGING) <i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>Thor and Doctor Jones</i>

<i>One plays with lightning
The other plays with bones</i>

I'm telling you, dude,
the song has no groove.

You can't dance to it.

Who cares? I thought the whole point

of Footprints on the Moon was
to write songs that make people think.

You can do both.
Like Michael Jackson's <i>Billie Jean?</i>

While you're dancing you're thinking,
like, "Darn it, whose baby is it?"

Where's this coming from?
A few hours ago, we both loved this song.

I still love it.
I just think there's room for improvement.

You played it for Emily, didn't you?

- Yeah, so what?
- You are such a wimp!

I mean, she didn't like it,
now you don't like it.

No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician.
You're the one who's stuck in the past.

"The past" was lunch!

You know what's really happening here?

Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.

Wait, she has nothing to do with this.
I am my own man.

Oh, please! Your brain belongs
to whoever's willing to sleep with you.

That is so not true!

Really? Remember when you were gonna
get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?

That had nothing to do with Rachel.

It was an overreaction
to a bad zipper injury.

I don't need this.

- I'm quitting the band!
- Fine, I quit, too!

- Then get out of my house!
- With pleasure!

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

Raj, wait!

What took you so long?

Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny
feels like a big change, but it's not.

How can you say that?
Amy's gone, and you two are married now,

so it's only a matter of time
before you're gone, too.

Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.

No, I do. Eventually,
you'll want more space,

and you'll move into a house.

And then instead of dinner
a couple of times a week,

it'll only be a couple of times a month.

And then it'll only be
on special occasions,

like when Bernadette
divorces Wolowitz, you know?

Or like when Koothrappali's
weird girlfriend admits

where she buried his body, you know?

Or Amy's wedding, where she's
marrying someone better than me.

Okay, look, we don't need
to rush into anything.

All right?

Maybe instead of Leonard
moving in with me, we just

leave things the way they are.

And sometimes we'll sleep over there,
and sometimes we'll sleep over here.

But mostly here.

Sure.

What about what you said
in the restaurant?

Well, it's not forever.
It's just for a little while.

If you want,
we could think of him like he's our dog.

You can, you know.

I'm happy when you come home,

and I'm scared of fireworks.

By the way, on July fourth,
we're all sleeping here.

- Fine.
- All right, great!

Just give me one minute,

and I'll get started
on a new roommate agreement.

Yeah, nothing from Pratt, we're good.

Play something we can dance to!

English - SDH

- Hey, ready for lunch?
- Oh, one sec.

Is that the prototype drive system
for the high-G rover?

No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit
so she can track how much I'm exercising.

That'll teach her
to care about your health.

Yeah, I can't wait to see
the look on her face when I die young.

(CHUCKLES)

When was the last actual exercise you got?

The other day, when she tried to

put that Fitbit on me,
and I ran away from her.

According to a recent study,
simply thinking about exercise,

even while sitting still,
can have physical benefits.

For all you know,
I could be exercising right now.

- Are you?
- Nah, I'll do it tomorrow.

It wouldn't be the worst thing
if we were more active.

Well, you make an excellent point.

Ooh! I think I'm getting a runner's high.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Look at all these activities
the university has.

Rock climbing club, archery,
flag football...

Had me at "flag", lost me at "football".

You know, I think it's great
you guys want to get more exercise,

but do you really think sports
is the right choice for you?

What are you saying?

We're not coordinated enough
to play sports?

(CLEARS THROAT) Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,
you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.

(SIGHS) I got a triple-word score
with a double letter Q.

If that's not a time to bust out
the Scrabble dance,

what's the point of having one?

Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.

Interesting. Sword fighting does hold
a certain elegant appeal.

And I would imagine it meets
many of our personal criteria for a sport.

- It's indoors, so no sunscreen.
- Mmm.

No throwing, no catching, no running.

No gym shorts that can be yanked down.

Or worse, up.

Preach.

And as an added bonus,
the word "touchÃ©" comes from fencing.

It'd be our only opportunity to use it
in a non-metaphorical sense.

What about a game of tag
on a French schoolyard?

Ah, touchÃ©.

- Thanks for coming by.
- Sure. So, how can we help?

Well, I know more women
are buying comics than ever,

but for some reason,
I can't get them in here.

All right, well,
what have you tried so far?

Uh, I've been stocking
more female-oriented titles.

In the bathroom, I folded the end
of the toilet paper into a triangle.

And you are now sitting
in the official breast-feeding area.

Really, in a comic book store?

Oh, don't worry.
I've got a camera right up here

so I could watch from the counter,
make sure guys aren't being pervs.

Anyway, so, what do I got to do to,
to get you in the door?

Well, for starters, you might wanna
rethink some of this artwork.

I mean, this woman's actually on a leash
like a dog.

Well, you don't know the backstory.
Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.

I feel cool.

Like Puss in Boots.

I always wanted to be a swashbuckler
when I was a kid.

Technically, "swashbuckler"
is a combination of two terms.

"Swash", referring to
the sound of the sword... Swash...

And then "buckler", meaning a small
shield, which you don't have.

We can still be swashers.

Well said, Puss.

Gentlemen. Welcome to the Fencing Club.

Before we start, I just wanna warn you,
fencing isn't a joke.

I hope you're not here because you think
it's going to be like <i>Star Wars.</i>

That's not why we're here.

Yeah, I'm here because I think
it's gonna be like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

- Maybe a little <i>Princess Bride.</i>
- Ooh! I forgot about <i>Princess Bride.</i>

That's my answer.

Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but fencing is a serious sport.

If you're not willing
to put in the effort,

you might as well just leave now.

We're not afraid of physical activity.

Yeah, I already ran 18 miles today.

All right,
let's begin with some fundamentals.

This is the <i>en garde</i> position,

feet are in a L, heels in a straight line,
elbow's about a fist from the rib cage.

- Notice my dominant leg faces forward.
- Oh, dear.

(SIGHS) What's wrong, Cooper?

Yeah, well,
I'm not sure I have a dominant leg.

They're both pretty submissive.

When you're in a public restroom,
which foot do you flush the toilet with?

Right, always right.

He's a righty.

Okay, show me <i>en garde.</i>

Good. Knees bent, slightly over the toe.
Non-sword hand up for balance.

(GRUNTS) I am going to feel this tomorrow.

Okay, the first move is called an advance.

You move your front foot forward,
heel to toe.

Back foot follows.

So, front foot forward, heel to toe,
back foot follows.

Now you try. Advance.

And advance.

And advance.

This is easy, I didn't need to wear a cup.

Good. This next move is called a retreat.

Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel,
front foot follows.

- On three--
- Excuse me, Barry?

- Yes.
- When can I stab one of my friends?

In fencing, we don't call it a stab,
we call it a touch.

Yes, I'm aware, but if I say
I wanna touch one of my friends,

I'll get called into Human Resources.

Okay, on three,
Cooper and Koothrappali advance,

the other two retreat. One, two, three.

Very good. Switch it up. One, two, three.

Switch again. One, two, three.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Excuse me.

Can I call you back?

<i>No, I'm teaching a class.</i>

Yeah.

<i>Okay, okay, yeah.</i>

Okay, thanks.

And one, two, three.

Have you thought about
advertising directly to females?

Hmm. Okay. Well, all right.

What if I put up a sign in the window
that said,

"Women, come in. Don't be afraid."

Hey, have you read the online reviews
for this place?

The Internet's so negative.
I try to avoid it.

All right, well, Heather H says,

"The owner stared at me the whole time
and didn't blink once."

Kelly M says, "The creepy guy who runs it
asked me out,

"then called himself stupid
before I could say no."

Jessica K says, "I told the weird owner
that I liked his shirt.

"He took it off and gave it to me."

See? Negative.

With your foil extended,

kick your front leg up
and push off with your back leg.

Now you try.

<i>And again.</i>

<i>And again.</i>

Look at us, we're like <i>The Rockettes.</i>

SHELDON: <i>En garde,</i> Leonard.

Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.

(FENCES CLASHING)

HOWARD: My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

RAJ: My name is Inigo Montoya.

You killed my father. Prepare to die.

HOWARD: I thought you were Puss in Boots.
RAJ: Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

My name is Puss in Boots.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

I'm looking forward to him
teaching us glove-slapping.

What?

You know, when my honor is insulted,
and I need to challenge someone

to a duel by slapping them across the face
with my glove.

When was your honor insulted?

My last physical.

Again, that doctor
didn't insult your honor,

he just checked your prostate.

RAJ: My name is Little Orphan Annie.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

HOWARD: My name is Darth Vader.
I am your father. Prepare to die.

SHELDON: This is fun.

LEONARD: Well, good.
It's nice to see your mind off Amy.

What's going on with Amy?

SHELDON: Not that it's any of your
business, but she broke up with me.

Really? Good to know.

SHELDON: "Good to know"?
What's that supposed to mean?

Oh, I hate to say it,
but it sounds like he's interested in her.

Well, that's unacceptable.

Buddy, I get that you don't like it,
but it's not really up to you.

Yeah, well, but he's dumb
and his face is dumb.

Look, even if it's not him,

Amy's probably gonna date someone
at some point.

- You really think so?
- Of course. She deserves to be happy.

How dare you.

Listen, I should warn you that maybe
asking Amy out isn't a good idea.

Barry, a word.

And now the crazy version
of what I just said.

If you intend to pursue Amy,

you leave me with no choice
but to put a stop to it.

And how are you gonna do that?

By challenging you to a duel.

You've had one lesson. I'll destroy you.

That is why the duel will take place
at high noon,

three years from today.

If you're worth your salt
as an instructor,

I should be ready by then.

Yeah, and be warned,
I'm going to touch you all over.

Wow! That was crazier than I thought.

All right, I'm not saying it's true,

but let's, let's consider for a moment
that possibly I'm the problem.

- Yeah.
- You are.

You can say it.

Fine. But I mean, what can I do?
I get so nervous around women.

Well, you're talking to us now.
I mean, you don't seem nervous.

Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick
where you imagine the audience is naked.

By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?

(CHUCKLES) It was a joke.

Was it?

Nah, I'm still doing it.

Okay, don't be offended,
but what went wrong with you?

I guess I assumed at this point
in my life,

I would be married or in a relationship,

or even have a pet that didn't run away
or kill itself.

That really happened?

I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear
that rabbit looked me right in the eye

before it hopped in front of that car.

Anyway, the longer I'm alone,
the more desperate I get.

Stuart, believe it or not, I understand.

You know, before I met Sheldon,
I was alone for a really long time.

I was so desperate for people to like me,
when I met these guys,

it took everything in my power
to hide my insecurity.

Okay, we're all feeling it.
Yes, I'll go out with you.

Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.

I'm surprised you wanted to go
to a sports bar, Sheldon.

Look at this blister.

Like it or not, we're athletes now.

Besides, a bar is where I belong.
I'm having female problems.

If you're cranky and retaining water,
I have a theory.

Sheldon, instead of focusing on
Amy dating other guys,

maybe you should start thinking about
dating another girl.

That's ridiculous.

Why? You never thought you'd end up
in a relationship, and then you met Amy.

Maybe there's someone else out there
for you.

True. But Penny's married,
and so is Bernadette.

And your girlfriend has red hair
and white skin,

which really rubs up
against my clown phobia.

Maybe you should consider women

who aren't in serious relationships
with your closest friends.

There's that prostate doctor,
but I'm still mad at her.

Oh, there's a woman.
I'll make her my girlfriend.

Whoa!

Walking up to a strange woman in a bar
usually doesn't work.

You're forgetting something.

Ladies love jocks.

- How many sips of that beer did he have?
- Three.

Oh, boy.

Excuse me.
I'm recovering from a recent break-up.

Now, I'm told asking out another woman
might make me feel better.

And as Ash Ketchem said to Pikachu,
"I choose you."

What?

It's a <i>PokÃ©mon</i> reference.

I don't know what that means.

Well, we gave it a shot.

How about you?

I'm married. And I'm her grandmother.

Ah, what might have been.

And you, give my regards
to Barnum and Bailey.

Stuart took that rejection like a pro.

Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.

I don't have much experience
turning men down.

It wasn't so much fun.

Um, you get used to it.

Some guys you have to turn down
over and over.

And sometimes we marry them anyway.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Huh!

- Well, this is weird.
- What?

- Barry Kripke just asked me out.
- (GASPS)

Oh! Look at you, two guys in one day.

I told you things would change
if you plucked your eyebrows.

What did he say?

"Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you'd
like to get a drink after work sometime."

Well, what are you gonna do?

I don't know.

I guess I assumed that
I would eventually date other people,

but this is happening so fast.

What can it hurt?

Well, I was hoping the next person I dated
would be a little less like Sheldon.

You mean not a scientist?

I think she means not a weirdo.

Are you attracted to him?

I don't know.

All right, well, what happens
if you imagine him naked?

Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

(GASPS)

I smell funny.

I taste salty.

You're just sweaty from exercise.

I'm kind of delicious.

I wonder how many licks it would take
to get to the center of me.

I know it only takes one doctor's finger.

- Hello.
- Hello.

- We should let you guys talk.
- Yeah.

- You don't have to leave.
- But look at me go.

- Bernadette, you're my ride.
- Walk!

How've you been?

I'm doing all right.

I tried fencing today.

- How'd that go?
- It was pretty easy.

And I think my background
in mathletics helped.

Barry Kripke was there.

I should let you know that he expressed
interest in asking you out.

Actually, he already did.

Okay. But don't get too attached to him.

In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.

I said no.

Interesting.

I asked two women out today,
and they both said no.

I didn't know
you were interested in dating.

I've been told it's a good way to move on.

Oh!

Okay.

Anyway, um, it's nice to see you.
You look good.

Thanks, and I taste good, too.

Howie?

What's up?

Why does your Fitbit say
you ran a 174 miles yesterday?

English - SDH

- Leonard, I've got terrible news.
- What's going on?

Before I tell you,
perhaps I should soften the blow.

Your face is pleasingly symmetrical.

Just tell me.

A Swedish team of physicists

is trying to scoop
our superfluid vortex experiment.

That kinda stinks.

"That kinda stinks"?

Why aren't you more upset?
Did I soften the blow too much?

Yeah, because this, here,
is more like a Picasso painting.

- What are we gonna do?
- Perform the experiment, immediately.

Well, I'd love to,
but we need liquid helium,

and our shipment's on back order
for a month.

A month? Are you kidding me?

That would've been a good time for you
to soften the blow.

That shirt brings out
the blue in your eyes.

Thank you, aren't you sweet.

Let's go check to see if the university
has any helium in reserve.

Did you know that
I almost didn't wear this shirt today?

Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.
We need liquid helium.

Does the department have any we can use?

Sorry, there's a shortage.

And what we do have,
I need for my quantum excitation study.

But you won't need much for that.

True. But if it's successful,
I'm having a party with balloons.

Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team
trying to run our experiment before us.

Can you spare any?

Be honest.

If the shoe was on the other foot,
would you do this for me?

- Yes.
- Not a chance.

- What are you doing?
- He said, "Be honest," so I was honest.

Didn't your mother tell you?
It's the best policy.

- So, what do you say?
- Hell, no.

He could have softened the blow.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Why do you need Kripke?

Can't you just go to
Party City for helium?

We'd have to go to every Party City
in California.

Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.

Hey, people were still talking about
that party on <i>Siete de Mayo.</i>

Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us,

I will never be able to enjoy anything
from their country again.

Which is a shame,

because Swedish meatballs are my favorite
toothpick-delivered meatball.

If you need liquid helium so bad,

I know a guy who can get you some
if you don't ask too many questions.

- Who is he?
- Where does he work?

- How does he get the helium?
- How many questions is too many questions?

- Maybe he's not for you.
- Four questions. The answer's four.

Hey, you know who went on a date
the other night? Stuart.

- Oh, good for him.
- I thought so too.

So is she, like, homeless
or framing him for a crime?

He's using some kinda dating app
on his phone.

Oh, which one?
Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

I don't know.
Stuart, can you come in here?

He tried to explain it to me.

It shows you pictures of people nearby,
you swipe them around,

it looks kinda like a game.

Oh! And if you lose the game,
you have to go out with Stuart.

(CHUCKLES)

- What's up?
- Can you show us that dating app?

Oh, yeah, sure.

This thing has changed my life.

- Wow! So, how many girls have you met?
- Two.

I probably don't need to mention there is
an entire number between that and zero.

Well, so, how does it work?

Uh, well it shows me all the single women,

in a five-mile radius,
who are using the app.

If I like the way they look,
I hit thumbs up.

If I don't, thumbs down.

Oh! What would make you give a girl
a thumbs down?

First time it happens,
I will let you know.

Oh, hey, I just heard back
from the liquid helium guy.

Oh! What's he say?

He's got what we need,
and can meet us tonight.

Really?

You know I don't like buying things
at night.

January 7th, 2009.

I went to the Ralphs at 11:30 p.m.

to pick up Cracklin' Oat Bran
for the morning, and what did I see?

- The man restocking the cereal shelves.
- That's right. And what did he do?

He handed you the box directly
and called you "Stretch."

(SHUDDERS)
It's like it was yesterday.

- Do you want liquid helium or not?
- Of course, I do!

I don't want that
Swedish team scooping us.

Well, then, I'm gonna tell him we're in.

Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.

Oh! We're just bending the rules a little.

We have grant money to do the experiment,

so we're gonna spend it
on the helium we need.

It's not like when Doctor Goldfarb claimed
he bought an electron microscope,

but he was really just keeping a
Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.

Was she helping him with his research?

Sure.

So, we doing this?

- But where does he get the helium?
- Remember? Don't ask too many questions.

But this is violating university code.

A little, but...

(SIGHS) If I may quote Einstein,

"The pursuit of science calls us
to ignore the rules set by man."

Huh.

All right, do it. Tell him we're in.

Done.

I can't find that quote on the Internet.
Did you make that up?

Before I answer, may I just say,
your skin has never looked better.

Aren't you just made of sugar?

I'm not sure, how I feel about this.

Oh, come on.
Just let him put the app on your phone.

Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.

One of which would've ended in sex,
had she not said no.

- Okay, all set.
- Okay, let me see. (CLEARS THROAT)

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Oh! He's cute.

Doesn't a teardrop tattoo mean
he murdered someone?

And he's sad about it.

- Hey.
- Hello.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- I thought you were gonna be out late.
- If you wanted me to stay out later,

you should've given me
more spending money.

What are you guys up to?

We put Amy on a dating app
and we're seeing what's out there.

Oh, fun, let me see.

Uh, no.

No. Definitely not.

What was wrong with that guy?

Uh, he's Indian.
We've already got one of those.

Ooh! We should find a nice Latino,
really round us out.

I wanna try.

Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?

Yeah, hang on. I'm trying to find you
the next great love of your life.

The man who will father your children.

Okay, yes or no
on white guy with dreadlocks.

(ALL CLAMORING)

(SIGHS) That must be him.

Of course, a nondescript white panel van.

You may be familiar with it
from the sentence,

"Their bodies were found
in a nondescript white panel van."

(DOORS CLOSING)

- Hey.
- What's up?

- Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend--
- I'm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.

- Great. You got the cash?
- Uh, yeah. Right here.

Wait, no, hold on, hold on.

How do we know that you're not gonna
take the money and drive away?

What are you doing, Skippy?

Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas
have taught us.

You give us the helium first.

Oh, how do I know you're not gonna
drive away without paying me?

Guess I'm not the only one who watched
'70s television crime dramas.

Look, you can trust us,
we're respected scientists.

Well, he is.

I'm a wedding planner
who can't find love himself.

It's ironic, but the point is...

We can't trust you,

you're a sketchy character
in a parking garage.

Yeah, Well, from my perspective,
that's how you two appear to me.

Well, I never thought of it like that.

Boy, frame of reference
will just sneak up on you, won't it?

My friend does make a decent point
about the money.

I don't feel comfortable
just handing it over up front.

Uh-uh-uh, no money, no helium.

Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

Not technically.

In chess,
a stalemate refers to a situation

in which there are no remaining moves.

<i>You have plenty of moves available.</i>

You could beat us up
and steal the money...

You could kill us...

Really, you're only limited
by your imagination.

Huh.

All these years,

I've been using "stalemate"
when I really mean "impasse."

I feel foolish.

Eh, I don't think it matters

if this is a stalemate or an impasse
or a Mexican standoff.

What are we gonna do here?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How could it be a Mexican standoff?

Everybody knows
you need three sides for that.

Not necessarily.

Uh, many argue,
the essence of a Mexican standoff is that

no one can walk away from the conflict
without incurring harm.

Hmm. I don't follow.

Let me give you an example.

Earlier today,
I decoded the headers on your email,

and I know that your name
is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

Now, from that, I figured out
where you live and where you work.

Now, to make this a Mexican standoff,
I would say something like,

"You give us the helium,
or I'll turn you in to the authorities."

- Is that a threat?
- Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

Yeah, well, I know where you work,
all right? And if you mess with me,

I'll report you, then,
I'll pound your asses into the ground.

Perfect! Now, we really are
in a Mexican standoff.

Is this one of those times where
I've won the battle but lost the war?

Afraid so, Skippy.

I told you,
we shouldn't go shopping at night.

All right, let's all just calm down.
Nobody wants to report anybody.

Nah, I don't like this. I'm out.

No, no, no. Wait, don't go.
Just let me explain.

We're physicists,
and we're trying to prove a hypothesis

that we've been working on,
for over a year.

Really? What's the hypothesis?

Space-time can be interpreted as the
surface of an N-dimensional superfluid.

Hmm. Could be. Could be, go on.

Okay, okay.
But now, there's this Swedish team,

that read our paper and they're trying to
beat us to our own discovery.

We really need this helium.

And I'm sorry I lied about being
a wedding planner who can't find love.

Although I am currently single,
if you know anybody.

Here's the money. Can we do this?

Okay.

It's a shame about those scientists
ripping you off.

I expected a higher ethical standard
from our friends in Sweden.

It's actually pretty common in our field.
Not much you can do about it.

Well, for the right amount of money,
if you know where they live,

there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

Do you hear that, Leonard?
There's plenty we could do about it.

Do you have a card?

Okay, here we go, now everyone can see.

All right. (CLEARS THROAT)
Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?

You know
he won't be looking at other girls.

(ALL CHUCKLING)

Unless they are sitting on
the end of his nose.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Okay, okay, okay, thumbs down. Next.

Ooh! Check out his tiny teeth,
he looks like a man-dolphin.

Well, if he's good in bed,
she can throw him a fish.

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
I love you, Amy. (IMITATES DOLPHIN)

Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty.
Aren't we being a little mean?

That's a fair point.

We wouldn't make fun of someone like this
to their face.

Look, it's Stuart.

You may wanna leave the room.

SHELDON: <i>Right this way, Uncle Harvey.</i>

- Will you stop with that already?
- I am trying not to attract attention.

And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady
didn't do that?

She said <i>buenas noches.</i>
What was he supposed to do?

Let's just start the experiment.

Leonard, we should probably have our
stories straight in case we get caught.

We're not getting caught.

Well, you can't be sure of that.

What if the helium dealer rats us out?

<i>What if Kripke asks where we got it?</i>

What if the university checks
my family tree and finds out,

I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

The dealer doesn't care,
Kripke has no authority over us,

and you being related to
a metal container, would explain a lot.

Help me hook this up.

- Uh-oh.
- What?

- Well, did you see this sticker?
- What is it?

It's partially torn off,

but the segment that remains reads,
"Property of" and the letter "U".

It's probably USC or UCLA.

Yeah, but what if it's
"Property of U.S. Government"?

There's a national helium reserve in
Amarillo, Texas.

If this was stolen from there,
we're accessories to a federal crime.

Let's not jump to conclusions.
A lot of things start with U.

That's true. There's the U.S. Air Force,
U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Navy.

U and I are going to jail.

Listen, we can do the experiment
as planned

and beat the Swedish team to the punch,

or we can kiss our dreams goodbye because
we were too afraid to break a few rules.

Ma'am.

Okay. Does everyone remember the rules?

If he's shirtless, one sip.
Posing with a pet, two sips.

Pet and shirtless,
chug like it's your job.

And pull.

I have that same underwear.

Chug.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Mm. Amy, you're getting a text.

Oh, um, give me that.

(RAJ READING)

No, no, no. Stop reading that.

- Who's Dave?
- I--

You went on a date last night?
Are you seeing someone?

No, it-it's not like that.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

- "And I'd love to take you out again"?
- (AMY SIGHS)

- Amy, that's crazy.
- Oh, my God.

Okay, it's like that.

Thank you for coming back.

Yeah, well, normally, I wouldn't.

But my daughter's having a sleepover,

and there's only so much screaming
and Katy Perry a man can take.

Anyway, if you could
just give us our money back,

you can have your helium
and we'll be on our way.

Yeah, well,
is there something wrong with it?

No, nothing. We just changed our mind.

He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all,
we are not built for prison.

Yeah, I hear you.
Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh...

- I'll take the helium off your hands.
- Thank you.

But you ain't getting your money back.

You're taking advantage of us?
We clarified nomenclature together.

Look, I enjoy semantic digressions
as much as the next guy,

but, uh, this is business.

You know what? It's fine, keep the money.
We just wanna be done with this.

No problem, but I am gonna have to
charge you a small helium restocking fee.

- Well, I don't understand.
- He wants more money.

Well it better not be more than $1,000,
that's all I've got on me.

That's exactly how much it is.

Finally, something breaks our way.

I can't believe you're seeing someone
and we don't even know about it.

Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?

Because it's new and weird
and I'm just trying to figure it all out.

And I knew if I told you guys
I had been out with a few people,

- that you'd get way too excited about it--
- A few?

- What?
- Amy.

So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?

It's going fine. It's mostly just been
meeting people for coffee.

Wha?

I thought we were all... Never mind.

I-I thought you weren't ready
to start seeing people?

Well, I don't have much experience dating,

so I decided it would be good for me to,
you know, get out there a little.

Well, good for you.

Thank you.

And how many guys have you gone out with?

- Please be less than two.
- Three.

Damn it.

Well, the Swedes might beat us,

but at least we won't get
gang-noogied in prison.

Is <i>Ernest Goes to Jail</i>
the only prison movie you've seen?

It scared me straight, Leonard.

(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)

Hey, I've been thinking,
I was being petty. You can have my helium.

Thank you, Barry.

But you have to add my name to your paper.

That's preposterous.

I don't know, seems fair,
you can't do it without me.

- Can you give us a minute?
- Take your time.

I'll walk out backwards
for a dramatic effect.

I don't like being extorted like this.
Especially by him of all people.

Me neither,
but what other choice do we have?

I promise this is the last time.

It says right here on Wikipedia.

"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation
between at least three parties."

(SCOFFS) How can you trust Wikipedia

if they use "between"
to refer to three parties?

They should've used "among," right?

Or "amongst,"
if they were feeling whimsically archaic.

Enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna
watch <i>Ernest Goes To Jail</i> or not?

Absolutely.

But don't be surprised if this movie
sets you on the straight and narrow.

I am open to change.

English - SDH

Did you hear about this study
that found people

that were cool and popular at 13
have problems succeeding later in life?

Hmm. I'm doing okay
and I was very popular at 13.

- In school?
- Oh, no, at home.

The servants would sing to me,
laugh at my jokes.

I wish I knew their names.

Does the study say
what happens to the unpopular kids?

You tell me. You woke up in bed with one.

Listen to this.
I just received an email from Wil Wheaton.

Leonard Nimoy's son is working
on a documentary

that he started with his father
before he passed away.

It's about Mr. Spock
and his impact on our culture.

Why is he writing to you?

Well, they're looking for fans
to interview

- and Wil thought I'd be good for it.
- Oh. Hey, high five.

Absolutely not.

Yeah, Penny, you've spent some time
in front of the camera.

Any words of advice?

Yes, don't take your shirt off
just because the director said so.

This is a documentary about Mr. Spock.

I'm sure if there's nudity
it will be tasteful.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(SWORDS SLASHING ON TV)

Hey, you got a minute?

Not really.
Visigoths are kinda up my butt right now.

Pause the game, Howard.

Howard? Oh-oh. Make room, Visigoths.

'Sup?

We need to talk about
redecorating this place.

(SIGHS) No, not this again.

(SIGHS) Look, I get that you grew up here,

and you're attached to things
looking a certain way,

but I want this to feel like
my house, too.

(CHUCKLING) Oh. Honey,
of course it's your house.

Why else would you be cleaning it
all the time?

(CHUCKLES)

All right, let's start over.

I'm redecorating.
The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.

I'm changing everything that depresses me
when I look at it.

Try not to be one of those things.

May I say something?

Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper

'cause your dad left
when you were little and your mom died?

Never mind.

Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

Yeah, I know that we're broken up but
I'm leaving this message because

I thought perhaps
you'd like to watch me be interviewed

for a documentary about Mr. Spock.

Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.
(LAUGHS)

Yeah, I'm going to use that joke
in the interview,

so try to laugh
like you're hearing it for the first time.

You know, hysterically.

And with a tinge of sadness
that I'm no longer in your life.

I'm the one who thought of Spockumentary.

And I'm laughing like I did
the first time I heard it.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

- Hello.
- Hey, Sheldon.

- This is Adam Nimoy.
- Nice to meet you.

Oh, it's nice to meet you.

I admire your father's work very much.

It's not every day I get to meet someone

whose life's journey began
in my hero's scrotum.

I told you, this guy is gold.

Whatcha doing?

Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich

like my mom used to make me
after my dad left but before she died.

Okay, listen, I'm thinking that maybe
we can compromise on the house.

I'm listening.

Let's just redo one room
and see how it goes.

That is reasonable, but what room?

- How about this one?
- No way, no.

This is the room
I associate the most with my mom.

- Then how about the bathroom?
- I wanna change my answer.

Fine, then the dining room.

I guess we didn't use it very often.
Unless we had company.

Which didn't happen much after
my dad left but not at all after my mom--

Great, I'm gonna go
pick out paint samples.

All right.
We're just gonna have a conversation,

pretend the camera's not here.

All right.

But this better not be some elaborate
scheme to get me out of my shirt.

- How long have you known Adam?
- A few years.

- And what are you getting him back for?
- (CHUCKLES)

Let's start with your name and occupation.

<i>Doctor Sheldon Cooper,
Theoretical Physicist, Caltech.</i>

ADAM: <i>And what is your earliest memory
of the character Spock?</i>

<i>The first episode of</i>
Star Trek: The Original Series <i>I ever saw</i>

<i>was</i> The Galileo Seven.

<i>Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet
Taurus II.</i>

<i>Then my brother came in, sat on my head
and said, "Eat farts."</i>

<i>After that day I was hooked.</i>

<i>On</i> Star Trek,
<i>not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.</i>

What was it about Spock
that appealed to you?

<i>I think the same thing that
appeals to people everywhere.</i>

<i>The dream of a cold rational world
entirely without human emotion.</i>

<i>Spock came from a planet
governed only by logic.</i>

<i>You know, on Vulcan,
when your brother asks,</i>

<i>"Why are you hitting yourself?"
The answer is,</i>

<i>"I'm not. You're moving my arm."</i>

<i>To which he says, "Fascinating."</i>

<i>And then you both watch
educational television.</i>

Oh. When he says things like that I just
wanna hug him and make everything better.

- My brother was mean to me, too.
- Yeah, you probably had it coming.

Do you have any Spock collectibles?

<i>I have many.</i>

<i>My most treasured is an autographed napkin</i>

<i>given to me
by my very thoughtful friend, Penny.</i>

<i>That's her over there.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

(CHUCKLES) Look at that, I'm in a movie,
my shirt stayed on.

- Can we see the napkin?
- Of course.

Excuse me. This will just take a moment.

When did we get a wall safe?

When there was no more room
in the floor safe.

When did we get a floor safe?

When we got the security camera.

There's a security camera?

Aquaman. Protecting your home since 2012.

Oh, my God,
we've done things on that couch.

Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

So, your father-in-law
is in there right now?

Yes, so back me up.
The house is good the way it is.

Okay. Got it.

- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.

Hey, Raj, Dad and I were just
talking about taking down this wall.

You sure? It's a pretty great wall.

What's so great about it?

I'm sorry, I did what I could.

Seriously? You brought Raj over
to take your side?

Your dad's on your side.

He's not on my side.
He's doing all the work for free.

That is so generous of you.

I'd like to switch sides.

Look, I don't even think you can take
this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.

Well, it's easy to find out, just go into
the crawlspace under the house and check.

When is your visa up?

Not only is it signed to me,

<i>but this is where he wiped his mouth.</i>

<i>So, we are currently in the presence
of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.</i>

Um, doesn't Adam count
as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

<i>No offense,
but this is pure 100 percent Nimoy.</i>

<i>Now, because of your mother,
you're only 50 percent.</i>

<i>Which isn't bad, but anything that
you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.</i>

Okay, enough about the napkin.
What else you hiding in there?

- Wouldn't you like to know.
- I would.

Yeah, all right, then.

See, it's just my valuables.
My passport, my will.

- You have a will?
- Yeah, my one-eighteenth scale

Wil Wheaton action figure.

<i>Yeah, I also have the other kind of will.
And in it I will my Wil back to Wil.</i>

- Will Wil want it?
- Wil won't.

- What's that ring box?
- Oh, that is an engagement ring,

<i>that I was going to give
my girlfriend Amy.</i>

What?

You bought her a ring?

<i>No, no, no, this has been in my family
for generations.</i>

<i>No, except for a short time when Comanches</i>

<i>cut off my great-great-great
grandmother's finger and stole it.</i>

Sheldon, that's awful.

<i>No, the Texas Rangers
tracked them down to their village</i>

<i>and slaughtered every last one of them.</i>

<i>It was a happy ending.</i>

<i>Well, for my nine-fingered nana.</i>

Okay, back to the ring.
Does Amy even know about this?

No, she broke up with me
before I could broach the subject.

Man, I'm sorry.
That must've been devastating for you.

No, not at all. No, I'm fine.

You know, Amy had reservations
about our relationship

so all worked out for the best.

- I know, it's just--
- I said I'm fine!

<i>We've gotten a little off topic.</i>

<i>Allow me to make things entertaining again
in this little Spockumentary.</i>

<i>That was Leonard's joke.</i>

<i>As a child, when faced with a dilemma,</i>

<i>my mother encouraged me to ask,
"What would Jesus do?"</i>

<i>The answer to that was always,
"Love thy neighbor."</i>

<i>But my neighbor had a dead tooth,</i>

<i>so that wasn't going to happen.</i>

<i>But that's why I changed it to,
"What would Spock do?"</i>

Did you find that helpful?

<i>Yes. No, for example, three years ago</i>

<i>when I discovered
Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts,</i>

<i>instead of getting angry or vindictive,
you know, I got a floor safe.</i>

I knew I could smell 'em.

- What about from when you were a kid?
<i>- Oh, certainly.</i>

<i>Uh, when I was eight years old,</i>

<i>Billy Sparks cornered me
in the playground.</i>

<i>I asked myself, "What would Spock do?"</i>

<i>Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder
and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.</i>

- Did it work?
<i>- Oh, no, he broke my collarbone.</i>

<i>Yeah, I can still hear it click.</i>

That must have been
very upsetting for you.

Oh, not at all. As I said,

<i>the entire point of emulating Spock
was to rise above human emotion,</i>

<i>which I've spent a lifetime mastering.</i>

Oh. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, I'm not here.

No, you went... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
What does... (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Mean?

- Uh...
- You did go... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Okay, fine.

Sheldon, I'm no expert, but aren't you
completely missing the point of Spock?

He liked to act like he had no emotions,
but he was still half-human.

Just like you.

I'm just saying, you pretend you don't,

but you have feelings
just like everybody else.

Not true. No, look at me.

I had an engagement ring to give a girl,
and instead she rejected me.

And am I emotional about that? No.

No, I am sitting here on a couch

talking about my favorite TV character
like nothing happened.

'Cause I am just like him.
All logical, all the time.

- Sweetie, you're yelling.
- Because when I speak at a regular volume

no one seems to believe me that
I've put this Amy nonsense behind me.

(DOOR SLAMS)

This documentary is gonna be awesome.

- You gonna be okay down here?
- Yeah.

I feel like an archeologist.

Indiana Jones
and the Single Family Dwelling.

Hey. Look. Found a seashell.

- Yeah, that's a rat skull.
- Oh!

Relax, there's enough droppings down here
without you making more.

Sorry. You have a sense of where we are?

- Yeah, I think that's the den.
- Oh.

Okay. So we must be under the dining room.

Uh-huh. Yep. You know,
I know you don't wanna hear this,

but it wouldn't take that much work
to turn that den into a nursery.

- Oh, why wouldn't I wanna hear it?
- 'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.

That's not true at all.

Well, I wish she'd get pregnant.
Believe me.

I'm climbing on top of her
every chance I get.

(EXHALES)

In a loving and respectful manner.

Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

The point is I really do want kids.

Huh.

I don't know why she's lying to you.

<i>She's the one who doesn't want kids.</i>

<i>In fact, every time I bring up the subject
she's always--</i>

Earthquake!

Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

Aftershock!

I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask
Amy to marry him.

I know.

I also can't believe he watched what
we did on that couch and still sits on it.

Yeah.

- Hello.
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?

Better.

- Did Wil and Adam leave?
- Yeah.

Do you think they're going to
put my outburst in the documentary?

- Oh, yeah.
- Definitely.

Well, there's no point dwelling on it.

As the Vulcans say...

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

- Do you know what that means?
- No.

Are you telling the truth?

(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

Well, this is ridiculous.

Being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

If I wanna resolve this situation
then I need to take action.

- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to find her

and ask her to marry me.

And if she says yes we can put this
behind us and resume our relationship.

If she says no, well then she can just...
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

He didn't mean that.

So, I should probably explain
why I kinda fibbed.

That would be nice.

I told my dad that you were the one
who didn't want kids

because I didn't wanna disappoint him.

But you were okay
throwing me under the bus?

Turns out, yeah,
I didn't think twice about it.

Bernie, you don't need to worry about me.

But I don't wanna see you miss out.

Raising children was the most
rewarding experience of my life.

Oh, please.

Mom did everything, all you did was

come home from work,
sit on the couch and drink beer.

How is that raising kids?

This is really a conversation
for husband and wife. (CHUCKLES)

I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road.

If your mother asks,
I was here till 10:00.

It's interesting.
Your father didn't help around the house

and Howard doesn't help either,

so in a way,
Howard's not only like your father

but he's also like the child
that you're afraid to have.

Why are you still here?

Fine, I'll leave. But it sounds like
somebody needs a fresh diaper.

All right.

I admit...

That I don't help out a lot. (CHUCKLES)

And I need to work on that.

But if we had a kid,
it would be different.

- Why?
- Because...

When my dad left,
I promised myself that...

If I ever had a chance to be a father...

I'd always be there.

Okay, I'll think about it.

And this is an actual
"I'll think about it?"

Not like the "Can we get a motorcycle
with a sidecar?

"I'll think about it?"

- It's an actual "I'll think about it."
- And I really believe I'd be a great dad.

- I know you would.
- (CHUCKLES)

Speaking of making babies,

what do you say I wash up
and poke around your crawlspace?

(INAUDIBLE)

<i>Dr. Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous.</i>

<i>What makes you right
and a trained psychiatrist wrong?</i>

<i>Because she feels. I don't.
All I know is logic.</i>

(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

You can just shut your feelings off.

There goes television, lying to us again.

We let you raise our children
and this is the thanks we get?

Leonard, how could I have been so foolish?

To try and follow in the footsteps of a
made-up alien race with no emotions?

(EXHALES) Well...

Now instead of idolizing
fictional characters,

you can focus on the real people
who are already in your life.

- Those are very wise words.
- Thank you.

They'd just be so much more comforting
if they came out of a television.

English - SDH

PENNY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

Well, there's no point dwelling on it.

As the Vulcans say...

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

- Do you know what that means?
- No.

You telling the truth?

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

Well, this is ridiculous.

Being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

If I wanna resolve this situation,
then I need to take action.

What are you gonna do?

I'm going to find her
and ask her to marry me.

And if she says yes, we can put this
behind us and resume our relationship.

If she says no, well, then she can just...
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

He didn't mean that.

(INAUDIBLE)

I think it's so adorable
you're making Sheldon breakfast.

Well, he's having a rough time.

Amy broke his heart,

the DVR cut off the last minute
of <i>Doctor Who.</i>

That crow followed him home.

Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?

Oh? Well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal?

Or thanks to you, what I will
now call "gloatmeal"? (CHUCKLES)

Oh, I don't want credit for that.

Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,
lovely to see you this fine morning.

- You're in a good mood.
- I am indeed.

I have decided, instead of
wallowing in sadness about Amy,

it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.

- Ah, good for you.
- What brought this on?

I realized something.
When Amy was in my life,

I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.

And you don't want to make the same
mistake with the next woman?

No, I need a new woman
in my life to ignore,

so I can hyper-focus on my work again.

Hey, I made French toast sticks.

- On oatmeal day?
- Ah, I also made oatmeal.

Oh, that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.

You know what? You eat it, you're married.

It doesn't matter what you look like.

Don't take advice from a man
who threw his shoe at a crow.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

- Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
- No problem.

So, what's up?

It was the two of you
who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,

it seemed only logical
that I employ your services once again.

You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.

Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time
with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.

Sweet and enjoyable at first, but
ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.

You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe.
I was always a Hubba Bubba man.

Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.

Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.

Gentlemen!

Oh, right. Uh, girlfriend.

(STAMMERS) What are you looking for?

All I'm looking for is an educated,
intelligent woman who shares my interests,

while retaining
her own unique point of view.

She should be kind, patient,
and most important,

unable to imagine life without me
by 10 o'clock tonight.

Isn't that a little unreasonable?

Ah, fine. She doesn't need her own
point of view. Now, chop chop.

Come on, Amy! Show us the dress!

AMY: <i>Okay, but I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.</i>

Uh...

I don't think any of your comfort zones
are showing.

It's your third date,
maybe you could go more sexy.

Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.

No one ever bought me drinks at a bar

because my brain just
popped out of my shirt.

Do you have any heels higher than this?
He's pretty tall.

Ooh, tall! Finally some details
about this mystery man.

Yeah, come on. Tell us more.

Well, I told you his name and that
he's tall. What more do you need?

- Did you kiss him yet?
- Just a little peck on the lips.

(BOTH SQUEAL)

Well, we're your best friends.

Give us one more detail
and we promise we'll leave you alone.

Fine. Um, he's British.

(BOTH SQUEAL)

(CHUCKLING)
All right, that is a juicy one!

All right, where's
Tall British Dave taking you?

Tea and basketball?

- To that new Italian place on Walnut.
- Oh, nice.

- I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
- Oh, good luck.

I threw out all my tall ones
when I married Leonard.

Hey, you wanna swing by that place
tonight and get a look at this guy?

We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.

I'll just call the restaurant, pretend
I'm Amy and check the reservation.

Damn, you're sneaky.

Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.

I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend

is just to get you on
every dating website out there.

Are you sure?
I've heard that on those sites,

often when you think
you're corresponding with someone,

it's actually a computer program
pretending to be a real person.

And you're afraid
it'll do a better job than you?

Excuse me, no one does a better job
pretending to be a person than I do.

Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.

Well, if you don't want to use
dating websites, what do you suggest?

Off the top of my head?

Prospective women
weed themselves out in a battle of wits

until only one champion remains,

she shows up at my door
flush with the thrill of victory,

and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch <i>Daredevil.</i>

You seriously think women
would fight for you?

People compete for jobs and trophies,
why not me?

He's right. He knows a lot of jokes.

No, but it is basic human nature.

If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.

Well, he's smart,
he's a respected scientist.

And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.

- (SCOFFS)
- I don't know if I'd say you... Oh.

I have an idea. What if we put
a post on Craigslist that says,

"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.

"If interested, solve the following
puzzles for a chance to meet him."

Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging

to eliminate unworthy candidates.

Oh, we can set it up like a scavenger hunt

where the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.

This is actually
an interesting social experiment.

I'm a little jealous of the people
who get to do it.

Me, too, and we've seen the prize!

I don't understand why we're leaving
so early for the movie?

Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we're gonna meet up with Bernadette

to spy on Amy and her date. (CHUCKLES)

What? I don't wanna do that.

And you think I wanna see a documentary
about aluminum can recycling?

This is the movie that Big Soda
doesn't want you to see.

Yeah, it's the movie
your wife doesn't want you to see.

So, you're actually okay with invading
your friend's privacy?

- You're not curious who she's out with?
- Not really.

But you're curious about aluminum cans.

You're a weird little guy.

That's it. The Sheldon Cooper
Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.

(CHUCKLES)

- Congratulations.
- This is exciting.

Right now, somewhere,

a woman is dividing the atomic weight
of the best noble gas

by the number of colors
in the oldest national flag still in use--

Then using that number as
the average speed to calculate

- the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
- (CHUCKLES)

And taking her first step towards
a lifetime of laughter,

love and best of all, rules.

I hope we didn't make
the puzzles too hard.

Well, if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,

tenacious and so socially awkward,

she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.

(LAUGHING)

Golly, she sounds too good to be true.

This is fun.
I haven't dated much since my divorce.

Well, I'm having a good time, too.

If you don't mind me asking,
why did you and your wife split up?

Oh, you know how it is,
we wanted different things.

I wanted children, and she wanted
a pastry chef named "Jean-Philippe".

- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

It's why I left England.
It reminded me too much of her.

Cold, gloomy, and easily accessed by
a Frenchman through a tunnel.

- Hey. So, where are they?
- Across the street, in the left window.

Oh, damn it,
we should have brought binoculars.

Right here.

You just happen to have those in the car?

Kind of. Before I met Howie, I liked to
keep close tabs on my boyfriends.

By stalking them?

No, stalkers are creepy.

I'm just a harmless little girl
with military grade spy equipment.

PENNY: <i>Oh, there he is.</i>
BERNADETTE: <i>He's cute, right?</i>

Yeah.

Can I see?

What? Now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.

I know, but you guys make
being a crappy friend look fun.

Fine.

LEONARD: <i>Yeah, okay, I see him.</i>

It looks like they're having a nice time.
I wish I could hear what they're saying.

Yeah, I should have brought
my parabolic microphone.

- Your what?
- Nothing. Not important.

So, you've never been married?

No. To be completely honest, I've only
been in one long-term relationship.

- What happened with that?
- That's a good question.

After five years, it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.

That's too bad.
Was he a neurobiologist like you?

No, he's a theoretical physicist
at CalTech.

I love teaching math,
but that would be my dream job.

What's his focus?

Um, it used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.

But let's not discuss Sheldon,
let's get back to you.

Wait, you're not talking about
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

I'm trying not to.

Do you know him?

No, but I've followed his work for years.
He's a rock star.

You've got to tell me about him.
What's he like?

He really seems into her.

I took a video.
I forgot how much fun this is.

Okay, we saw them.
Can we go catch the movie?

(PENNY EXHALES)

- Why'd you bring him?
- I had to, we're married now.

Ah, I hear that.

I'm sorry,
just one more question about Sheldon.

Sure, why not?

It's more of a four-part question, really.

When he wrote his paper on supersingular
prime numbers, how long did it take?

Um, about an hour and a half.

Wow!

I mean... Wow!
And you were there to see it?

Yes. Yeah, we were on a date.

Very much like this one.

I doubt it was like this one.
I mean, he's a genius.

And I wasn't even smart enough

to figure out why
my wife always smelled of croissants.

What was the rest of your question?

- Do you think you can introduce me to him?
- Really?

You want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?

You're right, it's weird.

No, wait. Do it.

No, I changed my mind, I'd be too nervous.

Oh! I don't know what to do!

Are we gonna be much longer?
I really have to go to the bathroom.

Right here!

37 minutes left until the deadline.

Someone will show.

And no matter what happens,
this was still a fun experiment.

Not as fun as the night
we blew up grapes in the microwave.

We really have led full lives.

Someone will show.

Maybe you don't want someone
exactly like you.

You know what they say, opposites attract.

By that logic, I should be with someone
short, dull, and needy.

Not to cast dispersions, but I can't shake
a stick around here without hitting that.

You know, I once drove 500 miles
to hear him speak at Stanford.

- I have a DVD of that lecture.
- Really? Wasn't it great?

Not as a Valentine's present, no.

Well, the next time you watch it,

I'm the bloke who asked the question
that he said was stupid and obvious.

It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.

That's, um, terrific. Listen, um,
I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?

Oh, gosh. Sorry, I just spent the whole
night talking about your ex-boyfriend.

- I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.

Well, maybe not an idiot.

But certainly not as smart as...
Someone we won't mention.

Thank you.

That you said you might introduce me to.
I'm free on Thursday.

- Hey, they're leaving.
- What? Here, gimme, gimme.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.
They're coming right towards us.

- We gotta get out of here.
- Wait, what about Leonard?

- He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
- (SEATBELT CLICKS)

(ENGINE STARTING)

(BOTH SCREAM)

Oh, no!

She just hit my car!

What are you guys doing here?

Hi, Ames! What're you doing here?

- What happened?
- OMG.

- Aren't you Leonard Hofstadter?
- Yeah?

I saw you speak at Stanford
with Sheldon Cooper.

Amy, can you believe it?
It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!

No, pinch me!

It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?

I don't know if you want to do that,
I was just... Okay, never mind.

- Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.
- You really should.

60 seconds, this is not looking good.

One minute is a long time.

Oh, I've been telling women that
for 20 years.

- 45.
- 45 seconds is plenty of time

for a woman to walk through that door
and fall in love with me.

And probably half that
if I break out the old cow eyes.

30 seconds.

Uh-oh.

- What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?
- What?

Oh, that last <i>Hunger Games</i>
was not my cup of tea.

You thought she was great in <i>X-Men.</i>

Fine, I won't shut my heart
to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.

Guys, 15 seconds.

Maybe she's waiting to show up
at the last possible moment.

Ugh. Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no.
It is Jennifer Lawrence.

Five, four, three, two, one.

That's too bad.

Maybe we did make the test too difficult.

(SIGHS) I don't think it matters.
Look, Sheldon,

I believe when the time is right
for you to meet someone,

it'll just happen, okay?

Not because of a test or a website,
but because--

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

We are the dreamers of dreams!

It's an actual girl
and she's really pretty!

Answer it!

All right.

Can I help you?

Um, are you the physicist
that placed the ad on Craigslist?

- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Vanessa Bennett.

Sorry it took a while for me to get here.
I was stuck in this boring symposium

on atomic spectroscopy
when I came across your ad.

And it saved my night. (CHUCKLES)

<i>The puzzles were really fun.</i>

I've never had to translate Klingon
into ancient Sanskrit before.

Careful, it's addictive.

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

Or as they say in Sanskrit,

(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

And just like that,
you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

Anyway, I just knew
I had to meet the person responsible

for such a brilliant idea.

And I don't need to tell you there aren't
a lot of men who love physics,

archaic languages and flags of the world.

I am a bit of a unicorn.

Well, you certainly seem
like a special lady,

uh, but as you know,
you missed the deadline,

so thanks for playing.

What?

How could you send her away?

She was late.

And she found atomic spectroscopy boring.
I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.

(HANDBRAKE CLICKS)

- Uh, thanks for driving me home.
- No problem.

- I'm really sorry about your car.
- Oh, it's all right.

If you're free next weekend,
I'd love to take you out again.

Um...

Listen, you're a really nice guy,
but I don't think this is working out.

Oh. Okay.

Um... I'm really sorry.

Oh...

At least the same woman
that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.

There ya go. (CHUCKLES)

If I ever do meet him,
we'll have that in common.

Sure. (CHUCKLES)

And he's kissed you and I've kissed you,
so if you think about it--

Okay, get out.

English - SDH

Have you guys seen
this feature that lets you talk to Siri

without pressing any buttons?

No, how does it work?

You just say,
"Hey, Siri, what time is it?"

SIRI: <i>The time is 6:37 p.m.</i>

So now anyone can control your phone?

Hey, Siri, show me pictures
of naked grandma butts!

- Nice try, it only recognizes my voice.
- Oh, cool.

(MIMICS RAJ) Hey, Siri, show me
pictures of naked grandma butts!

(SCOFFS) I don't sound like that.

SIRI: <i>Here are some images
of naked grandma butts.</i>

Hey! Good news, everybody.

Now that I'm no longer with Amy,
I have an extra ticket

to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet
at the aquarium cafeteria.

Who wants it?

You realize you won't be going alone.
I'll be there the whole time.

Providing fish and pilgrim facts.

Can you people hear me?

Well, we're having everyone over.

- Yeah, Leonard and I are cooking all day.
- Otherwise, we'd love to.

- But we can't. Mmm-hmm.
- Poor us.

And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup
kitchen feeding food to the homeless.

Oh, Howard, what about you?

Oh, I can't, I'm going
to the soup kitchen, too.

You said that sounded
like the worst thing ever.

If you can't support me when I'm lying,
why are we married?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

<i>Hi, Sheldon, what's up?</i>

Well, I'm calling because
Thanksgiving is coming up

and I wanted to offer you
the aquarium tickets.

<i>No one can go with you?</i>

No, they'd rather spend the holiday
with each other

than find out if this
is the year I finally touch a starfish.

Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets
to go to waste,

so take whomever you'd like.

<i>Oh?</i>

<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

And feel free to tell your guest
that the Myanmar catfish

is also known as the pilgrim fish.

In case the turkey's dry
and you need something juicy.

<i>Sheldon, I can tell you want to go,</i>

<i>so if you'd be comfortable with it,
maybe we could go as friends.</i>

You don't think that will be awkward?

<i>Well, it is Thanksgiving
in an aquarium cafeteria,</i>

<i>so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say yes.</i>

<i>But if you mean between us,
I think it'll be fine.</i>

Very well, then.
I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.

<i>See you then.</i>

Oh, forget what I said
about the Myanmar catfish.

My list of marine-themed
pilgrim facts is pretty short.

<i>Did you know they served shellfish
and eel at the first Thanksgiving?</i>

And there goes my list.

So, how does this work?

The soup kitchen manager assigns
the jobs and the shifts are six hours.

- (BUZZING)
- Six hours?

(SIGHS) I don't wanna
complain for that long.

Do you ever do anything for anyone else?

I happen to be a giving
and generous lover.

Are you and I close
enough for me to say that's creepy?

We are and I believe the word you're
looking for is... (GROANS IN DISGUST)

- Uh, can I help you?
- Hi, we'd like to volunteer.

Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down,
but we already have enough people.

Any other day, please, come back.
(CHUCKLES)

Oh, okay.

Wipe that smug smile off your face.

Maybe I'm happy that so many people
turned up to help the less fortunate.

(CHUCKLES)

Are you and I close enough for me to say--

That he's an ass? He beat you to it.

Uh, I was wrong.
A large group had to cancel.

Oh, great, we'd love to help!

Wipe that smug smile off your face.

(CHUCKLES) I can't!

Look at us! Our first Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

- I know, I feel so grown up.
- Uh, sweetie, you are grown up.

Really? How many grown-ups do you know
who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?

Hey, the recipes are on my iPad.
Will you pull 'em up?

- Yep. What's the code?
<i>- My birthday.</i>

It's not working.

It's just four digits.
The month and day.

Nope.

Let me see.

Yeah. There.

What number were you putting in?

Uh...

- You don't know my birthday, do you?
- Yes, I do.

- When is it?
- May.

May what?

I'm not gonna say your password out loud,
that is not secure.

You don't know
your own husband's birthday!

- You don't know everything about me.
- Your birthday is December second.

You grew up on Perkin Street.

The last four digits of your social
are seven-six-two-one.

And the odds of me letting
you forget this are zero! (CHUCKLES)

Oh, look at us, our last Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

- Hello.
- Hi.

- Ready for the aquarium?
- I am.

And in an effort to reduce awkwardness
as we learn how to function as friends,

I printed out a list of safe topics
for polite conversation.

If that makes you more comfortable.

If there were a list of things
that make me more comfortable,

lists would be on the top of that list.

Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke,
have you acquired any pets?

No. You?

No.

Um, since last we spoke,
have you planned or gone on any vacations?

I might go visit my aunt next week.

- Your aunt in Modesto?
- No. The one in Bakersfield.

Bakersfield, I see.

Where has this list been all my life?

We're gonna have you washing dishes.

Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here.
Just scrape, wash and stack.

If you need me, I'll be around.

So we don't even get to be
up front where the action is?

What difference does it make?

I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid
would come up to me and say,

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
"Please, sir. I want some more."

You're in a soup kitchen,
not a production of <i>Oliver!</i>

(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.

Then the next day was 73 degrees,
then the day after that was 72,

and then it was 72 again,

then it was 74,
and that brings us to today, at...

I'd wear shorts if I had a pair, 78.

Are we done discussing the weather?

I don't know if I'd call it "discussing,"

you kind of sat back
and let me do all the work.

Let's see what's next on the list. Oh!

Uh, do you whittle,
and if so what kind of knife do you--

Sheldon!
We've known each other a long time.

We are perfectly capable
of having a conversation

without relying
on a list off the Internet.

All right, what should we talk about?

I don't know, just ask me
whatever comes to mind.

Very well.
I know you've been seeing other men.

Have you had coitus with any of them?

Man, I walked right into that one.

Next, we need a teaspoon of pepper,

which I believe was also the name
of your childhood dog.

Fine, you think you know so much?

- Who's my favorite Spice Girl?
- Baby.

- Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?
- Justin.

- Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?
- (SCOFFS) Nice try, NSYNC forever.

Damn it!

(CHUCKLES) Face it, you can't stump me.
I am the king of husbands.

I know you don't like that lingerie
that I got you on Valentine's Day,

I know you hate the word "moist,"
I know you don't--

Hang on, wait, wait.
Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?

Because it's orange and you think
it makes you look like a slutty carrot.

Interesting. I never told you that.

- Sure, you did.
- No, I never told anyone that.

But I did write it in my journal.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) What?

I didn't know you had a journal.

I also know your voice
gets higher when you're lying.

(IN LOW-PITCHED VOICE) No, it doesn't.

- Huh, this reminds me of high school.
- You worked in a restaurant?

No, I was in India.
It was humid and smelled funny.

All right, I think I'm getting
into a groove here. This isn't so bad.

Yeah, only five hours
and 40 minutes to go.

We've only been doing this 20 minutes?

You know, I read that washing dishes
can be an excellent form of meditation.

The key is that while washing the dishes,
one should only be "washing the dishes."

Just because you have that accent
doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.

No, seriously,
it's about being present in the moment.

Focusing on the feeling of the warm water.
The smell of the detergent,

the sound of the dishes squeaking
and following your own breath.

It's about simply being.

Huh? (CHUCKLES)

Okay, I'll try it.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

- I need three people out front.
- I'll do it!

RAJ: Me!
EMILY: Right here!

No fair, I was meditating!

Oh, come on, don't be mad.

It was a long time ago
and it was an accident.

How can reading my journal be an accident?

I didn't even know what it was. I saw it
on your nightstand, I picked it up.

Well, when you realized what it was,
why didn't you stop?

(SCOFFS) You know me,
I'm a big ol' bookworm.

- Let's just finish cooking.
- (STUTTERING)

Let me make this up to you.

Sometimes, I keep an online journal.
I want you to read something that I wrote.

Really, I'm fine.

Uh, okay, then I'll just read it to you.
It's from the day that we first met.

(CLEARS THROAT)

- "Beauty, thy name is Penny--"
- Oh, God, stop.

I don't want you to read
something you think'll just butter me up.

I wanna hear
the most recent thing you wrote.

Fine.

(HUMMING AWKWARDLY)

"Penny's beauty, like our love,
grows more with each passing day."

Does it really say that?

Why would I lie?

"OMG, OMG, We're so close to
the new <i>Star Wars</i>. I can't take it. Gah."

"Gah"?

Well you didn't read it right.
The new <i>Star Wars</i> is coming, gah!

I'm sensing things have gotten awkward.

No, it's okay.

If we're friends,
we should be able to talk about anything.

All right.

So, you had some questions
about me seeing other people.

- Just a few.
- Go ahead.

How many dates have you been on?
Who were they with?

Where did you go? Where did you meet them?
Did you sleep with them?

And how much longer to the aquarium?
I'm getting kind of hungry.

Let's see... (SIGHS)

I've been on six dates
with three different people.

It was either for coffee or dinner.

One I met at a bookstore
and two I met online.

I haven't slept with anyone,
the aquarium is 40 minutes away,

and there's a baggie of Cheerios for you
in the glove compartment.

Is that regular or Honey Nut?

I mixed them.

You mixed them. No wonder gentleman
callers are pounding down your door.

Do you have any questions for me?

Just one.

Are you doing okay?

I am.

<i>Good.</i>

(STUTTERS) I want you to be happy.

I believe you.

I'd believe you more if you threw
a few Apple Jacks in here.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

You gotta be kidding me.

Sorry?

- (SHUDDERING) You're Elon Musk.
- I am.

(STUTTERING) What are you doing here?

I'm washing dishes.

Well, I was on the turkey line,
but I got demoted

for being too generous with the gravy.

Oh, man... (CHUCKLING)
What an honor to meet you.

(GASPS) I'm such a fan of Tesla
and SpaceX. All your companies.

- Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
- Nice to meet you, Howard.

Feels great to come down here
and help the less fortunate, huh?

Oh, yeah.

Nothing better than helping people.

Which is something I realized
when I was viewing Earth

from the deck
of the International Space Station

where I spent two months
as a payload specialist,

a job I was qualified for
because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.

Sorry. It's just... You're you...
(CHUCKLES)

And I really want you to adopt me.

Well, you're here on Thanksgiving,
so you're probably a good person.

Oh, I made my wife come down, too.

You think you might ever
get back out to space?

Is that a job offer?
'Cause I really wanna go to Mars.

Assuming I can bring my wife.

She hardly takes up any room.
She's basically a carry-on.

Well, we're not quite there yet,
but we're always looking for engineers.

So let me give you my email,
we can stay in touch.

Thank you.

(HOWARD GASPS)

Oh, look.

Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.
Want to share it with me?

A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie
from a homeless shelter?

With Elon Musk? You bet I do!

You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an
aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.

You're just upset
'cause they ran out of pilgrim hats.

They gave one to that baby,
he wasn't even awake.

Well, it wouldn't be a holiday
without you being mad at a baby.

Oh, would you care to play
an ocean-themed game I invented?

- Sure, what is it?
- It's called Food, Friend, Fight.

One of us chooses three aquatic creatures
and the other one must decide

which he would eat, befriend, or battle.

So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

What is that?

It's a game where
you're given three people

and you choose
which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

Well, my game is better because instead
of marrying someone, you get to eat them.

Let's just play.

I'll start you off easy.
Electric eel, puffer fish, shrimp.

Hmm.

Well, I wouldn't fight the eel

because I know it can generate
enough current to kill a horse.

So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp,
and befriend the puffer fish

because it would be nice to have
company on those days I feel bloated.

- Very well done.
- Thank you.

Okay, your turn.

Um... Seal, hagfish...

SpongeBob SquarePants.

Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob, but he's not
real, so I can't do that, can I?

But you can pal around with a hagfish?

Hey, let's not pull at that thread.

Okay, I'll fight SpongeBob.

Because he's so friendly,
we'll just end up tickling each other.

Um, I'll befriend the seal
because he's trainable,

which was the problem I'm having
with my current friends.

Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.

Isn't that gross?

A hagfish can produce enough mucus
to fill a bucket in a minute.

I know. It makes its own gravy,
it'll slide right down.

I miss this.

How can you miss a game
you've never played before, silly?

(AMY CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Guess sometimes I'm silly.

Hey, where'd you go?
I can't tell if the turkey's done.

LEONARD: <i>Be right there.</i>

- Hi, lover.
- (GASPS)

What are you doing?

I'm sorry about the journal
and I want to make it up to you,

so I'm going to let you post
a shame photo of me on Facebook.

I am not putting that on the Internet!
I don't want people to see this.

I don't want to see it!

(CHUCKLES) You don't want people
to see what, huh? A little bit of this?

Oh...

Some of this?

And since it's Thanksgiving,
an extra helping of this.

Happy Thanks--

I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.

Uh-- Me, too. It's comforting to know that
she and I are able to function as friends.

Well, I've never been friends
with any of my exes.

Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard
will be able to pull it off.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, it's my friend Amy.

- Hello.
- Hi, Sheldon

I'm just driving home from my mother's.

<i>- Did you have a nice time?</i>
- I did.

Um...

Listen, I really enjoyed
spending this morning with you.

Oh, well, I can't take all the credit.

It was pretty funny when that one
anchovy started going the wrong way.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

It was. Uh, listen...

I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready
to be your girlfriend again.

Oh?

I thought we were just friends.

We are. But I was hoping, maybe--

Amy, I excel at many things,
but getting over you wasn't one of them.

I think I need to just be your friend.

Okay. I understand.

SHELDON: <i>Good.</i>

<i>Oh, I watched a video
of the hagfish producing mucus,</i>

<i>so I'm going to change
my answer and eat SpongeBob.</i>

(SHAKILY) Okay, sure.

English - SDH

<i>Sheldon Cooper's descent
into madness. Day two.</i>

<i>It's 2:25 a.m.
and I feel the urge to urinate.</i>

<i>My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m.</i>

<i>But here I am, in the middle of the night,
struggling to keep my mind sharp,</i>

<i>and my pajamas dry.</i>

<i>It's only a matter of time
before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.</i>

<i>I suppose I should pee
while I still know what a toilet is.</i>

(SHELDON HUMMING)

- Since when do you hum songs?
- What are you talking about?

- You were just humming.
- Are you sure?

Sometimes, when my brain
really gets moving, it makes noise.

How does your brain feel about calculating
the surface tension of the domain walls?

Let's see.

(CONTINUES HUMMING) Hey, I was humming.

One point for Hufflepuff.

- What song is that?
- Well... Hum it again.

(SHELDON HUMMING AGAIN)

Is that the <i>SpongeBob</i> song?

(SINGING
THE <i>SPONGEBOB</i> SONG)

(No.

Whatever, can we just get back to this?

I feel like I know what song that is,
but I can't put my finger on it.

(SINGING)

No.

It's just an earworm, it'll come to you.

Okay.

(SHELDON SINGING AGAIN)

No.

Is this what we're doing
the rest of the night?

(SINGING) <i>I'm surprised you have to ask</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Hello, yes, I'm hoping you can help me.
What song is this?

(SINGING) <i>La la la la la la la</i>

You don't know? How dare you call
yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

My goodness, do you sing along
to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley

with that mouth?

Well, they were no help at all.

Which is crazy since rock and roll
is all about good customer service.

Yeah, so you have a song stuck
in your head. It happens to everybody.

Yeah, well, I'm not everybody,
I have an eidetic memory.

I should be able to remember
what this song is, but I can't.

Something's wrong with me.

I told you if we were patient,
he'd figure it out for himself.

Oh, I was always afraid
this day would come.

This might be the first step
of my descent into madness.

Where I gradually test the limits
of public nudity.

- Public nudity?
- Yeah, that just means going barefoot.

- DAVE: <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi, Dave. Uh, it's Amy.

<i>- Oh, how are you?</i>
- I'm fine, how are you?

Terrific, and pleasantly surprised
to hear from you,

given how I acted on our last date.

Yeah, well, we both made mistakes.
You know, I took the last breadstick,

you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

like he was Leonard Nimoy
and you were my ex-boyfriend.

So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

Well, I was wondering if you'd like
to get dinner again sometime?

Yes, please.

Uh, great.

"Let me just check my schedule," he said,

trying to seem like a man
with things on his schedule.

- How about Saturday?
<i>- Uh...</i>

Let me see.
Uh, Friday, farmer's market with Jay-Z.

Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John,
Saturday works.

Uh! Did you know, at the United Nations,

there's a department
for Outer Space Affairs?

Really? Why?

They exist in case we ever make contact
with an alien civilization.

Oh, boy, that's one of those jobs
that's boring, boring, boring,

then, "Oh, God! Where's the memo
with what we do now?"

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, this is cool.

So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page
on Facebook for our band and I--

Wait a second, how could you do that
without consulting me?

It's not a big deal.
Just took, like, five minutes to set up.

That's not the point.

When we created Footprints on the Moon,

we agreed that every band decision
would be mutual.

Now you're just trying
to take over the whole thing.

You know, maybe I should go solo.

But someone joined our page.
We have an actual fan.

All right, this thing's bigger than you
and me, band's back together.

So, listen to what he wrote.

"Uh, I saw you play at the
comic book store. You guys rock."

And then there's an animated smiley face
raising the roof like this...

- We did raise the roof that night.
- Yeah, we totally did.

I mean, why do rock stars do drugs
when this feels so great?

(SINGING) <i>Why can't I recall this song?</i>

<i>This is taking far too long</i>

<i>The urge to bang my head against the wall</i>

<i>again and again and again
and again and again is strong</i>

Put on some headphones.

(SINGING) <i>No, they make my earlobes sweat</i>

Hey, sweetie, what don't you take a break,
and do something else for a while?

There was a project
I've been thinking about starting.

- Okay, great. What is it?
- I'll show you.

<i>Dear crazy, future Sheldon,
you were driven mad by an earworm.</i>

<i>Your mind, once your most trusted asset,
is now a sack of parrots and monkeys.</i>

<i>So, I'm going to tell you everything
you need to know.</i>

<i>Uh, first, music is dangerous,</i>

<i>the movie</i> Footloose <i>tried to warn us,
but we wouldn't listen.</i>

<i>Oh, wait!</i>

(SINGING)

No.

I would pay $1000
to watch you cut footloose.

SHELDON: <i>This is Penny.</i>

<i>She is your friend.</i>

<i>If she offers you food, it's safe to
take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.</i>

So, you're really going out
with Dave again?

Why not? He's actually a very nice guy.

He spent an entire date talking
about how much he loves Sheldon.

It's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before.

Dave's just a big fan of his work.

Besides, he said
he wouldn't bring it up again.

Okay, so where's he taking you?

Oh, he's coming here.
I'm actually making dinner.

- That's a big step.
- It is?

Yeah. You're inviting him into your home.
It's intimate.

It's where your underpants live.

You know what? Good.

I mean, I tried to get back together
with Sheldon, he shot me down.

Dave likes me.
Maybe intimate is what I need.

Are you sure?
You've never really been with a man.

Do you really want to start
with one that's 6'7"?

Why not?

'Cause it's like taking
your driver's test in a bus.

Maybe we should post a comment
back to our fan and thank him.

What should we write?

How about... Oh, how about,

"We might be Footprints on the Moon, but
your kind words sent us over the moon."

Someday, you're gonna make
an amazing grandma.

What do you wanna write?

Something badass. You know, like,

"Thanks for diggin' our vibe.
We'll keep rockin' if you keep rollin'."

Dude, if I was wearing a bra,
I'd throw it at your head right now.

I'll keep rockin', you don't do that.

Okay. I posted it.

So, who is this guy?

- Let's see, his name is Trent Monaco.
- Cool name.

Yeah. He's 24. He's a DJ.
He brews his own beer.

He's got awesome tattoos.
Dude, he's got a hot girlfriend, too.

Damn, I don't know
if he's our biggest fan or I'm his.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Hey, Trent just liked our comment.

He is so cool! No hard feelings, but
I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.

(SHELDON PLAYING KEYBOARD)

Oh, my God, he won't stop.

How does he keep coming up
with new ways to be annoying?

Nobody knows, that's why he's number one.

Can you please go talk to him?

Oh, come on, I take care of him
all day long. You do it for once!

Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?

What do you want, a medal?
It was your gum.

Fine.

- I love you.
- Who cares?

SHELDON: <i>What are you doing in my room?
I-- Stop it, that's mine!</i>

<i>Why are you so strong?</i>

Problem solved.

Oh!

(SHELDON PLAYING TUBA)

Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.

<i>Dear crazy, future Sheldon,</i>

<i>this is a thermostat.</i>

It controls the temperature
of the apartment.

<i>The ideal setting is 72 degrees.</i>

<i>If you find this too cold,
then put on a jacket.</i>

<i>A straightjacket,
'cause 72's the best and you're crazy.</i>

Now, this is your spot.

You're very protective of it.

When anyone else tries to sit here,
you berate them relentlessly.

<i>And it sounds mean,
but somehow, you make it adorable.</i>

<i>People are also delighted
by your love of pranks.</i>

<i>For example, Leonard has no idea
what I did to his coffee.</i>

<i>It wasn't replace it with Folgers
crystals, I'll tell you that much.</i>

Hey, can we please get back to work?

This is Leonard.
He's your best friend in the world.

<i>Just stop, this is ridiculous.</i>

<i>Sometimes he gets cranky,</i>

<i>but you can trust him with your life.</i>

And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

Thank you.

Oh, no, he's drinking it!

Look at this.
Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.

That is so cool!

Old broken things are so much better
than new things that work.

- Who's Trent?
- Oh, he's our fan.

Fan of what?

Uh, did you forget? We're in a band.

You mean, because you played one time
in the comic book store?

And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

Hey, dude, Trent just checked in
at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

Really? You wanna go down there
and meet him?

Are you stalking him? That's creepy.

It's not creepy. I built the Footprints
on the Moon fan page. Trent joined it.

After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

go back in the archive of his feed
until I found his Twitter handle.

From there it was easy
to find him on Instagram,

Snapchat and pretty much track
his every movement.

So, if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

Maybe I should marry Trent.

Yeah. Like she could get Trent.

(CHUCKLING)

- This is delicious.
- Thank you.

Been a long time
since I had a home-cooked meal.

When you were married,
did your wife cook?

Uh, not at first, no.

But when she started cheating on me
with the French chef,

she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.

- So, a little silver lining.
- I suppose. Yeah.

Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

like a properly seasoned bowl
of onion soup.

- How long have you lived here?
- Uh...

About five years. I'm actually thinking
about moving to a better place,

now that I don't need to be so close to--

- Well, you know. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
- I do.

The brilliant physicist that I now know
lives in the area. Not that I care.

Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive, so
I pretty much had to take him everywhere.

Had to or got to?

Sorry.

- My fault, I brought him up.
- Yeah.

Well, let's change the subject.
No more mentions of you-know-who.

That's a cool train.
Where did you get that?

(HUMMING)

(GARGLING)

This song is never going to stop.

Have you ever dealt with something
so relentlessly irritating?

That's a trick question, right?

Now, I shouldn't be surprised.

There's a rich history of brilliant minds
descending into madness.

Come on, Sheldon,
there are plenty of smart people

who don't have mental problems.

Yeah, she's right. For every Newton
who had a psychological issue,

there's an Edison who was just a jerk.
That could totally be you.

Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

You know, Pythagoras had
an irrational fear of beans.

Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon
who he claimed loved him back.

Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.

The list extends outside of science.
Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock.

Chess champion Bobby Fischer.
Brian Wilson of The Beach--

(<i>DARLIN'</i> PLAYING)

I remember the song! It's called <i>Darlin'</i>
by The Beach Boys! Thank goodness!

I'm not crazy! I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

There goes our shot
at him living on the roof.

All right, there he is.

- So, should we introduce ourselves?
- No, let him spot us.

I wonder if he's listening
to our music right now.

Could you imagine?
What a cool way for us to meet.

He's playing our song
and looks up and there we are.

His favorite two-piece
acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.

And he's all, like, "Aren't you the guys
from Footprints on the Moon..."

Ooh! What is he doing?

- I can't watch.
- It's okay. Oh, it's okay, he's done.

Why is he looking at it?

No, he's not going to eat it, is he?

Come on, Trent, you're better than--

BOTH: No!

Let's just go.

Hey, aren't you the guys from--

- Nope!
- Never heard of them!

<i>(DARLIN'</i> PLAYING)

I wonder why it was this particular song
that was stuck in my head.

I don't know, it's pretty catchy.

Yeah, do you even like The Beach Boys?

They have "beach" right in the name,
what do you think?

Well, now that you can focus again,

what do you say we get back
to surface tension of domain walls?

Of course, I'm already seeing
a more efficient way of taming the--

I know why the song was in my head.

- Why?
- It's about Amy.

Okay, look. I know Amy's like an old lady,

but she's not old enough to have a song
from the '60s written about her.

It's about how she made my life better.
Consider the lyrics.

(READING OUT LYRICS)

She did soften your life, didn't she?

Yes! She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

I have to go.

Aw.

Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?

Better. You're the lint trap of my love.

- That's an interesting tie clip.
- Oh, thanks. It's Avogadro's constant.

It's useful for calculating the number
of atoms in a substance,

or causing regret in anyone
who asks about it.

No, I think it's neat. (CHUCKLES)

- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry!

No one's ever liked the tie clip before,
so I just lost all control. I...

No, it's okay,
and we are on a date. I'm...

I'm just a little nervous.

Well, no need to be nervous with me.

I'm just a harmless giant
from a foreign land.

You know, I'm just being silly. I...

I don't know what I'm waiting for.

- (KNOCK ON THE DOOR)
- SHELDON: Amy. Amy. Amy.

- That's Sheldon.
- You're kidding! How's my hair?

Sheldon, this isn't a good time.

I don't care. Amy, there was a song
I couldn't get out of my head.

Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

and like that earworm,
I can't get you out of my heart.

So, what I'm trying to say is,

you're my heartworm.

The metaphorical kind,
not the poodle-killing kind.

What?

If I may.

I believe what he's saying,
in a charming and delightful way,

is that he loves you and wants you back.

Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work.
Don't mind me.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were on a date.

No, it's okay, keep going.

Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend
again, I really want to be your boyfriend.

I really want that, too.

Good.

Because I love you.

I love you, too.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

Kiss her, you brilliant fool!

Well...

I'll let you get back to your date.

Get back here.

Okay, then.

I'll, uh, see myself out.

Amy, thank you for dinner.

Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir.

Uh, if, perhaps, sometime,
you have a spare moment,

I'd love to discuss physics
or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say.

Oh! What a lovely evening!

(<i>STAR WARS</i> THEME
MUSIC PLAYING)

- Guys, tickets already went on sale!
- What?

They're not supposed to be available yet.

I don't know what to tell you,
but they're on sale!

(STAMMERS) Wait. Are you sure
they're <i>Star Wars</i> tickets?

No, it's <i>Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.</i>

The website's frozen. I can't get in!

- LEONARD: Yeah, me, too.
- Same here.

- Guys, they're gonna sell out!
- What are we gonna do?

All right, this goes
against everything I stand for,

but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

Lord...

This is Sheldon Cooper.

You're good friends with my mom.

I know I've spent my life
denying that you exist.

- Got 'em!
- Yeah, and I will continue to do so!

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

I'm really happy
you and Amy are back together.

Thank you.

I'm also really happy,
but I can't pretend it's for you.

New <i>Star Wars</i> in three days! (CHUCKLES)

Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.

I'm taking off work
to watch the original trilogy

while I eat enough <i>Star Wars</i>
cereal to choke a Wookiee.

Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.

Yeah, and you do realize
I bought my ticket

when Amy and I were broken up?

I hope you didn't
need anything in that case,

'cause it's closed.

You guys just got back together.

You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.

I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.

But someone might spoil the movie.

No, no one can spoil
Amy's birthday for me.

Surprise! She's even older.
Who saw that coming?

Aw! That's nice. Put that on her cake.

Oh, great. This again.

Arthur? What brings you back?

Beats me. I just

hope this isn't a sex dream.

In the past, you've come to me
when I'm struggling with a dilemma.

And... And the one time where...
Where you were afraid,

and you needed me for...
For a night light.

What's... What's troubling you?

Well...

My friends are telling me

I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend
on her birthday

to see the new <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

Well, sounds right.

Can... Can I get out of this mumu now?

Those are the robes of the Jedi,

the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.

And they... They...
They don't wear underwear.

So, you agree with my friends
that I should skip the premiere?

Do... Do you love this girl?

Yes.

But she knows
how important <i>Star Wars</i> is to me.

Well, maybe you should show her how...

How important she is to you.

By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?

Sheldon, you can see this movie
whenever you want.

But you only have a limited number of days

that you can be with this woman.

Be with her.

You're right.

Great.

Where are you going?

I don't know,

but, hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Sheldon, what's wrong?

I wanted to let you know
I'll be spending your birthday with you.

Okay.

See, I had tickets
to the <i>Star Wars</i> premiere that night,

<i>but Professor Proton
came to me in a dream,</i>

dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and convinced me I should be with you.

Obi-what?

I'll let you get back to sleep now.
Good night.

Okay. Good night. Wait... Sheldon,

were you actually not gonna
spend my birthday with me?

(YAWNING) It's late. Got to go. Bye.

Good for Sheldon deciding

- to stay with Amy on her birthday.
- I know.

It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.

Well, we could wait a couple of days
and see it together.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hello.

Hey. We're going to the comic book store.
You want to come?

No, I can't.

I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.

Which leads me
to the following bit of business.

This is my ticket to <i>Star Wars.</i>

I don't have to tell you

it is worth far more
than its face value of $15.50.

I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.

You got it.

Well, Penny might want to join us--

This is my ticket to <i>Star Wars.</i>

- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- SHELDON: <i>Penny? Penny? Penny?</i>

What happens if I say, "Come in"?

Well, find out.

Come in!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

SHELDON: <i>Bernadette?
Bernadette? Bernadette?</i>

Come in!

<i>Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.</i>

Just come in.

For future reference,
if I want to watch <i>Mean Girls,</i>

I'll stream it on Netflix.

We're sorry. What do you need?

Well, as you know,

I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,

and I could use your assistance
in helping me select the perfect gift.

- Sure.
- Well, so far,

I've come up with three ideas.

The first is a chance for her

to play the harp
with the LA Philharmonic.

Wow. You can really arrange that?

Well, I said a chance, you know.

When you tell them it's your birthday
at Bennigan's, they make a fuss.

I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.

How about
something a little more realistic?

Well, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters.

So, I was thinking
of getting her an all-expense-paid trip

to the Wisconsin Sheep & Wool Festival.

Sorry. I was waiting for the "bazinga."

Hold on. It could be romantic.

The two of them away together,

keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.

No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone.

But if you think I'm afraid of birds,
you should see me around sheep.

Okay, well, what's the third option?

That I have coitus with her.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

What do you think about
giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

I don't know.

Have you ever
seen a movie with Stuart before?

It's like going with your grandpa.

Instead of eating popcorn,

he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware

and a thermos full of soup.

He's not that bad.

Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?

My... My doctor's worried
about my circulation,

so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.

Why?

- Well--
- Hey, you guys.

Make sure to wear sensible shoes.

Wil, want to go to <i>Star Wars,</i> Thursday?

Absolutely.

Fine. Take Wil.

See if he brings you clam chowder.

Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay...

Let's... Let's...
Let's just recap our options.

All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...

Wild thing.

Which do you think she'd prefer?

Because I checked
the Sheep and Wool Festival website,

and there's only 8,000 tickets left.

Okay. Sheldon, being physical with Amy
is a <i>huge</i> step for you.

Yeah, are you ready for this?

Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,

but I'd like to show her
how important she is,

and it feels like
now might be the right time.

Sheldon, that's so beautiful.

Then it's settled.

Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.

Thanks for taking me out.

Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

Why not celebrate early?

So, where do you want to go?

I heard that new Mexican place
on Greene Street is good.

Sure, sure.

Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.

Why would I get a bikini wax
for my birthday?

(STAMMERS) I don't know.
It was just a thought.

I think I'll just stick to Mexican.

Great.

And then, maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,

and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,

we can answer them.

Okay, what is going on?

We just want you to be prepared

for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

What surprises?

(EXHALES)

We don't want to spoil anything,

but you should know that
Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.

You shut your damn mouth!

You actually heard him say this?

Yes. He said he wants to do something
to show you how much you mean to him.

(EXHALES)

I... I can't believe it. I...

I don't know what to say.

Well, we're really happy for you,
and we know how much he cares--

I do know what to say! Let's get me waxed!

Why isn't it ever
Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

You're back.

It... It doesn't seem like it's up to me.

I suppose you're here

because I've decided
to be physical with my girlfriend,

and I've never done that before.

Excuse me for a moment.

(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

Well, it was worth a shot.

So, can you help me?

Uh, all right, um...

Once... Once the man gets

the woman out of her...
Out of her bloomers...

No. Not that.

I... I understand the mechanics.

Oh, good. Good. 'Cause

I have no idea what kids these days

are calling their... Their parts.

I think they say "junk."

What is happening to this world?

What... What do you
actually need to know?

This is an important night for us,

and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed
and ruin everything.

(SIGHS) Sheldon,
if you're with the right person,

it'll be okay.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Thank you, Arthur.

You are the wisest of the wise.

Well, that's...
That's very nice of you to say,

but I think I'm just an expression of...

Of your unconscious mind.

Oh, sure.

Well, you're fun to look at.

Tonight's the night!

Yeah, the wait is finally over!

I know.
Then you'll finally stop talking about it!

- Ready to go?
- Let's do this.

- Have fun, guys!
- We will.

- I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.
- I know.

We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

No, they're not.

Knowing them, they will.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

- T-minus 15 minutes!
- (ALL CHUCKLING)

- Oh, did you hear from Wil?
- Yeah, he's on his way.

Time for bladder check.

Check.

- Check.
- Check.

Wait.

Screw it. I'm holding it.

(PEOPLE BOOING)

What is everyone booing at?

Hey, guys. What's up?

Uh... Hey, Wil. What you doin'?

I was on <i>Star Trek.</i>
Just rooting for the home team.

MAN: Star Trek <i>stinks!</i>

Yeah? Live long and suck it!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

SHELDON: <i>Birthday girl?
Birthday girl? Birthday girl?</i>

Come in!

Oh!

- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hello.

Sorry I'm late.

I also got you a balloon,

but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.

That's okay. Come on in.

Thank you.

Um, I'll just... I'm gonna go
put these in water.

Okay.

Oh! This is different.

Hmm. Candles and music.

Do you like it?

It's kind of spooky.

I can change it back.

No, no, no. It's your birthday.

And as long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

So...

What'd you have in mind for tonight?

I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.

Now, if we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.

Um, that sounds nice,

but I'm not really hungry right now.

I thought, maybe,

- we could do presents first.
- Oh!

All right. Um...

I should probably tell you
something about this gift.

You mean, before you...

Give it to me?

Yes.

May I ask you a question before I...

Give it to you?

- Of course.
- Why are we saying

"give it to you" like that?

Sheldon,

I know your present is

for us to be intimate tonight.

I see.

Is that all right?

I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

I'm gonna need verbal consent.

Yes.

You know what, let me
pull a quick contract off the Internet--

So, if you don't like <i>Star Wars,</i>
why are you here?

Oh, I'm just having fun.

Everyone takes <i>Star Wars</i> so seriously.

Like if the movie's bad,
it's gonna ruin their lives.

Is it bad? Did you hear something?

Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.

See? That's what I mean.

When you wake up in the morning,

whether this is the greatest movie ever
or a total piece of crap,

your life isn't gonna change at all.

He's right.

Yeah.

No matter what happens,

we're coming back tomorrow
to watch it again.

Do you think Sheldon's actually
gonna go through with it?

I don't know. He said he's ready.

Yeah, but he also swore this was the year

he'd be able to
pull the guts out of a pumpkin.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna stay positive.

I mean, we talked.
I told him what women like.

And after he stopped giggling,
he seemed pretty sure of himself.

(CHUCKLES) Hi.

Hello.

So, um...

Should I get under the covers with you?

All right.

- Hello--
- Hi!

Why are you shaking? Are you cold?

I'm just... (EXHALES) Really nervous.

Why?

Well,

I've been waiting for this for so long,

I've just built it up in my head.

I don't know what to expect.

Neither do I.

But, we can find out together.

Okay.

I'm really nervous.

I know.

We've been waiting so long for this.

And we've built it up
in our heads so much.

Guys, it's just a movie.

- That's true.
- He's right.

- It is.
- (CHUCKLES)

Although, we all remember Jar Jar.

Leonard, I'm scared again.

Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

Me, too.

I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

That works for me!

I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

I don't think I can walk right now.

ARTHUR: <i>Sheldon?</i>

Sheldon.

Arthur.

What are you doing here?

I... I... I don't think
I need any more advice.

I... I was just curious.

How did it go?

It was amazing.

I... I saw it a few days later.

What a movie.

But, what... What about Amy?

Oh! Uh...

She liked it fine.

Yeah, but she doesn't have the history
with the franchise I do.

Okay.

Good... Good talk.

English - SDH

I'm glad to see you made it safely.

How's your hotel?

<i>It's not the best
Best Western I've been to,</i>

<i>but I'd say</i>

<i>it's the third-best
Best Western I've been to.</i>

I know how you feel.

The Best Buy by my house
is only the third-best Best Buy.

They have the best buys,
but having the best buys

isn't the only thing
that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.

<i>What makes a best Best Buy
the best Best Buy?</i>

Hmm. That's a great question.

I like when they're next to a Chipotle.

<i>Okay, well, I should unpack.</i>

All right.
Enjoy the neurobiology conference.

<i>I will.</i>

<i>I wish you were here.</i>

At a neurobiology conference?
What a mean thing to say.

<i>Okay, I'm glad you're not here?</i>

Aww. You always know just what to say
after I tell you what to say.

<i>Good-bye, Sheldon.</i>

- Bye.
- (BEEPS)

Oh! Good news, gentlemen.

Amy's at a conference this weekend,

which means I'm available
to be entertained.

As today's youth might put it,
who wants to get their Sheld-on?

Bernie and I are getting the house ready
for the remodel.

We could always use
an extra pair of hands.

That sounds awful. Raj?

Uh, I've got time booked
in the telescope room all weekend

scanning for rogue planets.

You're more than welcome to join me.

That's the one to beat. Leonard?

Oh. If anything,
I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.

Well, then, it looks like
we have a winner. Congratulations.

Well, I should warn you,
it's just looking at data

for hours and hours on a computer screen.

Stop selling it, kid. You won.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

- Hey.
- Hello.

Hi. How was your day?

Uh, not good.
Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.

A doctor? (GRUNTS)

Well, I hope you're not contagious.

I've got a weekend in the telescope room

I've been excited about
for almost three minutes.

I'm not sick. It's for work.

There's this doctor
who refuses to see any sales reps.

I've been trying to get in for months.

Well, did you try wearing the shirt
I said was inappropriate for work?

Well, the doctor's a woman,

but yes, because you never know.

What kind of doctor is she?

Um. A psychiatrist. Why?

Well, what if you make
an appointment as a patient?

Then you'll get to talk to her.

Yeah, they already know
I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

Oh, what if Leonard made an appointment
and tried to lay some groundwork for you?

That's interesting.

Well, I'm not gonna make
a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.

What would I say is wrong with me?

- Low self-esteem.
- Social anxiety.

Sexual insecurity.

None of that is true.

Denial. See, sweetie,
the list goes on and on.

This is crazy.

How would my going in there even help you?

I don't know. You could talk to her,
and maybe if it comes up,

you could ask if she's heard
about the drug.

(SCOFFS) What if I get caught?

- Fear of failure!
- Lack of confidence!

Kind of a wuss!

Fine, I'll do it.

But not because of them,
because I love you.

Thank you.

- Pushover.
- Spineless.

Still hasn't bought milk
even though I told him two days ago!

(EXHALES)

- That was incredible.
- (CHUCKLES)

It was.

I just wish Stuart wasn't around
so we didn't have to be so quiet.

I know.

It's not like he returns the favor

when he watches
his Japanese porn cartoons.

- (CHUCKLES)
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

STUART: <i>You guys got a minute,
or are you still cuddling?</i>

(MOUTHING) Oh, my God!

What is it, Stuart?

<i>- Can I come in?</i>
- Hang on.

Should I send him away?

No, it's okay.

STUART: <i>Thanks, Bernie.</i>

What's up?

Uh... Well, I know

the remodel is coming up,

so I thought I'd make it easy
on you guys and find my own place.

Wow. (CHUCKLES)

I thought I was done
getting lucky tonight.

So, when are you thinking of moving?

Uh, actually,
I already found an apartment,

so in a couple of days.

Oh. Okay.

Sorry to see you go?

Okay, well, thank you guys for everything.

(STAMMERS) I really appreciate it.

You're very welcome.

Hmm.

What?

Hmm, I just have never been in this room
while you're awake.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

What are you doing?

(SIGHS) Making sure the telescope's camera
is white-field balanced.

Hmm.

What are you doing now?

Still making sure the telescope's camera
is white-field balanced.

Oh, I see.

(SNIFFS)

How about now?

Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera
is white-field balanced

and wishing you had a coloring book.

Well, I can be helpful.
Give me something to do.

You know, my father took me to work once,

and in ten minutes I figured out

who'd been stealing
from the cash register.

It was my father.

Yeah, Dad lost his job,

but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.

Fine, you want something to do?

There's about six months of data
on this hard drive.

Why don't you go through it
and see if you can spot

any patterns or anomalies?

Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that!

An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job
to a white fella.

(CHUCKLES)

Yeah, okay, whatever it takes
to keep you busy for a few hours.

Found one.

No, you didn't.

There are millions of data points there.

But, look, an optical transient.

Yeah, maybe that is something.

- How did you find that?
- It wasn't difficult.

You know how when you see
prime numbers, they appear red,

but when they're twin primes,

they're pink and smell like gasoline?

No.

Oh.

I guess I'm a special boy.

You know, sometimes when a boy is special,

he gets a Fudgsicle.

Which, by the way,
tastes like the speed of light.

Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

Ah! It's my pleasure. I'm curious,

are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?

Uh... She's my mother. You know her?

No, not personally,

but I have read all of her books.

Well, then you know her better than I do.

(CHUCKLES)

Well, I'm not so sure about that.

But I can tell you I do not agree
with her theories on child rearing at all.

Really?

Any chance you find them
cold, cruel, and unsuitable

for innocent little boys
who just want to be happy?

Well, I didn't want to say it...

No, no, say it. Sing it.

Rent a plane, write it in the sky.

Sounds like you're holding on
to quite a bit of anger towards her.

No, I've worked through
a lot of that stuff. I'm better now.

Hmm. Good for you.

Do you know she never let me
celebrate my birthday

because being born
was her achievement, not mine?

That's heartbreaking.

Right? To this day,
I send her a card every year

with a little money in it.

You know, once we get
the house back to ourselves,

we can be romantic in any room we want.

Great. I can finally show you
where the laundry room is.

Boy, who would've thought

when you asked me to move in
and help take care of your mom,

I'd still be here two years later?

- No one.
- Nobody thought that.

Well, that's it.

I guess so.

This is weird.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah. A grown man
moving into his own apartment.

It's crazy times. See ya!

Ignore him.

He's just using humor to express
how happy he is.

It's okay. I know he loves me.

Sure he does.

Well, let us know
when you're all settled in.

I will. And I really can't
thank you guys enough.

- (ENGINE STARTS)
- Our pleasure.

- Bye.
- Good luck!

HOWARD: <i>He's gone!</i>

Let's start in the garage!

(CHUCKLES)

Okay, so, once we receive the next image

and compare it to the ones
we've already collected,

we'll know what it is that we found.

Ooh, perhaps
it's a heliosheath scintillation.

Yeah, it could be
a trans-Neptunian object.

(GASPS) Maybe it's a new planet.

Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.

Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity
and all its moons, I'll be happy.

Okay, the final image is coming in.

And the object we discovered is...

Come on,

Daddy needs a livable planet
he can rule with an iron fist.

A medium-sized asteroid.

That's it? How common.

That's the chicken fingers
on the menu of space.

I kind of like chicken fingers.

Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.

Come on, a medium-sized asteroid
is still an interesting discovery.

I suppose it could end up

on a collision course with Earth
and destroy life as we know it.

You dream different than me.

It is kind of cute.

Yeah, it is.
And you know we get to name it.

(EXCLAIMS) We better choose a name
no one can make fun of.

Sir Friedrich William Herschel
didn't do Uranus any favors.

- Hi.
- Hey, how'd it go?

Great. Dr. Gallo is terrific.

You know, I've always been insecure

that no one cares about what I have
to say, but she made me see--

Yeah, no one cares.
Did you help me out or not?

Okay, now, what I'm hearing

is that you feel that I sometimes
take too long to express myself,

and you wish I'd be more succinct.

You're only hearing that
because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.

All right, well, after we talked about
my issues with my mother,

nothing too deep,
just how she ruined my life,

I told her about you and your drug.
She said she'd be happy to meet you.

Really?
Oh! You're the best husband ever!

So, you'll go to the <i>Doctor Who</i> convention
with me next week?

I guess.

Oh, I actually did hear
your eyes roll that time. (CHUCKLES)

(WHIRRING)

Boy, when was the last time
Stuart cleaned this place?

No kidding.

Oh. Okay, I'm about to suck something up.

What do you think this object sounds like?

Howie, I don't want to play
Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.

So, what do you think
we should do with this room?

Well, I was thinking
a home theater or a gaming room,

you know, like a man cave.

Why can't it be a woman cave?

As long as it has a home
theater, a video game system

and you're not allowed in it,

you can call it whatever you want.

I'm being serious.

Well, what do you think we should do?

I don't know, maybe a home office or...

Oh... (EXHALES)

Look.

The teddy bear Stuart won
the night we took him to the fair.

(CHUCKLES)

He was so excited.

Yeah.

You know, no matter how hard they tried,

they could not guess his age.

I'll give it to him next time I see him.

- Have you heard from him since he left?
<i>- No.</i>

You'd think he would've called
once he got settled in.

- Maybe he's busy.
- Too busy to call?

He wasn't too busy to binge-watch
<i>Hot in Cleveland</i> with my Hulu password.

What is happening?

Are we missing him?

No, that's not what this feeling is.

Is it?

Of course not. He drove us crazy.

Like when you were gonna make that pie

and Stuart ate all the blueberries. God!

And he tried to deny it,
but his teeth were all purple.

- That was pretty cute.
- (CHUCKLES)

Yeah.

Ew, we are missing him!

So I was thinking,
maybe we can come up with a name

for the asteroid by combining our names.

That's a great idea.

I've got it.

We'll call it Cooper.

How is that both our names?

"Koo" from Koothrappali
and "per" from Cooper.

Yeah, so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?

Nah, you're right, that's dumb.

- Hey.
- Leonard, great news.

We discovered
a medium-sized asteroid together.

Wow! That's amazing!

I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.

Okay. Guess we're gonna
talk about you now.

Well, we are,
because Dr. Gallo made me realize

that I'm a worthwhile person
and that my feelings matter.

I learned that for free
from a cat poster, but good for you.

Okay, back to me.

I discovered an asteroid,
and now I get to name it.

Wait, what happened to us?

Now, this isn't about us,

this is about what's best
for the asteroid.

What are you thinking of naming it?

I haven't settled on anything yet.

We haven't settled on anything yet.

All right, way to go, Cat Poster.
You hang in there.

You know what'd be nice?
Name it after your girlfriends.

Show them how much you care.

- That is a great idea.
- It's perfect.

It appears romantic, but it's really just

a rock in space that gets me
out of Valentine's Day forever.

So, uh, what were you thinking?
Combine their names?

Mmm. I like it.

Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy

and the "Y" from Emily.

That's just Amy.

Exactly. See how well we work together?

And in double-blind studies,

Placinex proved
extremely effective in treating

all kinds of anxiety.

Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab

were worried about getting
FDA approval for Placinex.

They started taking it, stopped worrying.

So...

Got it.

Do you have any questions?

<i>- Just one.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

When you made your husband
pretend to be a patient

so you could get access to me,
what were you thinking there?

I just meant a question about the drug.

Yeah, I know what you meant.

Let's put that aside for a minute
and talk about why you married Leonard.

(SOFTLY) I don't wanna.

Here is a man
raised by an overbearing woman

who completely dominated
every aspect of his formative years.

Do you think

he's perpetuating that relationship
by seeking out a partner like you?

You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.

That was a big selling point.

<i>Hi, Sheldon. What's up?</i>

Good news. You're an asteroid.

<i>Uh. Please tell me what to say next.</i>

Perhaps I should explain.

While working with Koothrappali,

we discovered an asteroid,
and I named it after you.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

<i>Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic.</i>

<i>But what about Rajesh?</i>

<i>He was okay with you choosing the name?</i>

Well, it took a little negotiating,
but I wore him down.

<i>We get the asteroid,</i>

and if you and I have children,

they all have to be named Rajesh.

<i>All of them?</i>

Even the girls.

<i>Okay, I think I know what to say now.</i>

How can I not sound like his mother

when our entire bedroom
is filled with <i>Star Wars</i> toys?

I mean, have you ever had sex
with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?

I went to college in the '70s.
It was a hairier time.

I'm gonna say yes.

You know, if anything,
he's turning me into his mother.

Before I did pharmaceutical sales,
I was an actress.

You know, I was pretty good.

You know, girl-next-door type, but hot.

Doable.

Hmm.

And not only am I Leonard's mother,

but we have this man-child
living with us named Sheldon.

Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.

I wasn't sure if he was real.

Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get

when I use too much toilet paper.

Wow. You really do have
a lot on your plate.

(SIGHS) I do.

You know, Leonard's right.

Talking to you is really helping.

Oh, I'm glad.

You know, you might also benefit
from a prescription for anxiety.

Okay, if you think it'll help.

Oh! Just don't make it Placinex.

I do not need
sudden fits of homicidal rage.

<i>I miss you.</i>

I miss you as well.

I can't believe I miss Stuart.

I guess I just miss when life was simpler.

ALL: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

Remember, girls,
you decide what makes you happy,

not your emotionally withholding mothers.

Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

(INHALES DEEPLY)

(SOFTLY) I really miss this.

English SDH

Hey, so I saw a movie trailer
the other day.

How could Batman possibly fight Superman?

I mean, isn't that dumb?

Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

Well, Batman's got a lot of money,

maybe he builds a suit
that can do everything Superman can do.

No, no, no. I've seen that movie,
it's called <i>Iron Man.</i>

BERNADETTE: <i>What do you do
when Batman wins?</i>

EMILY: <i>Well, it depends on...</i>

What is happening?

I don't know.

But it's beautiful.

Yeah, and now Ben Affleck is Batman?

Oh, he was great in <i>Shakespeare in Love.</i>

Ooh, we should
watch that next girls' night.

We could do a double-feature with
the Leonardo DiCaprio <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

Oh, I love me some Leo.

And it's gone.

Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy
to report I'm feeling much better.

- Good for you.
- Yeah, yeah.

My fever is gone,
my sinuses are pressure-free,

and my mucus is as clear
as a Yosemite waterfall.

Glad to hear it.

I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.

Yay.

Well, why isn't everyone happy?

Your little ray of sunshine
is ready to beam again.

You really don't know why?

No. But I knew that
his "yay" was sarcastic.

It was not bad for a guy whose last bowel
movement sounded like rain on a roof.

Let me refresh your memory.

Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.

Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.
I made your bed.

I checked your mouth for thrush.

You can rub your own chest.

Sure, grope every other man on the planet
but draw the line with me.

I brought you
a little care package from work.

It's our latest anti-viral and
the best decongestant we make.

I hope laughter is the best medicine,
'cause this care package is a joke.

- Hey, she came all the way here--
- (SNEEZES)

You're gonna wanna take these with food.

Sheldon, stop being a baby
and let Emily take a look at you.

SHELDON: <i>She's a dermatologist.</i>

I went to medical school.

<i>Well, in that case, try removing</i>

<i>the irritating patch of brown skin
standing next to you.</i>

Okay, here you go.

Leonard, I'm dying.

You're not dying, it's just the flu.

I asked for chicken noodle, this
is chicken and stars. It's killing me.

I never did get that
chicken noodle, did I?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(LINE RINGING)

<i>- Hi, Sheldon.</i>
- Hello.

<i>Are you feeling any better?</i>

Physically yes, but I'm upset because
everyone's mad at me for no good reason.

<i>Why don't you tell me what happened,
and in a gentle, loving way,</i>

<i>I'll explain to you why you're wrong.</i>

Well, you know how when you're sick,

you're allowed to be cranky
and say whatever you want

and other people's feelings don't matter?

(SIGHS) <i>Gentle and loving,
this is gonna be tricky.</i>

I had a 101 fever.

If that's not a time to
verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?

<i>Sheldon, when you're sick
you can be unbearable.</i>

<i>And that's why your friends
have been known to work late,</i>

<i>or sneak out to the movies,</i>

<i>or stay at a neurobiology conference
three days after it's ended.</i>

You stayed in Michigan all week
to avoid being around me?

<i>No, no, not just that. I mean...</i>

<i>Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.</i>

You know, I'm not the only one
who's unpleasant when they're sick.

When Penny got food poisoning,

she threw up so loudly
I could barely hear the television.

<i>Oh, I just heard something.
Might be hail, might be gunfire.</i>

<i>Either way, I'm gonna
go take pictures. Bye!</i>

(LAPTOP CHIMES)

- Hey, Stuart.
- Hey.

Where's Sheldon? Still sick?

No, he's fine.
We just needed a little break.

Yeah, I get that. When I brought him
his comics the other day,

he said, "Oh, great,
death is literally at my door."

He was being a jerk to everyone,
don't take it personally.

Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants,
I couldn't if I wanted to.

Ah, I wish we could do more stuff
without Sheldon.

I wish that all the time.

Usually before I
blow out birthday candles.

You know, Amy took some time off from him.

And it really improved their relationship.

Oh, okay. As long as it doesn't end
with us having coitus with him, I'm in.

We should all take a trip or something.

You know, Penny and I have been talking
about taking a weekend in Vegas.

- Maybe we should all go.
- (SIGHS)

Bernie would love that.

Oh, oh, maybe we could get one of those
party buses to take us there.

That sounds really fun.

Yeah, that sounds fun!
A party bus party don't stop! (CHUCKLES)

Oh, when I say "party" you say "bus!"

- No. No!
- No. No!

So, the guys and I were talking about

renting a party bus and
everyone going to Vegas.

Ooh, that could be fun.

But just to be clear, you mean a party bus
with booze and music, right?

Not like juice boxes and video games.

Yes. And Howard's birthday
was a drop-off party,

you didn't have to stay.

- Oh, I'm in. When are we going?
- This weekend.

Oh, where are we going?

Well, Vegas, but--

Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy?
No, thank you.

Well, that's fine, 'cause actually,
you're not invited.

(STAMMERS) Well, that's hurtful.

Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.

Yeah, I can consider a place
America's urinal cake

and still enjoy the occasional visit.

Not this time.

Well, fine.
Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.

He's coming, too.

- Well, then Raj and I--
- Nope.

Very well, Stuart.

Oh, great! Do that.

Ugh! Stuart.

<i>Hi, Sheldon. What's new?</i>

Our friends are jerks and
I'm mad at all of them.

<i>Okay, I said, "What's new," but sure.</i>

Can you believe they planned a trip
to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?

<i>Did you refuse to apologize and act like
they were stupid for being mad?</i>

You know, I liked it better
when there was still

a little mystery left in our relationship.

<i>Everyone tried to take care of you and
you were nothing but mean to them.</i>

I can't believe you're not on my side.

You know, I was on your side
when someone stole your car radio.

<i>Who else's side could you have been on?</i>

I don't know! A music-loving hobo
with a heart of gold?

<i>Sheldon, I understand that you're upset
because you feel left out,</i>

<i>but I don't know why we're even talking
about this. Just apologize to them.</i>

Fine, if that's what it takes
to go on their dumb trip.

<i>Maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad.</i>

<i>It's called empathy.
It's something you could work on.</i>

I have empathy. Now watch.

Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.

<i>Great.</i>

<i>Now try it as if
this isn't your first day as a person.</i>

Fine. Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.

Hey, I felt a little something.
Wait, wait, let me try again.

Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.

I was mean to him.

He must've felt terrible.
Oh, now I feel terrible.

Neat!

<i>Glad I could help.</i>

Now let me see you feel bad for lying

and staying in Detroit
longer than you needed to.

<i>I feel so, so bad.</i>

Hey, we're both great at this!

Leonard, get ready for an apology.

And with the added twist of an M. Night
Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.

Ah, so like every other
M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen,

you spoil it in advance.

Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis
was dead the whole time, that's not on me.

Okay. Here it comes. You tried
to take care of me when I was sick

and I was mean to you.

There's no excuse for that,
and I'm truly sorry.

Thank you, I appreciate that.

And I want you to know that
that is sincere. I do feel bad.

I'm not just saying it
to be included on your trip.

I appreciate that, too.

Terrific. Now, all that's left
is for you to invite me to come,

me to ask, "Are you sure?"
You to say, "Absolutely."

And then me to bring it home with,
"How could I say no to that face."

You're still not coming.

But I apologized and I meant it.

I know that we don't play this game
very often, but you're doing it wrong.

Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you
upset a lot of people while you were sick.

I'm not in a position
to just say you can come.

Well, all right.

What if I apologize to all of them?

Fine. If you apologize to everyone

and they all say it's okay,
then yes, you can come.

Challenge accepted! Sounds like it's time
for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour!

Well, I hope it's as much fun as

the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks
Local Menus Tour.

(LAUGHING) Oh, my goodness.
Do you remember "Comes with apsparagus"?

Howard and Bernadette,
you tried to comfort me when I was ill

and I treated you terribly. I'm sorry.

Wow. (CHUCKLES) I'm impressed.

No, no, no. Wait, I'm not done.
Allow me to underscore my sentiment

with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's
<i>I'm Sorry</i> played on the pan flute.

(PLAYING PAN FLUTE)

- Apology accepted!
- Forgiven! We forgive you.

All right. That's eight hours
of practice down the drain.

And to memorialize this occasion,
here are your commemorative T-shirts.

(HOWARD READING)

(BERNADETTE READING)

(SHUTTER CLICKS)

All you did was offer
maternal care and affection,

and all you received in return
was rude and insensitive behavior.

Can this wait?

I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow
and I have more apologies to make.

Okay, fine, I accept your apology,
now get out!

Wonderful. Now would you mind
holding up this shirt while I--

Leonard!

You brought me my comic books
when I wasn't feeling well.

That, that was thoughtful and
I was insensitive. I'm sorry.

Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.

And, now, I want you to know
that I mean it.

This isn't me just wanting to
go on the trip to Las Vegas.

What trip to Las Vegas?

The one everyone's taking this weekend
on the party bus.

Of course I wasn't invited.

That would be my understanding.

On a less painful subject,
what size T-shirt do you take?

Raj, you were being a good friend

and my illness was no excuse
for my behavior.

I hope that you can accept my apology.

Of course I do.

And Emily, I'm sorry for saying
dermatologists aren't real doctors.

And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?

Well, I would imagine
when your job is popping zits

and squirting Botox into old lady faces--

Okay. Okay, the point is
that we accept your apology.

Look, maybe you do.
He just insulted me again.

Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.

Why are you defending him?

Well, I believe I can answer that.

Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy.

Now, why don't you accept my apology,
you receive your free T-shirt...

I hope extra small is okay,
for some reason Wolowitz took a medium.

(SCOFFS)

Well, I don't accept your apology.

What are you doing?

It's called standing up for myself.
You should try it sometime.

Fine, how about this?
You're making me uncomfortable

by prolonging this ridiculous fight
and I wish you'd stop.

You want me to stop? No problem.

No, come on. No, please don't leave.

Point of clarification, are you still
going on the trip? Because if not--

Don't worry, you're good.

I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

(STAMMERS) Wait, I can do that better.

I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

Yeah, wow, I don't know
which one I like more.

So, was the fight really bad?

Well, no. As a fight, it was excellent.

You know, she used harsh language
and slammed the door.

Although, as I say this, that might not
have been what you were asking.

You think they'll still go on the trip?

All I know is after the fight
I went to Emily's to smooth--

- They're not going on the trip.
- No.

What is wrong with you?

Look at him.
Caring about what's wrong with me.

That is some top shelf empathy.

Hey, well, we should start a club.

You went to Emily's to apologize
and when you left she was crying.

That is true. I suppose
I should apologize again.

- ALL: No!
- Stop.

Is she okay?

Yeah. I calmed her down but
she's not going to Vegas if he's going.

Wait, that's an option?
I didn't know that was an option.

Well, that is fine, because I've decided
that I won't be joining you.

I've realized that the most genuine way
to demonstrate the remorse I feel is

to let you have this weekend
to yourselves.

That's very mature of you.

Well, I've been on
a little trip myself recently.

Not to "Sin City" but to "sincere city."

Where, instead of genital warts,

the only growth you'll come back with
is personal growth.

And there's your next T-shirt.

Ooh, check out the stripper pole.

You know what that means.

That Raj will be on it
before we make it to the freeway?

You know it! (EXCLAIMING)

(HYDRAULICS HISS)

BERNADETTE: This is so cool!

PENNY: Here's some champagne.

LEONARD: Mmm-hmm.

Well, I would like to propose a toast.
To a well-deserved weekend--

- A-ha!
- (ALL SCREAM)

What are you doing?

My plan was to jump out at the state line,

but one of my nose plugs
fell into the toilet.

You couldn't give us just one weekend?

I told him this was a bad idea.

What do we do, kick them off?

If we drop them off at a fire station,

they have to take them.
No questions asked.

Before you do,

please give me one more chance
to apologize to Emily.

Oh, God.

Emily, as I'm sure you know,

I'm considered an odd fellow.

But what you don't know is that
while I often say the wrong thing,

in my heart, I mean well.

I think that you are
a smart and wonderful woman.

And we all think that you can
do better than Koothrappali.

You know, Sheldon--

Shh, let him finish.

So, for all the times I've offended you,

and all the times that I'll offend you
in the future, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Good. Then I'll be leaving now.

Oh, it's okay, Sheldon, come with us.

Oh, that's very kind of you,

but I'm sure you'll all have a better time
without me. Let's go, Stuart.

- But I wanna stay.
- Stuart, now!

You know, I know he's a jerk,
but I actually feel bad for him.

And now you see the problem.

(HYDRAULICS HISS)

Come on, you pain in the ass!

That's me! Bye, Stuart.

Wait!

I'm a pain in the ass, too!

- (POP SONG PLAYING)
- Are you relieved that you and Raj

were able to patch things up?

At the moment?

No, not really.

Shake it, baby.

Whoo! Work that thing!

English - SDH

Here's a fun postal fact.

You know, the inside of our mailbox
is under federal jurisdiction,

so if you broke my right thumb,

that's the Pasadena City Police, but if
you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.

If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him,
not breaking his thumb.

Yeah.

Ooh, I got a letter from my Meemaw.
(SNIFFS) Mmm. Smell this.

(SNIFFS) What is that?

Roses, BENGAY and
Dr. Scholl's Foot Powder.

Ah, yup. Grandma by Calvin Klein.

You know, the last time
I got a handwritten letter

was from someone who told me
I park like a blind person.

LEONARD: That someone has a name.

SHELDON: Uh, thank you.

Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.

Oh, but then she found her old ones.

Oh, so now the new ones
are just gonna be her church teeth.

Fun, like your Comic-Con Spock ears
and your around-the-house Spock ears.

PENNY: I park fine.

Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!

Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.

Oh, you are going to love her.

She is the kindest, sweetest woman
you'll ever meet.

Unless you're a gopher
digging up her vegetable garden.

In that case you can expect to have
your head bashed in with a shovel.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

That's not her, that's not her,
that's not her,

that's not her, that's not her, that's
not her, that's not her, that's not her.

Really? The old Asian man
is not your Meemaw?

And that's not helpful.

I got her an iPhone for Christmas,
I'll see where she is.

Oh, that's nice, most people her age
don't embrace technology.

Oh, she doesn't even know she has it.

No, I had my sister slip it in her bag
so that I can track her like a sea turtle.

Same as when we lost you at the zoo.

For the hundredth time, I smelled
kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.

That still doesn't explain
how you ended up on a freeway divider.

Moon Pie!

(GASPS) Meemaw! I'm so happy to see you!

I'm so happy to see you, too! (CHUCKLES)

Oh, you got even smaller, I love it!

Meemaw, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

Hi, so nice to finally meet you.
Let me take this for you, Meemaw.

Thank you.

Oh, no. Now, you call her Constance.
I call her Meemaw.

You have your own Meemaw. It's not
my fault she died when you were four.

Is that nice to say to your friend?

It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.

- Can you please live with us forever?
- (LAUGHING)

That's ridiculous,
if you had a super power

and spent your whole life
being told to suppress it,

when you finally decide to embrace
that power, why hide in isolation?

I'm sorry, and how much money
did your version of <i>Frozen</i> make?

I'm just saying, instead of <i>Let It Go,</i>

she should really sing <i>Look At Me
Hiding in a Freezer Like a DOVEBAR.</i>

She built an ice castle,
made a snow monster

and gave herself
a complete makeover in one day.

You know what I saw you do today?

Eat a block of cream cheese
straight from the foil

and lie about it to your wife.

Sorry for eavesdropping,

but did you know they actually had
the song <i>Let It Go</i> in place

before they finalized the story?

Yeah, that's true.
In fact, they liked the song so much

they retooled the whole script around it.

Which is probably why that movie sucks.

(CHUCKLES) Here we are talking
about <i>Frozen</i> and yet you got burned.

I'm so sorry,
but how can you not like that movie?

I just think it gets more credit
than it deserves.

- Ah, that's what I said an hour ago.
- Wow.

You've been talking
about <i>Frozen</i> for an hour?

You should've seen us after
<i>The Good Dinosaur.</i>

It was a classic western
set in the post-Jurassic period,

and it changed my life.

Are you comfortable?

Very. It's nice to rest
after 800 flights of stairs.

- You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

(GASPS) There's Amy.
I just know you're gonna hit it off.

You both have the same fashion sense.

Hello! Come in and say hi to my Meemaw.

- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

How was your trip?

Wonderful, and the pilot did
such a good job I gave him a butterscotch.

That's great. And look at you,
sitting in Sheldon's spot.

- You know, I don't even get to sit there.
- Yeah.

And you never will.

(EXCLAIMS)

Ask her to do the tissue thing,
do it, ask her.

- Can I have a tissue?
- Of course.

Isn't that the best?
She's like Grandma Spider-Man.

(CHUCKLES)

He's been saying that since he was little.
I still don't know what it means.

Well, you two sit down and get to
know each other. I'll get your room ready.

Oh, now don't you go looking through
my suitcase for presents.

- If I did would I find any?
- Maybe.

But you might also find
my brassieres and bloomers.

That's a risk I'm willing to take!

Well, this is so nice.
He is so excited to have you--

Okay, now let's you and me
get something straight.

He may think
that I came to bake him cookies,

but the real reason is to size you up.

(STAMMERS)

Size me up?

Sheldon's mother may be okay with you,
but I'm not so easy.

Well, I'm, I'm sure you'll like me
once you get to know me. (CHUCKLES)

Well, you better hope so.

A Texas Special cattle and calf car
train set with authentic horn and bell!

- Thank you, Meemaw!
- Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.

Amy, why don't you look excited?
You get to watch me play with this!

Huh, I see you're reading <i>Saga.</i>

Yeah, I hear it's pretty good.

It is. And not a lot of comics
have a woman with wings

breast-feeding a baby right on the cover.

I'll take your word for it.

You should, he's really looked.

I'm Raj, by the way. This is Howard.

- Hi.
- Claire.

I've never seen you here before, Claire.

It's my first time. I'm looking for
inspiration for this movie I'm writing.

You're a screenwriter?

Well, screenwriter/bartender/
a month away from living in my car.

(RAJ CHUCKLES)

Yeah, I get that.

I'm a scientist/party planner/
small dog enthusiast/

guy who probably
should've stopped at scientist.

You're really a scientist?

Well, astrophysicist.

That's perfect. Do you think I could
pick your brain for my movie sometime?

It's animated sci-fi for kids.

Sure, I love animated movies.

He does. And he has the <i>Lilo and Stitch</i>
collector plates to prove it.

Excuse me for wanting
a little magic in my life.

Here's my number.
Give me a call, we'll get together.

- Great.
- See ya.

Yeah, bye.

What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.

- So?
- So? How do you think she'd feel about you

helping a beautiful girl
with her screenplay?

I wouldn't say she's beautiful.

Really? You don't think she's attractive?

I do, I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.

Constance, are you sure
I can't pour you some wine?

Oh, no wine for me.

Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.

There you go, Meemaw.
I made it just how you like it,

a lot, in a glass.

Thank you, Moon Pie.

I'm curious, why do you
call Sheldon "Moon Pie"?

Because he's so nummy-nummy--

- She could just eat him up.
- She could just eat him up.

And I call her Meemaw because,

- well, just look at her.
- (LAUGHS)

It's interesting that Leonard and Penny
know about his nickname

and you don't.

Oh, well, now that I'm hearing it,
it does sound familiar.

How could it? I never told you
and you never bothered to ask.

Well, now I know.

So, Penny, I understand
you have a new job.

Yes, I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

Oh, it's so wonderful that you modern gals
can have it all.

A husband and a full-time career.

I have a relationship
and a full-time career, too.

That doesn't bode well.

Why not?
You just said it's okay for her to work.

Well, Leonard doesn't need
as much tending to as Sheldon does.

And as Moon Pie explained, (CHUCKLES)
Leonard's work is more of a hobby.

- That's my best friend.
- Yeah.

Look, I get that you're protective
of your grandson,

but he's an adult now, and maybe

I understand what he needs
better than you do.

I appreciate your honesty, dear.

- Thank you.
- And here's some more honesty.

I don't like you very much.

Well, maybe I don't like you either.

No, no, no. You have to like each other.

Well, we have a 4:30 reservation
at Applebee's.

I think I should leave.

Why? Other than you two fighting,
we're having such a good time.

The minute you left the room

your precious Meemaw
started giving me a really hard time.

You know, I don't need this.

Let her go. And under no circumstance
will you give her that engagement ring.

What ring?

Maybe we should give them some privacy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

You have an engagement ring?

Yes.

Penny, did you know about this?

All right, let's go.

When did you get an engagement ring?

Well, my mother gave it to me

and I had been thinking about
giving it to you, but then we broke up.

Well, thank goodness for that.

Sheldon, will you please tell
your grandmother to stay out of this?

Oh, I don't think I could do that.

Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring
will never be on her finger.

Yeah, I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.

You know, who said
I even want to be engaged to him?

And if I do,
I don't need your hand-me-downs!

All right, look. Let's remain calm
and analyze this situation.

You know, I realize that you've only
known each other for less than a day,

but is it possible this crankiness is
because your cycles have synced?

You leave the room
and let the grown-ups talk. Now!

Don't speak to him like he's a child!

Thank you. Now I'm gonna go next door
and play with Leonard.

Okay, so you met this girl,
you exchanged numbers

and you're gonna meet up with her.

Just to help her with her screenplay.

Well, I guess that's not so bad.

You weren't there, he was really flirting.

Hey, it's not my fault if American women
project their fantasies

on foreigners with the kind of
magical voice that grants wishes.

I'm sure it was harmless.
People flirt, no big deal.

- Really? So it's okay if I flirt--
- Not you, I own your ass.

The real question is,
where are you with Emily?

Uh, it's hard to say, I think we're good.

But things like this make me wonder
if Emily's really the right person for me.

I mean, did you guys ever
have doubts about each other?

- No, never.
- Absolutely.

What?

Howie, you forget how much
of our early dates involved

you doing magic and me doing this.

Fine. I had reservations about you, too.

- No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

Well, it doesn't matter now,
'cause I love how things worked out.

Me, too. I think you're
even more beautiful than this rose.

Wow. You know,
the last time I saw my grandma,

the most exciting thing was watching
the ash of her cigarette get longer

and wondering if it was gonna
fall in her pudding.

Did it?

Yeah, right in there,
she ate it and everything.

- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- SHELDON: <i>Leonard and Penny?</i>

<i>Leonard and Penny?
Leonard and Penny?</i>

Come in!

Hey, what happened? Is Amy gone?

No, they asked me to leave
so they could speak privately.

- Uh-oh.
- Yeah, I know, it was quite tense.

So here's the million-dollar question.

Who wants to pop over there
and get my trains?

All right, I've made up my mind.

I'm gonna do the right thing,
call this girl,

and let her know
that I'm in a relationship.

Okay, so far we've heard,
"Made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily."

"Made up my mind to date both of them
by pretending to be twin brothers."

And, "Made up my mind,
I'll ask for a threesome,

"and if they say no,
I'll play it off as a joke."

I'm calling her. And the threesome
didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.

You're right. It could totally happen.
(LAUGHING)

- CLAIRE: <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

Hi, yeah, it's Raj.
Rajesh, we met at the comic book store.

Hey, what's up?
Figure out what time you're free?

Actually, that's why I'm calling. I, um...

I just, I need to let you know
that I have a girlfriend.

Okay, good for you.

Well, no, no, I didn't want to mislead you
after you asked me out.

I didn't ask you out,
I just need help with my screenplay.

Wait, are you saying
that we didn't have a vibe?

Why do you care if we have a vibe?
You have a girlfriend.

Come on, I just told you
I have a girlfriend,

the least you can do is tell me
if we had a vibe.

- Sure, we had a vibe.
- I knew it! Okay, we did have a vibe.

This is exciting, what's my next move?

You still have a girlfriend.

Right. Good catch.

Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time,
and good luck with your screenplay.

Hang on. We're both adults,

we can still get together
without it meaning anything.

Not me. Ever since you admitted we had
a vibe I've been planning our wedding.

Look. It's just coffee.

I'll ask you some questions about science
and if you propose, I promise to say "no."

Okay. Well that hurts a little, but okay.
(CHUCKLES)

- Great, I'll text you.
- Bye!

All right. So, we're meeting for coffee,
like two adults.

Everybody's happy, easy-peasy.

Are you gonna tell Emily?

Yeah, of course, we have no secrets.

When are you gonna tell Emily?

He lied about the cream cheese,
he ate the whole thing, I saw him!

Look, I know you think I'm not right for
Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot.

You have no idea how much I put up with.

I know more than you think I do.

Really? You know what it's like
to have date night ruined

because Google changed their font?

Young lady. If you think
I don't know what it's like

to live with a stubborn, egotistical man,
then you're wrong.

'Cause that was my husband.

Really?

(SIGHS) There were days I wanted
to fill his pockets with corn

and toss him in the pig pen.

Well, if you understand, then why are you
giving me such a hard time?

Because when you broke up with Sheldon
it hurt him deeply,

and I don't wanna see that happen again.

(DOOR OPENS)

Hi, sorry. Sheldon would like to say
something to you.

- SHELDON: <i>No, I wouldn't.</i>
- Just get in here.

- Hello.
- Go ahead.

Meemaw, I'm sorry, but...

I have to defend my girlfriend to you.

Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.

I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.

I know what a challenging man he could be,

but I saw you stand by him and
make him into a better person.

I did.

Well, that is exactly what I've been doing
the last five years

with this little work in progress.

He never disappoints, does he?

I think what Sheldon means to say,

is we've both grown together.
Isn't that right?

- Well--
- Say yes!

Yes.

Fine. If you feel so strongly,
I won't stand in your way.

Thank you.

So if he wanted to give me
that engagement ring,

we would have your blessing?

I suppose.

I just gave you my virginity,
woman, cool your jets!

Yeah, see, if you just change the story
to the destruction of a galaxy,

then a super massive
black hole could work.

(SCOFFS) This is great. Thank you so much.

I just gotta figure out a way

<i>for everyone to die that
isn't too scary for children.</i>

And that's how Mommy and Daddy met!

Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?

I will!

English - SDH

Gentlemen.

LEONARD: Hey.
HOWARD: Hello.

If any of you are looking for something
to do on Valentine's Day,

Amy and I'll be streaming our first ever
live episode of <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

You're welcome to join us
as we celebrate the timeless love affair

between wind and flapping fabric.

Penny and I have dinner reservations
that night, but any other time, no.

Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in
the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.

Not a clue. Raj?

I'm spending Valentine's Day with Emily.

You don't sound very excited about it.

I am. I am. I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and I are right for each other.

Does this have to do with that girl
you had coffee with?

You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?

You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever,

why don't you just do it already?

Just get it over with.

Well, you say it like it's easy.

Have any one of you
ever broken up with anyone?

- No.
- Not really.

You know, once I ordered
an Uber by accident.

I just got in and went somewhere.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

So, you're really gonna break up with her?

Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?

Well, I have broken up with
my fair share of guys.

I mean, how many times
did I break up with Leonard?

I stopped counting at four.

Great. My advice to you is do it at her
place so you can leave when you need to.

Tell the truth, make it quick,
and be prepared for tears.

Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go
in there, really dry myself out.

- She meant Emily.
- No, I really didn't.

- You're seriously breaking up with me?
- Yeah.

And you thought right before
Valentine's Day was a good time to do it?

You're right, let's talk again
in a few days.

Hey, Claire. Hi, it's Rajesh.

I was wondering if
you're free for Valentine's Day?

Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.

But I just broke up with my girlfriend.

Right before Valentine's Day?
(SCOFFS) What an ass.

Please take me back!
Our love was meant to be--

(SOBBING) I'm gonna be all alone
on Valentine's Day!

Hmm, you were right, tears.

Okay. And we are live in 22 minutes.

I'm nervous. I hope people will be around
to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.

People who are fans of an Internet show
about flags? Trust me, they're around.

Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day,
I haven't forgotten about you tonight.

What do you mean?

Well, you've become such an integral part
of my life as well as this show,

I felt it only right to include
your name in the title.

(CHUCKLES)

That is so sweet.

So, from now on, this program
will officially be known as

<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper and
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present...</i>

Catchy.

I'm gonna check the temp on the tub.

Don't make it too hot.

Sorry, but too hot is
the only temperature I come in.

Look at that. You shaved it all.

You're welcome.

Um, question. This is my first hot tub,

is it supposed to come with
a rat flopping around in it?

Ew, really? Get it out!

How?

I wish we had a skimmer.

Well, you turn off the jets,
I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.

I don't know how to turn off the jets!

Good, I don't know where
you keep the strainer!

Excuse me.

Bad news, the maitre d' said
it's gonna be at least an hour.

An hour? What?
That's crazy, we have a reservation.

- I know.
- So, what did you say?

Thanks, sorry to bother you.

But I said it like a badass.

All right, well, can't you like
slip him some money or somethin'?

Really? I've never done that before.
Does it work?

Do people like money?
Is that what you're asking?

A lot of attitude from the woman
who thought MC-squared was a rapper.

Now is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

that's basically national sex night?

I'm sorry. You're pretty. I'm stupid.

Hello. Just checking again for Hofstadter.
Still gonna be an hour?

- I'm afraid so.
- Okay, thanks.

Hey,

I think you may have dropped this?

Oh.

Anybody lose a 20?

I did.

Oh, I took care of it.

Okay, we are live in five, four, three--

Oh, wait, oh, shoot, I already pushed
the button, never mind, we're live.

Hello, and welcome to a special
live edition of <i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper...</i>

<i>And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present...</i>

<i>- Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags!
- Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags!</i>

Consider tonight's episode a
Valentine's Day gift for you, our viewers.

It's also my gift to you.

That was clear, right?
'Cause you're not getting anything else.

Since we're live, you'll finally
be able to reach out to us

with your flag thoughts
and flag questions.

Allow us to answer a few quick ones
that we get all the time.

Yes, I really am a doctor.
Yes, she really is my girlfriend.

And no, I just blink a lot,
it's not Morse code for "rescue me."

(COMPUTER CALL RINGING)

Oh, uh, uh...

Here's our first call.

Hello and welcome to <i>Fun with Flags,</i>
what's your question?

RAJ: <i>What is wrong with me,
why am I so self-destructive?</i>

- Rajesh?
<i>- Yes!</i>

Whenever things are going well,
I always find a way to ruin it.

You two look happy. How do you do it?

I think it starts with
good communication--

You know what?
That's not a flag question, next caller.

I hope you don't think I'm just saying
this because it's Valentine's Day,

but I love you so much.

I'm gonna put this down your robe.

It's not moving
but I think it's still alive.

Well, should we put it back
in there a few minutes?

No!

And it's not a rat, it's a rabbit.

- We need to save it.
- Well, how do we do that?

I don't know, look it up on your phone.
I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

"Taking care of injured rabbit." Okay.

"Make sure it's comfortable and warm."

He was just in a hot tub,
I'm gonna say check.

Anything else?

"To make sure it's not dehydrated,
feed him an electrolyte solution.

"If it's not responding, use a warm cloth
to wash its face and genitals."

Yeah.

This is ridiculous. You know what,
I'm gonna talk to the maitre d'.

- What're you gonna say?
- I don't know. I'm gonna flirt with him.

I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

I'm still sleeping with you tonight.

See if you can get a table by the window.

- Hi, there. What's your name?
- Glenn.

Oh, boy, it is crazy
in here tonight, huh, Glenn?

Well, you know, Valentine's Day.

Yes, ugh, I bet your girlfriend is
super bummed you had to work tonight.

Anyway, look, we have been
waiting awhile, and I just feel--

With all due respect, ma'am,
there's nothing I can do.

(CHUCKLES) You don't have to
call me ma'am.

- Okay.
- I mean, we're basically the same age.

(LAUGHS) Okay.

How old are you?

I'm 21, how old are you?

Just shut up, Glenn.

Come on. Let's get out of here.

- What, why?
- Because I'm young, let's go!

Rajesh, it's perfectly normal to have
doubts after breaking up with someone.

RAJ: <i>You really think so?</i>

You know what's not normal?

Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.

Unless that emotion is excitement over
New Zealand changing their flag.

And good luck you crazy Kiwis,
we're rooting for you.

Your friend is hurting.

No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say
I always talk about my feelings too much.

Why, I suppose that could be
a legitimate concern in a relationship.

Perhaps even a red flag,
and speaking of red flags,

check out this sexy number
from the former Soviet Union.

Hubba, hubba.

- (COMPUTER CALL RINGING)
- Oh, uh...

We have another caller.
Hi, you're on <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

BARRY: <i>Hello, I wanna talk about
how lonely I am, too.</i>

Kripke, is that you?

Yeah, I'm just sittin' here

all by myself wondering if I'll ever
find someone to share my life with.

Preferably Asian, 18 to 24, no fatties.

Please, all comments and questions
should be flag related.

BARRY: <i>All right.
Is my pole flag related?</i>

I don't see why not.

He's eating, that's a good sign.

You're gonna have to wait one hour
until you can go swimming again.

- He's pretty cute.
- He is.

Should we name him?

It is Valentine's Day.
How about Valentino?

Nice. A classic rabbit name.

Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit,
Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

Look at all that chest hair and overbite,
of course you're a Wolowitz.

Son of a bitch, he bit me!

- Are you okay?
- No. I'm not okay.

Wild rabbits can have rabies.

Oh. Well, why'd you put your finger
near its mouth?

Poor judgment, obviously!

He's so little, I'm sure it's fine.

How can it be fine? I just got attacked
by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.

It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?

(MUFFLED) It is freakin' amazing.

Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.

I was just hungry and cranky.

And I've never been called ma'am before.

- Is that a big deal?
- Kind of.

When's the first time
someone's called you sir?

Sixth grade. But I wore a sport coat
and carried a brief case so...

Can you believe when I met you I was 22?

I mean, it's crazy.
Where did all that time go?

Hmm, you watched <i>The Bachelor</i> a lot.

Yeah, go ahead and make jokes.
But your 30s are almost over.

No, they're not.

You're closer to 40 than you are to 30.

(LAUGHS) You married an old man.

Tell you what,
let's do something fun tonight.

It won't make us any younger.

Well, maybe not,
but someday we actually will be old

and we'll look back on this night and
remember what a good time we had.

Okay, like what?

I know, food fight!

I'll keep thinking.

Look, I know you both
feel bad about being alone,

but sometimes the best thing you can do
is take a little time for yourself,

especially when you
just got out of a relationship.

And speaking of ending relationships,
when British Honduras became Belize,

they designed a new flag
with a tree on it.

And I would like
to hang myself from that tree.

But Amy, when you and Sheldon split up

didn't you start dating
someone right away?

Well, I wouldn't say right away.

And actually, it was three different men.

BARRY: <i>Three different men?
Damn, girl, way to give the milk away!</i>

Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.

BARRY: <i>No, actually, I'm still here.</i>

- Now?
<i>- Yep.</i>

- Now?
<i>- Yep.</i>

Now?

Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.

Before Emily, I was alone for so long.

I don't know if I can do that again.

Well, you know, here is something
that might cheer you up.

The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but

three legs sharing
a weird pair of underpants.

So, you think you got problems...

I have an idea.

Maybe someone in our audience
would be interested in meeting Rajesh.

Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent--

RAJ: <i>Rich parents,
don't forget rich parents!</i>

- Spoiled astrophysicist, who not only--
- (COMPUTER CALL RINGING)

Oh, well, that was quick.

Hi, you're on <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

BARRY: <i>Hey, I think I got cut off.</i>

Hello, Kripke.

BARRY: <i>I have a flag question.</i>

<i>How many men did you have sex with?</i>

Let's see, what's young and fun?
Uh, we could go dancing.

Are you actually gonna dance?

- Well, of course.
- Yeah, no one wants to see that.

Hey, how about skinny-dipping
at the beach?

No, I don't need any fish
nibbling my business.

Oh, there's a screening of <i>Moulin Rouge.</i>
I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.

That sounds fun. When's it start?

Midnight.

Midnight, really?

You know what? Let's do it.

Okay, great!

Oh, wait, uh, it's sold out.

- Oh, thank God!
- Yes!

It says rabies in rabbits
is highly unlikely.

Terrific!

It's not terrific.
Lots of highly unlikely things happen.

You saw what's under this robe
and you still married me.

If you're really worried, we'll take him
to a vet and have him tested.

Good, thank you. Okay, there is a test.

All they have to do is cut off his head
and check his brain.

Oh, cut off his head?
That's where his little nose is.

He's not showing any symptoms.

Okay, I guess, I'll just go to
the emergency room to be safe.

Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

that was my hypochondria.

We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

RAJ: <i>I mean, this is the first time
I've ever broken up with someone.</i>

<i>I just... I didn't realize it was
gonna hurt just this much.</i>

It really can.

All right.

Nothing about this is fun.

And no one wants to talk about flags.

But I haven't spoken in over 10 minutes.

So, enjoy your new show, Internet.

RAJ: <i>I'm sorry for bothering you.
I'll hang up now.</i>

Hold on, Rajesh.

You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.

You know firsthand that breakups are hard.

Fine. If you insist on making me
a part of this, yes,

I acknowledge how painful they can be.

However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.

It provides information
from the environment

that a behavior isn't good for us.

BARRY: <i>Like when I fell in love with
that stripper and bought her a Prius.</i>

I'm just gonna push all the buttons.

Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering.

When Amy and I were broken up,
I also suffered.

And this may sound surprising,

but I'm grateful
for having gone through it.

Really?

Yes.

I believe our relationship now
is stronger than ever.

So do I.

When we were apart,
I learned how important you are to me.

And I realized that when two people
are in love, sometimes they--

Happy Valentine's Day!

(HORN BLOWING)

We are young and fun!

(HORN CONTINUES BLOWING)

I stand corrected.

Congratulations on a successful live show.

And a lovely Valentine's Day.

Cleaning up is not young and fun.

It can be. Confetti fight!

Maybe you should take a break. I got this.

Did you know the singular
of confetti is confetto?

Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

I'm glad you asked.
Amy, you have a confetto in your nose.

No, no, no, other side. There you go.

English - SDH

PENNY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

Look at all that chest hair and over bite.
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

Son of a bitch, he bit me!

I guess I'll just go
to the emergency room to be safe.

Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

that was my hypochondria.

We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

- Morning.
- Morning.

"We?" What is this?

I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.

"Continued on milk."

If you're tricking me
into making my own breakfast,

it didn't work for my mom
and it won't work for you.

"Are." "We are..."

"See spoons for more."
(DRY CHUCKLE)

What could it be? "We are Groot"?

"We are the champions"? "We are family.
I got all my sisters with me"?

Are you serious?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Yeah. Pretty positive.

That's a joke,
because the pregnancy test says that--

Oh, my God!

This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents.

We're gonna get to board planes first!

Finally gonna get to see what's
in that "family" bathroom at the mall.

(GIGGLES)

- I know, it's crazy.
- It is crazy.

Oh!

I mean, how do you prepare
for something like this?

I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.

Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.

But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?

<i>And can we afford a nanny?</i>

If we can, we can't get a pretty one
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

We can't get an ugly one
'cause it'll scare the kid.

- I don't know, Howie.
- Are we in a good school district?

You're Catholic, I'm Jewish!
What religion do we raise it?

And if it's a boy,
do we get him circumcised?

People say it's barbaric, but if we don't
it looks like a pig in a blanket.

(DEEP BREATHING)

Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

How's it gonna be okay?

Look at me. I'm a mess.

And that means
this baby's gonna be half a mess

and that's even before we screw it up

with our cut-rate,
moderately attractive nanny.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Hey Raj, I read
a couple guys in your department

may have discovered
a new planet in our solar system?

Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?

Because instead of being
in the telescope room,

I was busy making you guys
homemade jam for the holidays.

Well, you be sure to let us know

when you win the Nobel prize
for boysenberry.

- Hey.
- Hello.

- Ready to play when you are.
- Yeah, in a minute.

I actually need
to tell you guys something.

If it's thank you for the homemade jam
you got in December,

congratulations, you're the first one.

What's going on?

(CLEARS THROAT) I'm...
(CHUCKLES)

Uh... Gonna be a father.

- What? Congratulations.
- That's amazing.

Oh, no!

Why "oh, no"?

Because this changes everything.

What about comic book night?

What about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?

How can we do those things
with a child around?

Relax, there's room for two babies
in this group.

Oh, dear Lord, Penny's pregnant too?

You're the other baby.

Oh, really? Okay. Well, would a baby
have to shave once every 11 days?

Would an adult refuse
to eat his graham crackers

because one of them was broken?

I guess we'll call this a draw.

So, I'm glad you guys are here.

There's something
I want to share with you.

- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)
- Howie and I are going to--

(GASPS) Leonard says you're pregnant!

What?

"Don't say anything, act surprised
when she tells you."

All right, how you wanna do this?

- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

(LAUGHS) This is so exciting!

Yeah, yeah, real exciting.

What, are you not happy about this?

I am. Of course I am.

I'm sure it's just the hormones.

But it's weird.

Howie's the one who's been talking
about having kids for years

and I was all excited to tell him
because I thought he'd be thrilled,

but then he started to flip out
and now this feels like a bad idea,

and I'm gonna get fat.

No! No, come on. Come on,
you're not gonna get fat,

you're gonna be beautiful and glowing,
and have the cutest little baby bump ever.

Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.

Sorry, hormones.

Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was skinny.

I wouldn't make too much
out of Howard not reacting

the way you expected him to.

Yeah, I'm sure
it was just the initial shock of it all.

You're probably right.

After we talked about it
he started to calm down.

I shouldn't be raising a kid.
I don't even eat my own vegetables.

Buddy, I think you might be overreacting.

And then there's this nose. I mean...

What if he looks like me?

Or worse, (GASPS)
what if she looks like me?

Not to mention
the impact on our social circle.

Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.

Well, he could bring the baby here.

Then we'd have to baby-proof
the apartment.

Yeah, my sister has one of those
toilet locks in her bathroom.

I have two doctorates,
I still had to go in the sink.

Oh, my God, and do you have any idea
how expensive having a kid is?

Yeah, I read that in Los Angeles,
raising a child through college

can cost over a million dollars.

A million dollars?

It's like my nuts
just kicked me in the nuts.

That's it, I gotta start earning
more money right now.

I know, you could ask Bernadette
for a raise in your allowance.

This isn't a joke.

I wasn't joking.

It'll be fine, people have kids every day.
You'll figure this out.

Yeah, come on, this is great news
and you know it.

You're right, it is.
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.

Hey, you know what we should do?

All get vasectomies
so this doesn't happen to us?

Go out and celebrate.

But not your worst idea.

Hey, let's go do something
to get your mind off this.

Yeah, yeah, we should go out.

- Where?
- Uh, I don't know, a bar?

Can't drink.

We can, but all right.

Are you hungry?
How about that sushi place you love?

Doctor said I can't have sushi.

Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.

We can just, you know, stay here
and hang out in the hot tub.

Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.

Maybe you should get a new doctor.

What, he said you can't laugh either?

I'd like to propose a toast
to our friend Howard.

His big heart, his beautiful soul--

And his tight little pants
that somehow did not make him sterile.

ALL: Cheers!

Now look at this.

Now I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas
doesn't have to worry about money.

He can have all the kids he wants.

And can keep a small portion
of their heads dry.

(LEONARD CHUCKLES)

If I'm gonna have any chance
of raising this kid,

I need to come up with a big idea
to make some money.

- There's no reason you can't.
- That's easy for you to say.

You and Sheldon already came up
with your superfluid helium model.

That's just research,
we're never gonna make any money from it.

Forget helium. The real superfluid
is the fruit punch in this mug.

Reminds me of my daddy's
secret don't-tell-mama juice.

Uh, these are strong,
you should slow down.

I'll just take one last sip.

(SLURPING)

(EXHALES)

Okay, how about this for an invention?

Slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.

- How is that a new invention?
- I don't know,

all Apple does
is change the size of things

and we keep buying them.

It's true, I like my giant iPad
and my little iPad

almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.

This place is terrific.

Why have we never been here before?

Same reason we don't do
a lot of fun stuff. You.

That's some smart talk from a guy
who can't even keep his face in focus.

- Where's the bathroom?
- It's in the corner.

Excuse me.

Hey, how you doing?

I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.

Doesn't matter,
he's headed for the kitchen anyway.

Maybe that's an idea.
Guidance systems for drunk people.

They have that, it's called Uber.

Hey, in your super-cooled
helium experiments,

did you create quantum vortices?

- Yeah, why?
- Well, if you made a guidance system,

couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

Wow, never thought about that.

And since it's in a quantum state,
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks, tell me

this isn't like the best episode
of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

You may have actually
just come up with something.

- You think so?
- Yeah, I really do.

You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.

There's people cooking in it.

Think about all the fun things
you get to do when you have a baby.

Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys
and little clothes.

I kind of already do that for Howie.

And, whenever you're hungry,

you'll be in a minivan
with Cheerios all over the floor.

Oh, and I just found a new travel cup
for Sheldon.

It only lets out three at a time.

So, when did you guys decide
to get pregnant?

Well, we didn't exactly decide.

We were talking about it, and then
one night we got a little reckless.

- Oh, tell us!
- Yeah, yeah, tell us.

No, I'm embarrassed.

Come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.

Me! Me, too. I'm a grown-up
and I've done it!

Fine.

We were out one night
and things got a little spontaneous.

Well, that sounds juicy.

Well, Sheldon was going on and on
about time zones and railroad schedules,

- and I went out--
- Wait, I remember that. Hang on,

you did it at our place?

Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

- What?
- No!

I was headed to the bathroom
and I passed Howie on his way out.

Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"

but this time he said,
"Hey, let's go in here."

- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry,

but you know what it's like
when you're with your man

and one thing leads to another.

I do know what that's like, I really do.

I'm not seeing anyone
using liquid helium vortices like this.

I'm not finding anything either.

That's a good sign.

Oh, wait, I found something.

Damn, what is it?

This video, the baby panda sneezes
and the momma panda gets so scared.

Can we focus on what we're talking about?

(SIGHS) All right, look, now,
this may be the rum talking,

but as long as the unpinning rate
of the vortices

is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

the Magnus force issue
should be negligible.

Even drunk
he's still smarter than all of us.

And stronger. Who wants to see me
beat up the bartender?

I'd enjoy that.

Nah, she's a good kid.

I mean, if this is a viable thing,

we could get a patent and license it
to companies that make guidance systems.

Look at that. You've known you're gonna
be a father for less than a day

- and you're already stepping up.
- I'm telling you, you got this.

Maybe you're right.

Of course he's right.

You and I both know how hard it is
growing up without a father.

That's why I'm confident
you're gonna be the best dad you can be.

- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome.

And if he has twins, we can do
all kinds of neat experiments on them.

You guys can go in if you want.

No, we're a team. If you can't go in,
we're not going in.

Then why are we drinking?

Okay, it's not like she's got
the Christ child in there, right?

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, it's Leonard. He says Sheldon's drunk

and they're gonna do karaoke
if we wanna join them.

That sounds fun.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, no. Sheldon's drunk texting me.

What's it say?

"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."

How's that a drunk text?

Well, he used a period
instead of a question mark,

(CHUCKLING) he's so wasted.

(SINGING YOUNG MC SONG "BUST A MOVE")

(SINGING HOOK)

- (LEONARD CONTINUES SINGING INDISTINCTLY)
- Hey, guys. Congratulations!

Thank you.

Hi, how are you doing?

Oh, wonderful.

Yeah, I'm being musically encouraged
to <i>Bust a Move.</i>

If I knew what that meant,
I might just do it.

I'm really glad you're here. Can we talk?

Okay.

So, you gonna get up there later?

A microphone,

a room full of inaccurate depictions
of Polynesian religion

and a captive audience to hear about it?
You bet I am.

I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.
I want you to know...

I'm done being scared.

It's okay to be nervous, I am too.

Thank God, 'cause I was lying,

you might not have to wait nine months
to see someone soil their pants.

But I'm also really excited.

I mean it. (CHUCKLES)

Me, too.

I love you.

Mmm. And I'm not just saying that
because your breasts are gonna get bigger.

(LAUGHS)

(SINGING JUSTIN BIEBER SONG "BABY")

(SINGING THE FOUR TOPS SONG
"BABY, I NEED YOUR LOVING")

(SINGING SALT-N-PEPA SONG "PUSH IT")

I appreciate this, but you really don--

(SINGING "MY COUNTRY, 'TIS OF THEE")

I'd like to dedicate
my last song of the evening

to my wife, best friend
and now the mother of our child.

I love you, Bernie.

(SINGING PAUL ANKA SONG
"HAVING MY BABY")

You're kidding! What kind of maniacs
have coitus in someone else's bedroom?

Thank you, Pasadena, good night!

(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

That was such a fun night.

Probably 'cause you got to see
your man up there rocking the mic.

Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised
when you decided to beatbox.

Oh.

That was really an asthma attack,
I just sold it.

Well, I am so happy
for Howard and Bernadette.

Me, too.

So, you ever think about it?

Babies?

Well, I'm not in a rush,
but someday, yeah, sure.

What about you?

I think we'd make amazing parents.

SHELDON: Will you guys keep it down?

On the other hand,
we might lack a certain maturity.

English - SDH

So Sheldon, there's something
I've been wanting to talk about,

but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.

Way to narrow it down to everything.

What is it?

Well, your birthday is coming up
and you've never let us celebrate it,

and I was hoping maybe this year we could.

Oh. I suppose
that's a discussion we could have.

Okay, great. I mean,

it doesn't have to be a big party
or anything. I was just--

Where'd he go?

Wait a minute.

You mention his birthday and he vanishes?

Well, where has that information been
this whole time?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Well, where is he?

- Sheldon?
- I'll check his room.

Surprise!

- Oh, my God!
- Why?

Just one example
of how birthdays can be terrible.

Now, can we please drop this subject
and pick a new one?

You know, I suggest, "How thick can
a soup get before it becomes a stew?"

You know, that answer,
it may surprise you.

I'm sorry I brought it up.

Yeah, what is the problem?
Is it about getting older?

Please, look at this porcelain skin.

I'm like a human sink.

But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.

One day. (LAUGHS)

Right.

Can you please just tell me why?

Fine.

As you know, I have a twin sister
with whom I obviously share a birthday.

Every year we'd have a party.

No one I invited would ever come
because they didn't like me.

I'm sorry.

That part wasn't so bad,
I didn't like them either.

But then I'd inevitably spend
the whole day

being tortured by my sister's friends.

Aw. Poor thing.

When I was six, they told me
Batman was coming to my party.

I waited by the door for hours.

Closest thing to Batman I saw
was when a robin flew into the window.

You realize none of those things
would happen now?

I do.

But why do you care
if I celebrate my birthday at all?

Well,

you made my last birthday so memorable,
I wanted to return the favor.

You know, if you had a party now, you have
plenty of friends who would love to come.

And we live here, so we have no choice.

Yeah.

Very well.

You may celebrate my life
by throwing a party

with cake, presents,
and a shower of admiration and love.

But then you owe me big time.

You have any idea what
you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?

He's been fascinated
with dinosaurs lately.

Maybe we could get him a fossil.

Just don't get anything Jurassic.

He feels like that whole chunk of time
has gone Hollywood.

You know, he told a sad story
about how his sister tricked him

into thinking Batman
was coming to his party.

That's funny, let's do that.

Maybe we could get Batman
to actually show up.

You mean, some guy in a lame suit?

Or a real Batman.

Hey, Stuart,

didn't you try to get Adam West
to do a signing here once?

Yeah, but there was kind of
a scheduling conflict.

He wanted to know when he'd get paid,

and I wouldn't tell him.

Can I get his contact info?

Sure.

But just so you know, he's kind of a diva.

- He is?
- Oh, yeah.

He won't take the bus,
he won't pack his own lunch.

He won't let you spend the night
on his couch.

Okay.
So, how do you feel about party balloons?

Mylar balloons, yes.

Latex balloons, no.

Water balloons, I will jump off the roof
and aim for your car.

All right, what about music?

I enjoy marching bands
and Tibetan throat singing.

No music it is.

What kind of cake do you like?

Well, my favorite is chocolate
with strawberry frosting, three layers,

and if there's writing on it,
make sure it's not all caps.

I don't need my dessert yelling at me.

Hey, so what was Adam West like
on the phone?

Nice guy.

But it was a little weird
to hear Batman say,

"Don't ring the doorbell
or my poodles will go crazy."

You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman.

Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale

and Batman from <i>The Lego Movie.</i>

Don't say that to him.

What? He beat out George Clooney,
and that's something.

Like, I love me some Clooney.

Don't say that to anyone.

Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.

I was just glad to be invited.

To be honest, I don't always feel
like I'm part of the group.

Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.

Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?

Hello. Hope I'm not too early.

Not at all. Come on in.

And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?

Doing great!

- You-- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

Sounds like something
a member of the group might know.

Yeah.
Birthday party first, pity party later.

Are you crazy?

How can you put Michael Keaton
in front of Christian Bale?

Oh, please.

Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.

Thank you!

That's why I say Keaton's number one.

He brought a sense of humor to the role.

Well, if you're gonna factor in
a sense of humor,

well, I should be at the top of the list.

It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer,

LEGO, Bale,

and that pretty boy Clooney.

Really? You're ahead of Bale?

The man who personified the words,
"I'm Batman"?

I never had to say, "I'm Batman."

I showed up, people knew I was Batman.

Everywhere I went,
on the TV show, mall openings,

Julie Newmar's bungalow.

- I'm sold. You're ahead of Bale.
- (ALL CHUCKLING)

There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.

All those other guys
had muscles built into their costumes.

All I had in my batsuit
was 100% grade A West.

Can we just all agree
we're worried about Affleck?

- Sure.
- Yeah. Of course.

What's an Affleck?

Is there a reason
I had to leave my own apartment?

Well, I think they just want you to see it
for the first time all decorated.

But who's gonna tell them
they're doing it wrong?

Well, I'm sure they'll ask you
to give a speech,

and that's when
you just tear them a new one.

I have to say, you--
You do look good in that suit.

Oh. Thank you.

Maybe later I'll get to see you
in your birthday suit.

But this is my birthday suit.

Are you having a stroke?

Because that's the kind of thing
that just ruins a birthday party.

So, Mother, I'm surprised you came
all this way for Sheldon's birthday.

I was happy to.

He did come to my 60th.

Oh! You had a party for your 60th?

I wouldn't call it a party.

Just a few close friends.

And your sister and brother.

You know, to be fair, we did get married
in Vegas and didn't invite her.

And I never did thank you for that, dear.

- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)
- Oh!

Penny says everyone's there.
Are you ready?

(EXHALES)

I am.

Oh!

- Wait.
- Are you all right?

No, I just... I got a little lightheaded.

Oh. Do you need a minute?

(EXHALES)

No.

No, if I can walk past that pet shop
with the parrot in the window,

I suppose I can do this.

ALL: Happy birthday!

(CHEERING)

Speech, speech!

Come on, Sheldon. Say something.

Why, thank you all so much for coming.

Beverly, Wil Wheaton,

Adam West, for some reason.

Batman finally came to your party.

Happy birthday, Sherman.

SHELDON: <i>Thank you.</i>

This is all so thoughtful.

(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)

Excuse me.

I still get paid, don't I?

Okay.
I'd better go in there and talk to him.

Well, don't you think
I'm the one who should go in?

No offense, but I've known the guy
a really long time.

Well, I've, you know,
seen him without pants on.

Again, no offense, but so have I.

Well, he's seen me without pants on.

- Again, no offense--
- Okay, this is ridiculous!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

PENNY: <i>Sheldon? Can I come in?</i>

How do you know
I'm not using the facilities?

Because you email me
your bathroom schedule once a week

even though I've clicked "unsubscribe"
like a thousand times.

So, what's going on?

I don't know.

I looked around the room
and I saw all the faces and the presents,

and it was just too much.

I get that.

Hey, you wanna just bring
a few people in here?

You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,
Batman on the toilet.

It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

I know that you worked hard
to put this together.

I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

Oh... You're not ruining it.

Look, at some point, Raj will try
to get everyone to do the Electric Slide.

Now that will ruin it.

I don't think I can go back out there.

That's fine.

You know, I hate that your sister
and her friends used to torture you.

But what I hate even more is,
if I was there,

I would have tortured you, too.

Based on this pep talk,
I'd say you're still doing it.

My point is, there was a time

I never would have been friends
with someone like you,

and now,
you are one of my favorite people.

So, if what you need
is to spend your birthday in a bathroom,

I'm happy to do it with you.

Well, everyone will think I'm weird.

Sweetie, you are weird.

Everyone knows you're weird.

But they're all still here
because they care about you so much.

BARRY: <i>Hello?
Some of us need to check our hair</i>

<i>because we might have a shot
with Leonard's mother!</i>

- Leonard.
- Hey, hey, hey.

- It's been a while.
- Leslie.

Well, I can't remember
the last time we talked.

So much has changed!

Has it?

Yeah. Penny and I got married.

Oh! Congratulations!

You know, actually, I thought
you'd be living with Sheldon forever.

Yeah, well...

Don't be a stranger.

Okay, everybody.

Sheldon is gonna come back out,

but I think he's a little embarrassed,
so let's all be extra nice, okay?

What are you looking at me for?
I'm a saint. (LAUGHS)

But a sinner in the sack.

Hello, everyone.

I'd like to apologize for my behavior.

I hope it hasn't put
a damper on the party.

So, just, please, enjoy yourselves.

That's good.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.

If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.

Um...

Thank you all for coming tonight.

I know it's customary
for the birthday boy to receive presents,

but I feel like I got the greatest gift
the day he was born.

- Aw!
- Hear, hear. Yes.

Amy, that was lovely.

This is fun. Let's do more.

Someone else say
something wonderful about me.

Sheldon, I don't think everyone--

Wolowitz, perfect.
Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

Okay, then, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

Sheldon. (CHUCKLES)

We've known each other a long time,

and it is a pleasure to work with you
and call you my friend.

Little generic, keep thinking.
We'll circle back.

Wil Wheaton, go!

Sheldon, I know that we have had
our ups and downs,

but I can honestly say

that my life is so much more interesting
because you are in it.

We may have met
because you are a fan of <i>Star Trek,</i>

but I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper.

Live long and prosper, buddy.

And happy birthday.

- Cheers.
- ALL: Cheers!

That's how you do it, Wolowitz!

Now you see
why he's famous and you're not.

Sheldon,

I know the future holds
great things for you,

and we all can't wait
to see what they are.

Happy birthday, dear.

ALL: Cheers!

Someone call animal control,
there's a cougar on the loose.

Barry, stop.

Seriously, Barry, stop!

And it was Gandhi who said,

"Live as if you were to die tomorrow.

"Learn as if you were to live forever."

And it was Sheldon Cooper who said,

"Let's speed this up,
a lot of people wanna talk."

In the past,
I would've said something obnoxious

like, "Happy birthday, dumbass."

<i>But I'm not gonna do it.</i>

You and I have both grown a lot,

and it's just so nice
to see you all again.

So, happy birthday, Sheldon.

You know I hate change. Say it.

Happy birthday, dumbass!

Yes!

Happy birthday, young man.

And if any of you have enjoyed
seeing me here today,

I'm also available for Comic-Cons,

bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs--

I can't think of anything to say
that hasn't already been said,

so, here's to you, Sheldon.

- Hear, hear!
- Cheers!

Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.

What? You gotta be kidding me!

Sheldon, we've been together so long,

it's hard to remember a time
you weren't in my life.

Believe me, I try.

You make me laugh,
you make me a better scientist,

<i>you make me crazy.</i>

You're more than just my roommate.

You're my brother.

Thank you.

Happy birthday, buddy.

- Cheers.
- Cheers!

Thank you. That was wonderful.

Wait, wait, wait.
Stuart didn't get to speak.

Oh. Okay. Um...

Sheldon, I've spent
most of my life feeling invisible,

- but having you and everyone--
- AMY: <i>Hey, everybody. Listen up!</i>

You nailed it.

I've got someone who couldn't be here

but really wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

<i>Hello, Sheldon.</i>

- Professor Hawking!
- (CHUCKLES)

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

Thank you so much. I can't believe that--

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

You're singing. Well, I'm sorry.

<i>Happy birthday, dear Sheldon</i>

Uh, Professor Hawking,
if you just give us one second,

we'll light the candles
and we could all sing together.

<i>I was crushing it, but all right.</i>

Okay. While they get the cake,
Sheldon, I just wanna say,

I hope you didn't think you were
gonna get through tonight without a hug.

You know, I used to hate these hugs.

Now they're just extremely irritating.

Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.

<i>And a one, and a two...</i>

ALL: (SINGING) <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday, dear Sheldon</i>

HAWKING:...<i>dear Sheldon</i>

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

HAWKING:...<i>to you</i>

(ALL CHEERING)

So, who's taking me home?

English

PENNY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and I are right for each other.

Does this have to do with that girl
you had coffee with?

You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?

I need to come up with a big idea
to make some money.

- There's no reason you can't.
- That's easy for you to say.

You and Sheldon already came up
with your superfluid helium model.

That's just research,
we're never gonna make any money from it.

Forget helium. The real superfluid
is the fruit punch in this mug.

Reminds me of my daddy's
secret don't-tell-mama juice.

Maybe that's an idea.
Guidance systems for drunk people.

They have that, it's called Uber.

Hey, in your super-cooled
helium experiments,

did you create quantum vortices?

- Yeah, why?
- Well, if you made a guidance system,

couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

Never thought about that.

And since it's in a quantum state,
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks, tell me

this isn't like the best episode
of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

Okay, I gotta ask.
Why are you wearing a bow tie?

Well, I've never applied
for a patent before.

I wanted to make a good impression.

Is the impression
that your first name is Pee-wee?

(CHUCKLES)

Yeah, well, you're an engineer.
End of joke, burn.

Come on in, fellas.

See, he's not wearing a tie.

Well, he's a patent attorney,
maybe his tie is pending.

So, I've reviewed your paperwork.

It seems like we've got everything we need

to file a patent
for your infinite persistence gyroscope.

- That's great!
- Excellent.

So what happens next?

Well, the legal team needs to review
existing patents to avoid overlap.

Oh, I don't think there will be.

Yes, we did our own search, so...

That's nice, but I think ours
might be a bit more thorough.

(CHUCKLES) Get a load of this guy.

Can you imagine
if we make money with this?

Well, if we do, I am splurging
on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.

That old sad story, guy gets
a little money,

- goes straight up his nose.
- (CHUCKLES)

Just need you to review
and sign this document

acknowledging that you understand
the university will own 75% of the patent.

Seventy-five percent?

That's outrageous.

I mean, this is our idea
based on our research.

How can you possibly justify
owning a majority share?

It's university policy.

I know when I'm beat.

Hold on, hold on.
So the three of us do all the work

and only end up with 25%?

Dr. Hofstadter, this university's been
paying your salaries for over ten years.

Do you think we do that
out of the goodness of our hearts?

Well, until you just said
that mean thing, kind of.

And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned,

I'm afraid as a federal employee
on loan from NASA,

your name can be on the patent, but...

You're not entitled to an ownership share.

Wait, so this can turn out to be
a financial success and I get nothing?

Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.

Well, that's not fair.
We should all get plaques.

Sorry, but we can't sign this.

Come on, let's go.

Thank you for your time.

A couple of questions about the plaque--

(THEME SONG PLAYS)

So, have you been having
any morning sickness?

A little, and it doesn't help that I have
this heightened sense of smell.

What, is that a pregnancy thing?

Yeah. The other day I sniffed out
where Howie hid the Girl Scout Cookies.

No more Tagalongs, my ass.

But now you'll be able to make
your own milk to eat the cookies with.

Hey, guys. Hey, Penny,

I really appreciate you helping me
with this. I don't know what to do.

- Sure, let me see it.
- See what?

I hadn't spoken to Emily
since I broke up with her,

and she left this
on my doorstep with a note.

"Raj, I got you this before we split up
but couldn't return it

"and thought you'd like to have it.
Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily."

That's nice.

"Nice," or is she trying
to manipulate him?

I know. I mean, do I open it?
Do I return it?

Why wouldn't you open it?

Well, she was pretty mad,
for all I know it's a voodoo doll of me

with a fork stuck in my junk.

You don't think she'd actually send you
something gross or dangerous, do you?

I know one way to find out. Sniff this.

She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.

Although I am getting
a little machine oil, I think it's metal.

Come on, just open it.

You know, on <i>Game of Thrones</i>

Balon Greyjoy received
his son's genitals in a box.

Oh, never hurts to have a spare.

(BLOWS)

- BERNADETTE: What is that?
- Wow!

It's an antique sextant.

Sailors used these
to find their positions by the stars.

What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.

I know, she's so thoughtful.

See, she's trying to get you back.

Now that is exactly
what I would've gotten you

if I had any idea
what it is or what you do.

You know, I...

I have too much self-esteem

to let this girl guilt me
into getting back together with her.

You don't need to be pregnant
to smell that load of crap.

(SIGHS)

Well...

What if we go around the university
and just get the patent ourselves?

We can't. It says on their website
as long as we work there,

they have a controlling ownership
of anything we come up with.

Great. So they own my idea for a T-shirt
that says "Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."

Well, our choices are
we do this with the university

or we don't do it at all.

Either way, I get nothing.

Or if we end up making money from this,

Sheldon and I could
split our shares with you.

To be clear,
Leonard's referring to the gyroscope,

not the T-shirt and mugs.

Oh!

Now they own the mugs.

I guess that is a way around this.
You guys would be cool doing it like that?

Of course,
we would split any profits three ways.

- I'm fine with that.
- Okay, great.

It sounds like a contract
might be in order.

Sure, we could write something up.

But which one of us
should be the party who--

You can do it, Sheldon.

So stipulated!

Once I found a stash of contracts
under his bed, it was weird.

I wonder how much she spent on this.

Ooh! Let's find out.

It doesn't matter,
it's the thought that counts.

Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside,
size doesn't matter. How much she spend?

Seriously, guys, I don't wanna know.

Oh, my.

Well, come on, you can't say,
"Oh, my" and then not tell me!

These things go for $500 and up.

Damn. All I got for Valentine's Day
was a postcard saying

my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.

Okay, so she drops off a $500 gift

and she's not trying
to get back together with you?

Maybe you're right.

Or she's telling the truth
and just being nice.

Maybe you're right.
Wow, I am easy to manipulate.

Guys, it's Emily. What should I do?

Okay. Answer it.
Just be strong, and if she starts to cry,

don't make any promises,
and most importantly,

put it on speaker so we can hear.

- Hello.
- EMILY: <i>Hey, it's Emily.</i>

<i>Is this a good time?</i>

Yeah, yeah, sure. What's up?

<i>Was it okay I left that gift?
I'm really hoping we can be friends.</i>

Maybe, maybe.

<i>Um, you think you'd wanna
grab a cup of coffee?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

I'm sorry, I seem to be taking
an annoying amount of time

deciding how I feel about this!

<i>I just... I miss hanging out with you.</i>

<i>It's not like I lost a friend,
it's like I lost my best friend.</i>

(SOBBING) <i>Is there any chance
you'd wanna come over?</i>

I'm sorry.
I don't think that's a good idea.

<i>Okay.
I'm just, I'm having a really hard time,</i>

<i>but that's not your problem, that's mine.</i>

<i>I won't bother you again,</i>

<i>but please know that you'll
always have a place in my heart.</i>

(GAGGING)

<i>Bye, Raj. You're a good guy.</i>

Goodbye, Emily.

(EXHALES)

That was rough, you guys.

I know, but you did it.
I'm so proud of you.

(SIGHS) Well, anyway,
I'll leave you to your girls' night.

Are you sure you
don't wanna stay here with us?

No, I kind of
feel like being alone right now.

Well, if you change your mind,
we'll be here.

Thank you.

Say hi to Emily for us.

Will do.

Yeah, this contract looks good to me.

I'll say it looks good.
It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.

I wanna say something obnoxious,
but it is easy on the eyes.

I'm a little tired, Howie,
you ready to go?

Yeah, one sec.
I just need to sign this contract.

What is it?

Well, we ran into a problem
about my share of the patent,

so we're forming a partnership
to split anything we make equally.

Sheldon, did you draft the contract?

You bet I did.

You're gonna make out so hard tonight.

So, you're just gonna sign this
without having a lawyer look at it?

Excuse me, I've been drafting contracts
since kindergarten.

Didn't need a lawyer to get me
out of finger painting,

don't need one now.

I know, but--

Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find
a way to keep me from being cut out.

Well, I should hope so.
The whole thing was your idea.

Well, to be fair,
Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.

Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay?

Howard's invention, Sheldon's math,

my original theory that space time
was like a super-cooled liquid,

which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned

if she wasn't working on
that hangnail right now.

What?

- Honey, this is fine.
- Okay.

You wanna sign a contract
that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.

Can I talk to you in the hall?

- Sure.
- Excuse us.

Hey, Leonard.

What?

If she doesn't think
that we should apply for this patent,

she's being patently absurd.

Good one.

Okay, you got it.
See, I was afraid it was a thinker.

What are you doing?

I just wanna make sure
you've thought this through.

What's to think about?

We have an invention
and wanna move forward.

Howie, you're about to form
a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.

All right, if you're gonna
calmly make excellent points

then I don't know if I wanna talk to you.

Okay, I get it.

And it's sweet that you're worried
about me, but I can take care of myself.

I'm not worried about you,
I'm worried about me.

I don't wanna go through this pregnancy
listening to you complain about Sheldon

driving you crazy
more than you already do.

Here we go with the ironclad logic again.

You've tried to work with him before,
it hasn't gone well.

Why is this time gonna be any different?

Is the fetus helping you?
'Cause that's cheating.

(CELLPHONE RINGING)

- Hello.
- Hey, Raj. It's Claire, how are you?

Hi, I'm good. Really good.

Well, I don't know why I said
"really good," I'm just regular good.

I really just wanted to sound confident.

And that "really" was a real really,

not a fake "really"
like the first "really."

Really?

I don't know,
I lost track and I missed my exit.

So, uh, so what's up?

Well, last time we talked I had just
gotten back together with my boyfriend

and I wanted to let you know
that things didn't work out.

Really?
I'm sorry, I swear I know other words.

So if you were still interested--

Yes! Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably.

I'm not even sure what the last one means,
but it's another word and I know it.

So, when do you wanna meet up?

Um, I'm almost off work,
what are you doing now?

Right now? Well...

Well, actually, to be completely honest,

I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend
because she's having a tough time,

<i>but it's not like
we're getting back together or anything.</i>

Let me guess,
the worst part about breaking up

is that she doesn't have
her best friend to talk to anymore?

That's exactly what she said!
How do you know that?

I'm a girl,
that's like page one out of the playbook.

Any chance
you could send me a PDF of that playbook?

Been out there awhile.

Hope everything's okay.

I wonder what they're talking about.

If you guys would shut up,
I could tell you.

Oh, be cool, be cool, be cool.

- Hey.
- Hello.

Hey. You guys all right?

Yeah. But, um, we were talking and...

I'm a little concerned about
the three of us forming a partnership.

Are you suggesting
a limited liability corporation?

'Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.

Sheldon, my concern is not with the money
or anything, it's with how you treat me.

Well, I believe
I'm treating you generously.

That's why I've stipulated
in the contract that your contributions

to our invention
are as valuable as my own.

Are you saying that his contributions
aren't as valuable as yours?

No, I'm not saying that,
because I kept saying that this morning

and Leonard said stop saying that.

See, this is what happens
every time we work together.

You know, hang on. What if Sheldon
had no choice but to be respectful?

What? Is there a switch on the back
of his neck we don't know about?

No. What I'm saying is,
you could add a clause to the contract

that he can't make fun of Howard.

How would you enforce it?

Oh, please, any contract I sign

is enforced by my own personal code
of ethics.

- And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
- Yeah, that, too.

And scoot over,
part of your shadow is on my spot. Move.

Howard, what do you think?

I'm on board.

Good. I'll add it right now.

Oh, baby, it's addendum time!

(LINE RINGING)

- EMILY: <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Emily, listen.

I've been thinking and I'm not sure
it's a good idea that I come over.

Oh.

(CRYING) Okay, I understand.

No, no. Please don't cry.

Okay, I'll stop!

- Hello?
- Hey, so listen, Claire, change of plans.

Fine, do what you want,
but she's playing you.

I don't think so,
she sounded pretty upset.

You mean like, "I was just really
looking forward to seeing you."

"I'm having such a rough day."

Emily, listen.

I'm sorry, but I can't come by.

Why not?

I think we both know if I come over
we're gonna get back together and--

I told you I needed a friend.

What do you think is happening here?

Call you right back.

The revisions I made start on page four.

That is a lot of "whereupons."

You should see
the Valentine's Day card he gave me.

"Article three.
As it pertains to this project,

"Dr. Sheldon Cooper
promises to abstain from all insulting

"or disrespectful language
directed toward Howard Wolowitz,

"including but not limited to
mockery of engineering, his height,

"his hair, his wardrobe

"and his insane belief
that the <i>Ghost Rider</i> movie

"was, quote, 'Not that bad.""

Hang on, maybe there should be
a no insult clause about me, too?

- Do you still like cilantro?
- Yeah.

You're tying my hands here.

All right, let's sign this.

Wait, wait, wait.
What are these changes on page six?

Sheldon, what did you do?

I should've known.

"Twenty-five percent of profits
due to Sheldon Cooper

"will be allocated to a scholarship fund

"for the first born child
of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz."

Sheldon, that's so nice.

That beats the onesie
I was gonna get them from babyGap.

That's very generous, Sheldon.

Oh, I've always valued education
over money.

And the very fact that you needed
a written guarantee of respect

made me realize how dismissive
I've been of your contributions.

I appreciate that.

And I just hope that this scholarship
can rescue your child

from the subpar education
and menial life of an engineer.

- Sheldon.
- What? I didn't sign it yet.

I hear what you're saying,
but I've known Emily a long time

and think she deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

All right, it's your life,
but you know how this is gonna end.

As a matter of fact, I do.

I'm gonna comfort her
because I'm a caring and decent friend

who's happy to be there
when she needs someone to talk to.

Good talk.

English - SDH

(VOICE BREAKING) <i>I understand your e-mail.</i>

(STAMMERS) Can you repeat that?
You're breaking up.

(VOICE BREAKING)
<i>I didn't understand your e-mail.</i>

Ah, yeah, well,
I had to get a little creative

because the "S," "R" and "M" keys
on my laptop stopped working.

"Deaw Aby,

"could you pleathe dwive be
to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"

So, is that a yes?

Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer?

You know that one's out-of-date.

Oh. But I like this computer.

The video is failing
and the sound is cutting out.

(STAMMERS) I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

(VOICE BREAKING) <i>The video is failing
and...is cutting...</i>

I'm sorry one more time,
the sound is cutting out.

What? I can't read that,
the video is failing.

<i>Get a...computer.</i>

What?

<i>Get...new...</i>

What?

- (GROANS LIGHTLY)
- (PHONE RINGING)

- Hello?
- AMY: <i>Get a new computer!</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

This is cool.

When was the last time
you and I built something together?

Scientifically? Little over a year ago.

LEGOs? Last week in my room.

If there was a Nobel Prize

for <i>Millennium Falcons</i> that fall apart
when you pick them up we'd be set.

Hey, guys.

- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hey.

We heard there were some sexy scientists
working hard all weekend.

Yup, so we brought you some lunch
and we are gonna go look for 'em.

Soup, sandwiches and emasculation,
just like my mom used to make.

- So, how's it goin'?
- Good. Slow.

There's a lot of tedious set-up,

but once we get through that
it should go quicker.

Is there anything we can do to help?

You know what,

this part isn't that technical,
you actually could.

Wow. Really?
Called my bluff, all righty then.

Can we really help?

Yeah, while we finish soldering
these boards,

it'd be great if you guys could wrap
these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

I'll show you how to do one.

Hey, wouldn't it be funny if
after all your years of hard work,

I'm the one who makes a scientific
breakthrough? (SNICKERING)

He doesn't think that's funny.

(STATIC)

(GASPS)

(SIGHS)

(DOOR KNOCK)

I got here as quickly as I could.

You're too late.

(FUNERAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Sheldon, this is silly.

You got emotional
when that lab monkey died.

That lab monkey told me he loved me
in sign language.

(STAMMERS)

Great, now I'm gonna have that song
in my head all day.

Look, I'm sorry for your loss,

but I think I have something
that might make you feel better.

I got you a new computer!

(SNICKERING)

How could you do that?

Do what?

Choosing a new laptop
is an incredibly personal ritual.

But, you have taken away
weeks of agonizing thought,

tedious research,
sleepless nights filled with indecision.

(STAMMERS)

Haven't I lost enough today?

Well, the guy at the store
said this one is great.

Oh... <i>The guy!</i>

Oh, pardon me, I didn't realize
you'd spoken to <i>the guy.</i>

Tell me, did <i>the guy</i> choose one
with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?

- Yes.
- Yeah?

Well, did <i>the guy</i> make sure

that this has
a one terabyte solid-state drive?

- Yes.
- Yeah?

Well, was <i>this guy</i> Rick from
Computer Solutions on Colorado?

Yes.

Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.

After you wrap the body
in reflective tape,

the ends get Teflon tape
so we can get a tight seal.

- Like this? Oh.
- Yeah, perfect.

And it helps to have small,
delicate fingers.

So, don't be discouraged
if you can't do it

as fast as me and Howard. (CHUCKLING)

I don't know if we have enough solder
to finish these circuit boards.

We had a full spool yesterday.

What can I say, I play hard,
I solder even harder.

Sometimes he solders at home
with his shirt off,

it's like a beer commercial.

Well, we gotta make a run
to the hardware store.

How can you call yourself a scientist
and run out of solder?

(CHUCKLING) Well, funny story.

So, we have plenty of
the 60-40 tin to lead ratio solder,

but the spools look a lot
like the 63-37 tin to lead--

Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you.

That is not a funny story.

You wanna come with us?

Kinda getting into the groove here.

Yeah, you guys run to the store

and let the women
handle the science for a change.

- Okay, we'll be back as soon as we can.
- (PENNY CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

(CLEARS THROAT)

Okay, so what is solder?

I suppose I should set this up.

Or would you like to rob me of that, too?

Knock it off,

or I'll start making W-H sounds
for words that just have a W.

- You wouldn't.
- Watch me.

Fine, I'm sorry.

Thank you for the thoughtful gift.
I really do appreciate it.

Well, as you know, I had become
attached to my old laptop,

but I'm sure, in time, this one--

(GASPS) Jeepers-creepers,
that started up fast!

I thought you might like it.

Look at the 4K resolution!

Next time we Skype,
I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.

Or you could just look into my eyes.

But you only have two eyes,
you got a lot of nostril hairs.

Well, you know, as long as you're happy.

I am. (CHUCKLES)

And Rick said you could bring in
your old one to recycle it.

Oh. No, no, no, thank you.

But he said you can get store credit.

Well, no, I don't want to recycle it

and, you know, I don't want store credit.

- But, why wouldn't--
- Can we please change the subject?

Okay, how about we change it to
why you're being weird about this?

I'm not being weird.

It's hard to explain.

Sheldon, just tell me.

It might be easier to show you.

Okay.

We have to take your car.

All right.

And I'm gonna need you to sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

Well, I signed one before
we slept together, why not now?

Penny says they're having fun
working on the prototype.

Remember when her fun was
night clubs and drinking games?

I know, I'm lowering the bar so slowly

this time next year
she'll have a coin collection.

Excuse me,

you guys interested in a free screening
of an upcoming movie?

- Sorry, we can't.
- Well, hang on.

What movie is it?

Oh, I can't tell you,
but it does star Will Smith.

Wait, I bet it's <i>Suicide Squad.</i>
Let's check it out.

What about the girls?

Penny just said they're having fun.

Honestly, you wanna wrap tape around
a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?

- Okay, we'll take 'em.
- Okay.

LEONARD: But I swear, if it's Will Smith
in <i>Shark Tale 2,</i>

it better be at least
as good as the original.

I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?

I moved here from Nebraska
to be an actress

and now I'm sitting
in an engineering lab at Caltech

helping to build a prototype
for a high-tech guidance system.

It is crazy.

It's also crazy that I've made 14 of these
and you've made three.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Hey, where are the guys?

Oh, they went to the store to get solder,

which is metal you melt
to make science things.

Since when do you work on weekends?

I'm an astrophysicist,
the stars don't take a day off.

You were home alone
and had no one to play with?

Well, the cleaning lady was there,
but she doesn't like me.

You need any help?

Not with Lightning McQueen here.

I think we're good.

Okay, that's cool.

Guess everybody's involved
in this project but me.

So, see ya.

I feel bad,
should we have asked him to stay?

RAJ: (GIRLY VOICE) Yes.

Will you please tell me where we're going?

Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.

I'm driving the car, I need to know.

Right.

So where are we going?

No, I meant turn right and you missed it.

Maybe you do need to know.

(LEONARD SIGHS)

What are we gonna tell the girls?

- It's not a problem.
- I mean, without lying.

And now you've made it a problem.

Come on, we're a couple of smart guys,

I'm sure we can come up
with a way to explain this

that doesn't make us look bad.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, the boys had to drive
all the way to San Bernardino

for the solder and got a flat.

- (PHONE CHIMES)
- They bought it.

But we're gonna have to
put the spare on before we go back.

Oh, you're good at this.

(CHUCKLES) Well, I lie a lot.

Hey, guys, thank you for being
a part of our test screening.

You're about to be one of the first
audiences to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

You were right.

I keep telling you,
good things happen to bad people.

(CHUCKLING)

We're gonna get started
in a couple of minutes, enjoy.

Who you texting?

Raj. He really wants to see this movie.

- Oh, he'll never make it in time.
- I know.

I wanna make him feel bad.

"Ha-ha, Leonard and I are
about to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

"Spoiler alert.
When I see you I'm gonna spoil it."

You're a good friend.

(CHUCKLING)

(PHONE CHIMES)

Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

Would you ladies please
leave the room for a moment?

Why?

I need to rub my genitals
on their prototype.

What's going on?

Leonard and Howard don't have a flat.
They went to the movies. Look.

- Un-freakin'-believable!
- Son of a bitch.

You know what? I'm gonna let them know

that I'm here with you
and that they're busted.

No, you know what, don't. Don't.

Let's let them think
they're getting away with it.

Yeah, let's see how deep a hole
they could dig for themselves.

- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.

I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat,
but I like it.

Why do you have a storage unit?

(SIGHS) Just wait.

How long have you had it?

Just wait.

Do you want me to hold that computer?

Just... You know what, actually, yes,
thank you.

Welcome to my fortress of shame.

I'm sorry, what am I looking at?

Basically everything I've ever owned.

Um, every book, every T-shirt,

every piece of broken electronics,
just... All of it.

All of it?

I have a Ziploc bag
filled with all my old Ziploc bags.

Okay. Well...

I would like to tell you

that there is nothing here
to be ashamed of.

So I'm gonna need a minute.

All right, how are we gonna
play this when they return?

I know, you guys should
totally be making out with me.

Sweetie, I know you think
jokes like that are funny,

but do you really think you could
handle makin' out with both of us?

(INHALES DEEPLY) No, ma'am.

Okay, okay, how about this.

They don't know you're here with us,
so you hide in the closet.

When they show up, we'll hear
whatever their dumb story is

about where they were,
we'll pretend to believe them,

and just when they think
they got away with it, you jump out.

Yeah, that's pretty good.

I love it! I'll be all like, "Busted!"

And they'll be like, "What?"

And then we'll all be like, "Oh, yeah!"

Yeah, I get it, I wouldn't make out
with me either.

In here is every clock radio
I've ever owned.

Calculators, VHS tapes,
yeah, sporting equipment.

You have sporting equipment?

Well, it's a golf ball
that my brother threw at my head.

You can still feel the dent.

It's right next to the hockey-puck dent.

Okay, why do you have a bin of pinecones?

I used to collect them as a child.

The spiral of scales open
in the Fibonacci sequence.

A fact that, when you tell your brother,
gets a golf ball thrown at your head.

So, why do you feel
you need to save these things?

I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

but every time I think
of throwing anything away

my ears start to ring
and I get butterflies in my stomach.

And then it feels like
the butterflies get eaten by rats.

- And then the rats get eaten by--
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

It ends with dinosaurs.

I'm sorry if you think less of me.

I don't.

Really?

Because every time I come in here,
I think less of me.

Why?

Because I'm a fraud.

I purport to be a man of the mind.

I've been such a vocal champion
of The Singularity,

but how can I leave my body behind
and become one with the Internet

when I've never even thrown
a toothbrush away?

It's okay, Sheldon, you know,
I've saved a lot of weird things, too.

Like what?

Well...

Um, did you know I have a microscope slide
with a little bit of tissue

from the first brain I ever dissected.

I have an old teddy bear I secretly
wiped my nose on for years.

It's not a contest.

- Okay, here they come.
- Go hide.

Oh, man, when I come out of the closet
I'm gonna nail those guys.

Yeah, I heard it, shut up.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Hey, what's this?

Listen, we did a stupid thing.

We went to a movie and lied about it,

but we feel bad
and wanna make it up to you.

So, these are for you,
and if you're not too mad,

we'd love to take you guys to dinner.

Yeah, anywhere you want.

Well, thank you for being honest.

Yeah, you know, I wanna be upset,

but we did kinda have fun
working on the prototype.

RAJ: <i>Don't forgive them! Stay mad at them!</i>

What is he doing in there?

Busting you!

It's okay, they apologized.

Yeah, it's fine.

Well, this is kinda anti-climactic.

You know what wasn't anti-climactic?
The end of the movie! Get this.

No spoilers! No spoilers!

And he's back in the closet.

- Ready for dinner?
- Yeah.

Should we invite Raj?

RAJ: (GIRLY VOICE) <i>Yes.</i>

So, no one else knows about this?

Only you.

Thank you for trusting me.

What good is having a girlfriend

if you can't unload your
psychological sewage on her?

That's me, your emotional outhouse.

You know, if you ever decide
you want to do something about this,

I'm here for you.

Thank you.

I wouldn't even know how to begin.

Baby steps, I guess.

I suppose I could try
getting rid of the golf ball.

Oh. Okay.

I will always have the dent
to remember it by.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

(SIGHS)

You did it.

Do you feel okay?

Actually, yes, I do.

Well, I'm proud of you.

Thanks.

I'm glad I told you
about the storage unit.

Well, I feel closer to you now.

I feel closer to you, too.

You know, it's still a couple of hours
until my bed time.

What did you have in mind?

You look amazing.

I mean, this resolution is remarkable.

<i>I really had to go home for this?</i>

Yes, but it's like
you're right here in the room.

<i>And yet, I'm not.</i>

But I feel like I could just
reach out and touch you.

<i>And yet, you can't.</i>

I know!

SHELDON: <i>It's nice to get back to nature.</i>

<i>Why don't I do this more often?</i>

(DOOR OPENING)

What a beautiful forest.

(GASPS) Hello, little butterfly. Mmm.

What's your name-- Oh!

(CHUCKLES) What you doin'?

I was enjoying some virtual reality.
You ruined it with your actual face.

What am I smelling?

It's car air freshener.
I was simulating the smell of the forest.

That's not what the forest smells like.

Well, how would I know?

Why are you pretending
to be outdoors? You hate it.

Oh, Amy showed me a compelling study

that demonstrated the cognitive benefit
of spending time in the wilderness.

Buddy, I am ready to
drive you into the wilderness

anytime you want and leave you there.

Well, make your jokes,

but some of the participants who spent
four days in the woods,

away from all technology,

reported a 50% gain
in reasoning skills upon their return.

Okay, if that's true, why aren't there
more genius squirrels?

You may need this more than I do.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

- Here's your tea.
- (SHELDON GASPS)

You don't sneak up on a guy
when he's sitting on a log.

You know,
if you really wanna be in nature,

why don't we rent a cabin?

I'm sorry, when did you even get here?

You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear

that a doctor I work with
keeps offering me.

Because he's hitting on you?

- She.
- Oh, good.

But I could get her.

Look, we could all go for the weekend.
It'll be fun.

Yeah... (CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me.

Here, look up fun, get back to me.

You and I could still go
and have a nice weekend.

Sure.

Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.

(SCOFFS) I hardly think so.

But you be sure and say hello
to all the mosquitos, bees, bears,

snakes, possums, poison oak--

Oh, and last but not least,
teenagers with guitars.

I'll see if it's available.

You know, if that study's real, Leonard
might come back smarter than you.

- Are you trying to manipulate me?
- Yes.

- Well done, it worked. We're going.
- Yay!

(GUNSHOTS ON TV)

Come on, Raj, give me a bag.

No, no, you're pregnant.

The only thing you carry
is our hope for a better tomorrow.

Hey, where you been?

Ah, Raj took me to the baby doctor
and then we swung by the grocery store.

Did you get graham crackers?

I mean... (STAMMERING) Is the baby okay?

Yes and yes.

I didn't know you needed help
running errands today.

- I didn't, but Raj volunteered.
- Really?

Yeah, ever since
you told him I was pregnant,

he's really been making a fuss over me.

Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.

Bernie, I just forwarded you

a list of the top five lactation
consultants in Los Angeles.

I know my favorite,
but I'd love to hear what you think.

And it just got weird.

- Hey, Amy's downstairs.
- Okay. One sec.

Uh, what... What you got goin' on here?

I bought a baseball cap.

I can see that. What team did you get?

Uh, Hufflepuff from <i>Harry Potter.</i>

Well, we'll be in the woods.

I'm ready to go. (SIGHS)

Anything you'd like to say to him?

Nice hat, Sheldon.

Thanks.

Why you so mean to me?

(WOMAN SCREAMING IN PAIN
ON TABLET)

What the hell are you watching?

Raj found all these
childbirth videos online.

This one is of a woman
giving birth in a river.

Okay, that is the least Jewish thing
I've ever seen in my life.

You feel like Raj is getting a little
carried away with all the baby stuff?

I don't think so, he just wants to be
part of the experience.

All right. If you say so.
What's in the box?

It's an ultrasonic microphone
so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.

Oh! That's cool. Can we try it?

Well, actually, Raj ordered it.

He made me promise to wait
till he was here.

So he can be part of the experience?

Yeah.

Surprised he let us conceive without him.

It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.

It's so cute and rustic up here.

I know, did you see they still have
a video rental place?

It's like Colonial Williamsburg.
(CHUCKLES)

Well, cell service is down to one bar,

so if anyone needs medical attention

or to tell a stranger their political
views are stupid, now's the time.

Have you ever been off the grid before?

Once. The battery ran out on my phone.
I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.

I was afraid he was gonna eat me.

Raj just pulled up.

(SIGHS) I'm gonna say something to him.

Leave it alone. He means well.

So, you don't think
he needs to rein it in a little?

No, not really.

You're not concerned he's acting like
somehow this is his kid, too?

He's just trying to be supportive.

Just supportive.
Not over-the-top in any way?

No.

RAJ: (IN SING-SONG VOICE) Hello!

You saw him carrying that.

Astronauts saw him carrying that.

(GASPS) This place is great!

So nice of that doctor
to just let you use it.

Well, she is taking me
to an Indigo Girls concert,

so hold that thought.

Okay, well, should we
check each other for ticks?

Sheldon, all we did
was walk in from the car.

Oh, well, suit yourself.
Who wants to check me?

On the other hand, safety first.

Wow! It's really coming down.

Yeah, this sucks.

And there goes our hike.

Oh! Not our hike!

Now we have to stay safe and warm.

You know, we could still go.
A little rain isn't gonna kill us.

Have you been outside in the rain
with Sheldon?

- No.
- You'll wish it would kill you.

So what do we do now?

They have some board games.

Yeah, most of the Jenga pieces are missing
and the Scrabble only has seven tiles.

So, unless you want to build
an unimpressive structure

with the word SNERPF next to it, move on.

Hey, let's light a fire.

Ooh! That sounds cozy.

I don't think I've lit a real fire before.

It's basic thermodynamics.
I'm sure we could figure that out.

I could stack the logs conically
to facilitate air flow.

That would maximize oxygen
for optimal combustion.

Right, so all we need is to--

Got it.

Scientists made that.

Look, Raj.

You're my best friend in the world,

and I really appreciate
your enthusiasm about the baby.

Please, my pleasure.

And, of course, Howie and I both
want you to be a part of all this.

But we have to set some boundaries.

I don't understand.

The three of us aren't having this baby.

Just the two of us.

Oh!

Okay. Yeah, I get it.

I'll back off.

- Thanks for understanding.
- Of course.

Give you guys some space.

Let me just get this out of your way.

Oh! (GROANS)

- You need some help?
- No, I got it.

(CLATTERING)

- Raj, Raj, wait.
- Please, Bernadette.

Let me leave with my dignity.

Hey, you guys wanna play a drinking game?

(STUTTERS) We'll never win.

You always play the drinking game.

Not <i>the</i> drinking game, <i>a</i> drinking game.

To be fair, good at both.

- What's the game?
- All right.

It's called Never Have I Ever.
The rules are simple.

Someone says something they've never done,

but if you have done it, you take a drink.

I've never played that before.

Hey, now wait, have we started,
do I drink, what is happening?

Okay, just calm down, I'll go first.

All right, let's see. Never have I ever...

She's trying to think of something
she's never done before,

this could take a while.

Very funny.

Okay, never have I ever...

Yeah, you know what,
let's just circle back.

Okay, I'll go.
Never have I ever been arrested.

So I drink?

No, it's only if you've done it.

Got it.

I can't believe you've been arrested.

Hmm, I can't believe Penny hasn't.

(CHUCKLING)

Sheldon, what did you do?

Well, I'm not proud of it,
but... I jaywalked.

Oh, no, it's like a horror movie,
we're trapped in a cabin with a maniac!

I'm surprised you would do that.

No, I, I crossed in
the middle of the street.

And normally I wouldn't, but I saw
an aggressive looking girl scout and...

Yeah, it was the heart of cookie season.

Anyway, there was a police officer,
and he witnessed the whole thing.

What, he arrested you for that?

Hmm? Uh, no, he didn't do anything.

So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk,
why aren't you doing your job? You know?

(STUTTERS) "Maybe I should arrest you
for, for impersonating a police officer."

And then you got arrested.

Oh, and how.

I feel like I just made
a horrible mistake.

Yeah.

But on the other hand,
I didn't kick him out of our lives.

I just asked him to back off a little.

Yeah.

What? You gonna cry?

Yeah!

Baby hormones or actually sad?

I can't tell anymore! (SOBS)

I'll go get him.

And bring back the bear! (SOBS)

This game's dangerous,
I could get you in trouble.

How?

Well, never have I ever used
Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.

Fine. Is that how you play this?
All right.

Never have I ever come up
with a nickname for my own genitals.

Never should have told you about
Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Okay, my turn.

Um...

Never have I ever completely rocked
my girlfriend's world in bed.

Amy.

You know the rules. Drink.

- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Yeah, go ahead.

That's right.

All right, my turn. Um...

Oh! I know.

Never have I ever kept
a secret bank account

because I think
my wife can't handle money.

Did I win? I feel like I won.

I can't believe this.

You realize I make more money than you.

Yeah, I know. But this isn't a big deal.

It's just a little savings I put aside.

We're married.
We're supposed to share everything.

What? You mean, like,
your massive credit card debt?

(DOOR SLAMS)

I'm calling it, I won.

I appreciate the apology,
but it's really not necessary.

I overstepped my bounds.

No, Raj. You've been great.

I just need to start doing my part
around here.

BERNADETTE: <i>I hear that.</i>

Well, if that's the case,
is there anything I can do to help?

Well, not right now, but we could
try out that microphone you got us

and listen to the baby's heartbeat.

Really? (STUTTERS)
It's okay if I listen with you?

Of course.

(GASPS) Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly
on your stomach?

Hey, look at that, it's weird again.

(DOOR OPENING)

Okay, you have every right to be mad.

And what you said is true,
you do make more money than me.

So I had no right to do what I did.

And I'm so sorry.
I hope you can forgive me.

How long have you had this secret account?

A couple years, but I just put a few bucks
aside every month for emergencies.

Well, how much you got in there?

$6,427,

$47 once my nana's
birthday check gets here.

My God, Leonard, do you know what
I could do with that kind of money?

No, I do, and that's why I hid it.

What good is it if you don't use it?

Uh, you have shoes you love
but never wear.

I have money I love but never spend.

We're kind of a cute couple that way.
(CHUCKLES)

Again, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

Well, I have a secret
I've been keeping from you, too.

Is it a secret bank account?
'Cause that would be awesome. (CHUCKLES)

I hate my job.

Really? Why?

Because I don't feel good
flirting with doctors for sales.

I mean, I know I make a lot of money,
but I haven't been happy for a while.

(SIGHS) Why didn't you tell me?

Because I know how important it is to you
that I'm having some success.

That's not true.

Okay, really? So you'd be fine

if I went back to acting
and waiting tables again?

If that's what you wanna do, yes.

- Well, it's not what I wanna do.
- Oh, yes! (CHUCKLES)

Doesn't matter what I want.

Look, this job
is gonna get me out of debt,

so I'm gonna do the grown-up thing
and see it through.

Wow. That is the grown-up thing.

I guess.

I love you.

I love you, too.

You know...

Never have I ever made love
in the forest while it was raining.

Well, guess I gotta drink.

- All right, here we go.
- (ALL CHUCKLING)

(STATIC ON THE SPEAKER)

I'm not hearing anything.

Give me a second.

Are you sure you can do this?

Hey, who found four dollars and change
on the beach with his metal detector?

I buried it there so we could go home.

(RAPID HEARTBEAT ON SPEAKER)

- (GASPS) Hey, that's it.
- (CHUCKLES)

Whoa.

Isn't that the best?

You guys made a person.

(HEARTBEAT CONTINUES)

We did.

And I like to think I helped.

(WHISPERS) You didn't.

Oh, um, never have I ever drunk milk
past its expiration date.

Never have I ever
canceled a dentist appointment.

Oh, uh, never have I ever
put my foot in the ocean.

Never have I ever
honked if I liked anything.

Oh, uh...

Never have I ever thrown,
caught or touched a Frisbee.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Never have I ever put salt on my food
without trying it first.

Oh!

Never have I ever
pushed all the buttons in an elevator.

(GASPS)

Well, we all have a past.

English - SDH

I have a question about Batman.

Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.

Yeah.

Man-Bat is a part-man, part-bat hybrid.

Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man
to fight crime,

would he be Man-Batman?

No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman
that was bitten by a radioactive man?

But Batman is a man.

You're talking about a man
who would have the powers of a man.

That's just Man-Man.

Isn't Man-Man just Man?

But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?

Well, that's just Batman.

No, if a man dresses as a bat,
that's Batman,

but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,
that's Bat-Man-Man.

(PHONE CHIMES)

So, does that answer your question?

Oh, I haven't asked it yet.

Oh, that's Claire, gotta run.

Thought you were back with Emily?

Uh, actually, I'm seeing both of them.

You mean like through their window
from behind a bush?

No, I'm actually dating two women.

Later.

(SCOFFS) Really?

The guy who for years
couldn't even talk to women

is suddenly going out with two of them?

- How is that possible?
- HOWARD: <i>I know.</i>

Scientists have tried to reproduce it
with computational models,

but in each case, the world blows up.

Seriously, that guy's dating two women?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

What? Why did you get a party sub?

People are coming over. It looked fun.

Oh, we're only watching <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

No, a party sub implies it's a party.

Your attendance implies it's not.

I like a party as much as the next man.

As long as the next man
doesn't like a party.

Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is
our quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

Sheldon, we don't need a meeting
every three months.

Well, it sounds like the kind of thing
one would bring up

at a quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

Lucky for you it's tomorrow.

Well, you know what? I'm not going.

Well, you have to go.

It's Penny's first time leading
the Pledge of Allegiance.

This meeting is a waste of time.

Whether we make the switch from
Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran

should not require
parliamentary procedure.

You realize one of them
has sugar on the raisins.

You're the only one who eats them!

And yet you get to weigh in!

Democracy! It's pretty cool, isn't it?

I'm not going. You can't make me.

Well, we'll just see about that.

What is the problem?

He says he's not coming to
the Roommate Agreement meeting tomorrow.

What?
Why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?

You have fun. I will not be attending.

Well, fine we don't have to have
a Roommate Agreement meeting

- if you don't want to.
- Thank you.

Of course, this will require a vote.

Unfortunately, my official gavel
is in my bedroom.

- But luckily, I have my travel gavel.
- (GAVEL CLICKS)

You're being ridiculous.

There's a motion on the floor,
"I'm ridiculous."

Do we have a second?

Mmm? Mmm?
There is no second. The motion is denied.

Next time, make sure
you have the votes first.

- That was embarrassing.
- (BANGS GAVEL)

Can you please talk to him?

Oh, why are you fighting him on this?

Because I am tired of him
always getting his way.

We don't need a stupid meeting,
we don't even need a Roommate Agreement,

and I hope that sandwich
does cause a party!

Well, I will still come to your meeting.

You... Well, I should hope so.
Tomorrow's picture day.

Why are you taking his side?

Because it's important to him.

And when we signed the Roommate Agreement,
we made a deal.

Yeah, you keep talking like that,
you're gonna make color guard.

(GUN FIRING IN VIDEO GAME)

- Man, I'm worn out.
- (INDISTINCT YELLING ON TV)

I know.

Imagine if we were actually moving.

No, it's just, ever since I started dating
Claire and Emily at the same time,

it's exhausting.

You're exhausted?

Try folding every five pages
in a pregnancy book,

so your wife thinks you read it.

But, dude, you're so lucky.

Getting to stay at home at night
with the woman you love.

- I guess I am lucky.
- You are.

Because dating two women...

I mean, I can't even remember
the last time I slept in my own apartment

I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at Claire's?
Am I at Emily's?

"Is there a third girl
I've forgotten about?

Like, "Where am I?"

- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?

Good. A little tired.

I feel you.
I've been dating multiple women.

You sure you don't wanna come watch
<i>Game of Thrones</i> with us?

You guys have fun.

I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed
with a book.

Oh, that sounds great. A bed to yourself.

Can't even remember what that's like.

Are you up-to-date on <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

Mmm. I think so.

Dragons, snow zombies,
and all the hot guys are dead.

Oh, I don't know.

Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy
who has genitals cut off.

Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.

Leave me alone.

If it's because you lost a stick,
I know where it went.

Not funny.

You know you're gonna make up with him.
Can we just skip to that part?

Oh, of course,
because I'm the only adult around here.

Really? "The only adult"?

Yeah, that's right.

Tonight, I'll be watching a show
rated M.A.,

and that stands for
"mature audiences," buster.

Yeah, you would think the "only adult"

wouldn't let something silly
ruin our entire night.

And I'd think you'd understand
why I'm annoyed.

You... All of this could be avoided
if you'd just come to the meeting.

I don't want to.

Oh, it's just a meeting.
One simple meeting.

Stop saying "meeting"!

(SINGING GIBBERISH)

I brought my famous spinach dip.

No, Amy, just one second.

I'm not sure if I'm hoping
for a boy or a girl.

I mean, If it's a boy, I'm gonna have
to teach him to play catch, (CHUCKLES)

which means I'm gonna have to google
how to play catch.

(CHUCKLES)

And if it's a girl... (CHUCKLES)

I mean, they're so innocent,
and you know how guys are.

- Totally. Guys are the worst.
- (SIGHS)

Look at me.

I let Emily make me a frittata,

and I kept the leftovers
in Claire's fridge that night.

I'm such a dog.

(SIGHS)

There you go again.

I'm sorry.
Have I been complaining about it too much?

No, actually what you're doing
is pretending to complain,

but really trying to brag.

How could you say that?

(IMITATING RAJ)
"Oh, I wish I could enjoy a cup of tea

"without a naked girl
bouncing up and down on me."

I never said that.

"Don't you hate it when you can't remember

"whose bra it is
you found wedged in your couch?"

Okay, that I said.

But that's a real problem!

You give a girl another woman's bra,

and you will not
be having sex with her that night.

Maybe the other girl, but not her.

What's going on with him?

Oh, he's all bent out of shape about
having a Roommate Agreement meeting.

Apparently, perfect attendance
isn't cool anymore.

Don't worry, he'll come around.

Oh, I get why he's annoyed.

Oh, then you don't understand
what's happening.

See, Leonard refused to participate

in a mandatory quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

This is what a generation raised
on Bart Simpson looks like.

You love <i>The Simpsons.</i>

I love Lisa Simpson.

Well, I know how he feels.

I never enjoyed
our Relationship Agreement meetings.

(GASPS) Wait. You were pretending?

Sorry.

No.

I don't believe you. No, I could tell.

"Oh, Sheldon,

"I never thought re-filing a matter
in a standing subcommittee

"could be so fascinating."

Hmm. What do you think?

You don't know?

Hey, did I say something to upset you?

No, I'm fine.

Really?
Because usually we walk side by side,

and I just went up two flights of stairs
staring at your bottom.

Just drop it.

Okay, I think I see what's happening here.

- You're jealous of me.
- Oh...

Please. What could you possibly have
that I would be jealous of?

It's not what I have,
it's how many people I'm having it with.

(DOOR OPENS)

Come on, Sheldon.
We'll watch <i>Game of Thrones</i> over here.

- Gladly.
- Good, go.

You know, it'll be nice to watch
an episode without someone saying,

"I read the books,
don't get too fond of this character."

It's not always because they die.

In one case,
it's because they've become involved

with underground tree people
from the dawn of time.

Yeah, but I won't say who it is.

It's Bran.

What is going on?

Leonard's being a jerk,
so we're gonna watch over here.

Do you guys want to watch with us?

As long as I don't have to watch with him.

Fine.
I don't want to watch with you, either.

I'll go over here.

Why do you get to pick?

Okay, then you go there!

Don't tell me where to go!

Howard, just come in here.

Yeah, come on, Raj.

- Wait, did Amy make a spinach dip?
- She did.

And I'm gonna eat it all!

(DOOR CLOSES)

So what the hell happened?

Oh, I just ran out of patience
with Sheldon's nonsense.

Tell me about it.
I've had it with Raj, too.

You know, like women,
men have a monthly hormone cycle.

Dips in testosterone
can cause irritability.

Interesting.

Well, maybe my male cycle
synced up with Raj's actual period.

If Sheldon's testosterone dipped,
he'd become a butterfly.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Oh...

Maybe someone's here to apologize.

Hey, Leonard.

Stuart.

Uh...

This not a dress up party?

No.

Was it ever a dress up party?

No.

Howard, didn't you tell me
it was a dress up party?

Yep. (CHUCKLES)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

I was told this is where to go
if I'm mad at Howard?

May I take your cloak?

Thanks.

This thing kept getting caught
in the chain of my bike.

Well, I'll catch you up.

Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard.
Leonard's angry at me and Penny.

I'm angry at Leonard and Amy.

Raj is angry at Howard.

And I'm angry at George R.R. Martin

'cause there are no new books for me
to spoil it for Leonard.

So, what happened with you and Howard?

He says I was talking too much
about dating Claire and Emily,

and I accused him of being jealous.

I'm jealous.

Closest I've come to dating two women
was that time I dated one woman.

I don't know how you put up with it.

He's impossible.

I mean, holding a meeting to decide
what breakfast cereal we should buy.

Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries.
Move on.

Anyway, Amy,
thank you for sticking up for me.

Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.

Sorry?

Well, I just took your side
'cause sometimes I get annoyed

at how close Sheldon and Penny are.

They argue all the time.
They aren't that close.

Who's always comforting him
when he's upset?

Penny, but--

Who's the only one who can make him
take his medicine when he's sick?

I try to hide it in his peanut butter,
but he spits it out.

Okay, and did you know she has him
add things to the Roommate Agreement,

so she can get her way,
and not fight with you about it?

Son of a bitch.

(LAUGHING)

Why is that funny?

I don't know. I like the pain of others.

Oh, well, then, you'll enjoy this.

Bernadette does the same thing
with you and Koothrappali.

No, she doesn't.

She defends him all the time.

She does not.

Who told you to stop making
all those Gandhi jokes about him?

Well, she did, and Human Resources.

Who do you think told Koothrappali
to go to Human Resources?

Son of a bitch.

(LAUGHING)

You're right. It feels good.

All right, it's almost game time.

Get it? <i>Game of Thrones,</i> game time?

Two women, huh?

<i>(GAME OF THRONES</i> THEME PLAYING)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.

What's up?

You know, you don't need to use Sheldon

to get your way with me
in a dumb Roommate Agreement.

- Where did you get that from?
- From Amy.

Oh, Amy, why did you tell him that?

Because you were defending Sheldon
like you always do.

- I don't always defend Sheldon.
- Oh, yes, you do.

You know you have a weird brother-sister,
Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.

What about your
weird relationship with him?

That's different.

I'm like the little girl in <i>Poltergeist</i>
and he's the creepy thing in the TV.

HOWARD: <i>Um, guys,
were there any nuts in that food?</i>

I don't think so, why?

Well, just a feeling. (CHUCKLES)

Oh...

It just said "Italian sub."

I had no idea mortadella
has pistachios in it.

Interesting fact.

In Italian, the "morta" in "mortadella",
means death.

Sheldon.

I didn't say "fun fact".
I'm not a monster.

He's gonna be okay.

- (ALL SIGH)
- Now it's a fun fact.

Boy, stuff like this
really puts things in perspective.

Why are you dressed like that?

Oh, uh...

Howard thought it'd be funny
to tell me it was a costume party.

That wasn't nice.

No, but he almost died. So we're cool.

You know, if you think about it,

tonight was kind of like
a real-life <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

How?

Well, Howard eating that pistachio,
was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.

Okay, well, that was murder.
This was an accident.

Okay.

But you using Sheldon
to do your dirty work,

is like when Cersei
used the Kingsguard to do her bidding.

Cersei uses her body to manipulate men.

Penny just takes me to the Lego store.

Okay. Oh, how about this.

Stuart's dressed like a brother of the
Night's Watch, and they don't have sex.

- There you go.
- That's true.

- Makes sense.
- Fair enough.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- You all right?
- I'm fine.

Just a little embarrassed I had to be
carried down the stairs like a baby.

Thanks.

Let's get out of here.

That was scary.

Well, the important thing is,

I said that big sandwich
would ruin everything,

and I was right.

RAJ: <i>Hey, Jon Snow!</i>

How come your horse has a basket on it?

How come your head has your face on it?

They don't wear bicycle helmets
in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

You're thematically inaccurate,
but I applaud your commitment to safety.

Don't you guys have anything better to do?

Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak
ride a girl's bike?

- Nope.
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

That's it!

You just lost bathroom privileges
at the comic book store.

Horse has a basket on its stupid...

(SCREAMS)

- (BIKE CLATTERS)
- (GRUNTS)

- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- SHELDON: <i>Leonard.</i>

<i>Leonard.</i>

<i>Leonard.</i>

What?

<i>I never got to ask my question
about Batman.</i>

What is it?

<i>If Batman were bitten by a radioactive
Man-Bat,</i>

<i>and then fought crime
disguised as Man-Bat,</i>

<i>would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man</i>

<i>or, simply, Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?</i>

Is he still wearing the Batman suit
under the Man-Bat suit?

<i>I'll be back.</i>

English - SDH

Oh, hey, if you guys are free
this weekend,

I won a night of wine tasting from work.

- That sounds fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

Like, how come scientists
don't win free stuff like sales people do?

'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.
(CHUCKLES) We're in it for the groupies.

Personally, I find the notion
of external rewards demeaning.

I pursue science
for the intrinsic joy of discovery.

But you always say
that you wanna win a Nobel Prize.

I also say, "Don't contradict me
in front of my friends,"

but that you don't remember.

All right. Well, let me know
if you guys wanna go.

I would love to.

I do enjoy the complexity
of an aged Pinot Noir.

I'm sure that would pair nicely
with your five nuggets of chicken.

Well, it sounds like a nice night.
We should go.

Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you.

I like my grapes the old-fashioned way,
in a juice box.

Well, I'm going.

You couldn't stop me
from getting a massage at the mall,

and you're not stopping me now.

I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend
get groped in public by another man.

And I shouldn't have to see

my boyfriend riding on a train
for children, around the mall.

The little choo-choo for toddlers?

And now you know why I needed the massage.

Well, we're out.

Bernie can't drink, 'cause she's pregnant.

And she's pregnant because we had sex,
and we had sex because, well... (CHUCKLES)

Come on.

It's okay, you should go.

- You sure?
- Of course.

Yeah, give her a break from...

Well, come on.

Well, Bernadette, looks like
Saturday night, it's you and me.

Me? How? Why?

Well, it makes perfect sense.

Look, because you're an expectant mother,
you can't drink alcohol, I don't like to.

You can't have sushi, and I don't like to.

You can't go in hot tubs.

I consider them
vats of sweaty-people soup.

Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

Oh, come on. Well, roller coasters,
caffeine, runny eggs.

I've been avoiding these things
all my life.

And now, because you're pregnant,
you have to.

The difference is,
she's bringing life into the world,

and you sucked it out.

I guess we could give it a try.

Well, little lady,
you've heard of party hardy.

Get ready to party hardly.

I bet you'd like a drink right now.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Hey, you think it'd be okay
if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?

Sure, I'd like to meet her.

Oh, that's great. I've been wanting
her to meet you guys, too.

So, this seems
like the perfect opportunity.

But I won't be there.

Funny how that worked out.

Does this mean
Emily's not in the picture anymore?

No, I'm still dating her.

Okay, help me out.

How are you doing this?
Do they know about each other?

They know that we're not exclusive,
and we just don't ask too many questions.

You know what, it's like how I play
<i>Warlords of Ka'a</i> with you,

and <i>Elder Sign</i> with Frank and Alicia.

Who's Frank and Alicia?

You and I spend a lot of time together.
Can there be a little mystery between us?

Okay, everything's hooked up, we're ready.
(CHUCKLES)

I am going to record this for posterity.

All right, here goes nothing.

"Here goes nothing"?

This is the initial test
for our prototype.

- Can we give it a little more gravitas?
- Fine.

<i>Preliminary trial</i>

<i>of the infinite persistence
gyroscopic navigational system,</i>

<i>phase one, commencing.</i>

Uh... Maybe it's your voice.

I'm gonna see if I can get
James Earl Jones to do it in post.

(WHIRRING)

(CHUCKLES)

(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

Ah...

It's... It's beautiful.

Actually, it's making me dizzy.

Good, it's not just me. (CHUCKLES)

- CLAIRE: <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Claire.

- Hey, what's up?
- Hi, yeah, um, I was wondering

if you're free Saturday night. (CHUCKLES)

All my friends
are going to a wine tasting.

Sure.

I guess. If you don't think
meeting your friends is too big a step.

Why would it be too big a step?

I don't know,
I just don't want things to get weird.

Nothing to worry about.

People meet people all the time,
and it isn't weird.

I met Bon Jovi once,

which you'd think might be weird.
Turns out, total sweetheart.

Okay, but you and I
have been keeping things casual.

Will you introduce me as your friend
or as your girlfriend?

What if I like them
and they don't like me?

What if they like me
and I don't like them?

Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi.

I said, "You rock!"
He said, "Thanks, man." And that was that.

(SCRATCHES AND SNIFFS)

- Hey, you ready to go?
- Hang on.

What are you doing?

Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book
about wine tasting.

It teaches
the different flavor notes to look for.

- You actually smell the wine?
- I mostly just smell my nasal spray.

- Are your sinuses acting up?
- Since my preschool got a bunny.

Hey, are you still hanging out
with Bernadette tonight?

Yes, and we're going to prove that
we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.

Oh, good for you.

Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese,
processed meats and Jacuzzis,

which can all be harmful
to an unborn baby.

No honey-baked ham in a hot tub, got it.

No, and no bubble baths either.

They can increase the risk
of a urinary tract infection--

- Okay, have fun.
- Yeah.

Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel,
shark or tilefish,

which are all high in mercury.

We're leaving now!

And no contact with guinea pigs
or hamsters or their droppings.

No cat litter boxes, no paint fumes--

Okay, we're leaving. Love you, bye!

Boy, do I love restrictions.

- (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
- Hey. (CHUCKLES) Where is everybody?

Oh, we're the first ones here.

Oh.

Cool.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Cool.

(SIGHS)

Now, I don't remember the last time
it was just you and me hanging out.

Oh, I do, it was three years ago.

Oh, yeah, then we said
we should do it more often.

(CHUCKLES) And... And then, here we are.

(SIGHS)

So, Sheldon and Bernadette
are hanging out.

I know. What are they gonna talk about?

(BOTH LAUGH)

I don't know.

I really don't know.

Hey.

- Oh, good!
- Oh, thank God!

You guys been here long?

- No, two minutes.
- But, yes.

Where's Claire?

Oh, she's meeting us here.

Hey guys, do me a favor, and don't ask
too many questions about the relationship.

We're just keeping it casual.

Oh, so, I shouldn't ask her how she feels
about being a member of your harem?

Yeah, I know you're teasing,
but watch out for karma.

Hey, Penny,
isn't that your old boyfriend, Zack?

Oh, yeah.

- Are you gonna say hi to him?
- Uh, I don't know.

Hey, while you decide,
who's better in bed?

Big, hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard?

Neener-neener.

- I brought sparkling cider.
- Oh...

The bubbles tickle my nose.

I'll just open this now, so it can get
nice and flat before we drink it.

So, what do you wanna do tonight?

Oh, I have quite the evening planned.

Yeah, our fetus-friendly
festival of fun begins,

with an in-depth look
at the world of model trains.

And then, we'll kick things up a notch,

and explore all the different ways
that you can make toast.

There's more than one?

- You've heard of French toast?
- Yeah.

- And cinnamon toast?
- Yeah.

- Melba toast?
- Yeah.

You get where I'm going here?

Yeah.

I'm getting an earthy note.

Yeah. There's definitely some oak.

Also, uh, cherries?

I smell nothing.

Really? Nothing?

It's just a whole lot of Afrin.

Penny?

Oh, Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack?

- Yeah. Hey, buddy.
- Hello.

Hey, did you two get married?

- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- We did.

To each other?

Yes.

Cool. 'Cause other than
when you broke up with him and dated me,

then broke up with me,
and then dated me one more time

before going back to him,

I was always rooting for you two.

Thanks.

So, how's the science world?
What're you guys up to?

We've actually been working on a prototype
for a navigation system we invented.

But we won't bore you with the details.

Are you kidding? I love science.

Einstein, Stephen Hawking,
Mike deGrasse Tyson.

Mike deGrasse Tyson?

Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew
a mustache and became a scientist.

So, what's your invention?

Well, we're using quantum vortices
to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.

And what's neat is that they can
maintain angular momentum indefinitely.

Angular momentum.
I was wondering about that.

You could put it in a satellite
or a rocket, and it'll run forever.

Cool.

Could it be used
for missiles and war stuff?

Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.

And I doubt the military would be
interested in our little guidance system.

Is it better than the one they use now?

- A lot!
- Way better!

Huh.

You sure you guys are smart?

H-O gauge trains are 1:87th scale.

N gauge are 1:160th scale.

And that brings us to Z gauge at a

"You could easily swallow it,
don't ask how I know," 1:220.

I'm sorry, I have to ask.

When I was five,
I ingested a Z gauge locomotive.

I spent the next three days saying,

"I think I can pass it, I think
I can pass it, I think I can pass it."

What is it about trains
that you like so much?

(SIGHS) Interesting question.

When I was a child,
life was confusing and chaotic for me,

and trains represented order.

I could line them up,
categorize them, control them.

I guess you could say

that they gave me
a sense of calm in a world that didn't.

- That's lovely, Sheldon.
- Yeah.

Other than when they're
chugging through your bowels,

these things are magic.

I have to admit, I've been worried

about the military applications
since we started talking about this.

Me, too.

Why didn't you say something?

Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer,
it's not a pleasant topic.

Hey, you can't let this stop you.

Almost any scientific advancement
can be used for destructive purposes.

That's true.
Even Einstein's theory of relativity

was later applied
to the development of nuclear weapons.

E equals MC squared.

Yeah, "E" is energy, "M" for mass
and "C" for the speed of light.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

How do you know that?

Oh, Leonard mumbles it
when he wants sex to last longer.

Hey, Raj.

Hey, Claire. Good, you're here.

Guys, this is my friend, Claire.

We're casually dating, and there's no need
for any further questions about it.

- Would you like a glass of wine?
- I said no questions.

SHELDON: And last but not least,

this is one
that I like to call <i>Star Wars</i> Toast

because it has a light side
and a dark side.

All righty,
it's time for <i>Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

<i>Dungeons and Dragons,</i>
(SIGHS) that sounds about right.

You're going to enjoy this,
I designed it especially for you.

Okay, but just for a little bit.

Oh, I have a feeling that once you start,

you're not gonna want to,
or be allowed to, stop.

All right.

- Ready?
- You bet.

Your name is Bernatrix.

You are a warrior queen.
You're strong, beautiful, and tall.

Ooh, I like the idea of being tall.

I think you're gonna like a lot of things
I have in store.

For example, in this world,
only the men get pregnant.

So, your husband is home
trying not to pee when he laughs.

This is getting fun. What's next?

You're parched and weary from battle.

You stand in front of a tavern

that serves the coldest,
most delicious ale in all the realm.

Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.

What do you do?

I storm in, slam my sword down, and say,

"Barkeep, bring me
the strongest ale you have

"and serve it in the skull of a goblin!"

He wants to see ID.

So, Claire, we've heard
so many wonderful things about you.

Really? Like what?

Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.

Boy, you get some dirty looks over there
when you ask for ice.

Zack, this is my friend, Claire.

You're hot. You seeing anybody?

- She's seeing me.
- Why'd you say she's your friend?

We're just keeping it casual.

Why is he being casual with you?
You seem great.

I don't know. Ask him.

Why are you being casual with her?
She seems great.

Maybe we should take a step back.

Take a step back?
I'm not a young man anymore.

No, I mean re-evaluate what we're doing
with the guidance system.

But (SCOFFS) I got a baby on the way.
I gotta make some money.

What good is money gonna do if we
inadvertently bring about Armageddon?

Okay, let me stop you right there.

We absolutely know our invention
will not be used to destroy the world.

How?

Because no one from the future
has come back to kill us.

- (SIGHS) Very funny.
- You got something better?

- No, not really.
- Okay, then.

(TOILET FLUSHES)

How much wine did you drink?

Not a lot, I just couldn't start
until you walked away.

The Hell Prawn
lunges out of the hot spring.

(DICE CLATTERS)

You block it with your shield.
Do you attack?

Does it have eyes?

Yeah, three giant red ones,
and they never blink. It's unsettling.

I stab it in the middle eye.

(DICE CLATTERS)

Good choice! Critical hit!

Your sword goes through its eye,
into its tiny brain.

With its final dying gasp, it says,

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
"You have reduced me to a pile of sushi.

"Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce.

"It's low sodium. Ah..."

Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.

Using your sword,
you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner.

You slip into the hot spring, and enjoy
the warm water on your aching joints.

As you happily close your eyes, you recall
the incredible evening you've had,

and notice that your (DICE CLATTERS)

feet and ankles
are smaller than they've ever been.

The end.

Oh. This night turned out to be
so much more fun than I thought.

Ooh, the fun doesn't stop.

You're still going home
with a goodie bag full of toast.

Thank you for this.

You know, ever since people found out
I'm having a baby,

I feel like I became
"Pregnant Bernadette."

It was nice
to take a little break tonight.

I can understand that.

From the moment
people realized I was a genius,

I've been "Sheldon the Genius."

Although I've never really
wanted a break from that,

so I suppose I don't understand.

Which is ironic 'cause, you know, genius.
(CHUCKLES)

- Well, thanks again.
- You're welcome.

And any time you need a break
from being "Bernadette the Pregnant,"

"Bernatrix the Warrior Queen"
is here waiting.

I might just take you up on that.

Well, now mind you, that offer's only good
until the third trimester.

I can't risk getting amniotic fluid
on my spot.

Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.

What're you talkin' about?

Oh, I mean, come on, look at you.

You're classically handsome,
you've got a swimmer's body.

Next to you, I look like me.

Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that.

But I do appreciate you recognizing
my swimmer's body.

Which, incidentally, I got from playing
Marco Polo at the YMCA.

Yeah, okay.

Just do me a favor, and stop
talking about how great Claire is.

Anything for you,
my little foreign friend.

So I gotta ask,
does Raj bring around other girls?

Uh, you know,
I'm not really around that much.

- Amy knows much more than I do.
- (SPUTTERS)

I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.

Yeah, I mean, he still has an AOL address.

I see what you're sayin'.

She's not so great.

Don't listen to him.
He says crazy things all the time.

- Watch. Marco.
- Polo.

So, uh, what are you guys talking about?

Your friends were just telling me
about all the other girls you're dating.

Why would you do that?
I specifically asked you not to do that.

- We didn't.
- You just did.

Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.

- Morning.
- Morning.

Ugh. Too much wine.

Oh, I overdid it myself last night.
Hair of the dog.

Hey, did you ever think about

the military applications
for the guidance system?

Of course.

Does it bother you?

No. It did at first.

But then I talked it through
with Frank and Alicia,

and they really helped
put things into perspective.

Who are these people?

Leonard.

Friends are like toilet paper.

It's good to have extras under the sink.

English - SDH

- Helium.
- Yes.

- Taylor Swift.
- Yes.

- Pi.
- Yes.

- Kardashian.
- More specific.

- KhloÃ©? Ah!
- Yes!

See, I remember because
if it looks like Kim, it's Kim,

if it looks kind of like Kim,
it's Kourtney,

if it looks nothing like Kim, it's KhloÃ©.

Oh, that's a Venn diagram,

and I remember
because I thought to myself,

"Venn is he gonna stop talking
about this diagram?"

What're you guys doing?

Well, we decided to use our breakfast time

to expand our respective knowledge bases.

Let me try.

Atom of hydrogen,
Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.

I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?

(LAUGHS)

Oh, hey, Penny, do you wanna go
to the airport with me later

to pick up my mother?

- Sure.
- LEONARD: <i>Thanks.</i>

No problem.

Hey, Penny, since you're already
gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?

Why don't you wanna
get your mother from the airport?

I can do without the 40-minute car ride

where she criticizes
every aspect of my life.

She can cover it in a car ride?

I can do 40 minutes on your posture alone.

You really want me
to pick up your mother all by myself?

I just feel like it would be
a good chance for you to bond.

Or a way for you to avoid her?

I don't know what he's putting on those
cards, but you are smarter than ever.

Fine, if you really want me to,
I will pick your mom up.

Seriously?

Yeah, you know what,
she is my mother-in-law,

and I'd like for us to have
a good relationship.

That is very mature of you,
so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah!

- All right, back to learning.
- Okay.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Oh, easy, Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

Or as I know him.

Creepy old dude
from <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

(IMITATING BELL DINGING)

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Did you guys see
there's an <i>Avengers</i> screening?

Joss Whedon's gonna show
some deleted scenes

and do a question and answer session.

Well, I have a few questions for him
about the last <i>Avengers</i> movie,

and a whole lot of answers.

When's the screening?

It's tonight,
but it's first come, first served,

so we should probably
get there early and wait in line.

Let's do it.

Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.

Bad news, Amy's making me
go shopping with her later,

so it looks like none of us can go.

You do realize we're allowed
to have fun without you?

In fact, that's usually the trick to it.

What time do we need to get there?

Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

You're really going without me?

It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy,
and we'll save a spot in line for you.

You don't have the authority
to save places in the line.

If I do that, I'll be cutting.

People do it all the time.

You know the golden rule
of line etiquette,

"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."

If you really care that much,

there are apps now
that'll let you hire people to do stuff

like errands and wait in lines.

People are actually
waiting in lines as a job?

Boy, it makes me feel better
about my life.

Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.

And now I feel worse again.

I'm not surprised Leonard chose
to avoid picking me up.

He's battled intimacy issues
his whole life.

Does he have difficulty
maintaining erections?

(CLEARING THROAT) Wow. Didn't even
make it out of the parking lot.

You know what, enough about Leonard,
let's talk about you.

What would you like to do
while you're here?

Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

You don't have to avoid having
intimate conversations with me.

Well, I'd actually like
for us to be close,

but maybe we start with our favorite books

and work our way up
to my husband's sex organs.

Very well. What's the last book you read?

Uh, does <i>Pottery Barn Spring</i> count?

Penny, it's only natural to want
your mother-in-law to like you,

and I acknowledge
I can be an intimidating person.

So, what can I do
to make this process easier for you?

For starters, maybe you can
not psychoanalyze everything I say?

And how does it make you feel when
I psychoanalyze everything you say?

Uncomfortable.

That was a joke, dear.

Oh, sorry.

(CHUCKLES) Didn't know you made those.

Hey, listen, what if we have

a little mother-in-law,
daughter-in-law dinner tonight?

So, just the two of us?

Or do I invite a few girlfriends?

'Cause hearing you say "the two of us"
just sent a chill right down my spine.

Hey.

What are you doing here?
You're not Sheldon.

I thought that might come up.

Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.

Hold on, he paid you
to get out of spending time with me?

No, it's not like that.

There's a long line he'd rather stand in.

So, what're we doing, Old Navy,
Build-A-Bear, I get paid either way.

We're not going shopping together.

You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag,

and Sheldon gave me money
for Hot Dog on a Stick.

Can you understand
why I might be annoyed right now?

(CHUCKLING) Look, lady, I just work here.

We've waited in a lot of lines together,
haven't we?

Remember when we camped out
for the <i>Doctor Who</i> panel at Comic-Con?

Yeah, sleeping under the stars

with other fans who love the show
as much as we do.

Waking up wondering
which of those fans stole our wallets.

Stuart, what're you doing here?

Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate
person I have ever met in my entire life!

Where do you get off
sending me to shop with your girlfriend?

I don't understand. You were happy
to do this when I hired you.

Why are you upset with me now?

I'm not upset with you,
but Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

so she hired me to let you have it.

Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.

You're darn right it's fair play,
you selfish jerk!

You know, just when I think we're
making progress in our relationship,

we revert to our old patterns where
thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.

I mean, if he didn't wanna go shopping
with me, why didn't he just say so?

Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.

Sorry, I've been going on and on.

No, it's all right, dear.

Sheldon has a brilliant
and complicated mind.

It's understandable that being in
a relationship with him could be trying.

I called him "babe" once.
He asked me to get a drug test.

Well, I do admire your resolve.
You're an extraordinary woman.

Thank you.

You know what, she's my mother-in-law,
why can't I bond with her like that?

Amy's with Sheldon
who she loves like a son.

You're with her son, who she doesn't.

Do you realize it took me five years
to get a massage from him?

Well, that still could be
a big step for Sheldon.

Three minutes.
And he used a kitchen timer.

I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

You know, being in a relationship
with Leonard

also comes with its challenges.

Yes, well, what can you do?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Maybe it's Sheldon,
here to say he's sorry.

Sheldon says he's sorry.

Bernadette,
I'll give you $5 to slam the door.

I would've done it for $3.

Boy, all this standing's making me tired.

Good thing I brought
my collapsible stick chair.

The stick chair.
You look like an idiot on that thing.

Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but chairs on sticks are comfy.

Hey.

Hey, is everything smoothed out with Amy?

Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

Did you make the apology
as sincere as I would have?

I said, "Sheldon says he's sorry."

Yeah, well,
that's laying it on a little thick.

Think it's time
you apologize to her yourself.

I suppose so, but if I get out of line,
I'll lose my spot.

I'm happy to hold your place
till you get back.

You would do that?

Consider it my way
of getting more of your money.

You're a good man.

So, Beverly, did you know
Penny is the number three sales rep

at our pharmaceutical company?

I didn't realize you two work together.

Well, we don't exactly, I'm
a microbiologist for the research team.

What are you currently developing?

BERNADETTE: <i>Some exciting
new anti-anxiety drugs.</i>

That's interesting. I just attended
a lecture on pediatric anxiety.

Oh, was it Dr. Jenofski?
I just saw his TED Talk.

BEVERLY: <i>It was.</i>

Well, let's get back to Penny.

Hey, weren't you telling me something
great about your company car?

Um... (CLEARING THROAT)

It has seat warmers.

(INTERMITTENT KNOCKING ON DOOR)

SHELDON: <i>Amy, Amy, Amy.</i>

Come in.

Hello, everyone.
Oh, Beverly, good to see you.

I'd love to chat, but there's a line
that could start moving any minute,

so let's do this.

Amy, a proper apology
requires three steps.

Step one, an admission of wrongdoing.
Amy, I was wrong.

Step two, a promise
never to repeat said action.

Amy, that action will never be repeated,
and that's a promise.

Step three,
an earnest request for forgiveness.

Amy, I hope you can forgive me,
and I hope you do it right now

'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs,

and I don't wanna repeat this apology
nonsense with my driver, Ganesh.

Fine.

Oh, thanks, you're a peach.

And Beverly, we'll catch up soon.

Bernadette, it's a pleasure, as always.
Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.

How long have I had spinach in my teeth?

Since the airport, dear.

You look like you come with a kickstand.

You can't make me feel bad.

Maybe not. Leonard?

So, when the aliens brought you back,
they just left the probe in?

- I'm back.
- Hey, how'd it go?

It went well.

You know, I've learned that
if you never say you're sorry,

the times you do
really puts them on their heels.

Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.

Anyone else need anything before I go?

I'll give you a dollar
if you make fun of Raj.

- That's mean.
- Five.

You look like Tigger
if Tigger looked like a jackass.

If you ever need a reference
or anything, just let me know.

Hey, guys.

Did you see that?

He just cut the line.

He's just joining his friends, it's fine.

No, it's not fine.
It is a breach of line etiquette.

We're near the front of the line.
We'll get in either way.

What if every person in front of us
lets someone cut?

We'd still get in.

What if each of those people
let someone cut?

Still get in.

Then each of those people let someone cut?

We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you
over the head with his stick chair.

- Excuse me.
- Oh, please don't.

I couldn't help but notice
that you cut the line.

Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.

No, it's not cool.

If there were reserved seating,
we all had tickets, that'd be fine,

but this line is first-come, first-served.

Not "show up tardy
and nevertheless be first-served."

- Right here.
- No.

You need to go to the back of the line.

(SCOFFS) Who made you line monitor?

Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

And my slogan was, "A line
this straight is a line that's great."

Is this guy for real?

Boy, I wish I could say no.

That was very nice of Sheldon
to apologize.

Well, he's come a long way,

or a short way very slowly,
so it feels like a long way.

Your relationship with him is fascinating.

<i>I'm preparing to write a book
on high-achieving couples,</i>

and I would love to interview
the both of you.

Oh, sure, I'll talk to Sheldon about it.

You know, Bernadette's husband's
a former astronaut.

Really?

Do you think he would be interested
in being interviewed as well?

Do I think he'd be interested?

Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed

when he's alone in the bathroom.

Wonderful, I'll give you
my contact information.

Um, you should
probably talk to Penny, too.

About what?

Okay, you know what, this is ridiculous.

I've been trying to make
a connection with you all day,

and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

Well, are you seeking a connection
or just some form of validation?

What I was seeking was
some sort of friendship,

but at this point I'll take you
not insulting me to my face.

My intention was never to insult you.

You've been doing it all day.
Do you even know what an insult is?

Well, it's not a clinical term,

but one example would be
your marrying my son and not inviting me

or even telling me
the wedding was taking place.

Okay, good example.

What about Joss Whedon's work
makes you think he'd be okay

with rule-breakers and line-cutters?

The Avengers are rule-breakers, being
vengeful is in their job description.

They work for S.H.I.E.L.D.,

which is a sanctioned department
of the U.S. government.

Now, do you work for a sanctioned
department of the U.S. government?

As a matter of fact I do,

at a little place called the DMV.

He's got him there.
The "D" even stands for department.

Excuse me,
can I please see a show of hands?

Who here takes issue
with this person cutting the line?

Told you.

Well, what a sad state of affairs.

Now that you've all been
so ground down by life,

you don't even notice
when someone disrespects you.

I can't believe we're gonna get beat up,
and it's not because of your chair.

SHELDON: <i>It's time for you to wake up.</i>

You know, right now,
at the back of this line,

there's a movie fan like you
who's not going to get in

because this person simply doesn't care.

Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

<i>there was another person
at the back of the line,</i>

and her name was Rosa Parks.

Okay, you may have to pretend you're black
to get us out of here.

Let's all follow in that brave woman's
footsteps and stand up for ourselves.

Now, and I realize that
she stood up by remaining seated,

but now is not the time
to enjoy the irony of that.

Now, I ask you again,
who here takes issue with this person--

Why should we listen to you?
You cut the line yourself.

I most certainly did not.

I saw you.

If you're feeling dizzy,
it's because the tables have turned.

Excuse me, I paid someone
to wait in line for me,

and then when I arrived, he left.

So what you saw, my good woman,
was swapsies, not cutsies.

No, no, no, no, no, wait.

I ask you again, show of hands,
who here takes issue with--

Stop moving! He's gonna get in!

- Buddy, let it go.
- No, I can't, this isn't right.

- You did everything you could.
- No, I could've done more.

Now, now.

You denigrated the memory
of a great civil rights pioneer.

That's all anyone could ask.

To be honest, I'm surprised
you cared about the wedding at all.

I'm still human, Penny.

Not getting invited to my own
son's wedding is difficult to ignore.

I know how you feel.
She didn't invite any of us.

It was spur of the moment.

Well, we did get to see
a live stream of it on the Internet.

I could've watched it on the Internet?

(WHISPERING) Thank you.

So, if we would've asked you
to come to Vegas to see us get married,

you would've come?

No, I would've said
you're making a huge mistake,

but an invitation would've been nice.

You really think we made a mistake?

At the time I did,
but I've never seen Leonard so happy,

so perhaps I was wrong.

Wow.

Okay, well, how about this?

Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard
and I can have another small ceremony,

you know, if you're interested.

I would find that perfectly acceptable.

(GASPS)

She would find it perfectly acceptable.
You guys saw it, we bonded.

Howie, you're doin' okay?
You've been in there a while.

HOWARD: <i>I'm fine, be right out.</i>

<i>Am I an American hero?</i> (SCOFFS)

<i>Oh...</i>

<i>That's a good question, Jim.</i>

<i>You know, don't you think
once an astronaut leaves the planet,</i>

<i>he's a hero
to all the nations of the Earth?</i>

(TOILET FLUSHING)

<i>Okie-dokie, I think I have time
for one more question.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

- Hey.
- Hi, how was the screening?

Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

to make somebody, who cut the line,
feel bad,

but only the white people felt bad.

I should have never
bought him that coloring book

that explains Black History Month.

How'd it go with my mother?

You know, it started a little rocky,
but I think we got to a good place.

Wow. Well done. (CHUCKLES)

Yeah, and when I dropped her off
at the hotel,

she even gave me a hug.

Did she think you were choking?

I'm sorry, that's great.
Thank you for spending time with her.

No problem.

So, listen, I don't know
if you have any plans next weekend,

but I kind of promised your mom
we'd have another wedding ceremony

so she could attend this time.

Wait, we're gonna get married again?

Yeah, kind of, but now
we can invite our friends and family.

Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.

Come on, it'll be fun. And you know,
your mom was genuinely hurt

we didn't invite her to the first one.

Well, in our defense,
it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

And also, we don't like her.

Leonard, come on, she's your mom.

If we can do something to make her happy,
why wouldn't we?

I just said why. We don't like her.

Okay, look, forget about her,
let's do it for us.

We can keep it small and informal,
and this time we can invite our families.

Is your brother out of prison?

Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

I'd love it if my dad could come.

Oh! You have to invite him.
I haven't seen him since the divorce.

Oh, he is like a different man.

He stopped twitching,
and I think he grew an inch and a half.

Well, then it's settled.

Yay!

God, it's so funny, I never thought
my second marriage would be to you.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, so, it's not a legal ceremony,

it's just a chance for us
to redo our vows

so everyone can be part of it.

So, there's no maid of honor?

- No.
- Hmm.

But if I were to, say,
wear a purple satin dress

with a sweetheart neckline
and stand near you,

you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?

- I don't see how I could.
- (LAUGHS)

Then I graciously accept. (CHUCKLES)

Who's going to officiate?

I was kind of hoping you would.

Wait, now I'm just
some lousy maid of honor? What?

Hey, good news. I just got off the phone
with my mother.

She is coming to the wedding.

Okay, you're inviting people
to <i>our</i> wedding?

Yes, I'm inviting people to <i>our</i> wedding.

Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking
and Robert Downey, Jr.,

and now, don't get your hopes up,
'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.

Who's Erno Rubik?

Seriously?

He invented the Rubik's Cube.

Okay, fine, but why would you invite him
to our wedding?

Because despite his fame and fortune,
he strikes me as a lonely man.

Well, it's very sweet of you
to go to all this trouble

for Leonard's mother.

You know, I'm also doing it for Leonard.

I think
this could really help their relationship.

How dare you invite your father
without consulting me?

I'm sorry,
but I don't think I need your permission

to have my father at my wedding.

You do understand our marriage ended
because he had an affair.

I know, and there's no excuse for that.

He claimed I was cold, emasculating,

and hadn't shown him
any physical affection for years.

I was wrong,
there's three excuses for that.

Oh, my God, it's working.

- You sure?
- Look.

The system is maintaining
its own stability.

The quantum vortex apparatus
is now controlling the orientation.

You're right. You realize what this means?

Yeah.

I do.

It's proof of concept.

We've got a workable guidance system.

Congratulations. (CHUCKLES)

- Thanks.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

(BEEPS)

Hey, I just got an email
from the US Air Force.

Open it.

"We request a meeting
at your earliest convenience

"regarding your quantum guidance system,
provisional patent 62/295118."

That's weird.

Is there a window around here
we don't know about?

No, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

Yeah, of course, what else could it be?

Boy, do I love America!

Thank you for picking me up.

Oh, you're welcome.

I was speaking to your young lady.

My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

Oh, please, call me Mary.

Okay, Mary.

You know, that doesn't work for me,
let's stay with "Mrs. Cooper."

Sheldon, don't be silly.

What? That's what I called you
until I got to know you better.

It was so nice of Leonard and Penny
to invite me.

- Well, actually--
- It sure was!

I've always had a special place
in my heart for Leonard,

taking care of my baby all these years.

Excuse me, I take care of him.

Sure you do.

So, who else is coming to this shindig?

Oh, well, the usual gang.
Penny's family's coming tomorrow.

Yeah, Leonard's mother's already here.

Oh, Beverly, how nice.

You've met her, right?

Yes, I have.

Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.

Either way,
let's stop and get some garlic.

So, Mary, how have you been?

Thank you so much for asking.
I've been well, and you?

- Very good.
- Good.

I don't know what we were worried about,
they're getting along great.

Sheldon tells me your husband's coming.

My ex-husband.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

- Don't be.
- All right.

Ooh. Chilly.

I think I can see my breath.

We can hear you.

- Sorry.
- Sorry.

I can't believe I was so naÃ¯ve.

The military is just gonna take over
the whole project.

And you know what happens if we object.

We disappear.

(HOWARD CHUCKLES)

Like, off the map!

Like every American Idol winner
since season four.

Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.

(YELLS) Am I?
(WHISPERS) Am I?

I mean, what do you wanna bet

some black-ops guy
is reprinting my high school yearbook,

and I'm no longer in it.

That chess club picture is now just
David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.

Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force website,

and the department that emailed you
is in charge of acquisitions.

So, maybe they just wanna give you
a lot of money for your invention.

Oh, please, that's not how it works.

You saw <i>E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World.</i>
The military just shows up and takes over.

You do realize
those weren't documentaries, right?

(LAUGHS)

I'm sorry, you find this funny?

No, I was just thinking
about <i>Jurassic World.</i>

Boy, that was terrible.

Oh, we have to use the stairs.

When are they gonna fix your elevator?

I don't... Any day now.

Well, the stairs are fine.

ALFRED: Besides,
your mother's up there.

Maybe I'll have a heart attack
and not have to see her.

Hey, I know things are a little rough
with you and Mom,

but I'm really glad you're here.

Me, too.

I should never have had that angioplasty,
because I feel fine.

Penny's really looking forward
to seeing you.

Ah, she's a sweetie.

You got a good one there, Leonard.

Thanks, Dad.

How the hell did you do that?

(CRUNCHES)

(CRUNCHES)

Isn't this nice?

Hey, we're here.

- Alfred, thank you for coming!
- Oh!

- Well, happy to be here.
- Thanks.

- And congratulations.
- Thank you.

Dad, you remember Sheldon.

- Dr. Hofstadter.
- Dr. Cooper.

This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

And his girlfriend, Amy.

- A pleasure.
- Hi.

And of course, Mom.

Hello, my hateful shrew.

Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.

All right, now I'm starting to sense
a little tension.

All right, you two, don't start.

Penny and I
are throwing this second wedding

for your benefit.

Can you please not ruin it?

Of course. I'm sorry.

Look at that, you can apologize.

- Mom!
- I'm sorry.

You know, the Bible says forgiveness--

- Mom!
- I'm sorry.

Who's hungry? We have a reservation
at the best restaurant in town.

That only got
three and a half stars on Yelp.

- Sheldon.
- I'm not sorry, that's true.

I don't know what to do.
It's the Air Force.

I mean, should I respond to their email?
Ignore it?

You can't ignore it.

It's not that postcard that says
it's time to go back to the dentist.

Guys, come on,
we're meeting everyone for dinner.

One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

Dude, the minute you opened that email,
they knew you got it.

I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now.

Damn.

I love America.

Are you done with this nonsense?

It's not nonsense.
This is how the US military works.

If it's even the US military.

It could be foreign military
pretending to be American.

You're right. We turn our guidance system
over to them,

next thing we know,
they're using it against us.

I also love the enemies of America.

Penny, I hope the example
of my failed marriage to Leonard's father

doesn't discourage you from the commitment
you've made to one another.

No, of course not.

Although, Alfred and I had a lot more
going for us than you two.

Mom, please save something for the toast.

So, Alfred,
what is it that you do for a living?

Oh, I'm an anthropologist.
I study ancient peoples and cultures.

My goodness!
So, all the way back to the Flood.

(LAUGHS)

Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.

Play with your phone.

Well, on that note,
there are many cultures

that have an apocalyptic flood
as part of their mythology.

I don't have a mythology,
I have the unerring word of God.

- But that's very interesting.
- Oh!

I didn't mean to disparage your faith.
Actually, I admire it.

- Really?
- Yes.

I'm an agnostic, myself,

but I have prayed many times to God
to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.

Well, he came close. He turned her
into a giant block of ice.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Howard, there must be someone
at the university you can go to for help.

Are you kidding?

They're probably the ones who leaked it
to the military in the first place.

What about the guy on the <i>Channel 4</i> news?

You know? "Four on your side."
Maybe he can be on <i>your</i> side.

I'm being harassed by the government.

I'm not trying to get to
the bottom of a dog-walking scam.

Ugh. Stop.

You know what's really happening?

All the movies you've watched,
the TV shows, the comic books,

they've completely twisted your thinking.

No one's after you,
no one's listening to you,

no one cares about you.

I'd like to think

the "Four on your side" guy
cares about me.

You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred
have your differences.

But if you think about it,
if you hadn't married him,

- there'd be no Leonard.
- (CHUCKLES)

So, that's good, right?

Yeah.

(SIGHING)

Is that Howard in front of us?

Oh, maybe. Hey, get closer.

God, I think someone's following us.

You're being ridiculous.

I'm not being ridiculous. He's right
on my tail. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

Oh! Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

I don't know. He uses that traffic app,
maybe there's an accident.

Oh! So follow him.

Oh, no!

I told you.

It's probably just a coincidence.

Speed up a little,
see if he stays with you.

Well, go faster, you're losing him.

What is his hurry?

You know what? Flash your lights,
let him know it's you.

He's flashing his lights.
What's that mean?

I think he wants us to pull over.

Do not pull over!
I'm not raising this baby alone!

Hang on!

So, after your husband passed,
you never remarried?

No. Just focused on work and the church.

Ah! And what do you do?

I work at the church.

Well, they're lucky to have you.

Well, thank you.

You're welcome.

Do you realize what's happening here?

Yeah, I do.

They're filling up on bread
and ruining their meal.

- Hey.
- Hey, what took you guys so long?

We were following Howard,
but for some reason

he turned off his headlights
and went up a one-way street.

So, what did we miss?

Oh, just Mary and I
getting to know each other a little.

Leonard, your father's just charming.

He's also broke. Did he mention that?

Okay, Mom, you sit over there.

You know, I'm gonna call Bernadette
and see what's keeping them.

Well, if I'd known you were broke,

I wouldn't have made a big deal
about the bread.

Hey, Penny.

What are you talking about?

Oh, that was you?

(CHUCKLES)

Long story.
Why don't you go ahead and eat?

We're gonna be a while.

I'm telling ya, I'm not on drugs.
The government's out to get me!

Now, one of the more exciting things
we found recently

is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens
frequently mated with each other.

Well, that certainly explains
my marriage to Sheldon's father.

(LAUGHING)

That's funny because my father
was not a very clever man.

I'd be lost without you.

(CLINKING)

I would like to propose a toast
to my wife and bride-to-be.

- Now, see, that's funny because--
- Back to your phone.

Penny,

I've always known I loved you.

But this last year has shown me
that I also love being married to you.

Thank you for saying yes.

Thanks for asking until I did.

- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

I would also like to make a toast.

Aww.

Leonard, I am so happy
that you have found a woman

who loves and cares for you.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

Why don't you take a pill?

Like you did before sex?

What I really needed was a blindfold.

All right, everyone, calm down.

Let's all remember
what it says in the Bible,

"He who is slow to anger
is better than the mighty."

Oh, dear woman,
can you please read another book?

When God writes one, I will.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Um...

If we wanna order the soufflÃ©,
we might wanna get on that.

Leonard, if you don't mind,
I think I'm a little tired.

I'm gonna call it a night.

- Sure, Dad.
- I'm a little tuckered out myself.

I will see you all in the morning.

- Would you like to share a cab?
- That would be fine.

- Where you staying?
- I'm at the Westin.

Well, so am I.
Could I interest you in a nightcap?

I think that you could.

What is happening there?

I think it's pretty obvious.

They don't want dessert
'cause they filled up on bread.

She's still not answering.

My father's not texting me back.

'Cause they both turned their phones off.

I don't like this at all.

I don't like it, either.

Really?

(LAUGHS) Because I love it.

(LAUGHING)

English - SDH

PENNY: <i>Previously</i> on
The Big Bang Theory...

Dad, this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

- And, of course, Mom.
- Hello, my hateful shrew.

Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.

(COMPUTER CHIMES)

Hey! ljust got an email
from the US Air Force.

I'm just afraid, if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

Dude, the minute you opened that email,
they knew you got it.

I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now.

Oh, God, I think someone's following us.

Turn left here,
and see if he turns with us.

Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

I don't know, he uses that traffic app.
Maybe there's an accident.

So, follow him.

Oh, no!

Leonard, if you don't mind,
I think I'm a little tired.

-L'm gonna call it a night.
- Sure, Dad.

I'm a little tuckered out myself,
I will see you all in the morning.

- Would you like to share a cab?
- That would be fine.

- Where are you staying?
-l'm at the Westin.

Well, so am I.
Could I interest you in a nightcap?

I think that you could.

SHELDON: Leonard?

<i>Leonard?</i>

What?

<i>You realize,
you and I could become brothers.</i>

We're not gonna be brothers,
we're not gonna be stepbrothers.

Go to sleep.

I hope you're right.

'Cause a grown man living with his
brother and his brother's wife is weird.

- Go to sleep.
- Okay.

<i>Do you think your father is doing
unspeakable things to my mother?</i>

No.

Are you saying that
because the things are unspeakable?

Your parents are old, anything unspeakable
was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep!

Very well.

I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make
the ceremony awkward.

God, I thought my brother,
fresh out of jail

was gonna make everyone uncomfortable,
but now this--

<i>Hey, if you want me to sleep,
you're going to have to stop talking.</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, I'm gonna go pick up my family.

Like, an hour and half, two hours,
depending on traffic.

- Yeah, drive safe.
- Okay, and do yourself a favor, all right?

When Beverly gets here,
do not bring up last night. All right?

As far as you're concerned,
you don't know anything,

you didn't see anything,
I want you just to play dumb.

It was nice of her to show us
"playing dumb" with an example.

What? Oh!

Hi. Okay. Hey, there.
I'm sorry, I gotta go now.

- Penny, wait.
- Why?

I wanted to thank you for going through
all the trouble of planning

a second wedding ceremony for me.

But unfortunately, I cannot attend.

Why? What's wrong?

Are we still doing the dumb thing?
Okay. Why, what's wrong?

I just cannot stay here, while your father
goes out of his way to humiliate me.

Oh, golly!
However did he humiliate you?

Stop it, Sheldon.

Do I say "stop what"
or just throw in the towel?

I don't see why I should have to watch
your father parade around

with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.

Excuse me! That is my mother
you're talking about, however accurately.

Okay. Beverly,
aren't you overreacting a little?

All we know is
they shared a cab and had a nightcap.

- And turned their phones off.
- Not helping, buddy.

Mother, Penny and I really
want you to be part of this. Please stay?

Yeah, plus, if you leave,
Alfred will know he got under your skin.

Well, we can't have that.

Also, if they did have coitus, we'll
all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.

It is funny when you think about it.

Maybe to you,
you didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.

Because you were driving like a lunatic.

Hey, if thinking secret government agents
are chasing you makes you a lunatic,

then, yeah, okay.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, I'll get it.

It didn't help
that you couldn't walk a straight line

when the cop pulled you over.

I have performance anxiety.

You of all people should know that.

Hello.

I'm looking for a Howard Wolowitz.

Howard Wolowitz?

I have the right address, don't I?

Address?

Is he here?

Uh, no.

Do you know where I can find him?

- May I ask what this is about?
- No, you may not.

Very well.

- Have him call me.
- Okay.

HOWARD: Raj, who's at the door?

(CHUCKLES) That's not him.

Ah, I can't wait for you to meet everyone.
I told them all about you.

Like what?
Do they know about your brother?

Not everything, just like,
the jail and drugs part.

- Why would you do that?
- What?

The world doesn't need
to know our problems.

- Mom, I'm sorry, but I--
- Hey, look.

They got Walgreens here, too.

You really think it's helpful
to change the subject, Wyatt?

Just trying
to make this a happy trip, dear.

Well, quit it!

(CLEARS THROAT)

Oh, uh, Randall, can't believe
after all these years,

you finally get to visit me in California.

Well, good thing
I was a nonviolent offender.

Otherwise, I couldn't have left the state.

All right, that's enough jail talk.

Penny knows where I was,
she sent me cigarettes.

You sent your brother cigarettes?

He was cooking
and selling crystal meth, Susan.

I think we can let the cigarettes slide.

Stop trying to be the cool dad.

You have a shirt
with our cat's picture on it.

Anyway, we're here, slugger.

That's great! Now, they know where I live.

What are you talking about?
They've always known where you live.

Yeah, if you wanna go off the grid,

you have to move out
of your mother's house.

Can we take a moment to discuss that
I just lied to the government for you?

Yeah, I would not have done that for you.

Howard, please just call the man,
see what he wants?

All right, all right.

Hey. Make sure you tell him that
you weren't home when he came by.

And that your Indian friend
gave you the message,

the moment you stepped through the door.

Yes, hello. (CLEARS THROAT)

This is Howard Wolowitz,
for Colonel Richard Williams.

I take it back, don't mention me.

Hi, Colonel Williams. How can I help you?

What? Yes, he is from India.

No, I don't know his immigration status.

Relax, I'm still on hold!

Speaking.

Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

Caltech is fine.
Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

(CHUCKLES)

I may not?

That's what he said to me.

- Here you are, Mother.
- Thank you.

I'm glad you decided to stay.

It's gonna be special for Penny and me
to share this with you.

I can't wait for this day to be over.

Yeah, special, like that.

-(KNOCKING)
- That's them.

Please don't make things any more awkward
than they already are.

Right, so,
less or equally awkward, got it.

- Hey, guys. Come on in.
- Thank you.

- Good morning.
- Morning.

- Hello.
- How is everyone today?

- Good, and you?
- Good, good.

- Good.
-l'm good, too.

Good.

So, did you defile my mother, or not?

(ALL GASP)

Sheldon! You're being rude.

If I may, I can assure you,
your mother and I did nothing more

than share a cab and a conversation.

Did that conversation include the phrase,
"Your genitals are a joy to behold"?

That's enough!

Look, I promise you, neither I,
nor anyone has ever said that.

You don't know his girlfriend very well.

Or what a joy it is
to behold my genitals.

All right, you guys, get settled in.

Then, we'll go across the hall,
and say hi to everyone.

You know, it's hard to believe
I've never met Leonard.

Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs
from a local vendor.

(PENNY LAUGHS)

- Not funny, Wyatt.
- I thought it was really funny.

Thanks.

Well, fine. If everyone wants
to make jokes about our problems,

then, I can, too. Knock-knock.

Who's there?
Our family is an embarrassment.

That's not much of a joke.

Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous,

but I promise you, no one
is going to judge you, or this family.

I'm sorry.

It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents
for the first time.

And they're academics,

and intellectuals, and I don't
want them thinking we're white trash.

Well, what color trash
do you think they'll believe?

How could you think that I would spend
the night with a man ljust met?

A man named Jesus
convinced you to build a church in Africa.

You're kind of a sucker.

Well, nothing happened. Right?

It's over,
until we get married a third time,

you guys will never have
to see each other again.

Well, you know,
actually that's not the case.

Mary may visit me in New York.

And he's never been to Texas.

Maybe we meet halfway.

What? In the
Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?

I can't be the only one
that knows that's halfway.

You're not seriously
going to visit each other?

And why wouldn't we?

Oh, please, you're just saying this
to antagonize me.

Not at all.
Mary happens to be a wonderful woman.

And if it antagonizes you,
that's just a bonus.

Mary, I'm sorry
you're in the middle of this.

No, no. Nothing to be sorry about,
I genuinely like your father.

(STAMMERING)
But he's a mediocre academic.

And, according to Beverly,
his sexual prowess is subpar.

He's basically Leonard
with a bigger prostate.

Are you saying that my dad's
not good enough for your mom?

Yes, while also getting in a solid dig
at you, pretty efficient, huh?

I can't even... This is ridiculous.
I'm going across the hall.

Why should you get to go and leave
me here with your bickering parents?

Fine, then you go.

Well, I don't want to stay here
with her, I'll go.

<i>- I'll</i> go with you.
- That still leaves me here with him.

Hang on, hang on.

We're smart, we can figure this out.
Okay, so,

Mary and Beverly can't be together.

Alfred and Beverly can't be together.

Leonard and I can't be together.

Now, I could be with Alfred,
but I don't like his face.

Here, I've got it!

Who's ready for a wedding?

Great, now I have to start all over.

So, how's the world of pharmaceuticals
treating you?

Pretty good. I actually just
got assigned a much better territory.

See what happens when you work hard?

Hey, she just sells drugs,
I had to make them.

Okay, that's enough.

No more drug talk
for the rest of this trip.

I'll drink 110 that.

- Haven't you had enough?
- Penny drinks more than I do.

Well, I learned from the best.

- Aw!
- Aw! (CHUCKLES)

Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why
this one turned out the way he did.

See what I've got to put up with?

What you've got to put up with?
Why did you have to go to jail?

It's called getting caught, Mother!

- Hello.
- Hey, there he is!

Oh, Leonard,
it's so nice to see you again.

You, too.
Everyone, this is my mother, Beverly.

- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

We are not white trash.

Are you excited
to see your son walk down the aisle?

Yes, lam. I'm just feeling a little
guilty about all the trouble I've caused.

Oh, so am I.

You made God sad today, Mom.

Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong.
I think it's nice they're hitting it off.

That's still no reason
to rush into anything.

I mean, look at us,
we took things remarkably slow.

You and I,
we didn't even hold hands for two years.

It was a lot hotter than it sounds.

Well, you're a patient young lady.

Hey! She's mine,
take a cold shower, Grandpa.

Why wouldn't that Colonel say
what the meeting is about?

- It has to be bad news.
- Yeah, calm down.

Okay? Try not to think about it.

- That's really stupid advice.
- You know that hurts my feelings.

Calm down, try not to think about it.

Okay.

- Why do I bother talking to you?
- Oh, come on.

What's the worst
that could come of this meeting?

I don't know, they take
the invention away and I get nothing.

Okay, that's not so bad.

You know what happened to the scientists
that worked on the Manhattan Project?

The government forced them
to move to the desert.

They had to live in secret.

And when Oppenheimer objected
to what they made him do,

they destroyed his reputation.

What's the point of that story?

Just read a book about Oppenheimer,
seemed like a chance to show off.

(LAUGHS)

There he is,
there's my happy Hebraic homeboy.

Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember
when you're living in the desert,

and I'm living with your wife.

So, what do you do for a living?

Mommy, you wanna take this one?

Um, Randall's in between jobs.

(WHISPERING) And court appearances.

It's nice to meet the woman
who raised this fine young man.

I'm looking forward to meeting his father.

Prepare to be disappointed.

And he can't wait to meet you, too.
Can I get anyone a drink?

- I could use another beer.
- You're done!

He's done.

Hey! ls everyone
getting to know each other?

Not at all.

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter,
I'm Leonard's friend, Stuart.

Nice to see you, too.

Hi, I'm Stuart.

Oh, I'm Alfred. Leonard's father.

Oh! Oh, hi! I'm sorry,
did you two wanna sit together?

- No.
- No.

I was wondering why
the front row was available.

Okay, I think we're ready.

(BRIDAL MARCH PLAYING)

Why do people cry at weddings?

They're practicing
for what's coming later.

Thank you for cleaning yourself up
for your sister's wedding.

Thank you for my new teeth.

(LAUGHS)

Welcome to the family, Leonard.

Don't lend your new brother-in-law money.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

We're here today to celebrate love.

(SIGHS)

Sigh louder, no one heard you.

Really, I can move.

Not just Leonard and Penny's love,
but the love we have for them,

as well as each other.

Speaking of love, STDs among
the elderly are skyrocketing.

Love is patient,

but it's not gonna put up with all
the side chatter, so, let's knock it off!

At least she's yelling at someone else
for a change--

<i>BERNADETTE'. Howard!</i>

Okay, I understand
everyone is a little tense today,

so, lam just gonna
get to the important stuff.

Leonard,

standing here with you
in front of our family and friends is

bringing up a lot of feelings.

Like what a good idea it was
to elope the first time.

(LAUGHS)

But also,
how incredibly happy you make me.

Thank you for marrying me.
Hopefully, for the last time.

Penny,

as a scientist, my job is to figure out
why things happen.

But I don't think I'll ever understand

how someone like me
could get to be with someone like you.

You know, maybe,

I don't need to understand it, ljust
need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.

(PENNY LAUGHS)

Anybody have anything snarky
to say about that?

Didn't think so.

I'd like to say something.
(CLEARS THROAT)

Beverly, I know that
we don't bring out the best in each other,

but something wonderful
did come from our relationship.

That young man, right there.

I couldn't agree more.

That's beautiful.

- Thank you. All right, let's continue.
- SHELDON: <i>Excuse</i> me.

I need to say something
to someone pretty special,

and I just can't wait any longer.

- It's happening.
- Leonard.

You and I have our ups and downs,

but I have always
considered you my family.

Even before
the recent threat of our parents

fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits.

I don't always show it,
but you are of great importance to me.

Both of you.

(CLICKS TONGUE) AW!

Thank you.

Okay.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

And weird other husband
who came with the apartment.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

Thank you for taking us to the airport.

Hey, I'm just thrilled
we're all getting along for a minute.

Yeah, me, too.

Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.

Water under the bridge, Alfred.

Leonard, why don't you
get into the carpool lane?

Well, that's a solid line,
he can't cross it.

It's okay, I can make it over.

No, no, let's plod along. It'll make your
father feel more comfortable.

What makes me comfortable is knowing
I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning,

and see your sour face.

Do the world a favor,
and don't wake up tomorrow morning.

It was almost a minute.

There's a lot of traffic,
are we gonna be okay?

You'll be at the airport
an hour before your flight.

Good, thank you.

Plenty of time for you
to meet another geriatric boy toy.

Hey. I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

Yes, ma'am.

Sheldon, your mother's
an attractive woman.

You need to get used to the fact
that men are gonna be interested in her.

And you need to drive the car
and mind your business.

I will not have you
be disrespectful to me.

- You're not my mother.
- Don't you be disrespectful to her!

Yes, ma'am.

You'll get there,
you just gotta put some zing on it.

Penny, I don't know
what I was worried about.

Your friends are just lovely.

Thanks, Mom.

Although, that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.

Is he? I never noticed.

Reminds me of that turkey we had,
who drowned looking up at the rain.

-(ALL LAUGH)
- That was great.

Cops, cops. Be cool!

English - SDH

HOWARD: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

Hello.

I'm looking for a Howard Wolowitz.

May I ask what this is about?

- No, you may not.
- Oh.

Very well.

Hi, Colonel Williams. How can I help you?

Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

Caltech is fine.
Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

I may not?

That's what he said to me.

Look at this.

Elon Musk has a theory

that we're all just characters

in some advanced civilization's
video game.

So, some alien kid spent his money

on the asthma and glasses upgrade for me?

Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.

- All right, we got a problem.
- What's up?

The Air Force contacted me
about our quantum gyroscope.

- They wanna have a meeting.
- Really?

Yeah, this military guy
showed up at Howard's door.

He was terrifying.

Oh, what did he say?

He gave me his business card
and asked me to

please pass it along to Howard.

(STAMMERS) That doesn't sound terrifying.

To a white guy born here, no.

To a brown guy whose name
has a lot of syllables in it,

terrifying.

You realize if the military
declares our research classified,

they can take the whole thing
away from us.

Yeah, and if that happens, we'll never
be able to sell it commercially.

There goes our big payday.

I was counting on that money.
I need to make as much as my wife

so I don't have to try so hard in bed.

- You do that, too?
-(SCOFFS) Yeah.

How do you think I stay this thin?

Gentlemen, I think we are
losing sight of the real issue.

We are on the precipice

of becoming faceless cogs

in the military-industrial complex.

Isn't that exciting?

- Well, you're kidding, right?
- Not at all.

Look, look... In Star Wars,

when the stormtroopers
would march in perfect formation,

harassing civilians,

didn't you ever think,
"Hey, that could be me"?

Sheldon, we could be contributing
to a weapons system

that oppresses mankind
for the next 1,000 years.

Okay, Howard's on board.
What do you think, Leonard?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

I'm worried about Howard.

Ever since that guy
from the Air Force showed up,

he's been a nervous wreck.

All right,
we work at a giant pharmaceutical company.

Get him some anti-anxiety meds.

He won't take any pills
that aren't chewable

and shaped like a Flintstone.

You know,
when Leonard's feeling anxious,

I make him take a long walk.

- Does that help?
- Uh, for a while,

then he comes back.

- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

This guy from the office just
congratulated me on being pregnant.

You did already know, right?

(SCOFFS) No one at the office did.

- Did you tell anyone?
- No, you told me not to.

I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus.

She might've heard me
throwing up one morning.

Ever since she got that hearing aid,

she thinks she's so great.

Why don't you want anyone to know?

Because, I'm up for
a major immunotherapy study

and if they find out I'm pregnant,
they might give it to someone else.

Would they really do that?

I know they would.
They did it to Barbara Chen last year

when I told everyone she was pregnant.

Wait till I Snapchat

that my friends might be working
on a top secret government project.

Are you crazy?
You can't put that on Snapchat.

Fine, I'll put it on Facebook
like a caveman.

You know, maybe before our meeting,

we should talk to a lawyer.

That's not a bad idea.

Yeah, you must have someone
in your family that's a lawyer.

Why? Because I'm Jewish?

That's like me saying,
"Hey, you're Indian.

"Doesn't your cousin
work in a call center?"

My cousin does work in a call center.

And my cousin's a lawyer.

We don't need Howard's cousin.

We have me.

You're not a lawyer, Sheldon,
you're just a know-it-all.

I am not a know-it-all.

I'm a person who knows lots of things

and likes to correct other people
when they're wrong.

That's the definition
of being a know-it-all.

<i>Or in German,</i> a <i>Besserwisser.</i>

How did you think you were
gonna hide your pregnancy?

I had a plan.
I kept leaving DOVEBAR wrappers around

to explain any weight gain.

Where did you get
empty DOVEBAR wrappers?

From all the DOVEBARs I ate.

I'm pregnant, try to keep up!

I'm sorry, I have to go
find out if my boss knows.

Well, whatever happens,
we're here for you.

Thanks, you guys are the best.

Drive safe, we love you,
and give us a call when--

Oh, my God, it was me, it was me.

I'm the one who blabbed she's pregnant!

<i>- What?
- I didn't mean to.</i>

It just slipped out in front of
her assistant one day. I feel--

- Excuse me, I forgot my coat.
- Oh! Here's your coat, honey.

That's such a cute jacket. (WHINES)

God, I feel so bad.
ljust lied to her.

Oh, but you did it so well.
That's amazing.

It's like watching a sculptor

but your clay was lies.

Is that really what's important right now?

Seriously, you have got to let me

scan your brain
when you're being dishonest,

so I can see what lights up.

That's just super helpful, Amy.

Thanks a lot, I can't wait to do that.

I can see a clump of bitch cells
lighting up from here.

Gimme a second to call my cousin.

I don't see how a tax lawyer
from Fort Lauderdale

could be helpful
regarding intellectual property.

First of all, he's in Boca Raton

which is better than Fort Lauderdale.

But, more importantly,

he lasted two days on Jeopardy,

so he's clearly a smart guy.

(RINGING ON MONITOR)

<i>Hello.</i>

Hey, Marty.
Thanks for talking to us.

<i>Yeah, no problem.
Thanks for going to outer space</i>

<i>so no matter what I do
my mom will be disappointed in me.</i>

Well, I married a little Catholic girl,

so, we're even.

Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon.
The three of us

-came up with the guidance system.
- Hi.

- Hello.
- And this is my friend, Raj.

Oh, I'm not on the patent.
I'm just here

because there's a bumblebee in my office.

I saw it. It's big.

Anyway, like I said in the email,

this meeting's on Thursday.

Do you have any advice for us?

<i>Well, I don't know much
about patent law.</i>

<i>But my advice is</i>

<i>hear them out,
offer as little information as possible</i>

<i>and whatever you do,
don't sign anything.</i>

Don't sign anything?
That's your advice?

Okay, so, if during this meeting

one of us were to, say,

complete an oil painting,

you'd recommend that
we leave that unsigned?

- That's not what <i>I</i> meant.
- That's what you said.

<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

This must be how you
practice law in Boca Raton.

By saying things you don't mean
and meaning things you don't say.

<i>Howard, why is he yelling at me?</i>

All right, you were on Jeopardy.

Allow me to Alex Trebek this
and put it in the form of a question.

Who has been
a complete waste of our time?

Marty, let me call you back.

Someday, when I'm up on murder charges,

you'll be hearing from me.

You don't need him.
I'll represent you.

- Hi.
- Hey, what brings you by?

Oh! I had to go to a sales seminar
on our new sleeping pill.

- Oh, how was it?
- Great!

- Fall asleep?
-In, like, two minutes.

So, how is everything going around here?

You still upset about people
finding out you're pregnant?

I'm furious.

Sure. Sure.

Uh, did you ever figure out who told?

No. I confronted Barbara Chen,

but she claimed she didn't know
what I was talking about.

Hmm, well, I guess it's just gonna

remain a mystery, you know,

like, whatever happened in that seminar
after they dimmed the lights. (LAUGHS)

It had to be Barbara.

I've been trying to figure out
a way to get back at her.

Do you think using her work computer
to Google "how to be a prostitute"

is over the line?

Um, you know,
when I was in high school,

there was this girl who was
talking about me behind my back.

So, me and all my friends,
we cornered her in the bathroom

and forgave her.

What kind of revenge is that?

This woman screwed with my job.
She's gotta pay.

Okay. All right, honey, you know what?
(SIGHS)

There was something I was too scared
to tell you yesterday

and now, I'm just balls-out terrified
to tell you.

But the truth is

it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.

I'm the reason everyone knows.

- Why would you do that?
- No. It was an accident.

I am so sorry I lied.

Get out.

(PENNY SIGHS)

Oh, you know, I also

lied about the girl in the bathroom.

Yeah, we actually dunked
her retainer in the toilet

and put it back in her mouth.

I don't understand why
I can't talk at this meeting.

'Cause when you talk,
it enrages people.

Okay. Quick question,

am I allowed to exchange pleasantries

upon meeting this colonel?

- Yes.
- Am I allowed to inform him

that Colonel Sanders was
never actually in the military?

- L'm getting enraged.
- Fine.

Ooh, can I use text-to-speech software?

- No!
- Don't speak.

<i>AUTOMATED VOICE: AW, nuts.</i>

Gentlemen, I'm Colonel Williams.

Thank you for meeting with me.

- Hi.
- Hello.

So, which one of you is
the brains behind all of this?

(STUTTERS) It's a group effort,

but I guess if we had to
pick a main brain

that would be me. (CHUCKLES)

Mmm-mmm.

And, because of the quantum vortices
this can run perpetually?

Exactly. Yeah, you have
a good grasp of the physics.

Well, I'm a scientist by training.

Really, you're a physicist?

Better. I'm an engineer.

Where did you go to school?

- MIT.
- What? Hey, me, too.

I should have known. Behind every
great invention is an MIT mind.

I'll cut to the chase.

The Air Force believes there's
an application for this technology

and we're interested
in funding your research.

Well. Thanks, but you should know,

we're a little concerned about
this being used in weapons.

Oh, well,
let me put your mind at ease.

What we use it for is
none of your business.

I don't know how I feel about this.

Look, guys,
it's just a guidance system.

It's not like you're handing us
the Death Star from Star Trek.

All you need to worry about is,

right now it's this big,

and we need it to be this big.

That's a lot less big.

Yes. It's this much less big.

I'm not even sure that's possible.

Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT

and they thought they could
get it done in four months.

- Four months?
- Yeah, we'll do it in two! (CHUCKLES)

Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

I'm the actual brains behind this project.

Also, engineers aren't real scientists,

MIT's a trade school,

and the Death Star
is from Star Wars, not Star Trek.

Otherwise, thank you for your service.

Hi, Howard told me
you were working late,

-so I brought dinner.
- Oh, thanks.

You know, I just wanted
to get some work done

without people congratulating me

about the baby every five minutes.

I spent my day alone in the lab
waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.

Did you come here to
bring me dinner or to gloat?

Well, I came to see how you were feeling

- but I'm guessing still angry?
- (SIGHS)

I'm sorry, my boss wants to meet with me
and I'm stressing.

You really think they're gonna
start treating you differently?

Are you kidding?
I've always been treated differently!

Look at me! Listen to me!

I mean, the first thought
when you see me isn't,

"That's a scientist,"

It's, "I wonder if her mommy
knows where she is."

I am really regretting that
I got you a Happy Meal.

I've worked so hard to get where I am,

and I don't want to get
sent back to square one

-because I'm pregnant.
-(SIGHS)

I understand how you feel.

Thank you.

I wish there was some way
I could make it better.

Well, you brought me French fries,
that's a start.

Uh, actually I got you apple slices,
'cause you're pregnant.

Apple slices?

What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's
and gets fruit?

I'll be right back.

And a chocolate shake!

<i>- H i.
- Hello.</i>

- What are you doing?
- Oh, Leonard's mad at me

so I'm making him lemon bars.

Does he even like lemon bars?

Hmm, not really.

But I'm mad at him, too,

so, lemon bars it is.

Something happen at the meeting?

They made me promise I wouldn't talk.

- And you talked.
- Well now, see?

You knew what was gonna happen,
why didn't they?

Anyway, now we're committed
to completing this project

in a ridiculously short time frame

and everyone's upset with me.

Well, if it makes you feel any better,
Bernadette's mad at me, too.

Mmm. If it makes you feel any better,

a parasitoid wasp

known as Oobius depressus

has been rediscovered after 101 years

of presumed extinction.

Why would that make me feel better?

Well, why would your Bernadette thing
make me feel better?

- At least mine was educational.
- Okay.

- Never mind.
- Look, I'm sorry.

Tell me why
Bernadette is upset with you.

Well, I told people at work
that she's pregnant.

She wasn't ready for them to know.

- Why would you do that?
- Well, it just slipped out.

- I feel terrible.
- See, that's exactly what happened to me.

Except that I said it on purpose
and I have no regrets.

Is it even possible to get
this done in two months?

Maybe, I don't know.
We'll have to work

12 hours a day, seven days a week.

Which means I won't be able
to make Penny breakfast every day,

and she'll realize my brioche French toast

was the only thing
keeping her in the marriage.

- I love your French toast.
- Oh, thanks, man.

So, why did you guys
even agree to the deadline?

We didn't, Sheldon did.

And you just let him?

Well, the colonel said it was
for the good of the country

and the funding is substantial--

But, mostly there was an awkward pause

and I broke it by saying, "Okay."

So, I guess I won't be
seeing you guys for a while.

Oh, looks like it.

Wow, you're going off
to work with the military

leaving me behind.

Now, I know how all those army wives feel.

(SCOFFS) Would you stop? We're just
gonna be on the other side of campus.

And, right here.

You are a deeply silly man.

He is so afraid of his feelings.

Oh, hi.

- Got a minute?
- Yeah. Come on in.

I just wanted to apologize.

I know what you did was an accident.

Oh, thank you.
And I'm sorry I lied about it.

Well, for what it's worth,
you're a great liar.

Aw, that's what Amy said.

So, what's going on
with the research project?

Are they going to let you run it?

Well, my boss said
he hadn't decided yet.

So, I gently reminded him
that he's an old rich white guy

and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady

who's not afraid to cry
in front of a jury.

You threatened to sue?

Hey, I learned a long time ago

when you're 4'11"
and eye level with every guy's crotch,

that's where you punch.

That's funny,
I learned something totally different.

You know what?
It's just a research project.

The most important job in the world
is gonna be raising this child.

It's all I need to give my life meaning.

Aw, that's so beautiful.

You believe me? Oh, good.

Eleven more chumps like you,
I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.

I never realized
this building was classified.

Maybe that's because it's classified.

Wish we weren't so far
from my parking space.

The way you put away
those lemon bars,

perhaps that's a good thing.

I'd like to reinstate
the "you not talking" rule.

Why? It clearly doesn't work.

I guess this is it. (CHUCKLES)

<i>LEONARD". Is that a retinal scanner?</i>

Let's find out. (CHUCKLES)

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Howard Wolowitz, <i>access</i> granted.

- No way!
-Impressive.

My turn, my turn!

<i>Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.</i>

I didn't even have to take my glasses off!

<i>Access denied.</i>

- It knows!
- It knows!

Oh, oh, oh, guys,
hold me upside down!

<i>Howard Wolowitz, access granted.</i>

ALL: <i>Yay!</i>

English - SDH

It's pretty late.

Think I've got time to
run some more simulations

on the cooling system?

Sure. I'm still figuring out
the thermo-acoustic expander.

Yeah, while you do that

lam going to pump cerebral spinal fluid
through my brain cells

to remove the metabolic byproducts
of the day's thoughts.

What?

It's called sleep and it's my bedtime,
nighty-night, y'all.

Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.

And we only have two months
to deliver this to the Air Force

because of you.

(YAWNING) <i>I</i> know, I was there.

Well, wake up!

We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.

How late?

Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00.

One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.

If you're tired, have some coffee.

What? You have some coffee.

I am having coffee!

And look how irritable it's making you!

Guys!

We're not gonna get anything done
if we start fighting.

Now, can you please
try to soldier through?

(SIGHS) Fine.

(CLOCK TICKING)

I don't think I can go much longer.

It's been three and a half minutes,
wake up.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

I had a bad dream
that my best friend became a tyrant

and forced me to
stay up all night to work.

I had a good dream that
when I carried you to bed

I let your head hit the wall
and I laughed.

- Good morning.
- What is this?

Well, we didn't see you last night,
we're not gonna see you today,

so we thought we could have
breakfast together.

That is so nice.

Ow! It does hurt!

So, what are you guys gonna do today?

Well, Sheldon was supposed to
go to this party with me this afternoon,

but I don't think that's happening.

Oh, that was never happening.

I'll go, I like a party.

Well, I mean, to be honest,
it's not like a "party" party,

it's more like a gathering

where scientists of different
disciplines get together

to share their work and keep current
on what's going on in other fields,

I don't know
why I called it a party, sorry.

It's okay, I'll still go.

You don't think you'll be bored?

I'll have some wine

and listen to people go on
about crap I don't understand.

I mean, how is it any different
than every single day of my life?

I won't be there.

Look at that, it is a party.

PENNY; Yeah.

Sorry I have to work all weekend.

It's okay.

Thanks again for breakfast.

Well, I didn't get to see you last night.

The least I could do.

You shouldn't have
made the alarm code his birthday.

So, what should we do today?

I appreciate it, but you don't have to
spend your day off with me.

Well, I don't mind.

Oh, you wanna go to the mall
and look at baby stuff?

Not really.

Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel

and get sideways glances
from racist old ladies.

I get enough of that when I take Howard

to my grandmother's for Christmas.

Oh, I know.

Why don't we get started on
clearing out the baby's room?

Isn't it a little early for that?

You have to get to it eventually.

(GROANS) There's so much junk in there,
it's embarrassing.

How can you be embarrassed around me?

I'm gonna be in the room with you
when you give birth.

I don't think you are.

You didn't think I was gonna be
in your kitchen this morning,

yet here I am.

<i>- THE FLASH: Psst! Hey, ma.
{GASPS)</i>

What?

You look tired.
Why don't you have an energy drink?

Everyone's doing it.

Oh, no, thank you,
those have caffeine in them.

Oh, sorry, I thought you were cool.

I am cool.

This is Yoo-hoo,

chocolate milk's delicious, watery cousin.

All right, but if you ever wanna
feel like you have superpowers,

try one of these.

Superheroes take
performance-enhancing chemicals?

<i>You bet.</i>

You know why Hulk is so strong?

Steroids.

You know why Batman wanders around
at night getting into fights?

Scotch.

I am facing a great deal of work.

And I do like things better when
famous people also like them.

Here. It's on the house.

The first one's free?

Flash, how do you stay in business?

You wanna know my secret?

I bought stock in Marvel.

Hi, Bert. This is my friend Penny.

- Hi.
- Hey. Come on in.

I'm gonna go turn on some rock music.

- That's a geology joke.
-(PENNY CHUCKLES)

Bert's a geologist.

And a joker.

How early are we?

Oh, actually, we're an hour late.

I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.

I don't even know where to begin.

Well, in The Sound of <i>Music,</i>
Julie Andrews says,

"Let's start at the very beginning.
A very good place to start."

Huh. I was gonna start at the end,
thank God you're here.

Well, I think the first thing
we should get rid of is that tone.

Sorry.

I should probably keep this
in case we have a girl.

Ah, that's a nice one.
Was it yours when you were little?

My dad built it for me.

Wow, that's so cute.

This was the husband, this was the wife.

They'd go out on adventures together.

Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.

That was really me just
duct taping them to our dog.

- And did they have kids?
- They did.

But the mommy and daddy didn't like them

so they shipped them off to an orphanage
I made out of a shoebox.

Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

Not every girl dreams about being a mom.

Sometimes you think
you're never gonna have kids

and one day you wake up
and you're pregnant.

And it doesn't matter that your
career's going great right now

and that you and your husband
never even got to go anywhere

taped to a dog!

I skipped spin class for this.

Why is it taking him so long
to get a drink out of a vending machine?

Well, it's complicated.

He finds pushing that little door
and reaching up into the machine

uncomfortably intimate.

Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

To quote The Martian,
"Let's science the feces out of this!"

<i>And that... That's The Martian the book
and The Martian the</i> movie,

not Marvin the Martian.
Although, to quote Marvin the Martian,

(AS MARVIN THE MARTIAN)
"I claim this planet in the name of Mars."

Are you okay?

Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.

I had my first energy drink
and I feel great.

Hey, you guys wanna wrestle?

We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.

Nah, we're not fat enough
or wearing diapers.

You wanted him awake.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

So should we talk to each other or mingle?

I don't know where everyone is.

Yeah, I mean,

I could see him eating one or two guests
but not a whole party.

Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.

You don't have to stay.

I'm gonna start cleaning up.

Okay.

I feel so bad about leaving him here.

Well, that's funny, I was just
thinking the same thing about you.

Hey, listen,

could you not say anything about this
to the people at the university?

You know, 'cause you're you and I'm me,
and it's kind of embarrassing.

Wait, what do you mean she's her?

Well, you know how Amy's
the coolest girl on campus, right?

- No!
- No.

Oh, yeah, everybody thinks so.

What?

You tell me about your foot fungus
but this is a secret?

I'm sure it's just 'cause
I'm dating Sheldon.

Actually, I think Sheldon's popular
because he's dating you.

Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?

(HOWARD GROANS)

Maybe we should break for lunch.
What time is it?

(MOANING)

According to the world's
worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

My head hurts
and I'm more tired than ever.

Why don't you just go home?

No, I can do this.

I just... ljust need
another energy drink.

Oh, no.

What?

I want another one.

So?

That's a craving.

That's a sign of chemical dependency.

You only had one.

I know, but plenty of things are addictive
after a single exposure.

Crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.

You know once one pops
one just can't stop.

You can't develop a problem that fast.

You wanna bet?
Oh, great, now I'm addicted to gambling.

- We can't afford to lose any more time.
-(SIGHS)

Well, this probably won't work

but has anyone ever tried to just haul off

and whoop the crazy out of him?

That's not helpful.

It's fun to think about
but it's not helpful.

Hey ,

Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.

We can't do this without you.
Can you please pull it together?

I'm sorry, yes, of course.

Thank you.

Just please bear with me

if I display symptoms
of caffeine withdrawal.

No worries.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

You guys stink.

Sorry I flipped out on you.
I think it's just hormones.

I think you were mean
before you were pregnant, but it's fine.

So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room,

why don't we just decide on a theme
for the nursery?

Does it really need one?

Of course it does, didn't your
baby room have a theme?

Well, it doubled as my dad's office
and he was a cop.

So, I guess the theme was
bloody homicide photos.

<i>Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.</i>

But, anyway,

why don't we just take a step back
and start with the color?

Right? There's so many amazing ones.

Red, blue, green, purple--

Are you just gonna name all the colors?

Well, not now.

I don't care what color the room is.

Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.

Well, you're not. So just drop it.

<i>I'm clearly upset,
why aren't you following me?</i>

Sorry, sorry!

And when Amy started using a solution
of chromic acid and white vinegar

to clean all her lab equipment,

all of a sudden, everybody was doin' it.

You trendsetter!

It was just the right idea
at the right time.

Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.
Tell me about Leonard.

Who?

Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh, him. I guess he's all right.

Apparently he tricked some hot girl
into marrying him.

That's me! I'm her!

And you know, he didn't trick me.
He just wore me down.

Makes sense you two are friends.

I mean, hot girls always stick together.

And you thought this wasn't
gonna be a great party.

You know, I had no idea,
Caltech is exactly like my high school.

Well, it's not exactly like it.

You know, we're all extremely smart.

Wow, you popular girls are mean.

(GROANS) I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

Uh, you're really going to have caffeine
in front of me

while I'm trying to get my life
back on track?

Okay.

Let's pretend you do have a problem.

- I do.
- You don't.

- Yeah, but I do.
- No, you don't!

But let's say you do
and don't say you do because you don't!

Well, wouldn't you think that
throwing yourself into your work

would be the best way to deal with it?

- With what?
- Your problem.

I thought I didn't have a problem.

That was painful to watch.

- So, where are we going?
- I don't know.

Okay.

<i>How Thelma and Louise of us.</i>

Raj, why don't I care about anything?

I'm sorry?

It's my baby, I should care about
nurseries and colors and I don't.

What's wrong with me?

Well, crime scene photos
near your crib spring to mind.

I keep waiting to feel excited
but it's not happening.

(SIGHS) What if it never happens?

Bernadette,

come on, look,
you're over-thinking this, okay?

You're gonna be an amazing mom.

Even if you don't believe it,
I know you have maternal instincts.

Once I was supposed to
babysit my brothers,

our neighbor found them naked in
the backyard eating crickets.

Happy and well-fed. You see, that's
what I'm taking from that story.

Leonard, can I ask you a question?

Is it about the rotational symmetries
you should be figuring out

or your fake caffeine problem?

Howard, can I ask you a question?

No.

All right, I'll just toss this
out to the room.

Um, I was thinking that the best way
to fight my addiction

is by weaning myself off in steps.

Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch

but I did find what claims to be
a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.

Yeah. You know, there's an
interesting fact about the rectum--

Sheldon!

We are dealing with an impossible deadline

from the Air Force because of you.

So, have an energy drink,
don't have an energy drink.

Order suppositories and shove them
wherever you want, I don't care!

You don't shove them, they come
with an easy-glide applicator.

Right.

Listen to me, we can't do anything
until you do your part.

So, get up in front of this whiteboard
and do it!

- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

No...

I can't figure out the math.

I've been racking my brain for days
and I've got nothing.

Seriously?

No, I can't do it.

I'm not as smart as I think I am.

I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.

It's okay. We'll figure something out.

But what if we can't?

It'll be fine.

You'll see.

Sheldon?

Buddy?

(SNORING)

When the baby gets here
you gotta teach me that.

Thank you so much, Bert, this was great.

My pleasure.

You girls wanna take home
a two-gallon tub of potato salad?

- I think we're good.
- Mmm.

Okay, well, thanks for coming by.

You're nice people.

Well, so are you.

In fact, you know what?
We will never take you for "granite."

Did you get that?

Granite? It's a little geology joke.
(CHUCKLES)

You need to leave,
I'm in love with both of you now.

- Okay.
- Bye.

Uh, pull over.

Why, who are you calling?

You're gonna rat me out to Howard,
aren't you?

You're such a snitch.
No wonder I don't like you.

Whoa! I'm calling my dad. Okay?

He's got experience dealing
with pregnant ladies

because he's an OB-GYN,

and experience with crazy ladies
because of my mom.

(LINE RINGING)

<i>Hello, Rajesh.</i>

<i>- Are you calling to ask for money?
- No.</i>

<i>Are you calling to ask for things
that cost money?</i>

<i>- No.
- Great, what's up?</i>

Okay, this is my friend Bernadette.

She's pregnant and she's a bit worried.

So, I thought maybe you could talk to her.

<i>Of course. What seems to be the trouble?</i>

Something's wrong.

I don't care about any of the baby stuff
every other mom is so into.

Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.

<i>Look, some people are baby people
and some people are not baby people.</i>

<i>It doesn't mean you won't
love your own baby.</i>

But I thought I'd be more excited.

<i>Being excited isn't
a guarantee of anything.</i>

<i>Rajesh's mother was thrilled
when she was pregnant with him.</i>

<i>After he was born,
she doted on his every move.</i>

<i>And you know what happened?</i>

<i>He broke her heart,
moved halfway around the world</i>

<i>and dates only poor white women.</i>

<i>So, you never know.</i>

Thank you, I feel better now.

I don't!

<i>Good. Bernadette,
I hope you have a daughter.</i>

Uh, I don't really know how to say this...

Well, you could try starting with "sir."

Right, sorry, sir.

He said start with it, not end with it.

Sir,

we've hit a bit of a snag.

We're already behind schedule.

The computations required to
overcome the deployability issues

are more significant than we thought.

I understand that we're under contract

and I don't know what the
consequences of violating that are.

But, um, we're not gonna be able to
deliver in the time we promised.

(SIGHS)

How long do you need?

(CLEARS THROAT) We're thinking two years.

All right.

That's it? You're okay with that?

(SCOFFS) What, you think you're
the first government contractor

who isn't gonna deliver on time?

We're still waiting for
a big space laser Reagan ordered

to beat the commies.

Thanks for understanding, sir.

Yes, thank you so much.

We, we really appreciate it.

<i>LEONARD". All right, pressure's off.</i>

<i>HOWARD: (SIGHS) Wanna see a <i>movie?
SHELDON: Popcorn's on me.</i>

English - SDH

There was water everywhere,
it was such a mess.

That stinks.
How long are you out of the apartment?

About five weeks.

PENNY: Ugh!
Did you lose anything valuable?

Well, the pipe was over my closet,
so all my clothes are gone.

Oh, so, nothing. Great.

- Do they know why the pipe burst?
- They didn't say.

Buildings that have a combination
of copper and galvanized steel

are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion

caused by the mobility of ions
in the water.

Can't have your head shoved
in a toilet as much as I did

and not pick up a few things
about plumbing.

Well, if you need a place to crash,
you can stay with us.

Really?

Of course, you can stay in Leonard's room
and we'll stay at my place.

- You sure that's not an inconvenience?
- No, not at all.

LEONARD: And We live with Sheldon,

so the word inconvenience
has really lost all meaning.

So, technically I'd be moving in
with my boyfriend?

I guess so. And I finally get to
live alone with my husband.

Oh, my, this is a big step.

Mmm-hmm. For two of us,
it's in the right direction.

Why are you all smiling like crazy people?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Cohabitation with my girlfriend?
That's a great deal to process.

- Mmm. It's only for five weeks.
- Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.

What do you think?

I don't know, what if living together
kills the romance?

Okay, you guys had sex one whole time.
Nothing can put out a fire like that.

Yeah, but what happens when we
each get a peek behind the curtain?

I mean, she...
She's never even seen me unshaven!

You just shaved yesterday,
you're good for three months.

Sheldon, I understand your apprehension,
but let me appeal to the scientist in you.

Given the five-week end date,

isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

and collect data on our compatibility?

Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

Okay, Star Trek, the original series.

The Enterprise was on a five-year mission
to explore new worlds.

Think of this as your personal
five-week mission to do the same.

Well, if you want to lure me in
with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

Don't be proud of that.

So, is that a yes?

Not yet. I...

How will I learn
if I'm comfortable living with Amy,

or just comfortable
because I'm in my own apartment?

You know, if this experiment is going to
be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.

Well, where would you go?

Well, ideally, an enclosed,
self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico,

where we would eat crops
fertilized with our own waste.

And you were worried about the romance.

Okay, why don't you guys stay
across the hall and we will live here?

Interesting. If my official residence
were across the hall,

I wonder if I'd need to knock
every time I came over here.

That's a good question.
Maybe just don't come over.

You know, historically,
I don't do well with change.

Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't
even sit in your spot while you're gone.

You're darn right, you wouldn't.

No matter where I am,
this will always be my spot.

Like an embassy in a foreign country,

this seat is the sovereign soil
of my bottom.

Just nod and smile, he's almost gone.

Sheldon, what do you think?

(EXHALES)

- Very well, I'm on board.
- Seriously?

Yes. I accept this five-week mission to
share a living space with my girlfriend.

(SIGHS) Oh, this is so exciting.

Well, now don't be surprised if
like Star Trek, it's canceled in three.

I have to say,
I am happy with your OB-GYN.

(CHUCKLES) Cool. 'Cause she says
you're doing a great job as

"Weird friend who doesn't have to be
at every appointment."

I'm the son of a gynecologist.
I could be helpful.

It would help if you stopped telling me
I have a textbook cervix.

The polite response is,
"Thank you for noticing."

- Let me see the sonogram again.
-(CHUCKLES)

Oh, yeah! That's a good-looking baby
for a little gray blob.

Yeah, we could name him Blobert.

What if it's a girl?

Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an

Are we being silly
not finding out the sex?

Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

If you want, you can find out right now.

- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-mmm.

The doctor's gone for the day,
so it doesn't matter.

Or somebody else knows
because they saw it in the folder.

- You looked in our folder?
- It was an accident!

The doctor left the folder on her desk.
It's not my fault I opened it and looked.

So, you know the sex of our baby
and we don't?

Flip a coin, you got a fifty-fifty shot.

-(SCOFFS) God, Raj!
- That's unbelievable!

But this is not a problem, okay?

If you don't wanna know,
I don't have to tell you.

We don't want you to know!

Yeah, okay, well, that's a problem.

You know, I'm very proud of you
for trying to live with Amy.

- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm.

Of course, the ideal way
to conduct this experiment would be

with four pairs of identical
Sheldons and Amys.

You know, one pair that was
neither dating nor living together,

one pair that was dating
but not living together,

one pair that was living together
but not dating,

and then, of course one pair
that was living together and dating.

Although, with that many Sheldons it'd be
such a party we'd never get anything done.

That was a cute story. So, um...

What did you wanna ask me?

Well, you've lived with
your significant other for some time.

I would like this experiment to go well.
Are there any insights you can share?

Mmm. Well, the biggie is,
if she has an insane roommate,

kick him out as soon as possible.

You know, Leonard and I were very happy
before you came along.

You've been roommates with Sheldon
forever. Do you have any advice?

I'm trying to think of an answer
that won't stop you from doing this.

I know it sounds like a clichÃ©,
but compromise is key.

Never leave a belt on the floor.
At night, they look like snakes.

Do little things,
like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.

Keep M&Ms in your pocket in case
you have to wait in a long line.

You're gonna be seeing each other a lot,
so respect each other's personal space.

He startles easily.
So please, no flash photography.

How many pairs of underwear
did you pack for the move?

I don't know, I didn't count.

(SCOFFS) You truly are
the Goofus to my Gallant.

That's me. Listen...

You and I are going to be sharing a bed.

You know, this is uncharted territory
for both of us.

How are you feeling about that?

(SIGHS) Excited, concerned,
a little scared,

all the same emotions
I feel in line at Space Mountain.

Well, if you're nervous
about the sleeping arrangements,

maybe we should talk about it.

Okay...

Talk.

Well, I imagine one of your concerns
might be coital expectations.

Wow, no foreplay or anything,
just right to it.

Look, I know this experiment is
a big step outside of your comfort zone.

So, why don't we take being physical
off the table, and maybe later on,

once we're more settled in,
we can revisit it.

You're really okay with that?

I've never lived with someone, either.
This is a lot for me, too.

(SIGHS) This is such a relief.

I mean, honestly, if it didn't get you
all worked up I'd kiss you right now.

Good call, seeing your Teen Titans
underwear really got my motor running.

I know, they probably shouldn't
sell those to children.

- Well, here's your key.
- Thank you.

Enjoy having the place to yourselves.

You enjoy your mission to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

It's Penny's bedroom,
plenty of men have gone before.

Now, now, there's no need
to make this emotional.

Shall we?

I guess this is it.

You guys have fun.

You, too.

Oh, don't forget! Tuesday, the air filters
need to be changed.

Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

Oh, and every other day,
check the water level on the avocado pit.

I'm on it. 15 years from now,
we'll make guacamole together.

Leonard, please, let me go.

Come on, Sheldon.

Bye.

- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

That's it. For the next five weeks
we are officially living together.

I guess the experiment begins.

PENNY: <i>Whoo-hoo! We did it!
LEONARD: Yeah!</i>

Which side of the bed would you prefer?

Doesn't matter to me, your choice.

<i>No</i>, no, we're living together now,
everything is equal.

I know that I have a tendency
to be controlling,

so, I would rather you choose.

Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that,

but these things mean more to you
than they do to me, so, whatever you want.

Well, clearly it's not whatever I want
because what I want

is for you to make this decision
and you refuse to do that.

I'm not refusing,
I'm just trying to be considerate.

Like when you let me get those shoes
with the wheels on the bottom

and then watched me
roll right into traffic?

Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?

Fine.

(GROANS)

All right. Now, on this side I am
closer to the exit in case of emergency.

Great, that's your side.

No, but I'm also closer to the entrance
in case of attack.

Okay, I'll take that side.

Then again, what are the odds
of someone attacking me?

Rising rapidly!

Now, this side offers me
proximity to the bathroom,

but I am closer to the window
where perverts can watch me sleep.

Okay, what if we do this?

I suppose that works.

Great.

Although, now I'm kind of worried
someone's hiding behind those drapes.

This is ridiculous.

The doctor knows what the baby is,
the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows,

his <i>Grey's</i> Anatomy online fan group
probably knows.

Is it weird we don't?

I dunno, maybe the surprise
will make it more fun.

You know, like magic tricks.

Remember how disappointed you were
when I explained the never-ending hanky?

I was disappointed to see
the man I was engaged to

pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.

But, how delightful was it when I pulled
out a bouquet at the end of those scarves?

It'll be the same thing when the doctor
pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.

Everyone said I could do better.

Yeah, but you didn't listen,

and presto-change
my baby's inside you. Ta-da.

(AMY BRUSHING)

(AMY CLEARS THROAT AND SPITS)

<i>AMY: Ugh! What is that?</i>

Why did you switch sides?

Be grateful I'm still in the room.

Comfy?

Oh, I'm just happy I don't know
what this memory foam remembers.

Sheldon, I know we took coitus
off the table, but I was wondering

how you feel about other forms
of intimacy, such as snuggling?

Well, it's funny you should ask,
because I was wondering how you'd feel

about separating the two of us
with a pillow wall.

Sheldon, I've made more than enough
accommodations for you.

And we're both grown adults,
we've been far more intimate than this.

If you don't wanna snuggle, fine,
but we're not building a pillow wall.

(STAMMERS) I am sorry.

I'm just worried that my sensitivity to
temperature could make this a rough night.

And, no offense,
but your bottom radiates enough heat,

I'm surprised
there aren't iguanas lying on it.

That's it, it's Sheldon's bedtime.
He is in for the night.

Wow. I cannot believe we are alone
in our own apartment.

<i>It's weird.</i>

This must be how parents feel
when their kid goes off to college.

Unless they feel sad, then it's different.

So, what do you wanna do?

I know exactly what we are gonna do.

Really? You're a genius and
that's the first thing you come up with?

(SCOFFS)

Hey, Sheldon's not here,

so we are going to put on music
and dance in our underwear.

Ugh! Can we just have sex?

Oh, don't worry, once you see
my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.

(CHUCK BERRY some
"YOU NEVER CAN TELL" PLAYING)

Inevitable, you say?

I'll just let my hips do the talking.

- Screw it, I'm calling and finding out.
- Good, call him.

(CHUCKLES)

Wait, I'm not sure I wanna know.

- But, you just said you wanted to know.
- Well, now I don't know if I wanna know!

- Hello?
- Call you back.

No, Dr. Feynman, if I solve it for you,
you'll never learn.

(69 BOYZ SONG "TOOTSEE ROLL" PLAYING)

Wow, where did you learn these moves?

Well, the world may have forgotten
about Dance Dance Revolution,

but not this Smooth Criminal.

- Okay, you're positive you wanna know?
- Yes.

Here we go. It's ringing.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

- Hello?
- Wait.

Wrong number!

<i>Hart...</i>

<i>Hart...</i>

<i>Hart...</i>

<i>Hart...</i>

<i>Hart...</i>

<i>Hart...</i>

(INHALES)

I told you not to do the worm.

(WHEEZING) You were right.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

<i>BERNADETTE: I changed my mind,
hang up, hang up!</i>

(GRUNTS)

Oh.

(GROANS)

- What are you doing down there?
- Hang on.

Who are you calling?

(SCREAMS)

I'm so sore, I don't think
I slept two minutes last night.

Yeah, get it, girl.

It's not what you think.

I feel like I pulled something,
why didn't you tell me to stop?

Even more not what you think.

I don't know if I can make it through
five weeks living with him.

If you ever need a break,

the owner of the train store will let you
leave him there while you get a coffee.

Yeah.

Good morning.

Yeah, I didn't knock, but it's fine.

I didn't knock, but it's fine.
I didn't knock, but it's fine.

- So, how is everyone?
- Miserable and exhausted.

Really? I slept great.

Well, I didn't and it's your fault.

How? You had the whole floor to yourself.

Sheldon, maybe living together
is a bad idea.

Yeah, but what kind of
scientists would we be,

drawing a conclusion
after only 12 hours of data?

The kind who almost put a
pillow over your face last night.

Wow, I anticipated we'd have problems,

but I never thought your scientific rigor
would be one of them.

I'm sorry, are you questioning
my integrity as a scientist?

If the lab room
disposable shoe cover fits.

- Was that a science diss?
- Yeah.

- Was it a good one?
- Eh.

Mmm.

What would a theoretical physicist
understand about an experiment anyway?

I mean, you wouldn't know
a confounding variable

if two of them hit you in the face
at the same time.

And you don't even get that joke

'cause you don't even work
with confounding variables!

How dare you.

Oh, you heard me.
Your experimental bonafides are laughable.

Whoa, whoa, now you're making fun
of my bonafides?

Can't make fun of something
that's a null set.

- I feel like I should say "damn."
- Do it.

Damn!

Well, if you are so protective
of the scientific method,

perhaps we should use the next five weeks
to finish what we started.

Well, for science, maybe I will!

Yeah, for science, maybe you should!

- Fine! Good!
- Fine! Great!

You wanna go to our place and make out?

Does Stephen Hawking
roll through the quad?

The new neighbors are weird.

English - SDH

AMY: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

Cohabitation with my girlfriend?
That's a great deal to process.

Mmm. It's only for five weeks.

Let me appeal to the scientist in you.

Given the five-week end date,

isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

and collect data on our compatibility?

Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

Okay, Star Trek, the original series.

The Enterprise was on a five-year mission
to explore new worlds.

Think of this as your personal
five-week mission to do the same.

Well, if you want to lure me in
with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

Okay, why don't you guys stay
across the hall and we will live here?

(EXHALES)

- Very well, I'm on board.
- Seriously?

Yes. I accept this five-week mission to
share a living space with my girlfriend.

(SIGHS) Oh, this is so exciting.

Well, now don't be surprised if
like Star Trek, it's canceled in three.

Okay, I'm confused,
which one is Mr. Robot?

I'll give you a hint,

<i>we're watching Daredevil.</i>

Will you two please inform Amy

how much you enjoy
adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?

- Can't.
- Won't.

- Didn't.
- Don't

I told you, you can't regulate
every aspect of our lives.

I can if you'd just
roll over and accept your fate!

I'm sorry for bringing this over here.

Believe me, we know
what you're going through.

And I think the most helpful thing
we can tell you is, no backsies.

Sheldon, I understand
that you like things a certain way

and I'm willing to make some concessions,

but you have to be open to compromise.

- She's right, that's reasonable.
- Oh!

Look who's in favor of compromise,

the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.

Hey, she didn't compromise,
she settled, there's a difference.

Yeah. You tell 'em, babe.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

What time do you and Bernadette head out?

Well, as soon as I get home.
We're hoping to make it before dark.

I've never been to Palm Springs.

You should go, it's terrific.

I really thrive anywhere the women
and the temperature are over 90.

I don't know.

If I want to watch old people sweat
I can just FaceTime my family in India.

It's nice you and Bernadette
are getting away.

Well, she wants us to spend more time
together before the baby comes.

So then, what are you doing
here buying comic books?

Well, he wants us to
spend more time together

before the baby comes.

When you live with someone
there's gonna be conflict.

You just have to keep communicating.

Well, I'm open to that.

Okay, well, for starters,

there's nothing wrong with keeping
our toothbrushes in the same holder.

Sheldon, what do you say to that?

I think we should see other people.

What?

Well, as a male,
I have an evolutionary drive

to perpetuate my DNA.

And restricting myself
to a single partner,

it's against my nature.

We sleep together once a year!

You want other partners?

Don't blame me, blame your pal biology,

he's the pervert pulling the strings here.

You wanna see other people?
Go see other people!

I hope one of those people is a monkey
because this is bananas.

Hey, you can make jokes,

but if this keeps up
he's gonna move back in here.

Right, well, let's at least
get them apart for a while

so they can cool down.

Good. Then before we reintroduce them

we'll give him one of her sweaters

so he can get used to her scent again.

Wait, so it's okay for you to joke around?

Well, no, that's actually
what we did with him

when Howard came back from space.

Honey, how you feeling?

(BERNADETTE RETCHING)

The book says at this
stage of the pregnancy

morning sickness should be going away.

(COUGHING AND RETCHING)

So, that's good news, right?

<i>BERNADETTE: The only thing I hate more
than you right now is that book!</i>

(TOILET FLUSHING)

<i>HOWARD". There she is!</i>

Who's ready for a hot,
three-hour car ride to the desert?

Next vomit is going to be in your lap.

I'm sorry. We don't have to go.

But it's our last chance to take
a vacation that's just the two of us.

How about we stay here?

We don't even have to tell anyone,

it'll be like a secret vacation at home.

Keeping secrets from our friends,

it does sound kind of fun.

Does it sound

sexy?

You just heard me throwing up.

You bet I did.

You're so weird.

You know what's weird?

How turned on you are right now.

You know, people are quick to accuse me
of being difficult to live with,

but the truth is,
Amy is just as challenging.

- Just as challenging.
- Yes.

AS you?

Yes.

- Just as challenging as you?
- Yeah...

When we're sleeping she breathes on me.

Well, one night it got so bad

I almost grabbed Toto
and headed for the storm cellar.

Well, Leonard breathes on me, too.
It's not a big deal.

She's always complaining
about people at work.

Well, so does Leonard.

It's kind of annoying,
but it's not the end of the world.

Do you know that
when I get out of the shower,

she eyes me up and down
like I'm a piece of meat?

You know, so does Leonard!

Can't ljust get ready in the morning

without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?
"Hey!" (MOCK LAUGHS)

I know, sometimes I would just like
to be appreciated for my mind.

Agreed! Thank you!

That feels great.

Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear

isn't the only magic these hands can do.

In fact, what, what's
this between your toes?

Can you please stop making money
come out of me for two minutes?

(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)

- Was that the front door?
- It sounded like it.

-(FOOTSTEPS)
- Oh, my God, someone's in the house.

Lock the door, lock the door!

We should call the police.

I left my phone downstairs!

Damn, so did I.

Wait, I have my iPad!

What are we gonna do, email 911?

That's not helpful!

You know I rely on humor
in times of stress!

Let me know when you start,
because that wasn't funny!

(WATER RUNNING)

ls that the hot tub?

Who would use our hot tub?

Well, the answer is both

more and less disturbing than you think.

- Who is it?
- Stuart.

He heard me talking about us going away.

I guess he decided to invite himself over.

Should we say something to him?

Maybe. Wait, how about,

"Hey, you look like
a boiled chicken breast!"

I meant like, "What are you doing here?"

No, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.

Why is nothing easy with him?

Look, here's the thing you need
to understand about Sheldon,

he's the worst.

I prefer to think of it
as high-maintenance.

I prefer to think of myself as 5'10",

but I still need to get
all my pants hemmed.

Guess I should have known
what I was getting myself into.

Don't beat yourself up,
you've never lived with anyone before.

That's true.

And you're starting out
with Sheldon Cooper.

I mean, that's like getting your
first pet and having it be,

I don't know. What...

What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?

You're not making me feel better.

Look, even when Penny
and I started living together

there was a learning curve,

but, I promise you it does get easier.

He put a sign up
in the bathroom that says,

"Number of days without
Amy's hair on the soap."

Yeah, my record was six.

Is it me, or is there something fun
about watching him just float there?

Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.

Who just turned the porch lights on?

Is someone else here?

They must've left the tub on,

good thing I stopped by.

Ah...

(SCREAMING)

Oh, my God!

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

Maybe Howard and Bernadette
said I could be here?

Did they?

Just answer the question,
what are you doing here?

I had nothing else to do tonight.

Well, the last couple of months,

I come here when I know they're not home.

- What?
- They heard me in the bushes once,

but they thought it was a raccoon.

I told you raccoons don't say, "Uh-oh."

You know, one night Leonard's
nose whistled so loud,

I swear it was like
sleeping on a train track.

Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?

- Is it?
-(WHISTLES)

Ugh! It's like his sinuses
are right here in the car.

If we're just gonna
drive around aimlessly,

the least you could do
is take me for ice cream.

Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

Well, see?
Now why can't Amy be that subservient?

She has coitus one time,
suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor

will be a good place to meet other women.

Oh, please, you're barely interested in
a physical relationship with one person.

Why would you want to
confuse and disappoint others?

Being with Amy has awoken

the sexual creature within.

Well, when I see a pretty gal
walking down the street

I think, "Hubba, hubba"
like any other guy.

You kiss your mother with that mouth?

'Cause it's fine.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

Shall we toast?

To Howard and Bernadette,

and the house key
they never asked me to return.

You said you got it back!

Well, clearly I lied.

So, how's your apartment?

Not great, the electricity's out.

So, why don't you get it fixed?

I called and they're all like,
"Pay your bill!"

If you need somewhere to crash,
there's always my place.

No. I don't wanna be an inconvenience,

you've got all your lady friends and...

Actually I'm single now.

What? When did that happen?

It's okay, it's by choice.

Well, their choice and it's not okay.

Sorry. I didn't know.

Nobody does,

I was embarrassed,
so I didn't say anything.

Why wouldn't he tell us?
Are we bad friends?

He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.

Yeah, he deserves to be alone.

So, you're back out on
the dating scene now?

Yeah, yeah, a little.

Well, that must be fun. How's that going?

I'm in a hot tub with you, so, pretty bad.

Maybe I should just give in to
his stupid bathroom schedule.

No, don't do that.

- But you did!
- Exactly!

Learn from my mistakes.

No matter where I am, at 7:18 a.m.,

there better be a toilet nearby.

It's just so much easier
to give him what he wants.

Well, true.

But, think of how much
you've accomplished.

Who got him to stop
purelling his pocket change?

Me.

And who got him to put things other
than gloves in the glove compartment?

Me, it was mittens.

And who got him to try a turkey dog?

That was actually Koothrappali,
but I did let him spit it out in my hand.

How can you stop now?

That's like walking out of Pinocchio
right before he becomes a real boy.

You know, you're right,
I'm in this relationship, too.

I need to stand up for myself.

Of course you do.

And if he doesn't like it
he can move back here.

He can try,
he'd just need a good locksmith.

Well, who are you gonna hit on?

Girl in front of us got strawberry,
that's your favorite.

<i>No</i>, no, if we both like it,

I'll spend the rest of my life
opening the freezer and going,

"Oh. <i>No</i> strawberry."

What about the girl behind the counter?

Well, she spends her whole day scooping,

one arm's probably bigger than the other.

Is it possible you might not
actually want to meet someone?

You are truly wise.

Thank you.

I'd say wise beyond your years
but you're getting up there.

All right.

Come on, what is really going on with you?

Penny, lam going to tell you a story
that I've never told anyone.

All right.

I was 13 years old
and on spring break from college.

Not relating, go on.

I came home early because
they ran out of math to teach me.

Now I'm with you. Right.

My mother was at Bible study.

I walked in the house
expecting to find it empty

and I heard a sound
coming from my parents' bedroom.

When I opened the door, I saw my father

having relations with another woman.

- Oh, my... That's awful.
- I know.

It's also why I never open
a door without knocking three times.

The first one's traditional

but two and three are for
people to get their pants on.

Well, what happened with your dad?

We locked eyes, I ran to my room

and we never, ever spoke of it.

You poor thing.

Since Amy and I have been living together

we've been bickering
like my parents used to.

And you're afraid you're gonna
do something like your dad did?

Yes. I need to prepare her now

to save her from pain down the road.

Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted
to share a toothbrush holder with you

and now you're at an ice cream parlor
trying to pick up women!

Well, anything can sound silly
when you put it in that tone.

Honey, instead of worrying about
pain you may cause in the future,

how about trying to fix the pain
you're causing her right now?

(EXHALES)

I'm sure you're right.

And I suppose I should
apologize to you, as well.

- Okay.
- That must have hurt,

watching me look for other women
without ever even considering you.

Please understand that

I think of you as more of a nanny.

Just finish your ice cream
so I can get you home to bed.

I wonder if this is what it feels like
to be Bernadette's baby.

I don't know, Bernadette's baby
doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

hitting just the right spot.

Those jets are for
my secret spot, not his.

What do you do in there?

It's called relaxing
and that's all you need to know.

Well,

it's getting late,
maybe we should head home.

Yeah, probably right.

- You coming?
- Yeah, just give me a minute.

<i>Why'?</i>

Well, you know how you're
wearing a bathing suit?

Yeah?

I kind of went the other way.

You jackasses just bought
yourselves a hot tub!

- What do you think?
- It's a nice enough spot.

You know, if I'm going to start
standing up for myself,

-this is exactly the kind--
- Hi.

Oh, hi. Hi.

- Hello.
- How you guys doing?

We're doing good.
I think Sheldon has something

he would like to say to Amy.

(SIGHS)

I wanted to apologize
for my behavior today. It...

It was unnecessary.

This is warm.

Oh, and also,

lam willing to forego
the bathroom schedule.

- Really?
- Why does she get that? We never got that!

- Do you want him back?
-l'm very happy for you.

Amy, you should know,

I was never really interested
in seeing other women.

And to prove how serious I am about us,

I'm willing to take our relationship
to the next level.

Amy Farrah Fowler,

will you share this
toothbrush holder with me?

I would love to.

Did we really need to be here for this?

(VOICE BREAKING)
Call me crazy but I found it moving.

English - SDH

Hey, have you ever heard
of Van Nuys Comic-Con?

Yeah, it's a dinky little convention
where they sell collectibles

and get sad D-list celebrities to appear.
Why?

I got asked to sign autographs there.

That's awesome!

<i>Is this for Serial Ape-ist?</i>

Well, could be for the monkey movie,
it could be my hemorrhoid commercial.

The list does not go on.

- When is it?
- It doesn't matter, I'm not doing it.

- What? Why not?
- You just said yourself, it's sad.

Yeah, but it's not pathetic.
That's where I draw the line.

(SIGHS)

- Come on. We'll have fun.
- I don't know.

You'll have nerds fawning all over you.

If you don't love that,
this marriage is in trouble.

Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet
some fans and make a little extra money.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

An appearance
by George Lucas's dermatologist.

- I want that autograph.
- Oh, yeah.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

You know, with us living together, maybe
we could think about having people over.

We have people over all the time.

We have the maintenance people,
the pizza delivery man,

that UPS driver who feels the need to ask
how parts of me are hanging.

You know what I meant.

(SIGHS) All right. Fine.

Let's say that we were
to entertain people.

What type of gathering
did you have in mind?

A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner?
Afternoon tea? A formal tea?

Is it a party?
And if so, what kind of party is it?

Cocktail party? A Tupperware party?

Is it a surprise party?

Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party.

'Cause according to the man on the radio,
a west coast party don't stop.

I'm sorry I mentioned it.

Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up,
I knock them down,

that's called teamwork.

(GASPS)

That's a kick, that's an actual kick.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

What are you doing?

I felt a kick.

There's a baby in there.

Oh, yeah. That's where I put it.

(CHUCKLES) No, I mean,
I know you're pregnant.

I just never connected
the idea of pregnancy

and you actually having a baby.

Which MIT did you go to?

(CHUCKLES)

Oh, God, we are not ready to have
an infant in this house.

We don't have a crib.
We don't have diapers.

We're not baby-proofed.

Anyone can just walk in off the street
and lift our toilet lids.

Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.

Do we? Look at you.

Willy Wonka would roll you
to the juicing room.

The next person kicking you will be me,
good night.

(SIGHS)

Are we even in a good school-- Ow!

I warned you and I did it.

What's all this?

Oh, everything we need for
your autograph session.

Headshots, markers.

Okay, Leonard,
it's sweet you're excited about this,

but it'll be a miracle
if one person asks for my autograph.

Are you kidding? I once paid $20
for Theo Sassler's signature.

Who's that?

I don't even know. ljust liked his name.
Theo Sassler.

Oh, and look at this,
I even got a change maker.

(BLOWS)

How much change you want, little lady?

Oh, there's so much I want to change.

Yeah, well, if it's a dollar,
you're in luck.

What's going on here?

You expressed an interest
in having people over

and I feel I dismissed it too quickly.

So, I took matters into my own hands
and I arranged a brunch.

That's so nice, who's coming?

Oh, uh, Stuart,
uh, Bert from the geology lab

and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

You mean the Romanian lady
on the second floor?

Yes. Oh, fun story.

She grew up with 10 siblings

or possibly penguins,
her English is atrocious.

That's an odd mix of people.

Well, for our first time hosting

I thought it would be wise
to conduct a trial run.

You know, like how I practiced
for that Halloween haunted house

by going into the bathroom
at the bus station.

But you never went into that
haunted house.

You never saw what jumped out at me
at the bus station.

Well, thank you, Sheldon,
this is a fun surprise.

Aw, well, the real surprise
is how surprised

you are that I'm great at surprises.

Well, that's not a surprise at all.

I mean, if I knew you were good
at surprises,

I would've expected the surprise
and therefore not have been surprised.

But as it is I didn't know and therefore
my surprise should be unsurprising.

Don't get me all randy,
guests are on the way.

- Hi.
- Hey, where you been?

We went and did a little shopping
for the baby.

Wait till you see the crib we found.

You bought a crib without me?

- You're gonna love it.
- Yeah.

It's the highest rated one on the market.
I wouldn't even call it a crib.

I'd call it a
"Fortress of Solitude for babies."

Sounds expensive.

Okay, well,
I may have gone a bit overboard,

but you can't put a price on safety.

Though if you did, it's more zeroes
than you're expecting.

But it's the safest crib you can buy.

- If you don't like it we can return it.
- Fine.

In our new minivan, hey what's for lunch?

You bought a minivan?

It's for the baby. And I didn't buy it.

The dealer loaned to me for
a 24-hour test-drive.

Though we did ding up the back pretty
good with the crib,

so you might've bought a minivan.

I don't wanna drive that,
it's such a mom car.

The guy at the dealership said
they're not just for moms anymore.

Then again, he did think you were
my husband.

They thought it at the ultrasound,
why not at the car dealership?

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Never been on this side
of the table before.

Feel powerful.

Really?

Feel like I'm selling candy
so our team can get new uniforms.

Okay, so it's $4.75
for a signed black and white

and $9.95 for color.

All right. Why not five and 10 bucks?

I brought my moneymaker, let me shake it.

Hey, that guy's looking over here.

Oh, think he's your first autograph?

I don't know. Be cool.
He's coming. He's coming.

Hi.

- Hi. I love your movie.
- Oh, thanks.

It has got to be one of the worst things
I've ever seen in my life.

Your love confuses me.

- Would you like an autograph?
- Sure.

- Okay, who do I make it out to?
- Daniel.

- Okay.
- I have to ask,

were you trying to be that bad
or are you just a terrible actress?

That did not clear things up.

That'll be $4.75.

- Keep the change.
- But, I-- Oh.

- Nothing about that was good.
- Mmm-mmm.

There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.

(GRUNTS)

The average cork speed
is 25 miles per hour.

If that is too fast around a school,
it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.

Been 15 minutes, just sayin'.

Oh, gosh. I can do this.
Just give me a moment--

-(CORK POPS)
- Mommy! (GASPS)

Mimosas coming up.

I once left orange juice in my fridge
so long it tasted like a mimosa.

How old was it?

It's hard to say.

I don't remember much after I drank it.

- Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
- Yes.

Drink is fun and good friends...

Applebee's.

She's learning English from TV.

TV, good. Now back to you.

- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Stuart.

- These are for you.
- Oh, they're pretty. Thank you.

Stuart, this is Bert
from the Caltech geology lab

and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.

- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

- Hey.
- So, what did I miss?

Yeah, we watched Sheldon try to open
a bottle for 15 minutes.

Fifteen minutes can save you fifteen
percent or more on car insurance.

Anybody else coming to this thing?

- What's your name? Okay.
- Jeff.

My favorite part is your shower scene.

Been hearing that a lot today.

I even have a screen grab on my phone.

Yep, there they are.

- Okay, let's keep it moving.
- Here you go.

Should have punched that guy.

Oh. Go ahead. He's right over there.

Why do you do that?
Can't you let me have my moment?

- Hello.
- Hi, I like your movies.

- Thank you.
- I saw both of them.

I assume we're still talking about the
movies, but after today, who knows.

- You think I could get a picture of us?
- Oh, sure.

And, could you be giving me a kiss?

No. She cannot--
What is wrong with you people?

- Leonard.
- No, no, no. It's not okay.

- Who are you?
-l'm her husband.

(LAUGHS) No you're not.

- I am.
- Yeah. He really is.

No.

It's got a rear-view camera,
there's a DVD player.

And check this out...

It's like we're living in the future!

Hey, show her the trunk.
Show her the trunk.

Imagine this.

You've got the baby in one hand,

groceries in the other,
and you're thinking,

"How am I gonna open this trunk?"

I'm probably thinking, "Where's my husband
and why isn't he helping me?"

You don't need my help

when you can open the trunk
with a simple kick of the foot.

No. It's a gentle kick,
you're doing it wrong.

Here, give me those.

You know, maybe it was more of a circle...

It's weird that guy thought
you were a couple.

'Yes!
'Yes!

See? Easy.

Look at all this cargo space.

You know, we'll get the crib out
and you can take it for a test drive.

I'm telling you this,
hang on, is gonna be--

(YELPING)

Oh, is it your back?

Yeah.

(GROANING)

Anyway, let's just get in and see if the

GPS can take us to the nearest
emergency room.

So, until Amy's apartment is fixed,
she and I are living here together.

I lived with my old girlfriend.

She was a geologist, too.

Things didn't work out?

I came home from work one day
and she had taken everything.

I'm warning you.

Hide your good rocks.

My sister's husband
took all her things too.

Story at 11:00.

Really, no one else is coming?

This is it. You are the practice round.

Practice round? For what?

No. He just means that you were
the first people we thought of.

No, exactly.

We've never thrown a brunch before
and I wanted to work out all the kinks.

So, I'm like a lab rat
before your real friends come over?

Mmm.

You see, your words sound reasonable
but your face looks angry.

Help me out, here.
This is not where I shine.

Stuart, you know you're one of
our favorite people.

Okay. Now, see you look sincere
but your words are completely false.

I'm glad we did the test run.
These brunches are wild.

But how did you get her
to go out with you?

Well, she moved in across the hall.

And he started to slowly wear me down.

Like a river carves a canyon.

Yeah. Except the river
kept showing me his PokÃ©mon cards.

Ready to go?

Hang on. This guy's telling me how he got
the Serial <i>Ape-ist</i> girl to marry him.

This guy?

But he's wearing a change maker.

I think it's hot.

That's right.

I'm her change-daddy.

(GROANING)

What was I thinking?

Wolowitz's are not a lifting people.

We tip the lifting people.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Do we really have to sit for hours
in the emergency room?

They're just gonna give you ice
and Advil like last time.

You're gonna feel terrible
when I'm in a wheelchair.

Which, by the way, would fit easily in the
back of this award-winning minivan.

Fine. We'll go to the ER.
Just stop selling me on the van.

You're right. It sells itself.

You have to admit,
it is a pretty smooth ride.

I was hoping it'd be quieter.

If child birth is half this bad
you are so screwed!

- Are we there yet?
- Soon.

Why is it taking so long?

Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen.

<i>I've put on Batman The Animated Series.</i>
Your <i>favorite.</i>

-I'm in too much pain to watch...
-(BATMAN THEME SONG PLAYING)

Oh, this is a good one.

I've been babysitting him way longer
than you have.

Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.

This is the best blintz I've ever had.

Oh, thank you.

It almost makes up for the incredibly
awkward turn things took earlier.

You know what, I think I'm just gonna go.

No, Stuart. Don't.

You know, I consider you
and Sheldon like my family

and I'm not even sure
you think of me as a friend.

You have any idea how that feels?

We're so sorry.

You know, I'm always the last one
anybody thinks of.

Well, that's not true.

Sometimes it's Koothrappali.

Although we're not supposed to say
that 'cause he's a minority.

- Bye.
- No, Stuart. Wait.

I do know what it feels like
to be left out.

I know how it feels, too.

All right. This is about me and him,
you're not a part of it.

Stuart,

perhaps we do take you for granted
and that is not acceptable.

Please know that you truly are
a valuable member of our social group.

- Thank you.
- You know, in fact.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To Stuart.

A fine man, a good friend

and a wonderful guest.

- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

Cheers.
Filmed before a live studio audience.

And that is how a short,
asthmatic scientist

landed a stone cold fox.

ALL: Whoa!

I didn't know you could propose
to the same person

so many times.

The third time, I did it in sky writing
but she never looked up.

- You know, once I proposed to him.
- Yeah. I said no.

- Why?
- Wanted to make her work for it.

Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.

Hang on.
ls she just with you because you're rich?

She makes more money than I do!

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Who are you?

Do you know
what else I love about you, hmm?

Your handwriting is impeccable.

- Thank you for noticing!
- No, I mean it, I mean it.

It's like you have the soul
of a label maker.

You know what I love about you?

You never leave the house
without a paperclip.

'Cause you never know when two pieces
of paper might temporarily need fastening

in the top-left corner.

I also love how you never use swear words.

You know, it turns out

you can hurt people just as well
without 'em.

Maybe I can get a little help putting
some of this stuff away.

Oh... (STAMMERS) Calm down.

I already put away five of these.

You see?
No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.

English - SDH

Hello, I'm Doctor Sheldon Cooper.

And I'm Doctor Amy Farrah Fowler.

And welcome to the first
on-location episode

of Doctor Sheldon Cooper and
Doctor Amy Farrah Fowler present...

BOTH: <i>Doctor Sheldon Cooper's
Fun with Flags.</i>

Hit it.

<i>(SINGING) For joy and fun
there's no better manner</i>

<i>Than to fly a pennant
flag or banner</i>

<i>What fills my heart
and makes my eyes moist</i>

<i>Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist</i>

<i>Fun with flags
Fun with flags</i>

<i>Oh! Say can you see</i>

<i>It's fun with flags</i>

<i>Fun with flags</i>

As you may notice,

just one of the changes around
here is our new house band.

(PLAYING)

Who haven't learned their place yet.

We're also coming to you live
from a different apartment.

Doctor Fowler and I began an
experiment in living together

after her apartment
became water damaged.

This is our friend Penny's place.

You may remember her
from our episode,

<i>Flags, and the People
Who Don't Understand Them.</i>

So, in the spirit of cohabitation,

the theme of today's episode

is flags of two regions
coming together as one.

Such as the flag
of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

So let's roll up our "sleeves"
and get to know "Nevis."

(PLAYS RIMSHOT)

I like that,
but next time check with me.

<i>Did you know, that the flag</i>

<i>was designed by
a student named Edrice Lewis...</i>

I can't believe I'm saying this,

but can we watch the news
or something?

It's cute, they're
having fun living together.

Yeah, I wonder what they're
gonna do when her apartment's ready.

- Actually, it's been ready for weeks.
- What do you mean?

Well, they finished the work early,

but she's been telling Sheldon
they're behind schedule.

- So, she's just been lying to him?
- Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

Yeah, but to make him leave,
not to make him stay.

Buda and Pest
united to form Budapest.

And that's why Budapest
is the "Buda-best."

- Now.
- Sorry!

(PLAYS RIMSHOT)

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Thank you for
your services, gentlemen.

I'm hoping to broaden our audience

with your youthful rock 'n' roll music.

Aw, you think you have an audience,
that's funny!

We don't get paid? Nothing?
Not even a sandwich?

It's almost dinner time,
you in the mood for anything?

You know, we could get
Thai food near your apartment

and then drop in
and check on the progress.

Oh, you don't wanna do that,
it's a construction zone.

So?

Well, what about your fear
of stray nails and butt cracks?

I am terrified of stepping on a nail
and falling into a butt crack.

Anyway, how about dinner?

You know, if you'd like, I could
call your landlord and complain.

Thanks, but you don't have to.

Oh, I don't mind,
I'm very good at complaining.

Yeah. If it were an Olympic sport,

I'd complain about
what a stupid sport it is

and then I'd take home the gold.

Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?

Is it me or are you purposely
changing the subject?

No.

And on the subject of subjects,
is your use of the word "subject"

the same or different as when
we speak about the subject of a king?

I have a feeling
you're still doing it.

But I find that topic irresistible so,

now in ancient Mesopotamia,

the King referred
to the people as his property.

I'm serious,
JPL's actually developing a robot arm

that could grab
an asteroid before it hits us.

So their plan for saving
the Earth from Armageddon

is hoping a bunch of
scientists can catch a ball?

If we're all gonna die,
why am I eating so much kale?

You're awful quiet, everything okay?

I'm concerned about Amy.
She's acting a bit odd, lately.

Just out of curiosity
what registers as "odd" to you?

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Her behavior.

Now, I have the feeling
that she's hiding something.

I wouldn't worry about it,
she's probably distracted by work.

Well, whatever it is,
it's troubling me.

I can't eat, I can't sleep,

and don't even ask about the
consistency of my bowel movements.

You heard him, guys, don't ask.

Why would she keep something from me?

You know,
I shared my body with that woman.

And my Netflix password!

<i>They recommended
Stella Got Her Groove Back</i>

because of her.

Buddy, but, listen.
Nothing bad is going on, she just...

She just didn't want you to know
that the work on her apartment

was finished a couple weeks ago.

I don't understand.

She's enjoying living with you
and she didn't want it to end early.

So, she's deceiving me in order
to spend more time with me.

- Yes.
-(SIGHS)

Well, I feel both
flattered and hurt, you know?

Like when people say
I look like that skeleton

<i>from Nightmare Before Christmas.</i>

Oh, my God, that's who you look like!

Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

It's a little white lie,
everyone does it.

Not me, I'm 100% honest
in all of my relationships.

And how single are you right now?

Eating cake on the toilet single.

Well, I won't tolerate
deception in my relationship.

Now I have no choice
but to confront her.

Don't do that, you've got gold here.

Hang onto it until you're in trouble
and then throw it in her face.

Why would you tell him that?
That's terrible advice.

So you wouldn't want
to have anything on Penny?

Well, of course not.

So, if I actually know
something right now, and I do,

you don't want me to tell you?

- Uh... (SCOFFS) No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

She's secretly been moving
your collectibles into storage

a little at a time
and you haven't noticed.

Are you kidding me?

See? I've known
that for weeks, but, you know,

I waited till the moment when
it would cause him the most pain.

Superman's gone,
my Stormtrooper's gone?

Your Klingon
word-of-the-day calendar's gone.

(GROANS) I'd say "damn it" in Klingon
but that wasn't until next month.

<i>- It's "khoo-vakh. "
-"Khoo-vakh. "</i>

She took my Where's Waldo!

- Well, no, no, he's overthere.
- Oh, yeah, there he is.

So, what's the deal
with your apartment?

Why is it taking so long?

Uh, it was a drywall problem.

Oh, no. What happened?

Well, the drywall got wet
and you do not want wet drywall

because when drywall
gets wet it's really more...

Wet wall?

- Or damp wall! Just as bad.
- Mmm.

So why don't
they just get more drywall?

Well, they went to get some

but the woman at the wall store

said it was going on sale
and they should wait

-because the savings of the--
- Okay, are you done?

Bernadette told me
your apartment's ready.

(SIGHS) I was done at wet wall
but you wouldn't let it go.

Is Sheldon really believing all this crap?

(SIGHS) Well, he started to question it,
but then I fake sneezed on him

and he ran to take a shower.

Please don't say anything,
I feel terrible about this.

- Oh, don't worry, I won't.
- Thanks.

- The woman at the wall store?
- Let it go!

Are you going to confront Penny?

Eventually, I guess.

Although, I am kind of curious
how long she thinks

she can keep hiding
my stuff without me knowing.

Mmm.

You know, perhaps
instead of confronting them,

we should see how far they're
willing to spin their tangled webs.

Like that Spider-Man action figure
that used to be on your desk.

Oh, my God. I'm going blind!

- Hi.
- Food's here.

Excellent. I'm very hungry.

Speaking of which,
what's going on with your apartment?

- Oh. Uh, they're still working on it.
- Interesting. Very interesting.

Yeah, we swung by her apartment
on the way to the restaurant.

They're gonna be
fixing it for a while.

Wait, you saw her apartment?

I did. Still a mess.

- Leonard?
- Yeah?

(SPEAKS KLINGON)

Why are you speaking Klingon?

Why are you speaking English?

This is ridiculous.

Penny, do you remember
when I taught you Ubbi-dubbi?

(SPEAKS UBBI-DUBBI)

- All right, stop that!
- You stop that!

(SPEAKS KLINGON)

Okay. That's enough.
You know what?

What is going on?

Fine, I told Sheldon that
her apartment's been finished,

and you said
it's not so now I'm all confused.

Penny was just covering for me.

My place has been
ready for two weeks.

How could you lie to me?

She's enjoyed living with you.
It's called being in love.

And what's it called
when you secretly

get rid of all your husband's stuff?

That is not true!

Bernadette told Howard,
Howard told me.

Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!

Oh. So you believe your friend

and your friend's wife
and your own eyes over me?

Wow.

You really didn't think
I'd notice my stuff was missing?

Uh, did you notice your key chain?

Where's Batman?

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Hey.

Why did you tell Howard
I was hiding Leonard's things?

One sec.

Why did you tell Leonard I told you
Penny was hiding his things?

It just came up because we were talking
about secrets and, wait--

(SPEAKS KLINGON)

Yeah, would you stop it with that!

I'm not really a part of this,
so I'm just gonna dig in.

And I'd like to know why you
blabbed about my apartment?

You're up, blabby. (CHUCKLES)

Amy, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything.

I guess it's okay.

I'm sorry
that I lied about my apartment.

- It's all right.
- And?

And, what?
Your wizard robes are next to go.

Now that everything's out on the table,

you think you two
will keep living together?

Despite recent events,

I do consider our experiment in
cohabitation to have been positive.

Are you saying
you'd like to live with me?

I'm open to the possibility.

(SPEAKS UBBI-DUBBI)

(IN ENGLISH) Whatever.

You know, if he moves
across the hall for good,

Leonard could keep the stuff
you don't like in Sheldon's old room.

- Solves everything.
- That's a great idea!

Ooh, maybe,
I could turn it into a gaming den.

- That would be amazing.
- Well, hold, hold on.

Excuse me, that's my room.

But you won't be living here.

- But that's my room.
- But you won't be living here.

- But that's my room.
- You guys may want to start eating.

But you won't be living here.

Sweetie, once you stop paying rent,
none of this is really yours.

- But that's my room.
- ALL: But you won't be living here.

Thank you for understanding.

Hey, I get it.

Everybody wants
to spend more time with me.

I'm like a man
made of sugar in a world of ants.

- Good night.
-'Night.

If we did continue living together,
would it be here?

I don't know. It could be.

Of course there's,
there's always your apartment.

Sure, sure,
we could live in my apartment.

I hate your apartment.

Sorry you brought it up?

Well, I suppose
we could find a whole new place.

You know, and technically we don't
even have to stay in Pasadena.

You know, we could move to Altadena,

or a place that
doesn't even end in "dena."

It's kind of exciting, I mean,

we could do whatever we want.

But what if we move
and we don't like it?

What if there's a smoker
in the building? Or pets?

Or, there could be mold.
There could be traffic noise.

I'm gonna have to learn
a whole new bus route.

(SCATTING STAR <i>TREK</i> THEME)

Are you trying to soothe me

by singing the
Star Trek theme as a lullaby?

- Yes.
-l'm not a child, don't do that.

Sorry.

<i>Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey?</i>

(SCATTING 2001.' <i>A SPACE ODYSSEY </i>THEME)

All right, now that's soothing.

(CONTINUES SCATTING)

Look, I get it. It's still my room.

- We haven't really made it yours.
- Thank you.

Which is why I got you
this Pink Power Ranger.

Put it anywhere you like.

Okay, but you may
feel some discomfort.

I'm kidding,
I want you to feel at home here.

Decorate it any way
that makes you happy.

- Do you really mean that?
- I really do.

Great. And just so you know,
I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.

Yeah? What are you keeping?

That candle and you.

- What about my robot poster?
- I can make do with just the candle.

(SHELDON BREATHING HEAVILY)

What's going on?

I'm struggling with the thought
of leaving my old bedroom.

(SIGHS) Can it be more of
an internal struggle?

I need to see it.

While I'm gone,
don't breathe on my pillow.

How about if
I just don't breathe at all?

That's my girl.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

What on Earth?

What is going on?

Oh. Hey, Sheldon!

We turned your room
into a sex dungeon! Oh!

-(SCREAMS) No!
- What is it?

Okay, last question.
The chaps he was wearing, assless?

Can we just focus
on the decision I'm facing?

We can. But for the record,
all chaps are assless.

Gentlemen, please!
This is a significant decision.

Now, do Amy and I
continue living together

or do I move back in with Leonard?

Over my assless chaps, you will.

This isn't complicated.

- Do you love Amy?
- Yes.

- Do you like living with her?
- Yes.

Do you know what you need to do now?

Apparently figure this out on my own
'cause you guys are no help at all.

Hi.

Hello.

What are you doing?

I'm just contemplating
Buridan's donkey.

I understand. I'll leave you be.

What?
You're familiar with the reference?

Of course.

Jean Buridan proposed
a philosophical thesis stating

that a hungry donkey placed between
two equidistant bales of hay

would be paralyzed by indecision
and would starve to death.

Exactly.

I wouldn't want you
to starve to death, so,

here's an eggplant.

Thank you.

You know, some people believe that
Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.

Really?

Although, in Aristotle's example

he proposed an equally hungry
and thirsty man

caught between food and drink.

Oh. Yeah, I wonder if that's
related to the 12th-century

Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali

and his story of a man
caught between two dates.

Are you suggesting
Al-Ghazali was an Aristotelian?

'Cause if anything,
he was anti-Aristotelian.

Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?

Boy! You think you know a guy.

Okay, open your eyes
and see your new room.

Wow.

I know I went a little overboard.
We can always dial it back.

<i>No</i>, no! <i>No</i>, no, no!

It's important to me that
you have the bedroom you want.

- Oh, that means so much. I love you.
- I love you, too.

Just hiding some stuff
in your closet, don't tell Penny.

English - SDH

How much will it hurt?

It's just a tiny skin sample.
You saw me do it to myself.

On a scale of one to 10,
where "one" is a pebble in your shoe

and "10" is the monkey you thought
was your pet biting your face off.

- A two.
- Eating a whole Altoid?

Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize
a neural network from our skin cells,

I need to harvest them.

Now, I've done this dozens of times,

but if you're too scared
you don't have to.

No, this is for science.
I can be brave for science.

Thank you.

(GASPS) Oh, Jiminy! That's cold!

Just think how happy you'll be
in a few weeks

when I've converted our skin cells
into functional brain cells.

All right, just warn me before you do it.

Okay.

Three, two, and we're done.

You tricked me!

Well, you didn't say "one".

Well, it didn't hurt, did it?

No, but "three, two, and we're done"
is incomplete.

You know those things bother me.

It's like hearing "da-da-da-da duh-dah"
without yelling...

- Okay, fine. One.
- Thank you.

Now yell "charge,"
and we can get out of here.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(MUNCHING)

Oh, my God! ljust got it.

"Fun onions." Funyuns!

(CHUCKLES)

Hold on. ls that a wobble?

Yes. That's definitely
a gravitational wobble.

Uh, sorry, I could come back.

Oh, no. It's okay, ljust found a wobble.

Oh, do I need a mop?

It's a gravitational wobble.

It could be a sign of an
extra-solar planet that may contain life

and someday be named after me.

Oh. Well, if it has life,
maybe it already has a name, huh?

Yeah, but it's probably difficult
to pronounce.

- What is your name?
- Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

You think it would be more difficult
than that?

Good point. (CHUCKLES) And you are?

Oh, uh, lssabella Maria Concepcion.

- Oh. Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

You know, I have to say,
based on the candy wrappers

and the bags of junk food
I see in this trash,

I thought the person working here
was 10 years old.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, please,
show me a 10-year-old

who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

<i>Bueno.</i> Um, I'm just going to empty
your wastepaper basket

and then I'll get out of your way.

Oh, please, allow me.

That's a lot of empty calories.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Okay, uh, okay.

I have to go. Good luck with your,
um, space exploration.

(CHUCKLES) Thank you.
Good luck with your future endeavors.

Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?

If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.

Oh, just let me look.

(GASPS) Oh, my goodness.

I see quivering black lines,
those must be neurons.

Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.

Those are your eyelashes. Move!

Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes.

Our combined skin cells are now
a primitive neural network.

I have such a profound sense of creation.

It's like when I hatched sea monkeys,

except that this is from my DNA,
so this is like me-monkeys.

These cells come from both of us.

Yeah, but "us-monkeys" doesn't pop.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!
"We-monkeys," there you go.

Hey, when can we start
running tests on it?

No reason we can't start right now.

What stimulus
should we introduce it to first?

Light, sound, temperature?

(EXCITEDLY) Oh, oh! Let's expose it
to images of me and you,

and see who it likes better.

Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection
of neurons.

It's remarkable,
but it's still limited in what it can do.

I understand.

She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.

Huh. They screwed up and gave us
steamed broccoli.

- Oh, no, that's mine.
- Really?

Last green thing I saw you eat
was a skittle.

Well, I can't eat like a 10-year-old
all the time.

You're dating somebody. Who is it?

What? What are you talking about?

You only watch what you eat
when you're afraid

you might have to take your shirt off.

Well, she's right.
As long as I've known you

you've always been self-conscious
about your cleavage.

That's because you keep trying to stick
pencils in it.

All right, fine, don't tell us.

There's nothing to tell.

All right.

How's that broccoli?

It's gross, but I have to eat it.
Because I met somebody.

Barn! Thank you! What's her name?

- Issabella.
- Oh.

Did you meet her at work?

Yes, in the telescope room.

So, she's an astronomer.

Yes. Which is why
she was in the telescope room.

Yes, this is all making sense, good.

Well, that's great, Raj.
You must have so much in common.

Mmm-hmm.

So, when do we meet her?

No, no, this is brand new.
We haven't even been on a proper date yet.

- Okay, well, good luck with it.
- Thank you.

How come you never eat broccoli?

I'm married,
I don't have to be attractive.

You know, most people don't realize

this technique has actually been around
for a few years.

Still, I can't believe
you can turn ordinary skin cells

into functioning brain cells.

Well, I turned this one
into a functioning boyfriend,

so sky's the limit.

Look, look, here I am
standing next to the incubator.

And here is a microscopic view
of the cells.

Look at that. Put 'em in
a tiny Flash T-shirt, and it's you.

This little guy can already recognize
electronically transmitted images

20% faster than any other sample
in Amy's lab.

I'm running out of ways to act excited.

So, enough about us.
How are things going with you?

Great. The doctor said
the baby's head is facing down now.

Good, you know, in case
the exit isn't clearly marked, it's...

You know, I have to say,
it is nice to share this experience

with someone who's on the same journey,
you know?

Although, right now,
ours is testing off the charts

while yours is floating around
in its own waste.

Are you actually comparing my human baby
to your brain in a bowl?

Well, I didn't make you waddle up
four flights of stairs for the heck of it.

You do realize my baby has functioning
organs and can recognize voices.

Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific
data stream among background noise.

Mine has a fully developed immune system.

Ours doesn't need an immune system

because it lives in a state-of-the-art
German incubator.

Sheldon, that's enough.

Oh, well, you know what? Fine.

Let's just agree that both creations
are special in their own way,

and it is foolish to try and compare them.

Although, we didn't need to have sex
with Howard for ours, so we win.

This is fun!

Hey, I've never cleaned a toilet before.

You're kidding.

No, I grew up
with a house full of servants

and now I have a cleaning lady,

who is a lovely woman
who I have great respect for.

It's okay,
you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.

Oh, good, because she also walks my dog,
buys my groceries, and cuts my hair.

I think that's called a mommy.

Uh...

So, forgive me,
forgive me for being nosey,

but is there a wedding ring
under those pretty rubber gloves?

Oh.

No. Not for many years.

Oh, so you are unencumbered?

Just me and my son.

I love kids! How old is he?

Nineteen.

That's a cute age.

They can do so many things.

He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.

That's wonderful. A lawyer.
My sister's a lawyer.

Look at that, we have something in common.

Yeah, I guess we do.

Maybe there are other things
we have in common.

Like, come dinnertime,
do you enjoy eating food?

AV, Rajesh.

I think you're very sweet, but
(SIGHS) I work two jobs,

and I don't have time for dating.

Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

Oh, please, don't take it personal,
I think you're a very nice man.

I think you're very nice as well.

Thank you for helping me.
Good night, Rajesh.

Oh, yes. Oh, Okay.

Uh, good night.

I don't know, maybe it's the fumes
from the urinal cakes,

but I feel like something is happening
between us.

(CHUCKLES) Good night, Rajesh.

Okay, I'll leave, but just know,
every time I come in here

I'll be thinking of you.

Would you look at that?
The image we gave it was 45% white noise,

and it still managed to reconstruct it.

I've never seen results like this before.

Yeah, we need to stop for magnets
on the way home.

This is going right on the fridge.

Aren't you glad you participated in this?

Oh, I am.
And you realize what the next step is.

(SIGHS) Set up a second culture
and try to replicate our results.

Uh, no. We lock that door,
lower our underpants a little,

and make a baby.

"Make a baby"? What are you talking about?

Clearly, the combination of our DNA
is exceptional.

(STAMMERS) Our child could be
the next step in the evolution of mankind.

We'll be able to get
into any preschool we want.

Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.

Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle.

Hmm?

Yeah, for the next 36 hours,

you're as fertile
as a manure-covered wheat field.

Wow. I can actually feel the egg
crawling its way back up.

I don't understand.

Well, I thought you'd be thrilled
to procreate with me.

Not right now.

Oh, I see what's happening here.

You're playing hard to get.

I'm not playing anything.
We're not making a baby today.

(SIGHS) Very well.

Oops. How clumsy of me. You know what?
Let me get that.

Hey...

Where are you going? I--

Did you even look at my bottom?

Welcome.

(CHUCKLING) What is this?

Oh. Well, you said you didn't have time
to go out for dinner,

so I thought we could have one right here.

- Oh, Rajesh--
- Come on, we're in the telescope room.

It'll be like dining under the stars.

You see this double zero? When it says
"01", that means it's twinkling.

Sometimes it takes a while.

Rajesh, this is so sweet,
but you know I'm working.

That's why I already cleaned up in here
and all the other rooms in the hall.

(SIGHS)

Well, I suppose that gives me
a little time.

Please, sit.

I tried to cook you a meal
from your homeland.

Oh, really? You made Cuban food?

That depends.
Do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

Now, when he said "make a baby",
is it possible he meant out of Legos?

No, he was explicit.
Needlessly and freakishly explicit.

LEONARD: Why does he need a baby?

He's already hairless
and smells like talcum powder.

Could you two really have
some sort of super-intelligent child?

Well, there is a genetic component,
but that doesn't guarantee anything.

That's true. Sheldon's father
once picked a fight with a cactus.

Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.

We don't know anything
about the ones that sent him here.

LEONARD: Well, you know,
they were smart enough to send him away.

Hey, you're talking about
the person I love

and have been avoiding
for the past three hours.

Oh, man!

Ooh! ls Sheldon gonna get some!

Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's
behind door number two.

(SMOOTH-JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, hello.

Hello.

Would you care for a brandy?

I don't think so.

Good choice, it's disgusting.

Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.

Who's trying to seduce you?

After a long day,
I always turn on smooth jazz

and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.

I thought it smelled
like a petting zoo in here.

Anything you'd like to pet?
(STUTTERS) But not my hair.

There's a lot of goop in it.

- Okay, I've had enough.
-(STAMMERS)

Amy, come back!

I don't know how to open the oysters.

So, um, what surprised you the most
when you first came to America?

Well, I suppose how much people care
about Oprah's favorite things.

I thought that, too.

But then I got my first waffle-maker
and never questioned her again.

You know, I do have
some time off this Sunday.

If you'd like, we--

Hey, I saw your car--
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

<i>- Uh ___</i>
- It's okay, I should get back to work!

- Hi! Howard Wolowitz.
- Oh, lssabella Concepcion.

Oh, yeah, the astronomer.
Raj told us about you.

Hey! Free toilet paper!

You told him I was an astronomer?

Uh...

I understand, time to go.

No, please don't!

It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman.

I don't have to waste my time with someone
who's embarrassed by me.

I can keep this, right?

Issabella!

Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.

If you are embarrassed by what I do,
why did you pursue me?

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

Honestly, I didn't think
your job would bother me,

but I guess it did,
and I hate myself for that.

But there's a lot of things about me
that would totally embarrass you.

I doubt that.

Well, prepare to be mortified.

I let my dog eat food out of my mouth
not because she likes it,

but because I do.

Also, I know they're pretty,
but I'm scared of butterflies.

Sorry, just passing through.

I think this fell off your cart.
(CHUCKLES)

Come on, what do you say?
Let me make it up to you.

You're very persistent.

It's my one move.

Okay.

This Sunday night, you may take me
to dinner at a nice restaurant.

Great, where would you like to go?

Your choice.
It can be Pakistani food if you like.

- Excuse me, but I'm Indian.
- And now you know how it feels.

So, were you turned on even a little bit?

It was like being hit on
by Rat Pack Pee-Wee Herman.

- L'm sorry, is that a yes?
- No!

Amy, I didn't want it to come to this.

But you have left me no choice

but to employ the most passionate,
seductive dance known to man.

(FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYING)

- The flamenco.
-(SNAPS FINGERS)

For God's sake, you're ridiculous.

(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

Well, you guys are aroused, right?

(PANTING)

That was a close one.

English - SDH

Thank you very much, thanks. I was just...

LEONARD: That is unbelievable,
good for Bert.

Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.

Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

Everything is stupid and I wanna go home.

That's Sheldon's way of saying
he's proud of Bert, too.

You know, it's not even called
the "Genius Grant,"

it's the MacArthur Fellowship.

Just like it's not Frankenstein,
it's "Frankenstein's Monster."

Which brings us back to
that hulking simpleton over there.

And if anyone's a genius, it's me
for the way I brought that full circle!

- How much money did he win? Wow!
- Over half a million dollars.

And he doesn't have to use it
for research,

-he can do whatever he wants with it.
- Oh, good.

Maybe he can build a nicer bridge
to live under.

- Here he comes.
- Right. Be polite.

- I know how to behave.
- Do you?

RAJ: Hey, congratulations, Bert.
LEONARD: Yeah, good for you.

Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody.

When they called and told me I won,
I didn't believe them.

And then they said, "No, you really won,"
and then I said, "Cool."

Someone call George R. R. Martin,
this guy knows how to finish a story.

Gotten pretty good at telling it.

Well, see ya.

Some "genius," I zinged him with sarcasm
and he didn't even notice.

I know, and it was the greatest
sarcastic quip I've ever heard.

Well, aren't you a peach.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(GROANS)
Who leaves their bike in the hallway?

You know, if I knew how to ride one
I'd steal it.

(PENNY SCOFFS)

Ignore him, he's just cranky
because Bert from the geology lab

won a big grant.

Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio!
You know, when they told him he won,

he didn't believe it, but then
he did believe it. It was so funny.

SHELDON: Who listens to the radio anymore?

Bert is studying
the way microbes in rocks

can survive
in extreme environmental conditions.

Hmm, they say it could be a potential
indicator of life on other planets.

No, I have met Bert, isn't he an indicator
of life on other planets?

(LEONARD AND PENNY CHUCKLE)

SHELDON: You used to make
those jokes about me.

Now everything is "Bert, Bert, Bert."

AMY: You know, Sheldon, maybe if you took
the time to read Bert's research,

you'd be less bitter about him winning.

(STUTTERS)
You want me to read a geology paper?

Honestly, ljust want you to be quiet,
but I'm all out of taffy.

(KNOCKING)

You busy? There's somebody out here
who wants to meet you.

- Who is it?
- Say hello to everybody's little friend,

remote-control Stephen Hawking!

(CHUCKLES)

- Where did you get that?
- I found him in an old box. (CHUCKLES)

Why would you buy it?

I didn't buy it, I made it.

Last question. What is wrong with you?

- What's the big deal?
- Howie, it's in poor taste.

No, it's not.
Check it out, he says fun stuff.

<i>(IN SPEECH SYNTHESIZER VOICE)
Hey, good lookin', want to go fora spin?</i>

His eyes also light up in the dark.
(LAUGHS)

It's always fun
watching him read someone else's work.

(SCOFFS)

(GROANS)

It's like scrolling through the emojis
on my phone.

<i>Why'?</i>

(GRUNTS) Why?

Oh, that's why.

Sounds like the night we had coitus.

I hope you're happy making me read this.

Bert's work is remarkable
and I'm more upset than ever.

This is worse than
when I had to admit that

Cedric the Entertainer's
actually entertaining.

Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry
that Bert's work has merit.

Yeah, well, lam angry!

And you telling me not to be angry
makes me angry!

And do you know how hearing myself
say the word "angry" over and over

-makes me feel?
- Ooh! Angry?

- What are you doing?
- I'm__

(STUTTERS) I knew the answer,
I got excited. (CLEARS THROAT)

Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk
so you can calm down?

(SIGHS) That's a good idea.
I guess, everyone's having them now.

Hey, I'm trying to help you.

Fine, you can walk ahead of me
and scare off the pigeons.

You just wave your arms a little
and they fly away, it's not...

Okay, Raj, I'm gonna show you something.

Now, one of us thinks it's offensive,

the other thinks it's hilarious
and a great idea.

But I'm not going to tell you
who likes it.

This is tough.

But, I'm going to say it's the guy
who shows me YouTube videos

of people getting hit in the nuts.

(CHUCKLES)

You're crazy.

I've worked with Hawking, he's got a great
sense of humor and I think he'd like it.

Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.

I have no problem calling him.

- Fine, then do it.
- Fine, l will.

While you're bothering
the world's most famous scientist,

be sure to show him how funny he looks
getting stuck under our dishwasher.

What's this button do?

<i>(IN SPEECH SYNTHESIZER VOICE)
Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.</i>

(ENGINE REVVING)

(LINE RINGING)

You laughed
when that guy got hit in the nuts.

I laughed because the guy was Leonard.

- I admire you, Leonard.
- Really? Why?

You're happy with who you are.
You don't get jealous of other people.

Instead of being weighed down by ambition,

you just float along
like a dead body in a river.

I couldn't just take the compliment,
I had to ask why.

You know,
I do understand what you're feeling.

My brother and sister's accomplishments
have always been held over my head.

How did you deal with it?

I wet the bed until college,
but I don't think that's a quality fix.

(GRUNTS)

I can't believe
I was surpassed by a geologist!

I mean, rocks!

He studies rocks!

If rock is so great,
how come paper beats it?

Leonard, I'm having a primal urge
to throw this rock.

Do it! Visualize it as your anger
and toss it out of your life.

Perhaps, I will.

This rock encapsulates
all my negative emotions.

I will cast you far away.

Feel free to take out a pigeon
while you're at it.

Let it fly.

Ow! Ow, ow, ow! (YELPING)

What happened?

I tried to let go of anger
and threw a rock into my foot!

Then he got more angry and kicked the rock
with his other foot.

- And what happened to you?
- Oh, I laughed so hard

I burst a blood vessel in my nose,
it's fine.

You know, it's one thing to be envious,
but now you're injuring yourself?

- It has to stop.
- Although, if you're gonna do it again,

please let me know
so I can get it on video.

You know, Sheldon,
instead of fixating on what Bert has,

you should appreciate all of the good
things in your life. You've got love,

you're in good health,
you've got a roof over your head...

Yeah, but you've got all those things,
and no one's lining up to be you.

Anybody else wanna try?
I'm gonna go make some more tea

and question my life choices.

- You're up.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

This is getting old fast, Dolores,
knock it off!

(GRUNTS) Do you really think calling me
names is helpful?

I do! Your life is fine, you big baby!

- Maybe you're right.
- Really?

If it helps, I'm questioning
your life choices, too.

Thank you, Penny. You know, ljust need to
keep reminding myself

-that Bert's success is not my failure.
- There you go!

And that men of his large stature
are more susceptible to a wide array

of life-threatening diseases.

There you go.

- What's up?
-l'm conducting a quick survey.

Do you think this respectful and loving
tribute to a great man is in poor taste?

<i>'($9-</i>

- Do you think this is in poor taste?
- Does it spin around and do tricks?

- Yeah!
- Then, yeah.

- What do you think?
- That is hilarious!

(LAUGHING)

Give me the remote control, I wanna drive
him into the girls' restroom.

All right, we're done, it's offensive.
(CLEARS THROAT)

- Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.
- You're in a good mood.

Oh, it's a new day, I have a new outlook.
You know, I realized

I don't need to worry about other people,
I just need to think more about myself.

Oh, how will we ever get used
to the new you?

Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.

Bert did quality research, and he deserves
whatever accolades he receives.

Wait, what is going on...
Did you upgrade his software last night?

I think he might be learning on his own.

Then the robot uprising has begun.

Excuse me, I need to pay Bert
a proper congratulations.

He doesn't just look like C-3PO,
now he walks like him.

Bert, I wanted to let you know
that I read your research

and your award is well-deserved.

Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot.
Ever since I won, people think I'm great.

Well, just this once you can count me
as people, too.

You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner,

I'm allowed to nominate someone
for next year.

Really? I didn't know that.

So I was thinking, you know,
engineers don't get a lot of respect.

Is your friend, Howard,
working on anything cool?

You know, I'm not sure. No, you'd have to
ask him. Excuse me.

-(SHELDON GASPS)
-(CLATTERING)

<i>SHELDON". Leonard, I hurt myself again!</i>

Excuse me, I have to go
take some pictures.

I can't believe you head-butted
a water fountain.

No, I went to punch the water fountain,

slipped in water
in front of the water fountain

and hit my head on the water fountain.

I can't imagine you being violent.

It's not hard,
just picture The Three Stooges

and then take away two stooges.

I'm so disappointed in myself,
jealousy is completely illogical.

It's a human emotion, Sheldon,
everyone gets jealous.

I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny,
and Howard and Bernadette

-for being in such happy relationships.
- What about me and Sheldon?

Sure.

I've always been jealous of how much money
Raj's family has.

Thank you for saying that.

Next to buying things, that is
the best part about having money.

Well, ever since I met Penny,
I've been envious of her looks.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Aw, thank you.

That's why I was so happy
when you cut your hair off.

What?

You know what I mean. You were still hot,

but more like a "Why'd that hot girl
cut off all her hair" hot.

Well, you liked my hair short, right?

Yes, I loved it!

Love you, love the hair,
would love to change the subject.

Seriously, none of you liked it?

I thought it was brave,
does that count as liking it?

You know, how come nobody's talking about
Howard's dopey haircut?

- I think he looks cute.
- I think you're cute.

- I think you're both cute.
- I think I hate all of you nerds.

- Sorry, I'm moving slowly.
- I don't mind.

If you pull a butterscotch
out of your pocket,

it'll be like I'm walking with my grandma.

Oh, no.

(GRUNTS) A plaque?

(STUTTERS) Nobody wants to see this!

Well. Change "plaque" to "mixed-race
couple" and you are my grandma. (CHUCKLES)

I can't take this anymore.

<i>Bert. Bert. Bert.</i>

- BERT: Come in.
- All right, let's do this.

Bert, we need to talk.

- What happened to you?
- Rock, rock, water fountain.

I am not proud of this, but I've been
envious of your recent success.

Wow.

I won the MacArthur Grant,
everyone's jealous of me...

Once I get Lasik,
I'll be out of things to wish for.

I was hoping by admitting my weakness
to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.

Is it working?

No, now that you know my weakness
I hate you more than ever.

Well, you know, we're both pretty smart.

I bet if we put our heads together,
we could come up with a solution.

Hang on. You're my enemy.

Now if the enemy of my enemy is my friend,
and right now I'm my own worst enemy,

that makes you my friend...
Okay, I'm good to go.

Great, now that we're friends,

wanna see if we can get tickets
to a taping of <i>Ellen?</i>

- You know what, this isn't going to work.
- Sheldon, wait.

You know,
you've got a lot to be happy about.

You're at the top of your field,
you have a great girlfriend.

(GASPS) Yes! That's right, I have Amy!

In the past,
you've professed feelings for her.

Does it eat you up inside that I have her
and you don't?

It used to. But now that I'm rich
and successful, I think I can do better.

I can't believe you punched Bert.

I didn't punch him.

He turned around and I gave him
a Captain Kirk karate chop.

Not even sure he knows I did it.

Hey, Sheldon, I've got someone here
who might make you feel better.

<i>Hello, Sheldon.</i>

-(LEONARD CHUCKLES)
- Professor Hawking?

<i>I understand you're struggling
with professional jealousy.</i>

Thanks, Leonard,
now he's not gonna think I'm cool!

<i>Don't worry, I know how you feel.
I have never won a Nobel Prize.</i>

Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.

<i>It's fine, I've been on The Simpsons.</i>

But how do you deal with the success
of your colleagues?

<i>I remind myself
every scientific advancement is a victory.</i>

<i>Also, I was on Star</i> Trek.

Oh, it was a good one. He played poker
with Sir Isaac... You don't care.

<i>Don't waste your time on jealousy,
Sheldon, you're too brilliant.</i>

How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking
says you're brilliant?

I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking.

You are a gift to mankind.
There should be statues of you everywhere.

You know, the Lincoln Memorial has
a big chair, we could swap you right in.

<i>I always thought a motorized toy of me
would be cool.</i>

What a wonderful idea!
How does this man not have a Nobel?

- Do not tell Wolowitz.
- Way ahead of you.

A new study came out, and it said that
laughing makes your brain work better.

And I know that's true because laughing
has made me the smartiest.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Although, on the other hand,
babies laugh a lot and they're dumb.

Do people know about her?
'Cause she's delightful.

English - SDH

If we're going to be
staying in this apartment,

would you be interested
in doing a little redecorating?

Oh, actually, I would.

Great, what'd you have in mind?

Let's take every single thing
from the other apartment,

and put it in here.

Well, how about we start a little smaller?

Like moving the furniture around.

You know, I have always thought that
this couch would look fantastic

on the curb in front of the building.

Look, we can't just throw away
Penny's stuff,

but we can ask
if she wants any of it back.

You know, I wonder how she feels
about all this artwork.

Well, I'm sure she misses this one.

I mean, it's the greatest gift
I've ever given anybody.

It truly does capture the beauty
of your friendship with Penny.

It may have appreciated in value.

You know, the artist killed himself
shortly after painting that.

Yeah, it seems only right
that she have it back.

Can't wait to see the look on
her face when I give it to her again.

Look, it's the same smile
she has in the painting.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Yeah, there's hooks in the closet,
I can hang it right now.

Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.

What happened to them?

Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween,
I was just giving everything away.

Hey, guys, what are you--
Oh, that's here, cool.

Amy wants me to have it.

Well, it would be selfish of me
to keep it.

But it's a picture of you.

And you.

But you commissioned it.

To give to you.

But you like it so much.

So do you.

- I seem to be losing.
- Yes, you do.

You know, Leonard,
the more I think about it,

there are a number of mutually owned items
in this apartment

that you and I should go through.

For example,

who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?

Why don't you keep it?

That seems fair,
we did just give you the painting.

Yeah, I don't need anything around
that I can stab myself with.

How wonderful, Longclaw is mine.

And how about you keep our avocado plant?

Sounds right,
a limited edition collectible

worth hundreds of dollars,

and a thing that grew out of a thing
we fished from the trash.

Although, Amy and I did just
move in together,

and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.

Fine, take the plant.

Oh, we got a sword and a plant.
Our apartment's really shaping up.

Stuart, you didn't have to get us
a baby gift.

Just homemade coupons for things you might
need help with before the baby gets here.

Going to the grocery store,
driving you to the doctor.

If you're not in a hurry,
I can dig you a koi pond.

A foot massage?

And that's not me being creepy,
that's for either of you.

This is very nice, Stuart, thank you.

How come this one's on the back
of an eviction notice?

Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it,
can I live here?

Stuart, we'd love to help you out,
but this a bad time.

We're about to have a baby.

Or is that why this is a great time?
Think about it.

When that baby comes, you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

Thank you, but I'm not really sure.

Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea.

I mean, he did do a good job
taking care of my mother.

That woman didn't get heat rash once
with me on powder patrol.

Hey, I guess you could stay for a few days
and we'll see how it goes.

Thank you. And it's only temporary,
just till I get back on my feet,

or the baby goes off to college,
whichever happens first.

When would you move in?

Well, my car broke down in your driveway,
so I'm gonna say now.

But I am ready to be helpful.
In fact, gonna go vacuum.

Mmm. Actually ljust did that
this morning.

Okay. Then I'll dust.

I did that, too.

Then I'll check the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

Howard just did that.

Yeah, let him do it.

(SHELDON GASPS)

Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?

Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

<i>AUTOMATED VOICE: Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.</i>

<i>Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.</i>

It's one of a kind.

So if it breaks there'd be none of it?

Well, Leonard, who should keep this?

On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock
more than you do.

But on the other hand,
I care more about clocks than you do.

So you think you should keep it?

I'll be right across the hall.
You'll probably be able to hear it.

Keep the clock, Sheldon.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

Thank you?

Oh. Now, what about our 3-D chess set?

Let me guess, you want it.

Well, no, ljust didn't think you'd want
a physical reminder

of a game you never managed to win.

As a kindness,
I should probably take all the games.

You know what, Sheldon, take it.

In fact, you can have everything.
I really don't care.

Are you sure? These items represent
our shared times together.

- Well, now they're yours.
- Leonard...

Well, you know what's gonna happen.

He's just gonna come up with some reason
why everything should be his.

For a man so good at predicting my moves,
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

Sheldon, you're being a little selfish.

Why don't you let Leonard
keep a few things?

It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing,
I skipped kindergarten.

You know what?
There is one thing I would like.

Take whatever you want.

I would like to keep
the official flag of our apartment.

But you don't even like flags.

I like this one.

But I designed it.

But you made me order it because you were
"too well-known in the flag community

"and they'd jack up the price."

But you don't even understand
its symbolism.

Oh, I do. The field of blue represents
you being miserable,

and the lion sticking its tongue out
means I'm happy about it.

Come along, Amy.

I know when I'm not wanted.

I don't think you do, but all right.

Stuart, you cooked?

How did you know it wasn't me?

There's only three people in this house,
and you'd still be my fifth guess.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
- That's Raj.

You guys relax, I'll get it.

- Have some bread while it's still warm...
-(HOWARD CHUCKLES)

It's like we have a butler.
If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.

You have a Batsuit.

It's pajamas, there's no cape.

- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

Oh, I'm living here again.

Do Howard and Bernadette know?

Or is it like a possum in the walls
kind of thing?

No, I needed a place to stay and,

with the baby coming,
I figured they could use some extra help.

Okay, cool.

Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.

- Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
- Oh.

Okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles
to swell up even more,

she can have that.

Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

Uh, hang on.

I don't think so, I'm clicking on
"One weird trick for a flat belly,"

but I'm still seeing
"Celebrities who look like their pets."

- I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
- Are you sure?

Well, the new network name is,
"Ha, ha, ha, now I've got you."

So, it's either Sheldon
or Gargamel from The Smurfs.

What a jerk.

You're good at revenge.
How do we get him back?

Well, my go-to move is usually
sleep with the person's boyfriend,

but I kind of feel like
I'm already doing that.

Sheldon, I know what you did,
now change the password back.

Well, powder me in sugar
and call me a donut,

if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

Sheldon, I'm warning you,
I can play this game, too.

If it's like your 3-D chess game,

then you're out of your length, width
and depth.

Amy, get the Neosporin,
somebody just got burned.

All right, I tried.

"All right, I tried."

That should be
the title of your autobiography.

Ooh, a second-degree burn.

I've got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?

It's a good thing you're cute.

So, I was reading how it's a good idea

for new parents
to take an infant CPR class.

Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.

Oh, I know a CPR instructor
who'll come to the house.

- That'd be great.
- STUART: I'll give him a call.

We met when I was sleeping on the beach
and he thought I was dead.

Thank you again for cooking.

It's getting tough for me
to be on my feet all day.

You just kick back and relax.
I've got it all under control.

Although it was already under control.
(CLEARS THROAT)

I'm sorry, you mumbled something?

It's just that they've had plenty of help.

Well, you know what they say,
it takes a village.

(CHUCKLES)
Well, they already had a village.

I noticed the village couldn't find time
to put the crib together.

Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy

checking out the local Montessori school
for the new arrival.

You mean the one with
the empty beer bottles in the sandbox?

We'll pass, thank you.

Do something, Batman.

-(GASPS)
- Hey.

What do you think you're doing?

Separating my delicates.

This is the level you're stooping to?

No. This is the level I am stooping to.

I believe that is
flag to crotch four, checkmate.

Easy-peasy, oh, so breezy.

Hey, what's up?

I'm here to put the crib together.

Oh, sorry, I already did it.

Oh, I don't know if you realize this,
but I bought that crib.

Oh, yeah, I read about that
on WhoGivesACrap.com.

Why are you being like this?

Because I love Howard and Bernadette,

and if I want to keep mooching off them,
I need to be helpful.

Hey, this pregnancy had
an emotionally-needy third wheel

way before you came along.

Why can't there be four wheels?

Is this what you do when I'm not here,
make really good points?

Well, look, just come in
and help me build a baby swing.

Thank you.

If you're hungry you can eat your takeout.
Nobody touched it.

I think I'm gonna go for a run.
You want to come?

No, last time that old lady in the park
kept screaming,

"Watch out, he's right behind you."

- Hello?
- Hey, how you doin'?

Uh... Can I help you?

I don't think so,
but you're sweet for asking.

What are you doing in our apartment?

Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor.

Tall guy, dressed like a little boy?

Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don't know what
he told you, but you can't stay here.

So, there are fresh linens
on the bed... Oh!

Well, I see you've met Theodore.

Theodore, these are your new roommates,
Leonard and Penny.

They're very honest,
but I would not leave cash lying around.

Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?

My room is paid up
until the end of the month,

so I can do with it whatever I please,

which includes renting it out
for a dollar a night.

It's like the '40s again.

Anyway, I'll leave you be. I have to--
Oh, oh!

He's expecting a newspaper in the morning.

Yeah, apparently, they still make them.

All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.

Yeah, that's true, but had I done
something under the line,

there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen
who can't produce a single form of ID.

(STAMMERS)
I have a receipt from a blood bank.

I'm O negative.

And now you know as much about him
as I do.

Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes
with two different mobiles.

The giraffes are pretty cute,
what do you think?

Great, go with the giraffes.

Although the high contrast
of zebra stripes

might provide better stimulus
for a developing baby.

Yeah, you're probably right,
go with the zebras.

Good choice, boss.

At least my nose is naturally brown.

Hey, could you please
go to the market for me?

Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

Howie, they've been doing
everything for you.

Hmm, I know. It's really making me
lose respect for both of them.

Please just go to the store.

Fine.

Who wants to drive me to the store?

<i>RAJ: Me!
STUART: I'll do it!</i>

Take Raj.
Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

What do you think?
Should we go to a hotel?

And just leave him here alone?

Okay, I'll go to a hotel. Text me
in the morning if you're still alive.

Theodore, how long are you planning
to stay exactly?

Thanks to the coins I found in your couch,
day longer than I thought.

This is ridiculous.

(DOOR OPENS)

I like the painting. ls that your mom?

Sheldon, get out here!

Will you keep it down?

What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast
do you think I'm running?

We lived together 13 years.
How can you be so awful to me?

I'm being awful? You're the one who
went out of your way to hurt me.

Because you were being selfish.

Dividing our belongings is difficult.

Why? I said I didn't care!

Excuse me.

It's none of my business,

but it sounds like a lot of this anger
is coming from love.

Thanks, but nobody asked you.

Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking.

Seems like, with Sheldon moving out,
you're in a new phase of your lives,

and it's easier to fight than to face the
feelings that you have for one another.

I think he might be right.

Also, who is that?

I have to admit,

leaving you to move in with Amy has been
harder than I thought it would be.

For me, too.
It's not the same with you gone.

If you're looking for a new guy
to live with--

- No!
- We're okay. Thank you.

So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.

Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting
about our possessions.

Well, I'd like that, too.

In fact, I want you to keep
the apartment flag,

and I'm not just saying that
because it touched your genitals.

- Promise?
- I do.

And to show you
that there are no hard feelings,

lam willing to rub my genitals
on it as well.

Well, if we're rubbing genitals on things,
that's where I shine.

Little lower to the left.

A little more.

Good?

No, still hideous.

Well, I'm sure at some point,
we won't even notice it's there.

Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while
it starts showing up in your dreams.

I think it brings the room together.

Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint
the nursery?

I'll do it.

Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.

Just because you're starving,
doesn't make you an artist.

Just because I look sickly,
doesn't mean I'm starving.

<i>BERNADETTE'. Howard!</i>

Guys, you heard her,
go see what she wants.

I think I'm in labor.

Whoa, whoa, okay.
Okay, uh, I can do this. We have a plan.

Somebody please tell me the plan.

- I'll get the hospital bag.
- I'll pull the van up.

- Meet you outside in two minutes.
- Team Baby, go!

- I love you.
- I love you, too.

Are we hugging or having a baby? Let's go!

English - SDH

BERNADETTE:
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?

- Oh, I'm living here again.
- Do Howard and Bernadette know?

Or is it like a possum in the walls
kind of thing?

No, I needed a place to stay and,

with the baby coming,
I figured they could use some extra help.

Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint
the nursery?

I'll do it.

Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.

Just because you're starving,
doesn't make you an artist.

Just because I look sickly,
doesn't mean I'm starving.

Howard! I think I'm in labor.

Whoa, whoa, okay.
Okay, uh, I can do this. We have a plan.

Somebody please tell me the plan.

- I'll get the hospital bag.
- I'll pull the van up.

- Meet you outside in two minutes.
- Team Baby, go!

Oh, man. This is really happening.
You doing okay?

Here comes another contraction.

Let's pick it up.

All right. Hold on, I'm going to drive
like we do in India.

-(HORN HONKS)
- Get out of the way, you syphilitic dogs!

Stop that, this isn't India.

(SCOFFS) Fine.

What do 1.3 billion people
know about having babies?

Sorry, I know you're just trying to help.

- I love you.
- I love you, too. We're good.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Amy? Wake up.

What's wrong?

It's midnight.

Happy birthday.

(SIGHS) Sheldon.

(BLOWS)

Okay, you can have this back
in the morning.

All right. This is for you.

I was going to wrap it

but touching Scotch tape
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

I'll put it on the list
with peaches and felt.

What is this?

A functional MRI of my brain.

I did Sudoku before they took it
so I'd be ripped.

I love it, thank you.

And it's not just an MRI,

the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up
because I was thinking of you.

Sheldon.

We seem to be moving on to the annual

coitus portion
of your birthday festivities.

Is that okay?

I didn't put on my come-hither
plaid pj's for nothing.

You hate Scotch tape,
but you love Scotch plaid.

You are a mystery.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

PENNY: <i>Guys, wake up.
Bernadette's having her baby.</i>

<i>LEONARD: Come on,
we're going to the hospital.</i>

I guess we should stop.

I'm afraid so.

Childbirth, looming coitus?

It's a banner night for female genitals.

Now, I see three of you.

Do we know the father or is this
some Mamma <i>Mia!</i> nonsense?

I'm the father.

Okay, Dad,
how far apart are the contractions?

No idea, ask him.

Twelve minutes.

Twelve minutes? Why are you here?

Aren't we supposed to get here
an hour and a half early?

This is a hospital, not the airport.

I'm sorry, it's our first time.

On, it's okay.

This little one will be here
before you know it.

- Do we know what we're having?
- No, we're keeping it a surprise.

Old school, nice.

Eh. Not that old school, he knows.

(IN SLOW TONE)
You see, I was at the doctor's office,

the folder was right there,
so I took a peek.

(IMITATES RAJ'S TONE) And talking
like this doesn't make it less creepy.

Sweetheart, go home.

Come back when the contractions
are five minutes apart for an hour.

I'm sorry, that's ambiguous.
ls it five minutes apart

starting at the top of the hour

or five minutes apart
starting with the first contraction,

so essentially, like, 65 minutes?

I'm just throwing this out there,

but home births
are very popular these days.

Sheldon, what took you so long?

Wolowitz might hand out cigars.

I had to find my bubble gum cigar so
I could join in without looking foolish.

Damn, I need my inhaler.

- Just don't smoke.
- No, I went down the stairs too fast.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hey.

Don't come to the hospital,
we're headed home.

That was fast,
did she sneeze the baby out?

We showed up too early.
We'll keep you posted.

Okay. Well,
we'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

She said not to come,
it's going to be a while.

(SIGHS)
Well, first deliveries can be slow.

I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie
I bought this kid.

I found it, but it's empty.

Well, it doesn't matter,
we're not going to the hospital now.

(WHEEZING) Are you sure?
I'd really like to.

Well, should we, uh,

head back up?

Come on, guys. We're all awake.
Why don't we go to a diner or something?

Oh, uh,

I don't know. Sheldon,
you don't want to do that, do you?

It doesn't matter what I want.
It's your birthday, you decide.

Oh, my God. It's your birthday.
Let's do something fun.

<i>- Uh ___</i>
- Oh, we can go to a bar...

Well...

Okay, I can breathe again.
Babe, they want to have sex.

Oh, of course.
The annual birthday booty spectacular.

That's a bit Childish, isn't it?

I'm sorry, and what flavor
is your bubble gum cigar?

Grape. I find it the most mild.

All right. Well, you two go have fun.

If we find my backup inhaler
maybe we can get frisky.

PENNY: Oh, you sexy, wheezy, little man.

<i>Do you really need to record this?</i>

<i>RAJ". You'll be happy I did.</i>

<i>Okay, little one, here we are</i>

<i>back at home because you weren't
quite ready to come out yet.</i>

<i>You wanted to make an entrance, I get it.
(CHUCKLES)</i>

<i>And here's your daddy.</i>

<i>When he tries to tell you
he used to be cool,</i>

<i>you can see he wasn't.</i>

<i>All right, enough with the camera.</i>

What? This is not for me,
this is for the baby.

Someday she's going to want to see this.

I'm sorry.

Who's going to want to see this?

(STAMMERS) I said "she"
but lots of things are she.

Boats, cars, whales. "Thar she blows!"

You're doing great.

Raj.

Okay. Uh, I'm going to sign off now,

<i>this next part may contain
some adult language.</i>

How could you?

We made it this far without knowing
and you ruined it.

Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is

to know something like this
and not say it.

You told me it was a girl
and I didn't say it.

Raj.

You were supposed to
keep that to yourself.

Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

(CHUCKLES) So, where were we?

I believe we were kissing
like randy teenagers,

and your nose
was whistling ever so slightly.

- L'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

You were like a foxy teakettle.

(CHUCKLES)

Well, shall we start over?

Very well.

What's wrong?

I'm not sure.

Earlier tonight things began organically
and now it's feeling forced.

Like all <i>the
Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.</i>

Okay, that makes sense.
I mean, the mood's a little different now.

We don't have to rush.

Oh, I know, but Leonard and Penny
think we're doing it.

And I don't want to disappoint them.

And the mood continues to change.

No, and also
I don't want to disappoint you.

You know, come on, it's your birthday,
I can soldier through this.

Hold on.

I think I might have a little surprise
that might help

get things back on track.

Intriguing.

Is "back on track" a hint
that it has something to do with trains?

No.

Because if it did have to do with trains--

<i>ANN". It's not about trains.</i>

<i>- Not even</i> a <i>cozy sleeper</i> car--
<i>- Stop talking about trains!</i>

Who's killing the mood now?

Found the backup inhaler.
Want to have sex?

- Well, I didn't until I heard that.
-(INHALES)

Hang on, I'm counting.

(EXHALES) It's okay.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- RAJ: (awe-some) Hello,

<i>Howard and Bernadette kicked me out
because I told them they're having a girl.</i>

<i>Oopsie, I did it again.</i>

(SIGHS)

Maybe, if we're quiet, he'll go away.

<i>RAJ: (SING-SONG) You're going to have
to be quieter than that.</i>

Can I look yet?

<i>ANN: One second.</i>

-(DOOR OPENS)
-(AMY CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

<i>All right, you can open your eyes.</i>

I thought I'd let Harry Potter
make things hotter.

(GIGGLES)

Wowza.

I got a Gryffindor robe for you.

(GASPS)

A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff?

How scandalous.

You naughty girl.

You went to the Wizarding World theme park
without me.

I did, am I in trouble?

(GIGGLES)

Yes, you're in trouble.
You went to Wizarding World without me.

Wait, wait, wait. What just happened?

You know I've been wanting to go.

(SIGHS) Sheldon, do you really want to
argue with me on my birthday?

Um, you're right. I'm sorry.

Ooh, happy birthday to me. (CHUCKLES)

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- RAJ: (awe-some) Hello.

Is this about the baby?

No, people just keep kicking me out
everywhere I go.

Good, then you're used to this.

- Hey, Bernadette's water broke!
- Come on, everyone to the hospital!

<i>AMY". You have got to be kidding me!</i>

Just try to relax,
we'll be there any minute.

Stuart, stop driving like an old man,
speed it up a little.

I'm not an old man.

I just can't see at night.

(GRUNTS) Here comes another one.

Hey, squinty,
the gas pedal's on the right!

All right, hang on.

If you see any pedestrians
just call 'em out.

Howard and Bernadette's kid
might be born on your birthday.

How cool is that?

Yeah. But I thought this baby was supposed
to ruin their sex life, not mine.

This is not how I imagined this day going.
I should be with them right now.

Well, it is their Child.

I know that. But, to be fair,

I've spent nine months helping Bernadette
get ready for this baby.

Howard spent five minutes conceiving it,

and I'm being generous.

Five minutes?

Oh, we must be doing it wrong.
Took us hours.

And the worst part is that
they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.

I understand, but this is a special day
for them.

Can you just try and let it go?

She's right.

Now, ljust learned
Amy went to a theme park without me,

but I'm not going to ruin her birthday.

I'll wait and ruin 24 individual hours
sprinkled throughout the year.

Boop.

(GRUNTS)

Deep breaths, slow breaths.

I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.

(CRUNCHING)

Sorry.

I thought these were room ice chips.

I'll go get some more.

Uh, Stuart, while you're out there,
don't come back.

-(HOWARD CHUCKLES)
-(DOOR CLOSES)

So, what are we going to name this kid?

Now that we know she's a girl,

it kind of ruins my plan
for Wally Wolowitz.

We could name her after your mom.

Debbie? (CHUCKLES)

No, she hated that name.

Did she have a middle name?

Melvina.

Let's keep thinking.

(SIGHS)

It sucks that she's not here.

- I know.
-(CHUCKLES)

She would've been the best grandma.

She did always have candy in her pocket.

(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah. I was

twenty years old before I figured out
Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.

I didn't know her five minutes
and she asked

(IMITATES MRS. WOLOWITZ)
"Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"

Thank God you answered right,
we wouldn't be here today.

It's hard to believe
Howard's having a kid.

Yeah.

Penny, you're the one
who introduced him to Bernie.

How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

And it's not just Howard and Bernadette.

Look how far we've all come.

- You two got married.
-(PENNY CHUCKLES)

Sheldon and I are living together.

But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.

Penny was a struggling actress when we met
and now she's

a successful pharmaceutical rep.

You don't have to say <i>struggling</i>
every time, you can just say actress.

Howard went to space.

Bernadette got her doctorate.

Sheldon, Howard, and I are working with
the government on our quantum gyroscope.

We have all come a long way.

There's a lot to be proud of.

For God's sake, just drive in the knife,
why don't you?

- What's your problem?
- You're all thinking it.

I'm the only one who hasn't done
anything worthwhile.

I was not thinking it.

Although, now that you've point it out,
it is undeniable.

Raj, if it's any consolation,

I'm no better off
than I was 10 years ago.

Oh, YaY-

I have a doctorate in astrophysics
and I'm every bit as awesome

as the pasty-faced owner
of a comic book store.

Raj, show some compassion.

Those are things that we think
but don't say.

Excuse me.

Sorry, Stuart.

Hey, I'm in a hospital
and I'm not the patient,

I'm fine.

- Come on, Bernie. Breathe.
-(PANTING)

Remember what you learned
in birthing class.

I remember thinking "This is stupid,"
and I was right.

Do you want me to get the nurse?

No. If one more person puts
their fingers near my uterus

I'm going to cross my legs
and snap 'em off.

I've come to peace with my relationship
with my parents.

That was a big milestone for me.

Oh, speaking of personal growth.

I recently tried eating Swiss chard.

Now, I didn't swallow it,
but Amy said it counted.

- Hey.
- Hey.

(CLEARS THROAT)

You still a loser or did you
turn things around while you were gone?

You know, Raj, honey,
you're being too hard on yourself.

When I first met you,
you couldn't even talk to women.

You couldn't even talk
if one was in the room.

Great, now I can say things like,

"I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

"Why are you breaking up with me?

"Yes, I'll still help you move."

Anyone else want to try?

Uh, yeah. I got something.

Raj, not everybody can be a dog owner.

Oh, what, did your doggie
break up with you, too?

Hey, I bought M&M's at the vending machine
and two bags came out.

I bought the first one, it didn't fall.

Here.

She's here, the baby's here.

-(PENNY SQUEALS)
- RAJ: Congratulations.

- How's Bernadette?
- Tired, but great. They're both great.

Does the baby have a name yet?

- We have named her Halley.
- Aw.

- Like Halley's comet.
- Exactly.

Also like the comet, Bernadette said

she's not going to have sex with me
for another 75 years.

That's not a real thing. He's just joking.

I'm going to get back.
Thank you for staying up.

I can't wait for Halley to meet her
new aunts and uncles

and godfather.

- Really?
- Of course.

You hear that, Stuart? I've got a dog
and a godchild, you have nothing!

Oh, look at all the babies.

Some will be successful.

Some may be homeless.

It's fun to think about.

I wonder which one's Halley.

It's kind of hard to see the names.

Mmm. That one kind of
looks like Bernadette.

They all look the same to me.

Guys, she's my goddaughter.
I think I'll know when I see her.

(BABY BAWLING IN HOARSE VOICE)

<i>That one.</i>

(CONTINUES BAWLING)

- Well, that was quite a day.
- It was.

Bernadette had her baby,
I made it to Wizarding World,

and now it is time
to complete your birthday celebration.

Hankius-Pankius.

I was afraid you'd be too tired.

Amy, ljust saw a magic train

and reported somebody
for cutting the line.

If that's not foreplay,
I don't know what is.

(AMY CHUCKLES)

English - SDH

Hey, can you help me
put some of the food out?

Yeah, let me finish packing this stuff up.

You know how Sheldon is
if he sees Christmas stuff

lying around after New Year's.

Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.

He doesn't live at Walmart.
But he still threw a tantrum

when he saw
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

And that's the same man who complains

you can't find
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

Oh, it's Bernadette.
She says they're running late.

"The baby threw up on Howard
and then Howard threw up on Howard."

Well, he didn't throw up on the baby.
That's a win.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Hi! Welcome back! How was Texas?

Oh, you know, the Lone Star State.
That should be its Yelp rating.

It was not a great trip.

- Well, you're home now.
- Yeah, it is good to be home.

Good Lord! ls that mistletoe?

Don't you maniacs own a calendar?

I told him to take it down.
He would not listen to me.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Did you at least have
a good flight down there?

It was fine. And other than the
weird-tasting juice Amy gave me,

I slept the whole way.

So, what happened in Texas
that was so bad?

And before our next drive to Comic-Con,
I need the name of that juice.

Well, we were on our way
to my mother's house...

(GASPS) How did we get in the car?

Hold on.

How did you get him in the car?

I rented one of those carts,
pushed him toward the open door

and, just let inertia
take care of the rest.

So, while we're at your mother's house,

it might be a good time to tell her
that we're living together.

Do we have to?

I really don't want to hear
the religious lecture.

Maybe there won't be one.

There's always one.

She gave it to my sister
about her boyfriend.

My brother about his girlfriend.

My father about his girlfriend.

That one had some
un-Christian words in it.

Well, she likes me.

There's a chance
she might be okay with it.

I don't know.

I am her precious little boy,

and you did take my flower.

Do boys have flowers?

Who knows what he has down there.

Anyway...

Thank you, God, for the food
that we are about to receive

and for the nourishment of our bodies

and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

Given that your hands prepared it,
isn't that a little self-serving?

You start changing
the words to the prayers,

next thing you know,
you're in a church with a guitar.

Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.

Oh, it's my pleasure.

I'm so glad y'all could make it.
So, tell me what's going on back home.

Well, Howard and Bernadette
had their baby.

Oh, that's wonderful!

Now, have they decided to raise it
Jewish or regular?

Welcome to Texas.

They haven't said.

Anyway, we also have
some exciting news to share.

(STAMMERING) Wait now.
Shouldn't we just eat?

You know, I mean, God did take time
out of his busy schedule

to bless these Sloppy Joes.

Come on, Shelly. Tell me your news.

- Right.
- This is on you. (CLEARS THROAT)

Amy and I are living together in sin,
like a couple of New Yorkers.

Now, while you scold us,
I'm going to get a knife and a fork.

Joe may be sloppy but Sheldon's not.

Well, thank you for letting me know.
And I, for one, am thrilled.

What?

Where's the judgment?

Where's the fire and brimstone?

Where's the part where you tell us
we're going to hell,

and I say, "Have you seen the size
of the bugs outside? We're already there!"

Obviously I would prefer
if you weren't living out of wedlock,

but given your special circumstances,
I'm very happy for you.

And what special circumstances are those?

Oh, boy. I think it's about to get bad.

Shelly, how do I put this?

By your third birthday, you had memorized
over a thousand different kinds of trains.

And I never imagined a woman
getting aboard any of them.

What? So... You thought I was
going to be alone for the rest of my life?

No. Just for the middle part.

'Cause at the end,
I assumed there'd be nurses.

Well, this is highly insulting.

Sheldon, don't overreact.

I'm the child she was worried about?

I have a brother and sister
whose combined intellectual wattage

couldn't power a potato clock.

If I spotted them the potato.

(INDISTINCT BLABBERING)

What?

I was in my room.
I couldn't hear what they were saying.

I'll take over from here.

He's been in there a long time.

Should I go talk to him?

He's upset with me.
I should be the one who talks to him.

- Are you going to?
- Oh, heck, no.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

Just being the un-socialized eccentric
my mother always thought I was.

You startin' to see
why I didn't go in there?

Sheldon, if you're trying
to prove me wrong,

the tighty-whities on your head
ain't changing my mind.

We're ignoring the fins. Okay.

And I don't understand
why you're taking her side.

By being my girlfriend
she's saying, you're a weirdo, too.

I don't think that's what she's saying.

And...

That's exactly what she was saying.

Can you believe
my mother thinks we're both strange?

Absolutely not.

Yes. Too loud.

(SOFTLY) Absolutely not.

Well, after that Sheldon and I
got out of the house for a while.

Well, first we buttered my feet

to get the swim fins off,
and then we went out.

I'm sorry your mother
made you feel bad, but...

You know, at the end of the day
she was wrong, because you're not alone.

You're right.

I have Leonard and Howard and Raj,

Stuart, Penny, Leonard's mom,
Bernadette, Wil Wheaton--

What about the woman
who just buttered your big flat feet?

I was going chronologically.

You're right between Koothrappali's father
and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.

Well, let's try to not let it ruin
the rest of our trip.

I knew we should've never mentioned
us living together in the first place.

- She was going to find out eventually.
- Disagree.

We've known about evolution since 1859.

She still believes in Noah
and his amazing zoo boat.

This could have all been avoided
if you had only listened to me.

Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine
with us living together

because I already told her we were.

Why would you do that?

This was a potential issue,

so I got out ahead of it
and I managed the situation for you.

You managed the situation?

That's right.

So, my mother thought
I was incapable of finding a mate,

and my mate thinks
I'm incapable of running my own life.

Not your whole life.
I mean, science, you got that.

Organizing your sock drawer,
you're the king.

But understanding
how other people are feeling,

that's a weak spot for you.

I have gotten much better at that.

Have you? How am I feeling right now?

How should I know?

Excited, itchy? Give me the first letter.

You and I are in a relationship.

I help you with your shortcomings,
and you help me with mine.

How would you feel if I contacted
your mother behind your back?

Delighted that you showed
any interest in my family at all.

Delighted?

Not if I guessed for 100 years.

- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

- Hi.
- There's the little family.

Hello.

And their Sherpas.

The baby's asleep.
Can we put her in your room?

- Yeah, go ahead.
- Do you need help?

No, I got it.

Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.

- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, it's no problem.

Amy and Sheldon were just telling us
about their trip to Texas.

Yeah, here, I'll catch you up.

- How did we get in the car?
- Stop.

Okay, they told Mary they were
living together, there was a fight.

He got his feelings hurt,
then he put underwear on his head--

On purpose. Not the way it
used to happen in high school.

I was acting odd intentionally.

Really? So you can control it?

Okay, then what happened?

There's really not much left to tell.

No, I decided that
my mother views me as a child

because I never went through
a rebellious phase so, I got an earring...

-(CLICKS)
-(SCREAMS)

My mother made me take it out...

(SCREAMS)

Amy put alcohol on it...

(SCREAMS)

And here we are.

- What did we miss?
- I couldn't explain it if I tried.

So, tell me,
how did Sheldon look with an earring?

Like the pirate who helps
the other pirates connect to the Internet.

So, what did you and Leonard do?

Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.

It might've been
the worst one we ever had.

Oh, my God. What happened?

Well, we had started binge watching
Luke Cage together,

and it was kind of our thing,

and then, I find out that she watched
two episodes without me.

It's like I was excited for a present
and got socks.

I don't understand how that turns
into the worst fight of your life.

I don't understand
what's wrong with socks.

To be fair, we may have been on edge
because of the Christmas tree.

What happened with the tree?

You do make a cute elf.

Yeah? And you thought Spock ears
were only good for Comic-Con.

Hey, hey. ljust found a farm where they
let you chop down your own tree.

Oh, cool. I'll be like
a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.

Stupid idea.

No. What's stupid is
a physicist who doesn't understand

when you swing an ax, you don't let go.

For the tenth time,
my mittens were slippery!

Oh! It's 70 degrees.
You didn't need mittens.

You know how easily I blister.

Yes, yes. You bruise, you peel...

It's like I'm married
to an old piece of fruit.

Look, we could keep fighting
and let it ruin our night,

or we can stop
and try to salvage the evening.

- Fine.
- Thank you.

(THUDS)

PENNY: Leonard?
LEONARD: Yeah.

There's something on the windshield.

(GRUNTING)

PENNY: You need a break?

LEONARD: I do not need a break.

PENNY: There's no shame
in asking for a break.

LEONARD: If I need a break,
I'll ask for a break!

- Leonard?
- Yeah?

There's a tree on you.

You wanna decorate it tonight?

Yeah. With gasoline and a match, sure.

(BOTH GRUNTING AND PANTING)

(ANIMAL CHITTERING)

I hope it kills us both.

By the way, if anyone asks,

the elevator shaft
always had a tree in it.

So, Bernadette,
if I express interest in your baby,

will you promise not to make me touch it?

- Sure.
- Hey, how's life with your baby?

Really? You're never going to
touch their baby?

To this day, I've never touched Stuart.

It's been wonderful, Sheldon.
Thanks for asking.

(BABY CRYING)

<i>BERNADETTE: Stop crying. I'm begging you.
I don't know what else to do.</i>

<i>My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna?</i>

(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

<i>(SHUSHING) It's okay. It's okay.</i>

(CRYING STOPS)

What have we done?

Hey, I found superhero baby wipes.

The perfect way to clean up crime,
and tushies.

(BABY CRYING)

It took me two hours to get her down.

You relax. I'll take this shift.

You know, in India,
when my baby brother cried like that,

the servants would just take him
far away so we couldn't hear it.

Not always. Sometimes, we'd leave.

(CRYING STOPS)

Hey, he got her to stop.

That was so fast.

He's really good with her.

Yeah, he has a gift.

What's the matter?

Nothing, these are happy tears.

- Oh, good.
- No, they're not, you bozo!

How come Stuart
can get her to stop crying, but I can't?

It's Stuart.

Maybe she's playing possum
until he goes away.

Not funny.

She's tired. That was funny.

Everyone's a better mom than me.

Oh, don't take it so personally.
Maybe your baby's just a jerk.

(WAILING)

So, how does the story end?

Is the baby a jerk
or is Bernadette a bad mother?

Sheldon!

What? ls there another twist coming?
ls the baby not theirs at all?

Ignore him.
How did you get the baby to stop crying?

Oh, ljust talked to her.

I've been told the sound of my voice
puts people to sleep.

You poor things, you must be exhausted.

It has been hard to sleep
with all the crying.

(WAILING)

How can she hate me?
I make her food in my chest!

It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.

She doesn't hate you. Stop saying that.

Now you hate me, too!

(SHUSHING) I don't hate you.

(BABY CRYING)

(CONTINUES WAILING)

(CRYING)

It says here that "up to 80%
of new mothers experience baby blues,"

and that "the best thing to do
is reassure them

"that they're doing a good job."

Bernadette, you are doing a good job.

Thank you, Sheldon.
I'm feeling better now.

Thank you, Internet.

I'm telling you,
with the right YouTube video,

I could give Howard a vasectomy.

So, things started to turn around?

Yeah, eventually I figured out
how to get the baby to sleep.

Please tell me
you didn't use Amy's magic juice.

HOWARD: (WHISPERING) Bernie?
BERNADETTE: <i>Shh. She's asleep.</i>

Great.

And where are you?

BERNADETTE: Down here.

HOWARD: Oh.

This is new.

I didn't know what else to do. It worked.

I'd say that's thinking outside the box,
but... Come on.

Don't make me laugh.

Do you need help getting out?

I think I live here now.

It's fine.

Is it okay if I get some sleep?

Yeah, go ahead.

Good job, Mommy.

I'm proud of you.

Don't make me cry, either.

Good night.

I love both my girls.

We love you, too.

I can't believe you fit in the crib.

I could take a bath in the sink.

I don't, but I can.

- So, how were your holidays?
- Oh.

Thank you for asking.

I went to visit my grandmother.

She's in Bakersfield.

Usually my brother and sister go--

(ALL SNORING)

Oh, come on!

- That was fun. Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

- Our pleasure.
- See you guys at work.

- RAJ: Be there bright and early.
- Not me, paternity leave.

A small human wreaks havoc

on his wife's genitals
and he gets time off.

With pay, sucker!

Forgot the baby. Still new to this.

English - SDH

HOWARD:
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

(BABY CRYING)

<i>BERNADETTE: Stop crying. I'm begging you.
I don't know what else to do.</i>

<i>My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna?</i>

(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

<i>(SHUSHES) It's okay. It's okay.</i>

What have we done?

What's all this?

Well, it sounded like
you were having a rough day,

so I wanted you to come home
to something nice.

Oh, that is so thoughtful.

Hey, do you remember when we went
wine tasting in Santa Barbara

and you said that was the best rose
you'd ever had?

Yeah, I remember us driving up there,
going to the winery and that's it.

- This wine is why.
- Oh!

Hey, what smells so good?

- Oh, I made your favorite. Pizza bagels.
-(GASPS)

Pink wine and pizza bagels!
It's like eighth grade all over again!

I am so lucky to have you.

Well, be careful. These are hot.

I could explain the thermodynamics of
why the cheese seems hotter than the crust

but instead
I'm going to keep it to myself.

Oh! You always know what not to say.

I just-- I can't believe you did all this.

Well, you know, it's easy to take
each other for granted

and I never wanna do that
to you because...

Your love, it's like a river.

It's peaceful and deep.

Your soul is... It's like a secret
that I never could keep.

You did not just quote an *NSYNC song.

I quoted your favorite *NSYNC song.

Ohh!

(BURPS)

Damn. I burped so hard I died in my game.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Leonard, I've been meaning to ask you.
What size shoe do you wear?

<i>Why'?</i>

I'm trying to take more of an interest
in other people's lives.

That's nice.
I wear a size eight and a half.

(CHUCKLES) That's small.

So, tell me,
do you have any plans for the weekend?

Are you gonna laugh at the answer?

Only if the answer is
"Shopping for baby shoes."

If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend
from work and she's taking me.

Oh, well, that is interesting.

Now I wonder what kind of infection
you'll come home with.

My money's on fungal.

They're still having girls'
night across the hall.

So, hang outwith me
and we'll have boys' night.

At our age,
why don't we call it man's night?

Because we just spent our
allowance on comic books.

Penny, is it weird
that we're having girls' night here

but you don't live here anymore,
so it's basically my girls' night?

Hadn't really thought about it.

But now you're thinking about it
and it bothers you. I get that.

Things going well with
you and Sheldon living together?

Better than ever.

He asks about my day,
takes an interest in my life.

He's like my boyfriend in college

except he's real so people can see him.

I've been seeing him for years.
I'm still not convinced he's real.

Hey, can I ask you a question?
You've been married for a while.

Is it normal for the husband
to kind of completely stop giving a crap?

(SIGHS) Uh-oh, what's going on?

Leonard used to do all these things,
like bring me flowers and wear pants.

It's okay, Howie never has on pants.

The Domino's guy
brings the pizza like this now.

Well, Sheldon always has his pants on.

I don't think I could pick
his knees out of a lineup.

No, it's not just the pants.

It's like since we got married,
he doesn't really try anymore.

Uh, Penny, I don't know how to say this,

but this is my first girls' night, and
you're kind of bumming everybody out.

All right, got Halley to sleep.

I heard you on the baby monitor.

Didn't think you could turn the theme
from Walking <i>Dead</i> into a lullaby.

(SIGHS) Got to get her hooked on TV,
or someday she'll want me to play outside.

Boy, that floor is so squeaky.

Surprised I didn't wake her up
walking out of the room.

Have you tried anything to fix it?

Oh, I put the rug down. Didn't help.

I know. Blue shag.
What were you thinking?

Did try nailing
a couple of the boards down.

- Did that do anything?
- Yeah.

Left little holes in the floor.
That's why I bought the rug.

If you do that, I'll win in eight moves.

I'll win in five moves.

I'll win in one move.

Oh, no! Good game.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Oh, Penny. I'm trying to take an interest
in other people.

How was your girls' night?

It was fine.

Did you have anything to eat?

Uh, chips.

(MUTTERS) Anything to drink?

Some wine.

Boy, I'm just playing tennis
against the drapes here.

Just ignore him.

Mmm, at least he took an interest.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing.

Hey, what's going on with you?

I don't wanna talk about it.

Oh, hey, come on. Just tell me.

Fine. Lately, I kind of feel like
you've been taking me for granted.

What? Where is this coming from?

Leonard, she might be drunk.
All she had was chips.

It's just, since we got married,

you seem to think
you don't have to try anymore.

That is ridiculous.

This is exactly why
I didn't want to talk about it.

No, no, no. Let's talk about it.

I'm the one who's made all the effort
in this relationship since day one.

Please tell me what more I could do.

Okay, you know what?

Maybe I'll take Amy with me to the spa
this weekend instead.

All right. Go ahead.

Amy is free.

She had a harp lesson on Saturday
but it got canceled. (STUTTERS)

Boy, when you take an interest in people
you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.

Okay. Thanks, Daddy.

He said the only way to really fix
an old floor like that

is to tear it up
and replace the whole thing.

That sounds expensive.

Hang on. No offense to her father,
but he's not an MIT-trained engineer.

Thinking and building is what you do.

MIT's motto is "Mind and Hand."
Which, just so happens,

was also my motto as a lonely teenager.

(RAJ AND BERNADETTE CHUCKLE)

Oh, come on,
we just need to be more creative.

What if you didn't
step on the floor at all?

Like, what if you swung on a rope
from the ceiling?

Uh... (GRUNTS)

No.

Okay. Um...

Okay, what if you rig up a pulley system

and move yourself across the room
in a harness?

On! (CHUCKLES)

(SQUEAKING)

No.

I have one.

What if you got a giant slingshot
and flung yourself into the wall?

(SCOFFS)

-ls that supposed to be funny?
- Hold on.

(SCREAMING)

(SHATTERING)

Yeah, that's funny.

- All right, we're heading out.
- Mmm-hmm.

I'll call you when we get to the hotel.

And if they have
any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?

I will bring them home so you can
show me how Godzilla takes a shower.

- Have fun.
- Thanks. Are you ready?

Uh-huh.

Bye, Sheldon.

You know what? I feel uncomfortable
engaging in a public display of affection

while their relationship is strained.

Go ahead. It's fine.

- Bye.
- Bye.

- Okay.
- Let's go.

- Bye.
- Bye.

I'll miss you.

- I'll miss you, too.
- I'll miss you more.

Well, if X equals the amount that you'll
miss me, then I'll miss you X plus one.

If you miss me X plus one,
I'll miss you

open paren X plus one,
close paren--

Thank you.

Here. You're sad, so I made you tea.

Thanks.

And it's just the way you like it.

- Earl Grey?
- Yes.

- Honey? Unsweetened--
- Yes.

Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.

Sorry. Thank you.

Oh, what can we do to cheer you up?

I really don't know.

<i>Do you want to play Jenga?
Or Ticket to Ride?</i>

Hearthstone? What would you be
the happiest losing at?

- I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.
- Wow!

I remember when
you loved playing games with me.

Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship
you're phoning in.

It's not that I'd stopped trying.
It's just how relationships progress.

They start with infatuation, but over time
mellow into something more comfortable.

Mmm, yeah, you're right.

It's like when I first encountered
the Pythagorean theorem.

I was blown away that the square of the
hypotenuse was the sum of the squares

of the opposite sides.
Yeah, but now I'm just like... Eh!

Okay, this grid represents the room.

All we need to do is plot out

where each squeak is
and we can find a quiet path to the crib.

<i>Looks like</i> a <i>map
from Dungeons</i> & <i>Dragons.</i>

Mmm... Except the creature in the crib
is a level nine poop monster.

(SNICKERS) Okay, you check for squeaks,
and I will mark them down.

Okay. Space A3. Here we go.

(SQUEAKING)

It's squeaking, mark it.

It's nice to think
that you grew up in this room

and now your daughter
is going to as well.

Mmm. I hope she has the same
amount of sex in it I did.

None. Next square.

Why do you bounce
with your hands in the air like that?

(CHUCKLES) It's a tradition of my people.

(SCATTING AND HUMMING)

<i>Material Girl</i> needs to be retired.
That is your karaoke song.

Would you like to play
a driving game I invented?

Is it about the failing state
of my relationship with Penny?

Never mind.

You know, Penny went to this spa
to be away from you.

Are you sure you should be going there?

I don't want to wait two days
for us to work this out.

Very well.
And you got married spur of the moment.

I don't see why your divorce
should be any different.

I would pull this car over
and kick you out

but if Penny dumps me, you're all I got.

When was the last time
you got a massage?

Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago

but that was just 'cause
there was a spider on his pillow

and he was trying to get away.

Leonard stood on me once, too.

But he was just trying to see
the Rose Parade.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

I don't know the protocol.

Are you gonna be naked
for your massage?

Yeah.

Then this is probably too many clothes.

- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

Came here to apologize.

Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that
but I need a little time to myself.

Okay, I don't get it.
You said make an effort,

here I am making an effort.

Hello, Amy. It's nice to see you.

Nice to see you, too.

And that's how you make effort
look effortless.

All right. Can you please just go
and we'll talk about this tomorrow?

- I don't understand what you want.
-l'm trying to figure it out.

If you'd like, I could whip up
a quick Relationship Agreement.

I'm at a spa.
Might as well do something relaxing.

Sheldon, why don't we
give them some privacy?

(SIGHS) Very well.

Hey, later, we'll check out the mini-bar.
I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.

So, what we did was
map out the entire room

to identify every squeak.

Watch. It's easy once you get
the hang of it. (CLEARS THROAT)

Step.

Step. (GRUNTS)

Hop on the ottoman.

Don't do that in socks.
I almost broke my neck.

Then simply sit, spin, stand.

Stretch...

(EXHALES)

(SIGHS) Maybe in looser pants.

Then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull
and you're there.

(SIGHS) Easy-peasy, mac and...
You get the idea.

You actually expect me to do this
while holding a baby in the dark?

Hold on.

I don't think she was impressed.

(PANTING) Bigger problems.
I felt something pop.

There's a cucumber in my water.

Uh-huh.

Do they know it's there?
(STAMMERS) Should I tell somebody?

It's there on purpose. It's refreshing.

Interesting.

The world's most boring liquid
and the world's most boring vegetable,

but you put them together and...
Bleh!

- Hey.
- Hey.

Oh, good, you're here.
Are you still fighting?

If you get divorced,
do I get two Christmases?

We're not getting divorced.

Listen, we realized that

we're facing some new challenges
as a married couple.

Yeah, and there are a few things
that we need to stay on top of

so we thought it would be useful...

I can't believe I am about to say this.
Um...

Would you please help us
make a Relationship Agreement?

But one that's tailored to us, okay?
We don't need a bathroom schedule.

Although, a rule about him texting me
from in there might help with the romance.

What do you say?

I get to write a contract?

I say, let's get this party
of the first part started.

(LAUGHING)

Whoo !! (CONTINUES LAUGHING)

You really think that's funny?

It's in our agreement, I have to laugh.

If you find this draft acceptable,
then I believe your new

Relationship Agreement
is ready to be signed.

"Article eight, subsection B.

"Leonard will restrict video gaming
in underpants to hours Penny is not home.

"This includes boxers, briefs,
thongs, G-strings

"or anything else that calls attention
to his pasty little thighs."

Does it really need to say that?

I did this for free,
let me get a little something.

"Article 10, subsection C.

"If questioned, Penny may not say that
everything is fine if it isn't.

"Other unacceptable responses include
'It's nothing,' 'Don't worry about it,'

"and 'I said it's nothing,
don't worry about it."'

Think this all looks good.

Me too.

Oh, well. Great, then. Here.

You sign here, date here,
and Penny, if you could initial here

to indicate that you're accepting
Leonard in "as is" condition.

I remember signing
our first Relationship Agreement.

Mmm, you seem to be forgetting
the "no nostalgia" clause.

Right, right. Got it.

English - SDH

What's going on
with that woman you're dating?

- I broke up with her.
- Why?

She said she didn't want to see me anymore
and I found that insulting.

I thought things were going well.
What happened?

I don't know.
She didn't even give me a reason.

That's not a problem,
we can figure this out.

What are the reasons women reject Raj?

RAJ: Look, can we not play this game?

Doesn't like games, that's one.

- Ignore him.
- Yeah, sorry about the breakup.

That's okay, I'm fine.

<i>SHELDON: Of course you're fine.</i>

Not every member of a species
finds a mate.

Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin,
look at the contributions he made.

I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.

So now you think you're better
than Isaac Newton?

No wonder women don't like you.

You're not being very nice.

SHELDON: What? He said he was fine.

Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

SHELDON: That's a paradox.

If you meant what you just said,

then that means you may not have meant
what you just said.

Careful, I saw this on Star Trek.
Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.

- Hey.
- Hey, boys. How's it goin'?

I thought we were having
a nice conversation,

but it turns out I was being offensive.

So, normal?

Sheldon, what did you do?

We were discussing Raj's recent breakup
and apparently I was insensitive to him.

It's okay, I'm fine.

You didn't-- Don't fall for it.

Now he'll get you to compare him
to a dead virgin,

and suddenly you're the bad guy.

Sheldon, when I said I was fine,

I meant I didn't wanna
talk about it anymore.

Then why didn't you say that?

Because that's not what people do.

Well, I would prefer if people told me
exactly what is on their mind.

No, no, you don't, you really don't.
I actually can't say "don't" enough.

Well, it certainly would be easier.

You have no idea what it's like

to struggle
with recognizing emotional cues.

- L'm sure it's extremely frustrating.
- Thank you.

And also a little sad.

Okay, now you're just showing off.

You know, ljust read that a team at MIT

developed a device
that helps people read human emotions.

And you think we can get those guys
to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.

It's supposed to be accurate,
like, 85% of the time.

Wow, I find that hard to believe.

That a bunch of awkward scientists
with no social skills

would invent a machine to do it for them?

I take it back, I believe it.

You know, if it's at MIT,
I can make some calls.

Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.

What do you think?

A machine that reads emotions
is intriguing.

It could help me be
a more considerate friend.

Wouldn't that be nice.

It could also help me identify my enemies,
discover their fears and then...

I could use those fears to destroy them.

I like the first one.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Now that Sheldon's across the hall,

have you decided what you're doing
with his old room?

I was thinking maybe a library
or a gaming room.

You could make it a train room.

I don't like trains, you like trains.

I know, and Amy says
I can't have a train room.

Sheldon, ljust heard from the guys at MIT
about that emotion reader.

They're sending a prototype
for you to beta test.

Wonderful.

Although, I'm not sure how I feel
about being used as a guinea pig.

Well, when you get the machine
you can find out.

Maybe I could use it to understand
why women keep dumping me.

Well, you don't need a machine for that.

Just send a survey card
to all your ex-girlfriends

and tell them if they fill it out
they might win a prize.

That's actually not a bad idea.

Maybe I could even get them all together,
sort of like a...

A focus group
to find out what's wrong with me.

No, Raj, that's a terrible idea.

Yeah, I was joking.

Really?

A little tip, jokes are often better

when you end them
with "wockawocka" or "ha-cha-cha."

Great news, the TV I want
will fit in the gaming room,

and if I leave the curtains open,
I can watch it from work.

Hey, can you hold off redoing that room?

My brother's comin' out here
in a few weeks.

Yeah, okay, sure.
What's going on with your brother?

My dad asked if I can get him
a job interview at my work.

Is that a good idea?

I mean, you think they'll consider someone
who was in prison for selling drugs?

Well, I sell pharmaceuticals.

Which is just a really
hard-to-spell word for drugs.

Well, I'm sure he'll appreciate

carrying his samples in a briefcase
instead of his colon.

How long do you think he'll stay?

I'm not sure. Maybe a few days.
Unless he gets the job, then who knows?

"Who knows?" That's exciting.

I'll get to wake up every morning
and see if he's still here.

You don't have a problem
with this, do you?

No, of course not.
I mean, he's your brother.

Okay, thank you. You're the best.

Remember that when the new TV

falls off the wall and crushes us both.
(CHUCKLES)

This thing's pretty cool.

It interprets emotions
using a wireless signal

to analyze subtle changes
in breathing and heart rate.

- It's amazing a machine can do that.
- SHELDON: Yes.

Now when the robots rise up,

they'll know that I've been
rooting for them the whole time.

The display is synced to your phone.

- Give it a try.
- All right.

Now I'm gonna look at some pictures
to prompt an emotional response

and we'll see if the machine
can identify them accurately.

Remember, it can only detect
happy, sad, angry and excited.

Not other things you're feeling,
like, "What have I done with my life?"

Okay, I'm looking at the first picture.

You are... Happy?

- Yes. I'm looking at puppies.
- Aw.

Okay. Somebody's ignoring
their tiny needle teeth, but all right.

- Try another one.
- Okay.

What does it say I'm feeling?

- Sad.
- Yes,

I'm looking at a picture of my grandma.

That makes sense.
'Cause she's gone and you miss her.

Yes.

And you're worried
that turkey neck is in your future.

See, now it says you're mad.
Make up your mind.

Okay, Emily, that sounds great.
See you then.

Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?

Yeah. I'm getting all my exes together
in order to discuss

why they broke up with me
and how I can be a better boyfriend.

Oh, God, you went through with that?
What is wrong with you?

We are going find out.

Why would you do that, Raj?

Well, I want information
in order to improve myself.

You're not gonna get information,

you're just gonna get criticism
that hurts your feelings.

Don't worry, I'm a grown man.
I have a thick skin.

- You're so stupid.
- Hey!

Hey, will you take a look
at my brother's rÃ©sumÃ©?

I'm trying to help him
clean it up a little.

Sure.

He really worked
with the Drug Enforcement Agency?

He didn't know it until he was cuffed,
but yeah.

Hey, Leonard,
if you're happy and you know it,

no need to clap your hands
because I have an emotion detector.

- How's it working out?
- Surprisingly well.

That's great, I'm happy for you.

Hold on.

What? You are. Aren't you sweet?

What's that?
Are you workin' on your rÃ©sumÃ©?

No, it's my brother's.
I'm tryin' to help him get a job out here.

Ooh, and that makes Leonard angry.

No, it doesn't.

(SCOFFS) Leonard, please.
I know an angry face when I see it.

It's this red frowny guy on my phone.

What? Are you really upset
about Randall coming?

- No!
- Yes.

- I said no.
- It's like you're twins.

Leonard, if you're mad about this,
just tell me.

Fine, you invited your drug dealer brother
to stay with us for God knows how long,

and didn't bother to ask me first.

He's my brother,
I didn't think I needed your permission.

Hey, now she's angry, too.

This thing works like gangbusters.

I'm not saying
you have to ask my permission,

but you could have talked to me about it
before you said it was okay.

Like you talked to me
about your gaming room?

Our gaming room!
I was gonna put a scented candle in it.

He's still mad.

Stop enjoying their fight.

You first.

If you were this upset, why didn't you
say so when I first told you?

Because I didn't wanna sound like a jerk.

Well, you sound like one now.

I don't see the big deal
if my brother comes and stays for a while.

If you get him a job,
he's gonna live here forever.

He would get his own place.

- Has he ever had his own place?
- Yes!

Did it have a metal toilet
next to the bed?

It still counts!

You know, how is this any different
from you making me live with Sheldon?

Hey! I shared
my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.

You gave me a bill
at the end of every month.

Stay out of this.

You and your stupid machine
started this fight.

(GASPS) You are lucky that this feelings
machine doesn't have feelings.

- Come on, Sheldon. Let's go.
- Gladly.

Can we storm out?

I think it loses its impact
if we're chatting about it.

Fine, I'll just give them the finger.

Okay, first off I want to thank you all
so much for coming.

Howard is here to interpret for Emily
and to take notes.

(INAUDIBLE)

No, he doesn't think it's stupid.

Heads up. Both of you are named Emily,

so we'll call you "Red-headed Emily,"

and you "Red-headed Emily Junior."

Hey, you went outwith him, I didn't.

Okay, let's get things started.

Why don't we go around the room,

say your name
and why you broke up with me.

Wanna kick it off?

Okay. Um...

I'm Lucy and I broke up with Raj
because I have severe social anxiety,

and he kept trying to force me
into uncomfortable situations.

Like this one?

Yeah.

I did do that. I can be insensitive
to other people's boundaries.

Howard, would you write that down?

"Schmuck." Got it.

Next?

Okay.

I'm Claire.

And I guess I broke up with you
because you were just really needy.

Also, you know, you were incredibly vain,

like, all the time you spend
shaping your eyebrows--

Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one.

Next?

I'm not sure I'm comfortable

sharing details about our relationship
in front of Howard.

He's here to support me,

so anything you have to say,
you can say in front of him.

Okay. Well,
whenever you and I were in bed--

Howard, get out.

Not a chance.

So, you were telling us
how Raj was terrible in bed.

Sheldon, dinner's ready.

I made beef-loaf

because I know you're uncomfortable
with the non-specificity of meatloaf.

Sheldon?

- Hey, are you okay?
- Not really.

What's going on?

I wish I never tried that device.

And I know I said the same thing
after the massage chair,

but this time I mean it.

I'm sorry Leonard and Penny
hurt your feelings.

It's more than that. It's me.

I always knew I had trouble
recognizing other people's emotions,

but that machine just made it so real.

Well, everybody has things
that they need help with.

Like me, I can't see without my glasses.

You know, right now you're just a...

A cute pink smudge
wearing a childish green smudge.

I thought I was getting better at it,
but clearly I'm not.

Yes, you are.

There have definitely been days
when I was sad and you could tell.

Yeah, but that's shooting
fish in a barrel.

You're kind of a sad sack.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I'm just upset.

See, right there.

You knew you hurt my feelings.

And I'm proud of you for reasons I'm sure
have something to do with my father.

And if you don't like that machine,
get rid of it.

Because I love you
exactly the way you are.

I feel the same way about you.

Now put your glasses back on,
you look weird.

"L thought you were great,
but, oh, my God,

"you were so dominated by your parents."

Yeah, that used to drive me nuts.
He's kind of a mama's boy.

- Kind of?
- Okay, that's enough.

Write down "loving son."

Can ljust say something?

Going out with Raj

was one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

Yes, I'll take you back.

Let me finish.

It's like I needed
to go through that experience

to know what exactly
I don't want in a man.

Well, that's hard to hear,
but I'll still take you back.

You know, the same thing happened to me.

After I broke up with Raj,
I met Gary who's just amazing.

Sorry, is that Gary with one "R" or two?

Would you stop writing?

Wait, so, did all of you
go on to better relationships after me?

- Oh, yeah.
- Without question.

Little before, actually.

Oh.

Wow. Don't let him get away.

Wait. What did she say?

Basically, she traded you
for a Bruce Wayne.

Okay. Maybe we should just end this.

Well, hang on.

I just want to point out to everyone here,

this is a man who is going
to great lengths to better himself.

Even at the risk of being humiliated.
And I, for one, think that's very brave.

Thank you, Howard.

Honestly, I'm surprised
you two didn't wind up together.

Well, like you gals,

I had to suffer through him
to find Bernadette.

(COOING)

- Yes?
- We owe you an apology.

It's fine. You needed a suitcase,
I wasn't home, you borrowed a suitcase.

That was six years ago.
I'm talking about tonight.

Oh.

I thought we were going in order.

Look, we got really angry at each other

and you just got caught
in the middle of it.

And sorry about the suitcase.

Yeah, well, you should be.

Your socks were still in it.
I had to throw it away.

Anyway, I trust
that you've resolved your conflict?

- Yes, we're fine.
- Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him

it's not a good time for Randall to visit.

Hopefully, he won't be too upset.

You're his little girl,
he can't stay mad at you.

He won't be mad at me.

I mean, you're the one
who doesn't want my brother to come. So...

So you're gonna throw me under the bus?

Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard,
I might actually win a stuffed animal.

Guys, it sounds
like you're getting angry again.

- That's because we are.
- Yes!

I don't need an emotion machine, lam one!

Thanks, ladies, this was fun!

Let's not wait so long
for another bizarre, awkward night.

That was a waste of time.
I'm such an idiot.

Don't beat yourself up.
That's what I'm here for.

Maybe I won't settle down.
Maybe I'll just play the field.

Yeah, the field was just here.
The field said no.

Dude, come on.

Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

Thirty years from now,
if you're still single

and things don't work out
with me and Bernadette,

you and I can give it a go.

I appreciate the offer,
but if things don't work out with you two,

I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.

Too late. Stuart called dibs.

But, theoretically,

if you and I were in a gay relationship,

how would we tell people?
Like, print up announcements?

I don't know.
What difference does it make?

Well, I wanna make sure
we get invited to all the parades.

Those do look fun.

Yeah. Well,

if you wanna march in a fishnet crop-top
you better lay off that dip.

If you didn't want me to eat it,
Why'd you put it out?

It was for the girls. They broke up
with me, I don't care if <i>they</i> get fat.

I'm not gonna get fat.

You wanna bet? You never exercise.

Fine. Look, I'll exercise right now.

One.

Two.

These are crunches, by the way.

Very mature. Keep eating like that,
you're gonna have a heart attack.

Okay. How about if I eat like this?

(MOANS SENSUALLY)

You're such a child!

Hey, is that any way
to talk to your future husband?

Hey. I was being hypothetical, okay?
I would never marry you.

Please. When you see the ring I pick out,
you're gonna melt.

Yeah, right.

Wait, is it rose gold?

Actually, don't tell me.
I wanna be surprised.

So, did you wind up
sending that machine back?

I did. You know, I'm not even sure
how accurate it was.

I took it to the train store.
It said everyone was sad.

I finally got Halley to sleep.

You know, ljust read a study
that suggests new mothers are better

-at sensing emotions for up to two years.
- It's true.

Pregnancy causes physiological changes
in the brain

that result in increased empathy.

Oh! So all we need to do
is get Sheldon knocked up.

We can't, he was already fixed
when I found him at the shelter.

Hey, Bernadette, let's test this theory.
What do you think I'm feeling right now?

Let's see. You're better than us,
a little bit sorry for us,

but mostly glad you don't have to be us.

Keep filling this one with babies,
she's good.

English - SDH

Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic
flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.

Nicely done, Howard.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Well, my wife
is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied,

so clearly I know my way
around tiny things.

Good for you.
On the cutting edge of new technology,

and still making inappropriate comments
about the mother of your child.

Those are just the things I say out loud.

Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.

- What's wrong?
-l'm looking at the math,

and I think we can make the device
between eight and 10% smaller.

That's great, but the Air Force
approved the specs. We're good to go.

Yeah, it doesn't need to be smaller.

Shame on you.

(STUTTERS) Where would we be
if poodle breeders had that attitude?

I'll tell you. We'd have the standard
and the miniature poodle,

but no toy or teacup.

Which, by the way,
is not an officially recognized breed,

but that's just poodle politics.

Can we please stop talking about poodles?

Fine. Candy bars.

Now do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.

Sheldon, we don't need
to make this smaller.

Your work is done. Go home.

I don't wanna go home.

- Fine, go for a little walk.
- Then what?

Just keep walking.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

At least it's quiet
when he takes bathroom breaks.

(SIGHS) I know.

That's why I keep refilling his water
when he's not looking.

(CHUCKLES) You're kidding.

I don't care if we're in a drought,
it's worth it.

You know, I... I do have a way
to get him out of our hair.

I've been holding on to this
for a few years,

but maybe now's the time.

We can just look the door,
you don't have to kill him.

You can't kill him,
he'll just respawn at the last save point.

Oh.
That was my sixth trip to the bathroom.

As long as it's not
a urinary tract infection,

that's a personal best.

Hey, uh, buddy,
I got you a little present.

- Really? (CLICKS TONGUE)
- Yeah, yeah. Go ahead, open it.

"Congratulations. The bearer
of this certificate

"is entitled
to the ultimate train experience

"at The Nevada Northern Railway.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

"You are at the throttle.
You are the engineer.

"You are running the locomotive."
(GASPS)

This doesn't happen very often,
but here comes a hug. (CHUCKLES)

Oh, dear! I have to tinkle again.

Okay, where were we?

For Howie's occupation,
should I include that he was an astronaut?

Well, he mentioned it
in his mother's eulogy,

so why not?

I can't believe you have to fill out
a preschool application for an infant.

Uh, the one at Caltech
has a crazy wait list.

I warned you, a lot of people apply
when they're still pregnant.

Well, I didn't.

I also skipped a birthing class
to see <i>Zootopia,</i> so back off.

Whoa, just trying to help.

Sorry. Howie's back at work
and there's just so much going on.

Is there anything we can do?

Sure. Open up a college fund,
shop for life insurance

and in the laundry room,
there's a mountain of dirty laundry.

Wash it or burn it. Your choice.

(BABY CRYING)

-(SIGHS) Be right back.
- No, no. I will take care of it.

Thank you.

While I'm gone, you can think about
how mean you were to me.

All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.

You know, where you can
just kind of relax and--

-(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)
- Okay, I'm just gonna turn this off.

Much better. (CLEARS THROAT)

Seriously, let's plan a night, you know,
give you a break. We could go dancing.

That sounds really nice.

Oh. All this week,
the Early Music Society of Pasadena

is doing a joint concert
with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.

Okay, that's the one to beat.

Good luck. People have been saying that
for 600 years.

Hey. You're home early.

You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift.

A trip to a historic railway

and I get to operate an actual locomotive.

Wow. He finally used it? What'd you do?

<i>No</i> idea. All I know is

I'm gonna be working on the railroad
all the livelong day.

Well, I'm really happy for you.

Oh, no, it's not just me.

(STUTTERS) The railway is four hours
from the nearest airport,

and guess who gets to drive me?

- I give up.
- You!

No, I really give up.

Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep.

Our choice of a turn-of-the-century
railway bunkhouse

or a working caboose!

Now, the problem with the caboose
is there's no bathroom.

But the problem with the bunkhouse
is it's not a caboose.

On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.

On the second day, a diesel engine.

Oh, and if I volunteer to do
track maintenance and paperwork,

They'll let me stay as long as I want.

You might want to pack enough clothes
for the rest of our lives.

Can I pee now?

Oh, get this.

I get to take a test
based on 125-page manual.

(GASPS)
I get to learn things like hand signals.

Whoa, there's forward, reverse,
set the brakes.

Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.

Oh, this is good.

There are dozens of railroad crossings
you have to blow the whistle for.

That is the figurative "you,"
not the literal "you."

I'll be blowing the whistle.

Amy, get up. It's time to go to work.

(SIGHS)

This train thing worked out
better than I thought.

- He's home studying the engineer's manual.
-(SIGHS)

It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?

Four thousand dollars, worth every penny.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Gentlemen.

- Oh, sir.
- Colonel Williams.

Just wanted to see
how the guidance system's coming along.

Great. We found a cooling solution

that allowed us to get the size
of the prototype down to the target specs.

As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
(CHUCKLES)

Don't do that.

What's this?

Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.

This is a different approach.

Are you trying to get the guidance system
even smaller?

It's just a theory.
It's not even worked out.

On. (CHUCKLES)

I want this.

But we've already met
the agreed-upon specs.

Going smaller would require
weeks' worth of new computations.

So get the kid with the two shirts
to do it.

(STAMMERING) Sir, if I may,

we've put a lot of thought and effort
into this current prototype.

It's a really elegant solution
and most importantly, it works.

Yeah, I want this.

Okay, but that's just a theory.

It's not even a complete thought.
(CHUCKLES)

You both make excellent points.

Thank you for presenting it
so articulately.

(CHUCKLES) Make this.

(DOOR CLOSES)

The kid with the two shirts
screwed us again.

All right. You guys ready to get crazy?

Well, the bra under here ain't beige.

Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.

Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.

Oh, under the careful supervision
of her godfather.

My apologies.
Didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.

Like I said, you ladies have fun.

We will. Got my dancing shoes,
got my breast pump. Let's party.

You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.

Call if there's any problems.

- No. She's busy, you call Howard.
- Uh, got it.

Call me, don't call Howard.

Hey, I would never call Howard.

Okay, instead of arguing all night,

let's just split up the baby chores.

Yeah, great.
Um, I'll put food in her top half,

you deal with
whatever comes out the bottom.

(SIGHS)

I can't believe we have to ask
Sheldon to come back and help us.

Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift
that only got rid of him for an afternoon.

(CRACKLING)

What is that?

I don't know,
but if he yells, "It's alive!" we run.

Oh, hey.

If you knocked I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.

And if you didn't knock,
how about some manners?

How'd you even get that up the stairs?

I said to myself,
"I think I can, I think I can."

And then I couldn't.

So I paid two men
who promised not to come rob us later.

Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us
to make the guidance system smaller

-and we can't do it without you.
-(SIGHS)

Interesting.

Well, so I was right.

Open a window,
it's about to get smug in here.

Well, I would love to help you,
but since I discovered the satisfaction

of working with my hands
on a train engine,

I don't think I can go back to theory.

I'm an engineer now.

And, hey, just to be clear,
a train engineer.

Not that goofy kind you are.

Sheldon, you can still go
on the trip in a few weeks.

Just help us out.

Sorry, I need to work on this engine,

so when I get to the train yard,
I won't look foolish.

(LAUGHS)
He's worried about looking foolish.

That's a heaping helping
of irony right there.

(SIGHS)

Come on, you know
you're not leaving physics.

Why are you doing this?

Leonard, in the world
of theoretical physics, you never finish.

So much is unprovable.

But when I was studying
that railway guide,

it was so tangible and so satisfying,

that something just clicked.

Then it clacked.

Then it clicked,
then it clacked, click-clack,

clickety-clack and here we are.

Whoo-whoo!

Hey. Did you hear anything back
from the Caltech preschool?

Not yet, but we're gonna apply
to a bunch of others

just to keep our options open.

Okay. Stop that! No more preschool talk.
Tonight is about having fun.

Nothing says fun like being scolded.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Uh-oh, it's Raj. Everything okay?

Don't worry, everything's fine.

Hang up, we don't need help.

I don't need your help
deciding when we need help.

Raj, what's going on?

So, I was just warming up
some milk for Halley,

and I thought the milk smelled
a little funky,

so I checked the date that you wrote
on the bottle and it says "Flerbsday."

It says Tuesday.

How is that a "T"?

I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried
there's extra milk in the freezer.

<i>RAJ". Okay, yes.</i>

I will err on the side of caution
and defrost a fresh batch.

You're wasting perfectly good milk.

- Fine, you drink it.
- It's just milk.

Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

Okay. Can you guys handle this or not?

Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time. (CHUCKLES)

She said I was in charge.

(RAJ CLEARS THROAT)

-(SIGHS)
- So we just throw this away?

What else are you gonna do with it,
put it in your coffee?

Well, I don't take it black.

Okay, this is everything he had
on the board.

- L'm sure we can figure the rest out.
- All right. (CLEARS THROAT)

Hmm.

Feel free to jump in. "Hmm" is all I got.

- We can get this.
-(SIGHS)

ls there any chance it's upside down?

Maybe we can find
another theoretical physicist to help us.

It's classified.
If we tell anyone we'd get in trouble.

Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.

Just keep thinking.

I got it.

You really figured it out?

No.

But when we show this nonsense
to Sheldon,

it will make him crazy
and he'll have to fix it.

- Oh, you're a genius.
- Yeah, I know.

Uh, that's not even a math symbol,
that's just Charlie Brown's hair.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Sorry, guys. This club was so great.

How could they turn it into a bookstore?

I thought we got rid of all those.

Renaissance choir's looking
pretty good right now, huh?

-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-(CLICKS TONGUE)

Hello?

- Nothing to worry about.
-(BABY CRYING)

She's just been crying for a little while,

and I was wondering
if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.

She was sleeping just fine
until you took a selfie with her.

She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!

You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?

(WHISPERS)
Wait, wait. She's settling down.

-(BABY STOPS CRYING)
- Oh, okay, false alarm.

Little parenting tip,
sleeping babies hate flash photography.

- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

I may have just left my infant daughter
with Patrick and SpongeBob.

Hey, there's another dance club nearby.

I mean, I don't know how you feel
about Latin music,

but according to their horas of operaciÃ©n,
they're open.

Maybe we should just call it a night.

You sure? They're open till dos.

Yeah, we're all dressed up, why go home?

I'm just not really in the mood anymore.

What's going on with you?

I don't know, this is all starting to feel
like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.

I'm not sad. I just wanted to get drunk
and not wear sweatpants.

I'm not sad. I mean, hello. (CHUCKLES)

Okay, well, maybe I'm the one who's sad.

What are you sad about?

Maybe the fact
that you went and had a baby.

You're upset I had a baby?

No, of course not. ljust...

I didn't think it would make me
have all these feelings.

What feelings?

Pressure!

I mean, she's looking at preschools,
she has a minivan, she has a 401 (k).

Before she talked about it,
I just thought that was a race.

You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.

I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired,
and, in a few minutes,

I'm going to milk myself
in a bookstore parking lot.

I get that, okay?

It's just, Leonard and I
have been married for two years

and we're no further along
than when we were dating.

Come on.
You've got so much to feel good about.

You've got a great job now.

Yeah, I guess. I am making decent money.

You make more than I do.

You may not have a house yet,
but your apartment's great.

It's bigger than mine.

And Leonard loves you so much,
he married you twice.

I'm not even engaged once.

I don't even know
if Sheldon thinks about marriage.

Not gettin' any younger.

Honestly, I kind of thought by now
we might have had some sort of--

Careful. The sound of crying
can make me lactate.

I'm sorry, I can't help it. (CRIES)

Aw, that's gonna make me cry. (CRIES)

And there they go.

Ew.

(HAMMERING)

Well, Sheldon,
turns out we didn't need you after all.

HOWARD: That's right, we figured it out
all by ourselves.

- Wasn't even that hard.
- No.

Oh, good for you, guys.

Look, I have grease smudge on my hand
and I'm okay with it.

Aren't you gonna look at the board
to see how right we are?

No, thanks,
I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.

It's a manifold.

Oh.

Well, I guess it's fixed.

- Just look at the board.
- That's wrong.

Oh, no.

What should we have done differently?

Well, first of all,

you can't use relativistic
and non-relativistic vectors

in the same equation.

Told you. (SCOFFS)

Can you fix it for us?

(SIGHS)

Okay, but this is the last time.

Nice try, blackheads.

Come on, Sheldon,
you can't turn your back on physics.

Besides, you have no idea
what you're doing with this stuff.

But if you really want to learn
the mechanical side,

I can teach you anything you wanna know.

(STUTTERS)
And instead of standing around watching,

you can help us build
your smaller guidance system.

And with all these new skills,
you'd be able to fix any model train.

You'd be the king of the train store.

Excuse me, I have a girlfriend.
I'm already king of the train store.

So what do you say?

Oh, what choice do I have? You need me.

I'm like the crankshaft of this team.

That's a turbo.

Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.

I'm gonna need you two to get it
downstairs before Amy comes home.

(STEAM HISSING)

(HORN HOOTING)

I apologize it is so warm in here.

It is warm in here.

(PANTS) I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

Me, too.

May I borrow your water?

<i>SHELDON". The light's green.</i>

Sorry.

GPS says we'll be at the railway
in three hours.

I can get us there in two.

(REVVING)

"Go!

- Come on, Raj!
- LEONARD: You can do <i>this!</i>

- There's no way.
- What is happening?

Okay, this is an Euler's Disk.

It's a physics toy that demonstrates

angular momentum, potential energy
and kinetic energy.

Oh, look at you watching sports.

We're betting to see if Koothrappali

can hold his breath
longer than the disk can spin.

Yeah, its weight and smoothness,

along with the slight concavity
of the mirror

means it can spin for a long time.

But Raj is from India, well, which means

he's no slouch at holding his breath.

Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I'll lose
interest before that thing stops spinning.

Hey, Sheldon, I found
a great restaurant for date night.

(STAMMERS) Kind of busy right now.

Oh, an Euler's Disk, fun.

Now we're seeing if Raj
can hold his breath longer than it.

Oh, immature.

How you doing?

-(RAJ MUMBLING)
- He's not gonna make it!

Yes, he is!

You know, deep sea divers
holding their breath

for several minutes have shown
elevated markers of a protein

that can signal brain damage.

Yeah, see, what's happening here
signals brain damage.

Oh, my God,
how long does this thing spin for?

Ah! You're interested,
you're out 10 bucks!

It's slowing down!

Dig deep! Like when they bet
you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!

(GROANING)

- He's not gonna make it!
- Yes, he is!

Come on, Raj!
It's like your favorite movie,

you're just waiting to exhale!

- Yeah!
- I knew you could do it!

(PANTING) And just so you know,

my favorite movie is Princess Bride.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(DIALING)

<i>Hello, Rajesh, how are things by you?</i>

Good, good.

Uh, listen, ljust wanted to let you know

when you get my credit card bill,

it might be a little high this month.

<i>Well, you're</i> a <i>grown man
with</i> a <i>steady job,</i>

<i>why wouldn't you spend
all your father's money.</i>

(LAUGHING) Oh, Daddy,
you're so rich and funny.

<i>Yeah, so what else is
going on with your life?</i>

Uh, well, I was dating a woman at
the university but we broke up.

<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

I know you are.
That's why you just bought me a new iPad.

And before you start, I am not interested
in you arranging a marriage for me.

<i>Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.</i>

You did?

<i>It's too much work.</i>

<i>You're an adult who can't get by
without an allowance from his parents.</i>

<i>Women don't want that.</i>

What are you saying,
that you're giving up on me?

What kind of father gives up on his son?

<i>I have six children,</i>

<i>five of whom are married
and self-sufficient,</i>

<i>I don't think I'm the problem.</i>

I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This is deeply hurtful!

<i>You're also too sensitive,
women don't want that, either.</i>

The food here is supposed to be great.
Don't fill up on chips.

Oh, I won't, I have a trick.

I only eat equilateral triangles.

Isosceles... isosceles...

Oh, scalene...

You didn't see that.

Oh, look, it's Bert at the bar.
We should go say hi.

<i>Why'?</i>

Because that's what you do when you
see someone you know in a public place.

I have multiple restraining orders
that say otherwise.

Sheldon, there's a difference
between greeting a friend

and following a celebrity into a bathroom.

If the judge couldn't explain it to me,
I don't see how you will.

- Hi, Bert.
- Hello.

Oh, hey, guys, what brings you here?

Oh, we're having date night.

Nice, I'm meeting someone, too.

Oh, really, anybody we know?

I doubt it, I met her on G-Harmony.

That's a website for geologists
to find love.

That's a real thing?

Yeah, their slogan is,

"We're all about dating,
and not the Carbon-14 kind."

Well, have a lovely evening.

Thanks. You, too.

If you think that's more fun
than talking to Zachary Quinto

through a stall door, you're crazy.

You know we could've come to you guys,
you didn't have to bring the baby here.

It's okay,
it's good to get out of the house.

And the car ride puts her to sleep.

Aw... That used to work with Sheldon.

Yeah, until someone left him in the
drug store parking lot and he freaked out.

Who forgot to crack the window?

- Hello.
- LEONARD: Hey.

Someone's been shopping at Gucci.

Yeah, I saw something for Halley
and I couldn't resist.

That's so sweet of you.

Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.

Oh, no, now we have two.

That must've been expensive.

Yeah, it was, but it's my father's money
and I'm mad at him.

- What's going on with your dad?
- And, if you really wanna hurt him,

I look great in Chanel. (CLEARS THROAT)

It turns out he doesn't care
if I'm married, or if I'm single.

He's basically given up on me.

Aw, I'm sure that's not true.

It is. He stopped trying to
find Indian girls for me to marry.

But all you did was complain
when he did that.

Wait, Leonard, he's hurting,
let him feel how he feels.

Well, thank you, Penny.

Yeah. Shoes, I'm a seven and a half,
boots I'm an eight.

MSN Search,

AltaVista,

and Ask Jeeves. You?

Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct
search engines that I miss.

Hey, looks like I got stood up,
so, I'm gonna head out.

Oh, no. Are you sure you don't wanna
give her a few more minutes?

Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours,
it's time to cut bait.

I'm so sorry.

Bert, I insist that you join us.

You really wouldn't mind?

Not at all. Amy?

Fine with me.

Thanks, I'll go grab a chair.

Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.

I could deduce by his facial expression
and body language that he was sad.

So, the part where he got stood up
didn't clue you in?

You want me to look at him
and listen to him?

My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

is because I'm spoiled.

I'm sorry, is he waiting
for someone to disagree?

Just because he helps me out,

doesn't automatically
mean that I'm spoiled.

All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

Okay, I'll tell you
but please don't judge me.

He pays for my car,
my rent and my credit cards.

I'm trying, but I'm judging.

Maybe your dad's right.

Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

But Bernadette makes
more money than Howard.

She basically supports him.

Yeah, maybe your dad's right.

Good question, let's see,

lnfoseek, Webcrawler, oh, Hotbot.

Okay, literally any other topic.

All right, how did you guys meet?

Actually, we met online.

Our first date was at a coffee shop.

Although, unlike your date,
she actually showed up.

Oh, he looks sad again.

Well, I really envy your relationship.

Other than you two only
having sex once a year,

you're the perfect couple.

You know about that?

Yeah, everyone at the university does.

Were you aware of this?

No! No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,

Kripke, Professor Woo, Professor Klein,

and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.

Wait, how everyone else found out
is a mystery to me.

Why aren't you talking to me?

Because I'm mad at you.

Oh, well, now I'm sorry I asked.

Sheldon, it's humiliating!

Thanks to you, my colleagues
are gossiping about our sex life.

Well, what is there to gossip about?
We barely have one!

That's why they're doing it!

Is it safe to assume
you're not speaking to me again?

If you're not answering because
you're not speaking to me,

-perhaps we could come up with a signal!
-(DOOR SLAMS)

That works!

You don't need your dad's money.

You can get by on your salary.

Yeah, well, we worked
at the same place as you

and we've always been fine.

Oh, please, look in the mirror,

you both look 10 years older than I do.

All right, hang on,
we can figure this out.

Let's just go over your expenses.
How much is your rent?

(CLICKS TONGUE) I don't want to say.

Is it really that high?

I don't wanna say because
I don't know how much it is.

You don't know how much your rent is?

Well, my father pays for it!
Do you know how much your rent is?

- Yeah!
- Well then, double it,

because my building's
a lot nicer than this dump.

- Do you know how much your car costs?
- Not really.

Well, how much do you spend on food?

The housekeeper does the shopping.

Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.

I'm spoiled?
Your baby has a cape that costs $300!

I'm going to bed.

Well, wait,

this is our first fight as
a couple who live together.

So?

Well, I'm not sure of the protocol.

Television teaches us that the man
is supposed to sleep on the couch.

But, of the two of us,
you're clearly more sofa-sized.

I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you
don't know what's private and what's not.

This isn't fair.

You've discussed aspects of our
physical relationship with Penny.

That's different!

She's a close friend,
not the lady in the cafeteria

who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.

That lady has a name.

I don't know what it is, but one time
I accidentally called her mom.

It sounds like you're gonna
need a cheaper place to live.

When you moved here you didn't have
a lot of money, how'd you get by?

Well, sometimes you can get free food
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

Just know you might have to
marry one of them.

Hey, you guys let Stuart
live with you, why not Raj, too?

What are you doing?
I...

I schlepped the baby over, I brought
imported beer, why don't you like me?

But I thought we were best friends!

No, we are! That's why I'm sad
my best friend's gonna be homeless.

I'm sorry, Raj.
We really just don't have the space.

What if he lives in your garage?

What if you stop helping?

Guys, I'm not living in a garage.

Wait, well why are we
talking about our place

when Sheldon's old room is
sitting there perfectly empty?

That's a great idea.

Raj, if you need a place to stay,
of course you are welcome here.

Thank you, but if I'm gonna just
take advantage of my friends,

might as well keep on
relying on my father.

Okay, only if you're sure.

- Phew.
- Yeah.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR RHYTHMICALLY)

<i>SHELDON". Amy. Amy. Amy.</i>

Yeah?

Not exactly the welcome wagon,
but I'll take it.

What is this?

I'm mapping basic topics of conversation

and with whom they can be discussed.

Now, I call these circles
"Zones of Privacy."

Don't google that unless you want
to see pictures of people's genitals.

This circle contains only me and you.

And it represents subjects that
we only share with each other,

details of physical intimacy,
bathroom habits...

Although, as I'm saying it I may
need to add Dr. Fink in here.

Are you really worried about
revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?

No, I was just excited
to list him as a friend.

Well, I do appreciate you working on this.

I'm sorry you were embarrassed,

and now I understand that some things
are just between you and me,

and in the event of redness
and swelling, Dr. Fink.

What's that little clot in the middle?

That's reserved for thoughts
I don't share with anyone.

Interesting.

You really have secrets you don't tell me?

Of course.

Can I hear one?

<i>No</i>, they're private.

Why, are they naughty?

A little.

Please?

Fine. Two years ago...

I got my driver's license.

What? Why didn't you say anything?

Well, I like being chauffeured around.

It makes me feel important.

So, when I got up at 4:00 a.m.
to drive you across the desert

to an antique train museum,
I didn't have to?

No, you didn't.

But keep in mind,
I felt extremely important.

(DIALING)

<i>What?</i>

Hello, Father, we need to talk.

<i>All right.</i>

I have come to an important decision.

I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

I'm a man and I can take care of myself.

<i>That's wonderful!</i>

Yes, that is wonderful,

you will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled.

<i>- L'm</i> so proud of you.
- Dad, I'm trying to tell you off

and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

<i>Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son</i>

<i>is going to stop spending all my money,</i>

<i>where did I fail as a father?</i>

Yeah, that's right,
keep asking yourself that!

But I still love you very much,
so don't cut me out of the will.

Hey, you brought your own lunch,
good for you.

Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.
This morning I fired my dog walker.

How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?

Ah, I gave her an Imodium.
That's tomorrow's problem.

Excuse me,
may I have your attention, please.

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

I have recently been made aware

that my personal relationship
with Amy Farrah Fowler

has become water cooler gossip.

And ljust want to say
shame on all of you.

Now, we're scientists.

Our minds should be focused on
the advancement of human knowledge,

not the intimate details
of other people's lives.

He's right. And I'm sorry
for the part I played in this.

Thank you, Bert. You're a good man.

That woman who stood you up and humiliated
you last night really missed out.

That doesn't paint me in the best light.

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Correction.

That woman not only had
vigorous coitus with Bert

but she also tipped him
a dollar for a job well done.

- That better?
- Not really.

All right, well to sum up,
focus on science,

keep your nose
out of other people's business

and for a good time, call Bert.

What brought that on?

Well, last night Amy was angry with me

because I'd been foolishly telling people
about certain personal matters.

That's understandable.

I know that now.

At first I thought she was cranky
because of her horrific menstrual cramps,

but it turns out no,
she was genuinely mortified.

Okay, I'll tell you
but please don't judge me.

He pays for my car,

(CLICKS TONGUE) Interesting.

Okay.

How bad is it?

Uh, let me put it this way,
do you own a barrel and suspenders?

Are you serious?

I'm not wearing this visor
to play women's golf.

Hi.

Oh, let me guess, you guys are drafting
your fantasy accounting firms.

We're helping Raj figure out his finances.

Aw, he has a job. How bad can it be?

Well, his rent and car lease
are exceedingly high.

You couple that with his penchant for
dining out and shopping--

Wait, wait, not shopping for
clothes, right? Because look.

He also has a remarkable amount
of credit card debt.

L... I thought your dad paid your cards.

I have a card for emergencies
that I pay for myself.

What emergency happened at the LA Zoo?

That's a penguin I sponsor.

They're losing their homes
to global warming,

and my car gets, like,
seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.

What is "Pink Cheeks"?

It's intimate waxing.
Quit looking at that!

Maybe you should find someone to
help you get your finances under control.

Like a business manager?

Oh, absolutely not.

You can't afford to hire someone
who will forbid you

from spending your money
on foolish expenses.

That is a foolish expense,
and I forbid it.

What if there's someone who just likes
controlling other people

and stealing joy from their lives?

He sounds like a sociopath.

We don't know,
his mother never had him tested.

You're talking about me. Very funny.

Although, I would enjoy
drawing up a budget

and forcing Raj to adhere to it
without an ounce of compassion.

Wait, wait, who's gonna break it
to the penguin?

Okay, Sheldon.

Yeah, I'm putting you in charge
of my finances.

I will not spend another penny
that you don't authorize.

Very well.

Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale
this Friday, you can't buy one.

Better luck next time, pink cheeks.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

You're actually going to Comic-Con?

Well, Leonard wants me to do
more stuff like that with him,

so I thought maybe this year
I'd tag along.

Well, that's sweet. I bet you'll have fun.

So, do you wanna come?

No, thanks. I already live in a place
all the nerds come to.

Please? I went to your boring thing
last month.

My aunt's funeral?

Come on, even you checked your email
during the eulogy.

Well, I'm not going,
but I do think it's nice you want to.

It's not that I want to go,
ljust think it'll make Leonard happy.

And if I have to watch him squeeze into
an Ewok costume, so be it.

Look at you, going to Comic-Con,
talking about Ewoks.

I really have become the cool one
around here.

You actually think Penny will have fun
at Comic-Con?

No, which will make me miserable,
which is usually Sheldon's job.

She's gonna hate waiting in line
for the panels.

And hate all the crowds at the panels.

She's gonna hate the panels.

She's gonna hate how often
we say the word "panels."

Why don't you just tell her not to come?

Oh, she's so excited.
I can't do that to her.

Well, what if you make it sound so bad,
she won't wanna go?

That I would do to her.

I can't believe Penny is gonna get to go
and I'm not.

You can always watch the panels online.

Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.

Panels.

Just wanted to be included.

Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con!

Just let me have the money for this,
and I won't ask for anything else.

You put me in charge of your finances.

If you wanted someone weak and spineless
you could walk all over,

you should have asked Leonard.

See? Miserable.

Okay, you're right,
I got myself into this.

But I've never missed a Comic-Con
with you guys.

Your father may have spoiled you,
but I won't.

Now, if you want a ticket to Comic-Con,

I suggest you figure out a way
to earn the money yourself.

Yeah, you're a grown man
who's highly educated.

Uh, you could charge people money
to punch you.

Go ahead, make jokes.

I don't know why you think you're going
to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.

- So?
- What-- So?

What, so you think Bernadette's
just gonna let you

jet down to San Diego for five days
and leave her alone?

(STAMMERING) Hang on.

So, I have to bring Penny,

you can't afford it,
Howard's gonna get in trouble,

and this guy gets to have a great time.

I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.

- How's my favorite girl?
- Okay.

- What you doing?
- Making lasagna.

Mmm! She's sexy, she can cook.
Such a lucky guy. (LAUGHS)

You want something stupid
or you did something stupid?

No! ljust walked in here,

saw how beautiful you are,
and had to tell you.

Oh, dear God,
you're cheating on me with Raj.

(HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHING) Never gets Old.

Okay, there is something I want,
but it's not a big deal.

What is it?

Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale
this Friday,

and I was hoping I could go with the guys.

But before you say anything,

I'll make up for being gone
by doing everything around here.

I mean, everything.
I'm even gonna answer for you.

"Yes, Howie, you can go."

It's so hard to say no to you.

Thank you!

So I'll say "maybe."

What? Why?

Well, you said tickets don't go on sale
till Friday, right?

Yeah?

You said you're gonna do
all this stuff for me, right?

Yeah.

See where I'm going with this?

Yeah.

If you don't know how to make lasagna,
Google does.

Okay, so, this is the
main Comic-Con floor.

It's where all the vendors
and exhibits are.

Wow! That is a lot of people
jammed in there.

I know!

Sometimes, Howard wears a striped shirt
so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"

Okay, now, this is us camping out
in line for the Avengers panel.

Oh, you really
sleep on the sidewalk, huh? (LAUGHS)

Yeah. It can get chilly,

but, uh, Raj figured out that
if you pee in a bottle

and put it in your sleeping bag,
it helps keep you warm.

Here's the hotel room we all share.

Well, you and I would
get our own room, right? (LAUGHS)

Every hotel is booked.

But see this space here,
between Sheldon's feet and my head?

That's where you go.

Well, it's no different than

when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us
during a thunderstorm.

Don't worry, we won't be doing
much sleeping, anyway.

It's like an all-night party.

There's trivia contests
and Dungeons & Dragons.

As we like to say,
"It's off the chain mail."

I even said "off the chain mail!"
And she still wants to go.

That's probably my fault.

She may have heard about
my cool Dumbledore costume.

Okay, I can give you 20 bucks
for the whole box.

But you charged me hundreds
for this stuff!

I know. And I did it with a straight face.

(SIGHS) But I need to earn enough money
so I can go to Comic-Con.

All right.

I'll give you 25 bucks,
that's my best offer.

I have no choice.

You know, if you wanna make extra money,
I could throw some work your way.

- Really? I'll do anything.
- Great, you're hired.

First thing you can do
is put price tags on these.

Start the little ones at $50.

You know, it's no big deal.
I can put up with anything for three days.

- Comic-Con's five days.
- Are you kidding me?

(SIGHS)

Why don't you just tell him
you don't wanna go?

<i>No</i>, I can't, it'll break his heart.

He's always making an effort
to do things with me he doesn't enjoy.

Like going outside.

He is an indoor cat.

Maybe it won't be that bad.

Leonard says it's really mainstream now.

Comic books aren't just
for sad nerds anymore.

I mean, it is still
a key part of their demographic.

<i>BERNADETTE". Howie, can you get that?</i>

<i>HOWARD". Kinda busy!</i>

<i>BERNADETTE: Busy like I'll be
with the baby if you go to San Diego?</i>

(FOOTSTEPS RUSHING)

- Hey.

What's with the gloves?

They complete my ensemble.
What do you want?

I'm looking to make extra money,

and was wondering if you had any chores
I could do.

Hang on.

Bernie, can I outsource my chores
to an Indian guy?

<i>BERNADETTE'. No!</i>

I tried.

Hey, I was thinking,
if you wanna do a couples costume,

we could paint ourselves green
and be Hulk and She-Hulk.

Or we could paint ourselves blue
and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.

Is there any scenario
where we're not in full-body paint?

Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.

So, hey, um, are you sure
the guys are okay with me coming?

Yeah, of course. Why?

This is just something
you usually do together,

and if I'm screwing it up,
I don't have to go.

Oh, why, do you... You not wanna go?

Why, do you not want me to go?

No, I want you to go.

Okay, good.

Because that's what I want, too.

Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk!

I don't wanna take my shirt off
at Comic-Con!

If I may speak for Comic-Con,
"We don't want that, either."

ls that nice?

No, but it's honest,

and it sounds like you could use a
little more honesty in your relationship.

Uh, it's more complicated than that.

I'm always honest with Amy.

The other day, she said
she was self-conscious

about the beauty mark on her shoulder.

And I said, "You can call that
a beauty mark all you want.

"When there's hair growing out of it,
that's a mole."

Do you think she's as honest with you?

Well, I should hope so.

When she called me an insensitive jerk,
I'd like to think she meant it.

There's gotta be other ways
you can make a quick buck.

Yeah, you'd think.

Oh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm!

I really should wear a bell around my neck
so you guys can hear me coming.

- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

Oh, double-stuffed Oreos,
I remember when I could afford you.

- Ugh, there she goes.
- Wait, stay, I'll get her.

- I appreciate it.
- That's fine. She and I can cry together.

He's such a sweetie.

I know. I wish there was some way
we could help him.

If he could find a girl with a job,
all his problems would be over.

Yep, that's working out great for me.

Penny says they're ready to go.

(SIGHS) Very well,
prepare for a long night of deceit.

(SIGHS) Sheldon, women can wear makeup,
it's not lying!

I was talking about Leonard.

And if makeup is so truthful,
why is it called "concealer"?

Wait, wait, wait,
what's Leonard lying about?

He doesn't really want Penny
to go to Comic-Con,

he's just doing it to make her happy.

Really?

Because she doesn't actually want to go,
she's just doing it to make him happy.

So, they're both trying to
make each other happy,

and the end result is
they make each other sad?

That's hilarious.

I can't wait to tell them.

No, you're not gonna tell them anything.
You're gonna stay out of it.

- Why?
- Because it's between them.

Well, if you haven't noticed, I've been
between them for the last 10 years.

- Hey.

- Hello.
- Hi.

- Hey babe, you wanna drive?
- Sure. Or you can.

<i>No</i>, it's fine.
I know you don't like the way I drive.

I don't have a problem with your driving.

Are you listening to this?
They deceive each other about everything.

AMY: Shh.

Just so you know,
that guy in the parking lot hit me.

He wasn't in a car, but okay.

PENNY: Just say you wanna drive.

LEONARD: I honestly don't.

Amy, do us a favor, please drive.

Sure, happy to.

If you wanna drive, just drive!

I don't see why this has to be
so complicated.

It's not complicated!
Amy's driving, that's it!

That's not it,
because you're clearly upset.

You're the one who seems upset.

Why would I be upset?

Because you don't want her
to go to Comic-Con!

This is an interesting way
to stay out of it.

Wait, you don't want me to go?

Well, (SIGHS) ljust don't think
you're gonna have a good time.

Yeah, well, get this! Neither does Penny,
that's why she doesn't want to go.

You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.
Good job.

Why would you say you wanted to go
if you didn't?

I just thought it would make you happy.

(STAMMERING) Okay, hold on,
so if you don't want to go,

and I don't need to bring you,

is everything good?

Hold on, I'm trying to decide
if I'm mad at you.

No, I'm happy, I don't have to go!

- Okay, problem solved. Yeah.
- Okay.

Not entirely. The fight over
who's going to drive is still going--

Oh, my God, stop talking!

The place looks great.
Did you guys get a maid?

Kinda.

Dinner's almost ready.

If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like
its cousin, bowl of meat.

If you're still looking to make money,
I will pay you to burn that jacket.

Thank you, but it doesn't look like
I'm going to Comic-Con this year.

Well, with as much debt as you have,
probably not next year, either.

- Howie?
- Sure.

This is for you.

What's this?

It's back pay for all the babysitting
and taking care of Halley you've done.

There's more than enough in there
to cover Comic-Con.

Um, I also take care of Halley.

-(SIGHS)
- And you live here for free.

I do, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

This is so generous of you.
(STAMMERING) I don't know what to say.

Now you can come with us!

Yeah, there's room in the bed
by Sheldon's feet.

As much as I appreciate this,
I can't accept it.

Okay? Halley's my goddaughter,
I don't take care of her for money.

I would.

Keep it, consider it a gift.

(STAMMERING) Hold on!
ls it back pay or is it a gift?

What's the difference?

When the IRS questions us
in separate rooms,

we need to have our stories straight.

It doesn't matter, I'm not keeping this.

I'm trying to pay my own way
and be responsible.

Taking handouts won't help that.

So you're not going to Comic-Con?

(SIGHS) I've been plenty of times.

If I miss one, it's fine. I'm a big boy.

I'm a big boy, and if I missed one,
I'd throw a big boy tantrum.

You know what? I've gone 12 times.

Maybe I'll sit out this year, too.

- Really?
-(MUMBLES) Yeah.

Maybe you and I can do
something fun that weekend.

Ooh! How about whitewater rafting?

(STAMMERING)

How about we compromise and go
on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

You know what? I'm not gonna go, either.

I'm a father now.
I'd rather spend time with my family.

You just don't wanna go alone
with Sheldon.

I'm gonna go check on dinner.

Sounds like everyone's staying home.
What do you say?

Nuts to that! I'm going to Comic-Con!

BY Yourself?

Not necessarily.

I have four months to find
some new friends.

I'll go with you.

That's very kind of you, Stuart.

Check back in with me in July.

There's my pretty girlfriend.

I'm not going with you to Comic-Con.

You... What?

Can't a man just be happy to see his woman

and pat her on her second-most
erogenous ball-and-socket joint?

He can,
but it's still not changing my mind.

Well, maybe what's in my pants
will change your mind.

It's a list of this year's panelists.

It's long, isn't it?

English - SDH

Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?

What? ls it another video of him
and his dog

<i>Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?</i>

No, he can't afford his apartment,

and he's asking if anyone knows
of a cheap place to live.

(CHUCKLES) I wanna say India,
but it seems mean.

(SNICKERING)

What's so funny?

Raj is looking for a cheap place to live,
and I wrote "India."

Don't post that, be supportive.

Maybe you should be supportive
of my hilarious jokes.

(CHUCKLES) Fine, what should we do?

We're smart,
I'm sure we can think of something.

You wanna let him live here?

Oh, we're smarter than that.

I know our apartment's small,
but I think we can make room.

No, Sheldon!

We are not getting a
life-size Spider-Man statue.

We do have Sheldon's old room.

If he really needs a place to stay,
I guess we should offer it to him.

You're a good friend.

Am I still a good friend
if I wait and hope

that Howard offers him
a place to live first?

You're an even better husband.

I know if the roles were reversed,
he would do it for me.

Where would he stay?
We already have Stuart.

Well, we can make some space
in the garage,

maybe put a cot out there,

get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.

That sounds awful.

Let's hope he thinks so too.

For the last time, no Hulk,
no Batman, no life-size statues.

Wow.

I'm starting to think you didn't mean it
when you said you wanted to

-spruce up the place.
-(SIGHS)

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

- Hello?
- Hey.

Uh, so, we've been talking,
and if you need a place to stay,

we'd be happy to fix up the garage
for you.

That would be amazing!

I was literally just looking at
my moving boxes,

trying to pick one to live in.

I know it's not ideal,

but you'd have plenty of space
for your furniture,

and there's this cool button that makes
an entire wall go up and down. (CHUCKLES)

I cannot thank you enough.

<i>- It is our pleasure.
-(CELL PHONE BEEPING)</i>

Hey. Can you hold on one sec? Hello?

Hey, buddy,
you still looking for a place to live?

Uh, yeah, why do you ask?

You know, we have the extra bedroom,
and if you need it, it's yours.

Oh, my God, that's so generous!

It's the least we can do.

Why, I really appreciate it.
Can you hold on one second?

Hey. So, Howard,
what's the bathroom situation gonna be?

Well, there's a sink out there,
that takes care of half your problems.

But I can use
the downstairs bathroom, right?

Yeah, we barely use it,
so, it'll be like it's yours.

Cool, cool.
Yeah, yeah, hold on one second.

Well, I...

Hey. What's it like
sharing a bathroom with Penny?

Is there hair everywhere?
Does she use your loofah?

I don't have a loofah.

Okay, well, if I move in,
you can't use mine. Hold on a second.

Hey. Howard,
how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

I don't know...
Why are you asking all these questions?

Well, to be honest,
Leonard's on the other line,

and he offered me their spare bedroom.

Great, go live there.

But you made the garage sound so fun.

Yeah, I just didn't want you to
feel bad about it.

Unless Leonard's apartment
also has a raccoon

that chews its way in
on cold nights, go there.

One second. (CLEARS THROAT)

Okay, I think we're close.

How do you feel about
a mini-fridge in my room?

Hey. Pal, you wanna live here or not?

Oh. Uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Hi. Penny, this circular
is addressed to "occupant,"

but with our apartment switch,
it's unclear whether it's yours or mine.

PENNY: What's it for?
SHELDON: Uh, roofing.

PENNY: Yeah, it's yours.

SHELDON: Okay, thanks.

"Just throw it out."

Speaking of occupants,

I'm given to understand Raj will be
moving into my old room.

Yeah, for a little while.

What about his dog?

Uh, she'll be in her crate,
it's not a big deal.

I suppose that's acceptable.

AMY: Well, Sheldon's getting
a little better with dogs.

He even took a picture with Pluto
at Disneyland.

SHELDON: If real dogs gave me buttons,
I'd like them too.

Well, I think it's very nice
that you're helping out our friend.

I think it's nice that you're taking

whatever medication
Amy's clearly giving you.

Now, what is that supposed to mean?

Well, it's like that science thing.

For every action,
you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.

Just when I thought
you couldn't get any hotter.

PENNY: Mmm-hmm.

SHELDON: If you're implying

that I'd have some problem with him
moving into my room, you're wrong.

Now, Raj is in
a difficult financial situation,

and I'm glad he's making changes
to improve it.

Do not adjust the dosage, you nailed it.

Don't listen to them.

What's weird is that Penny
almost got a science fact right.

I mean, it's unfair.
People just assume I'm going to be upset

by Raj moving into my old room.

But, you are, aren't you?

Oh, I'm outraged.

Talk to me, tell me what's going on?

Well, that's been my room
since before I met Leonard,

and now, someone else
is going to be living in it.

And that someone else is not me,

and you know how I feel about people
who aren't me.

There are a lot of memories wrapped up
in that room.

For me, too.

First time you told me you loved me
was in that room.

Wrong, we were standing outside my room
in the hallway.

- And there is the love of which I speak.
-(SIGHS)

I realize it's irrational,

but with Raj moving in there,
I'm feeling a bit replaced.

Well, this isn't an easy time for him.

He's losing his apartment, he's in debt,
he's probably humiliated.

Yes, "probably,"

but until we know for sure,
how can I feel better?

Can I get anyone anything at all?

Raj, you don't have to serve us.

It's the least I can do
for helping me carry my stuff up.

Well, it was really no problem.

Not for you, box of towels.

Anyway, thanks again.

Hey. Look at that.
You got a Raj, we got a Stuart,

maybe we should take 'em both to the park,
let 'em run around together. (CHUCKLES)

I don't know,
yours looks like he has worms.

(CHUCKLES)

- You ready to go?
- All set.

- What's that?
- A housewarming gift for Raj.

Well, a bunch of fake snakes
better not spring out of it,

'cause that was a lousy
anniversary present.

It's nothing like that.

I just-- I thought about Raj's situation,
and I had a change of heart.

And regarding your gift, you said,
"Surprise me," and boy, did I. (CHUCKLES)

- Hello.
- Hi.

Perfect timing. Food's ready.

Yeah, wait. Before we eat,

I have a little
welcome-to-the-building gift for Raj.

- Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that?
- No, I already asked.

Thank you, Sheldon.

It's a blank notebook.

I had some of my best ideas in that room,
and I'm sure you will too.

You also never had sex in that room,
that's something else to look forward to.

This means a lot.

Well, I know
this is a difficult time for you.

You're losing your apartment,
you're in debt,

and you just-- You must be humiliated.

- Sheldon.
- Do I--

Good grief, she is such a stickler for
citing sources, those were Amy's words.

- Sheldon--
- I know, I know!

"Good grief" was originally said
by Charlie Brown, geez.

You're right, lam humiliated.

Thanks for pointing it out,
you're such a jerk.

Could you believe this guy?

- Yeah.
- Yes.

I thought that was gonna break
the other way.

Come on, Sheldon,
maybe we should just eat at our place.

Fine.

Wait, you took my room,

you turned my friends against me,
I hope you're happy.

What do I have to be happy about?
My life's a wreck.

How come he can say it and I can't?

Just keep walking.

(LAPTOP DIALING)

<i>Hello, Sheldon, what a pleasant surprise.
How are you?</i>

Honestly, I've been better.

Do you have time?
Leonard says you're very busy these days.

<i>Oh, I just say that because he prattles.</i>

<i>What's going on?</i>

Well, our friend Raj moved
into my old room,

and it's brought up
a lot of negative feelings for me.

<i>Hmm. What do you think
the loss of your room represents?</i>

Beverly, you know
I hold you in high esteem,

can we skip the part where you pretend
not to know the answer,

and get to the part
where you tell me the answer?

<i>Very well, but if you don't mind,
I'd still like to pause for effect.</i>

(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>Now...</i>

<i>You've recently moved in
with Dr. Fowler, yes?</i>

I have.

<i>But clearly, your old room represents
an escape hatch,</i>

<i>and without it, you're forced to confront</i>

<i>the terrifying reality of being trapped
in a relationship with Amy forever.</i>

I hadn't thought about that.

And don't start thinking about it now!

<i>BEVERLY: Hello, Amy.</i>

<i>Your defensiveness may indicate
similar insecurities</i>

<i>about your relationship with Sheldon.</i>

That's not true!

<i>She said defensively.</i>

This isn't about me and Sheldon,

this is about Rajesh moving in
with Leonard and Penny.

<i>Interesting.</i>

<i>They've found a need to take
yet another roommate.</i>

<i>It seems they're avoiding
some harsh realities themselves.</i>

I had no idea all our relationships
were such a disaster.

BOY, You're good.

<i>That is the word on the street, dear.</i>

Maybe moving in was a bad idea.

I haven't been here one day,
I'm already causing problems.

No, you didn't do anything, it's Sheldon.

"You didn't do anything, it's Sheldon,"

that would make a nice needlepoint pillow.

Relax, we're happy to have you.

Thank you, but how do I know
you're not saying that just to be nice?

Do you actually pay for that haircut?

That'll do it.

Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.

(STAMMERS) Could you please
put your dog on a leash?

- Sheldon, she's fine.
-(SHELDON SIGHS)

Well, then at least hold her still,
so I can pretend she's stuffed.

Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me,
and I unfairly took it out on you.

Thank you. I appreciate that.

Oh, I can't take all the credit.

I spoke with Leonard's mother,
and she made me feel better.

I don't know who you talked to,
but that wasn't my mother.

(SIGHS)

Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing
insecurities in my relationship with Amy,

in the same way that Leonard and Penny
are in their relationship.

What are you talking about? We're fine.

Yes, you're fine as long as
you have a buffer living with you

to distract from your marital problems.

It used to be me,
now it's Raj and his attack tribble.

Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.

Oh. And FYI, if you cry
while they're fighting,

they'll take you to McDonald's.

(LAPTOP DIALING)

<i>Hello, Leonard.</i>

Why are you saying
we have marital problems?

We don't have marital problems.

<i>I see, you must be yelling at me
out of wedded bliss.</i>

Look, just because we took our friend in

does not mean that Penny and I
are afraid to be alone.

Yeah, this is a special circumstance.

<i>Sheldon mentioned you tried to
get your brother to live with you as well.</i>

Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen
twice and still be special.

<i>Do you agree with that?</i>

Well, now that you point it out...

Are you kidding me?

We do seem to keep finding roommates.

Now you're taking her side?

<i>Dear, I would never come between
you and Leonard.</i>

<i>That's for your parade of roommates to do.</i>

RAJ: (WHISPERING) Howard.

<i>Howard.</i>

-(SCREAMING)
-(SHRIEKS)

It's me. It's just me.

What are you doing here?

(STAMMERS) Well, I texted you,
but you didn't respond,

and Leonard and Penny were arguing--

Not on my watch!

It's fine, it's just Raj.

You can hit him with the bat,
but it's fine.

And if my heart stops, just let me go.

L'm sorry, guys-

Sheldon was upset,
Leonard and Penny were fighting,

I just wanted to go someplace
where I wasn't causing problems.

(SIGHS) I'll say it again,

India.

Can I just stay in the garage?

(SIGHS) Don't do that,
we'll make up the couch for you,

and figure out something in the morning.

- Thank you.
- Come on,

I'll get you some sheets,
and then we'll see

if I can beat my high score
on the blood pressure machine.

(BOTH PANTING)

Never should've had
all these kids so close together.

(SIGHS)

Are you okay?

I can't sleep.

What's wrong?

Beverly believes I unconsciously
consider my old room an escape hatch.

Is that bothering you?

Yes. I don't care for
unconscious thoughts.

My brain and I are best friends,
it should tell me everything.

I mean,
how it relates to our relationship,

not the bromance between you
and your brain.

Well, what if she's correct?

Doesn't that say
something troubling about us?

I don't know, ljust think
you're the kind of person

who likes a contingency plan.

That is true.

Did you know I figured out

in which order I would eat all my friends
in the event of an apocalypse?

You need to stop hanging out
with your brain so much,

it's not a good influence.

If you're looking for spare change,
I already cleaned it out.

Well... (SIGHS) Didn't think
this is where my life would be.

Me, either.
I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch,

I'm actually winning.

You know, we're both down on our luck,

maybe you and I should try
to get a place together.

(CHUCKLES) Okay, listen to me.

(MOUTHING) Okay.

There is no reason to leave here.

This is great.
Everyone's nice, it's comfortable.

If all goes according to plan,
this is my retirement home.

Wouldn't you feel better about yourself
if you were more independent?

Better than I feel in their steam shower?
I don't think so.

Penny would be the entrÃ©e.

Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.

And then because I love you,
you're dessert.

I wanna say, "Aw,"
but I'm gonna say, "Ew."

Well, you see, I'm doing this
so I can stop being spoiled

and, you know, grow as a person.

Good for you.

This sandwich has
six dollars' worth of ham in it.

Don't you even feel a little bad
sponging off your friends?

Hey, look, I went to art college,

I tried to make it as a graphic artist,

comic book artist,

and you know what I got for my efforts?

A visible rib cage.

I'm not kidding,
you can see my heart beating.

Well, no offense,
but I didn't go to art school.

I have a PhD in astrophysics.

Hmm. Great. Then it'll be easier for you

to look up at the stars
without a roof over your head.

Morning.

Did you know Raj moved out last night?

What? Why?

"Leonard and Penny,
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

"L went to stay at Howard's.

"P.S., Cinnamon's with me,

"but if you feel like
messing with Sheldon,

"tell him she's loose in the building."

I feel terrible.

Should we go bring him back?

Well, you're the one worried

having someone live with us
is a sign of problems.

Well, that was just because
my mother got in my head.

It's like being possessed,

but instead of Satan, it's--
Actually, it's the same thing.

(SIGHS) All right,
so we'll ask him to come back.

Great.

Don't you wanna get dressed first?

Just one second.

Help, Cinnamon's loose in the building!

<i>SHELDON". Amy, quick, lock the door!</i>

We're so sorry
if we made you feel uncomfortable,

we really weren't fighting about you.

I just never want to be a burden
on my friends.

Me, either, don't wanna be a burden.

Is that the baby? I'll go check.

You're not a burden,

and we want you to come back
and stay with us.

But I also upset Sheldon,

and he's not gonna wanna come over
if I'm there.

More reasons for you to stay.

Halley's fine.

You know
she's at my parents' house, right?

And she's having the time of her life.

If you ever wanna change things up,
you're always welcome here.

Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.

I appreciate it,

but I think staying with Leonard and Penny
makes more sense for everyone.

Then it's settled.

And just so you know, it's only temporary,
I'm not gonna get too comfortable.

Good, nobody needs a mooch
living in their house forever.

Hey, that's no way
to talk about your baby.

You know what, I'm proud of us.

You know, with Penny
and Leonard taking in Raj,

and Stuart living with Howard
and Bernadette,

we're the only couple of our social group

who doesn't need to fill the holes
in their relationship with a third party.

Yeah, we're killing it.

English - SDH

You know, downward-facing dog comes from
the Sanskrit phrase <i>adho mukha svanasana.</i>

Oh, that's beautiful. What does it mean?

"Downward-facing dog."

Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit
for "butts up and heads down."

Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra.

If it involves butts,
there's a word for it.

I thought we were getting breakfast
before work.

Oh, right, sorry.

It's my fault,
I asked Penny to do yoga with me.

You know, if you want,
I can get ready in five minutes.

(CHUCKLES) It's Cute that you think that.

Don't worry about it.

Hey, can I ask a favor?
Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?

Sure. You're living here for free,
I guess I owe you.

Bye, Cinnamon, be a good girl.

- Yeah, bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard. (LAUGHS)

Okay, and tree pose.

Well, she's done.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Things have been going really well
with the infinite persistence gyroscope.

That's great, how so?

Oh, the project is classified,
I can't tell you.

Oh, I suppose I could redact
the classified parts.

All right.
Um, I came up with an elegant solution

-to the reduction of scale problem.
-(HORN BLARING)

- I used the nonlinear dynamics...
-(HORN BLARING)

-...and then I generated flow vortices...
-(HORN BLARING)

...using a higher temperature
Bose-Einstein condensate,

and that did it.

(HORNS HONKING)

Wow. Wonder what they're redacting.

Why don't you ask me what I'm working on?

Oh, very well.
What have you been working on?

And feel free to honk
during the boring parts.

I'm doing some experiments
to show that the signal to move a muscle

occurs before you know
you even decided to move it.

What-- So you're attempting to pinpoint
where consciousness resides in the brain?

Yes. I'm trying to figure out,
to the nanometer and the attosecond,

precisely where and when
an event of awareness takes place.

Well, what do you know?

Here I was,
waiting to be bored with biology,

and instead,
you tickle my intellectual fancy.

Which, unlike my body,
is an okay place to tickle.

You know, when I was six,

<i>I wanted</i> to marry <i>the gorilla
from Good Night, Gorilla.</i>

Maybe I was onto something.

Gentlemen, the most interesting thing
just happened with this spoon.

Unless it was singing <i>Be</i> Our <i>Guest,</i>
I doubt it.

No, I picked it up
without thinking about it,

which raises a neuroscientific question.

When did I decide to pick it up?

The bigger question is,
what are you gonna eat with that spoon?

You didn't get any food.

He does raise an interesting point.

Amy is studying the time lag
between intent and awareness,

and I realized that applies to the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

Now, I recognize there will be a time lag

between me saying that and you googling
what it means, so I'll wait.

I understand it, Sheldon.

Yeah, me, too.

I'm sorry, I spaced.
Are we still talking about the spoon?

It's nice to see you taking an interest
in Amy's work.

Well, don't get me wrong,

neurobiology is nothing more than
the science of gray squishy stuff.

But you know, when it connects to physics,

"Gas up the Ford, Martha,
we're going for a drive!"

So, did you confront Jennifer?

No, I was going to,
but she called in sick.

And guess who else called in sick.

- Paul? (SCOFFS)
- Paul.

Who's Paul?

Oh, you met him at the office
Christmas party, he's married to Nancy.

Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?

I bet Jennifer gets a promotion
out of this, which is so unfair,

because I work twice as hard as she does.

Don't worry, Jerry won't be fooled
by that type of behavior.

- Jerry?
- Wait.

It didn't work for Randy,
it didn't work for Tina,

it sure as hell
isn't gonna work for Jennifer.

Well, I hope not. ljust hate
when people play those kinds of games.

Tina?

With your sales record,
you have nothing to worry about.

Hmm.

I went to your office Christmas party?

You know, I like harp lessons,

but I'm thinking of
switching to elevator repair lessons.

What are you working on?

I was thinking about your experiment
on the neuroscience of decision-making,

and I realized, if we connect it to the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics,

we have a chance to disprove
the role of consciousness

in the Copenhagen interpretation.

Wait, are you saying if we combine
my experiment with your calculations,

we can determine
the precise moment in time

when the wave function collapses?

It could be the most inspired combination
since I mixed red lcee into my blue lcee.

It was like drinking
two-sevenths of the rainbow.

Sheldon, this is really interesting.

Yeah, and this one
won't stain my teeth purple.

You know, we've
never collaborated professionally before.

Are you worried
it might affect our relationship?

That is a valid point.

Oh. Perhaps we should establish
some ground rules.

Well, that would make me feel better.

All right, let's start right now.

Uh, rule number one,
no using sexuality to get your way.

That's a ridiculous rule.

Is it?

Okay, how is that?

I can actually feel
the toxins being pulled out of my skin.

Well, this is a moisturizing mask.

Ah, well, then I can actually feel
the moisture going into my skin.

Hey, I hope you don't mind, I used
a little of your eye cream last night.

I thought someone looked
brighter and tighter.

Still like to know who Jerry is.

No, don't worry about it. Hey, after this,

how about we all go out
and do something together?

That would be great, thank you.

You wanna go shopping?

Ooh! Yes, fun!

Or we could do something we'll all enjoy,
like play a board game.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(INAUDIBLE)

Oh, I believe I've made some progress
on our ground rules.

Oh, good. What are they?

Okay. Uh, number one, in matters
of physics, I have the final say.

Now, in matters of neuroscience,
you have the final say.

Unless I disagree.

Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,
my name goes first.

Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards,
I speak first.

I don't want to be talking
when the orchestra plays us off.

- Can I see that?
- Of course.

I'll get that back.

Like all my underwear, that notebook says,
"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

Sheldon, if we're gonna have ground rules,
I'll tell you the first ground rule.

I make the ground rules.

I'd write that down,
but I can't now, can I?

I mean, they didn't say anything,

but I just kinda felt
like I was being a weird third wheel.

Oh. So you can tell
what that feels like. Interesting.

Anyway, I figured I can hang out
with my friends and have fun, too.

Well, if your idea of fun is riding
in a minivan to Target for diapers,

things are about to get nuts.

Oh, it's just nice to be with people
who are happy to have me around.

Isn't that right, Halley?

(HALLEY CRYING)

At least someone had the courage
to say it.

Thank you, you are a good citizen.

Told you!

Go ahead, throw my underwear
out the window, same thing's gonna happen.

Terrific. Do you wanna hear
our new set of ground rules?

Fire away.

Number one, we're on the same team,
we're not in competition.

That's smart,
because Sheldon one, Amy zero.

Number two,
disagreements can happen politely,

there's no need to call an idea stupid.

Oh... Someone drew a penis in it.

- Are you listening?
-l'm sorry, go ahead.

Number three, to avoid getting frustrated,
we take built-in breaks

and reward our successes
with a small treat.

(GASPS) Ooh, that sounds fun.

Now, we're talking
about real treats, right?

Not Bible verses,
like my mother used to give me.

Whatever you want.
So, shall we get to work?

Biology and physics coming together?

It's like
the peanut butter cup of the mind.

Oh, I know what I want my treat to be!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(INAUDIBLE)

Wow. Look at that.

Yes, this is remarkable.

So we're agreed, it's complete garbage.

By the way, your name can go first.

I mean, I'm glad they're getting along,

but it's starting
to make me uncomfortable.

Well, are you worried
he's like another man in her life?

A little, until I saw them
in matching tops, so...

Nice, 174 diapers.
That ought to get us to Wednesday.

Well, have you talked to them about it?

What am I supposed to say?
"Stop having fun without me"?

This one says that every time I go out.
(LAUGHS)

See? I listen to you.

Look, Raj just gets along with women.

Yeah, I know, but he was my friend first.

It's like she's stealing him
and they're just having the best time

doing all their dumb girly stuff together.

You sure you don't fit in?
You sound like a catty bitch to me.

I don't know where we went wrong.

The math is so inelegant,
I'm not even sure it makes sense.

Well, don't give up, maybe we can fix it.

(AMY BREATHING HEAVILY)

Can you stop breathing so loud?
I can hear your nose whistling.

I can hear your face talking,
so we're even.

(CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY)

All right, either blow your nose
or teach it to play <i>Camptown Races.</i>

Fine. Fine, you want me to blow my nose?
Here, I'll blow it.

(BLOWING FORCEFULLY)

Better?

No, I can still hear it.

Oh, wait, that's me.
Never mind, it's fine.

You know, you're exhausting!
I knew working together was a bad idea.

Hold on. I see what's wrong here.

We did the propagation
only to the occipital lobe,

not to the prefrontal cortex.

That would mean that this delay parameter
should be increased 250 milliseconds.

Oh. That is much better.

Boy, if good ideas came out of your brain
the way mucus comes out of your nose,

we'd be in good shape.

Now, take a sip,
swirl it around your mouth,

and try to notice the flavors,
the tannins, the textures.

Well?

I probably should've
spit out my gum first.

(BOTH LAUGH)

Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks
have been pretty rough,

but staying here with you guys
has really helped take my mind off of it.

Well, we've loved having you around.
Right, sweetie?

- Leonard?
- Yeah, when did he leave?

Yeah, that's rude.

You know,
it's nice to spend time with people

who don't talk about work
like it's some kind of soap opera.

Jennifer still trying
to sleep her way to the top?

Yeah. (SIGHS)

You should be happy someone wants to
do the stuff with Penny you don't want to.

Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.

What? What do I make you do?

Let's see, the magic store,
the Doctor Who convention,

the National Belt Buckle Collectors
meet-and-greet.

It said right there on the invitation,
"Buckle up for fun!"

It's not my fault you didn't listen.

I'm sure I'm overreacting.

You're entitled to feel how you feel.

If you don't like it,
you should just talk to her.

I don't want to sound like a jealous baby.

Oh. Then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.

You know, I had a feeling you were using
the wrong computational model,

but I didn't say anything
'cause you're so sensitive!

Just because I'm easily bothered
by light, heat, sound, smell

and the way birds look at me
does not mean I'm sensitive!

Hey.

I wonder what kind of success we'd have

if we defined "measurement"
as the first moment

that an action potential
is seen by the visual cortex.

That is a daring and insightful solution.

We're finally making progress.
I wish we could do it without fighting.

What if the fighting is the reason
we're making progress?

I suppose it's conceivable

that the hormones associated
with our fight-or-flight response

could be sharpening
our cognitive processes.

Well, if that's the case,

then your grandparents mumble
and have bad posture.

How dare you speak that way
about my grammy and--

Hey, wait a second, wait.

Delta T could equal alpha subzero.

It seems we have a choice to make.

Abandon all ground rules
in the name of science,

or give up collaborating
for the sake of our relationship.

There's only one clear choice.

- Science it is.
- No, you bonehead!

Name-calling, that is perfect!

Now, when I get to this equation here,
really let me have it.

Now, it... If it helps,
I'm not the sharpest dresser.

Anyway, I know it's silly,

but since Raj moved in,
I've been feeling a little left out.

Well, sweetie, that's crazy.

No, no, Penny, don't dismiss his feelings.

- Thank you. ljust feel like--
- Hang on.

I'm not saying
that his feelings aren't crazy,

ljust don't want him to think
that this isn't a safe place.

Well, to be truthful, lately--

PENNY: <i>Well,
why wouldn't this be</i> a <i>safe place?</i>

I mean, he's surrounded by his wife
and one of his best friends.

- I don't wanna speak for Leonard.
- Thank you. I--

But when you're insecure,

no amount of external validation
can ever make you feel safe.

Yeah, you're right. You know,

you're really sensitive
about this kind of stuff.

- L'm a good listener. (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

Hey, Olsen twins.

- What?
-(STAMMERING) Well,

I'm sitting right here!
You're talking about my feelings

and somehow leaving me
out of the conversation!

I'm sorry, what did you want to say?

I don't know, you pretty much covered it.

Can you read them back?

Revised ground rule number one,

we are on the same team,
but it is a competition.

Excellent. Excellent.

Now, on a related point,
you're going down, punk.

Revised ground rule number two,

there are definitely stupid questions

and those who ask them can be told so
right to their stupid face.

I love that one.

Thanks,babe.

Number three,
fair topics for insult include

educational pedigree, scientific field,
intellectual prowess and mamas.

That list is strong.

Like your mother's urge
to be promiscuous with sailors.

English - SDH

Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow,

I have to do a little reception
after work.

Oh! I would, but we need to make a push
on the Air Force project.

Are you sure?
We're celebrating our new ADD drug.

I mean, it'll probably be over in,
like, six minutes.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Did you say you guys are working on
the guidance system tomorrow?

Yeah, why?

Well, Sheldon said that
he was gonna work with me

on our quantum perception project.

We've had this planned for a week.

Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.

Guys, before this gets ugly,
remember, the winner gets Sheldon.

Hey, Raj,
do you wanna go with me tomorrow?

Are you asking because
you want me there or out of pity?

Actually, never mind, don't answer.

I'd love to.

- Hello.
- Why did you tell Leonard

you're working on the gyroscope tomorrow?

Because I am.

But you said you were working with me.

Uh-oh. Someone's got two dates
to the nerd prom.

I have a plan to work on
both projects simultaneously.

And for your information,

the summer conference on
algebraic topology at Caltech

is nerd prom.

I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?

Hmm. I'm not needed at both places
at the same time.

And I can also free up extra hours
with simple tricks,

such as using a minimal amount of words
to convey my point.

When does that start?

Soon.

See, I could've said "in the near future,"

but I didn't say "in the near future"

because "in the near future"
is three more words than "soon."

"In" one, "the" two,
"near" three, "future" four.

See, "in the near future" is four,
"soon" is just one,

four is more than one.
Saving time already.

Genius.

I was going to say, "Why does anyone think
Sheldon's a genius?"

But I didn't.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running.
Shall we get to work?

Uh, before we do,

what are you wearing,
O Friend Who We Pretend ls Normal?

These are hydration backpacks.
They're for efficiency.

Whenever I'm thirsty,
I have access to water.

And when I'm hungry, uh, lentil soup.

It's getting harder to pretend.

Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point
to run the xenon stream

through the cryocooler
or through the vacuum filter.

Well, run down the pros and cons
of each for me.

Well, if we run the xenon stream
through the cryocooler,

it'll be cooled immediately
before it reacts with the conduction--

(SLURPING NOISILY)

Oh, sorry... Carrot chunk.

You can just feel the time being saved.

Ah, I'm back.
You've got me for eight minutes.

Sheldon, this is silly.

You can't expect us to do quality work
with you popping in and out like this.

The coefficient isn't lambda.
It's lambda sub one.

And, over here,
you should consider the possibility

that the brain itself
is in two different quantum states,

and then, lastly,
do you have any little soup crackers?

The rate of spinning
for the central axis centrifuge

has to be four revolutions per second.

It can't be four revolutions.
It's gotta be seven.

Seven? Look at the board. It's four.

- Oh, my God, It's seven. Seven.
- Four.

It's five and a half.

Son of a bitch, it's five and a half.

BRB. You know, that's short for
"Be right back."

I'm saving so much time.

Two signals meet up
in the corpus callosum, and T equals zero.

And I know a boy
who just earned a slurp of soup.

Incredible. Sheldon, I didn't expect
that you could work on both projects,

but I was wrong.

You know, I felt the same way
about the spork.

Solids and liquids handled by one utensil?
That'll never work.

Spoiler, works.

I gotta admit,

we didn't think you'd be able to do
two things at once.

I felt the same way about the platypus.

You know, bird and mammal
in the same creature? No way.

Spoiler, way.

- Hey.
- Hey,

Oh, thanks again for
letting me use your laptop last night.

No problem.

Just doing my taxes.

Okay.

Actually, if I can...
I could just check one more thing--

- I already cleared the browser history.
- You're a good woman.

Whatcha working on?

Trying to catch up on office emails
before I go back.

Oh, that's right.
Maternity leave's almost over.

Oh, you excited?

Yeah, I mean,

I'll miss Halley,
but it'll be nice to get out of the house.

Be intellectually stimulated.

Go out to lunch instead of,
you know, be lunch.

That's great. Good for you.

Yeah, I mean, there's you and my parents.

- She's gonna be fine.
- Well, of course she is.

And that day care is great.

It is. I went to check it out,
and they are very cautious about

letting strange men with no kids
peek in the windows.

Plus, I think I'm setting
a good example for Halley,

to show her that women can be mothers
and still have satisfying careers.

Sure, she won't know where I went
or if I'm ever coming back.

That'll just make the 10 minutes between

when I get home and her bedtime
even more special. (SOBBING)

Uh...

Other than burp you or give you a bottle,
I don't know what to do right now.

It's okay,
I'm just being emotional about this.

Can you not tell Howard?

Oh. Don't you think it'd be healthier
if you told him what's going on with you?

Don't you think it'd be healthier
if you had your own apartment, grown man?

Your secret is safe with me.

Hey, since when do you do laundry
on a Thursday?

Oh, I had an accident at work.

I slipped and fell on my soup sack.

You know, there was a time I would say,
"What's a soup sack?"

But I'm glad we're past that.

(SNEEZES)

You know, there was a time
I would say, "God bless you,"

and then you would say,
"If you must invoke an imaginary deity,

"how about Thor?"

And I would say,

"How do you know I didn't mean Thor?"

And then you would say, "TouchÃ©,"

and that there ends the tale of
why I no longer say, "God bless you."

- Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?
- Oh, yeah.

So, Leonard tells me
you've had a busy day.

Hmm? I did. It hasn't stopped.

I figured out a solution
for our navigation system

while I was pre-soaking lentils
out of my pants.

(SNEEZES)

You getting sick?

Of course not. I'm too busy to be sick.

Well, you're pretty delicate.

Maybe you shouldn't be
pushing yourself so hard.

I'm fine.

All right, well, we'll just pretend that
you didn't catch a cold watching Frozen.

That didn't happen.

You also got a nosebleed watching <i>Up.</i>

Just do your laundry!

Stuart. You didn't have to make dinner.

Well, I felt bad about
upsetting you this morning.

And to be honest,
I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.

- Hey, what's for dinner?
- Meatloaf.

- Oh. Cool.
- Stuart made it.

Oh, cool. (CHUCKLES)

Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley
to the zoo this weekend.

Get in a little family time
before you go back to work.

Sounds great.

Speaking of which, for day care,
it'll be easy for me to drop her off

unless you wanna do it.

Hmm. Guess it should be me.

I can't do it.
They have a picture of me on file now.

You Okay?

Of course, why?

Well, I don't know.
You seem a little upset.

- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

Why don't you think she's fine?
She sounds fine. She looks fine.

If I saw her on the street,
I'd say, "Damn, that girl's fine."

Sheldon, you're sick. Go back to bed.

(IN NASAL VOICE) I am fine.

Here, eat your toast. (SNEEZES)

Sorry.

It's okay. Now, I don't need butter.

Oh, perhaps I am a little
under the weather.

It's nothing a little cold medicine
and tea can't fix.

You need sleep.

What I need, is to get to work.

Well, I don't want your germs around me.

You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth,
but you draw the line at 102 fever?

What happened to our love?

Sheldon, are you okay?

What's going on?

How'd I get here?

I don't know.
We came home from work and we found you.

Home from work?

- What time is it?
- It's 9:00.

9:00?

Wait, what happened to 8:00, and 7:00,
and all the other o'clocks?

Uh, you don't remember?

Well, I remember waking up in the morning.

Amy rubbing Vick's on my chest.

And her hands were like
two frozen chunks of tundra.

I took some cold medicine to-- (GASPS)

I took cold medicine.

You did seem a little loopy
when you showed up at the lab.

At the lab.

Why am I naked from the waist down?

I don't know where your pants are,

but we did find your underwear
in a pot on the stove.

My pants are missing,
I don't remember anything.

Penny, this is your youth, what do I do?

I don't know. Check your body for tattoos?

- Leonard, would you be a lamb--
- She's kidding.

Wait, wait. Where's my bag?
My phone and my wallet are in my bag.

It's right here.

(SIGHS)

Where's my notebook?
My notebook's gone. Oh, no.

Okay, it's just a notebook.
What's the big deal?

"What's the big deal?"

It's full of classified information
about the Air Force project.

How could you lose that?

It's okay. I'm sure we'll find it.

Look, it's gotta be around here somewhere.

Maybe it's wherever your pants are.

Nope. Pants in the microwave. No notebook.

Hey.

Hello.

(SIGHS) Something's going on
with Bernadette.

She say anything to you?

Nope, not a word.

Come on, be honest.

Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?

No, but I did mention it to my therapist.

I know she's mad at me about something.

Well, what have you done
that would upset her?

Oh. Gosh, how much time do you have?
(CHUCKLES)

Why don't you just
start with the worst thing?

Hmm. Let's see.

Okay, here we go. Six years ago,

I got a call that
Bernie's Great-Aunt Trixie died.

And?

(WHISPERS)
I forgot to give her the message.

That's terrible.

The terrible part is ever since then

I've been sending Bernie
Christmas cards from Trixie.

Oh...

Howard.

Let me finish,
and one card had $5 in it

I took from Bernie's purse.

The notebook isn't in the bathroom.

I can't find it either.
How can he not remember a day?

Well, people who are
abducted by aliens lose time.

I mean, maybe it happens
to the aliens, too.

- Well, it's not across the hall.
- That's it.

I'm in breach of my security clearance.
I'm going to prison.

You know what happens to
people like me in prison.

I'll be forced to be
some large man's tutor.

You're not going to prison.

But, boy, it is funny to think about.
(LAUGHS)

- You really can't remember anything?
-l'm trying.

Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.

<i>Why'?</i>

It's possible
it was tracking everywhere you went.

- Phones can do that?
- Yeah. Depends on the privacy settings.

Wow. That's so cool.

How do you, uh...
How do you turn that thing off?

Relax. I know when you go for a run,
you stop for a donut.

I don't even run there. I drive.

Hang on. I can see every place you went.

What does it say?

Uh, you were in the building,
you were at the university,

then you were somewhere on
Colorado Boulevard.

- Where?
- Wait, hang on.

- Did you go to a cowboy bar?
<i>- I __</i>

No! That is preposterous.

(SHELDON EXCLAIMS)

Maybe.

Hey, how's it going?

- Fine.
-(CHUCKLES) Good.

- Love you.
- Love you, too.

Love you more. (CHUCKLES)

Okay, you won.
Can I finish what I'm doing?

Sure, sorry.

(HOWARD HUMMING)

Something on your mind?

No, nothing.

Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like
something's bothering you.

Nope,all good.

Prove it. Make love to me
right now on the kitchen floor.

No. What is wrong with you?

A-ha! You are upset.

I don't know a lot about women,
but I know I upset them.

Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird,
but it has nothing to do with you.

- It doesn't?
- No.

I didn't want to tell you,

but I'm having a really tough time
about going back to work.

Oh.

Okay. Well, I get that.
It was hard for me when I went back.

It was?

Of course. I missed you, and the baby,

and being able to watch <i>Ellen</i> every day.

I just don't know
what the right thing to do is.

If I go back to work,
I'm abandoning Halley.

If I don't go,
I'm giving up everything I've worked for.

It's like there's no right choice.

Look, I don't know
what the best decision is either,

but whatever we choose,
if we're not happy,

we can undo it.

I guess.

And the best part is
Halley won't remember a thing.

(CHUCKLES) Babies are cute,
but they're dumb.

I go like this, she thinks I'm gone.
Then magically I'm back.

Honestly, why are we saving for college?

I'm not crazy about you
calling our baby dumb.

Well, she gets it from me. (CHUCKLES)

Speaking of which,
I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

Does this place look familiar?

It's hard to say.

Hey! Sheldon's back!

ALL: Sheldon!

It's getting clearer.

You gonna buy another round for the house?

No, thank you.

We now know
why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.

Ask him.

Um. Yes, howdy, partner.

Do you happen to recollect
if I left a notebook

in these here parts?

"These here parts?"

It's called fitting in.
By the way, good luck.

- Here you go.
- Oh! Thank goodness.

One top secret quantum guidance system.

You understood the math?

No, Sheldon told me all about it.
He told everybody.

That's just great.

Oh, don't worry. He made us pinky swear
we'd keep it a secret.

- I swear...
- ALL: I swear...

- Not to tell anyone...
- Not to tell anyone...

(WHISPERS) The top secret military
information I'm about to tell you.

ALL: (WHISPERING) The top secret military
information I'm about to tell you.

We really need to skedaddle.

- Thank you.
- Bye. See you.

I should probably erase this.

Thank you for making me tea.

You're welcome. How is it?

Yummy.

And warm on my back.

Do you need anything else?

You know exactly what I need.

Fine.

<i>(SINGING) Soft kitty, warm kitty
Little ball of fur</i>

<i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty
Purr, purr, purr</i>

That's nice.

Now, in German.

(SINGING IN GERMAN)

Great.

Now Mandarin.

(SINGING IN MANDARIN)

Now Navajo.

English - SDH

All right, we're about to go live,
everyone on their A-game, good energy.

Hello.

I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

And welcome to a special retrospective,

where we will take a look back
at the history of Fun <i>with Flags</i>

on an episode we're calling...

<i>"Fun with Flags, Behind the Flags,
A Retrospective."</i>

<i>Wondering how it all began?</i>

<i>You'll need a good attention span</i>

<i>For information and entertainment</i>

<i>That's equally effective</i>

<i>It's fun with flags, behind the flags
A retrospective</i>

<i>Flags</i>

And mind you, when we say,
"Behind the flags,"

we don't literally mean these flags,
that's just where we have dinner.

Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering
how Fun <i>with Flags</i> began.

So let's hear from some people
who were there at the very start.

Howard, flashback sounds.

(PLAYING FLASHBACK MUSIC)

- I could've played that on my harp.
- Just roll the clip.

<i>SHELDON: So tell us in your own words
about that magical moment</i>

<i>when Fun with</i> Flags <i>was born.</i>

I honestly don't remember.

<i>SHELDON". Well, sure you do.</i>

<i>I was telling you both the story</i>

<i>about how Haiti and Liechtenstein
discovered they had the same flag.</i>

<i>It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936,</i>

<i>and two plucky nations--</i>

Wait, I remember.

<i>SHELDON:
Yeah, and do you remember what you said?</i>

Yes. "Please find someone who cares."

And that's exactly what I did.

I found a lot of someones.

Almost 200.

Many of them on purpose.

And now we're going to
turn it over to you, the viewers,

to call in and share your favorite
Fun <i>with Flags</i> moments.

And don't get discouraged if the
phone lines are jammed, just keep trying.

<i>Oh,</i> thank <i>God! Welcome</i> to <i>Fun with Flags.</i>

Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

What-- Hello, Bert, and what is your
flag-related comment or query?

I have a girlfriend.

And what does that have to do with flags?

Nothing, ljust wanted everyone to know
I have a girlfriend.

All right, Bert, you're tying up the line.

My apologies to all of you trying to
call in with legitimate flag comments.

All right, we have our next caller.

<i>BERT". Her name's Rebecca.</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Should we get lunch
or you wanna eat at the zoo?

"Oh, Howie, I don't need food
as long as I can look at my phone."

I don't like when you imitate me.

You wanna hear my Stuart?

"It's been a while
since I've gone on a date.

"You mind if we
watch the monkeys doing it?"

I said that to you in confidence.

If this is supposed to be
our family fun day,

what's so important on your phone?

I'm on the day care's website.

What-- Stop looking at that.

The day care's great. It's on campus.

My office is two minutes away,
there's nothing to worry about.

What if she likes the people
who work there more than us?

She already likes soap bubbles
more than us.

When I go back to work we're gonna
leave her with these people.

We don't know anything about them.

I mean, they're highly-trained educators
with background checks.

They're even required to be current
on all vaccinations.

You leave her with me,
and I'm not any of those things.

Where's Howard?

He took the day off.

Oh, let's take advantage of his absence

and tell the kinds of jokes
only physicists get.

I'll go first.

Oh, hey, here. Heisenberg is pulled over
by a police officer.

And the policeman says, "Did you know
you were going 85 miles per hour?"

And Heisenberg says,
"Darn it, now I don't know where I am."

So Howard back Monday?

Yeah.

- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hello.

- Hey.
- You wanna join us?

(BLABBERS) But he's a geologist,
and I have more physics jokes.

Quick, sit.

So Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.

Yeah, which he rudely announced
on my flag show.

People were so upset about it,

no one else called in
the rest of the night.

Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

I guess ljust love love.

Well, I'm very happy for you.

We're all having dinner tonight,
why don't the two of you join us?

Yeah, hold on,
we don't know anything about this woman.

What do you wanna know?

Well, is she a geologist?

- No.
- Oh, great, see you at 7:00.

How about after this
we go see the exotic bird show?

Not a good idea,
my hair is a coveted nesting material.

Learning anything?

Well, sloth babies cling to their
mothers' bodies for almost a year.

I'm going back to work
after only four months.

So I've learned I hate myself,
I hate sloths,

and I hate you for bringing me here.

Me, I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.

It's not just the sloth.

Polar bears nurse their cubs
for almost eight months.

The orangutan mother builds her baby
a new home every night,

and what do I do?
I choose my career over my child!

Told you we should've gone to LEGOLANDÂ®.

Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend
and I don't.

I thought you were taking a break
from women to focus on your career.

Oh, grow up!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Don't you have any friends he can date?

I already set up Howard and Bernadette.

It's your turn to
ruin some poor girl's life.

- Hey, guys, come in.
- Thanks.

Everyone, this is Rebecca.

- Hi.
- ALL: Hi. Hello.

She's younger
and far more attractive than he is.

(LAUGHS) They're copying you two.

What are you making?

Chicken. Birds mess with my hair,
I come back hard.

Finally get Halley down?

Yeah, eventually.

She's still not happy about
taking a bottle though.

Look, if you're not ready
to go back to work,

we'll figure something out.

No, I'll be fine.

It might be good for her.

Howard's mother
was around him all the time,

and he's a world-class mama's boy.

I mean, why would you say that?

Go ahead, have a tantrum,
that'll prove me wrong.

It would be nice to raise Halley to be
a little more independent than you were.

I guess.

It wasn't until college that I learned
you can put a thermometer in your mouth.

On that charming note, dinner is served.

So, is this your first time
dating a scientist?

'Cause I'm thinking of
starting a support group.

Actually, I'm not new to this.
I was engaged to a Scientologist.

Bert, Rebecca, I'd like to apologize
for my insensitive comment earlier.

Don't worry about it, it's fine.

See, it was fine, I didn't need a timeout.

(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
It wasn't a timeout. Let's get some food.

But you made me sit on the stairs
and think about what I did--

Get your food.

- So how did you two meet?
- Yeah.

Oh, it's such a cute story.

We met on a dating website.

Is that it?

Oh, sorry. "The end."

That's nice. I haven't had much success
meeting people online.

I didn't either,
until I revamped my profile.

What did you do, delete your photo?

- Go.
- Fine.

And don't you slam that door.

Oh, man.

Did I say something wrong?

No, it's always him.

So, Bert, you were telling us
how you updated your profile.

Right, I wasn't getting any responses.

And then I added,
"Recent $625,000 MacArthur Grant winner,"

and five minutes later,

- I met my soulmate.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I was wrong, you can come back in.

So, Rebecca,
how did you become a personal trainer?

I came to Los Angeles to be an actress
and things didn't really work out.

I'd say she's copying you again, but...

I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.

I'd love a personal trainer.

I haven't seen my abs since they opened
a Shake Shack on my drive home.

I could give you some free sessions.

Oh, is that offer for everybody?

(CHUCKLES) Nice try, I'm not going.

- Where's your bathroom?
- Just down there.

She's so perfect,
sometimes I think she isn't real.

And then she goes to the bathroom
and I know she is.

Aw. That's so weird.

I'm sorry, Bert, but aren't you worried
she's only with you for your money?

She better be.

On our first date,
I bought her an 80-inch flat screen.

Your first date? What...
Did you even measure her walls?

Yeah, on our first date,
Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.

And we lived happily ever after.

The end.

- Well, I guess I'm ready to go.
- Have a great first day back.

You have everything she needs
for day care?

Yep, all in the bag.

Okay.

Okay, sweetie, Mommy's going to go
to work now, so you have fun today.

I told her if day care's
anything like prison,

find the biggest baby and knock 'em out.

Bye, cutie. I'm gonna miss you.

(VOICE BREAKING) But I'll be waiting
right here tonight when you get home.

Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

Great, now everybody's crying.

At least Halley's not.

That's good.

She's not gonna see us all day
and she doesn't even care!

- Who's ready to laugh?
-(WHINES)

Okay. So,

Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger
walk into a bar.

Feynman says,
"It appears we're inside a joke."

Einstein replies, "But only to an observer
who saw us walk in simultaneously."

To which Schrodinger says, "If someone
is looking in the window, I'm leaving."

(CHUCKLES) That's actually funny.

(LAUGHS)
You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.

- Hey.
- Hello.

- Hey, Bert. Yeah.
- Join us.

Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.

Actually, it got me thinking that
I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love.

I might break up with Rebecca.

Wow, that's a big step.

I think it shows a lot of character.

I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find a
hot young blonde who likes me for me.

(LAUGHS) Good one.

Okay now, Leonard, you tell a joke.

- BERNADETTE: <i>How's</i> she <i>doing?</i>
- She's great. Here, look.

<i>I see a wall, the floor,</i>

<i>some Asian baby.</i>

<i>There she is.</i>

See? Nothing to worry about.

<i>Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna try
and get some work done.</i>

Yeah, me too. I love you.

<i>Love you too, bye.</i>

(PHONE BEEPS)

- STUART: How <i>is</i> she?
-(YELLS)

What are you doing here?

Can't a guy hang out at a college
he doesn't go to

and stare at a baby that isn't his?

I get it,
I haven't even made it to my office yet.

(CHUCKLING)

ls it weird if we just stand here
and watch her all day?

Probably.

We should go.

Yeah.

(EXHALES)

Or we could take her to the aquarium.

I'll get her, you grab her bag.

Hang on, Halley,
we're busting you out of there!

What are you looking at?

<i>Comments from our
Behind the Flags Retrospective.</i>

Get this, people are calling it,
"The longest one yet."

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- BERT: <i>Hello?</i> Anybody home?

Is that Bert?

<i>It's Bert.</i>

I think it's Bert.

Hey, what's up?

I broke up with Rebecca.

- Oh.
- Oh... Well, good for you.

No. I miss her.

I don't know why I listened to you.

He's not wrong.

It was your crackpot idea
that he deserves love.

You know, you need to start
raising your hand before you speak.

Yes, starting now.

Bert, you're a good guy,
you deserve a woman

who's interested in
more than just your money.

She was also interested in walking
around my house in her underwear.

Now the only one doing that is me.

If you're that upset, go get her back.

I tried, she's not answering my calls.

Which really hurts
because I bought her that phone.

I made a huge mistake.

No, you didn't, okay?

Look, Bert, when I had money,

I dated lots of girls
who weren't right for me.

And then I gave up my money,
and now I'm alone

and living with my friends and somebody
else should probably talk now.

Look, sweetie,
relationships aren't about money, okay?

It's about respect
and having things in common and--

Yes, Sheldon?

You and Leonard don't have anything
in common, maybe you should break up.

You called on him.

Guess who's home from day care?

It's Halley! Unless somebody else put
an "X" on the bottom of their kid's foot.

You realize they called when you took her.

Guess who's home from the aquarium?

Sorry again for barging in.

You don't have to go,
you're welcome to hang with us.

But, actually, our friendship group
is at capacity.

But if anybody drops out,
you are at the top of the list.

Well, unless it's Raj, in which case
we'll probably get a person of color.

You guys are nice,
but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a jet ski

and see if that gets her back.

-(DOOR SHUTS)
- I feel bad for Bert.

Well, so he's using his money
to attract a mate.

Is that any different than me using
my intelligence to attract Amy?

Or Leonard using his power of groveling
to get Penny?

It's totally different.

Bert's money might run out,
but I can beg until the end of time.

All that and he's shorter than me.

Sheldon, what did Amy have
that attracted you?

So many things.

Her mind, her kindness,
and especially her body.

Really?

Relax, we're the same blood type.
He knew he could harvest an organ.

She does look happy.

See, this is the right thing for her.
Let's all just go to work.

Any time.

Let me just say goodbye.

Halley, look at Mommy.

Over here, honey.

Say goodbye to Mommy.

Look at me. Look at your mother!

(BABIES START CRYING)

Right, we can go.

Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

Based <i>on the glowing reception of our
recent Behind the Flags Retrospective,</i>

we thought you might like to see
how it all came together.

So welcome to tonight's episode...

<i>"Fun with Flags,
Behind the Behind the Flags.</i>

<i>"A Retrospective Retrospective."</i>

- Oh, we already have our first call.
- Oh!

<i>Hello, you're on Fun with Flags.</i>

<i>BERT". The jet ski worked, I got her back.</i>

English - SDH

- We're pinned down!
- We can't get through!

Sheldon, get over here and help!

Okay, one second.

Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?

I'm trying to shoot!

Then use the shoot button,

not "The wonderful thing
about Tiggers" button!

Oh.

That's it. We're dead.

Challenge them again.

Doing it right now.

They can't, there's an important
Little League game tomorrow.

No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.

What happened to me?
I used to excel at these things.

Kids are always better at video games.

Well, I don't like it.

If it makes you feel better,
you still dress like a child.

I mean, it's not just video games.

I've downloaded the new OS for my phone,

took me a week to stop accidentally
texting kissy faces to everyone.

Oh. So our love is not real?

Well, I know how you feel.

I tried one of those
electronic Japanese toilets.

Practically shot myself across the room.

I guess ljust need to face it,
I'm no longer a wunderkind.

And now, I just wonder what's for lunch.

- Hot dogs.
- Yay.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

I didn't know you could drink
while you're breastfeeding.

Yeah, they say the yeast in beer
helps with milk production.

I'm pretty sure that's a myth,
let me check.

Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass
over your head!

- To denial!
- PENNY: Whoo!

I'm gonna get another. You want food?

Yeah, breastfeeding burns
like 5,000 calories a day.

Do not touch that phone.

Penny?

Oh, Zack, hey!

What are the odds of
running into you here?

Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.

Uh, what's new?

Oh, tons of stuff.

Put artificial grass in my backyard,

got engaged, had a scary mole
that turned out to be sharpie.

Well, congratulations!

That's what my dermatologist said.

No, on getting engaged. Good for you!

Oh, thanks. How about you?

How's Leonard? ls he still smart?

Yes. Yes, he's working for the government
on an infinite persistence gyroscope.

Of course, the first time I say it right,
he's not even here. (CHUCKLES)

God, I love that little guy.

Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.

Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.

Cool. I'll check with Sara.

Sara, pull up my calendar.

It never works for me.

I've been thinking about
our recent humiliation.

You're gonna have to be more specific.

At the hands of those teenagers.

More.

Boy teenagers.

Oh, the video game! Yeah, that was bad.

I started doing some reading
on cognitive vitality,

and I came across an area of research
called "super-aging."

You know who's a super-ager?
Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?

Well, this is rare, I don't know which
one of you I want to stop talking first.

The theory is that
if you really tax your brain,

the neurofibers will become thicker
and the glial cells more lustrous.

- Like J-Io's hair.
- Yeah--

It is neck-and-neck right now.

How is super-aging any different than
like, doing crossword puzzles?

Well, it's not just doing
simple cognitive tasks.

You need to push your brain out of its
comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.

I drive you to work every day,
my brain must look like the Hulk.

You really want to challenge yourself,
you could learn to speak Hindi.

Could you say that in English?
I actually... I never learned Hindi.

<i>Hey, you ready to go'?</i>

Yeah, I guess.

What's the matter?

Honestly? It's a little strange
having dinner with your ex-boyfriend,

and it's not like
we have a lot to talk about.

What... He loves you, okay?

And he's interested in your work.

You could talk about the infinite
perspective... I swear I know it.

It'll be fine, let's just go.

Well, and his fiancÃ©e will be there.

So, you know, if the conversation lags,
we can talk about their wedding.

Oh!

Come on,
I spent an entire plane ride with you

talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.

Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

Hey, where's your fiancÃ©e?

She couldn't make it.
She had an emergency.

Oh, no, what happened?

Didn't ask.

- Hey.
- Hey,

Hey!

What smells so good?

Raj is teaching me to make croissants.

Is this part of your super-aging?

<i>SHELDON: Yes.
Yeah, it seemed daunting at first,</i>

but then I realized, it's like the
chemistry set I had as a kid.

Yeah, only when your brother eats this,
no one has to call Poison Control.

- Okay, shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

Oh, my God. It's light,

it's flaky, it's buttery.

You don't need to have sex with him,
just eat one of these.

Yes, it is delicious.

But, physicist, baker, lover,
what can't I do?

Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough.

Maybe you need to challenge
your motor skills.

For the last time,
I am not having a tickle fight with you.

You want a real challenge,
try keeping me from eating more of these.

You're just using food to mask the fear

that you're fundamentally unlovable
and therefore going to be alone forever.

Damn it, he's good at that too.

Thanks.

Wow, working on a top-secret
government project,

-that is so cool.
- LEONARD: Oh.

Do you have a bodyguard
to keep spies away?

I have Sheldon,
that keeps most people away.

I miss that guy.

He's like the Swedish Chef Muppet.

I don't know what he's saying,
but he's funny.

Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not.
He's not funny.

So, Penny,
what's going on with you, how's the job?

It's okay,
I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.

Doing amazing.

She can actually make a side effect like

"10% chance of liver failure" sound like
a 90% chance of liver success.

Yeah, lying isn't my
favorite part of the job.

Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.

If you're not happy there,

I've been looking for a new
head of sales at my company.

And we don't sell drugs, just menus.

So the only lie you'll be telling
is we print on recycled paper.

We don't.

Well, that's a nice offer.

You know, we'd make a great team.

Or as we say in the menu business,
I can't do this without "me 'n' you."

Right, 'cause it spells "menu."

Yeah, right? It's funny.

I got a lot of menu jokes,
but that's my favorite.

All right, this is everything.

What do you want to learn?

It really doesn't matter
as long as it's challenging.

Okay, well, how about...

I teach you some close-up magic.

Howard, I'm trying to make
myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.

So you wanted to learn something physical
and you came to Howard Wolowitz?

Hey, the circus arts are very
physically and mentally demanding.

Have you ever tried to juggle?

Yes, I'm juggling my love for you
and my embarrassment of you right now.

And it's hard, isn't it?

So, the key is

the moment one ball is at the
top of its arc, you toss the next one.

- Hm?
- Okay, I think I got that.

<i>No</i>, now, hold on. (CHUCKLES)

There's an old saying in juggling--

ls it, "I'm going to die alone?"

No, it's, "If you want to have fun,
start with one."

Yours we think, but we do not say.

All right, just toss it up and catch it
a few times, get comfortable with it.

Okay.

Just to be on the safe side, am I
in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) <i>No</i>.

Are you sure, 'cause I'm feeling a twinge.

See, that wasn't so bad.
He even picked up the check.

Yeah. Although when he was
trying to figure out the tip,

I'm pretty sure I saw
smoke coming out of his ears.

You're not really considering
working for him, are you?

Well, maybe, I mean,
it seems kind of perfect.

I have sales experience,
and I've been a waitress,

so I have restaurant experience.

And if he's figuring out my
Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.

But don't you think
it might be a little weird

to work for someone you used to date?

You work with Sheldon, you tell me.

Yeah, it's weird.

Okay, are you seriously jealous of me
working with Zack?

No, no! I'm not jealous.

I just think you have a good thing going
where you are right now,

and you make great money and you haven't
slept with any of your coworkers.

Great, so you want me to stay at a job
I'm not happy at.

Uh...

You okay? You kind of look like Zack
trying to figure out that tip.

Of course, I don't want you to be unhappy,

but I also want you to be smart.

And working for an ex-boyfriend
isn't very smart.

You don't have to stop,
just slow down, I'll jump out.

Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!

How did you get from croissants
to a unicycle?

I hurt myself juggling.

Where did you get it?

Howard said I could borrow it,
Bernadette said forever.

Have you tried letting go of the rope?

What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle!

All right, well, have fun.

Wait, I need help getting down.

Well, what do you want me to do?

Drag out our mattress
and put it over here.

Then go across the hall, get their
mattress and put it over here.

Yeah, but before you do any of that,
scratch my nose.

So, you told her she was being dumb?

No, I told her she was being "not smart."

Which was dumb.

Why did you even
go to dinner with the guy?

We covered this. I'm dumb.

So, he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares?

I can't believe
Leonard would be so insecure.

Really? I have no trouble
believing that at all.

And Zack's engaged,
Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.

We're talking about
the same Leonard, right?

So you think it's fine
if she works for Zack?

I don't know, maybe?

Well, he is much more attractive
than Leonard.

Yes, but that's gonna be true
of a lot of guys she works for.

Yeah, but she also
used to sleep with Zack.

Again.

I would never let Howard work with an ex.

What, you wouldn't trust him?

I wouldn't trust her.

He's thin and sexy
like a Jewish greyhound.

Yeah, that is the sexiest dog.

And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't
take a job I was uncomfortable with.

- Because he's scared of you?
- Terrified.

Yeah.

You know what,
I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.

Thank you.

I disagree.
Penny is a strong, independent woman.

The more you try to control her,
the more she'll push back.

So you think it's okay?

No. She's gonna leave you for someone,
might as well get it over with.

What are you doing?

I'm returning this stuff to Howard.

Oh, well, Bernadette made me promise
if you didn't want it,

we'd give it to a homeless clown.

What happened to learning the unicycle?

I stopped that, it was dumb.

Uni, bi, tri, menstrual,
all cycles are dumb.

You said juggling was dumb too.

Well, it is! If I wanted to hold three
things at once, I'd wear cargo pants.

Sheldon, is it possible that when things
get really difficult, you just give up?

Are you calling me a quitter?

Well, if you honestly--

This conversation is over.

His mother warned me.

Everybody warned me.

Actually, he warned me.

- Hey.
- Hi.

You wanna talk?

That doesn't seem to be where I shine.

How about I just give you one of these?

Look, we can have a reasonable
conversation, and I won't get mad.

I don't like it after sex,
and I don't like it now.

- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah.

Okay, just come here.

Look, I get me working with Zack is weird,
and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

Well, thanks. And I don't want you to be
stuck at a job you don't like.

What do we do?

Well, I don't love it, but if you
really want to take this job,

I'll find a way to deal with it.

No, I know you'll try,

but it'll make you miserable,
which will make me miserable, and...

I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.

No, no, no! You're unhappy there,

and then you're gonna blame me
for making you stay.

And it's fine, I'll just...
I'll suck it up.

You don't need to do that! It's okay.

Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like
I'm being selfish and holding you back.

What? Say something.

Yeah, that is pretty annoying.

I made you tea.

Thank you.

I'm sorry I called you a quitter.

It's okay,
I stopped being upset about that.

And no, the irony is not lost on me.

What are you reading?

This article says the peak age for making
a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.

- So?
- So I'm running out of time.

That's ridiculous. You're a brilliant man.

The best years of your life
are still ahead of you.

Oh, you have to say that,
you're sweet on me.

Well, if you're really worried
about your career,

maybe you should consider
spending a little less time

with video games and comic books.

Hey!

I thought you were sweet on me!

Okay, fine,
let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.

Let's say you spend your life
doing solid scientific research

surrounded by friends and loved ones
who appreciate you,

not for what you've accomplished
but for who you are as a man.

Wouldn't that be a life well lived?

You're so cute.

I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.

So many warnings.

Okay, are you sure about this?

Absolutely. ljust want you to be happy,

and maybe a little turned on
about how selfless I'm being.

Penny, what's up?

Hey, so, I've been thinking about it,
and I wanna take the job.

Oh, bad news.

When my fiancÃ©e found out that
I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend,

she said it was a stupid idea
and threw a shoe at me.

Oh. So there's no job?

Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.

Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.

Well, his fiancee thought the idea of us
working together was stupid.

You were right, I was wrong.

Aren't you gonna say anything?

Not if I wanna be doing this later.

Hey, I didn't know you were at home.
Where've you been?

I went to see your mom.

Seriously, where were you?

I just told you, your mom's.

<i>Why'?</i>

Well, since you find my magic tricks
so embarrassing,

I got to wondering
what cool hobbies you had as a kid.

Oh.

What'd she say?

She didn't say much of anything.

But she said a lot!

Hi, Bernadette, remember me?

First of all,
that's not what she sounds like.

She's from South Carolina.

I can't believe you made fun of me
all these years

while you were a closeted ventriloquist.

Okay, it's not like
I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

I was in beauty pageants,
and I needed a talent

besides spreading rumors
that the other contestants were pregnant.

Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of
all my stuff,

maybe we should throw
this little lady in the wood chipper.

No! And the little lady has a name.

Which is?

Tammy Jo Saint Cloud.

"Tammy Jo Saint Cloud."

And I'm a dork for juggling.

Sorry. You're not a dork.

You're a clown.

Tammy Jo, don't say that.
You'll make him feel bad.

Look at him.
What reason he got to feel good?

All right, very funny.

Don't listen to her,
she's been in a box for like, 25 years.

Yeah, back when his haircut
was fashionable.

(LAUGHING)

That's enough. Put her away.

Oh, Big Daddy, I don't think so.

You marry Ms. Bernie, you marry me.

We are family now.

You're freaking me out.

Don't be that way.

If you don't mind a few splinters,
we can have us a mÃ©nage Ã© trois.

Oh!

I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

I'm tall and I'm doing it!

(SNORTS)

Aw, man.

English-SDH

LEONARD: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

- What's this?
- Oh, nothing.

Just some math we don't need.

This is a different approach.

Are you trying to get the guidance system
even smaller?

It's just a theory.
It's not even worked out.

On. (CHUCKLES)

I want this.

But we've already met
the agreed-upon specs.

Going smaller would require
weeks' worth of new computations.

So get the kid with the two shirts
to do it.

(STAMMERING) Sir, if I may,

we've put a lot of thought and effort
into this current prototype.

It's a really elegant solution
and most importantly, it works.

You both make excellent points.

Thank you for presenting it
so articulately.

(CHUCKLES) Make this.

- Champagne, champagne.
- Thank you.

And for the world's tallest second-grader,
apple juice.

No bendy straw, some party.

(STUTTERS) A toast, thank you all
for your support

while we worked on our Air Force project

and please know that we could
not have done it without you.

- So, cheers!
- ALL: Cheers!

It's nice of you to acknowledge us,
but this is your accomplishment.

Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.

Without me.

To success without Raj.

(ALL CHEER)

So, what happens next?

Phase two, we test it, perfect it,
and hope to live long enough

to see the movie based on our lives
starring more attractive versions of us.

I'll definitely live long enough.
Vitamin C.

First thing tomorrow morning,
we're back at it.

Without me.

I hope his character doesn't make it
into the movie, he's kind of a bummer.

<i>AUTOMATED</i> VOICE: <i>Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.</i>

I don't care if this thing's
burning out my retinas,

it makes me feel special.

Before we field-test, I think--

- What the hell?
- Where is everything?

Who else has access to this room?

It's a secure lab
in a classified facility,

only the US Government and us.

This is very disconcerting.

But, the movie did just get good.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Sir, I'm sorry, but ljust don't get it,

you came into our lab
in the middle of the night

and took our prototype and all of our
research and didn't even tell us?

<i>Sounds like you get it.</i>

(SCOFFS) Why would you do that?

<i>You guys completed phase one,
we'll take it from here.</i>

Where did you move it?

<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

Are you implementing phase two?

<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

Wait, so you're just going to take
all the work we've done

for the last year and toss us aside?

<i>That one I can tell you. Yes.</i>

This is all very upsetting.

<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

<i>As you know, the primary focus</i>

<i>of the United States military
is people's feelings.</i>

If that's sarcasm,
please save it for our enemies.

I may be moving out soon.
I think I found a place to live.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Really?
You kept sending me apartment listings.

Um, well... Yeah, you got me.

- Where are you moving?
- And when? But also, where?

Bert has a room for rent.

So, you're gonna be roommates with Bert?

Uh, no, it's pretty private actually.

It's over his garage.

So, the only time I'll see him
is when he pulls his car in,

does his laundry or practices drums
in my dining room.

Well, good for you.
I actually have a little news myself.

Okay, we're just gonna circle back
to when he's moving out...

Okay, that's cool.

I was, uh, asked to be
a visiting researcher at Princeton.

- Hey, that's amazing.
- Congratulations.

Thanks, but the thing is
I'll be gone for a few months

and I don't know how
Sheldon's gonna feel about that.

Oh, come on, he's a grown man,
he can take care of himself.

You really believe that?

Once again, you got me. (SIGHS)

How can you work on something for a year
and they just take it?

I can't believe
the Air Force would treat us like that.

You know, I've a good mind
to stop paying my taxes.

It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.

The Air Force did it again!
They're erasing our lives.

Third floor, wrong apartment.

Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your
apartment and disappear, it'd be Penny.

She might disappear, but she's definitely
not cleaning anything.

It's okay, everything's here.

Hey, what's goin' on?

You won't believe it,
the military confiscated our project.

- What?
- You're kidding, why would they do that?

They wouldn't say.

I feel so betrayed.

All my life I thought Uncle Sam

was a friendly uncle
who brought you presents.

It turns out, he's the other kind.

Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

Thank you.
Can we just talk about something else?

Yeah, what's going on with you guys?

Give us some good news. (SIGHS)

Amy's got some news.

Yeah, um...

Raj is moving out.

Oh, no. When?

-(SIGHS)
- You doing okay?

Not really. (SCOFFS)

You want me to put on some Neil Diamond?
That always makes you feel better.

No, then you'll get all sexed up,
and I'm not in the mood.

I mean, an entire year wasted.

You might be forgetting another
accomplishment of the past year.

Oh. Yeah, yeah,
we brought life into the world.

Really? That's the importance
you put on us having a baby?

I'm happy about it,
but it's not like I did much.

I mean, after the first three minutes,
it was pretty much all you.

So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?

No, I'm waiting until he's in a good mood.

Oh. Sweetie, you might not live that long.

I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.

Oh, stop it. He'll be fine.

I guess. And he'll have you and Leonard
right across the hall the whole time.

Oh, damn. Wait, maybe you shouldn't go.

Gotta go. Morning.

I apologize for exceeding
my allotted bathroom time.

You feeling okay?

Not really. Apparently grief
can make one less regular.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

I sat and I sat, but to no avail.

Well, the more details, the more sorry.

Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.

I made your favorite oatmeal, plain.

What's the occasion?

No occasion, ljust wanted to do
something nice for you.

You're so kind.

Now, I don't know
how I ever got by without you.

That's sweet,
but you did just fine on your own.

I thought that too,
but I've come to realize

I am completely dependent on you.

Sheldon, you're being silly.

No, to wake up every morning

and know you're there
is a great comfort to me.

Mmm...

Tasteless.

How do you do it?

You know, what you need to do is
put this Air Force project behind you

and just dive into something new.

Well, there is our
quantum cognition experiment.

You and I could spend more time on that.

Oh, I don't know, I mean,
let's say we succeed

in proving that our consciousness
creates reality.

I mean, what will we
have really accomplished?

You know, a loaf of bread's
still three bucks.

I'm confused. You're always saying that
you want to spend more time with me.

That is true, I have said that.

Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

Has something changed?

Is there something
that you're not telling me?

I was offered a summer research fellowship
at Princeton.

Princeton, a fine institution.

The place where Albert Einstein taught

and where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

That's the one.

Well, that's wonderful, congratulations.

Well, I haven't accepted it yet,
I wanted to talk to you first.

Well, what is there to talk about?
You have to take it, it's important.

- So are you.
- Thank you, but I'll be fine.

Are you sure?

Yes. I may have lost my guidance system
and my girlfriend,

but I still have a colon full of
yesterday's meals to keep me company.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Although thanks to your
high-fiber breakfast,

I'm sure that'll be leaving me too.

Really? He doesn't put raisins
or banana slices or anything in it?

I don't think plain oatmeal
was the point of that story.

- I mean, I like a little brown sugar--
- Guys.

Sorry. You're still gonna go, right?

I don't know,
Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.

Oh, come on.
Look, if the roles were reversed,

he'd be on the first train to New Jersey

or the second train
if there were teenagers on the first one.

A little distance might be nice.

The last time a big project
ended for Howie,

he wouldn't stop following me around.

He even went with me to get a mammogram.

Well, what's wrong with that?

No, he wanted to get one with me,
like some kind of weird couple's massage.

And yet you bore his child, neato.

Well, you're excited
about this opportunity, right?

Of course,
I get to be a part of the first team

to use radon markers
to map the structures that--

Okay. A simple "yes" will do.

- You have to go.
- I know, but what if Sheldon--

Okay. Listen to me, your relationship can
handle being long-distance for a while.

It's not like you two are very physical.

You don't know
what goes on behind closed doors.

A lot of lectures?

All right, so you know.

I'm telling you, if you don't go,
you'll end up regretting it.

(PANTING) Hey! Wait up.

Oh, great.

(HUFFS) You left something at home.

- (CHUCKLES) A big hug!
- Oh!

I found it right next to these kisses.

(KISSING)

It's too late for me, save yourself.

So, are you excited
to have your own place again?

- I am, but I'll miss you guys.
- I know, we'll miss you too.

You could try saying that without smiling.

I'm trying, but this is the best I can do.

(HARMONICA PLAYING)

What are you doing?

What does it look like?

I'm playing sad harmonica

in an apartment as empty as my heart.

<i>Why'?</i>

I got the blues. My baby done left me.

Come on, Sheldon.

Amy's only gone for a few months.

And now that I'm moving out,
your old room is empty,

so you can stay there whenever you want.

Uh, could I talk to you
in the hall for a sec?

Yeah, sure.

Sheldon, you're being silly.

Am I?
Yesterday I had an Air Force project,

a girlfriend who lived with me and
my good friend Raj right across the hall.

You really care about that last one?

No, but that list
was sounding a little thin.

Well, instead of dwelling on the negative,
think about this.

Your girlfriend was given
an amazing opportunity,

which gives you an opportunity to show her

that you're a loving
and supportive boyfriend.

So, trick her.

All right, let me start again.
Uh, you and Amy--

<i>RAJ: Can I get my stuff?
Sounds like it's gonna be a while.</i>

- I missed you.
-(GASPS)

- Come here, let's talk.
- Ooh.

Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy?

- Am I gonna get a spanking--
- Just listen!

I don't know if you realize this,

but whenever you're between projects
you tend to get a little insecure.

- Oh.
- A little clingy.

I know, (CHUCKLES)
and I'm sorry.

Oh, oh! Okay, stop. Stop!

I love when you're affectionate,
but this is not coming from a good place.

Well, excuse me, but what did you do
when you worked on that allergy drug

for two years and the FDA
shut down your project?

I signed us up for ballroom dance class.

Okay. And what did you do when they
took you off the anti-fungal team?

I made us have a baby.

So?

- Bring it in.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

HOWARD: And now the movie
just got rated R.

Hey. You going somewhere?

No, but you are,
so I got you this as a present.

Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me

that I'm not always
a loving and supportive boyfriend,

so here's some quality luggage.

Thank you.

The salesman said
it could survive a plane crash, so...

Perhaps you should fly inside it.

Does this mean you're okay with me going?

Well, I'm not looking forward to it,

but it is a wonderful opportunity
and you need to take it.

Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey,

so it's not like
you're gonna want to stay.

Uh...

I know it's not your birthday,
but if you're interested--

- I am.
- Okay.

Oh, and just to be clear,

I'm not being intimate with you
in order to keep you from going.

I wasn't thinking that.

Well, no, I'm just warning you, you know,

if you find yourself 3,000 miles away
and craving a hit of this...

I can't skype it to you.

That's a risk I'm willing to take.

All right then, let's go to the bedroom,

remove our clothes, fold them neatly...

And engage in frenzied lovemaking.

What if we don't fold our clothes at all?

(STUTTERS) Or... What if We fold them?

- Well, here's your key back.
- Thank you.

Uh, soon as I have the place set up,
I'm gonna have you guys over.

Oh, we would love that.

I really can't thank you enough
for taking me in.

I was at a pretty low place in my life--

<i>SHELDON". Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.</i>

Anyway, uh, as I was saying,

I was at a pretty low place in my life

and if it wasn't for friends like you--

<i>AMY: My goodness, that form of stimulation
is highly efficient.</i>

I can't compete with that, bye.

Should we give them their privacy?

I want to, but I don't think I can.

-(SHELDON WHOOPS)
- Okay, I'm good now.

Okay, the car is waiting.
Do you wanna walk me downstairs?

Of course. Here, let me.

I've been doing a little research
on New Jersey,

and I was delighted to learn that
their chief agricultural product is sod.

- Is it?
- Yes. Yeah.

Perhaps I've been harder on them
than they deserve.

Do you think it's possible you might enjoy
being on your own for a little while?

Well, it's hard to say.
I've never really lived by myself.

What if I become strange and eccentric?

I'll love you no matter what.

Howard Hughes saved his urine
in milk bottles.

AMY: We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

You'll text me
when you arrive at the airport?

- I will. Uh-huh.
- When you're at the gate?

And if you see any actors
from Game of Thrones in first class?

I don't know what they look like,
but sure.

- Don't forget to skype me when you arrive.
- I won't.

- And every morning.
- Got it.

SHELDON: Now, of course my 9:00 a.m.
is your noon,

so let's avoid the whole
"good morning, good afternoon" minefield,

and let's just say, "Hello."

AMY: Good thinking.

And just remember, I'm proud of you
and I support you in all that you do.

Thank you, that means a lot.

Oh, and one last thing, if you find
yourself working with a male scientist

who's as smart as me, as tall as me,
and has hair like Thor,

well, then, I want you to step away from
the situation and call me immediately.

and I support you in all that you do.

Thank you, that means a lot.

Oh, and one last thing, if you find
yourself working with a male scientist

who's as smart as me, as tall as me,
and has hair like Thor,

well, then, I want you to step away from
the situation and call me immediately.

How are you settling in?

<i>Pretty well.
Princeton has a beautiful campus.</i>

You know, I've learned some fun facts
about New Jersey,

to help you make small talk.

Would you like to know the state bird
or the murder rate?

They're both shocking.

<i>Actually, I want to hear about you.</i>

<i>How are things at home?</i>

Well, I'm a lot less likely to see
an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered,

I'll tell you that.

<i>I miss you.</i>

I miss you, too.

<i>It's so strange, earlier today,
I ended a sentence with a preposition,</i>

<i>and you weren't there
to correct my grammar.</i>

I am sorry you had to go through that.

<i>In fact,
that's when I started to really miss you.</i>

You know you just split an infinitive.

<i>Did I? Are you going to teach me a lesson?</i>

lam!

It is naughty to put an adverb
between the word "to" and the verb stem.

<i>What are you going to do about it?</i>

I'm going to admonish you.

<i>Vigorously?</i>

That's the only kind of admonishing I do.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?

Well, the last three nights,
I've had to take him to get a haircut,

to the train store
and to a Walgreens in Arcadia,

where they still have
the "good ibuprofen."

Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.

- How are you doing with--
- Shut up.

If you'd like, we can help you out.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Oh, that would be great.

I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child,

but this one posts video of himself
flossing on Instagram.

It was a tutorial.

And yes,
I'm happy to keep Sheldon company.

Great, tonight he wants to look at ladders
at Home Depot.

Oh, why does he need a ladder?

He doesn't, he just likes looking at them,
bring a book.

Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki,
she's back at Caltech for her postdoc.

LEONARD: Hello.
RAJ: Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.

Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki is going to
tell me about the work she did at CERN.

And she brought me
this duty-free Toblerone.

(CHUCKLES) on, <i>I</i> love those!

Let's sit somewhere else.

What just happened?

A stranger just lured Sheldon away
with a candy bar.

Isn't she the grad student
that used to follow him around?

Oh, yeah, back before he hit puberty
and grew man parts.

(LEONARD CHUCKLES)

So, what do you guys think that's about?

Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

So, tell me about
your scalar dark energy experiment.

Not till you tell me about
your latest paper on quantum loop theory.

Oh. You must be one of those
dessert-before-dinner people.

(CHUCKLES)

He just made her laugh, something's wrong.

Do you see the way she's looking at him?

Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.

I keep telling you,
close the bathroom door.

Oh, did you see that?

She just touched his hand
and he didn't swat it away.

What is happening?

Okay, the simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

- Which is?
- That ain't Sheldon.

Not only did they eat together,
Leonard said he made her laugh!

That's nothing,
Howie said she touched his hand.

What? Did he Purell?

No.

I cannot believe Leonard
mentioned the Toblerone,

but left that part out.

Should we call Amy?

I don't know,
we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.

I guess we could wait
till we have more information

-about this girl.
- Yeah. (SIGHS)

Do you think living with Amy has somehow
stirred up Sheldon's sexual appetite?

Ugh!

How can you think that?

Why would you even
put those words together?

All right, then we agree,
he's not making any moves,

it's this Dr. Ramona chick.

Nowitzki. I googled her,
she's pretty cute.

Really? All I got from Leonard was,
"The Toblerone bar had nuts."

Oh! And get this, I saw an articulating
ladder with dual-leg leveling,

which delivers stability
and adaptability to uneven terrain.

<i>Sounds like a big night.</i>

Raj made the funniest joke, he said,

"Which is the best ladder to use
to hang myself?" (LAUGHS)

<i>So you're keeping busy, you're not lonely?</i>

Not at all. No, I've had outings with
Leonard and Raj in the evening,

and, Oh, I had lunch with Dr. Nowitzki.

<i>Who's he?</i>

Oh, no, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.

<i>Oh, really? When did you meet her?</i>

Many years ago,
back when she was a grad student.

She's always been a huge fan of my work,
and now she's doing research at Caltech.

<i>"Huge fan" you say?</i>

Yes. I think you'd like her.

She's extremely intelligent,
just like you.

Unlike you, she's tall, blonde
and used to be an Olympic swimmer.

<i>That's terrific, I'll call you right back.</i>

(RING-TONE PLAYING ON LAPTOP)

<i>'9â. 'Hey, Amy.
'l gave you one job!</i>

<i>Keep an eye on him! How hard is that?</i>

We thought you meant
not letting him run out into traffic.

Which he only did once.

<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

We didn't want you to worry.

<i>Should I worry?</i>

No, come on, it's Sheldon,
nothing is going to happen.

<i>That's what you said to me
when I started dating him.</i>

<i>And then five years later,
bingo-bango, something happened!</i>

Yeah, but you're going to be back
in three months.

<i>(SIGHS) You don't get it.</i>

<i>I've been smacking that ketchup bottle
for a long time.</i>

<i>All she's got to do is tip it over
and point it at her fries!</i>

What do you want us to do?

<i>I don't know!</i>

<i>Might be the New Jersey talking,</i>

<i>but this Nowitzki broad
needs to disappear.</i>

That's ridiculous.

As far as we know, all that happened is
two scientists had lunch.

<i>Yeah, but one of those scientists is
a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer!</i>

Oh, come on, looks don't
matter to Sheldon.

Because he only has eyes for you.

<i>- Nice</i> try.
- Thanks, I was scrambling.

It's unbelievable.

Sheldon has lunch with another woman,
and somehow my wife yells at me.

Penny laid into me, too.

Apparently, I'm overly fixated
on premium Swiss chocolate bars.

Can you even eat those things?

Mmm, if I take a LACTAID a half-hour
before and some Pepto right after.

Sounds like a lot of work.

Ha, I'm worth it.

Guys, focus.
Should we do something about Nowitzki?

- Like what?
-(RAJ SIGHS)

Uh, well, she's single,
so if somebody else asks her out,

and she says yes,
then we know she's not into Sheldon.

I'll do it.

No offense, Stuart,
but the woman's a doctor.

So? Doctors like me.

Whenever I see mine, he calls in
a bunch of other doctors to have a look.

She's not that kind of doctor.

Oh. Well, her loss.

I have been called
"a genuine medical oddity."

- Actually, I was going to suggest me.
-(SCOFFS)

Great, anybody's better than... (MUMBLES)

Excuse me, they took out my spleen
and gallbladder, not my feelings.

(EXHALES AND CLEARS THROAT)

- Dr. Nowitzki, good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

May I join you?

No.

Good to see you.

We should call Guinness,
that might be a record.

She's clearly having a working lunch
and preferred to eat alone.

Dr. Cooper, over here!

I could have made her very happy.

You kept walking, I think you did.

You really think
there's reason to worry?

Yeah, she's definitely
going after Sheldon.

(SIGHS) I made a play for her,
and she shot me down.

All right, well,
that doesn't prove anything.

Yeah, there's a million reasons
a woman would shoot Raj down.

Like, really, a million?

Fine, hundreds.

Thank you.

The point is, this could be nothing
and we are all overreacting.

Hey, everybody, this is my friend,
Dr. Nowitzki.

Hi.

ALL: Hi.

We just went swimming.

You actually got in a pool?

I was scared,

but I told myself,
"It's just a big bathtub."

Then I got scared again
'cause there are all these strangers

-in my bathtub.
-(CHUCKLES)

I was proud of him.

A lot of people don't put
their face in the water on the first day.

I was hiding from a bee,
but it still counts.

Can ljust squeeze in here?

So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?

Yes, we skyped this morning,

and I'm sure I'll check in with her
before I go to sleep.

Sheldon talks about her all the time.

I can't wait to meet her.

No... That is true,

she keeps asking
how long Amy's going to be gone.

Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself,
do you have a boyfriend?

Leonard! Your wife is sitting right here,
what are you doing?

No, my work doesn't leave me a lot of time
for relationships.

I think you made that very clear.

She was part of the American team at CERN.

I had a front-row seat
when they detected the Higgs boson.

Do you know,
I've corresponded with Peter Higgs.

Would you like to see some of his letters?

- Absolutely.
- I'll get them.

Well, hang on, I'll come with you.

Oh, fun, like a playdate.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,

but isn't that exactly what we were
supposed to stop from happening?

I threw my body at them!

What else did you want me to do?

(PENNY SIGHS)

You think you should call Amy?

You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.

Here you go.

Are these all from Peter Higgs?

Oh, no, no.
They're from many famous people.

See? Oh, like this one.
This is from Patrick Stewart.

It says if I come to his house again,
I get to meet his dogs.

(CHUCKLES)

(RING-TONE PLAYING ON LAPTOP)

Oh, excuse me.

<i>- Hello, Sheldon.
- Oh, hello, Amy.</i>

<i>I was missing you again.</i>

I miss you, too. Hey! This is good timing.

You remember that Dr. Nowitzki
I told you about?

She's right here!

<i>(STUTTERS) She's what?</i>

Hello.

<i>Hi.</i>

So nice to meet you.

<i>Uh-huh.</i>

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

<i>Hang on. Hello?</i>

<i>Little late, Leonard!</i>

<i>Sorry.</i>

What is Leonard doing
calling you at this hour?

<i>It's not important.</i>

I must tell you,
that seems a little inappropriate.

- Don't you agree?
- I do.

See?

We both think so.

All right, this is making me crazy.
Somebody's got to go over there.

You've got feet and legs, you do it.

Will you go with me?

To do what,
shake a can of nickels at them?

We're being ridiculous.

There's no way a woman that attractive
is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.

You done
trying to make yourself feel better?

No, I haven't played the race card yet.

Hey. I hate to break up the party,

but Amy says I'm tired
and have to go to bed.

It was nice seeing everybody.
Thank you for dinner.

- Sure.
- Pleasure.

Whatever.

- Walk me to my car?
- Of course.

We'll all go!

Excuse me.

Pardon, ljust need to... Yeah.

(CHUCKLES) That was fun, like <i>Mario Kart.</i>

Bye.

We need to talk.

Is this about Leonard and Amy?
I don't like it either.

Okay, I know you don't have
a lot of experience with women,

but Ramona
seems to have a romantic interest in you.

That doesn't make any sense,
she knows I have a girlfriend.

Well, sometimes women don't care.

Sometimes it makes them want a guy
even more.

Look, that may be true,
but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend.

In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed
she's a woman

if she hadn't worn that bathing suit
that highlighted her bosom.

Okay, um, (CLEARS THROAT)
let's try this,

think of yourself as one of those
limited edition toys

people like to collect.

I already do.

Well, then you get it.

Oh! Because there's only one of me,
I'm more valuable.

Right.

Although,

Amy's already taken me out of my package
and played with me.

Let's forget the toy thing, okay?
Uh, maybe--

Penny, look, I appreciate your concern,
but I don't think that's what's happening.

All right, what do you think is happening?

I think Dr. Nowitzki
is a friendly colleague.

I think you and Leonard
need to see a marriage counselor.

And I need to update my resume
to include swimming as a special skill.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Don't look at me like that, I tried!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey, did you eat yet?

Ah, breakfast, yes, lunch, no.

I did have a cough drop,

but that really rides the line
between sucking and eating.

Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.

How thoughtful.

- Thank you.
- No big deal,

I enjoy spending time with you.

And <i>I</i> with you.

Question.

Are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

What if I were?

Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

We're colleagues, I'm currently in a--

Excuse me a moment.

(CHUCKLES)

<i>-(KNOCKING)
- Amy? Amy. Amy.</i>

Will you marry me?

English-SDH

LEONARD: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

A fine institution.

The place where Albert Einstein taught.

And where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

Gentlemen, you may remember
Dr. Nowitzki,

she's back at Caltech for her post-doc.

- RAMONA: Hello. (CHUCKLES)
- ALL: Hi.

Question,

are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

What if I were?

Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

We're colleagues,
I'm currently in a--

SHELDON: Amy. (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Amy. Amy.

Will you marry me?

(SHELDON'S CELL PHONE RINGING)

One moment please.

Really, you're gonna
answer that right now?

It's Leonard, I don't want to be rude.

- Hello?
- Hey, where you been?

We've been calling you for hours.

I'm sorry,
my phone was on airplane mode.

Why?

Because I was on an airplane.

(MOUTHING)

Hey, put him on speaker.

- Yeah.
- Hey. Where are you?

SHELDON: <i>I</i> came to Princeton to see Amy.

(CHUCKLES) It's a funny story actually.

I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki

-and she kissed me.
- Excuse me?

Rm sorry?

Wait, and in that moment I realized that

Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss

for the rest of my life.

So, I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

- Oh, that's so sweet.
-(CHUCKLES)

Sheldon.

Yeah, although there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

I've thought about it

and I really wanna spend
the rest of my life with Amy.

Do I have your blessing?

<i>Well, Sheldon,</i>

<i>I think you should make
her finger like Saturn</i>

<i>and put a ring on it.</i>

You asked Stephen Hawking
and not her father?

Stephen Hawking's a genius.

If he said no, I wasn't gonna waste
my time on her father.

But you did ask my father?

- Mm-hmm, I did, he said, "Yes."
-(GASPS)

Although not in a robot voice
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

Okay, oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys are engaged!

<i>SHELDON: We're not engaged yet,</i>

she's taking forever to answer.

Because you're on the phone!

We'll call you back.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

<i>SHELDON: She said, "Yes."</i>

- Yay! (SCREAMS)
- Congratulations!

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Mother, I have some good news to share.

We're engaged! (CHUCKLES)

I am so happy for you two.
But I'm not surprised.

I've been praying for this.

Well, God had nothing to do with it.

It happened because
I was kissing another woman

and it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

More than one woman
was interested in you?

I might have prayed a little too hard.

(STUTTERS) I just-- I wanna
let you know right now

that we are not getting married
in a church.

That's all right, Sheldon,
anywhere Jesus is is a church.

Well, he won't be at our wedding.

He's in my heart,
so if I'm there he'll be there.

Okay, well, then he's your plus one,
you don't get to bring anyone else.

That's fine, love you.

All right, love you too, bye.

Lord, thank you.

(SIGHS) Even though you can do anything,
that was mighty impressive.

We're engaged.

Oh, my God, that's amazing!

(STUTTERS) Wait, tell me everything.

Well, Dr. Nowitzki was kissing me--

Oh, you can stop leading
with that part of the story.

Well, congratulations,
I'm so happy for you two.

Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette.

Hey, Bernie, guess what,

Sheldon and Amy got engaged!
Can you believe it?

Oh, my God.

I cannot believe it.

She's so happy,
I think she's crying. (LAUGHS)

Do you think Sheldon's gonna want
some weird Star Trek wedding?

I don't know.

Well, Leonard could barely finish
the words "Doctor Who wedding cake"

before I shut that down hard.

Mm-hmm.

Are you listening to me?

Yeah, you're mean to Leonard,
I heard you.

Is everything okay?

(SIGHS SOFTLY) Look, I'm gonna
tell you something,

but you can't freak out,
because I'm already freaking out.

Oh, my God, what is it?

(SIGHS) I'm pregnant again.

Wha--

Interesting.

Howard's gonna lose his mind.

Wait, you haven't told him yet?

- No.
- So you told me first?

Oh, Bernie.

This wasn't supposed to happen.
We were careful.

I didn't even think you could get
pregnant while you were breastfeeding.

Well, guess what, you can.

Hey, look, this is a good thing.

Hailey's gonna have
a little brother or sister to play with.

I guess that would be pretty cute.

And, you know,
I was a surprise to my parents,

and my dad said it was the best thing
that ever happened to them.

Okay, maybe this baby
actually is a blessing.

Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.
(CHUCKLES)

- How am I pregnant again?
- Yeah, what were you thinking?

All right.
I'm all checked into my flight.

Well I'm sad you're leaving,

Why'd you only book a flight
for one day?

I came here to propose.

If you'd said "No;-

I wouldn't want to stick around
looking at your stupid face.

Now, mind you, your face is only stupid
in the "no" version of the story.

But I said, "Yes,"
so I get a lifetime of this.

Yes, you do, smart face.

Why don't you stay a few extra days?

Well, I don't have any other clothes.

We'll get you some.

I don't know, I'm pretty particular.

Well, there's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

Perfect, let's go shopping.

Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight,

I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

- Aw.
- Come on. What do you say?

Aw, you're nagging me.

It's like we're already married.

- Is that a "yes" or a "no"?
- Geez, save some for the honeymoon.

Look at Nowitzki over there.

Can't believe she tried to steal
Sheldon from Amy.

You know what? I'm gonna go there
and tell her that they're engaged now

and that her little plan didn't work.

Because you're sticking up for Sheldon,

or because you're still mad
she rejected you?

Too far away, can't hear you.

- Hello, Ramona.
- Hello.

Why are you sitting by yourself?

Oh, that's right, Sheldon's
in New Jersey, being engaged to Amy.

I heard.

Now that Sheldon's out of the picture,

I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

Nope, I'm good.

You sure?

I will not ask again.

I sincerely hope not.

Very well. I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

Hey. Want me to make dinner?

All right. Sure, but first,
why don't you have a seat.

There is something I need to show you.

Ooh, if it's "How to make dinner"
that'd be great. (LAUGHS)

(SIGHS)

Is this a...

pregnancy test?

Yes.

That means...

positive?

Yes.

No.

- Yes.
- Oh, no, no. (LAUGHS)

Yes.

No.

How could this even happen?

(STUTTERS) I mean, we were careful.

Well, it did.

- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

Okay, okay, okay, (GASPS) well, wh--
what are-- what are we gonna do?

What do you mean,
"What are we gonna do?"

We're gonna have another baby.

- No.
- Stop that!

- No! I'm trying!
- Yes.

(SIGHS) Look, I know it's scary,

but we're both responsible adults,

we can do this.

(SIGHS) You really think so? (SIGHS)

Yeah.

No!

Hey, Stuart.

Oh, hey, Raj, what can I help you with?

I need to buy an engagement gift.

Well, you came to the wrong place.

(CHUCKLES) It's for Sheldon and Amy.

No way, they're engaged?

- Yeah.
- Ah, that's exciting news.

Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy
would be the next two to tie the knot.

Tell me about it.
I'm the one who caught the bouquet

at Leonard and Penny's wedding.

Okay, uh, you know,

they might like this,

Superman and Wonder Woman.
It's kinda romantic.

Mm.

You know what,

why am I buying them a gift?

They have love,
screw them and their happiness.

What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

Literally, everything.

Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

- Hello.
- Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,

this is my fiancÃ©,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

That's the first time I've said that
and it kinda gave me the goosebumps.

Dr. Cooper, we are so excited
to meet you. (CHUCKLES)

Oh, well that's very kind of you.

If you'd like, I could
autograph your menus after dinner. Yeah.

But I better not see those on eBay.

(DR. ZANE LAUGHS)

No, no, no. We're, we're just excited

to meet the man
who landed this brilliant woman here.

-(CHUCKLES)
- Oh, that wasn't hard,

she threw herself at me.

Now getting the universe
to show me its naughty bits,

that took some doing.

Sheldon's a physicist.

- Oh.
- That's nice.

Amy, I recently read your paper

on lesions in the olfactory receptors
in the brain.

(SIGHS) It was inspired.

(CHUCKLES)
Well, I guess it didn't stink.

But if it did, that rat wouldn't
have known it. (CHUCKLES)

(DR. ZANE LAUGHS)

(STUTTERS) I'm sorry, I'm sure
you don't wanna sit here

and listen to a bunch of work talk.

Oh, no, I love it. (STUTTERS)
Let's talk about work.

<i>Amy's work, my work,</i>

yeah, why don't we start with my work?

Actually, I do have a question
for Dr. Cooper.

When Amy first told you
about her approach to synaptic tracing,

did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

(STUTTERS) Really,

that's your question?

<i>What are you, Entertainment Tonight?</i>

You know what? (STUTTERS)
I'm gonna give you a better question.

Here, "Dr. Cooper,

"I heard you were working on a top
secret project for the U.S. Military,

"why don't you tell us about that?"

See, that's a great question.

Okay, what was that like?

Well, I can't tell you that,
it's top secret.

Boy, that was exhausting.

And no offense, but your colleagues
were pretty rude.

- Really, they were rude?
- Yes,

they just kept talking about you
and how great you are

no matter how many times
I brought me up.

Well, these are my colleagues,
and they wanna talk about my work,

why does that bother you so much?

Because I was there.

It's like having Optimus Prime
over to dinner

and not asking him to turn into a truck.

You know what, Sheldon?

You're not always the smartest person
in every room.

You may not even be the smartest person
in this room.

Oh, I am sorry.

What, is Neil Degrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

Because if he is, he's not that smart.
It's pretty dusty back there.

Hey, where are you going?

I'm storming off to my room.

Wait, then where am I supposed
to storm off to?

Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

(DOOR CLOSES)

ls there another bedroom?

Perhaps (STUTTERS) a den?

So, how are you guys doin'
with all the new events in your womb?

Good, you know,
obviously it was a surprise.

There was some crying
and some yelling--

Some suggestion of make-up sex

that did not go over well even though
it's not like we can get more pregnant.

But then we realized
that it's a gift, in the sense that

we didn't ask for it,
and we may not have chosen it--

(CHEWING) And we already have one.

You know, whenever I find a top I like

I always go back and get a second one
in a different color.

Which I hope is not the case
with your baby.

Uh, uh, I know you guys are freaked out
but you're great parents

and if you ever need help
we are here for you.

Yeah. Anything at all, just ask.

Well, you know what you could do?

You could have a baby, too.

I'm sorry, what?

Well, that's a great idea.
We could go through it together,

wouldn't that be fun?

(SCOFFS)

You guys were just saying
how freaked out and miserable you are.

I say a lot of crazy things,
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

Do it, have a baby, do it!

Come on, it'd be so cute,
our kids playing together.

What do you say? Why don't you two hit
the old mattress and whip up a family?

Okay, we're not gonna have a baby
just to make you guys feel better.

Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby
it's gonna be when we are ready

or when I'm certain
Penny's gonna leave me.

Exactly.

They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

And I'm trying,

but, all I feel is this, like,
gnawing empty sensation in my gut.

- I had that once.
- Hmm.

Turned out it was a tapeworm.

Cool, uh...

It's just--

It's hard talking
to my other friends about this,

but I knew you would understand.

- Why is that?
- Because you and I are both alone,

which is actually kind of comforting

Because at least
we can be alone together.

(INHALES) Hmm, this is,
this is awkward. I, um,

I was actually gonna <i>close</i> up a little
early tonight 'cause I have a date.

- Really?
- Yeah.

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

Don't be silly, I'm lovin' your pain.

Is this how our marriage is going to be?

Sometimes people will be more interested
in talking to her than to me?

<i>Are you sitting in a bathroom?</i>

(SIGHS) Yes,

I needed a place to storm off to
and it was all that was available.

<i>Fine, but if I hear a flush</i>

<i>this conversation is over.</i>

Those people were in the presence
of a world-class mind

and all they wanted to talk about
was their own nonsense.

<i>Can you see the irony in that statement?</i>

STEPHEN HAWKING: How about now?

<i>HAWKING: How about now?</i>

<i>I'll wait.</i>

Oh, surprise.

Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

No. Wait.

- No.
- No. Okay.

All right, so what are we celebrating?

Well, Bernadette and Howard
are pregnant again,

Amy and Sheldon are getting married,

I didn't want you to feel left out.

Oh.

Left out?

Well, Bernadette has to grow
a baby inside of her

and Amy has to marry one.
My life is great!

(LAUGHS)

- So do you not want the cake--
- Try and take it away, see what happens.

Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.

Happy anniversary!

Amy...

There's something I need to say to you.

I'm listening.

(SIGHS)

I've been thinking about The Avengers.

I believe that,

but I don't think that's something
you needed to say to me.

(SIGHS)

I realized that Iron Man is great.

And also, that Captain America is great.

And sometimes Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie

and he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

Now he can fly in, give the audience
a thrill, and then fly away.

And that should have been me tonight.

I should have been
the delightful cameo in your movie.

Thank you, Sheldon.

Instead, I was like the Hulk and I--

Okay, please stop talking
about The Avengers.

Anyway,

I'm proud of you

and I'm going to try to do a betterjob
of sharing the spotlight

because we're a team,

you know, much like...

The Dodgers.

If they had superpowers.

And fought crime.

And Thor was in them.

Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,

but, you'll have a whole lifetime
to practice.

It could take that long,
I'm really bad at it.

You know, maybe, um...

I should start right now

and go back to Pasadena and let you have
this experience to yourself.

You just want to go back

'cause that's where everybody
makes a fuss over you.

You know, your colleagues are right,
you are brilliant.

Hello.

- Hey!
- Mm, hey, welcome back!

Oh, (STUTTERS) let me see the ring.

RAJESH: Ooh, nice.

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
her eyes are up there.

(CHUCKLES)

I-is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?

Uh.

- Could be.
- Hard to say.

Tell us about Princeton.

- Excuse me for a minute.
- Yeah. No, we'll catch up later.

This is going to be
the biggest smackdown

since my Aunt Noopur
showed up at the family reunion

wearing the same sari
as my cousin Shruti.

Dr. Nowitzki.

Oh. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Dr. Fowler,

hello.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

One dumpling left. Who wants it?

Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

And that would be?

Me, Sheldon, I'm obviously pregnant.

Well, you never said it to my face,

and the last time I assumed a woman
was pregnant, it did not go over well.

Yeah, I'm still mad at you.

You were drinking water instead of wine,

what was I supposed to think?

Sheldon's right. I would never ask
a woman if she was pregnant

unless she tells me, or I see
a human being wiggling out of her.

Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.

Congratulations! How far along are you?

About three months.

Only three?

Good gravy,
how many babies are in there?

Okay, let's talk about something
that won't infuriate my pregnant wife.

I read an interesting fact
about elephants.

Try again.

Oh, I've got something. I'm being
interviewed on public radio this Friday.

Oh, cool. How come?

The university's trying to get
more funding for the physics department,

<i>so</i> they want me to go out
and talk it up.

Really, you?

Well, they picked the right person
for the job.

Thank you.

I think he bought it.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

Joining me today is my guest physicist
Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

to talk about all of the exciting
research they're doing at Caltech.

Thank you for having me. Whoa.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

I never get used to hearing
myself in headphones.

Is that really how I sound?

(CHUCKLES)

It is, it is.

(HEAVY VOICE) That is good to know.

I told him his voice was annoying,
he didn't wanna listen.

Hey!

What, you're saying it's not?

Just, hey.

So it has been five years
since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

What's the next big thing gonna be?

(LIGHT CHUCKLE) Wow, that's hard to say,
there's so much going on.

We've been collecting tons of data

that could revolutionize
the way we understand the universe.

Uh, for instance,
there's a particle called a squark,

which could prove supersymmetry!

That is interesting. Have you found it?

- What, the squark?
- Yes.

No, no.

Wouldn't that be exciting?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

But we're also looking for
the selectron,

the gluino, and the neutralino.

- And have you found that?
- No.

But, uh, fun side note,

I went to high school
with a girl named Theresa Gluino.

But it didn't cost
two billion dollars to find her.

She was smoking behind the gym.
(CHUCKLES)

So, what have you found?

Um, nothing actually.

Should he be saying that?

Probably not.

Yeah, this is public radio.

Doesn't he realize
dozens of people might hear him?

But, I remain confident.

We've got the best equipment,
and the best minds all working on it.

Okay, sounds like he's back on track.

Although, some days I'm like,

"Ugh, we've spent so much money.

Why haven't we found anything?
What are we doing?"

Oh, boy.

There's Leonard. I bet he's having
a rough day. (CHUCKLES)

Let's just try to be supportive.

Supportive?

He publicly maligned
the love of my life, Lady Physics.

Might not want to mention that
to Lady FiancÃ©e.

Hell, guys.

- HOWARD: Hey.
- RAJESH: Hey. How's it goin'?

<i>PH .</i>

What? You got something to say?

I think I just said it.

P.F.F.

<i>PH .</i>

- I...
- Look, I, I was just speaking the truth.

Yeah, we're scientists,
isn't that what we're supposed to do?

Oh, what would you know about the truth?

You thought Phantom Menace
was "not half bad."

I told you that in confidence!

Okay, calm down, everybody.
Just cool it.

No, let 'em go. if we get lucky,
maybe one of them'll start crying.

Can we just drop this
and have lunch like adults?

- Sure.
- Very well.

- Leonard?
- What?

<i>PH .</i>

- You ready for lunch?
- Oh, one second.

Ooh, someone's got a lot of
fancy new lab equipment.

I know. The university's been
throwing money at my study.

With any luck, there'll be
a brain disease with my name on it.

Fingers crossed.

Which is ironic,
because if you had Fowler's Palsy,

you wouldn't be able
to cross your fingers.

I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here
playing with all your new toys.

Actually, I haven't told him about it.

We've been getting so much more funding
than physics,

he's been a little sensitive.

So you're just gonna
hide your success from him?

(SIGHS) I know, am I terrible?

No, I do that too!

Howie thought
my company retreat was in Boise.

It was in Tahiti.

That's such a relief.

I mean, part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

Take that part of yourself
and hide it away.

Just like I did with last year's
bonus check that I "didn't get."

-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-(DOOR OPENS)

- Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor Hofstadter, come on in.

Should I sit or stand?

I'm not used to being called
into the Dean's office.

Please sit.

I have to say, I'm a little nervous.

You should be.

Look, I know I screwed up.

But it was only one interview.

How much damage could it have caused?

Would you like for me
to read you the emails

from donors asking
why are they giving us money

if physics is a dead end?

I didn't say it was a dead end.

I just said that
I was worried it might be.

So, if I just said I was worried
you might not have a job next week,

how would you feel?

Light-headed
and glad you asked me to sit down.

Okay, just tell me what I can do.

I'm gonna need you to make a statement
saying that you misspoke,

and that you're confident
the physics community

is close to a major breakthrough.

You want me to lie?

Look, Doctor Hofstadter,
I'm counting on you.

I think that you are the
smartest physicist at this university.

- Really?
- See? Lies. They're not that hard.

- Hi.
- Hello.

Oh.

Looks like you've been busy.

Oh, I have.

(STUTTERS) Dark matter, reconciling
gravity and quantum mechanics,

supersymmetry.

I figured out
the biggest problems in physics today.

Wow, you solved them all?

No, I just-- I figured out
that they're the biggest problems.

Is this about what Leonard said
on the radio?

Uh, absolutely not.

And I do not want to talk about Leonard.

Can we please
just talk about anything else?

We could talk about my day.

Walked right into that one, didn't I?

Well, since you sort of asked,

I actually had a very good day.

I got some new equipment for my lab.

Well, congratulations.

I got some new equipment, too.

I got these markers.

They smell like fruit,

which I did not notice
when I bought them.

(GASPS LIGHTLY)
Don't really care for it.

(SIGHS)

Here, drink this.

It might help.

- What if it doesn't?
- No, that's why I brought the bottle.

No one would talk to me in the halls,
they just glared at me.

It's like high school all over again.

Oh, I would totally do high school
all over again.

But that doesn't help you.

I got called into
the administration office.

Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.

We don't technically have a principal,

there's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.

Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions nobody asked.

Oh, come on, look, you said
a few dumb things on the radio.

What is the worst that could happen?

I may get fired.

Okay, well, even if you did,
you could find another job.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Yeah, who wouldn't
wanna hire the physicist

who publicly said physics is dead.

Well, I wouldn't put that
under special skills.

Look, I can fix it. I just need to
write a retraction I don't believe in.

Basically sell out to keep my job.

Great, I'll leave you to it.

Hmm.

Hmm.

<i>Oy.'</i>

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

LEONARD: Sheldon, <i>it's</i> me.

- What?
- Look, I know you're mad,

but I have to write a statement

that says the physics community
is close to a breakthrough.

And since you actually believe that,
I could really use your help.

- Sorry, I can't.
- Come on, don't be like that.

I can't, because I think you were right.

- What?
- Look, (SIGHS)

not all science pans out.

You know, we've been hoping
supersymmetry was true for decades,

and finally we built
the Large Hadron Collider,

which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles,

but it hasn't.

Maybe supersymmetry,
our last big idea, is simply wrong.

That sounds awful.

Now I get why everyone hates me.

On the bright side,

after working together for 15 years,

you finally get to hear me say
you were right.

Yeah, you did.

How's it feel?

Given I might be unemployed,
bittersweet.

Read it back to me.

Hang on.

(SIGHS) "Yes, one might question
the 20 billion dollars

"to build and run
the Large Hadron Collider,

"but on the other hand..."

Okay, um...

Oh, oh! On the other hand,
contrary to predictions,

the Collider didn't create
a small black hole

that devoured the Earth
and life as we know it.

So, (STUTTERS) money well spent.

This is depressing.

Do you have any alcohol around here?

Oh, not surprisingly, when Penny
moved out, she took every last drop.

Oh, but I do have several bottles
of Romulan Ale

that I bought at Comic-Con.

Isn't that just vodka
with blue dye in it?

First physics, now Romulan Ale.

What else would you like to defecate on?

Hey, I thought you were
coming right back.

I was, but we're both depressed

and decided to drown our sorrows.

In mouthwash?

Man, that is so summer camp.

It's Romulan Ale from Star Trek.

It was briefly legalized
during the alliance

between the Romulan Empire

and the Federation at the time
of the Dominion War.

Aw, now I'm depressed.

The more I told him about my lab,
the pissier he got.

You know what he said to me?

He said, "I hope all your correlations
turn out to be specious."

He said that to your face?

What a dick.

You know, you're a successful woman,

you should be able to brag about
your accomplishments once in a while.

And so should you.

I mean, the guys are never shy
about bragging.

Tell me about it.

Howie texts me every time
his dog levels up in Warcraft.

Has he ever called you to tell you
he found three peanuts in one shell?

'Cause Sheldon has.

We should be able to do that, too.

I guess we can brag to each other.

That's a great idea.

Damn right it is. I came up with it.

(CHUCKLES)

That felt good! (CHUCKLES)

You know, there's so much money
in pharmaceuticals,

we don't even wash out our test tubes.

We just throw 'em out and get new ones.

I just got a brand-new,
state-of-the-art FMRI machine.

- Those things are so expensive.
- I know.

Sometimes I just lie down in there
and take a nap.

It's like a million dollar bunk bed.

At the office, I have two assistants.

I don't even know their names.
I just call 'em Thing One and Thing Two.

That's great. I don't have assistants.

I guess that's one of the benefits
of being in the private sector.

That and all the money I make.

Yeah, you've got that.

I've got my integrity,
hard to say which is better

without making you feel bad.

Okay, so you guys are upset

because the Collider thing
disproved your theories?

L-it's worse than that.

It hasn't found anything in years,

so we don't know if we're right,
we don't know if we're wrong,

we don't know where to go next.

All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed Avatar.

Come on, you guys are physicists, okay?

You're always gonna be physicists,

and sure, sometimes the physics is hard.

But isn't that what makes it boring?

- RAJESH: Hey.
- We're here. (SIGHS)

- HOWARD: What's <i>going</i> on?
- Okay. As far as I can see,

science is dead
'cause Leonard killed it.

And I don't know who the Romulans are,

but those guys know how to party.

So, what do you want us to do?

I don't know. You're scientists,
cheer them up!

Cheer them up?
Do you even know what a scientist is?

No, we don't need to be cheered up.

It just turns out that
physics is exactly like <i>Lost.</i>

Started out great, and turns out
just a big ol' waste of time.

Boo-hoo. You know what
you sound like? Babies.

Two whiny babies.

There's nothing worse than
being stuck with two whiny babies!

Oh.

Oh, my God. I'm gonna have two babies.

No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Babies are great.

You're lucky to have two babies.

I mean look at me, uh, I'm all alone.
I'm never gonna have babies

'cause you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.

Thanks for coming.

I may not make as much money as you,

but at least I know that
I'm actually doing something

that makes people's lives better.

Hey, my work makes
people's lives better,

especially if you have moderate
to severe eczema

and don't mind a few loose teeth.

You're right, we both do important work.

I'm trying to map the structures
of the brain,

and you're trying to convince people
that itchy hair is a real thing.

It is a real thing!

It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

I'm just saying that my research
may actually change the world forever.

I hope it does,

'cause I'm gonna see that world
from a yacht so big

you can land a helicopter on it.

Physics is all we're cut out for.

I mean, if we weren't physicists,
what would we be?

I don't know, popular? (CHUCKLES)

RAJESH: Mm-hmm.

It's fine, I don't need to be
a theoretical physicist.

There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

I could be an accountant for the mob.

I could guess people's weight
at the fair.

Okay, this is getting silly.

Is it?

One-eighty.

Okay, that is enough!

Your lives are not wasted,

your careers are not at a dead end.

You just hit a rough patch.

Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,
you need to get up and get inspired.

- How?
- I don't know!

You know, when I'm feeling down,
I go for a run.

Which is exactly why I'm not
180 pounds, genius!

I know where we need to go.

Um, are we running there?
Because watching drunk Sheldon run

would be the highlight of my life.

<i>(RAJESH CHUCKLES)</i>

We're going to see Richard Feynman.

Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic physicist--

I know who he is. Leonard dressed as him
for Halloween last year.

I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.

Yeah, most people don't know

he's actually buried
right here in Altadena.

I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

Well, (CHUCKLES) here he is. (SNIFFLES)

Oh, wow, he's buried with his wife.

We get it, a lady loved you.
Quit bragging!

Feynman was so cool.

When I was a kid,
I'd put on some headphones

and crank up one of his lectures

and just jam out to knowledge.

This guy knew how to live.

Taught himself musical instruments,

studied Portuguese
just to give a speech in Brazil.

The only part of me
that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.

Okay.

He did so much,

and here we are stuck
and letting him down.

You know, Feynman used to say
he didn't do physics

for the glory or the awards,

but just for the fun of it.

He's right.

Physics is only dead
when we stop being excited about it.

Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

Um, I'm the one who remembered it.

Give me the bottle.
It might be a little corny,

but I say we pour one out

for all the science homies
who came before us.

- I love that.
- LEONARD: Do <i>it.</i>

(HOWARD AND RAJESH CHUCKLE)

Here comes some more!

(SHELDON RETCHING)

Ah, we got to see him run.

Hi. You wanted to see me?

Yes, I wanted to talk to you about
the email you sent me last night.

I sent you an email?

You bet you did.

"Hello, shalom and aloha
from the grave of Richard Feynman."

Oh, it's coming back to me.

"Please accept the following retraction,

"I know I said physics is dead,

"but it is the opposite of dead.

"If anything, it is undead,
like a zombie.

"Speaking of which, if Richard Feynman
came back as a zombie,

"I would totally let him bite me."

Any chance that's the end?

"I got bit by a squirrel once.

"I had to get rabies shots.

"I cried so much,
my mother said, 'Don't be a baby.'

"In conclusion, physics is great,

"squirrels suck and someday,

"I'm gonna put my mom
in a cheap nursing home.

"Yours truly, XOXO,
Doctor Leonard Hofstadter."

I can explain. I--.

"P.S.

"Can you come pick us up?

"The Uber driver won't open the door

"because Sheldon is covered
in blue vomit."

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Hmm, some news of our wedding.

I have sent you all
a save the date email.

Oh, exciting. You guys picked a date?

Better, I picked eighty dates.

And I need you to save them all
until we narrow it down.

I thought we agreed on June 15th.

That's the day after Flag Day.

Everybody will be partied out.

It's a date, just pick one.

It's not just a date,
it's a textbook optimization problem.

There is a perfect date,

just like there's a perfect
room temperature and a perfect dessert.

Hmm. There's no perfect dessert.

Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur
with chocolate frosting,

scoop of vanilla ice cream
on the side, not touching.

You'll see,
you'll have it at our wedding.

You wanna bet?

You give me enough time, I can do
the same thing with the wedding date.

It needs to be on the weekend,
not near any of your birthdays

or the weekend of Comic-Con.

Oh, you can get married at Comic-Con.

"No!
"No!

We just need a weekend date
that's completely boring and uneventful.

Too bad you didn't get
your ducks in a row

'cause tonight would've been perfect.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Good morning.

Good morning.

I know today is Apple Jack's clay,
but we're all out.

That's fine. I'll have anything.

- Really?
- Yeah.

You know, whatev.

"Whatev?" I like this side of you.

You know what I like?

Smooth jazz.

(SCATTING)

Hey, just a reminder,
I'm goin' out for drinks after work.

Great. Just a reminder, you're pregnant.

I'm not drinking,
just taking a new co-worker out.

(CHUCKLES) Just a reminder,
you're married.

Female co-worker.

She's new in town
and I wanna make her feel welcome.

And let her know
the office is full of liars

before everyone tells her I'm mean.

Is she single?

I'm not setting her up with Raj.

What about Stuart?

Are you listening?
I want her to think I'm not mean.

Okay. Well, it's just,
we have two single friends.

Howie, I just met this woman.

Why don't I wait a little
and get to know her.

Maybe I won't like her

and then I'd be happy
to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.

That's all I ask.

So you guys lived with Sheldon
for a long time.

- Long time.
- So very long.

By the way, congratulations again
on your engagement.

Yeah, you got a good one.

Thanks. So it's strange,

Sheldon was talking
in his sleep last night

and he seemed like
a totally different person.

He was relaxed and loose and calm.

Sheldon's a complicated man.

He said "whatev."

Get him a brain scan,
that might be a tumor.

Well, I think the wedding planning
is really stressful for him

and that can trigger sleep talking.

Maybe this is a part of Sheldon's
personality he's been repressing.

Yeah, I think we dream about things
we wish we could be in real life.

Really? What do you dream about?

Oh, uh...

Being the wife of Leonard, mostly that.

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

I choose to believe you.

Well, as much as we've
studied the brain,

there's still a lot we don't know
about dreams and their function.

You know, even psychologists
are divided on it.

Mm, it's true. Freud thought dreams
were about sex.

Adler thought they were about dominance.

Then again mine are just about
being married to this little guy.

Okay, now it's just edging into mockery.

Well, moving to a new city
was a little scary,

but the job seems great.
Everyone's really nice.

Oh, they are, super nice.

I mean, only one of them
took you out tonight,

but it's not a competition.

Thanks again.

You know, we could've gone somewhere
more pregnancy friendly.

Oh, it's okay. One of the great things
about being pregnant

is drinking cranberryjuice
out of a wine glass

-and watching people freak out.
-(RUCHI CHUCKLES)

Bernie!

Oh, damn.

Hey, what are the odds?

Yes, seren-frickin'-dipity.

- Hello, Rajesh.
- Stuart.

Hi, Ruchi.

Ruchi is my co-worker,

but that was probably
in your briefing packet.

(KEYS CLATTERING)

- Hi.
- Hello.

What's wrong?

(SIGHS) Well, I found
the perfect wedding date.

That's terrific!

No, it's not, it was May 19th, 1996.

We would've had a lovely wedding

and our honeymoon would have coincided

with the first appearance
of the Hale-Bopp comet.

Sheldon, you were 16.

And in Texas,
no one would have batted an eye.

Oh, wait, it's no good,

that's the day that Jon Pertwee,
the third Doctor Who died.

- And it's in the past.
- Hey, I said it's no good,

just let it go.

Sheldon, I appreciate you trying
to make this wedding perfect,

but it's making you miserable.

The wedding isn't making me miserable,

the calendar is.

Why can't there just be
one week each month

for famous people to die?

Well, they've already arranged
to die in threes.

What more do you want from them?

This is so frustrating.
Why can't I find the perfect date?

I found the perfect way
to say hi to cowboys. (CLICKS TONGUE)

(STUTTERS) I'm just saying,
maybe there's a part of you deep down

that just wants to
relax a little, you know,

kick back, say "whatev."

"Whatev?"

I'm sorry, are you really not gonna
finish that word?

- I'm just trying to make a point.
- Finish the word, Amy.

Fine, "er."

Er, er, er.

Thank you, only now you owe me
three more "whatevs."

Ah, you were born in Trivandrum.

Have you ever been
to the Kuthira Malika Palace?

No, I haven't.

Me either. What a small world!
(CHUCKLES)

I've also never been there.

I've never been lots of places.
Go on, quiz me.

I'm sorry, we're being rude
talking about India.

Oh, yeah, you know, if you
and Bernadette wanna talk about America,

that's cool with us.

Here, let me get you started.

(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
Hamburgers, am I right?

So what do you guys do?

Well, I'm an astrophysicist,

so if you ever go out at night
and look up at the stars,

it's kind of my office. (CHUCKLES)

He sells comic books to children.

Actually, I own my own store,

(STUTTERS) if you'd like
to check it out sometime,

I'm running a new promotion,

"Buy anything, get taken out
for a reasonably-priced dinner."

Yeah, yeah,
Stuart's struggling financially,

but he doesn't let that get him down.
He believes in himself,

even though the whole world
has made it clear he should not.

Thank you,

and you know, Raj, I think it's great

that you no longer live off your parents
like a spoiled child.

You live over someone's garage,
like a failed adult.

Yeah, well, you live with her.

Oh, it's not like that. He rents a room
from me and my husband,

who, by the way is no prize either.

Oh, I don't care.

You know me, I just go with the flow.

Beach, public pool,

they both sound awesome.

SHELDON: (ON SPEAKERS)
On second thought, beach,

<i>I'd like to befriend a seagull.</i>

That is crazy.

Yeah. Will you email that to me?

Have you played this for him?

No, I'm worried he'll say
I violated his privacy.

Listen, how happy he sounds.

<i>SHELDON". I'm up for anything.</i>

<i>As long as I'm with you.</i>

What're you listening to?

Nothing.

Oh, come on, I wanna hear.

SHELDON: We don't need GPS,

<i>let's just see where the road takes us.</i>

I see why you turned it off,

that guy sounds like an idiot.

Honey, that's you.

Don't be silly.
My voice is deep and sonorous,

like a Caucasian James Earl Jones.

"Luke, I'm your father." See.

It is you. I recorded you in your sleep.

<i>SHELDON: Oh, look, a hitchhiker,</i>

<i>I bet he has some interesting stories.</i>

- That's me?
- It's you.

So you spied on me in my sleep?

Sheldon, I'm sorry,

you've been doing this every night.

I couldn't help but wonder
if it meant something.

- Well, it doesn't.
- Are you sure?

I mean, the prefrontal cortex
regulates impulse control,

so its plausible that when we're asleep,

aspects of our personality
that we repress might come out.

Don't try to put science lipstick
on your New Age pig.

And for the record,
you make noises when you sleep

and I've never accused you
of repressing your inner chainsaw.

If you want me to
object at your wedding,

just give me one of these.

This picture of Galactus eating a planet
looks like my preggo wife

destroying a coffee cake.

Oh, yeah, I see it.

I'm just saying, you should bow out.

Why should I bow out?

Because we all know
how this is gonna end.

That's what my doctor said, too,
but I'm still here.

Okay, look, I think that
she and I have more in common.

Because you're Indian?

So just 'cause she's brown,
you get to date her.

Yes.

And the next time we meet a woman who's
pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.

(SIGHS)

Howard, Bernadette was there last night,

did she say anything when she got home?

Yeah, she said, "Why'd you tell
those idiots where I was? Thanks a lot."

Okay, how about we flip a coin?

Hang on, doesn't this girl
get a word in all of this

and isn't that word "no"?

Ruchi said she wanted to hang out
with both of us,

why don't we just do that?

Oh, fine. Let's hang out as friends
and see what happens.

Yeah, and if something grows out of it,
just worry about it then.

Also what my doctor said.

Hey, this isn't your laundry night.

(SIGHS) I know, laundry on a Wednesday.

Some madness my life has become.

Why is this sleep talking thing
bothering you anyway?

It's simple.

I don't like the idea that my mind

might be keeping
an entire personality from me.

Doctor Jekyll's other personality
was Mr. Hyde.

Mr. Hyde didn't have
a postgraduate degree.

Is it possible that you're stressed

because you're scared
about getting married?

I mean, it is a big change
and you're not good with little changes.

That's nonsense.

You name one little change
I was upset with.

Uh, when they changed
the green Skittle from lime to apple.

That is not the rainbow
I grew up tasting.

(SIGHS)

All right, fine. Let's start over.

Is it possible

that the sleep talking is a part
of your brain that's telling you

everything's gonna be okay
and you just need to relax a little?

So, you're proposing that

the self is an illusion.

And that we actually have
multiple centers of consciousness

that are communicating with one another?

In layman's terms, yeah.

Huh! Interesting.

So you don't believe
there is a Cartesian self

that underlies the flux of experience.

Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.

Okay.

Well assuming you're right,

what would you suggest I do?

Well, I would start
with something small.

See if it makes your life any better.

Uh, you could learn to meditate,
take a yoga class.

You know, I have always
been intrigued by flip-flops,

the official footwear
of the laid back fellow.

Okay. Sure.

Of course if my feet
are gonna be exposed

I'll need to update my tetanus booster.

Oh, yeah. Makes sense.

And while I'm there, I might as well
get a flu shot and a mole check.

Sure. (SIGHS)

You know, I've never had a mole check.

Oh.

Well, it's been nice knowing you.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it.
He seemed fun.

Oh, yeah. He is. I love him dearly.

Not to say that I don't worry about him.

What's to worry about?

You know what?
I'm talking out of school.

Speaking of which,
he's allowed to live near them now.

Hey, guys!

- Oh, great, Stuart, you're here.
- Yes, Stuart.

Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

Hmm. I believe that.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Sorry guys, it's work.
I've got to take it.

- I'm so glad you made it, Stuart.
- Oh, yeah, so glad.

I can't believe you went behind my back.

Which clearly means I want this more.

You wanna play a game
of "who's more desperate" with me,

'cause you're in
the big leagues now, Bucko.

Look, Ruchi and I
are really hitting it off.

Please let me just have this one.

I'm not going anywhere.
I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.

Sorry. So what's going on?

Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story
about the fungus he can't get rid of.

Raj didn't tell me about tonight,
so he could be alone with you.

Really? That's a little weird.

Just a little?
Because I can work with that.

Look, guys, I'm not interested
in dating anyone right now.

I'm just looking to make some friends.

Yeah, I totally understand.

But if you were gonna date someone,
would it be me or Stuart?

I think I'm gonna go.

(STUTTERING)

Ruchi, I'm sorry.

If you still wanna
hang out as friends, I'd like that.

Thanks, Stuart. I'd like that, too.

And the fungus is under the toenail.

- Hello.
- Hey.

So, um...

I, uh...

I got flip-flops.

Good for you.

Oh, my God! What happened?

After I got the flip-flops, I realized

that the tops of my feet
were exposed.

So, I put on some sunscreen,

which caused my feet to become slippery.

And predictably, one of them fell off
and went down a sewer grate.

Now normally, I would have walked away,

but this is a new, laid back me.

So, instead of getting upset
I just reached down to grab it.

That's when I touched something furry.

Which I'm telling myself,
was a damp toupee.

When the toupee licked my hand,

I screamed and hopped down the street
on my remaining flip-flop.

- Can I just ask--
- This is a long story,

why don't we please
save your questions till the end?

So, I finally came upon a bus bench

where I sat and removed one of my shirts

and, fashioned it
into a makeshift shoe.

Not a waterproof shoe.

That is relevant
to the next part of my story,

the ankle-deep puddle
of warm apple juice.

Apple juice?

Maybe, maybe not.

I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.

What happened to your other flip-flop?

(STUTTERS) Oh, that involves
what I'm telling myself

was a melted candy bar.

(SIGHS)

(STUTTERS) I'm sorry.

Is there anything I can do to help?

Yes.

I want you to be in charge
of our wedding.

Just you tell me where and when,

and I will show up with a boutonniere,
and close-toed shoes,

and, a Star Trek uniform
underneath my tuxedo.

That last part is non-negotiable.

Are you sure that's what you want?

<i>As sure as
I'm about to go bathe 'm Pureâ.</i>

- I love you.
- I love you, too.

You know, ever since I was a young girl,

I've dreamed of a June wedding,

maybe on a cliff

overlooking the ocean at sunset.

Sure.

Sounds wonderful.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go clean up.

Outdoor wedding.

SHELDON: I know what I'll be using
that cliff for.

I call this meeting
of the Council of Sheldons to order.

Let's take roll.

Science Sheldon.

Present.

Texas Sheldon.

Howdy.

Fanboy Sheldon.

Greetings.

Germophobe Sheldon.

Say it, don't spray it.

Where is Jock Sheldon?

Not the time, Humorous Sheldon.

Okay. New business.

Do we grant Laid-back Sheldon

a seat on the council?

Hey, whatever you guys want.

I'm just chilling like Bob Dylan.

- Negative.
- Heck, no.

I don't feel well.

(HONKS)

Can we kick him out, too?

English - SDH

It feels like it wasn't that long ago

we were here doing this for Halley.

'Cause it wasn't.

Which reminds me, before we leave,
let's get you a vasectomy.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

Well, that's sweet,
but today's all about you.

So, you two ready to find out
the sex of this baby?

- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

Is Halley hoping for a little brother
or a little sister?

Well, she's nine months old.

So unless it jingles or is in my bra,
she doesn't care.

And how about you two?

You know, (SIGHS) for the first one,
we really wanted a girl,

but this time around
we don't have a preference.

Yeah. Boy, girl,
as long as it's healthy.

Well, it's a boy.

- Huh.
- Oh.

Oh, come on,
you can't really be disappointed.

Hey, I barely know
how to be a man myself.

Now I have to teach someone?

As the saying goes,
those who can't do, teach.

Don't you want
a little version of Howard?

I already have
a little version of Howard.

(SIGHS)

Now, I'm having a son?

I'll have to teach him
how to play sports

and watch sports and...

And, and, and, and... (STUTTERS)

He just ran out of man things.
He's in trouble.

It's okay. We're all here to help.

Yes, and this baby will have
plenty of manly role models.

Now, I'm certain that whatever
Bernadette can't teach him, Penny can.

Uh, she can pee into a bottle.

Mm-hmm. Anything with a neck
wider than a nickel.

Howie, there's a lot of amazing things
you can teach a son.

Yeah, you do always know
how to pick just the right antacid.

I don't know if I can teach that.
It's just something I was born with.

Come on. You can build things.
You were an astronaut.

That's true. You know, as a kid
I used to make model rockets.

That'd be pretty cool to do with a son.

Model rockets!
Finally! Something interesting.

What is your preferred mode of recovery?

Sheldon, we're helping our friends.

Yeah, and we got to model rockets.

That was a tedious road,
but well worth the effort.

So, have you thought of any names?

Amy! We finally got to model rockets!

Why are you turning back?

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

- Hey, where you going?
- Back to the dry cleaner.

Look at this. They didn't get the stain
out of my Starfleet uniform.

Well, if you didn't make me wear
the green body paint in bed,

you wouldn't have to
get it dry cleaned so much.

Nah, it's worth it.

(SKYPE RINGTONE)

Hey, wait. It's your mom.

Uh-oh, too bad she just missed me.

Hey, Beverly.

<i>Oh, hello, Penny.</i>

Uh, Leonard just left. He's going to be
<i>so</i> upset he missed your call.

<i>Why?</i>

Because he--

Yeah, I don't know. How are you?

<i>Did you mean personally
or professionally?</i>

Um, personally.
Like, what'd you do last night?

<i>I had Cuban food at the home of a man</i>

<i>with whom I shared
unsatisfying intercourse.</i>

Wow. Okay.

<i>And to anticipate your next questions,</i>

<i>roasted pork and sideways missionary.</i>

Sure, sure. 'Cause you were full.

I haven't looked
at all this stuff in years.

Had it. Had it.

Burned down my garage with it.

I had three model rockets as a kid.

And that was the largest
space program in India.

You have a replica Saturn V?

Yeah. My dad bought it
before he, you know,

abandoned our family.

Lucky duck.

Could never bring myself
to open it without him. (CHUCKLES)

It's silly.

No, it's not silly. I always wanted
my dad to build rockets with me

but he wasn't interested.

Ah, yes. Disappointing fathers.

Tell me about it.

I remember for my 16th birthday,
my clad bought me a Mercedes,

like, a little one, like,
a starter Mercedes.

He had barely handed me the keys
before he had to rush back to work.

I didn't see him again till, like,

pretty late that night.

Anyway,

as angry as I was with him leaving,

building this stuff is probably
what led me to become an engineer.

I suppose, in his own way,

my dad also encouraged me
to pursue science.

I mean, he is the one that taught me
that flatulence is combustible.

And also, polyester gym shorts
don't burn.

They melt.

Yeah, I guess
I'm an astrophysicist because

as a kid I said
I like to look at the stars

<i>so</i> my dad sent me to Hawaii
to visit the Keck telescope.

(RAJESH SCOFFS)

Screw you, my pain is real.

You know what? Forget the past.

What do you say
you and me build this rocket?

That sounds like it could be
a real bonding experience for us.

Right?

Oh, I see. You think that's a positive.

So you didn't want to hang out
with Sheldon and Howard?

No, they were bonding over
their sad childhoods

and my stupid parents
were always there for me.

What's all this?

I'm just boxing up all the clothes
Halley's outgrown.

Guess we won't need 'em anymore.

Whoa, wha-- slow it down. I'm sure
there's some you could reuse for a boy.

"Daddy's little girl"?

Okay, well, what if we, uh,
change it to say,

"Daddy's little girl magnet"?

Boom! Boy shirt.

What about this?

Uh, okay. Pull off the skirt,

slap a lightning bolt on the front
and you got Baby Flash.

Ooh, stick a long sleeve under it.
Boom! Baby Sheldon. (CHUCKLES)

Wow, you're really good at this.

Oh, please. This isn't my first time
turning girl clothes into boy clothes.

Why? You got your sister's
hand-me-downs?

Yeah. That.

Oh, I should've brought peanuts.

You can't eat peanuts, you're allergic.

If you die,
who's going to drive me home?

No, I'm not gonna eat them,
it's a thing they do at JPL.

When the Ranger Mission
finally had a successful launch,

there were peanuts in the room.
Ever since then,

they have them at every launch.

That sounds like a silly superstition.

It's more of a tradition.
(SIGHS)

Oh! I do love a tradition.

Could you pull over
at the next peanut store?

I don't think that's a real thing.

Oh, don't be pedantic,
any nut store will do.

Uh, I don't think we can get
peanuts out here.

Well, then this whole day's ruined.

Now that I think about it,
maybe it is more of a superstition.

Phew, that was close.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, hey, Beverly,
you called my phone, not Leonard's.

Actually, I was hoping
to speak with you.

Is this a good time?

Uh, that depends.
What time is it where you are?

Just after 5:00.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah, that counts. What's up?

Well, I enjoyed our conversation
the other day

and I was hoping to continue it.

Really?

<i>BEVERLEY:
Yes. You may find this surprising,</i>

but I don't have a lot of
what you would call "girlfriends."

(SARCASTICALLY) What?

Of course,
there are my female colleagues,

but they're all Freudians,

so the only boy
that I can dish about is my father.

(LAUGHS)

Well, you know, I'm here for you.
What do you wanna talk about?

Well, last time we focused on my life.

If we're going to be real girlfriends,
we should talk about you as well.

Well, you know,
if we're going to be real girlfriends,

we should get a third girl
we can trash behind her back.

Oh, so we'd be catty.

I like it.

What about Sheldon's fiancÃ©e?
She seems a bit dour.

Ooh, "Dour." Meow.

All right, here we go.

L-minus ten, nine--

Wait, what are you doing? It's T-minus.

I was an astronaut, we used L-minus.

Yeah, but this is a Saturn V

and when they launched those,
they said T-minus.

It's my rocket, we're doing it my way.

Fine.

I'm not saying I know why your dad left

but I think I'm getting an idea.

L-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six--

'Cause you're kind of bossy.

(SIGHS)

Five, four, three, two, one.

Yeah, I remember them going up higher.

Well, that's perfect.

I mean, the one thing
I thought I could (SIGHS)

do with my son,
I can't even do that right.

If you wanna see it again,
I got it on video.

Looks pretty cool in slow motion.

(SIGHS)

Thank you for your support.

- You're welcome.
- I was being sarcastic.

How dare you.

Sheldon, what am I gonna do?

What do I know
about raising a boy?

What do you know about raising a girl?

Oh, my God, you're right.

Well, I don't know
if that was sarcasm or not, so,

either you're welcome, or hey!

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Leonard, did you really
just text me from the couch

to put extra mustard on your sandwich?

I was worried
you might not check your e-mail.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

I swear to God I will throw this out.

That one was not me.

Oh, wait, it's just your mom.

My mother's texting you?

Yeah, we've been talking a lot lately.

Why?

Is she sick of talking
to the magic mirror on the wall?

No, I think she's lonely.
She's been reaching out.

Okay, just be careful.

You think you're getting close to her,
the next thing you know,

you're featured in a book called

<i>He's Doing It On Purpose:
Raising a Teenage Bedwetter.</i>

No, it's not like that.

You know, she's been opening up
about her life

and she's actually been
really supportive about mine.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I've been telling her about my job
and she said she was proud of me.

That's great.

Never told me she was proud of me.

Even when I stayed dry
for a whole month.

Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?

Well, the-- Let's be clear,
(STUTTERS) I married you to hurt her.

You're kinda ruining it.

Reason number 13 to feel good.

(STUTTERS) As a launch, it was bad,

but as an explosion, it was glorious.

Reason 14,

you still have all your fingers

and boys prefer a dad with fingers.

Thanks for trying, but you're not gonna
be able to cheer me up.

Well, how about this, then?

You quit your whining before I give you
something to cry about, young man.

(SCOFFS)

What?

Those are comforting words
my father would often say.

Did it help?

I turned out great. You tell me.

Let's get going.

Are you gonna be this mopey
all the way home?

I don't know. Maybe.

There any chance you'd be cheered up
by an amazing trigonometry riddle?

(SIGHS)

Well, if you can't answer that,

there's no way
you're going to get this riddle.

Oh, hey. Hey, what do you think?

Just because it's a boy,

I don't think you need to put a picture
of genitals on his shirt.

What? That's a baseball bat
with two little baseballs.

Okay, yeah, now I see it.

So, you know,

I understand why Howard
is nervous about having a son,

but are you really upset about it?

No, I'm fine.

It's just, I grew up
with a bunch of brothers, so,

I thought it'd be nice
for Halley to have a sister.

Is that wrong?

Of course, it's wrong.

You don't know what this little boy
is gonna be like.

Maybe he'll be rough and tumble

or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive

or maybe he'll be
all those things, like me.

You're rough and tumble?

You bet I am, bitch.

But I'm also sensitive
and regret saying that.

- Hey.
- Hello.

You got a sec?

Sure, what's up?

Penny's been talking to my mother
like they're best friends

and it's kind of freaking me out.

Okay.

I'm pretty sure
they're not best friends.

'Cause you can only have
one best friend,

and Penny has that, and (TSKS) it's me.

Oh, really? ls she facetiming
with you right now?

Because she's facetiming with my mom

and believe me, that is not a face
you want to spend time with.

Hmm. Well, I have been
pretty busy lately.

Maybe I've been
neglecting our friendship.

Penny knows I have a complicated
relationship with my mother.

It's like she doesn't even care.

And with everything going on at the lab
and planning the wedding,

I just, I have so little free time.

Penny doesn't know how manipulative
my mother can be.

Did you know there's such a thing as
reverse, reverse, reverse psychology?

Because there is.

I mean, she must feel so abandoned.

She's used to me
being there all the time,

but now I have my own life
and she's just gonna have to accept it.

And why is my mom proud of Penny
and not me?

I mean, the real question is,

why is Penny so afraid of me
growing as a person?

I'm good at stuff too.

I deserve my own life!

- Okay, well, thanks.
- Yeah, good talk.

You know, studies have shown

that people distracted
by emotional issues

are poor drivers.

What about people distracted
by irritating passengers?

That would be hard to test

because irritating is
a subjective quality.

Strongly disagree.

(SIGHS)

Can I drive?

No, (CHUCKLES) you can't drive,
you don't even have a license.

Actually, I do.

Really? Since when?

Three years ago.

I went on a bit of a license kick.

I'm also a commercial fisherman.

Then why don't you ever drive yourself?

Honestly, I barely passed my test.

And the one time I drove on my own,

I made a U-turn, got dizzy,
threw up and walked home.

You really want to drive?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

This seems like the perfect time.

The roads are straight,
there's no one around

and you don't seem to care
if you live or die.

Live, Sheldon, I want to live.

That makes things a little trickier,
but I'll do my best.

(SKYPE LINE RINGING)

<i>Hi, Pen-- Oh, hello, Leonard.</i>

Hello, Mother. How are you?

<i>Fine, and you?</i>

<i>-l'm great.
- Well, it's been lovely catching up.</i>

No, no, no. Wait, (STUTTERS)
hang on, we need to talk.

<i>Oh, brother.</i>

I wanna know,

why aren't you proud of me?

<i>Well, isn't the real question,
why aren't you proud of yourself?</i>

No. That is a question

and I ask it a lot.

But let's stick with the one
I asked you.

<i>Well, why do you think
I'm not proud of you?</i>

Because you never say it.

But two days into chatting with Penny

and you can't stop telling her
how great she is.

<i>She is great.</i>

<i>Honestly,
of all of my children's spouses,</i>

<i>she's the one
that I'm most impressed by.</i>

- Seriously?
- Yes.

<i>She's confident, she's thoughtful
and she never complained about you once.</i>

<i>I know what kind of strength that takes.</i>

So, Penny's your favorite?

<i>I suppose she is.</i>

<i>You married well, Leonard,
and for that I am proud of you.</i>

I don't-- I don't--
I don't know what to say.

<i>I'm also proud of
how hard you're trying not to cry.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Would you like to hang up now?</i>

Yeah, here it comes.

Your hands are at ten and two, good.

Steady on the gas.

Okay.

Now you're gonna wanna
slowly switch lanes.

Why?

Because there are only two
and you're not in either of them.

Attaboy. Well done.

Thank you.

Last time I drove,
I was terrified, but this is fun.

You're doing great.

You're a good teacher.

<i>(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</i>

Your son is going to be lucky
to have you as a father.

Thanks.

Do you think
I could try going a little faster?

(SIGHS SOFTLY)

Go for it, champ.

<i>Ow.</i>

Sorry. Just ease on the gas and--

Oh! Too much, too much!

Why was I scared of this?
This is exhilarating.

No, it's not! Slow down!

Don't tell me what to do,
you're not my father.

Do you know how fast you were going?

A hundred and twelve.

Let me see your license.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

- Okay, here's the plan.
- No.

Fine.

There you go.

You know what, you can just keep it.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Thanks for letting me put
Halley in your room.

Oh, no problem.

And Penny, she kinda threw up
on your stuffed bear.

Oh, that's okay.

Hey, (STUTTERS)
that's an Ewok and it's mine.

Yeah, which is why it's okay.

See, he gets Ewoks in his bed.

You've got Chewbacca, that's enough.

I used to have the stuffed raccoon
from Guardians <i>of</i> the <i>Galaxy</i>

but Cinnamon licked it raw.

There's a time and place
for your randy dog stories

and it's never and nowhere.

Yeah, no more stories about sex,
so Amy, that brings us to you.

Well, at work we've been doing

some interesting research
with neuroprosthetics.

Neat. I've been re-watching <i>The O.C.,</i>

so we're all leading productive lives.

We've been working
on a computer interface

that can use brain wave patterns
to control robotic limbs,

but we're having a little trouble
localizing the signal from the EEG cap.

Oh, well, have you thought about adding
a phased array of sensors

for better localization?

Actually, that never occurred to me.

It never occurred to me
I would miss the Ewok conversation.

Good, 'cause ljust bought
another one on Amazon.

You know, I could use
an engineer on this project.

Well, now, this works out great.
Howard's an engineer.

-(HOWARD CHUCKLES)
-l'm sure he knows someone qualified.

She's talking about me, Sheldon.

I'm perfectly qualified.

Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer.

It says so right on his coffee mug.

- Aw, you got him a mug?
- I did.

But it's not a competition.

Yeah, I lost that battle years ago.

So, Howard, are you interested?

Are you kidding? If I could control
robot arms with my brain

I'd be able to do so many things.

Really? Because you've been controlling
human arms with your brain for years

and not much has come of it.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Hey, what you reading?

A parenting book.

Oh, my God. (STUTTERS) Are we...

What? No.

You think this is how I would tell you?

Well, (STAMMERS) you're sitting there
with a book.

It felt like anything was possible.

I don't know.

Bernadette left it here.

Oh, yeah? Anything interesting?

Well, I just saw a picture
of a baby's head crowning,

so I hope you enjoyed sex,
because we're done with that.

Hello.

- Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
- Hi.

Remember how disappointed you were
when Amy started driving me to work?

Sure the--

Sometimes people smile
a big smile of disappointment.

Yeah, well, good news,

Amy had to go in early
to show Howard around her lab,

so you get to drive me.

Aw, his smile of disappointment
has turned into a frown of joy.

It's fine.
I've been driving him for years,

what's one more day?

Oh, and I got
a new car game we can play.

It's called, "What siren am I?"

Kill me.

Amy, your lab is amazing.

A C-arm fluoroscope.

A cranial ultrasound.

(GASPS)

And look at that coffee maker.

I know. On our expense report,
I listed it as

"Eduardo," my Colombian lab assistant.

-(TSKS) So, this is it?
- Yes.

We're using it to map brainwave patterns

and then converting them
into electrical impulses

that can be used to control anything
from wheelchairs to robots.

Based on that ring on your finger,

I'd say you're pretty good
at controlling robots. (CHUCKLES)

Careful, that's my fiancÃ©
you're talking about

and I can program him to hurt you.

(IMITATES SIREN SOUNDS)

I don't know, (STUTTERS) French police?

Oh, so close. Belgian ambulance.

All right. You ready for your next one?

And just a warning,
this one's a little annoying.

(IMITATES SIREN SOUNDS)

All right, all right. Let's take
a little break. I'm getting a headache.

Oh.

Right in the middle of our fun game.

Yeah, weird.

So, Howard and Amy working together,
that's interesting, huh?

Eh, it's all right, I suppose.

When usually when Amy complains

about her co-workers
I just tune her out,

but now I'll be able to join in
and pound away.

You're not jealous of Howard, are you?

You-- Of course not.

The only engineer I'm jealous of

is the one who blows the train whistle.

Ooh, that just gave me an idea
for a new game,

"What whistle am I?"

Train.

For your information,
it was going to be tea kettle,

but the tea kettle was on a train,
so I'll give it to you.

If we add phase detection
to your EEG sensors,

I'll have to rewrite most of the code.

Can you do that?

These hands were made
to do three things.

Close-up magic, writing code
and the dirty shadow puppet show

that got me kicked out of Hebrew school.

Hello.

Hi. What a nice surprise.

Well, ljust came by to see
how you two were getting along.

(CHUCKLES)
Well, everything's going really great.

Aw, that's nice to hear.

I was hoping
you two would enjoy working together.

(STUTTERS) What's with the blinking?

It's Morse code.

So we can talk about...

Without hurting... Feelings.

Uh, Sheldon, I don't know Morse code.

I do. And if you have something to say,
you can say it to my face.

Oh.

All right.

I'm a little rusty,
could you say that again?

(EXHALES)

She's going to be home at "8:00-ish"?

(STAMMERS) What is that? 8:01, 8:02?

And what kind of scientist uses "ish"?

I'll give it a go.
My ride home with you was hellish.

Sheldon, honey, if you wanna join us
for dinner you're more than welcome.

Oh, thank you. I don't think
I'd be very good company tonight.

Hmm, well, then out you go.

Okay, what is going on?

Well, ever since
Amy started working with Howard

she hasn't been home.

Didn't that just start this morning?

And has she been home?

You know, that would frustrate me.

Does it frustrate you?

It does.

I get that.

You know, it's okay to feel frustrated
when things aren't going your way.

(SIGHS) I suppose.

Ah, maybe it's not that big a deal.

No, no, no, your feelings are valid.

Now, why don't you go wash up

and we'll call you when dinner's ready.

Okay.

(DOOR CLOSES)

What did you do? Are you a witch?

Well, I've been reading
Bernadette's parenting book.

It's like the answer key
to the Sheldon test.

That's amazing.

I know. But, you know,
it's only birth to five.

What do we do when he turns six?

Take him to the zoo and leave him there.

Hey, Bernadette.

Oh, hey, Raj. Howard's not here.

I know. He's been at the lab every night
this week with his work wife.

That's weird, I thought his work wife
was standing in my kitchen.

Don't be snippy, I came to see
how you were doing.

Like, uh, do you need
help with anything?

Thank you.

There are a few things around the house

that I've been waiting for Howard
to get to. The smoke alarms need--

No, I meant emotionally.

How are you feeling?

Like you're not really here to help me.

Wow, still snippy.

Everything's fine.

Howard's really excited about his work,

he's been in a great mood.
I'm really proud of him.

And I can fit into the pants
I wore in high school.

Come on,
we don't need to lie to each other.

You're right. I have a teething baby,

I'm pregnant, I have a proposal
due tomorrow,

I don't have time to hear about
how much you're missing my husband.

Well, I think I know why
he's been working so late.

- Hi.
- Welcome home.

- How was work?
-(CHUCKLES) Great.

- Howard had an idea for--
- That's enough about work.

You just got here. You need to sit down
and let me pamper you.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Well, that sounds nice.

I got you a little something
to help you relax.

Sheldon, that is the sweetest--

Wha-- What is this?

The notes from our
quantum cognition project.

I thought we could spend the evening
grinding away on it.

(SIGHS) ljust got home. I'm tired.

Of Howard. I know.

So how about you and me
make some beautiful science together?

Sheldon, I want
to work on this with you,

just not tonight.

What if we get up early
and do it in the morning?

I promise I'll be way more into it.

You know what?

There was a time
that you would have been happy

to stay up and collaborate
all night with me

and then wake up in the morning
and do it some more.

(SIGHS) Fine, but can we make it quick?

No. If you're just going to make me
do all the work, then go to bed.

But don't be surprised if you walk
out here and catch me doing it myself.

Ugh.

Sheldon's texting me
to drive him to Bernadette's.

What are you gonna say?

Well, they did just introduce
the middle finger emoji.

If it's not for this,
I don't know what it's for.

No, no, no. He'll just think that means,
"Be there in a minute."

But-- maybe there's something
in the book that will help.

Worth a shot.

Okay, let's see, let's see.

"Biting other children?"

Sometimes, but problem for another day.

Okay, wait, wait, here we go.

"Let him have ownership of his choices.

"Allow him to choose from options
that are acceptable to you."

All right. I'll give it a try.

I can drive you in two hours, or

you can take an Uber.

Good. See, now he feels like
he has a choice.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

He's gonna take an Uber.

It worked.

Unless he bites the driver, yeah.

And now they're working on a Saturday.

Can you believe them?

I mean, is this how
you envisioned your weekend?

No, it is not.

This whole thing is maddening.

I'm really busy.

I don't have time
to listen to you complain.

Hey, you're complaining too.

"Sheldon, why are you here?"

"Sheldon, the applesauce
is for the baby."

What do you want?

ljust wish I could make
Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling.

Well, maybe you could do something
he likes and make him jealous.

- Like what?
- Have you ever read Tom Sawyer?

- No.
- Chores. He likes chores.

Ooh, what kind of chores?

Well, you could change the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

That would drive him crazy.

That's great.

Oh, he'll be so mad
smoke will be coming out of his ears

and then the smoke detectors
will detect it.

Wait a minute, hold on.
Why'd you ask me about <i>Tom</i> Sawyer?

I'm just interested in you.

Wha-- You are sweeter
than your applesauce.

Okay, I'm going to extend the wait time

and have it poll the A to D converter

at the top of the loop
instead of the bottom.

Ah, that's impressive.

You think that's impressive,
take apart that brain model.

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, three of clubs,
that was my card.

How did you...

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I used make it appear in my pants,

but HR said I had to stop doing that.

So, how much longer till we can test it?

It needs to compile,
so it's gonna be a few minutes. (SIGHS)

Sounds like we've
earned ourselves a break.

Wanna hear some Neil Sedaka?

You know,
that's your greatest magic trick

'cause you just read my mind.

(BOTH LAUGH)

(NEIL SEDAKA'S "CALENDAR GIRL" PLAYING)

(BOTH SINGING)

Well, well, well.

- Hi.
- Hey.

You say you're busy as bees,
yet here you are, dancing.

Although, I suppose bees do dance,

but their dance lets other bees know
where the pollen is,

and yours does not. So my logic,
despite that slight detour, does track.

We're just waiting
for my code to compile.

What are you doing here?

I stopped by to see if you wanted
to go to the movies with me.

Oh, (STUTTERS) I'd love to,

but we're just about to test
the interface. It could take a while.

Okay, buddy, this is not my place,

but Bernadette's been feeling
a little abandoned

with all the hours
you've been putting in.

You just asked him to go to the movies.

Yeah, but our weird relationship
was grandfathered into their marriage,

and yours was not.

Okay, I put new batteries
in the smoke detectors.

Did you do the laundry?

Hmm, I sure did.
Ooh, he's gonna be steamed,

just like his dress shirts.

At least he can still clean the oven,
so that's something.

Oh, that's what he thinks.
Where's your steel wool?

Right here.

We make quite the team.

Sure do.

Guys, you won't believe this.

I stopped by the university
to check in on Howard and Amy

and they were having fun.

Well, don't worry.

He won't be having any fun
when he gets home.

I did all his favorite chores.

What are you talking about?
Howard hates doing chores.

Yeah, then why would
Bernadette tell me that--

(GASPS) Bernadette.

Did you play on my well-established
gullibility to clean your house?

Sure did.

Well, I would storm out of here,

but I already have
the gloves and the steel wool

and I really do love
cleaning an oven. Move.

She made me do all her chores

and it wasn't even her idea.

She stole it from <i>Tom</i> Sawyer.

You know what? This is crazy.

Howard and Amy are working together,
get over it.

Leonard, what are you doing?

"Knowing when to say when."
This is not a big deal.

It is a big deal.

Howard's getting Amy used to
laughing and listening to music.

What if she expects
that madness at home?

You know, that is a good point.

I'm really proud of the way you're
able to talk express your feelings.

Thank you. I'm just so angry.

You know, everyone gets angry.

Even mommies and daddies.

You can't think this is the right time
to validate his behavior.

Okay, what about
"presenting a united front"?

What about you coddling him,
and he's never gonna learn?

Look.

You sound frustrated,

and I'm really proud of the way
you're able to state your opinion.

Thank you. Wait, no, no!

Don't use that book on me!

Wait, what book?

(SIGHS) Penny's been using one of
Bernadette's parenting books on you.

What? So has he.

What makes you think
you can treat me like a child?

Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.

That's because the adult shampoo
burns my man eyes.

Hey, what are you working on?

Oh, my God. You're still here?

Of course I'm here.
I know what you're going through.

Really? You have a needy
Indian man in your house?

I did, but then he came over here.

So is this how it's gonna be
if we have kids,

you're just gonna
throw me under the bus?

Well, if you spoil them
the way you do Sheldon, then yeah.

Uh, my way was working, okay.

I think you're just upset because
there are some things

I'm better than you at.

Well, you can't end a sentence
with a preposition,

so clearly not grammar.

If you're so smart,
was that a smart thing to say?

That depends. Before I said it,
was sex tonight still on the table?

- No.
- Then it's fine.

You know, once we get this operational,

we could probably figure out
how to make it wireless.

That'd be amazing.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, it's Sheldon.

Oh, he's upset with Leonard and Penny.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

And Bernadette.

And Mark Twain.

Yeah, Bernadette texted earlier.
Raj is really getting on her nerves.

I guess we have been working late a lot.

(EXHALES)

Should we call it a night and go home?

Or we could brew a pot of coffee
and power through.

I don't know, it's getting kinda late.

Hey, where's my watch?

Why don't you ask your skeleton?

(AMY GASPS)

Oh, my God, how is that even possible?

This is great,
the two of us hanging out.

Why didn't we think of this earlier?

Agreed. I don't need Amy
to watch a movie,

I can not hold your hand just as easily.

(CHUCKLES)

In the book this is based on,

that man's the killer.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Howie, slow down.

I can't. I'm not allowed to eat
for 12 hours before my surgery,

and I've only got two more minutes.

What surgery are you having?

I'm stress eating.

My best friend's getting
a vasectomy tomorrow.

And you're sad you won't be able
to bear his child?

Oh, my goodness!

If it's "vasectomy gone wrong" videos,
he's seen them all.

Including the one of the guy

who's sitting on what appears
to be a cantaloupe but is not.

And I'm done.

They're going to start making
Professor Proton's science show again.

I thought he passed away.

He did. He was cremated
and his remains were put

in a baking soda volcano.

(PENNY CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Don't make jokes.
He meant a lot to Sheldon.

Mm, me too. I grew up watching his show.

He's one of the reasons
I became a scientist.

Oh, I thought you did it
just to get girls.

Joke's on you. It worked.

Have they found anyone to replace him?

No, not yet. And it won't be easy.

Arthur Jeffries was
an accomplished scientist.

Hmm, you know who'd make
a great Professor Proton?

Meryl Streep.

She's not a scientist.

Uh, then explain to me why she has
chemistry with literally everyone.

It would be nice if they cast a woman.

<i>Oh, (STUTTERS) you've already got
Dr. Who</i> and <i>the Ghostbusters.</i>

Leave us something.

Who do you think it should be?

Um, it should be a scientist
I respect, you know.

Someone with a pleasing voice
and symmetrical facial features.

Is he talking about himself?

If he's talking,
he's talking about himself.

ljust know how much Professor Proton
touched me as a child,

and I feel that I owe it to him

to try and touch
as many children as possible.

You should put that
on your audition tape.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

You doing okay?

No, I'm very nervous.

(MAN GROANING)

Where are you going?

- Gift shop.
- There is no gift shop. Sit down.

This was your idea.

(GRUNTS) So was having sex.
And look where that got us.

This isn't a big deal. Stop whining.

When you were in labor
and I said that, you kicked me.

Howard Wolowitz.

<i>(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</i>

- Want me to go with you?
- No.

- I'll be fine.
- Yeah, we got this.

Sit down.

(SIGHS) Wish me luck.

Other way, buster.

Okay, you ready?

Yeah, almost. I'm working on
my facial expressions.

See, I've got "interested."

Hmm.

I've got "very interested." Hmm.

And, "enraged."

Why would you be enraged?

Hmm, better to have it and not need it
than to need it and not have it.

Okay.

And rolling.

Hello, I am theoretical physicist
Doctor Sheldon Cooper,

auditioning for the role of
Professor Proton.

Now, excuse me
while I get into character.

Hello, I'm Professor Proton.

And today, boys and girls,
we're going to have fun with science.

Did you know you could calculate
the mass of an electron

using household items?

It's true. All you'll need is a pencil,

some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol

and a spool of 50-micron-thick
cobalt-60 wire.

And remember,
don't put it in your mouth.

Or, instead of becoming a scientist,
you'll become wildly radioactive.

Hang on. I have a question.

Do you have any experiments
that aren't life-threatening?

Come on! That was a perfect take,
and you ruined it.

Oh, look, hey! I did need "enraged."

(EXHALES)

Ow, ow, ow.

Really hurts, huh?

No, he's just saying,
"Ow can these prices be so low?"

It's gonna be okay. A day or two
of rest, and you'll be fine.

You know nothing about Jewish people.

(BABY CRYING ON BABY MONITOR)

(HOWARD GROANING)

Let me go check on her.

(HOWARD BREATHING HEAVILY)

Okay, uh, this is a bit awkward.

It says here that I need to
check the area for redness and swelling.

You know what?
It hurts so much, go ahead.

<i>So you see, boys and girls,</i>

<i>H, or "helicity,"</i>

<i>is the natural variable
to use relativistically,</i>

<i>and is defined as âS dot P,"</i>

<i>divided by the magnitude of P.</i>

<i>So the next time someone
on the playground tells you,</i>

<i>you can only use integral values</i>

<i>for the matrix that determines
the spin of the antiproton,</i>

<i>You stop being friends with that kid,
'cause he's going nowhere.</i>

<i>Until next week,
this is Professor Proton saying,</i>

<i>"Zero one zero zero zero zero one zero</i>

<i>"zero One One One One zero zero One</i>

<i>"zero One One zero zero One zero one.</i>

<i>"That's 'bye"'in ASCII binary,</i>

<i>or 'good-binary.â</i>

(LAUGHS)

(CHUCKLES)

So,

what do you think?

Well, I already told him
that I loved it,

but if you found it confusing,
or dangerous or,

I don't know,
three to four times too long,

now's the time to share.

I --

I don't know what to say.
Leonard, do you know what to say?

Sheldon, I thought it,

it, uh, it (STUTTERS) looked like
you were having so much fun.

Hey, that's what you used to tell me

to say to Penny
after one of her terrible plays.

- Hey!
- Hey!

(SIGHS)

Well, what was wrong with it?

You know, did you find it

borderline psychotic?

I mean, I liked that about it,

but you guys discuss.

(STUTTERS) Do you remember when you were
a kid and you'd watch Professor Proton?

- Of course.
- Well, did he ever make you

hate science and the people who do it?

What are you saying?

(STUTTERS)
ljust think it would be better

if your contempt for children

wasn't so much in the foreground.

You want me to lie?

(SIGHS)
Look, it's not lying, it's acting.

Sheldon Cooper may not like kids,
but Professor Proton loves them.

Interesting.

You know, I hadn't really
thought of it that way.

It's, it's similar to how, you know,
I'm afraid of dogs

but my DnD character
likes dogs. You know?

But he's allergic,
so he can't be around them.

Why don't we have a dog?

Hey, you can always reshoot it.

Hmm, I suppose.

And, you know,
maybe I could even get some tips

from someone who's acted professionally.

Oh, Sheldon, obviously,
I'd be happy to help you out.

I don't know what to say.

Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

I need an acting coach.

Oh.

Would you give me
Patrick Stewart's number?

No.

Fine. I guess you can do it.

(BELL CHIMING)

HOWARD: Bernie!

Where did you get a bell?

APP store.

(BELL CHIMING)

- Fun, let me see.
-(CHUCKLES)

When you catch me, you can have it back.

You wanna lie down, watch a movie?

I can't. I got my
16-week check-up to get to

and then I'll pick up
some Chinese for dinner.

I'll take Halley with me.

You sure you're not overdoing it?

No, it's fine.

Great, then maybe instead of Chinese,

fire up the grill
and throw on a couple of steaks?

Kung Pao chicken, please.

- Oh, boy.
- What?

They cast the new Professor Proton.

- Is it Sheldon?
- Not exactly.

<i>SHELDON: Wheaten!</i>

It's Wil Wheaton.

BERNADETTE: <i>Hi.</i>

Hey.

How was the doctor?

Good, but I have some news.

Don't say twins, don't say twins.

It's not twins.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Only because I would
have loved them both.

The doctor said I was overdoing it,

so, she put me on bed rest
just to be safe.

Oh, no.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

It may not look like it,
but I'm running to you.

(INSECTS TRILLING)

Hello, Arthur.

What part of "rest in peace"

don't you understand?

I suppose you're here
because you heard the news.

Sheldon, I'm a figment
of your imagination.

I don't hear news.

You're a grumpy figment.

Look. They're remaking your show

and they cast Wil Wheaton
as Professor Proton.

And the worst part is,
he's not even a scientist.

No, the worst part is

I'm sitting on a moist log.

We have to stop this
and protect your legacy.

What legacy?

My, last two seasons, I was on
Sunday morning at 5:30.

We were beat by Davey and Goliath.

I can't believe you don't care.

Believe it.

Well, I care a lot.

And Wil Wheaton
will rue the day he ever met me.

I think that's true of most people.

Hi, guys.

Wanted to check in
and see how you two were doing.

- We're okay.
- Yeah,

hanging out in bed with my wife,

thawing out some frozen peas
in my pants, living the dream.

(BABY CRYING ON BABY MONITOR)

Oh, I'll get her.

I thought Raj was helping you out.

No, he had to work.

Plus, he has a quota for the amount
of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate.

Apparently, I filled it.

Well, hey, I can get the baby.

No, Howie's got it.

He's fine. Right, Howie?

(WINCING) Never better.

Don't be silly.
I'll take the rest of the day off

and watch Halley for you.

Or we can call Stuart.

I'm sure he could <i>close</i> up the store,
hop on a bus and be here in no time.

He does love the bus.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Okay, hang on. You guys don't trust me
to take care of your baby?

- No. (CHUCKLES)
- No.

- HOWARD: <i>No</i>. (CHUCKLES)
- BERNADETTE: <i>No</i>.

So, I guess,

<i>no. wens)</i>

Wow.

It's not that we don't trust you,
it's just,

you don't seem like
much of a baby person.

Hey! Hey, hey, I can watch
your stupid baby, okay?

If she cries, I will pick her up.

If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle.

And if she poops,
I'll light some incense.

It would be a big help.

Okay, thank you.

Trust me, you guys have
nothing to worry about.

You know, back in Nebraska,

I raised all our baby pigs right until
the day they were slaughtered.

So, unless your baby's
made of breakfast meat, she's fine.

Would you ever get a vasectomy?

Uh, in case you haven't noticed,
Indians aren't too big on birth control.

There's probably, like,
a million more of us

since we started this conversation.

(SHELDON SIGHS)

- You okay?
- No.

No. All these comments online about Wil,
they're nothing but supportive and kind.

Where's the mean, snarky Internet

that shows up every time
I get a haircut?

You know that's us, right?

Well, luckily, I got the number
of the company

who's trying to reboot the show,

so I need you all to call
and register your displeasure.

Sheldon, no one's gonna do that.

Not true. I know of three calls
they've received already.

A southern gentleman,

um, a Cockney chimney sweep,

and Mr. T. Hm.

Who, spoiler alert, pities the fool
who tries to reboot that show.

What about "tiresome lunatic with
a bad haircut"? Has he called yet?

Come on!

How many times have we banded together
to try to save a show that we loved?

(STUTTERS) Let's shake things up
and try to kill one.

Isn't the important thing

that there's a show
to get kids excited about science?

Who cares about kids and what they like?

This is about me and something I liked
when I was a kid.

What if the reboot is great?

That's even worse.

If-if I like it, I'll feel like
I'm being disloyal to Arthur.

He was a mentor and a friend,

And I won't toss him aside for some
Hollywood pretty boy like Wil Wheaton.

It's hard to argue with him.

Because he makes no sense? Yeah.

It's actually kind of nice,

you and me getting to spend
a couple days in bed together.

Yeah. Pretty soon, we're gonna have
two crying babies in the house.

(SIGHS)

I'm glad my balls hurt.
It's all their fault.

Well, let's just enjoy this quiet time
while we still got it.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Yeah, it is really quiet.

You think Penny's doing okay?

Penny? Everything all right?

Hey, all good. Dipped her pacifier
in a little bourbon,

she conked right out.

I hope you're joking.

Of course, I'm joking.
I don't share my bourbon.

She's joking.

(CHUCKLES) Definitely.

Probably.

Wil Wheaton. Wil Wheaton.

This is Sheldon, by the way.

Hi, Sheldon.

Here I found this pizza flyer
in your fence.

- Thank you.
- Okay, now you owe me a favor.

Turn down the role of Professor Proton.

(SIGHS) I don't think so.

You can't be Professor Proton.
You're not a scientist.

Well, I was never on a starship,

but pretending I was
bought me this house.

And if I'd pretended a little longer,
it would have a swimming pool.

Yeah, some things shouldn't be rebooted.

Some things were perfect
the way they were.

Uh, (STUTTERS)
like the walled city of York?

It was a delight. But New York?

(DISGUSTED GRUNT)

Did you ever consider that
maybe Arthur would be happy

to know that his show has outlived him?

I doubt it.
He was kind of a mean old crank.

Sheldon,

I promise that I will work my hardest
to make this show great,

so that a whole new generation of kids
will grow up

and they will be able to say that

Professor Proton was the reason
they got into science.

Wow.

That was very persuasive.

Thanks.

But I won't be seduced
by your acting skills

nor your movie star charisma.

There's only one Professor Proton

and he had neither of those things.

I'll give you one more chance
to bow out.

Or what?

When we first met, we were enemies.

But we worked through that
and we became friends.

Do you really wanna go back?

Honestly, it doesn't feel
very different.

I'm not leaving.

<i>WIL: All right,
I'm gonna sic my dog on you.</i>

You don't have a dog.

<i>WIL: Yes, I do.</i>

Oh, I can't tell if you're lying.
You're such a good actor.

Hey, how you doing?

What are you doing here?

Oh, ljust came by, you know,
to see if you need any help.

Howard and Bernadette
asked you to check up on me.

That is not entirely true.

So did Leonard and everybody.

How irresponsible do you all think I am?

We don't think you're irresponsible.

We think you're

fun-loving.

That is just a nice word
for irresponsible.

Hmm, you might be more on the ball
than we thought.

I'm getting a little hungry.

- Want me to get it this time?
-(SNIFFLES) Oh, that'd be great.

(BELL CHIMING)

This is fun.

And now you also get to see
an annoyed blonde walk into the room.

<i>(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</i>

What?

Can you get us a little snack?

Are you sure you don't want
your spy to do it?

What are you talking about?

You really don't trust me?
You had to have Amy stop by?

We trust you.

Yeah, you were a terrible waitress

and we still asked you
to get us a snack.

(BABY CRYING ON BABY MONITOR)

Excuse me, while I go
take care of your baby.

Then I'll bring you your snack
and you can insult me some more.

I don't know about you,

but I am not eating
whatever she brings us.

<i>PENNY". Hey, Halley! Oh, it's okay,
Aunty Penny's here.</i>

<i>Shh. Let's get you changed.</i>

<i>Your mommy and daddy say they trust me,</i>

<i>but they're full of the same stuff
your diaper is.</i>

(SIGHS) Now I feel bad.

Well, she never really liked me.

It's kind of nice
she hates you now, too.

<i>PENNY: Oh, but I'm here for you,</i>

<i>and I would never let
anything happen to you</i>

<i>because your Aunty Penny
loves you so much.</i>

HALLEY: Mama.

Was that her first word?

HALLEY: Mama.

<i>PENNY: No, no, baby, I'm not your mama.</i>

<i>Your mama's the nice lady
we're gonna go see right now</i>

<i>so I can rub this in her face.</i>

<i>Do you hear that, suckers?
She called me "Mama."</i>

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Hello, Arthur.

You know,

we could, we could also meet in a deli.

I'm sorry to say that I failed you.

I tried to stop Wil Wheaton
being Professor Proton,

but I couldn't.

See, now, that's the kind of thing

you could tell a fella over a

pastrami sandwich.

Well, don't worry,

he's now on my enemies list forever.

He's totally cut off.

Interesting.

Can anyone
sign up for that list?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Hey, uh, who's free tonight?

- Oh, I think I'm--
- Hang on,

we've made this mistake before.

It's how we wound up
at his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.

Hey, you use that collapsible bowl
all the time and you know it.

And it's not like that,

I just thought we could, you know,
hang out and go to a bar.

SHELDON: Very well.
HOWARD: That sounds fun.

And watch cricket.

That sound you hear?
Ironically, crickets.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bert, how you doing?

Well, you know,

we geologists always get a little sad
when Rocktober's over.

- Wordplay?
- Yes.

- Funny wordplay?
- What do you think?

Eh.

Trust your gut.

Sheldon, I've got these
four billion-year-old meteorites.

I thought maybe they'd show signs
of neutrino interactions.

I could really use someone like you
to help me with the math.

Oh, so they would act as
natural dark matter detectors.

- That sounds interesting.
- It does,

but it's still geology.

Sorry, Bert, I don't have time
to play rocks with you.

I'm not asking you to play rocks.

I'm asking you to collaborate
on a research project.

Although, if there's time,

I guess we could play a round of
zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.

Does sound better than cricket.

Uh, thank you for asking. Unfortunately,
I have real science to do.

But you feel free to rock on.

That's how you do it.

All right.

Sheldon, what are you doing?
Bert's one of the top guys in his field.

And somewhere there's a mime
who's top in his field,

but you don't see me rushing
to collaborate with him

on new ways to be stuck in a box.

Yeah, also something I would watch
instead of cricket.

Oh, (CHUCKLES) hello.

Hey, Sheldon.

Yeah, I've been thinking about it

and I suppose I could help you
with your research.

What changed your mind?

Bert, I'm a gift horse.
Don't look me in the mouth.

Sorry. I'm happy you wanna help out.

If it's easier for you
we could just work at your office.

What? No, no, no. Not in my office, no.

Uh, (STAMMERS) let's do it here,

in the evenings,

after everyone's gone home.

ljust have to see
if my evenings are free.

That's a joke. They are.

Okay. Well, then I will see you tonight.

(GASPS)

(EXCLAIMS)

You know what, (STAMMERING)

<i>close</i> the blinds,
we can start right now.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(ALL CHEERING)

I don't get how you can enjoy cricket.
It makes no sense.

Did you just come here to complain?

Yeah. That's the sport of my people.

Oh, that's Ravichandran Ashwin,
he's amazing.

He makes Hardik Pandya look like
Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Save some syllables for the rest of us.

Hey, I think that's
Bernadette's friend over there.

Oh, yeah. Hey, Ruchi.

I hope this isn't awkward.

The last time we met
I kind of embarrassed myself.

Hmm, let's see if you can
go two for two.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

- Hi.
- Are you here by yourself?

Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone
to come watch cricket with me.

(CHUCKLES) Tell me about it.
I had to drag this guy.

You're more than welcome
to join us if you'd like.

Thanks.

(CROWD GROANING)

(SPEAKING HINDI)

What'd she say?

(SPEAKING HINDI)

Ah, that clears that up.

She's telling the bowler
to bowl a yorker.

It's the most brutal ball in cricket.

I was at the match when Shoaib bowled
back-to-back yorkers.

I was there too. What a coincidence.

Well, there were 120,000 people
at that match, so...

(CHUCKLES) Yeah, India, right?

Everywhere you go
there's like 120,000 people. (CHUCKLES)

So, what do you think of our chances
at the World Cup?

Uh, World Cup. You know, it'll all
depend if Kohli's batting in form.

I know, it doesn't even matter
how many all-rounders you have.

Isn't that the truth.

You know, I was the best leg spinner
in my high school.

Yeah, like, I bowled the meanest googly.

Speaking of googlies, (CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna go.

I've been modeling different types
of dark matter

and the traces they would leave
on the zircon inside your meteorite.

What's this one here?

That's actually a dark matter model
of my own creation.

I call it the Cooper Boson.

Cool. I got to name a rock once.

I named it Moderately Sedimented Shale.

Guess I kind of pooped the bed
on that one.

You know, Bert, I have got to say,

this work has been
surprisingly engaging.

Yeah, it's pretty cool.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello, Amy.

What do you mean, where am I?

I'm in my office.

No, I'm at your office
and you're not here.

I thought I'd surprise you with dinner.

Wait, for future reference,
the best surprises

are the ones I know about
three days in advance.

Where are you?

(STUTTERS) I could say it's a surprise.
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

Well, I have food.
I thought we could eat together,

but I guess if you have other plans--

What? I'm here! (PANTING)

Exactly where I said I was.

(BREATHING HEAVILY) Let's eat.

- Hello.
- Hey, buddy, what's up?

Um, I need to talk to Penny alone.

(CHUCKLES)

- What can I do for you?
- Just a minute,

I wanna make sure Leonard can't hear us.
(CLEARS THROAT)

I've got a box of cupcakes.

Okay, we're good.

I'm working with Bert,

but I don't want anyone to find out.

Well, you just told me,
so, strong start.

Penny, this is serious.

My reputation is on the line.

What are people gonna think
when they see us collaborating?

I don't know. "Poor Bert"?

I am a respected theoretical physicist.

I aspire to win a Nobel Prize someday.

But no one is gonna take me seriously

if they find out I've been
dabbling in geology.

Well, why not? They're both sciences.

And I know, because they're classes

my high school counselor said
"weren't for me."

They're very different.

Physics answers the question,
"What is the nature of the universe?"

And geology answers the question,
"What'd ljust trip over?"

All right, well,
then don't work with Bert.

No, but I like the work.

- Then work with him.
- Yeah, but I'm ashamed of the field.

- Then don't work with him.
- Yeah, but we could prove dark matter.

- Then work with him.
- But I just think that people--

How many times are you gonna do this?

My record is 14.

Okay, (SIGHS) this is about science,
why'd you come to me?

Well, because it's also about
my reputation.

And somehow,
you manage to hold your head high

despite your checkered past.

"Checkered past"?

L's a figure of speech referring to
how sexually promiscuous you were.

Really? Well, I've got
a figure of speech

about how sexually promiscuous
you can go be with yourself.

And what is it?

Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest

we're gonna have to divide and conquer.

I've got one monitor for her,
one for the baby.

Which do you want?

I'll take the baby,
she's less emasculating.

Good morning. Scones?

- Ah, thanks.
- They're all for you,

I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.

You're kidding. You slept with her?

Well, there wasn't
a lot of sleeping involved.

I mean, she slept, I stayed awake.

I was afraid of snoring
'cause I didn't have my special pillow.

BERNADETTE: Howard!

<i>Can you help me to the bathroom?</i>

(SIGHS) At least the romance
is still alive.

- So...
-(RAJESH SIGHS)

You and Ruchi.

Yeah, I'm sorry,
I know you liked her too.

But we just bumped into each other
last night and hit it off.

Hmm, no, that's fine.

You're my friend and I'm happy for you.

Oh, thank you, Stuart.

Plus, I don't know how you're gonna
screw it up, but I know you will.

What's there to screw up?

She just wants to keep things casual.

Oh, great. That's how you're gonna
screw it up.

Hey, I can be casual.

Mmm-hmm. I should get a haircut,
this thing's going south fast.

So, Ruchi and I decided
to keep things casual.

(SCOFFS)

Wait-- What? I can handle casual.

(SCOFFS)

Why do you keep doing that
with your face?

Because you keep saying
stupid things with yours.

Okay, fine,

I'm not great at casual relationships

and I don't wanna scare her off.

All right.
Just give her some space, all right.

Don't call, don't text, don't e-mail.

That's crazy. What if I see a sunset
that reminds me of her?

All right, when do you see her next?

Uh, we're having dinner tonight.

Okay.

Put a rubber band around your wrist

and any time you start planning
your wedding or naming your children,

I want you to stab yourself
in the hand with a fork.

What's the rubber band for?

To slow the bleeding.

Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?

Well, she lies around all day
eating Mallomars and hollering at me,

so her transformation from
my wife to my mother is complete.

Congratulations, I know
that's what you were hoping for.

Hey, Sheldon, you left your jacket
in my office last night.

(STAMMERING) No, I didn't.
That's not my jacket.

Then why does it say
"Property of S. Cooper,

"stop touching it"?

That sounds like someone named Scooper
doesn't want you touching his jacket.

Are you guys working together
on that meteorite project?

(SIGHS) Yes, fine. You found me out.

I'm doing geology.

Just, please, don't tell anyone.

Are you embarrassed of me?

Oh, no, no, no. Not you.

No, just the work that
you've devoted your entire life to.

If you're ashamed to be working with me
then I don't wanna work with you.

Sheldon, that was pretty rude.

Yeah, well, what do you expect,
he's a geologist.

- This place seems nice.
- Yeah, uh,

but not too nice.
Yelp called it "good for groups."

- Would you care to buy the lady a--
- No! Get out of here.

(CHUCKLES) Sorry about that.

ljust-- I hate when someone assumes
two people are dating

just because they look like they would
make beautiful babies together.

Are you sure you're okay with this?

Honestly, Ruchi,

I don't have a lot of experience
with casual relationships.

I have some experience
with serious relationships

and a ton of experience
with no relationships.

- You're funny.
- Glad it came off that way. (CHUCKLES)

Uh, so, tell me about your day.

How's work going?

Well, I spent the morning reviewing
side effects for our fungal cream,

so it was lot of ooze and pus...

(MIKE RENO & ANN WILSON'S
"ALMOST PARADISE" PLAYING)

And then I had to catalog it by color,

viscosity

and percentage of blood.

Sounds wonderful.

- Hey.
- Hmm.

Whatcha got there?

(SIGHS)

A rock.

Did some mean boys throw it at you?

It turns out I'm the mean boy.

Although I did drop it on my own foot,
so, kind of.

What's going on?

What if there was something
I wanted to do,

but I was worried other people
would think less of me?

Is that other person me
and does it happen in the bedroom,

in which case, I think I'm cool with it?

No.

It's about working with Bert on...

You know what,
I'm not even gonna say it.

I am just gonna say
the letter it starts with

and "ology."

G... Oh, no, that's not gonna work.

- Geology?
- Yes.

But we parted ways because
I was worried about my reputation.

(SIGHS)

Sheldon,

you've never cared what people thought.

Even when you really, really should.

That dinner with my parents
comes to mind.

If I'm not gonna use "your momma" jokes
when I meet your mother,

why'd I bother to learn them?

I'm just saying,

if you think the work is interesting,

nothing else should matter.

You're right, Amy.

That is sage advice.

Which is surprising considering
your momma is so dumb, she--

Nope.

She studied for a urine test. (LAUGHS)

I was supposed to go back
to India and get married,

but I realized it wasn't what I wanted.

So I called off the engagement
and moved out here.

Well, if he wasn't your soulmate,
he wasn't your soulmate.

Oh, God, please tell me
you're not one of those.

One of what?

I wanna say "teenage girls,"

but that sounds mean.

Come on. You don't believe that
everyone has one perfect match?

Of course not. That's ridiculous.

I mean, what if your soulmate
lived halfway across the world?

- You'd never meet.
- Yes, you would.

I can give you, like, 20 examples

where that happened
to Kate Hudson alone.

You know what, people get upset
when I talk about this.

Let's just change the subject.

No, no, no. No, it's fine.

Are you saying that you don't believe
two people fall in love?

Of course, they do.
It's just that what people call "love"

is actually a series of
biochemical reactions in the brain

that fade over time.

Ah, yes. Like the old song,

<i>When a Man Has a Biochemical Reaction
for a Woman.</i>

Raj, we're scientists.

We don't need to feel threatened
just because we understand

the mechanisms that give rise
to romantic feelings.

It doesn't take anything away
from the experience.

Yes, it does.

Actually, it takes everything
away from it.

Love isn't just science, okay.

(STAMMERS) It's spiritual.

It's an acknowledgment of a mystery
that's greater than ourselves.

It's what makes people
write songs and poems

and what has kept The Bachelor on TV
for 21 magical seasons.

Don't you think the fact

that love is given away
as a prize on a game show

slightly undermines your argument?

Uh, yes, but I've
never missed an episode

and I dare science to explain that.

Bert? Bert, Bert?

Bert, Bert, Bert?

What do you want, Sheldon?

I would like us to work together again.

And I promise to keep
my geology comments to myself

because while some of them are funny,

all of them are mean.

Well, this is awkward.

Leonard, what are you doing here?

Bert asked for my help.

Yeah. He's an excellent scientist

and he doesn't tell me
what time I can go to the bathroom.

It's called bladder training,

and when you're in your 80s
you'll thank me for it.

Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert,
and he walked away from you.

So I feel like there's a lot
he could teach me.

Bert, please.

(SIGHS) I know I behaved poorly
in the past,

but things will be different this time.
You'll see.

Come on.

Let me in.

We'll have some laughs,

we'll calculate some isotope ratios.

I'm sorry, Sheldon.

(DOOR CLOSES)

So, you just shut the door in his face?

I gotta start writing this stuff down.

I mean, Ruchi is nice,

we're just so different.

I know. Sometimes when you're dating
you meet weird people.

I once met a girl
who didn't like juggling. (CHUCKLES)

And she still doesn't.

So you're not gonna see her again?

(SIGHS) What's the point? We're never
gonna be in a real relationship.

Right. So you'll only be
in a physical one?

Exactly. Why would I wanna spend time
with someone like that?

Someone who is just interested in sex?

Yeah.

- Raj, do you really--
- Wait! Hold on, give him a chance.

He's gonna get this.

I don't think he is.

What is there to get?

She doesn't want to fall in love.

At that point, all we are

is two single people who find
each other attractive and enjoy having--

Oh, gotta go. (CLEARS THROAT)

So, how was your night with Ruchi?

Oh, great. We ordered in some food,

we had sex, I left.

I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.

(HOWARD CHUCKLES)

I can field that one for her.

I mean, I did get a little misty
when we said goodbye,

but I played it off as allergies.

I don't know if she bought it.

Again, I know.

Sheldon?

You Okay?

Sheldon.

(MIKE RENO & ANN WILSON'S
"ALMOST PARADISE" PLAYING)

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Can we start the movie?

Before Sheldon gets here?

Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

So do it!

Hold on. Where is he?

Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

(INCOMING MESSAGE ALERT)

"All tied, and..."

- Hello!
- Hi.

Sorry we're late.
Amy took forever tying my shoe.

All right!
Who's excited to see a documentary?

Oh, I know this one.
Nobody ever.

Hey! This one's
going to be great.

This is about the rivalry

between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

And it's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

Done.

So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

(ALL LAUGHING)

No, Penny.
No, the car is just named after him.

Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

You know, you went
to see the movie <i>It</i>

because you thought
it was about scary l.T. guys.

Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

Didn't he invent the light bulb?

Mmm, that's what
he wants you to think.

But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue
or James Bowman Lindsay.

Isn't he sexy all fired up?

He really gets my current alternating,
if you know what I mean.

Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

just to make himself famous.

If I had an elephant named Topsy,
he would want for nothing.

Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

<i>so</i> he's basically
a pornographer.

Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

someone takes it out.

Is your current still alternating?

We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

You know, that documentary
last night was actually

better than I
thought it would be.

Really?

Should've been about
Samuel Morse

the way they telegraphed
that ending.

You know, I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

Do I have to do it again?

Yeah, I'd appreciate it. (CHUCKLES)

(FORCED CHUCKLE)
Samuel Morse. You kill me.

Leonard, can you
drive me to work?

Yeah, sure.
Hey, the guys and I

were talking about
going to see the Tesla coil

at the observatory later on,
if you want to join.

Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

- Why? What are you doing?
- Leonard, what are you doing?

He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

It's fine.
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.

- What does that mean?
- Leonard!

Sad face, sad face.

I mean, I would like to,
but ljust can't, you know,

because it's classified
and top secret.

Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

I'm so glad
you figured that out!

It was killing me
keeping it a secret!

I thought they fired you guys.

They did,
but then they hired me back.

Well, you better not be
working on our project,

because we're a team.

Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

However, there is an "I" in

"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

There's five of them, in fact.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey, hey.
I got a big surprise for you.

Is it pie and ice cream?

Wow, did I oversell it.

It's Raj and Ruchi!

- Hello.
- Hey. Hi.

Hey, what are
you two doing here?

We won't stay long.
ljust wanted to drop something off

from me and the girls at work.

None of the girls at work
like me enough to get me a gift.

Okay, so you'll know
why everyone at the office

has the same handwriting.

I really appreciate the thought,

but it's not necessary.
I'll be back soon.

Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.

Yeah, just turn off your brain

and let your uterus do its magic.

It's the star of the show now.

Okay, wasn't sure how long
I should let you guys stay.

Now I know! Get out!

Good to see you. You look amazing.

Thanks for coming!

That bitch.

Come on, he means well. He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

I'm talking about Ruchi.
She's after my job.

Why do you think she said,
"Take all the time you need?"

Because she was being nice?

No, she's trying to steal
my projects while I'm at home

taking care of this useless
plant and my dumb family.

I'm only saying this
because I love you

and because you can't
reach me from that bed,

but you sound a little crazy.

I love you, too, but I could
fling this card in your eye

like a ninja throwing star.

I don't believe you.

Why would the military want Sheldon?

I don't know. Target practice?

Well, he better not be
working on our guidance system.

That was my idea.

Why don't we call Colonel Williams
and find out what's going on.

Great. I want answers,
and he'd better give them to us.

(LINE RINGING)

- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hi, sir. Leonard has a question.

Hey, is Sheldon working on
our project again?

- Did he say that?
- No, he wouldn't tell us.

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>So he can
keep his mouth shut.</i>

<i>How do I get him to do that?</i>

ls he working on
our guidance system or not?

<i>Dr. Cooper contacted us
with an idea on how to modify</i>

<i>your technology into
a communication system,</i>

<i>and it seemed interesting.</i>

But our team developed
that technology.

<i>And he was your team leader.</i>

Well, who said
he was team leader?

<i>He did.</i>

<i>And I like that kind of
"take charge" attitude.</i>

We can have "take charge" attitudes.

<i>Then why didn't either of you
ask to be team leader?</i>

We didn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

Yeah, so we were just waiting for you to
tell us who you thought--

Okay, I hear it.

- Are we done?
- LEONARD: No, no.

lam taking charge right now
and telling you

that it is not okay
with us if--

Okay, bye.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey. I just got your text.
Everything okay?

Yeah, there's just something
I need to ask you.

-(GASPS) Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled.
- It's not be my birth coach.

Okay, that hurts, but luckily I
know how to breathe through it.

(DOING LAMAZE BREATHING)

I need you to find out
if Ruchi's trying to steal

my projects at work
while I'm on bed rest.

Come on, she's not that
kind of a person.

She's generous and charitable.

You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

Yes, that's my favorite charity.

I know I sound paranoid,
but I'm feeling really vulnerable.

If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

Nothing.

I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

Ah. Okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

but the way you're saying it

is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

What do you want to watch?

Oh, why don't you pick?

Okay, how about comedy?

Eh, I already laughed today.

I know. It was when I stubbed my toe.

(CHUCKLES) Still funny.

Drama?

Nah, I've already seen
someone cry today.

It really hurt, Sheldon!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey. We talked to Colonel Williams.

He told us everything.

I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

What's going on?

Sheldon went to the Air Force
behind our backs.

I did nothing of the sort.

I had an idea

for a neutrino-based
communication system,

I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

But your communication system

was based on our guidance system.

And sonar is based on bats.

You don't see them
hanging upside down

in a patent attorney's office.

You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

- You take that back.
- No, he's right.

You are a bully, a credit hog
and a self-promoter.

And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

Yeah.

Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less.

Well, you are
building on their work

and taking the credit for it.

That's a classic Edison move.

Oh, yeah?

Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

then what does that say
about you?

- I honestly don't know.
- Okay.

Well, I have to google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

I'll be right back.

You know whose fault this is?

I do. Yours.

No, my mother's.

"Go make friends, Sheldon."

What happens?
Twenty years later, they call me names.

I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

Oh, yeah? How would you feel

if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

Of course.

Not me?

Then no.

Do you think they're right, Amy?

Do you think I'm like Edison?

Sheldon, I don't think you're upset

because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

I think you're upset because
your friends' feelings got hurt.

You're right.

I care too much about
other people's feelings.

It's always been my fatal flaw.

Sheldon, I don't think--

No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

That was fun.

Put her there, buddy.

lam not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

There's a difference
between casual and weird.

Not the way I do it.

So, how was your day?

Like, how's work?

Oh, great. With Bernadette gone,

I'm getting to handle all her projects.

Well, she's not gone.
She'll be back soon.

Not too soon, let's hope.

So it turns out Ruchi is totally

trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

It was so beautiful.

Our caramel-colored bodies

were entwined like erotic taffy--

Get to the point!

Sorry, yeah.

(STAMMERING) I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

Can't believe she
would take advantage

of a pregnant lady like that.
So what did you do?

What do you think I did?

I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

You have to say
something to Bernie.

I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

who's trying to screw
over your friend.

Can't or must?

You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

You figured out how to make it work.

We didn't even need Sheldon.

Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

as the basis for
a communication system.

Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

Ooh, so instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

It would be way more efficient.

And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

<i>so</i> coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

You're brilliant!

- We should tell Sheldon.
- You're an idiot!

We don't tell Sheldon.

We go to the military
behind his back

and we screw him
like he screwed us.

Yeah, yeah. All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

We can do this all on our own.

Do you think
you can do the math?

No.

But if someone else does it,

I can double check
the crap out of it.

I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

So, is she trying
to steal my projects?

No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

Here, have a brownie.

- L'm gonna kill her.
- Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi.

Is she trying to take your job? Yes.

Is she parking in your space? Yes.

Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

But you would've done the exact
same thing and you know it.

I never would've
undermined a coworker.

What? Oh, please.
What about that guy Eric

who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

when you knew
your boss had asthma?

That was just a hilarious prank

that ended with me
getting a corner office.

All I'm saying is

before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

take a long hard look
in the mirror,

because you know what you'll see,

apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

Hypocrisy!

It is thick.

So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

Uh, ljust need to use the cross section

to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

Can we help?

Yes.

Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

Leonard, I was--

What's Kripke doing here?

He's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

making yours obsolete.

Yeah, Leonard thought of it.

- It's genius.
- Thanks.

You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

- Good God, man, shut up!
- Right, sorry.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

You didn't tell me we were doing this
just to stick it to Sheldon.

- Oh, well...
-l'm messing with you.

This sundae just got a cherry on top!

Fine. Good luck to you.

The military is already
interested in my system,

and my math is worked out.

His still has a big gap in it.

Where?

- There.
- What?

- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

I've been trying to ask Bernadette,
but she's not answering any of my texts.

Yeah, listen, I think she might be

a little threatened by you, you know,

because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

Did she say something to you?

No.

I mean, well, kind of.

But it's okay. She's just hormonal.

And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

I don't need you to stand up for me.

You're not my boyfriend.

Look, I care about you,

and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

I can't believe she dumped me.

This is tough for me, 'cause I can.

Sorry things worked out like that.

Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

Let's just leave it at, "I'm sorry."

You're already sad.

Based on Kripke's calculations,
I think this is gonna work.

Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. Military?

I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

Without committing criminal espionage?

You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

What are you talking about?

The military canceled my project,
because they're going with yours.

That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

Damn it!

Excuse us.

Kripke.

- What's up, fellas?
- Did you screw us over?

Ooh, I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

This is all your fault.

No, it's your fault.

If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

None of this would've happened.

Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

and you deserve what you got.

Well, that doesn't help at all.

You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

I can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

who didn't invent the electric car

and less like the guy
who didn't invent the light bulb.

She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

(SIGHS) You may have a point
about her social skills.

He wasn't insane.

He did fall in love with a pigeon.

Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

for loving something
small and unappealing,

might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Why are they making
four more Avatar movies?

It's not like the first one
was even that good.

What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

You even went as Avatar
for Halloween.

(CHUCKLES) I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

Hell, guys.

-Hey.
-Hey.

I'm, I'm running a special today.

Buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

Well, this is awkward.
I was actually gonna return this.

- What's wrong with it?
- I finished it.

Speaking of something
I find interesting,

did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

is worth about $5,000 now.

Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

Yeah, it was seven years ago.

Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

<i>(SINGING) Tik Tok, on the clock</i>

Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

No, we definitely mined some.

I remember sitting in your bedroom
and writing the program.

I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

'cause I was totally there.
I remember now.

- I can't believe we forgot about it.
- It's not that surprising.

They were basically worthless
when we got them.

I wish I knew how much we had.

Sheldon, you must remember.

Of course I do.

Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember.

You tell them, Sheldon.

I can't believe you haven't
seen Avatar yet.

What is wrong with you?

Penny and ljust started dating,
and you know I don't like big crowds.

Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

Terrified.

Yes, instead of going out,

they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I do like to hear it.

Yes, Ma, I'll be home for dinner.

No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

We're having brisket?

Be home at 6:00.

Hey, maybe we should double date.

I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

Make your jokes, but my date started
a savings account for me.

Did yours?

- Hey, you guys-
- Hey.

Stuart, good. I was wondering,

will you be accepting Bitcoin?

Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

and my cash register doesn't,
so yeah.

Wait, what's Bitcoin?

It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

It's just like actual money,

except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

If it's not tangible,
how do you know

it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

that could vanish tomorrow?

I'll buy some Bitcoin.

ljust came into a little extra money

when my dad raised my allowance.

You don't have to buy Bitcoin.

You can mine it.

Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

Sort of. There's a limited amount,

and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

So let me get this straight.

We have to write an elaborate program

in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

- Yes.
- That sounds fun.

Yeah, I'm in.

Staying up late,

writing code, it sounds like a party.

Hey, Stuart.
You want to mine some Bitcoin with us?

We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

Too rich for my blood.

All right, so just the four of us.

(GASPS) Before we begin,

this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

(GASPS) Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

Great, so just the three of us.

Oh, yeah. We did it without you.

And do you remember
what happened next?

Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

And after that?

You said that someday
we'd regret this.

And do you know what today is?

The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

(ALL LAUGHING)

Yeah, that's right! Up top!

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, this is the laptop
I was using in 2010.

The Bitcoin must be on here.

So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

Ah, well, as a responsible adult,

I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

and then buy a tiger.

How about you?

That depends on
whether I tell Bernadette or not.

(SMIRKS)

BERNADETTE:
Howard, <i>I</i> can hear you.

<i>The baby monitor is on.</i>

I know. I was joking.

I'm gonna put it in a college fund.

(MOUTHING)

(DEVICE TURNING ON)

All right, all booted up.

Wow, I knew you were single back then,
but that is a lot of porn...

Science! A lot of science.

Wow, you were really into Asian science.
(CHUCKLES)

I don't see the Bitcoin on here.

Hey, maybe it's in that folder marked
"Private and Confidential."

BERNADETTE:
<i>It's</i> not!

Okay, the program
is almost ready to run.

Mining for coins sounds so manly.

Ooh, we should sing a mining song.

Do you know a mining song?

I don't know.

Does "Tik Tok" by Kesha count?

Because it has tunneled
its way into my heart.

<i>MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, what's going on?</i>

<i>Are you boys roughhousing?</i>

No, we're not roughhousing!

We're scientists!
Scientists don't roughhouse!

<i>MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up.</i>

Aw, man, what happened?

It crashed.

It's been doing that lately.

I think it's got a virus from all the
music I've been downloading.

Music I've been downloading.

What kind of music?

Mostly Asian.

Some oldies.

Well, we can use my laptop.

MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, <i>I</i> made cookies

<i>for you and your little friends!</i>

They're not my little friends,
and we don't want cookies!

Actually, a cookie sounds good.

All right, we'll have cookies!

Thank you very much!

That's right.
It must be on my old laptop.

Well, let's go.

Hey, Bernie, you mind
if I run to Leonard's and...

<i>BERNADETTE:
Get a laptop full of money?</i>

<i>Why are you still here?
Go, go, go!</i>

So, how's the wedding planning going?

Great. Although, we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.

I thought you were looking
at a cliff on the beach.

We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

And all of them
were too outsidey.

Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

- Hi.
- PENNY: Hey.

What are you guys doing?

We have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

What... You're kidding.

No. We could be sitting on a fortune.

Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for the money,

but you just got
way more attractive.

Damn it, it's not in here.

If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

I bet they would know
what happened to it.

If you know, just tell us.

Well, excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

you don't want me
to be a part of this.

Sheldon, you can't still be mad.

Oh, please.

I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

Yes. That night,
I'm going to have the first dance

and the last laugh.

Sheldon, please.

Should I be the bigger man?

I think you should.

(CHUCKLING) Why'd <i>I</i> ask you?

Hey there, pretty lady.

I'm not waiting on your table for you.

Come on, this one is so annoying.

Excuse me, waitress.

You guys ready to order?

Can you take our picture, please?

Oh, sure.

Smile!

(CAMERA CLICKS)

Perfect.

Thank you. You may go now.

It was nice to meet you,

and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

What was that?

I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

If she thinks
I faked the picture,

I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

Bernadette.

- Hey, sweetie. Everybody good?
- Hey.

- Yeah.
- Fine.

You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

Or you could just speak.

- You having a good day?
- No, I missed an audition

because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

Would've been a perfect part for me.

Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

Because that's the role
you were born to play.

Just shut up and eat your burger.

Actually, it's a turkey club.

Didn't you order a burger?

I did, and yet here we are.

You know what, if you need a computer,
you can use my laptop.

That's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

It's fine.
I'm getting a new one anyway.

- Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

He's desperate
to hold on to you.

You can get anything out of him.

His car, his watch...

Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

You can start a collection.

Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

That was so sweet.

- So you know where it is?
- Of course.

- Great!
- All right!

I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.

"No!

Okay, Zack, thank you so much.
We'll be right over.

He still has it.

I can't believe you took
a gift from me

and gave it to another man.

<i>SHELDON: Really?</i>

Of all the things she's given
to other men,

that's what you're
concerned about?

Please don't make
a big deal about this.

It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

Which breakup was that? Was that
the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?

No, no.

This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

You have names for our breakups?

Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

So did Howard and Bernadette.

Not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

Thanks. ljust didn't think he was

the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

to do after a breakup
is to take some time

and be by yourself.

Yeah, that's healthy.

Hey, babe, ready to go?

Do as I say, not as I do.

I cannot believe you're mad.

What... I'm not mad.

Oh. Really? Tell that to your eyebrows.

Bet I could place
a quarter between them,

and it would just stay there.

Fine, I'm mad.

I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

Didn't seem like it.

You started dating the first

tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

I'm sorry, are you mad
that I dated Zack or that you didn't?

- Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

So good to see you guys.

Man, we should
do this more often.

Come over to get laptops
back from you?

Totally.

So do you have it?

Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

You don't get rid
of something like that.

Huh.

All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

Are you guys fighting?

- Yeah.
- No.

Are you fighting about
whether or not you're fighting?

'Cause I've had that fight before.

Turns out we were, and I lost.

Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

That's crazy.

When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

In fact, I think
she only dated me

because I reminded her of you.

Sure.

Because we're both

people?

Damn right we are.

Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

- What video?
- The one on the laptop.

I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

Ask my neighbor. She'll tell you.

But not right now, she's in the shower.

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

(SIGHS) Hello, Leonard.

I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

and spelling is
a sober person's game, so...

I feel I owe you a 'splanation.

<i>I... I'm sorry.</i>

A 'splanation.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- SHELDON: Penny. Penny.

<i>Penny.</i>

Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll come back when you're alone.

No, no, no. I am alone.

I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

Oh, he knows.

The video I want to see

is why you went out with him
in the first place.

I went out with him
because he's great.

And if I kept going out with him,
I probably would've married him,

and that's a little scary

because ljust don't think
I'm ready for that.

You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

I know there's a "D" in there,

but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

Sheldon, what do I do?

Try to pass out face down,
so you don't choke on your vomit.

<i>I am not gonna pass out.</i>

But thank you anyway.

- Wow.
- I know.

There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

Aw, you love me so much.

- I married you, jackass.
- Yeah.

<i>I...</i> I know, and not just out of pity

like everyone said at our wedding toast.

You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

- No.
- Totally.

(THUDS)

- That's my wife.
-(CHUCKLES)

I got to see that again.

- Got the laptop.
- Hand it here.

Yep.

This is so exciting!

Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

all the money you took from him
over the years?

Never even crossed my mind.

Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.

Yeah, how much is in there?

It's empty.

What? That's impossible.

Do you think Zack stole it?

He doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin.

I mean, he waves at trucks.

Hmm.

Who could it have been?

Sheldon, what did you do?

I plotted my revenge.

If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

What, you stole our Bitcoin?

Oh, calm down.
All I did was sneak onto your computer

and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

- What?
- But I'm not keeping it.

I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

If you want to watch him sweat,

walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

Where's our money?

That's the best part.

It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

You've had it
in your pocket all along.

(GASPS)

Sheldon,

I lost that key chain years ago.

Really?

(STAMMERS) Did you look under things?

Well, that is unfortunate.

I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

- What was the lesson?
- I don't know.

<i>STUART: Huh. What's that?</i>

<i>Ooh. Batman flash drive.</i>

<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

<i>Huh, if I erase this,</i>

<i>I could probably resell it
for, like, 10 bucks.</i>

<i>Things are finally going my way.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

This was a good idea.

It's been a long time
since we've had girls' night.

Yeah. It's so nice to
have a relaxing evening

at home doing nothing.

<i>Yeah, really breaks up
the other 30 days</i>

<i>I've spent on bed rest
doing nothing.</i>

Well, tonight we're gonna
make you forget all that.

<i>You're gonna make me forget
I've been stuck in bed</i>

<i>while a baby uses my bladder
as a kickball?</i>

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey, you had unprotected sex
with Howard.

You deserve to be miserable.

Hey, I need some fashion advice.

Really? From me?

- I would love to-
- Actually, Leonard told me

Penny was over here?

Hey, what's going on?
You got a date?

I do have a date, with science.

Oh, what's science wearing?

The Griffith Observatory is
looking for an astrophysicist to consult

And I have an interview tomorrow.

Oh, I love the observatory.

They tell you your weight
on all the different planets.

Yeah. It's always
bikini season on Venus.

I think you'd be great at that.

Don't you agree, Bernadette?

<i>Huh? I'm listening. I'm listening.</i>

<i>I'm not watching The Crown.</i>

I just want to make
a good first impression,

and thought maybe you could
help me pick out an outfit.

Of course. Let's see what you got.

Yeah, you just need
to pick something

that you feel confident in.

I'm sorry.
I left my magic clothes at home.

I'm sure these two options will be...

So you have other clothes at home?

It doesn't matter.
They're talking to a bunch of people.

I probably won't get it anyway.

Well, don't say that.

Yeah, you have to believe in yourself.

You know,
before I came to America,

I was filled with confidence.

What happened to me?

<i>Hey, is that Raj there
at girls' night?</i>

Oh, hey. Hey, Howard.

<i>Just remember,
if you fall asleep first,</i>

<i>they're gonna freeze your bra.</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

You and Amy having fun
planning your wedding?

We're employing a mathematical approach
called decision theory,

so, heck, yeah.

"Heck, yeah"?

Looks like someone needs to put a dollar
in the almost-swear jar.

We've assigned all wedding
decisions randomly,

and each of us makes half of them.

From venue to officiant

to numbering system for the tables,
Roman or Dewey Decimal.

Why not hexadecimal?

'Cause this is our wedding, not a joke.

Hell, guys.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Oh, good. Raj is here

to tell us today's specials.

Very funny.
I have my interview this afternoon.

Aw, if it doesn't work out, you're ready
to go on your Mormon mission.

I don't understand what's going on here.

Uh... What's going on here is
I'm up for a job at the planetarium,

and Howard is making fun of me.

Oh, it's great.
You're both doing what you love.

Well, I'm excited for you.

Oh. Thanks, yeah.
I'd be in charge of developing

and narrating all
the planetarium shows.

And I really want this, so it wouldn't
kill you to be more supportive.

But if it did, you could bury me
at the funeral home you direct.

Wait. The premise is that
he is dressed differently?

Yeah.

(CHUCKLING) That's true.
He is not dressed the same.

(PHONE RINGING)

<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Hello, Rajesh.</i>

<i>How was the interview?</i>

Not so great.

They asked me
what my biggest weakness was,

and 45 minutes later,
they thanked me for coming.

<i>Son, don't take this the wrong way,
but what's your problem?</i>

I would tell you, but apparently
it takes 45 minutes.

<i>You know what?</i>

<i>I bet it's those friends
you surround yourself with.</i>

<i>Like that Howard,
always making fun of you.</i>

Howard doesn't mean anything by it.

<i>I think it's cultural.</i>

His people come
from a very sarcastic village

called Brooklyn.

<i>Don't make excuses.</i>

<i>What kind of friend acts that way?</i>

- Well, I guess...
- It was a rhetorical question.

<i>A bad friend!</i>

Come on, Dad!
That's just our relationship, okay?

He makes Indian jokes,
and I laugh,

but, you know, with angry eyes,
so he knows it's not okay.

<i>L, too, was in a relationship</i>

<i>with someone who made me
feel bad about myself.</i>

If you're talking about Mom,
I don't want to hear it.

<i>I'm just saying,
if you replace Howard</i>

<i>with a nice 22-year-old
grad student,</i>

<i>your self-confidence will soar.</i>

All right, Amy, you're up.

Next decision.

Come on, first dance!

- Oh!
-Invitations!

That's a good one.

Just a suggestion,

hologram projected out of R2-D2.

Thanks for your input,
but this is my decision,

and I'm gonna go with...

Old English calligraphy
on Egyptian papyrus.

(GASPS) What a fun mashup.

It's like the chicken
and waffles of orthography.

Your turn.

Ring bearer! Boy, I'm so glad
that R2-D2 is still available.

You know,
this is really fun.

I can't believe that people say
that planning a wedding

is one of the most
stressful things in life.

I know. Not a day goes by
that I don't marvel

how much better we are
than other people.

I'm so sorry the interview
didn't go well.

Yeah, you would've been perfect for it.

ljust get so nervous,

and then I start apologizing
for being nervous, and...

You guys don't want
to hear about this. I'm sorry.

Stop apologizing!

Oh, my God! You sound just like
the woman at the interview!

Have you ever thought about talking

to some kind of therapist
about all this?

(SIGHS) Maybe.

Hey, Leonard, do you think
your mom would be available?

Yeah, you don't want to do that.

Talking to my mom to get more confidence

is like talking to a lion
to get more alive.

Well, my dad thinks

it's because Howard's always
making fun of me.

That makes sense.

What do you mean,
that makes sense?

Howard does make fun of him a lot.

(SCOFFS)
That's not all Howard's fault.

I mean, if Raj doesn't want
to be made fun of, then I...

I don't know a nice way
to finish this sentence.

So you're on his side?

I'm just saying,
that's what friends do.

You know, they bust on each other.

It doesn't mean anything.

Well, I'm not surprised
you think so.

Why is that?

You can be kind of mean to me.

Well, that's because you're...

Wow. I don't know how
to finish that sentence, either.

You know what?

I think we're both clone
being disrespected.

I got a few rounds left in me.

Attaboy, champ.

Okay, let's see what
we've got so far.

<i>I arrive in</i> a
<i>Little House on the Prairie- style</i>

horse-drawn buggy.

Where you are met with
an honor guard of stormtroopers.

Do you think that might be jarring,

going from wholesome pioneers
to space Nazis?

I see what you're saying.

You're thinking
that you should arrive

in a replica
of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.

It's not what I'm thinking.

And to save you
the trouble for the future,

it will never be what I'm thinking.

Well, if the ushers are
so important to you,

what if I propose a trade?

You may pick that, and I will decide,
say, first dance.

Great. Then the ushers
will be my cousins

dressed in frontier frock coats.

And the first dance will be
that we won't have one.

All right. Then our second dance
will be the first dance.

Unless we have no dance at all. Ha-ha.

Well, if we're changing things,

then instead of throwing confetti,

we'll release butterflies.

Airborne worms?
Have you lost your mind?

Well, if you're going to do that,

then I am changing the officiant

to that husky Spider-Man

that hangs out at the Chinese Theater.

Fine. Wedding toasts in Latin.

Great. Vows in Klingon.

Then I'm changing the
flower girl to a dog.

And guess what he'll be
scattering instead of petals!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Want to grab some lunch?

You know what?
I don't think so.

Well, let me guess.
You're not eating

because the mean girls circled
your chubby bits in marker?

No. That. That right there.
That's the reason.

You're always making fun of me.

(CHUCKLES) Those are just jokes.

It's my way of saying
that we're friends,

and it wouldn't hurt
you to drop a few.

See? No wonder
I don't have any confidence.

Come on. You can't blame that on me.

Why not? 15 years of constant ridicule.

I think our relationship
has become toxic.

What are you saying?

I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

Look, I can see you're upset, but...

I'm gonna need some ground rules.

While we're apart,
can I see other needy Indian men?

Get out!

What do you think will make
the wedding worse for Amy,

a cake made with salt
instead of sugar

or a cake iced
with congealed gravy?

Well, that is a trick question.

The answer is,
you as the groom.

Neither of them
will be the actual cake.

I'm just using it
as a bargaining chip

to get Amy to agree to the whole
wedding party getting rings

and us getting one ring
to rule them all.

I forget, which mental hospital
are you guys registered at?

- Hello.
- Hello.

Really? You're not gonna sit here?

I'll sit there <i>as</i> soon as you leave.

You're still on this?
I said sorry.

Well, "sorry" doesn't make up
for years of emotional abuse.

Well, what's it gonna take?

You want half my sandwich?

What is going on?

Raj is trying to blame me
for his pathetic life.

His life isn't pathetic.

He's got that whole table
to himself.

Well, one of us should go sit with Raj
so he's not alone.

But I'm not done telling you
about my wedding revenge plans.

You're right. Go on.

Okay, well, first, I'm going to try

to get Amy to trade with me
for <i> hors d'oeuvres...</i>

Oh, good, you're here.

I've decided on our centerpieces.

ljust hope your family
isn't allergic to asbestos.

Sheldon, please stop.

If we keep doing this,
we're gonna end up with a wedding

that neither one of us will enjoy.

Are you saying
you don't want to get married?

No, of course I do.

But that seems to be
the one thing we can agree on.

Maybe we should just
get married at City Hall

and forget about everything else.

City Hall. Hmm.

I do like metal detectors

and the sound of permits being denied.

Right.

And if we're not enjoying
planning this wedding,

then what's the point?

Well, historically, a wedding
was to let other potential suitors know

that we're unavailable.

But I think matching T-shirts that say

"Hands off the merchandise"
accomplish the same thing.

So let's pick a day
and just go do it.

How about tomorrow?

Really?

That soon?

Why wait?

I mean, it's not that I think
we're living in sin,

but I do like the idea
that our next act of intimacy

will be a legal requirement.

Tomorrow, we'll go downtown
and get married.

Or we could go to
Beverly Hills City Hall

if you want a destination wedding.

Hey. You look good today.

What happened? What's wrong?

Just tell me. I can take it.

Nothing. I felt bad
about being mean to you,

so I'm being nice.

Oh, okay. Sorry. I wasn't ready for it.

Try again?

You look handsome.

Nope, still freaking me out.

- Hello, friends!
- Hey.

Hey, what's going on with your hair?

Nothing. ljust decided
to stop straightening it.

Wait, so you were making your hair
look like that on purpose?

When I first moved to America,
I wanted to fit in.

And Howard's hair was straight,

and he was the coolest person I knew.

Then you never saw any other people?

You know what, I don't want
to talk about Howard.

I came here to celebrate!

Yeah. I went back
to the planetarium and told them

they were making a huge mistake,
that I'd be perfect for the job.

I was charming, I was confident.

And they gave it to me.

- That's amazing!
- Yeah, plus,

it turns out the guy they hired

got busted
at a sketchy massage parlor.

So, happy ending for you!

Oh, and for him.

Yeah, I was on my way
to tell Howard,

and then I remembered
I wasn't speaking to him,

so I came over here.

Don't you think it's time
you two made up?

No.

No, actually.
I don't need his negative energy

in my life right now.

Standing up to him was hard,

but it made me realize
that I can do anything.

And, yeah, it's a little sad,
but, you know,

-life is all about-
-(CORK POPS OPEN)

Sorry.
I thought you were wrapping things up.

- Hey, Howard.
- Hey.

Where is everybody?

I could ask you
the same question.

Wow, this conversation got mean fast.

Sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

Yeah? What's going on?

I had a falling out with Raj.

He said I make fun of him too much

and that it's wrecked his confidence.

Please.
Confidence is like red blood cells.

Nice if you got some,
but you don't need 'em.

Yeah. I mean, your life's a mess.

I don't see you blaming
other people for it.

That's right. I grew up in a
loving, supportive household.

This is all on me.

Maybe I'll just hang out here
for a while.

Great. And you can make fun of me
all you want.

No, that's okay.

No, no, no. Go on. I can take it.

My feelings,
like my extremities,

are basically numb.

Here's your license.

Now, if you wait over there,

we'll call you
when the officiant's ready.

Do we need a blood test?

No.

Well, then how will you know
whether or not we have syphilis?

I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you don't have that.

Okay, Sheldon, you officially
exceeded the number of times

I hoped to hear the word
"syphilis" on my wedding day.

I can't believe we're doing this.

I know. I'm getting married.

The new Star Wars movie's coming out.

We are really
finishing this year strong.

Okay, but of the two of those...

You know, I'm not even gonna ask.
I'm not gonna ask.

Are you sad we're not
having a big party?

I'm really not.

I'm here with you. It's perfect.

Cooper-Fowler?

<i>You're up.</i>

(SIGHS)

Can you believe it?

We're about to walk in that door,
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler,

and walk out
as a married couple,

Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.

Wait.

I want to have a first dance with you.

Right here?

At our wedding.

But this is our wedding.

No.

I want a real wedding.

Sheldon, it was just making us fight.

I know. But, Amy,

I never thought
I'd want to marry anyone.

So the fact that I found you
is astonishing.

It's like finding dark matter,

except they're looking
for dark matter.

I wasn't even looking for you.

So you're even better
than dark matter.

(CHUCKLES)

Sheldon.

Plus, plus, you interact with light,
so I can see you.

(AMY GASPS)

And, also, you don't account
for the missing mass

-in the universe. And-
- Okay, I think

you're getting caught up on the
ways I'm not like dark matter.

Right. Sorry.

But when you make
a discovery like this,

you don't just take it down
to City Hall,

you tell the whole world.

And, so I'll say it in Latin or Klingon

or smoke signals,

if that's not cultural appropriation.

- It is.
- Okay, so not smoke signals.

But I want to do this right.

Me too.

Let's go plan a wedding.

You know, we did get dressed up

and come all the way
to City Hall.

What are you thinking?

I have always wanted a permit
to dispose of hazardous waste.

Let's do it.

Do we know if there's life in
the methane plumes of Enceladus

or under the icy surface
of Europa?

Come back on Tuesday
for my next show to find out.

Spoiler alert, we don't.

I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

and thank you for taking
a walk with me

through the stars.

(APPLAUSE)

Wow. I never knew science
could be so interesting.

Hey, I talk to you
about science all the time.

Oh, you sure do, sweetie.

Should we go congratulate him?

I'll do better than that.
I'll give him constructive criticism.

Here's some constructive criticism,
don't.

- I'll catch up with you guys.
- Yeah.

Raj, you were terrific!

Thank you. I was so nervous,
my armpits are like a swamp.

Oh. Your hug just got
downgraded to a high five.

(PENNY LAUGHING)
Your palms are sweaty, too.

Hey. What are you doing
all the way in the back?

Hiding out.

I wasn't sure if I was welcome.

This is ridiculous.
You guys are best friends.

Of course he wants you here.

You sure? He seems to be doing
pretty well without me.

Look, he was just stressed out.

His life is not better
without you.

Come on. Come say hi.

Okay.

Dr. Koothrappali, ljust wanted
to tell you that was amazing.

- Counterpoint-
- To the car.

Can I ask you a question?

Of course, you can. That went well.

Ask me another.

I think I'm just gonna go.

If there is life beneath
the surface of these planets,

how would we even detect it?

That's a complicated question.

Let me start with a simpler one.

Can I buy you a coffee?

Also, a complicated question. (GIGGLES)

Because I want to say yes,
but if I drink coffee this late,

then I'll be up all night.

Decaf, genius.

I would love to.

Hi Stuart, two questions.

Do you have the new Aquaman,

and do you mind if I use your
back room to smoke some meat?

Well, since it's you asking,

I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism.

Why are you smoking meat?

And why are you reading Aquaman?

I am trying to make Amy
a historically accurate

<i>Little House on the Prairie
dinner for her birthday, and</i>

I want to be able to say I was
reading it before it was cool.

Wow, well, that's actually really sweet.

The dinner thing.
The Aquaman thing's dumb.

Is-Isn't Halley's birthday
the same as Amy's?

Yeah, but we're not doing
anything big 'cause she's one,

Bernadette's on bed rest, and I'm lazy.

Hell, guys.

- Hello.
- Hey.

Howard.

Raj.

Excuse me.

Really? ls this still happening?

I'm willing to make up,
but someone's being a baby.

(EXCLAIMS)
I do love a riddle. Let me see.

See, my first guess would be Halley,

but that'd be strange to
accuse her of being a baby

'cause she is a baby.

Erm, I suppose it could be Stuart,

his head does have
a certain milky scent.

Although...

It's me, Sheldon.
He's calling me a baby.

No, I don't know. I saw Leonard
put his keys in his mouth today.

You're a grown man. Act like it.

Big talk coming from a guy
holding an Archie comic book.

Hey, werewolf Jughead
is not your dad's Jughead.

Come on, you guys have been
friends forever. Quit fighting.

I have an extra ticket

to the opening of The Last <i>Jedi</i> tonight.

It was gonna be Howard's,
but you can have it.

You two had a good run.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Who wants to go see
Last <i>Jedi</i> again tonight?

- L'm in.
- Me, too.

It'll be nice to see the parts
I missed while I was blinking.

Hey, guys, there's a change of plans.

We are having a party
for Halley's birthday after all.

Turns out Bernadette and "anyone
who's not a heartless monster"

thinks that's the right thing to do.

I don't like kids,
but I do like birthday cake.

No. Wait, will there be
sugary icing flowers on it?

I don't know.

I'll risk it.

But if I have a tantrum and have
to leave early, you'll know why.

Here you go. Here you go.

See you two there.

Are you kidding me?

You're not gonna invite me
to Halley's birthday?

I'm her godfather, that means something.

Or, hear me out on this. It doesn't.

Okay, that's enough.

This fight either has to end
or get way more entertaining.

Don't worry about it 'cause
I'm done putting up with him!

I know you have a lot on your mind,

but when do you think we'll have
an answer on those cake flowers?

- Hey.
- Hey. What you reading?

It's your brother's Christmas letter.

Ugh. If there's a picture
of his wife and his kids

and his clogs and his horses
all in matching pajamas,

I beg you to burn it.

(EXCLAIMS) The people's pajamas
have little horses on them,

and the horses have little people.

It's just his chance to brag
about how great his life is.

Oh, come on, it's nice.

You know that nonprofit he works with?

They built a hospital in Rwanda.

"Look at me.
I built a hospital in Rwanda."

That is a good point.
I hadn't thought of it that way.

- Hello.
- Hey.

So this is for Amy's birthday.
Can I leave it here?

Sure. What is it?

A butter churn.

Ooh. That's what I got her.

It's for her surprise
frontier birthday dinner.

I am making

hardtack, boiled salt pork,

and because it's a special day,
a chewable gob of tree sap.

Is that good?

Compared to other foods, no.

Compared to other parts of a tree?
Meh.

And then after dinner,
we will have birthday coitus.

Do you think that will also
be historically accurate?

I assume like the rest of frontier life,

it'll be exhausting and short.

You're exhausting and short.

Hey, Stuart, you're coming
to Halley's party, right?

You bet.
Plus, I live there and I was invited,

so it's already better
than my 10th birthday party.

- Great. Can you bring a few things?
- Sure. What do you need?

Balloons, streamers,

ice, snacks, a bounce house,
face painter,

and a couple kids whose parents
are willing to lie and say

they know me from the Daddy
and Me class I've never been to.

Where do you and Halley go every week?

The important thing is we're together,

and if the movie gets
too violent, I cover her eyes.

Don't stress about this party.

She's one, she's not gonna remember.

The other day I showed her
her toe, and she was shocked.

It's not for the baby,
it's for Bernadette.

She's feeling guilty

about all the stuff
she's missing with Halley.

All right.

Uncle Stuart's got your back.

Ain't no party like a Stuart party

because Stuart's
never invited to parties.

Did the electricity go out?

I don't know what you mean
by "electricity," ma'am.

lam just a farmer boy living in
a little house on the prairie.

(SQUEALS)

I'm glad you're happy.

I wanted to do something special
for your birthday.

(LAUGHING) You did,
you did! It's perfect!

You do know that my birthday's
tomorrow, right?

This is just step one
of your birthday weekend.

Now, would you care to join me
for an authentic frontier dinner

made entirely from scratch?

(LAUGHS) I can't believe you did this.
It's amazing!

Oh, it's not a big deal.

Just to be clear, it was a big deal.

I was being modest. You got that, right?

- Loud and clear.
- Well, I hope you're hungry.

Oh, I'm starving.

Oh, good. Starvation is authentic
to the time period.

If you also have malaria

and a deep distrust of Native Americans,

we're really cooking with a wood stove.

Is that butter?

Yes. But don't blow it all
on one biscuit.

Took me nine hours to make that.

I think I got churner's elbow.

I know we only have coitus
on my birthday,

but I don't know if I can wait
until midnight.

Well, you'll be glad you did.

Everyone knows the best foreplay

is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.

Hey. What are you doing?

Oh, I've decided to write
my own Christmas letter.

So I'm gonna make a list

of all the cool things we did this year.

Oh! Fun. Can I help?

Yes. Can you think of a single
cool thing we did this year?

<i>Weâ, both of our 'gobs are going great.</i>

Sure. I mean, my Air Force
project got taken away,

and you're not crazy about
selling pharmaceuticals.

I'll just write down "still employed."

Oh!
We had our second anniversary.

Yeah, but we did

kind of forget about it,

so... Maybe just write "still married."

LEONARD: Great. Okay.

Okay, that's a start.

What else?

You know, maybe this is enough.

Let's look at our pictures.
That'll jog our memories.

What is that a picture of?

Oh, that's a mole on my back.

I wanted to make sure
it wasn't growing, so...

How'd you get a picture
of your own back?

Sheldon took it.
We're kind of mole buddies.

Hey, that's a cute picture.

Isn't that the day
we almost went to the beach?

Memorial Day?

No, that was the day we almost
went to the mountains.

Oh.

That's the great thing about California,

you can almost go to the mountains

and almost go to the beach
in the same day.

Yeah.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Look, I'm sorry about
not inviting you

to Halley's birthday.
That wasn't cool.

And of course we would
love to have you. Here.

Thank you.
I'd really like to be there.

Great, 'cause it's tomorrow,
and I need you to plan it.

What?

Stuart was gonna help,

but the free clinic had
an open spot for a colonoscopy,

and he jumped on it.

Wait, so you're just apologizing
because you need something?

Yes, and I think it's pretty
mature of me to admit it.

Well, that's very insulting.

Right again.
Are you gonna help me or not?

No, I will not help you.

But I will help Halley.

She's my goddaughter, and I love her.

And I have a lot of party favors

left over from
Cinnamon's birthday, so...

I hope she likes things that
squeak when you chew on them.

She's a human being, not an animal.

But that actually would be a hit.

Can I get you anything else?

No, thanks. I think I'm good.

You sure?
There's still plenty of pork fat.

Although, if we don't eat it,
I suppose we could turn it into soap.

That might taste better.

I think I'm just gonna go over here
and sit on the couch.

Great. Then we will move on
to stage two,

the pitching of woo.

Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

Should I read you some bawdy
19th century limericks?

(CHUCKLES) Okay.

Oh, here.

"There once was a priest
from Terre Haute

"who purchased a sheep and a goat..."

Hold on a second.

Is it getting hot in here?

Well, I didn't even get
to the dirty part yet.

No, I'm serious.

Do you think there was
something wrong with that food?

Frontier scallops? I shouldn't think so.

My stomach's feeling a little weird.

Yeah. Mine, too.

I'm sure it's just the first
sharp cramps of arousal.

No. This doesn't feel right.

Hey, hey, save that sexy talk
for the bedroom.

You know, if you'll excuse me,

lam just going to go freshen up.

(VOMITING)

Sheldon?

<i>SHELDON: I'll be out in a minute.</i>

I don't have a minute!

(VOMITING)

I can't believe you pulled
this all together overnight.

If I had more time, I could
have gotten the Blue Man Group.

One of them goes to my dry cleaner.

Who, by the way, hates him.

You really saved the day.

Well, it's not for you. It's for Halley.

<i>And I'm sure</i>

she'd appreciate it, if she knew
what's going on or who you are.

Morning.

Happy birthday.

Yeah, sure.

Did you sleep at all?

No. You?

I passed out on the toilet once.

I don't know if that counts.

Feel any better?

I feel terrible.

Well, (SIGHS)

should we make love now?

How can you even think about sex?

Hey, I'm a man,
I have annual needs just like anyone.

And besides,
it's our birthday tradition.

You think you can do it

while I lie perfectly still
and you don't touch me?

I can try.

Want to do it again?

- Morning.
- Morning.

"Kept Fern alive"? Who's Fern?

No, the fern. The one in the bathroom.

We're really calling
that brown thing alive? Okay.

So, how long have you
been working on this?

(SIGHS) Couple of hours.

I took a break to try to beat
my high score on Mario Kart.

Well, did you do it?

Do you see it on the board?

Okay, this is silly.
Our lives are great.

I think so, too.

So then why is this bugging you so much?

I guess it feels like everyone's
moving forward, and we're stuck.

What do you mean?

Well, we've been married two years.
Should we think about what's next?

Like buying a house or having a baby?

Look, I want to do
all those things someday,

but there's a bunch of stuff
I want to do first.

Okay, like what?

I don't know, stay thin and have money.

No, no, I'm serious.

If there's things we want to do,
let's start doing them.

Okay. Well, we've never been
on a big trip together.

I would love that.

Okay, there's something for your letter.

"Considered going on a trip."

It's just a day trip,

but we could take the ferry
out to Catalina.

Great, let's do it.

Amy's in the bathroom and I need to...

(SHELDON VOMITING)

It's like I can hear the ocean already.

Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

Hey, What's going on?

Bernadette's sister's kids are sick
and they're not coming.

But they're the whole reason
the cupcakes are vegan!

<i>- BERNADETTE: How's the party coming?
- Good!</i>

Great! Our friends
should be here any second!

Those are the only
other people you invited?

What about the kids
from the Daddy and Me class?

Grow up.

- Uh-oh.
- What?

I left the food out.

You afraid it's gonna go good?

How are you feeling?

My stomach aches, I got the chills,

my mouth tastes weird,

it hurts to swallow,
and I've got a little double vision.

Yeah.

I'm feeling better, too.

- Well, this party's a disaster.
- Don't blame the party!

You know how many favors
I had to call in

with my bounce house guy
to get Wonder Woman?

Is that Wonder Woman?

Technically,
it's a Chinese knockoff called

Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.

Then I take it back, it's a great party.

Well, you can sit here
and sulk if you want.

I'm gonna go celebrate
Halley's first birthday.

Which I planned with no help from you.

What are you doing?

It's a bounce house!
I'm gonna go bounce in it!

You're supposed to take your shoes off

before you go in there!

You know what?

I'm stressed about
my daughter's birthday party.

I don't need your attitude.

Well, I worked really hard on this,

and you haven't even said thank you.

I'm sorry. Thank you.

Thank you for blaming me

for everything
that's wrong in your life!

Thank you for walking out
on our friendship!

You are welcome!

And thank you for mocking me
for all of these years!

Thank you for making it so easy!

Why are you being such a jerk?

Because you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings!

Well, you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings!

I can't believe you shoved me!

Well, I can't believe you shoved me!

But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?

- It was! Do it again!
- Gladly!

Okay, now at the same time!

(BOTH LAUGHING) That was awesome!

Yeah, okay, this time, knees, then feet.

One, two, three.

Again! Again!

Hello.

- Hi.
- You made it.

How you two feeling?

Oh, a little better.

Those books should have been called

<i>Little Outhouse on the Prairie.</i>

<i>BERNADETTE: Halley's awake
and ready for her party!</i>

Be right up!

- I want to see the birthday girl.
- I'd love to see her.

<i>BERNADETTE: Walk slow, it takes a while
to put this bra back on!</i>

You know,

it's still your birthday.

It is.

And we are both feeling better.

We are.

And there's no one in that bounce house.

No.

Great.

Let's go jump for a bit,

and then find a bedroom
to have coitus in.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Hey, can you do me a favor?

Can we try to avoid talking to
our friends tonight

about our wedding plans?

I'll do you one better.

I'll avoid talking
to our friends entirely

and play on my phone.

It's just, I haven't picked
a maid of honor yet,

and I'm having trouble deciding
between Penny and Bernadette.

Ah. Understandable.
They are quite similar.

Both blonde former waitresses
who married beneath them.

Penny is my best friend,

but I was Bernadette's
maid of honor,

and I think
she kind of expects it.

So, if anyone brings
it up tonight,

just maybe you can help
me change the subject.

How about this?
I dominate the conversation so hard,

no one has a chance
to get a word in edgewise.

I don't know.
They might see that coming.

What if we have a code word?

Now you're speaking my catamaran.

That's my code word for "language."

Okay, fine, catamaran.
That's our code word.

No, that's my code word.
Get your own.

Okay. Pretzels.

You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.

Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.

What?

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we started.

Hey, just hold the gate
still while I screw it in.

You know, I don't know how I feel
about all this baby-proofing.

If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down the stairs,

then maybe that's nature's way
of saying

the Wolowitz line ends here.

That's funny.
I always thought

Howard was nature's way of saying

the Wolowitz line ends here.

Me, too, but life does
find a way!

Hey, Halley can't reach
the liquor cabinet.

Why did you baby-proof it?

How did you know we did?

Fair point.

- Bernadette still going stir-crazy?
- A little.

Two months of bed rest,
it's been rough.

Really? That sounds great.
How do I get that?

You'd either have to break your
hip or let Howard knock you up.

Now, either way, you'll get
flowers the next morning.

She's actually been
keeping herself busy

doing wedding research for you.

Oh! She doesn't have to do that.

She wants to. After all,
you were her maid of honor.

Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.

Oh. Right. Yeah, yeah.

Did you know that we've been thinking

of having pretzels
at our wedding?

No, no. I'm sorry.

No, rhinos. We're having
rhinos at our wedding.

No! I got to go.

I'm gonna need some help.
Someone baby-proofed the front door.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?

I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.

She even folded down the pages
with the good dresses.

I get it.
You know, Leonard

once borrowed
my Edmund Scientific catalog

and dog-eared some pages.

Never got 'em straight again.

Well, that is exactly the same thing.

You really understand my dilemma.

Actually, I do.
My mother

is pushing for my brother, Georgie,
to be my best man,

and I hate to disappoint her again.

I already rejected her savior
and her Linkedln invitation.

How are we gonna make these decisions

without anybody getting upset?

Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process,

and base it on empirical metrics?

Then we aren't really
making the decision,

the data is.

So we can hurt our friends' feelings

without taking any responsibility?

Me likey.

But how do we apply
quantitative metrics

to something as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?

That decision only seems subjective.

In reality,

people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions,

and some will perform those
better than others.

If I may use a superhero analogy-

- You may not.
- Okay, I'll use real people.

Um, if a certain dog-like loyalty
is useful,

then it's Leonard.
If having a PEZ dispenser

filled with TUMS is
an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.

If a best man
with fake testicles hanging

from his truck is important,

well, then, my brother's
back in the running.

Okay, I see your point.

So, we break down
each of the roles

into their component parts,

and then design
specialized tests for each.

Exactly. Boy, if I had known
getting married was going to

involve so much science,
I'd have proposed years ago.

So Leonard, tell everyone your news.

I'm starting a book.

That would be big news from Penny,

but you've read a book before.

He means he's writing a book.

I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist

who solves crimes using science.

- Oh, Leonard-
- It's not about you.

He probably has to say that
for legal reasons.

HOWARD: Uh-oh.

They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.

Well, no fair!
I SoulCycled this morning.

I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.

Well, I would say that this
constitutes a catering crisis.

I agree. Who's gonna
step up and handle it?

Doesn't matter. This is fine.

(INAUDIBLE)

Penny?

What?

You know what?
I'll take care of it.

Done.

You didn't make him
feel bad, did you?

Actually, he was laughing.

I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.

Please. I've been sending food
back my entire life.

One of my first
full sentences was,

"I had breast milk for breakfast."

Excuse me,
before we start eating,

I would like to make a toast.

- Nice.
- Nice.

If only I could think of one.

Someone else go.

Hey. Here's the sewing kit
you asked for.

Oh, a minute 19.

Quick.

You were timing me?

Yes. I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.

How long will it last?

We'll find out.

What did you need the kit for?

Oh, er...

Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork

and he ripped his pants.

Someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.

(DOOR SHUTS)

Quick thinking.

But for future lies,

this is as far as I can squat.

Penny gets 20 points
for the sewing kit.

Yeah, minus five,

because this is mine.

Well, she's still pulling
a commanding lead.

Did Bernadette even try
to send us a sewing kit?

She did.
Amazon, standard shipping,

not even Prime.

We could've done that ourselves.

(SCOFFS) That's what she said.

Maybe we're being old-fashioned,

defining these roles by gender.

You know, historically,
the best man's role

was to defend the bride
and groom in combat.

I mean, if that's not Penny,
I don't know what we're doing here.

I see your point.

Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman

and a gentleman of honor.

Oh! Those names are terrible.
One point off for you.

What am I being tested for?

Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass,

none of this matters.

Okay, what's the next test?

Loyalty.

We need to choose
someone who has our backs,

someone who will keep our
secrets even from each other.

Well, I don't have any secrets
from you.

Do you have secrets from me?

Yes.

Oh, that has been weighing
on me for years.

Come here.

Would you call yourself
a loyal and trustworthy friend?

- Yeah, I like to think so.
- Great.

Because I need to tell you
something about Howard,

but you can't tell him
that I told you.

Nope. Don't want to hear it.

Do not like to engage in gossip.

Okay. I respect your integrity.

Is it about his special underwear?

Because I already know.
And that's all I'll say.

Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.

It's really sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.

Agreed.

So listen, I have a secret

<i>that I need to tell someone.</i>

But you can never say a word.

Not even to Howard.

I'm your girl. Lay it on me.

Really?
You keep things from your husband?

No, I tell him everything.

Don't be a child.

Okay. Here it is.

I can control the thermostat

in Leonard's apartment with my phone.

And when he makes me mad,

I turn it up, slightly.

Oh. Hey. I didn't know you were here.

What are you two talking about?

Literally, nothing interesting.

Oh, you're good.

Okay, getting to
the ceremony on time.

Leonard, quick.
I need you to get me

to Arcadia within the hour.

The train store's having a sale.

Why can't Amy drive you?

Because of the tradition
that I cannot see Amy

on the day of the train store sale.

Please, please see a doctor.

- Next test.
- Just wait one second.

Is it getting hot in here?

(CHUCKLING)

I'm sorry. Where were we?

How well do our friends know us?

So I was talking to my favorite aunt-

Aunt Doe, right?

Exactly.

Did she ever figure out what
that thing on her knee was?

Turns out it was a chocolate chip.

Mmm, makes sense, she does like to bake.

AMY: Yes, she does. Damn,
you are a thoroughbred.

You know, dealing with cold feet

is an important part of being
both best man and maid of honor.

Maybe we should test for that ability.

You really think
you might get cold feet?

Actually, I was talking about you.

Amy.

If there's one thing in
this world I'm sure of,

you are right to be worried.

Goodnight.

Howard, I've had my eye
on this limited edition Swamp Thing,

but now that I'm
about to buy it,

I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?

I don't know, Sheldon,
it's pretty expensive.

Yes, but what if it will
make me happy, you know,

waking up and seeing it every
morning for the rest of my life?

(CHUCKLING)
Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?

Yeah, well, Bernadette's
no prize either!

Hey, what you doing?

Er, Sheldon gave me a brain-teaser.
It's kind of fun.

It's about a group of people at dinner,

and you have to figure out where
they can sit without fighting.

Yeah, is this
the one where Mr. Green

can't sit next to anyone eating meat,

and Uncle Light Blue

won't sit next to any
of the darker colors?

Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?

Amy did.
I solved it already.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Same way I solved
my jury duty summons,

I threw it away.

No, no, no, no, no.

Aunt Orange can't sit next to the bar

without Ms. Pink saying,

"Jesus thinks you've
had enough whiskey."

Did Sheldon and Amy give
you guys that puzzle, too?

Yeah. ls it just me or
have they been acting strange?

I don't think they're acting.

Yeah, the other clay,
Sheldon made me

take him to the train store.

We didn't go inside.
He just said,

"Nicely done,"
and then we went home.

Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring

and told me to hold on to it.

I got one, too.

- Yeah, same.
- Yeah, me, too.

But Cinnamon ate it.

I'll get it back tomorrow.

I have to say,
this is going pretty well.

It is.

If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong,

then I don't want
to be morally right.

Hey, are you testing us

to see who gets to be in your wedding?

- Yes.
- No.

They're rating us.

And I'm in last?

Don't panic, there's still time.

Look, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

You know what, this is so insulting.

I don't even want to be
your stupid best man.

- Yeah.
- Me neither.

Wait, wait.

Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?

I did.

Impressive.

Hello, Stuart.

Hey, Sheldon.
Can I interest you in a cappuccino?

When did you start selling those?

Someone left it here,
but it's still warm.

Want to say four bucks?

No, thank you.

Everything okay?

Well, I secretly
experimented on my friends,

and now none of them
want to be my best man.

So, you know,
normal wedding drama.

Sorry.

Probably have to use
my stupid brother.

So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.

Well, if you really don't
want to use your brother,

I'd be your best man.

- Really?
- Yeah, we're friends.

Plus, it'd be nice.

Never really been called
the best before.

Or a man, for that matter.

Okay, well, thank you, Stuart.

That's a very generous offer.

My pleasure.

I understand

the best man usually
receives a present.

That's true.

Can never have
too much Claritin.

You're still working on
Sheldon's dumb brain-teaser?

Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's
a woman! Of course!

Oh, that feels so good.

Hello.

I believe I owe the
three of you an apology.

No argument here.

By experimenting on you,

I realize I've violated your trust

and possibly the Geneva Convention.

Is that it?

No.

So as to not upset
any of you further,

I've asked Stuart
to be my best man,

and he's agreed.

Now, you're all still invited
to the bachelor party.

He's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.

You picked Stuart over one of us?

Well, I wanted to choose one of you,

but you all turned against me.

Picking a best man isn't
about keeping score.

But you're all my friends.

I mean, if I didn't collect data,

how could I possibly choose
among the three of you?

Well, that's actually kind of sweet.

Is it?
Then perhaps I said it wrong.

Look, this is your wedding,
just pick whoever you want.

You don't need to worry
about anyone else but yourself.

You've kind of been training
for this your whole life.

Thank you, Leonard.

And if it helps,
these two are quitters.

Hey, what you making?

Er. Well, I spilled the cheese packet,

-so we're having mac and nothing.
-(LEONARD SIGHS)

Yeah. I'll just have the mac.
"Nothing" gives me gas.

Why are you in such a good mood?

I just talked to Sheldon.

He apologized about the tests
and asked me to be his best man.

Great. After all you've done
for him, he should've asked you.

And Amy's your best friend.

I'm sure she'll come
to her senses and pick you.

Okay, she's not my best friend.
We're not 12.

If she wants Bernadette
to be her maid of honor,

I really don't care.

Sounds like you care.

No, I mean, it's just annoying.

You know, we talk every day.
We see each other all the time.

She's always there
for me, and basically...

Oh, my God,
Amy's my best friend.

You Okay?

No, my best friend didn't ask me
to be her maid of honor.

I'm pissed!

So, bottom line,
what you did was wrong and cruel,

which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.

So she still wants
to be my maid of honor?

Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need.

Make the call.

Look, I know this is your wedding,

and you can do whatever you want,

but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor,

then you're an idiot because
you are my best friend.

- Too late. Bernadette...
- Bestie!

Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird

Sheldon made me best man
instead of you.

It's okay.
I was best man for two whole days.

No one can take that away from me.

Except for Sheldon, when he did.

Although, if you want to be
a part of the wedding party,

I suppose you could be the flower girl.

Sold.

Well, I thought Halley
was gonna be the flower girl.

Oh. That's much better.
Sorry, Stuart, you're out.

Hey, so is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?

Actually, I haven't
had the courage to tell her.

- I guess I should do that.
- Yeah.

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

Although, as maid of honor,

your job is to make my life easier.

(SIGHS)

Damn it.

Hey, Stuart, you still
want in on this wedding?

Not that much.

(SIGHS) Fine, I'll do it.

But do me a favor and unlock
the liquor cabinet first.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Hey! Look what I got everybody.

Newspapers?

Did you find a portal back
to the 1990s?

No. If he had that,
he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC

from breaking up.

Oh, please. I'm glad they broke up.

Otherwise, Justin would
never have brought sexy back.

One thing you can't get
on an iPad,

the smell of ink and paper.

One more reason
iPads are better.

They reviewed
my planetarium show.

Yeah. It's on page three
of the Arts and Leisure section.

Oh, look, they still have Far Side.

I don't get that one.

Oh. He's pushing
when he should be pulling.

I don't think he belongs
in that gifted school, then.

- What are you doing?
- Making a boat.

When I was a kid,
my dad showed me how.

Boy, you'll do anything
to avoid reading.

Guys, it's under
"Things to do this weekend."

I can't find it.
What does it say?

That it's a thing
to do this weekend.

Well, that's great, Raj.
Congratulations.

<i>You know,</i> while <i>we're bragging,
The Journal of Prosthetic Medicine</i>

just wrote up the project that
Howard and I are working on.

Well, you didn't tell me that.

Oh, it just came out.
It's just a little blurb.

Oh. Well, good for you.

You know, Bert and I have
started isolating zircons

from meteorites
for our dark matter search.

(SHELDON EXCLAIMS)

Oh! Well, how nice.

Everyone's doing impressive work.

What have you been
working on these days?

Ooh, where'd that come from?

Where did what come from?

I try to be supportive,

and you break out the hot lights
and the rubber hose.

I just asked
what you've been working on.

Oh, my God, let it go.

Can you believe this guy?

I did it!

See? It's a boat.

It's also a hat.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, how do you want
to play this?

Do you want to pretend like
nothing's bothering you

and blow up later,
or do you just want to be

a maniac right now?

Nothing is bothering me.

Fine. Be that way.

If you want to talk,
I'll be flushing my sinuses.

Wait.

I have a confession.

When I berated Leonard,

it was a clever ruse
to conceal the fact

that I'm not
working on anything.

Well, I think I speak for everyone

when I say, "No!"

The truth is I have
nothing of interest to pursue.

Well, maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

to take some time
for yourself and refocus.

I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.

Thank you, Amy.

I don't know what I'd do
without you.

Hey, can I stay here?
Sheldon kicked me out.

Well, is everything okay?

Yeah. He just wants
some alone time to work.

Fine. Make yourself at home.

Yeah. We were just about
to watch a little TV.

- You're welcome to join us.
- Thanks. I'll be right with you.

ljust have to do my neti pot.

So what are you guys gonna watch?

Okay.

Hey, what do you think
we should open our show with?

<i>Thor and Doctor Jones
or Let's Get Astrophysical?</i>

I think we should
start with something

that gets them up on their feet.

<i>Maybe Sherlock Around the Clock.</i>

Great, yeah.
Let's give it a try.

<i>BERNADETTE:
Halley's napping! Keep it down!</i>

Right. Sorry.

It's cool.
We don't need volume to rock.

Instead of blowing
the roof off this place,

we can gently lift it off

and set it quietly down
in the backyard.

Okay. One, two, three, four.

(SINGING)

<i>Holmes said to Watson</i>

<i>On Baker Street</i>

<i>Come on Doctor</i>

<i>Time to move them feet</i>

Sing it with us!

<i>Sherlock Sherlock</i>

<i>Sherlock around the clock</i>

We can't hear you.

<i>Sherlock Sherlock</i>

<i>Sherlock around the clock</i>

(HALLEY CRYING)

BERNADETTE:
<i>Nice going.</i>

Sorry. Sorry. I'll get her.

(HALLEY CRYING)

One sec.

<i>BERNADETTE:
You bought diapers, right?</i>

Be right back.

Rock and roll!

Okay. Scratch paper, check.

Whiteboard, check.

Chex Mix, check.

And here we go.

(PHONE RINGING)

Dang it.

Hello, Mother.

Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe

who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.

lam right in the middle
of some very important work.

I don't have time for this
right now.

Then why did you
answer the phone?

Because you raised me
to be polite.

Now stop bothering me.

Hello again.

Who did you see
at the barbecue festival?

Mr. Watkins.

Yeah. Really?

You called me and interrupted
my work to tell me

that you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?

I'm sorry, Mother,
I really need to focus here.

I will speak to you next week.

Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you then.

I thought Mr. Watkins
moved to Florida.

He did.
He was back visiting his son.

Oh, gosh darn it,
that is interesting.

Was it Tommy or Joe?

I bet it was Joe, 'cause
he and Tommy had a falling out

over that time-share.

You guys do anything fun after dinner?

Well, actually Amy came
back over and we hung out.

Did you know that we're both
spelling bee champs?

We stayed up for hours
trying to stump each other.

Who won?

She thought she had me
with "appoggiatura,"

but I shut that down expeditiously.

<i>E-X-P-E-D-l-T-l-0-U-S-L-Y.
Expeditiously.</i>

Wow. I bet that made Penny
take off all of her clothes.

Put her pajamas on and
then go to bed early.

- Yeah, at like, 9:00.
- Yeah.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Oh, are we still on
for band practice this evening?

Oh, shoot.

I promised I would take Halley
over to Bernadette's parents.

Dude, the gig is,
like, next weekend.

I know. I'm sorry.
I really want to do this,

but I just don't think
I have the time.

Okay. I guess I'll have to cancel.

Toby Greenbaum will have to
become a man without us.

Too bad, you guys kill at bar mitzvahs.

And other events that
people can't leave.

I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.

You know, maybe you should

think about replacing me.

<i>- Okay.
- I mean...</i>

I know it'll be hard since we-

I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.

I'm gonna go ask him.

I guess he forgot that
I play the cello.

I don't think he did.

Okay, I think it's ready.

Should we put on safety goggles?

Well, the funnest fun
is the safest fun, so yes.

Hey.

- Hi.
- Hello.

Amy, you're here, again.

Yeah, Sheldon said he needed
another night to work,

so I said I'd give him some space.

So what's all this?

Well, Amy and I were talking
about old science fair projects

and how fun it would be
to recreate them.

We're making hot ice.

It's pretty cool.

- Nice one.
- Yeah.

Turns out we both

did this as our science fair
projects in ninth grade.

Do you remember any of
your high school projects?

Uh... Well,
I remember telling Jenny Runyon

that I would teach her
how to flirt with boys

if she put my name on her project.

I got an "A," she got pregnant.

Girls like you are why I had to
come straight home after school.

Check this out.

PENNY: Look <i>at</i> that.

<i>Wow, that's amazing.</i>

<i>LEONARD: Mmm-hmm. The crystallization is
an exothermic process,</i>

<i>so the ice is actually hot.</i>

-I won first place for this.
- So did I.

I threw Jenny's baby shower.

Oh. Hey, in seventh grade,

I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?

Oh. We can come up with
a wave speed formula,

and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.

Wow, I didn't think
anything could top

last night's spelling bee,
but here comes math.

I'm sorry, we don't
have to do more experiments.

Let's do something we can all enjoy.

Hey, you want to watch
that show you like

where people want to buy a house
and then they do?

No, no, you guys do your experiments.
I'll go pick up dinner.

- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you're having science fun,

and I don't want to interfere,
or watch you.

Did I actually do it?

(EXCLAIMS) I did. I did.

The answer is one in 18 million.

What is?

The odds of you
running into Mr. Watkins.

Oh, Shelly. I have bad news.

Mr. Watkins passed this morning.

Oh!

I'm sorry.

I know. What are the odds of that?

Call you back.

<i>LEONARD:
Now, let's calculate the amplitude!</i>

<i>ANN:
All right!</i>

Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?

It's annoying when you do it.

I brought pizza.

Oh, thank you.

I have been working pretty hard.

I could use a break.

What's that?

Yeah, that is an experiment

to see how many parallelograms
I could draw

while holding my breath.

Is that where you blacked out?

No, actually,

that's where I blacked out.

And this?

That is a list

of all the different types
of natural disasters.

"Fire-quake"?

I made that one up.

Which I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.

Hey, I thought you were
working on actual science.

<i>I am.</i>

I'm trying to come up with
a new approach to dark matter,

but people keep distracting me.

First, my mother kept answering
the phone when I called,

even though she knew
I was busy.

And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food.

A circle made of triangles
served in a square box.

Maybe I'll just eat this
in the laundry room.

No, no. Wait.

You don't have to go, as long as you
sit quietly and don't say anything.

Fine.

Mmm.

Good.

Are you mocking me?

Hey, you want to hear
one of my geology songs?

So it's about rocks?

Better. It's about a boulder.

Isn't that the same thing?

Far from it.

A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.

Is that fact in the song?

No.

Yes.

It's sung from the viewpoint
of the boulder

that chases Indiana Jones.

That's right up our alley.
Let's hear it.

Okay.

(SINGING)

<i>Alone in my temple
in the middle of Peru</i>

<i>A giant stone ball
with nothing much to do</i>

<i>But if you steal my idol</i>

<i>I will roll right over you</i>

<i>'Cause I'm six tons of
granite and Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah, I'm six tons of granite
and Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

So, I think if we want

to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use

elasticity theory and model the lattice

as one continuous flexible piece.

This is fun.

Playing with Popsicle sticks,

exploring ways
to store kinetic energy.

It's like preschool all over again.

Except now if I eat paste,
it's because I want to,

not because
Craig Schultz is making me.

Hey, can I ask you a question?

Is it, "Where was the teacher?"

She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.

It wasn't, but I'm glad
to see you've moved on.

I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.

Oh.

Not really.

Sorry. That probably wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

No, actually it is.

I mean, Sheldon and I are in
a really great place right now,

and ljust, I don't want
anything to mess that up.

Mmm-hmm. You do remember you're here

because he kicked you
out of your apartment?

Yes.

His work is important to him.

It's one of the things I find
the sexiest about him.

Well, that and-

His butt.

And then, I was thinking about

inventing a new
dark matter particle

to evade the omega
baryon constraints,

but that just seems like something

anyone could come up with.

Hmm. Agreed. (CLEARS THROAT)

You know what's blowing my mind?

Somebody thought about
putting cheese in this crust.

ljust wish I could find
something that excites me.

You do understand that
crust doesn't normally

come with cheese in it?

Okay, all right, look.

What got you excited about
dark matter in the first place?

Well, I left string theory,

which I'd been working
on for a long time,

and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was,

and I thought, "Well, sure,
I'll give that a whirl."

So it's your rebound science?

What's that?

Well, not the science you spend
the rest of your life with,

but the one you use to make
yourself feel pretty again.

Well, if I'm being honest,

I never forgot about string theory.

I mean, it's remarkable.

It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything,

something even Einstein
couldn't figure out.

Well, if he couldn't figure
it out, maybe it's just wrong.

But it's so elegant.

I mean, look, string theory posits

that the fundamental particles
we see in three dimensions

are actually strings embedded
in multidimensional space-time.

Interesting.

So that would mean,

that...

Can't do this by myself, buddy.

What is happening?

I was trying not to wake you.

Did it work?

Sorry.

ljust realized,

now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.

You know? Go solo.

You said you were
taking a break from the band

to help with me and the baby.

Yes, and write an astronaut musical.

Picture this.
The curtain opens.

There's a lone astronaut floating
in the inky blackness of space.

Maybe wires,
maybe fog.

I'll let the director figure that out.

(SINGING)

<i>I really don't know when</i>

<i>I'll run out of oxygen</i>

Good news! I'm back in the band!

So Bernadette doesn't mind?

It was her idea!

So it's sort of like a guitar string,

but instead of making an actual sound,

each vibration is a different particle.

Precisely. And when
you express it in 11 dimensions,

Einstein's relativity equations pop out.

Does that sound like a coincidence?

- It does not.
- Yep.

That's what I think.

So, did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?

Oh!

I appreciate your enthusiasm,

but this is not the sort of thing

we can figure out in a night.

People have been
stuck on this for decades.

What, decades? Really?

It's a string.
How hard can it be?

It's straight, it's in a loop,

it gets knotted up
with other strings.

Well, actually there are no knots

in anything greater
than four dimensions.

(STUTTERS) Unless

we get around that
by considering them as sheets.

You know, topologically speaking,

that has
a lot of interesting possibilities.

See? How long did that take me,
like a minute?

Thought you were getting us dinner.

Sorry.
I had to stop at Sheldon's

and help him solve string theory.

What?

Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.

That's cute,
but you can't have knots

in more than four dimensions.

Mmm. You can
if you consider them sheets.

Good night.

<i>What up,
my Hebrews and She-brews?</i>

<i>We are Footprints on the Moon.</i>

<i>Toby, today you are a man,</i>

<i>and you will face
many obstacles in life.</i>

<i>And some of those obstacles
are gonna feel like boulders.</i>

<i>This first song is about
the greatest boulder</i>

<i>in the history of cinema.</i>

One, two, three.

(SINGING)

<i>Alone in my temple
in the middle of Peru</i>

<i>A giant stone ball
with nothing to do</i>

<i>But if you steal my idol</i>

<i>I will roll right over you</i>

<i>'Cause I'm six tons of granite</i>

<i>And Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite</i>

<i>And Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>I'm gonna crush you
I'm gonna mush you</i>

<i>You took my idol
I'm homicidal</i>

<i>Gonna roll over you
till your brains come out</i>

<i>And your bones will crunch
and your blood will spout</i>

I'm not just a rock, baby
I'm a boulder.

(SCREAMS)

<i>'Cause I'm six tons of granite</i>

<i>And Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite</i>

<i>And Micaceous Schist</i>

<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

<i>RAJ: Space is the mirror of the soul.</i>

<i>Are we looking beyond,
or are we looking within?</i>

(EXHALES) I'm looking at my shoes.

This is making me a
little motion sick.

<i>When we gaze out
at the immensities of space,</i>

<i>we understand them
because there are immensities</i>

<i>within us as well.</i>

<i>I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,</i>

<i>and thank you
for taking a walk with me</i>

<i>through the stars.</i>

That pause gets
longer every show.

I believe

you're right.

Hey. Can I get a picture with you?

Absolutely.

And if you post it on social media,

I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet."

Thank you.
The show was great.

Well, I can't take all the credit.

I have pretty good co-stars.

The stars.

Do you say that to everyone?

Only to beautiful women.

And okay women.

Okay.

Just to clarify,
you're the first kind.

Okay.

Mmm.

Thanks for coming. What did you handsome
gentlemen think of the show?

You can turn it off now.

It's sweet of you to say,
but I don't think I can.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.

(LAUGHS) That's great.

Want me to send it to you?

No, on your phone it's cute,
on my phone it's a crime.

I also have
a pretty cute picture to share.

What is that?

An equation.

Isn't it perfect?

Sometimes ljust stare at it,

and I think, "I can't believe
that came out of me."

Well, since we're sharing pictures,

I have one to contribute.

Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.

It's not.

But don't swipe.

What are we looking at here?

Well, that's me and a beautiful woman

and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.

So, state's exhibit "A"?

No. I met her at
the planetarium a few days ago,

and she invited me out for a drink.

Oh. Good for you.
And what's the Hindi word for "dog"?

<i>- A kutta .
- You kutta.</i>

<i>Bow-bow.</i>

That's Hindi for woof-woof.

I am seeing her again tonight.

You know, I also have a date tonight.

But don't worry,
it's not another woman.

It's string theory.

<i>Bow-bow.</i>

Sorry, he's a kutta, you're not.

- Hi.
- Hello.

What you doing?

Taking another picture with my baby.

Look how big he got.

It's fun to see you this excited.

Thank you, that's so--

- Don't sit there!
- What, what?

Sorry. It's part
of my organization system.

That's where those papers go.

Okay. How about if I just

slide this notebook--

(EXCLAIMS)

You know what, it's fine.
I'll just be in the bedroom.

No, no. This is your apartment, too.

Look, I'll stop for the night

and clean this up.

Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.

I know.

See, I'm trying this new technique

where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.

You mean empathy?

Aw, I thought I came up with it.

Well, regardless,
I appreciate the effort.

Thank you.
It's really hard.

- Morning.
- Good morning.

Aw, you didn't have
to cook me breakfast.

Well, I wasn't sure
how I did last night,

and I wanted to finish strong.

You don't need to worry.

Last night was great.

Ah, well, you say that now,

but wait until you taste this.

Oh, my God, this is amazing.

Which is why I keep an omelet
pan in the trunk of my car.

Well, thank you,
it's delicious.

My husband never cooked for me.

Oh. You were married.

Yeah. Well, technically,
I guess I still am.

Is that "technically,"

like, the paperwork hasn't gone through,

or "technically,"

like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?

No, no, we're separated.

Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

Of course.

You know, my secret to
making great omelets is that

I beat the egg whites separately.

Speaking of which,
how long have you been separated?

About two weeks.

That is not a lot of weeks.

In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural "weeks."

Doesn't matter.
He moved out, I moved on.

Good.

Yeah, do you mind me asking
what he does for a living?

He's a firefighter.

Interesting.

A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.

(LAUGHS) It's okay, though.

He's almost had two weeks to cool down.

Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

Oh, I know this one. We're actually
pushing it really hard.

It treats mild dermatitis.

Correct. And who can it
be prescribed to?

Adults and children
who have absolutely, for sure,

stopped growing.

Right again.
And what are the side effects?

Oh. Shoot, shoot.

Remember the mnemonic.

Gravy. Yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

Okay, gastric distress,
redness, anal leakage,

vasculitis and yellow eyes.

So close.

- It's actually yellow discharge.
- Oh. Right.

That's why we went with "gravy."

Hello.

- Hey.
- Hi.

He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?

Maybe he's experiencing
memory loss because he took...

- Flaxitrite.
- Yeah.

- Thank you.
- Sheldon, what are you doing?

Oh, I was just checking in
on my old room

to see what you've done with it.

Why?

Well, I could use a place
to work in the evenings--

- No.
- Well, it's just that

there's not a lot of space in our

-apartment--
- No.

Well, and I feel like

- Amy's been having--
- No.

- And since you're not--
- No.

- It's--
- No.

No.

That is our room now,
and we're gonna turn it into a gym.

Do you really expect me
to believe that?

- No.
- No.

So I guess what's bugging me

is that they only broke up
13 days ago,

and now I'm dating her.

So, am I, like,
the good guy in my movie,

or the bad guy in their movie?

Pretty sure you're
the weird friend in our movie.

(SIGHS) I like her, okay?

ljust, I don't know how I feel about
being the third wheel in a relationship.

Says the guy in my bed with my wife.

Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?

He's apparently not happy
about the breakup,

and based on the sweatpants
he left at her place,

he's like, a medium to large man.

Maybe those are
his "after the holiday" pants,

like you have.

I don't know. I mean, do you think
it's too soon for her to be dating?

If you and Bernadette broke up,

like, how long would you wait?

- Well, I don't even want to think--
- Eight days.

What?

Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.

First of all, you already look amazing.

Aw, that's sweet.

I'm gonna give him
an extra day of crying.

The answer is still no.

You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.

Because you'd be here!

So, who was that?

I can't believe you hung up on me!

What the hell?
What are you doing here?

lam proving you wrong.

I've been working
back there for hours.

You had no idea.

(STUTTERS) Do something.

What the hell?
What are you doing here?

I am trying to respect Amy.

Okay, look, you have an office at work.
Why don't you go there?

I can't go to the office
every time I have a brilliant thought.

I'd basically be living there.

Sounds good, do that.

No. No, the campus
isn't safe at night.

There's raccoons and
undergrads just walking around

like they own the place.

Look. I need somewhere
to work in the evenings.

You have a space you aren't using.

Just take a look at my proposal.

(SIGHS)

- What is this?
- A rental agreement.

I will only use the room for work.

I won't sleep here,
I won't eat your food,

I won't even use your bathroom.

So you can just walk in any
time of the day or night?

Well, he does that now.

At least this way we'll get paid.

<i>I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,</i>

<i>and thank you
for taking a walk with me</i>

<i>through the stars.</i>

I think that one was too long.

Yeah, you're right.
I totally felt it.

Should we run it again?

Please, God, no.

- Hey
- Hey

Can I help you?

Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?

Really? You're not sure

which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?

I am. I was just trying
not to be racist.

I'm Nell's husband.

(STAMMERS)
Here's the thing, I didn't know

that she was married until after--

After what?

I'm really sorry.

Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

What would make you feel better?

I want you to stop seeing my wife.

Done.
Nice to meet you. Bye.

What am I gonna do?

(SOBBING)

(INAUDIBLE)

Hey, buddy, do you want to talk?

I thought we were gonna start a family.

Next thing I know, it's over.

It's gonna be okay.

How is it gonna be okay?

You're sleeping with my wife.

I mean, besides that.

Can I get you anything?

A glass of water?

A laser show?

- No, thank you.
- Good.

'Cause I don't even know
how to turn it on.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have come here.

I guess ljust wanted to see
who she replaced me with.

Don't say that.

What you two had was special.

No one can replace you.

- Did she say that?
- No.

- I should go, right?
- Stay.

Okay, I'll call you later.

Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I barely know her.

And she had sex with you?

Nell tells me you're a fireman.
What's that like?

Okay, I'm really uncomfortable
with him back in that room.

Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.

You don't get it.
All the years that we lived together,

he drove me crazy the whole time.

And now he's not.

Exactly.

Don't look at me like that.

It means he did it on purpose.

It was a choice.

That's like finding out
Godzilla could've had Arby's

instead of Tokyo.

I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.

Not my point.

Sheldon.

Sheldon!

I'm sorry. Am I being too loud?

No, you're being perfect
and you know it.

Would you like me to be a
less considerate tenant?

No. Yes. What--

Stop messing with me!

Hey, I was wrong.
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

He was best friends
with her older brother,

but he didn't even notice her.

And then years afterward,

they randomly bumped into
each other at the DMV.

Two hours later,
they were in love.

You can really see the sparkle
in his license photo.

He told you all this at the planetarium?

No, no, we went to House of Pies.

He got banana cream.
I got coconut.

We did halfsies.

You did pie halfsies with another man?
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

You mean other than you?

Yeah.

I feel bad for him, Bernie.
He's a good guy.

Well, if you're uncomfortable with it,
maybe stop sleeping with his wife.

I don't think the sex is the problem.

I know for a fact I was just okay.

For the record, I'm the one
who introduced you to House of Pies.

Sheldon? Oh, Leonard.

Sorry, ljust, I had
to get out of there.

What did he do now?

Nothing. He's being a dream.

Don't give me that look. That's how
Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.

Penny and I have the same
"You're crazy" look?

That's kind of sweet.

I know how to deal with
Sheldon being Sheldon,

but Sheldon being a rational,
thoughtful person?

I'm clueless.

It's like when my mom called last year
to sing happy birthday

and I just threw up.

Well, if it gets to be too much,

you can always send him back over here.

I made a deal with him,

and besides,
that wouldn't be fair to you.

Well, actually, I miss him.
He's been over there a lot.

Well, great.
Tell him he can come back.

I can't. He's thinking of me
and my feelings

and trying to be respectful.

That's what he's doing
to me, too, the jerk!

Stop that.

Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's
constipated look are the same.

- This is nice.
- It is.

She used to kiss me like that.

You Okay?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Oh, God, I'm so alone.

Sorry, I can't do this.

What's going on?

I met Oliver the other day.

Wait, you tracked down my husband?

(SIGHS) No, that would be weird.

He tracked me down,
then we spent the evening together.

I don't believe this.

He only did it
because he cares about you.

No, he did it because
he's possessive and jealous.

Really? I didn't get that at all.
He made me feel very comfortable.

Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.

You know, I don't think that
you're being very fair to him.

You're taking his side?

No, but I should point out
that he did offer

to go to counseling,
so at least one of you is trying.

You're crazier than he is.

I'll tell you what,
just give him one more chance

and if it doesn't work out,

I'll be happy to keep
sleeping with you.

You would?

Either way, you've got yourself a fella.

Like, how nice is that?

Hey, Sheldon.

- Hello.
- Hey.

So, your contract provides
for a three-day trial period,

and I don't think this is working out.

So, to put it in legal terms,

the party of the first part would like

the party of the second part to get out.

What time does the trial period end?

12:00, noon.

Yeah, what does it say after that?

Eastern Standard Time.

That was three hours ago.

And since you didn't exercise

your right to revoke,
I exercised my right to extend,

triggering this long-form
rental agreement,

of which you're already in violation.

This is just a bunch of paper.

You can't enforce this.

Hire a lawyer.
Let's find out.

This is not happening.

Be that as it may,

page nine says that
you have to provide me

with lemon-flavored sparkling
water, so, chop-chop.

Hey, how'd it go?

Well, apparently he's not leaving,

and I have to go get him
sparkling water.

Why are you smiling?

I don't know. It just feels right.

(DOOR CLOSES)

<i>Through the stars.</i>

Hey.

Hey, buddy.

I talked to Nell.

She was pretty upset after you left.

- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

She told me that you said
something so creepy

that I seemed great in comparison.

I know exactly what it was.

No, actually, there was
a couple of things it could've been.

Whichever one it was,
it was creepy.

Anyway, I went over to comfort her,

and we talked, and I think we're
gonna give it another chance.

lam so happy for you!

Hey, we should celebrate.

- House of Pies?
- You know it.

Ah!

Should we invite Nell?

RAJ: Do we have to? Nah.

BERNADETTE: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

So, Leonard, tell everyone your news.

I'm starting a book.

That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before.

He means he's writing a book.

I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science.

- Oh, Leonard.-
- It's not about you.

- Oh, boy.
- What?

They cast the new Professor Proton.

- Is it Sheldon?
- Not exactly.

SHELDON: Wheaton!

It's Wil Wheaton.

Hey, what are you doing?

I thought we were having
dinner at Leonard and Penny's.

Oh, no. No, they're watching
the new Professor Proton.

I can't keep Wil Wheaton
off the Internet,

but I can keep him off my retinas.

So you're just gonna sit here
by yourself and do nothing?

I... Of course not.

I'm going to write mean comments
about Wil's show online.

Well, you can't criticize
something you haven't seen.

Uh... I'm sorry. Are you familiar
with the Internet?

Well, what if I watch it with you?

Maybe I won't like it, and we
can complain about it together.

Get your own thing to complain about.

Oh, trust me, I've got one.

Look, a-at least if you watch it,

maybe you can find more
specific things to criticize.

Oh, that is a good point.

Criticisms are more hurtful
when they're specific.

<i>(PROFESSOR PROTON
THEME</i> SONG <i>PLAYING)</i>

<i>Hey, everybody. I'm Professor Proton.</i>

<i>Welcome to the show.</i>

<i>Today, I will be teaching you</i>

<i>how to make a real hovercraft
using common household items.</i>

Oh, darn it,
I do like objects that hover.

All you will need is a CD,

a bottle cap, a balloon,
and some Super Glue.

Oh, no! I have all those things!

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

(KEYS CLACKING)

(DOOR OPENS)

- Hey.
- Hi.

What's that noise?

Oh, uh, it's my new keyboard. Mm...

It looks and sounds like
an old-fashioned typewriter.

- It makes me feel like a real novelist.
- Oh.

You poured yourself a Scotch.

- Uh, apple juice.
- Oh.

But unsweetened,
like Hemingway used to drink.

Oh.

- So how's the book coming along?
- Uh, good.

ljust wrote the part where the hero,

hotshot physicist Logan Dean,
arrives at CERN.

Ooh, is he based on you?

Uh, kind of.
But he can eat dairy products

without having to leave the room.

Yeah, that's smart because
CERN is in Switzerland,

and there's a lot of cheese there.

Mm. Uh, believe me,
that is a plot point later.

Well, I'm excited to read it
whenever you're ready.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, oh, ljust thought
of the murder weapon!

Swiss army knife?

(CHUCKLES)

No.

(CHUCKLES)

That's way better.

Look, it works! We did it!

See? There was a reason
to keep that TurboTax CD.

Yeah.

A CD-ROM? More like "CD-vroom."

Do you feel bad you told Wil Wheaton

that you'd be his enemy
if he did this show?

No. I feel bad

I'm engaged to somebody
that would point that out.

It's time for Professor Proton's
science joke of the day.

Why can you not trust atoms?

Hmm.

Because they make up everything.

(LAUGHS) That's funny!

Yeah, because they do.
They make up everything.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, I wonder who that could be.

Just when I thought this
couldn't get any better,

Wil has introduced
suspense into the show.

Hey, it's real NASA astronaut,
Howard Wolowitz!

What?

Hey, Professor Proton.

Hey, thanks for being here.

No problem. I'm on my "launch" break.

How could Wil ask Howard to
be on his show and not me?

Well, he is an astronaut.

And he didn't start an online
petition to get Wil fired.

Why, why wouldn't Howard tell me?

Well, because he probably worried

that you'd be a big baby about it.

All those answers make a lot of sense.

Thank you, Amy. That helps.

And then, when the lights come back on

in the supercollider room,
Dr. Logan Dean makes

two important discoveries, a gluino

and murder.

Oh, gluino. That's exciting.

And murder.

I heard you.

The first time.

I don't know which Hemsworth
is playing Logan Dean,

but I know it's a Hemsworth.

Well, Logan's actually based on me.

So a young Paul Giamatti.

Well, I have to finish writing it

before they can make it into a movie,

and I-l still have a few things
to figure out.

You should talk to Bernadette.

Since she's been on bed rest,
she's binged,

like, every detective show in the world.

Well, there was a funny detective
show in India called Karamchand.

He had an assistant named Kitty,

and he was always saying,
"Shut up, Kitty!"

Sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi

and don't think of women
as having feelings.

Hello.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Howard, I want you to know
that I forgive you.

I'll take it.

What's he forgiving you for?

Don't care. Clean slate.
Happy Yom Kippur to me.

I know that you were on Wil's show,

and I know why you didn't tell me.

Do you?

Because you were afraid

that I would be difficult
and annoying about it.

I hope your book has a twist
as surprising as that.

It doesn't.

I thought you were
boycotting Wil's show.

Uh... I was,
but I decided to give it a shot,

and I actually enjoyed it.

Uh, just out of curiosity,
how did you come to be on the show?

Did he ask you? Or did you ask him?

Did you just show up on the set
and ring that doorbell?

Sheldon, if you want to be on the show,

you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.

That would be the mature thing to do.

Let's put a pin in that
and keep thinking.

- Ooh.
- What? What? Which part?

That was just the baby kicking.

Got it.

- But this is good so far, really good.
- Yeah?

Yeah. I have no idea who the killer is.

Oh, great. Me, neither.

(CHUCKLES)

So does Penny know
you based a character on her?

What character?

Ilsa, the head of the institute.
That's clearly Penny.

No, it's not.

Really?

Confident, ball-busting beauty

who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?

Trust me, that describes
more women than you think.

(CHUCKLES)

"He looked at the stunning woman
who was his boss and said..."

It's murder.

Figure that out yourself, genius?

Okay, no need to be snarky.

- Who would want to kill him?
- Could be anyone. Dr. Silvers.

Dr. Prakash.

Hans the janitor.

But the door is locked,

so it has to be someone in this room.

Wow, you are on fire.

Maybe it is a little like Penny.

Any chance she'll be flattered?

I don't know. She's pretty mean.

Ilsa or Penny?

Exactly.

Oh, hey, Howard. What's up?

I'm so sorry.

What for?

Hello.

Hello, Sheldon.

I suppose you've come here to tell me

that you've moved me
to your super secret enemies list.

I don't have
a super secret enemies list.

I'm not a Bond villain.

I'm just a regular guy
with a regular enemies list,

which, by the way, you are no longer on.

Really? Well, that is something.

It's not something that I care about,
but it is something.

He's trying to say he's sorry.

<i>I am.</i>

I watched your show,
and it's really good.

Oh, thank you.

And I regret how hard I was on you.

I want you to know

<i>that being on the Professor Proton show</i>

has been a childhood dream of mine.

So, if you're ever looking

for any more scientist guests,
I hope you'll consider me.

Well, I appreciate that, Sheldon,
and I'll keep it in mind.

- You know, actually...
- Yay!

Oh... Uh... No. No. I want to have

more female scientists
represented on the show,

and I thought maybe Amy
might be interested?

(SMALL GASP)

You... Or wouldn't it be nice

to have us both on to show

that even female scientists
can land a man?

I said, "Sorry."

So what do you think?

Oh, I like it. I can't wait
to see who the killer is.

Is it that Ilsa girl?
She seems pretty mean.

Mm... But adorably mean,
like a baby lion?

No, regular mean, like a regular lion.

But it seems pretty accurate,
considering who you based it on.

Huh.

And who do you think that is?

But the door is locked,

so it has to be someone in this room.

Wow. You are on fire.

Oh, you...

Bernadette. Yeah, sure.

Each one of you had a motive.

Who died and made you detective?

He did.

I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

a massive inferiority complex.

It's not massive.

It's just average-sized.

I don't mean to interrupt, but somebody
is tracking blood everywhere, so...

Never mind, it's me.

You say we're all suspects.

How do we know you're not the killer?

I have an alibi.

Yeah. He's not smart enough
to pull off a murder like this.

It's pretty obvious.
Blonde, mean, glasses.

- It doesn't say "glasses."
- Really?

(STAMMERS)
But it will because Ilsa does.

And you know who else wears them?

Bernadette.

And that's her 'cause it's...
It's totally her.

(KEYS CLACKING)

- Oh, Amy. Good, you're here.
- Hi. What's up?

How would you like to be on television?

Is it gonna be a news story

where I have to say you were
quiet and kept to yourself,

and I'm as shocked as anyone?

No, it's not.

<i>Wil Wheaton</i> wants <i>you to be
on Professor Proton.</i>

That's nice, but I'm not
really interested.

What do you mean?

But he wants to talk
about women in science.

Uh, you're a woman. You're in science.
You go, girl.

I'm all for promoting women in science,

but I don't really want to be
on Wil's show.

Is it because kids may be there,

and they're known carriers
of head lice? I get that.

Sure, that's the reason.

I... Wait a minute.

You're always bragging that lice
aren't attracted to you

because your scalp is so oily.
That was on your dating profile.

Okay, look,

I know you have strong feelings
about Professor Proton,

and I don't want to get
in the middle of that.

So you're not going to do something

just because you think
it might upset me?

Well, it's tricky

because answering that question honestly

is one of the things I tend
not to do because it upsets you.

Well, that's very upsetting.

Like I said.

What other things
don't you do because of me?

Remember last week, when we went

to that dueling piano bar
I was so excited about?

- No.
- Well, now you're getting it.

Boy, I don't know how people
who aren't on bed rest

keep up with the Kardashians.

Well, sometimes
you have to read in your car

while your husband thinks
you're working late.

Speaking of which, he came by
yesterday to show me his book.

Oh, and, and what did you think?

I liked it.

Really? The Ilsa character
didn't bother you?

Oh, he was exaggerating.
You're not really like that.

Well, I know I'm not like that.

The character was based on you.

I don't know what to tell you.

When I brought it up with Leonard,
he said it was you.

Well, when I brought it up, he

got all squirrelly and left the room.

Son of a bitch.

I just learned
some very distressing news.

Sometimes, Amy doesn't do things

because she's worried about
how I'll react.

First of all, it's not sometimes.
It's always.

Second, it's not Amy. It's everybody.

And third, it's not news.
It's well-established.

Yeah. Like, just now,
I wanted to get a croissant,

but I didn't want to hear
you say, "Ooh, la, la."

Uh, so you're saying
everyone walks on eggshells

to spare my feelings?

No, of course not, because we don't want

to hear you complain about
how much you hate the sound

of crunching eggshells.

I don't want my relationship
with Amy to be like that.

Sheldon, Amy knew
what she was getting into.

- You think?
- Yes, we warned her.

Well, regardless, I can change.

- Yeah, of course you can.
- Sure.

You know, everybody thinks
I'm so predictable.

Well, tomorrow,
I'm gonna show up at work

and do something no one will expect.

Wear a baseball cap backwards
to prove your point?

Yes, but which hat?

Gryffindor.

Well, now that you guessed it,
I'm not gonna do it.

Yeah, you will.

Yeah.

(SCOFFS)

Looks like the bullet
went right through you.

Damn it, Logan. When are you gonna stop?

Sorry. I didn't get my PhD in quitting.

But you're a physicist. What makes
you think you can solve a crime?

He's losing a lot of blood.

Great. I'm gonna have to clean that up.

You know what? A little soda water
might get that right out.

- We've got to find some bandages.
- No.

There's no time.

Does it hurt?

Everything you do hurts.

Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

(DOOR OPENS)

- Hey.
- So this is what you think of me?

I'm mean, and everything I do hurts you?

What are you talking about?

I know I'm Ilsa.

What... That is crazy.

You-you two are totally different.

- How?
- Well, you... She...

Her name's Ilsa.

You know what?

It's fine. Write whatever you want.

And by the way, Logan Dean
can tell everyone he's 5'8",

but he's not fooling anybody!

Are you sure that's the move
you want to make?

Absolutely.

Okay.

Checkmate.

Oh, I did not see that coming.

That's well played, Amy.

What's going on?

You beat me, and I am responding
with humility and admiration.

What does it look like?

You let me win so you could show me

how emotionally mature you are,
didn't you?

Well, I couldn't wait for you
to actually beat me.

That would take forever.

I'm sorry. It's, uh...

I'm trying to show you
that I can change.

L-I don't want you to miss out
on things because of me.

I know you don't.

You know, and maybe somewhere out there,

there is a little girl
who will see you on Wil's show

and realize that she, too, can grow up

to be a brilliant, amazing,
successful scientist.

Thank you.

Who is really terrible at chess.

- Got it.
- No, no, no. I mean, really bad.

What was your queen doing
over there, going shopping?

Well, I mean, I didn't intend
to write about Penny,

but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.

I believe you mean
"unconsciously," dear.

Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice

if you didn't correct me all the time.

It would be nice if I didn't have to.

Maybe this book of yours is a bad idea.

- What do you mean?
- Well, you're a physicist.

What makes you think
you can write a book?

You're a physicist.

What makes you think
you can solve a crime?

- Got to go.
- I think you mean "have..."

Oh, hey, Penny, good news.

- It's not you.
- What?

Ilsa. It's not you. It's my mother.

I've been writing about my mother!

I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

a massive inferiority complex.

It's not massive.

It's just average-sized.

We've got to find some bandages.

There's no time.

Does it hurt?

Everything you do hurts.

Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

Maybe you like it.

<i>I...</i> Maybe I <i>do.</i>

You know what? I'm a physicist.
What am I doing, writing a book?

WIL: Well, that is our show for today.

And I want to say
a very special thank you

to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here.

It was a real pleasure having you.

And you can feel that pleasure

because you don't have a lesion
in your nucleus accumbens.

I really hope I don't.

All right, we'll see you next time!

Amy.

You were glowing.

Stop.

Oily scalp.

I'm so proud of you.

And I'm proud of you.

Because you can't tell how jealous I am?

No, no, no. I can.

But I can tell how hard
you're trying to keep it in.

Really hard.

I'm gonna go to bed.

All right, I'm gonna go scream
on the roof.

- Love you.
- Love you.

Are you feeling any contractions?

No.

Wait. Well, where are you going?

To the hospital.

Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.

Honey, babies don't
always come on their due date.

Halley was two weeks late.

But this baby's a boy.

They don't take as long to get ready.

(CHUCKLES)

What are you doing?

I'm making the situation better
with humor.

Are you?

Would you rather me
make it better with magic?

- Go back to sleep.
- Ta-da!

You know, I hear
that sex can induce labor.

Anything for my family.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

I believe today
is Bernadette's due date.

Yeah.

How do you know that?

Easy. 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.

And why do you know that?

Well, excuse me for taking
an interest in people.

(SCOFFS)

- So, any day now.
- Oh, I don't know.

We went to the doctor this morning,

and she said it could still
be another week or two.

How's Bernadette holding up?

It's pretty rough.

She's having a hard time.

Why are you smiling?

I had sex twice last night.

That's not fair! She's on bed rest.

She can't run away.

It was her idea.

She read that it can start labor.

Mm, is that true?

Well, I would have googled it,
but I was busy taking my pants off.

Yeah, not to brag,
but Amy's last birthday

brought my coital tally up to four.

Whatever you're doing,
it's not bragging.

- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

Hey, I was just talking about you.

- Oh, should I ask?
- You should not.

I'm trying to get
our grant proposal together.

Any chance you've finished up
those mechanical drawings?

Sorry. I was gonna do it last night,
but I got kind of busy.

Yeah, you did.

What are they talking about?

I'll give you a hint.

It's something
that we have done four times.

<i>Watched La La Land?</i>

(GASPS) What? No. No.

I've not watched <i>La</i> La Land four times.

If you find the soundtrack on my phone,

that's just 'cause
our iTunes accounts are linked.

Looks like I might have
a little more time

before the baby gets here,

<i>so</i> why don't we just stay late
and get it done?

Well, I don't want you
to leave Bernadette alone.

Oh, we can hang out
and keep her company.

- Yeah, absolutely.
- See, see. Look at my Netflix queue.

There's two documentaries
and the movie Friends with Benefits,

which I thought was a documentary

about employer health care plans.

Hey, Bernie, it's me.

I let myself in.

Hey.

What are you doing?

I thought you were supposed
to be on bed rest.

That's done, but I've been on stair rest

for the last 45 minutes.

- Here, let me help you.
- Yeah.

If you really want to help,
put on a rubber glove,

reach on up there and start pulling.

I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm.

I'll do it.

Uh, ljust want this to be over.

You know, when
my yoga instructor was pregnant,

she told me there are tons of poses

that put her right into labor.

I'll try,

but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.

Okay, we're gonna start with
some nice breathing exercises.

(EXHALES)

Sorry. I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.

Oh, thank you.

Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.

Okay, we go down

and back up.

And back up!

Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.

- Hey, put that phone away!
- Smile.

I'm telling you,
there's an acupressure point

right above your ankle
that can induce contractions.

All right, but just a warning.

My feet are a little swollen.

Oh, please, Bernadette.
I'm sure this... Okay.

- What?
- Nothing.

Your ankles look fine, and not at all

like ljust popped open
a can of crescent rolls.

My mother believes that if
you're not prepared mentally,

it can delay your body
from going into labor.

So what are you trying to say?
It's my fault?

(SIGHS)

Raj is crazy.
Your ankles aren't that gross.

Hello.

Let me guess. You're here to
try to get me to go into labor.

Oh, please. I'm disgusted
when people sneeze,

and that's just stuff
coming out of their nose.

No. I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.

Oh, that's nice.

Yeah, by playing
the most complicated board game

<i>ever invented Campaign for North Africa.</i>

I bought it off eBay.

It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.

Come on, baby.

Get out here right now,
and I'll buy you a pony.

Are there any engineers
on the grant committee?

I don't know. Why?

I didn't have time to figure out
the three-input hydraulic manifold,

<i>so</i> this diagram is really just
a flux capacitor

<i>from Back to the Future.</i>

I'm sorry this is on such short notice.

Hey, ljust wish I could be
there when you present it.

That's okay.

It's more important that
you spend time with Michael.

Who's Michael?

Uh, your son?

No, it's not.

My son doesn't have a name yet.

Okay, well, then, Bernadette's son.

I can't believe her.

She knows I don't want
to name the baby after her dad.

- What did you want to name him?
- I don't know.

We were gonna wait until
we saw what he looked like.

Well, it's a baby.

Her dad's a wrinkly bald man.
That wasn't gonna break your way.

Oh, come on!

Welcome to the next five to
eight weeks of your life.

Sheldon, I said
I didn't want to play your game.

Well, then don't think of it as a game.

Think of it as a source of information

about one of the lesser known
campaigns of World War ll.

You're right. That's so much better.

I know, right?

Okay, first, we need to roll
to determine the weather.

It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?

Yes.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Michael? Really, you think
we're naming him Michael?

Not now, Howard.
I'm in the middle of a game.

You wish. You are hundreds
of hours away from the middle.

I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.

Bernie?

BERNADETTE: This is as fast as I
move! Calm down!

So you're just gonna name him Michael?

(SCOFFS) Were you even gonna tell me?

I told you.

When?

Oh, right. That was Amy.

What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.

I don't want to name our son
after your father.

I didn't want to say this,
but he's dying.

He is?

Eventually. I mean, you
see the way the man eats.

Okay, is this the hormones,

or have you always been a lunatic?

I don't even know anymore.

Bernie, this is our kid's name.

I think we should both agree.

You're right. We both made this baby.

Thank you.

And I carried it, had to
stay in bed for four months,

sacrificed my body and my job,

and soon it's gonna
burst its way out of me

like the Kool-Aid Man.

Exactly. Fifty-fifty.

I think I got Bernadette in trouble.
Maybe we should go.

I can't.

She <i>and</i> I <i>are playing
Campaign for North Africa.</i>

She doesn't want to play that.

Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.

Hey! I brought Chinese.

And I brought Indian.

What are you guys doing here?

Sheldon texted and said
Bernadette wanted us all to come over.

The game's best with
five to ten players.

Okay, if it's not Michael, then
what do you want to name him?

Harry, like Potter or Houdini.

It doesn't bother you that I have
an old boyfriend named Harry?

Okay.

How about Al or Max or

Ted or Kevin?

Same answer.

Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn.

Uh, Penny's air force
is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.

We're kind of busy.

Oh, okay. But you're being pretty rude.

Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.

You know, I always thought
Christian was a nice name.

I don't know.
Sounds a little too uncircumcised.

Bernadette, it's your turn.

What about Greg?

All right, I'll just roll for you.

Oh, that is a good one!

Your troops' morale rating
is pretty high.

Now, Leonard, as the defender,

we need to subtract your morale rating

from Bernadette's to get a final

adjusted morale rating for the assault.

And I will just check
the assault differential column.

Oh, who said war was hell?

Yeah, that's a rhetorical question.
Sherman said it.

What about Sherman?

Like, Sherman Wolowitz.

Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna
take his mother to prom.

Hey, Howard, you did that, right?

I didn't take her. She chaperoned.

We slow-danced once.

What about Paul?

Paul. Paul Wolowitz.

I like it.

Like "Koothra-paul-i."

Okay, you ruined it.

All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.

Penny, I believe,
as logistics commander, that's you.

- Okay. I surrender.
- Uh...

Nice try, Penny.

It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it

to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.

Sheldon, we're talking
about something important here.

(SIGHS) Fine. If you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?

- Sure.
- All right, here we go.

Ranatanata.

You can't name him Ranatanata.

Oh, right, it's a boy.
That'd be ridiculous.

(EXHALES) What about Ozymandias?

Are you making these up
or having a stroke?

Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

Oh! Oh! Bysshe Wolowitz.
Solved. Back to the game.

Heyo! Sandstorm!

Uh, some people name their
kids after places.

Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?

If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz,

then you have been breathing in
the poisonous gas

that my troops illegally dispersed.

Oh...

- You okay?
- I think that was a contraction.

Is it time? Do we need
to go to the hospital?

No. We've been through this before.

My water hasn't even broken yet.

Never mind your water.

Has your mucus plug popped out?

Ew, no!

Oh, you're right.
We probably would've heard that.

It's not a champagne cork.

Although that would be festive.

You know what, maybe we should go.

Did you have another contraction?

No. I'm just worried
that Sheldon's gonna say

"mucus plug" again.

And I'm worried
one's gonna hit me in the eye.

Yep, it's time.

Should we take two cars?

Uh, actually, could you
stay here and watch Halley?

That way we don't have to wait
for Bernadette's parents.

Yeah, you guys go.
We'll take care of her.

You have nothing to worry about.

Uh... Well, not nothing.

There are U-boats approaching
the Suez Canal.

It's too late for us. Go, go!
Save yourselves!

Suez? Birth?
It's a big night for canals.

How you feeling?

Eh...

But I am really excited to meet our son.

Me, too. I thought
I'd be super freaked out.

But I'm ready for this.

Well, not the part where you're in labor

and you squeeze my fingers
till they turn blue.

I'm sorry.

That must be really painful for you.

It is. I mean, last time, I...

Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.

(CHUCKLES)

(GRUNTING)

It's a big one.

Just breathe.

(EXHALES)

(SIGHS) okay-

Okay, I'm good.

I'm sorry I tried
to sneak the name past you.

That's okay.

I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.

I was really competitive
with my roommate.

(CHUCKLES)

Forget about it.

Please.

You know what, maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.

It doesn't matter what we name him.

He's gonna be amazing.

You're right.

This kid is part you and part me.

Yeah. He's gonna be smart
and kind and funny.

If he cracks five-foot-six,
it'll be a miracle.

I've always liked the name Elliott.

Sorry, can't have it.
That's my boy name.

I said it first.

It's not like calling dibs.

Yes, it is. It's exactly like that.

Dibs on Elliott.

I'm just saying,
we might get there first.

You only have sex once a year.

I'll probably have sex tonight.

Fine, you can have Elliott.

When did you pick out our kids' names?

Remember that day
you moved into the building?

Yes.

A non-creepy amount of time after that.

Yeah, I like the name Elliott.

That wasn't on my list, but I like it.

We've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.

And I have a cousin named Dilip.

Well, I wasn't going to give
them any of the good names.

I'm saving those for us.

Really? You've thought about our kids?

Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.

Oh... Well, I think so, too.

How many kids do you guys want?

- Fifteen.
- Two.

- What?
- Well, don't worry.

I don't expect you to bear them all.

I'm sure we can find a
suitable uterus to rent.

- No!
- Uh-huh!

We weren't thinking about you.

Of course not.

(GRUNTS) I am going to the kitchen.

Can I get anybody anything?

Penny, nice glass of milk
and a multivitamin?

SHELDON: Guys.

Guys, wake up. Terrible news.

Oh, my God. What, what, what?

- Is it the baby?
- No. No, no, we miscalculated

our unassigned armor class units.

We need to start over.

- What?
- No, no, no, not from the beginning.

Just from when the tanks started moving.

That was five hours ago.

No. No, that was two hours ago.
It only feels like five.

- What time is it?
- It's almost 2:30.

Don't you think
we should've heard something?

- L'm sure they're fine.
-l'm calling them.

(PHONE RINGING)

<i>Hey!</i>

Hell, everything Okay?

<i>Yeah! The baby was born
about an hour ago.</i>

Dude, why didn't you call me?

<i>The only way I would
see my son for the first time</i>

<i>and immediately think
"I need to call Raj"</i>

<i>is if he came out brown.</i>

You know, it can take some time
for pigment to form.

You're still not out of the woods.

- Well, congratulations! Yeah.
- Hey, what'd you name him?

<i>Neil Michael.</i>

<i>Neil for Armstrong,</i>

<i>Gaiman, and Diamond.</i>

<i>Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.</i>

Neil. That's cute.

<i>BERNADETTE". But we're calling
him Michael!</i>

<i>(SIGHS) I'm not gonna fight her.</i>

<i>That kid's head was the size
of a cantaloupe.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Oh, my God, I can't believe
how big Halley's getting.

Yeah. Where's Howard?

<i>He's changing Michael.</i>

<i>All done. You know, fun fact,</i>

<i>did you know baby boys
can pee straight up?</i>

Grown-up boys, too.

Why would we high-five that?

So how are you guys?

<i>BERNADETTE: Really good.</i>

<i>Except for when we went
grocery shopping,</i>

<i>and the checkout lady asked
when I was due.</i>

<i>But you handled it well.</i>

Well, if you guys need help,
I'd be happy to come over.

<i>Oh, thanks, but we're really
trying to enjoy this family time</i>

<i>before we both go back to work.</i>

Okay, well, we all miss you.

- You guys, too.
- Bye.

(SIGHS) Boy, seeing them
all together like that

has got my biological clock
ticking like crazy.

- Yeah, I don't think men have...
-l do.

- Hi.
- Hello.

- Hey, guys.
- Good news.

We have save the date cards.

<i>Â£53:</i>

Didn't go with my calligrapher.
Interesting.

What is this picture?

Oh, It's an MRI of our brains
photoshopped

to look like they're kissing.

Is it too sexy?

It's too something.

Guys, May 12, that's exciting.

- I know.
- Do you guys have a location yet?

'Cause you don't have a lot of time.

Hey, it took us nine
months to pick a date,

and a week to decide if
brains can have lips on them,

so get in the boat and row.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

- Michael's out.
- So is Halley.

Oh, my God, he's so cute.

So is she.

- Switch?
- Yeah.

- Oh, my God, he's so cute.
- So is she.

I just love them so much.

Me, too.

My heart feels like it's gonna explode.

Of course, it's full of brisket,
so it probably will.

I didn't even know I was capable
of loving someone so much.

More than me?

- Oh, what...
-l'm just messing with you.

I totally love them more than you.

I get that.

I would take a bullet for them.

But I would get seriously
mutilated for you.

That's sweet.

But you should know,
if you got seriously mutilated,

I might dump you.

You'd be crazy not to.
Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.

You know, I'm really happy
with our wedding date.

The month squared equals the
square of the sum of the members

of the set of prime factors of the day.

Isn't that romantic?

Yes, it's like that Shakespeare sonnet,

"Shall I compare thee to a day

"that's also a really weird
math problem."

It's a shame you're joking. That'd be
a lovely reading at our ceremony.

Well, we only have
two months to find a venue,

and I had a thought.

What about the Athenaeum club
at Caltech?

(EXHALES) Albert Einstein
was a member there.

- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

And Albert Einstein was a member there.

- It's close.
- And Albert Einstein was a member there.

And Albert Einstein was a member there.

There!

Now you sound like a woman
who wants to get married.

- So you're interested?
- Oh, of course.

Yeah, but that club
is extremely exclusive.

You know, Leonard's been trying
to get us in there for years,

but no luck.

Well, that's odd.

When I called, they said they'd
be excited to give us a tour.

Well, I suppose we can give it a look,

and if it doesn't work out,
I hear that there is

a nearby Chinese restaurant
that Einstein used to frequent.

Or, we pick a place we like,
and don't worry about Einstein.

(SCOFFS)

Boy, reality TV is right,
brides are crazy.

So, how has it been,
being home with two kids?

(SIGHS) Tiring, but super rewarding.

Like Pilates, yeah, got it.

Honestly, it's gonna be hard
when we both go back to work.

I've been thinking maybe
it would be better if

one of us decided to stay home.

I don't know, I was raised
by servants, and look at me.

I literally can't tell
if you think that's good or bad.

Well, on one hand, they filled
my tub with scented oils

and brought me honeyed sweets,
on the other hand,

I spent my twenties incapable
of talking to women.

So you know, pros and cons.

Here's my dilemma.
I kind of want to stay home.

But Bernadette is a way better
parent than I am.

Wait, does Bernadette want to stay home?

I don't know. She's really
invested in her career,

and she's doing great.

I think it should be me.

Wow, I admire you, Howard.

It would be hard for me to buck
traditional gender roles like that.

Didn't you see Taylor Swift
twice this month?

Yeah, because she's hot,
not because she sings my truth.

Did Albert Einstein ever sit
in any of these chairs?

I think these are fairly new.

But Stephen Hawking's eaten here a lot.

Yeah, but he brings
his own chair, you know?

Well, it seems kind of perfect,

and it's close enough to your office,

so you can use the bathroom you like.

I put a sticker over the auto-flush,
so it doesn't startle me.

Here's my card.
Why don't you two talk it over,

and I will check to see
if our soup spoons

are "deeper than they are wide."

What? Too deep is a ladle, not a spoon.

(SCOFFS)

I really like it.

Oh, I must admit, I do, as well.

Look at how somber all
the men in these portraits are.

I feel like that sets
a good tone for our wedding.

Is that Leonard?

Uh, no, no. These are all dead,
accomplished scientists.

Leonard will only ever be
one of those things.

I mean, Leonard and Penny
are right there.

But he told me he checked on
our membership just last week,

and we were still 400th in line.

I'm sure there's an innocent explanation
that won't ruin my day at all.

Leonard.

- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

How did you get in here?

What do you mean? Leonard's a member.

You told me it was incredibly exclusive.

Yeah, look, about that, I lied.

Hey, wait, you told me
it was exclusive, too.

Mm-hmm. I avoided him and impressed you,
all with the same lie.

Damn, Hofstadter, didn't
think you had it in you.

Well, I'm not sure I know
how I feel about this place now.

Then don't turn around.

Cooper!

Oh. Good, you're here.

There's (CLEARS THROAT) something
I want to talk to you about.

We're not putting a TV in the bathroom.
That's how you get hemorrhoids.

No, this is important.

Uh...

I was thinking maybe one of us should
stay home full-time, with the kids.

Oh, great, so I have to give up my job
and everything I've worked for?

Actually, I was thinking
I should stay home.

Oh, so I have to abandon
my children and go back to work,

while you get to stay home
and bond with them?

You just said you didn't want to.

No, I don't want to have to,
but if I want to, I should get to.

Do you want to?

Maybe I do.

What if I also want to?

Well, I don't know,
we can't both stay home.

Don't you think
you should go back to work,

because you make more money?

Don't you think
you should make more money?

I think it's pretty sexist of you to say

a dad can't stay home with his children.

You know what else is sexist,
the phrase "suck it,"

yet, here we are.

I can't believe Leonard lied to me.

What are we gonna find out next,

that he's not really lactose intolerant?

He's just friends with
an invisible trumpet player?

I know you're upset, but if
we want to book the Athenaeum,

we really should do it
now, and then, I promise,

we'll have our whole lives
to complain about Leonard.

Oh, somebody got a head start
on her vows.

So do we agree?
Do we want to get married there?

I don't know.

I mean, Einstein was a member.
I like that.

You know? But Leonard's a member,
and that really steams my clams.

Oh, I love it when you're folksy.
I'm just gonna call.

On the other hand, shaming
Leonard during our wedding

at the very place he betrayed me

does have a beautiful symmetry to it.

That's nice, it'll be your first
petty act as a married man.

Oh, hi, Kathleen?

Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.

I'd like to go ahead and reserve May 12.

Although, it is our wedding.

Well, maybe it shouldn't be
all about revenge.

Oh, I see.

Okay, thanks.

- Someone booked our date.
- Uh... What?

Who?

Well, well, well.

This is a pickle.

Yes, so, if you will just move
your birthday party

to a different location,
everything will be fine.

Oh, it's tricky.

I don't want to move my party,
but I also don't want to help you...

Oh, wait, I don't have a problem.

No. I do.

Yeah, you do.

- Morning.
- Hey, where you been?

Oh, nowhere special.
Just the park, the farmer's market,

then we hopped on the Gold Line
to Chinatown

because it's important for the kids
to experience other cultures.

What have you been doing?

It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping.

Oh, so are the kids.
I guess they take after you.

You're just trying to prove that
you'd do a betterjob than me.

(CHUCKLES) You're pretty sharp
having just woken up.

Howard, we both know
you can't keep up this pace.

By this afternoon you're gonna
be passed out on the couch

and I'm gonna have three
exhausted babies to deal with.

Not true. I got this.

You know, in fact,
why don't you take the day off?

Fine. Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny.

Take your time. Get a massage.

You deserve it after all
the sleep you've been getting.

Maybe Barry will change his mind.

Oh, I doubt it.

I said some pretty unprofessional things
about his work.

I may have even used the "S" word.

Subpar?

I'm not proud of it, Amy,
but I have a temper.

Well, I suppose we could pick
a different date.

Well, it took you nine months
to choose that one.

I'll pick a different husband first.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Hey, ljust, I wanted to
apologize about the Athenaeum.

- Why did you lie to me?
-l don't know.

It just seemed funny at first

and then the longer it went on,
funnier it got.

So, yeah, I guess that's why.

That's not much of an apology.

Yeah, because he's not really sorry.

Obviously, he wanted a place
to go where I wouldn't be

and apparently all of outside
wasn't enough for him.

Come on. I do feel bad.

Uh, why? Did your best friend
hurt your feelings?

- Come on, Sheldon.
- Look,

I only have time to deal
with one jerk right now

-and that's Barry Kripke.
- What?

He has the Athenaeum booked
for our wedding date

-and he won't give it up.
- Yeah, so if you could just

please leave before I get angry

and say something I will regret
about your face, your height,

your personal hygiene or
the fact that your science,

while serviceable, lacks panache.

That's actually one of the nicest things
you've ever said about my work.

And now I regret it. Goodbye.

Hey. There you are.

Yeah, ljust wanted to stop in
and see my office

before we went to lunch.

Just a few more weeks,
you'll be back full-time, huh?

Yeah.

Oh-oh. That wasn't a happy "yeah."

That was a "Hey, Leonard,
do you want to go to the gym?" yeah.

I've just been thinking
that maybe I'd rather

stay home with the kids and be a mom.

Wow. That's big.

I know.

Dr. Rostenkowski.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were back.

I'm not
ljust came to meet Penny for lunch.

Is there anything I can get you?
Coffee? Water?

- No, I think we're just gonna...
- Coffee sounds good.

- Cold brew, almond milk?
- Perfect.

Nothing, nothing for me.

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

It's weird. I've been away so long
I don't miss any of this.

(PHONE BEEPS)

<i>MAN 1: Sorry to bother you.</i>

<i>Dr. Lee heard you were here
and had a quick question.</i>

Yeah, fine. Put him on.

Jerold, what's going on?
Hope you're not screwing up my research.

You calling from a bike ride?
'Cause you're backpedaling hard.

All right, fine. Email it over.
I'll take a look.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, sorry. Where were we?

Love your kids. Don't miss your job.

Right, right.

There's nothing in the world
like holding your sleeping baby,

knowing you make him
feel safe and then...

Oh, good, you got the little cookies
I like.

I wouldn't mind a cookie.
And he's gone. Okay.

(KNOCKS)

- Hey, Kripke.
- Hello, Hofstadter.

Why are you cleaning that out
yourself? Don't you have grad students?

Come on, I can't make my grad
students do every dirty job

or so I've been told in writing
by the head of Human Resources.

Fair enough. Uh, so, look,

I'm here to ask you
to give Sheldon and Amy

the Athenaeum for their wedding.

(LAUGHS)

Why would I do that?

Because deep down, Barry,
you're a really good guy.

But am I?

Fine. What's it gonna take?

Barry, I've come to ask one more...

Leonard? Why are you doing that?

Because deep down
Barry is not a good guy.

Uh, he's making you clean out
barrels of irradiated grease?

Yeah. Uh...

I made a deal with him

to get you the Athenaeum
for your wedding.

Why would you do that?

Because I was a jerk
for lying to you before

and besides, you're my best friend.

I want you to have
the wedding of your dreams.

On Mars?

Okay, I want Amy to have
the wedding of her dreams.

Well, thank you.

But I don't want you to do this.

- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

We're not going to let Barry win.

Well, what are we going to do?

We have a combined IQ of 360.

Perhaps more if that radiation
gave you a super brain.

You know what? You're right.

If we work together we could
totally outsmart Barry Kripke.

Leonard, my nose itches. What do I do?

(EXHALES) Boy. I really passed out hard.

Yeah, tell me about it.

The kids could've screamed bloody murder
and you wouldn't have woken up.

Which I know because they did.

I'm sorry.

Why did I think I could
do this on my own?

Hey, don't beat yourself up.
Parenting is hard.

Like, I've seen and smelled things today
that I cannot unsee or unsmell.

- Thanks for covering for me.
- No, I mean he only drinks milk.

Like, where are the colors coming from?

- What time is it?
- Uh, it's almost 6:00.

Okay. Bernadette's gonna be home soon.
We gotta divide and conquer.

I'll make dinner. You watch the kids.

- Kids are asleep.
- Great, then you make dinner.

Hey, good news, Amy.

We got the Athenaeum.

Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

How'd you get Barry to change his mind?

Well, I couldn't have clone it
without Leonard.

Boy, you should've seen us in there.

We were like Batman and Robin.

Why do I have to be Robin?

If you have to ask, you're Robin.

What happened?

Well, we scrubbed out some
barrels of irradiated grease,

rinsed off in a safety shower
and then told Barry Kripke what is what.

And he just gave in?

Well, we agreed to invite him
to the wedding.

Okay. No problem.

And he gets to bring a date.

- Well, that's reasonable.
- Yeah.

And if she charges by the hour,
we have to cover it.

What else did you agree to?

Well, uh, you know
how Barry has the voice of an angel?

He is not singing at our wedding.

He only wants to sing Volare.

<i>Oh, Volare.</i>

That's what he was saying.

Boy, I didn't, I did not get that.

Guys, I appreciate everything you did,

but we can find another location
that's just as good.

Maybe the Japanese garden
or the planetarium.

(GASPS) The planetarium.
I hadn't thought about that.

That's even better.

Wait, what?

I scrubbed sludge for you.

Uh, I may be slightly radioactive.

Oh, you're exaggerating.

Don't let him touch the silverware.

Why is Raj asleep on our couch?

I needed some help so he came by,

played with the kids,
read them some stories,

put them down for their nap
and made dinner.

What'd you do?

Ate dinner.

Okay, look, I don't think I'm cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad.

And since you want to,
you should stay home.

I do definitely want to,

but I know how much this means
to you and it was just one day.

So, don't give up.

You don't want to stay home, either.
Do you?

When I went by the office they gave me

coffee and cookies
and no one peed on me.

I miss that so much.

Well, I love the kids,
but I also love my job.

And sleep.

I know. I took a two-hour nap
on the couch in my office.

I took a three-hour nap on
the floor in the living room.

- How do you feel now?
- Honestly? Still tired.

Me, too.

-L love you.
-l love you, too.

And we'll figure this all out.

Yeah.

Everyone's asleep.

You want to head upstairs and,

(CHUCKLES) you know.

Let's just do it right here.

Oh-oh, I like the way you think.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

But why do they still call Batman
using the Bat-Signal?

Wouldn't it just be, like,
easier to text him?

The Bat-Signal
isn't just to alert Batman,

it's also to strike fear
in the hearts of his enemies

and let them know he's coming.

Sort of like Sheldon's knock. (CHUCKLES)

Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it.

If we don't do anything how long do you
think they'll talk about Batman?

Well, I've known them for 11 years,
so 11 years.

I believe they do text him.

The Bat-Signal is linked
to his phone via Bluetooth.

Has that been in the comics?

No, it's just what I believe.

All right, I'm putting a stop to this.

If you knew how,
why'd you wait eleven years?

Hey, guys, guess what?

Today at work I found out
I'm going to meet Bill Gates.

(ALL GASPING)

Sorry, Leonard,
you and Penny had a good run.

I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.

Are you sure?
I bet his internet's really fast

How did this happen?

Well, his foundation is looking to
partner with a pharmaceutical company

to help develop affordable vaccines,
so they asked me to show him around.

That's great, when's he coming?

He gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning

I'm gonna give him a tour
of the labs and offices.

Oh.

He gets in on Sunday, April 1st.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Nice try, Penny.

What are you talking about?

April Fools' Day.

This is another one of your classic
pranks you try to pull on me every year.

Literally never pulled a prank on you.

Oh, really? What about last year,
when you sent me that email

with the photo attached
but you didn't attach a photo?

That was a mistake.

Messing with me, yes, it was.

And this year, I'm not falling for it.

- Sheldon, I swear--
-(EXCLAIMS) What are you doing?

Oh, you're right.
He's not coming. April Fools.

You know what they say,
fool me N times,

where N equals the amount of times
you've already fooled me, shame on you.

Fool me N plus one times, shame on me.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

So you're gonna spend a day
with Bill Gates, I'm a little jealous.

I'm a little nervous.

You know if I do a good job,

I'm hoping they'll consider me
for a PR position that's opening up.

Well, if you're nervous...
(STUTTERS) I know a lot about him,

I can fill you in
or maybe come along, whatever.

<i>(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</i>

I think I'll be okay.

Well, I'm just saying, what are you
gonna do when he wants to talk about

high-level language interpreters
for microcomputers?

What are high-level language
interpreters for micro-computers?

A way of programming computers

using words and commands
instead of binary code.

Oh, that's actually kind of interesting,
tell me more.

- Oh, well--
- That, I'll do that.

I didn't even see it coming.

Yeah, well, you never do.

(STUTTERS) Look,
it's just, he's an idol of mine

and I would love the chance
to hang out with him.

Look, I know you want to meet him but
I can't turn this into a social thing,

okay, this is my job,
I really need it to go well.

I get it, I get it, you're right.

Actually, I've already met him
once before.

He gave a talk at Princeton
and my mom took me.

Oh, really? Was he nice?

He was super nice.

I got pretty emotional
and started crying

and he didn't make fun
of me or anything.

Well, you were a kid.

Uh-huh.

Bye, my babies, I love you.

(MIMICKING CHILDREN)
We love you too, Mommy.

Yeah, don't do that.

AMY: Bernadette?

Hi. Where are you off to?

<i>El parque.</i>

<i>"El Parque?"</i>

Learning Spanish
so I can talk to the other nannies.

(CHUCKLES)

How's that going?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(IN ENGLISH) Good?

Oh.

(STUTTERS)

<i>No bueno.</i>

- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

Can I get you anything?
Juice box? 'Naners?

'Naners?

(GRUNTS) Sorry. Mom brain.

I think I forgot how to talk
to grown-ups.

I meant ba-naners.

- You know what, I'm good.
- Okay.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)
- So what are we watching?

<i>Bob the Builder. I'll catch you up.</i>

That one's Bob.

He's a builder.

Isn't this a kid's show?

It's what we watch in this house.

<i>Bob the Builder,
Dinosaur Train and Peppa Pig,</i>

which is both funny and meaningful.

You wanna take a break
and maybe get something to eat?

Sure.

Why does it not feel like we're going?

Hang on, ljust want to see
if Bob can fix it.

(CHUCKLES) Yes, he can.

Oh, hey.

I folded your laundry for you.
You're welcome.

Uh, that's not mine.

You're saying that these aren't yours?

No.

So you're saying that I'm touching
a stranger's underpants?

Yes.

And just like that
it's the worst day of my life.

- Hey, why are you being so weird?
-(SIGHS)

It occurred to me that perhaps you were
telling the truth about Bill Gates

and it wasn't just
part of an elaborate prank.

What would the prank part even be?

I show up to meet Bill Gates
over your "objections"

but it's not Bill Gates at all,

no, it's one of those look-a-likes
that you hire for a party

and then when I go around
showing everybody the balloon animal

that Bill Gates made for me,
I look like an idiot.

Have you been eating laundry detergent?

I just need you to tell me the truth.
This is driving me crazy.

Sheldon, he is really coming.

- Is he?
- He is.

- Really?
- Yeah.

(SIGHS)

Well, now I don't know what to believe.

Thanks for getting me out of the house,
I feel like my brain is turning to mush.

Happy to help.

Did I show you the video
of the kids sitting?

Yes, you texted it to me at 3:00 a.m.
(CHUCKLES)

Thought someone
was either in jail or dead. (CHUCKLES)

I'm sorry.

No, no, it gave me something to watch
while I tried to go back to sleep.

You know what, I don't wanna be
one of those moms

who can only talk about her kids.

Okay, well,
I'm reading a pretty good book.

It's the untold story of female artists
during the Renaissance.

Oh, I'm in the middle of a book too,

it's three pages long
and it floats in the bath.

All right. We can talk about
something else.

It also quacks when you squeeze it,
you should've seen Michael laugh.

I think I have a video.

Or maybe we can't.

(VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS)

Why is your screen name "John Williams?"

Uh, because I always score.

Hey. I think I'm gonna head
to the office for a little bit.

On a Sunday?

Yeah, just wanna make sure
I'm prepared for tomorrow.

Do you think you could get Bill Gates
to sign something for me?

Yeah, maybe, like what?

My arm, my chest, his call.

His call will be to the police.

Penny, remember when I introduced you
to hundred calorie Dove Bars

and you said you owed me,
like, big time?

Guys, even if I wanted
to introduce you,

there is no room in his schedule.

I mean, look at this itinerary.

I meet him at his hotel
first thing tomorrow morning,

and then we're on the go all day long.

You're right. Guys, this is her job,
we need to respect that.

Thank you, honey.

Proud of you.

Love you.

I totally just saw
what hotel he's staying at.

What are we waiting here for?

For Penny to walk down the stairs,
get in her car and drive away.

Right, smart. (CLEARS THROAT)

That long enough?

She's pretty quick, let's go.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

What would you do
if you had a billion dollars?

Same as Bill Gates,
try to make the world a better place,

but I'd do it
in a working Iron Man suit.

I didn't know that came
in a boys medium.

(STUTTERS) This is a bad idea,
maybe we should go.

What are you talking about?

(STUTTERS) I don't know,
I'm just feeling guilty

like I'm kinda sneaking around
behind Penny's back.

We're not doing anything wrong.

We're just hanging out in a hotel
lobby, plenty of people do that.

The businessmen,
the high-end prostitutes.

That's a fun new game, CEO or ho.

No, this is wrong, let's go.

Guys, guys, that's him. Be cool.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Cooler.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

(STUTTERS) Mr. Gates,
I'm Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

we've actually met before.

Sorry, I don't remember.

You were so nice... (STUTTERS)
And it was really special to me

because you've been
such a big influence on my life.

I mean, ever since I was a little kid,
I've looked up to you like a hero.

Oh, now I remember.

Would you like a tissue?

How about a hug?

How about a tissue?

Sorry I talked about my kids
the whole time.

Oh, don't worry about it.

I mean, besides you cutting up
my meat for me, it was a lovely lunch.

God, what's happening?

I'm a smart, educated, successful...
(STAMMERS)

Woman?

I was gonna get it.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

Pregnancy and childbirth
actually cause physical changes

to the structure of your brain.

I liked the old structure of my brain.

But then I liked
a lot of my old structures.

Well, these are positive changes.

Studies with rats show that new mothers
are more sensitive to danger,

better at multitasking
and bolder in the pursuit of food.

I did stick a couple
of lamb chops in my purse.

So that's what I was smelling.

Look, even though your brain
is different, in many ways it's better.

But were you bored?

Of course not.

You're lying.

Which you can tell
because your maternal brain

is better at sensing non-verbal cues.

Now you're just being condescending.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Look at you, two-for-two.

LEONARD: Hold the door, hold the door.

Oh, hi, Leonard.

Didn't you hear me yell "hold the door"?

I did. But you know what they say,
"hold the door, get robbed some more."

No one says that.

Oh. Well, they should
because it's true and it rhymes.

So, where have you been?

Actually, I met Bill Gates.

(SIGHS)

I see, you're all in on it,
ah, nice try.

It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon.
I actually went to a hotel and met him.

Right, right. Okay, so, "Bill Gates"
was at the "hotel" that you "went to."

Why is "went to" in quotes?

Fine. So "Bill Gates" was at the "hotel"
that you went to.

That's you and Bill Gates.

It is.

- Were you crying?
- No.

So it wasn't a joke
and I actually could have met him?

He's probably still there.

(GASPS) What hotel?

The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks
under the name Hernandez.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

April Fools.

(KEYS CLATTER)

- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

Ah, just hanging out with the guys.

They still mad at me?

Uh, they were,
but then I was like, "Hey."

And they were like, "What?"
and I was like, "You know,"

and they were like, "Okay. "

You're a good husband.

Well, it's not for me to say but you
just said it so you're probably right.

Well, as it turns out,
there is a little reception

for Mr. Gates tomorrow night, I asked
if I could bring you and they said yes.

What?

Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.

Wait, what do you mean again?

'Cause you met him
that one time with your mom.

Yes.

And then again tomorrow for
a total of two and only two times.

Yeah, I wonder if he'll remember you.

Yeah, I wonder that too.

<i>BERNADETTE: (THROUGH SPEAKERS}

Sweet dreams.

Wow. Hop on Pop took
a dark turn there at the end.

Amy made me realize
that new mothers are cognitively primed

to take in new information,

and I've been wasting it
making up songs about our babies' toes.

To be fair I co-wrote
Pinky Toe Pinky Toe.

Evolution gave me this mom brain
to focus on the baby,

but I figure I can hack it

That's great.

Yeah, there was a problem
and I fixed it.

Like, Bob the Builder
in that giraffe cage.

Spoiler alert,
I didn't see that one yet.

So that's fun,
you get to meet Bill Gates again.

It's not fun, I'm screwed.

It's fun for us. (CHUCKLES)

Maybe he won't remember you.

I snotted on his tie.

Yeah, you did, like a lot.

Hello, Leonard.
I thought I'd find you here.

You snake.

What's going on?

He sent me all the way to Thousand Oaks
to meet Bill Gates

when he knew full well
he wasn't staying there.

Leonard, that's terrible.

Yeah, why would you do that?

You know he's staying
at the Double Tree in Long Beach.

Ah-ha.

Wait, how do I know
you're not tricking me?

We probably are.

(SIGHS)

But what if we're not?

You think you're so smart.

You think I'm going to fall for it
again, don't you?

Well, I won't.

- Where you going?
- Shut up.

Aw, you sure you can't come?

I want to but I'm just too sick.

(PENNY SIGHS)

You really wanted to meet him.

I know. I've been trying to hide it,
so I could go

but I don't wanna make him sick.

You know, you do look
pretty pale and clammy.

Yeah.

Have fun.

Well, feel better, okay.

No, that's just my regular
pale and clammy.

I mean, really the bigger danger
isn't the loss of mass

instead it will run out of hydrogen
to use for nuclear fuel,

swell up into a red giant
and fry the Earth.

So you don't want to split a salad?

No, thank you.
But speaking of splitting things,

did you hear about
the light-splitting greenhouse film

that could improve
photosynthetic efficiency?

<i>No</i>. (SIGHS)

Just a little something I read while
nursing a human being that I made.

- L'm just gonna get the chicken.
- Ah.

N-E-K-C-I-H-C.
Chicken backwards boom, mom brain.

And a whole bottle of wine.

Oh, oh, oh. Oh, in your face. (LAUGHS)

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

Oh, hey sweetie, how ya feeling?

Oh, okay, I'm just resting.

<i>Well, I have a surprise
that might make you feel better.</i>

Oh, really?

<i>Yeah, look who's here.</i>

<i>Wait, I know you.</i>

No, you don't.

<i>Yes, I do. You were waiting for me
at my hotel.</i>

<i>You ruined my tie.</i>

<i>Wait, what? What's he talking about?</i>

Uh...

He obviously, he's kidding. (CHUCKLES)

(STUTTERS) That's a good one Bill,
I gotta go.

SHELDON: Stupid Leonard

meeting stupid Bill Gates

without stupid me.

Aw.

I'm so sorry... Sheldon?

Leonard, I can't stay mad at you.

Apology accepted.

What's for dinner? I'm starving.

<i>Mi Ilamo</i> Stuart Bloom.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?

Halley bit me.

(LAUGHS) You got beaten up by a girl.

Hey, that's sexist.

You're right.

(LAUGHS) You got beaten up by a baby.

- Hi.
- Hey.

Whatcha got there?

I grabbed a sandwich
from the food truck out front.

(STAMMERS) Hold on, tonight is Friday
and I believe you know what that means.

That my fun, young life
took a drastic turn somewhere.

- No.
- But, yeah.

No, that means it's Chinese food night.

Yeah, and you have Chinese food,
so eat it.

But, I can smell your pastrami.

And we can all hear your complaining,
so, no one's happy.

It does smell good.

It is, I had one the other day.

What is happening?

Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

Well, actually, I believe the Chinese
may have invented the sandwich.

Their dish "rou jia mo" literally means
"meat between bread."

So, looks like all of us, including
Penny, are eating Chinese food.

Except for you Sheldon,
you're eating crow.

I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting
that the sandwich

was invented by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

Oh! The truck's called
Pearl of Sandwich. Now, I get it. Mmm.

All right, that smells too good.
I gotta get one of those.

And, I think you're forgetting that
there are written documents

of meat between bread being eaten
in China during the Tang Dynasty.

You know what, I'll go with you.
And then, maybe we just go home.

I think you're defining bread
very loosely.

If we go down that road,
where does it end?

I would say when we go to bed,
but you talk in your sleep.

I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

We'll talk about this when I'm asleep.

I don't wanna talk about it
when you're asleep.

How come we can't talk about it now?

Because I'm eating now.

Fine, how's your Moo shu?

You know what, it's great.

What? Look at that.

Hmm.

Maybe the Chinese did invent
the sandwich.

I guess you were right.

Too bad no one's around to hear it.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

I can smell that food truck
from up here.

Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

Of course, I like the smell,
it's salt and fat.

My brain may be evolved

but my tongue still wants to
pick up a club

and drag that truck back to my cave.

So there's something you like
but it's also driving you crazy.

Been there, doing it now.

No, it's a distraction.

Now, how can I focus on my work
when all I can think about

is how much I want that sandwich?

So, go get one.

I can't just give into every urge
I have when I have it.

That's why I have a rigid schedule.

It's bad enough I had to give into
my urge to create a rigid schedule.

You know, why don't ljust go down
to the food truck and ask them to move?

- Why are you taking cash?
- No reason.

Ah! This is the life.
What could be better than this?

If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

I'll give it back.

Huh. You know the rule.

Once it touches heinie,
it's no longer miney.

You're such a prude. Do you know all the
things this water is touching right now?

Well, I'm relaxed enough.

Hey, Howard, look.

What's that?

HOWARD: Huh.

Looks like someone's drone.

Oh, no, do you it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach-bod.

One of the propellers is broken,
it must've crashed.

Oh. Do you think you could fix it?

Maybe. Should we try
and track down the owner first?

Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

Anyone lose a drone?

Looks like it's ours.

Yay, we got a drone!

- Shh!
-(WHISPERS) Oh! Yay, we got a drone.

The pastrami truck moved.

That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

No, apparently someone complained
to the tenants association.

They're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

Who would complain about something
that everyone loves? Oh.

Did you complain to the tenants
association about the food truck?

- Yes.
- PENNY: Wha...

They actually took you seriously?
(SIGHS)

Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

Great, because I'm about to send them
an email complaining about you.

-(PENNY SIGHS)
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Excuse me.

Wow.

Someone should have spell-checked.

- What is going on here?
- You're the tenants association?

(LAUGHS) You should see
the look on your face.

And you might want to tell your wife
that there's no "Y" in pastrami.

Okay, that oughta do it,

I've replaced the propeller and
reattached the gimbal controller unit.

Dude, you're like
Grey's Anatomy for robots.

Also, why isn't that a show?

I just need to see if I can re-sync
the controls to this old remote.

We should name it.

What? The drone
or your stupid robot show?

The drone. The show's already
got a name, General <i>Bot-spital.</i>

(WHIRRING)

I got it working! (CHUCKLES)

RAJESH: Oh! Oh!

Let's play William Tell.

I'll put this bowl on my head,

see if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

You read my mind.

What are you doing?

Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

Be careful, they don't make
that bowl anymore.

It's a nice one.

Yeah, we found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

Aren't you worried there's some kid
out there missing his drone?

Oh, please, Bernadette,
this is not a children's toy, okay?

This thing's got a HD camera on it.

Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich Peeping Tom

out there missing his drone?

We asked around and no one claimed it.
Ha. I think we've done all we can do.

Did you check the video card?

Maybe you could see
where it started off from.

(WHISPERS) What a great idea, honey.

So, let me get this straight,

you are the president
of the tenants association?

President, only member
and harshest critic.

I once gave myself an official reprimand
for conducting a meeting in the shower.

The steam warped my gavel.

Okay, so, when I got a fine for leaving
my clothes in the dryer too long,

that was from you?

$14.99, the exact price of a new gavel.

And the noise complaint we got
for singing you "Happy Birthday?"

As a friend, I was touched.

As a representative of the building,

I thought that you should pick a key
and stick with it.

Hi.

Do you know he's
the entire tenants association?

No, but I'm not surprised.

He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

Why didn't you tell me?

I wanted to make that sure
you loved the man, not the office.

You can't just
declare yourself president.

I didn't. I called a meeting,

I was the only one to attend,

I nominated myself

and after a pretty moving speech,
I voted myself in.

Well, if you can vote yourself in,
then we can vote you out.

- Yeah.
- Fine make a motion at the next meeting.

When is that?

It's the first Saturday
of every month.

Unless there's an emergency meeting.

Then we call an emergency meeting.

You don't really have to,
this is the first Saturday of the month.

Okay, fine, then, we vote you out.

(STAMMERS) Hold 0n, hold on,

first, we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

Amy, would you do the honors?

Why not?

"Saturday, March third,
7:05, meeting called to order.

"7:06, president gets shampoo in eye."

SHELDON: Mmm-hmm.

"7:07, meeting adjourned."

Okay, can we vote you out now?

Ah! Very well. New business.

I move for a vote of no confidence
in the president.

- Yeah.
- Two to one, you lose.

Not so fast.

I believe we have one tenant here
who has not made her voice heard.

Oh.

We're waiting, fiancÃ©e.

Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.

Yeah, we're waiting,

neighbor who needed a battery

and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

I don't wanna be in the middle of this.

No matter which way I vote,
I'm either a bad friend,

a bad fiancÃ©e or
an ungrateful recipient of a battery.

Next time I have a meeting
in the shower, you're welcome to attend.

Sheldon, Sheldon for president,
I pick Sheldon.

Can't believe my best friend
sided with Sheldon.

Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.

Ugh. I should've taken that gavel
and shoved it right down his throat.

Ugh. I would've gone the other way
but it would've gotten to this throat.

What?

Don't be mad at me,
I mean, I can't vote against him.

What? Even when he's being crazy?

What other times are there?

So you'll just let him
get away with anything?

Well, not anything,

but honestly, pastrami sandwich
is not the hill I want to die on.

It's not about the sandwich,
it's about the principle.

Yeah, principle.
And a little bit sandwich.

Yeah.

Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building,

all you need is
for one of them to vote your way,

and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

Hey, you know
that's actually a good plan.

That you came up with all by yourself.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

told Sheldon I was going to the market

so taking some of your stuff.

I was never here.

Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

but she's pretty weird.

Okay, all hooked up. Here we go.

(SIGHS) I hope there's
nothing disturbing on there.

Like you two in a hot tub?

Hold on, now I'm getting a picture.

It's not very much to go on.

Oh, that's plenty to go on.

We can't give up, we gotta find her.

You just wanna find her
'cause she's cute.

Not just because she's cute.

She also owns a pretty expensive drone

which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it

and I... I like that in a woman.

Do you see anything
that can help us locate her?

Mmm, let me have a look.

She's got eagle eyes.

Always spotting
continuity errors in movies.

(CHUCKLES) It's not annoying at all.

Oh, there. Right there.

Check out the pin on her jacket,
isn't that from the comic book store?

Mmm. ls it? Hey, Howard, zoom in.

Fine, zooming in.

(VOCALIZES WHOOSHING)

Yeah, I know you're being a jerk,
but it's actually helpful.

Hey.

Hi, we're your neighbors
from downstairs.

We've met.

Remember I invited you
to my housewarming when I moved in?

Oh, yeah, sorry, you know,
it's been a crazy couple of months.

That was two years ago.

Welcome to the building.

So I'm running for
president of the tenants association,

I could really use your vote.

You said you were gonna stop by,
I bought a lot of food.

Anyway, meeting's tomorrow,
we really hope you can make it.

- I'll be there.
- Ah, really?

Yeah, you should buy a lot of food.

So, I'm running for
president of the tenants association

and I could really use your vote.

Uh, who's president now?

Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

You know, about yay tall
and about yay annoying.

(CHUCKLES)

So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

Yeah. You just need to show up
at a meeting and-

Oh, no, no, no can do.

He's got a restraining order against me.

Really? Why?

I locked him on the roof once.
(LAUGHS, WHISPERS) Three times.

So, Mrs. Petrescu, we were hoping

you would vote for Leonard
instead of voting for Sheldon.

Vote Sheldon.

No, no, vote Leonard.

No, vote Leonard.

No. Vote Leonard.

Thank you.

She's wearing a pin from your store.
Do you know who she is?

Oh, sure, yeah, that's Cynthia.

Wha... So she's a customer?

Yeah, yeah,
but I... I haven't seen her in a while.

And before you say anything,
there's a lot of reasons

women stop coming here,
it's not just me.

But this time?

It was me. Yeah.

I was trying out a flirty new smile.

Now, I don't use
the word "ghoulish" a lot

(SIGHS) but ljust can't think
of another word.

Wait, do you know how to find her?

Yeah, I think I have her address
on my mailing list.

Hey, please let me bring
the drone back to her.

You think you've got a shot?
What if she's married?

- She's not.
-It's meant to be.

Little tip. Uh,
stick with the smiles you know.

Hi, what are you doing?

Leonard and Penny are trying to turn
the tenants against me.

So they are about to see
just what kind of power

the president
of the tenants association wields.

"You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine."

I'm going to hang it up higher
than Leonard.

Then his clothes will smell

and nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes. No.

Not when there's a perfectly
unscented incumbent on the ballot.

Sheldon, I have an advanced degree
in the study of the human brain,

so if my fiancÃ©'s a raving lunatic,
it's kind of a ding on my reputation.

If leaders just stepped aside every time
they didn't have the consent

of the governed, what would we have?

Democracy.

Not on my watch.

Okay, don't be weird,
don't be weird, don't be weird.

(IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.

Hey, you found my drone.

Yeah, yes, it took a while
to track you down,

but to see the look on your face,
it was worth it.

Aw.

That's sweet. (CHUCKLES)

Rajesh.

- Cynthia.
- Pleasure to meet you.

Likewise.

I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

- No, I insist.
- How about your phone number?

Give me your phone.

Thanks. So, I'll call you, Cynthia.

- Great, Rajesh.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

- And thanks again.
- Uh, sure.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

RAJESH: Just checking.

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

Hey, Sheldon,
we found something pretty interesting.

Huh.

Well, that is surprising.

I for one have no idea
what they're talking about.

Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment

she was put on the lease, not you.

Yeah and when I moved across the hall

you got taken off the lease
and I got added.

What are you saying?

That Sheldon's not technically
a tenant at all

and therefore has no standing to be
president of the tenants association

no matter who votes for him?

I don't know how you found that out
but I'm guessing all on your own.

So looks like we need to figure out
who the new president should be.

- I nominate myself.
- I second it.

Huh.

Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

Well, this is hard for me

because I do love a legal technicality,

and this is a good one.

Although not quite as good
as the provision in California law

which states a person who occupies
a dwelling for thirty consecutive days

becomes a tenant at will. And as such-

- I vote for Leonard.
- You...

What?

I'm sorry, Sheldon.

With minimal power
comes minimal responsibility,

and you couldn't handle it.

You-

Don't you misquote Spider-Man to me.

It's not your fault.

I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced by the power

To decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

Wait, you're the reason I had to come
back and get my jeans the next morning?

I can't believe you expect me
to give that up.

(PENNY SIGHS)

Sheldon, it's the American way,
the peaceful transfer of power.

I don't know.

Think about Ant-Man.

I'm always thinking about Ant-Man.

Michael Douglas had the suit
and then he passed it on to Paul Rudd.

(SIGHS)

Maybe you're right.

Really? The Ant-Man thing,
that's what won you over?

Yes, he got the details right,
that's how you use a superhero.

(BOTH SIGH)

I suppose it is time
I pass this on to Leonard.

- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

Uh, I know that's hard for you.

Well, it was, but you know what?

Instead of being in charge,
I can now be the vocal opposition,

criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.

I think you'll be really good at that.

Me too.

I think I've made a huge mistake.

Me too.

Can't believe you got her number.

(SIGHS) I know, right?

How amazing would it be
if this worked out

and the story of howl met my wife

started with you and me
in the hot tub together?

(CHUCKLES)

No, do us both a favor
and start the story later.

Whatever. I have a good feeling about
this girl, like we really hit it off.

<i>RAJESH". Stop flying it around,
you're gonna break it.</i>

-(DRONE BUZZING)
- Why do <i>you</i> care?

<i>Because we have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.</i>

<i>- Aw.
-l mean, did you see how hot she was!</i>

<i>I want to get all up on that
and start making babies.</i>

<i>I know exactly what underwear
I'm gonna wear on our first date.</i>

<i>None!</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

English - SDH

RAJ: If Bruce Banner is driving
a rental car and turns into the Hulk,

do you think he's covered or

does he need to
add the Hulk as an additional driver?

You really need a girlfriend.

(GASPING) Mailman's here!

Aw. Remember when he used to
get that excited to see us?

Do you have any mail
for Doctor Sheldon Cooper?

I do, but I can't hand it right to you,
I have to put it in the box.

And that is what
separates the U.S. Postal Service

from those hippies at FedEx.

Oh, goody.

What is so exciting?

It's a letter from Doctor Wolcott.

We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.

Wait, Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem, Wolcott?

The very same.

RAJ: Didn't he go crazy
and cut off all contact with people?

HOWARD: Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend

who kept wanting to
talk about the Hulk's car insurance.

Oh, he's invited me
to his cabin for the weekend

To discuss a breakthrough he's had.

HOWARD: His cabin?

Yes, he lives off the grid
up in the mountains.

So, you're gonna
go to the middle of nowhere

and spend the weekend
with a crazy man you've never met?

Yes, why?

No reason, have fun.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

SHELDON: Hmm.

Oh.

Hmm.

(LAUGHING) Nice one.

Hey, Penny, that's what you sound like
when you read.

- Hey.
- What, he said it.

Sheldon, what are you doing?

I'm decoding Doctor Wolcott's letter
using this book as the key.

Aren't conversations more fun
when they're in code?

Yes, but I'm using a code
where "yes" means "no."

Oh, I got it.
He's given me directions to his cabin.

Seems a little paranoid.

Wha- He is not paranoid.
(CLEARING THROAT)

What are you doing?

Following his instructions.

Leonard, you are not letting
Sheldon go alone this weekend.

Well, I am a grown man,
I don't need somebody to chaperone me.

I just need him to drop me off,
pick me up and pack me a sack lunch.

Don't look at me.

When the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.

Amy can't take him, it's her
bachelorette party this weekend.

Yes, it is! Because I'm getting married!

Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?

Yes, do you know why?

Because you're getting married!
(WHOOPING)

(WHOOPING)

All right, Leonard,
looks like you're driving me.

But maybe you could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain,

I want him to think I'm cool.

HOWARD: That's great,
everyone's got weekend plans.

Amy has her bachelorette party

and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods
and get hunted for sport.

Yeah, as someone who has to track him
every time he gets lost in IKEA,

I fee I like I'd be really good at that.

Leonard, you cannot drop him off,

you have to stay with him
and keep him safe.

Howard, you have to go
and keep Leonard safe.

- Fine.
-l get it.

And you want me to go
and keep Howard safe.

- Actually, I-
- Just say yes

or he's gonna want to
come to the bachelorette party.

Are you sure
you're going to be okay this weekend?

Of course.
I'm much more concerned about you.

I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.

You do?

I've read the Bacchae by Euripides.

Drinking wine, riding panthers...

Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2500 years.

Well, I wish I could say
none of that is gonna happen,

but Penny is planning it,

and she is the reason I own those
underwear with writing across the butt.

Well, just be careful
and use protection.

What do you think is gonna happen?

I don't know, but it's going to be sunny
and you burn easily.

It'll be fine.

I'm sure there'll be some drinking
and some dancing

and then a mailman will probably show up
and take his clothes off.

Nicholas is going to
take his clothes off?

No, not our mailman.
A dancer pretending to be a mailman.

Impersonating a federal employee,
oh, where's the after party, prison?

It's sweet that you're worried about me.

Well, of course I'm worried about you.
I want you to be safe.

And I want you to be safe.

I will be. I'll have my friends with me.

If anything should go wrong
I can use them as human shields.

LECTURER ON RECORDING:
For most of human history,

<i>time was believed to be
an objective part of reality.</i>

<i>But with the contributions
of immanuel Kant,</i>

<i>science and philosophy charted-</i>

When I said you should make a playlist
for the road trip, I meant music.

This is better than music.
This is a lecture on non-linear time.

Sounds like it's just on regular time.

Yes, but I put it on shuffle.

This is nice.

The four of us
haven't taken a trip like this

since Leonard's bachelor party.

And now here we are for Sheldon's.

(STAMMERING) Leonard...

As Sheldon's best man,

I need to inform you
that this is not a bachelor party.

And tell them why.

Because you're a tiresome scold.

No. It's because a bachelor party is
typically a hedonistic blow-out

where no pleasures
of the flesh are denied.

I'm not interested in that.

How is that not exactly what I said?

Okay, now, I promised Sheldon things
weren't gonna get too crazy tonight.

Should I be worried?

Just about who you're marrying.
(CLEARING THROAT)

Just come on.

Welcome to your bachelorette party!

(GASPING)

(UNSURELY) Oh.

It's a quilting bee!

My bachelorette party's a quilting bee!
(LAUGHING UNSURELY)

Isn't it perfect?

Yeah, instead of oiled-up strippers
and sex toys we thought,

"What does Amy like?"

Amy likes a quilting bee.

RAJ: Well, this place is creepy.

SHELDON: Why?

Did you see his vegetable garden?
Heirloom tomatoes in April.

creepy-

Okay, listen. Doctor Wolcott
is a brilliant topologist,

we need to set some ground rules
so that you don't embarrass me.

No magic. No whining. You, just no.

Hey...

How come he gets to whine?

Doctor Wolcott. Doctor Wolcott.
Doctor Wolcott.

(LOCKS UNLOCKING)

(MORE LOCKS UNLOCKING)

That's a lot of locks.

That's a lot of knocks.
They're made for each other.

Doctor Wolcott.

Doctor Cooper. Uh, who are these people?

Oh, these are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.

Oh, letter? I didn't get a letter.

Oh, that's because
ljust sent it this morning,

so score one for linear time.

Well, um, I don't normally
allow strangers into my house.

But when you do,
you let them out, right?

Doctor Cooper, if you can promise me

these men share
your intellect and academic rigor,

yeah, I suppose they can join us.

You guys might need to wait in the car.

Well, let me show you around.

This is the chair
where I do most of my thinking.

My thinking about work.

Now, my thinking about people
who have wronged me, I do over there.

I've always said that
I should get a grudge chair.

Leonard, have I not always said that?

You have, but you were worried
you'd spend too much time in it.

Well... That is a real concern.

Oh, my God, this tomato is amazing!
I can eat it like an apple.

My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.

The look on your face. (GIGGLING)

It's a sort of grin,
you wanna know what kind?

So, Doctor Wolcott,

in your letter you said you had
a new mathematical approach

that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory.

Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

But, before we get started,

lam going to need
to collect everybody's phones.

- Oh.
- LEONARD: Why?

Because they are
little listening devices, aren't they?

Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.

Yeah, what happened to the good old days

where if someone
wanted to steal your work

they had to hire a prostitute
to seduce you?

Who told you about that?

Just making a joke.

Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.

All right, now, you're probably going to
want to start with this notebook here.

- Oh.
- Here we are.

Oh, my. on. (CHUCKLING)

Um, no offense, Doctor Wolcott,
but I'm not sure this makes any sense.

That's because
I've written it all backwards.

You- Wow.

That's "wow" backwards.

You... Um, I still don't get it.

Well, plus, the numbers are letters
and letters are numbers.

(INHALING) Oh.

I love him.

Are you having fun?

Yeah, ljust, uh,
finished sewing this top-to-bottom,

and now
I'm going to sew it side-to-side.

- Pace yourself.
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

- Some more tea?
- Oh, lovely.

Oh!

Seriously? What the hell?

- Huh?
- What?

This is my bachelorette party,
tea and quilts?

Well, you said
you didn't want anything crazy.

Yes, but I said it like,
"I don't want anything crazy,"

which clearly means
I wanted something crazy.

I mean,
is this how boring you think I am?

Penny, she asked you a question.

Of course not.

So, you thought that
I would like quilting?

Well, don't you?

Of course, I like quilting,
it's the slowest way to make a blanket.

But this is my bachelorette party.

It's supposed to be fun and wild
and full of bad decisions.

Hey, we can make bad decisions.

Yeah, she had two kids back-to-back
and I thought you'd like this,

so we're off to a good start.

Come on, let's go somewhere we can do
body shots off shirtless bartenders.

Yes.

Oh, I don't know,
that might be too much.

All right, you know what, why don't
we stay home and have a little wine-

What are you not getting about this?

Doctor Wolcott,
your work on time is revolutionary.

I would say thank you,
but in my theory of time

you've already
called my work revolutionary,

I've already thanked you,

and I hate repeating myself,
so let's move on.

Wait a minute. Are you saying

that time has multiple dimensions,
the same as space?

No, no. I'm not saying it,
the math is saying it.

Though, it is the math that I invented,
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.

You understanding any of this?

I haven't understood anything
since poop-tomato.

My goodness, this is incredible.

See, I... I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits into all this

and that's where I think that you and I
could be of help to each other.

Thank you, I'd be honored.

All right. Allow me to
show you my most recent journal.

Sheldon's right,
this guy... This guy's brilliant.

Yeah, I mean, he's a little kooky,

but a mind that can reconceptualize time

probably has a reason
for keeping a jar of toenail clippings

that we just don't understand.

I could spend months up here
just going through his math.

You know, I think Sheldon might.

Great, who's gonna tell Amy

we lost her fiancÃ©
to a mad man in the mountains?

Hey, I drove.

This is so exciting.
Can we do a body shot?

I've always wanted to do a body shot.
Also, what's a body shot?

It's when you take a drink
out of a stranger's belly button.

Oh, no thanks.

What if they have an outie?
Does it just spill everywhere?

Okay, look, we've got all night.
Let's just take it easy-

I'm getting married!

(CHEERING)

Here you go, first round's on the house.

- Ooh.
- Hey, there. Do you do body shots?

Oh. She said she didn't want one-

Mind your business.

Cheers! (WHOOPING)

Amy? Amy? Should we get her home?

Why? She's sound asleep
and we have sliders coming.

One more round.

So, how would this work
in the context of a singularity?

Yes, that's a tricky bit to explain.

I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.

Oh, and how! You never
forget your first group theory.

Listen, I'm going to put
on a pot of coffee,

because there's a
lot of math to go through.

And he said he didn't
want a wild bachelor party.

Excuse me?

Oh, Sheldon is getting married
in a month.

Oh, congratulations.
Yeah, I'm a married man myself.

Oh, really? ls she here?

And alive?

And... And can people
other than you see her?

She lives in Munich.
It's a perfect marriage.

We focus on our work and send each other
cards every year on our birthdays.

Wait, what... What month is it?

- Uh, April.
- Most years.

The point is we give each other space.

I give her Europe,
she gives me South America,

that's where she thinks I'm living.

Oh, I... I've never considered
a long distance marriage.

Well, listen,
if you want to be a great scientist

you can't afford to be distracted.

Hey, where are my manners?
You fellows must be hungry.

- Do you like rabbit?
- Yeah. Sure.

- Sounds good.
- Okay.

But can you tell the
difference between rabbit and squirrel?

- No. Don't think so.
- Probably not.

Great, we're having rabbit.

Be right back.

It's amazing how much he's accomplished

by isolating himself from
the distractions of day-to-day life.

Okay, please don't tell me
you wanna live like this.

See, that's the strange thing, I don't.

What is wrong with me?
Why don't I want this?

Look how cool it all is.

Nothing is wrong with you.

You have friends, you have a fiancÃ©e.
You have a full life.

You know what? You're right.

Thank you for bringing me up here.

But I think I'm ready to go home now.

Really? You don't want to stay
for dinner and talk more science?

No, no, we better go. I miss Amy.
And my phone.

(GUN FIRING)

Also, I'm from Texas

and I can taste the difference
between rabbit and squirrel.

(TV PLAYING MUSIC)

Whoa... Huh?

- Oh, look who's back.
- There she is.

What happened? How did we get here?

You don't remember anything?

I remember taking some shots
and then... That's it.

Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?

You kinda did.

At my own bachelorette party?
I'm so lame.

Oh, you didn't pass out
before you did all kinds of fun stuff.

What did I do?

(INCREDULOUSLY) What did you do?

(IN NORMAL VOICE) What did she do?

Um, well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?

- I did that?
- Yeah, you did.

Mmm.

But I don't know how to Riverdance.

Didn't stop you from
teaching all those shirtless firemen.

I saw shirtless firemen?

Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.

Did I flash anybody?

How about "everybody"?

I can't believe it, I'm so embarrassed.
You didn't take any pictures, did you?

Oh, no, we would never do that to you.

Yeah, but if there were pictures,
they would be (SINGSONG) crazy.

- You guys are good friends.
- PENNY: Mmm.

(IRISH FIDDLE MUSIC PLAYING)

Dinner!

Guys?

I can't believe they left
without saying goodbye.

Wait a minute,
what if they stole my work?

Wait a minute,
what if they were never here at all?

Wait a minute,

what if they haven't gotten here yet
but they're on their way?

I'd better tidy up.

Hello.

Welcome back. How did it go?

Doctor Wolcott's theories of time

might save
my new interpretation of string theory.

Well, that's exciting.

Yeah, it is.
How was your bachelorette party?

Well, I was in a bar
and I saw some shirtless men.

They were firemen
and they fought over me.

But, Penny and Bernadette
got me out of there

before the victor got my spoils.

I see.

What's the matter? You look glum.

Amy, would you still love me
if I wasn't who you thought I was?

What are you talking about?

Well, what if it turns out
I'm not the single-minded,

science-obsessed recluse

who puts his work
above everything and everybody else

that you fell in love with?

What if I'm not the straight-laced,

buttoned-up,
quilting queen you thought I was?

What if I'm a Riverdancing wild woman?

I'd still love you.

I'd still love you, too.

Do you really know how to Riverdance?

You tell me.

I'm the only man you do that for.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

What're you doing?

Pigeon check for Sheldon.

North side's all clear.

Great. Let's look at some planets.

Hey, Why'd you lug your telescope
all the way over here?

Leonard has one in our apartment.

(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

Might as well hold my hand up like this
and squint.

I don't know, it seemed pretty good.

You know, once when the cable went out

I watched an entire episode of

The Bachelor on the TV
across the street.

This one's more of a professional model.

So was the girl he picked!

This baby's got a 10-inch diameter
with F-10 ACF optics.

And tonight,
Mercury is at its highest elongation.

It makes far away things seem close,
and Mercury is a planet.

I know Mercury is a planet.
But the other thing was helpful.

Oh, look at that.
Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store.

What did he say?

"Next time you're in Pasadena,
check out The Comic Center.

"Great vibe, old school,
the owner really knows his stuff."

Isn't that amazing?

Well, it's no Sandman

but I guess we can't expect everything
he writes to be a masterpiece.

When was he in your store?

I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

Obviously vibranium
is the most powerful metal in comics.

More powerful than adamantium?

Mmm. He's right, Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell, need I go on?

You don't need to,
but you probably will.

What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?

Good point. Strong as a metal
and fierce as a fashion choice.

You know,
Thor's hammer is pretty powerful,

and in the comics
it's made out of enchanted uru.

Yeah. I think it's the enchantment
that's powerful

and not the Uru, but thanks for playing.

Oh, man! I can't believe Neil Gaiman
came in and we weren't even there.

No.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Can you see Mercury? Can you see it?

One second.

You know the
Greek version of Mercury, Hermes,

was worshiped in Athens by the
carving of giant wooden phalluses.

Please, Amy, get your mind
out of the ancient Athenian gutter.

Got another follower, I'm blowing up.

- Great, how many does that make?
- High double digits.

- The nineties?
- Mid double digits.

Hey, uh, Penny,
you wanna check this out?

Yeah. Sure.

All right. Just look through here

and if you wanna take a picture
just push that button.

Okay. Oh, what is that?

Is it Mercury?
I'm really jonesing for Mercury.

I think it's a little early
for Mercury to be visible yet.

Playing hard to get.
I like that in a planet.

No, there's something fuzzy.

Is it your teen years?

No. Yes. Shut up. Look, I--
No really, I think I see something.

Well, it could just be your eyelash.

It's not an eyelash.

Okay, well, take a picture. Let's see.

Okay. Here.

Hmm.

- I do see something.
- Told ya.

- What is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it's a comet.

That would be so cool.

You guys wanna see a real star,
look over here.

What?

I just got retweeted by
Patton 0swalt's brother.

So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

Neil Gaiman, Nicholas Cage,
Natalie Portman, the list goes on.

They all come here?

Unless I'm lying.

Who are all these people?
What- Wait is this a flash mob?

Are they dancing?

I don't know what
today's dancing looks like.

Hey, guys. That tweet actually
got people to come in. Isn't that great?

No. I like the way the store was before.

You mean empty and sad?

Yes, it was perfect.

Like a funeral home
that sells Pokemon cards.

What am I supposed to do now if
I wanna hang out and read a <i>comic</i> book?

Go sit on the couch.

A... Next to a stranger?

I say, if I'm gonna sit,
read and ignore a woman,

it's gonna be my fiancÃ©e.

Why're you being such a baby
about the crowds?

You go to Comic Con.

You- I'm sorry. You're comparing
this place to Comic Con?

What- Can I go to the bathroom here,

next to a Wookiee
who got his zipper stuck in his fur?

Wow, we go to Comic Con
for different reasons.

You know... Just...

Get me a copy of Action <i>Comics</i> #1,000,
and I'll be on my way.

Sorry, all out.

Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

Oh, so I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

Well, it wasn't. But make me an offer.

(PHONE CHIMING)

- Who is that?
- Sheldon.

- Who's he mad at?
- Neil Gaiman.

- Who's that?
- Not us.

Oh, great.

- Guys.
- Hey.

- Hi.
- So guess what.

That indeed was a comet last night,

and it turns out
no one's seen it before.

- Wow!
- What? Really?

Look at that,
ljust discovered a comet. Oh!

What do you mean, you discovered it?

Well, I'm the one who saw it.

In my telescope, that I positioned.
All you did was look into it.

You both discovered it.

You can put both your names
on the registration form.

- Actually we can't.
- Why not?

Because when I filled it out,

it asked for name of discoverer
and I put Rajesh Koothrappali,

because, because that's who I am
and that's what I did.

Are you kidding me?

Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

No he didn't,
he thought it was an eyelash.

And you thought it was a fuzzy streak.

I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

Yeah. The thing I saw first.

I honestly don't think that
that qualifies as a discovery.

But I took the picture.

Because I told you to.

Like, if a monkey took the picture,
did it discover the comet?

Excuse me?

He didn't mean monkey.

Get the hell out of my apartment!

She didn't mean that-

Actually, I think she did,
you should go.

- You look great.
- Thanks.

Would you believe this is actually
a dress from before I was pregnant?

Well, it's not a competition
but I wore this suit to my Bar Mitzvah.

Where's Stuart? I told him
we had a 6:30 reservation.

I don't know. I'll call him.

(PHONE RINGING)

Comic Center,
where the real superhero is you.

Stuart, you're supposed
to be babysitting.

Oh, shoot! That was tonight.
I forgot, the store's been really busy.

Well, when can you get here?

Um, I don't think I can. Listen to this.

I was ringing up a customer
and I heard someone say,

"Hey, there's a line,"
and I looked, and there was.

Come on. You can't do this to us.

I am really sorry,
I will make it up to you.

But it won't be with
a Val Kilmer Batman figurine

because some
sucker's buying that right now.

(CHUCKLING)

Not you, this is great.

He says he has to work.

Oh, it's okay, we can have
date night another night.

But you got all dressed up.

We were supposed to
have dinner and romance.

We'll just have to divide and conquer.

I'll go to dinner and you can stay home
with the internet and have romance.

Okay, look, I googled it.

I took the picture,
so it's my discovery.

He stole my comet.

I know. But on the other hand,
do you really care?

Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

People take one look at me and assume
I don't know what I'm talking about.

Mmm, I'm sure that's not true.

I'm sorry, are you saying
I don't know what I'm talking about?

No, I'm not saying anything ever again.

Look, I'm serious.

The other day at work,
I had this great idea.

But no one was listening to me,

and then five minutes later
Paul said the same thing

and they practically
carried him around the room.

Oh, well, what was it?

Well, CPK for lunch
but that's just one example.

It also happens with all the doctors
I have to deal with,

you know, they're so condescending.

I'm so sick of letting this stuff slide.
I found that comet.

Why shall I let Raj say he found it?

I know you're right but he is our friend
and this could be good for his career.

Wait. So you agree with me
but he still gets his way?

There you go. Everybody wins.

My God, you're such a people pleaser.
You can't stand making anyone angry.

Why would I want to make anyone angry?

'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

Oh, I am on your side.

Hey, let's not forget
who you're really mad at here.

Raj. Oh and Paul. Paul sucks, right?

But don't tell him I said that.

Hey, Howard. Did you see the-

(EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)

I'm over here, Sheldon.

Oh! That was a close one.
I almost went home with that guy.

You doing okay? Do we need to go?

No, I'm fine.

I admit, all these people
did take me by surprise at first.

But I've learnt that
I can accept change.

Since when?

I managed it when
Amy switched her shampoo

from Prell to Prell for oily hair.

Although, I do miss the way her head
used to slide off the pillow.

- May I help you?
- Who are you?

Oh, I'm Denise.
The new assistant manager.

Nope.

Can you believe it?

In the past decade I have spent
thousands of dollars in that store.

And this is the thanks I get.

You're right, I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

He gave me a mug.
What do you think I'm drinking out of?

Oh, do you even pay attention?

Honestly, less and less.

Amy, the comic book store is like

my version of the country
in <i>Black</i> Panther.

Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get
really offensive to certain groups.

But go on.

The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem

and they wanted to keep it that way

because they knew
if they opened it up to the world,

everything that was special about it
would get ruined.

- Are you done?
- Yes.

(SIGHING IN RELIEF) Okay! That both
made sense and wasn't offensive.

And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

There we go.

Yep. No.

I'm not annoyed that she's a woman.
I'm annoyed and she's a woman.

No, I get that.
I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.

It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes

and I can count on his discretion

if I pick up the occasional back issue
of Superman's pal, Jimmy Olsen.

Which I don't.

Well, don't think of her as a stranger.

Just think of her as a friend
you haven't berated,

lectured or condescended to yet.

I hadn't thought of it that way.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

I mean, you're wise
and you smell like books.

You really are the whole package.

Raj, just help me out.

Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

Well, I'm sorry she's upset.
But she didn't discover it.

Come on. You know she was a part of it.
Just add her name to the registration.

But I already told everyone at work
that I did it.

My boss was so excited
he started calling me Captain Comet,

which is better than
his last nickname for me, Doctor Donuts,

because one time I had two donuts.
And two times I had three donuts.

I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

I... I can't do that.

Sure you can.
Just pretend it's two or three donuts.

You don't understand, Leonard,
I need this.

My last big discovery was
if you press your upper lip hard enough,

you can block a sneeze.

I told you that.

This is all my fault.
I brought this upon myself.

I'm a bad scientist.
I'm a selfish person.

No, no, don't get upset.
You're not a bad person.

Just let me talk to Penny.
I'm sure I can make her understand.

Thank you.
You're a good friend, Leonard.

(SIGHING) I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

Just look at her, over there.

She just started and
she gets to put up "Staff Picks."

I've been coming here over ten years,
I still can't put up "Sheldon Dislikes."

I talked to her yesterday,
she really seems to know her stuff.

Challenge accepted.

That is not what that was.

Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could recommend something.

Oh, sure.
You wanna tell me what you like?

I would not.

All right, well you're wearing
a Green Lantern shirt

so I'm guessing you're a DC fan,

although that's from the Alan Scott era

<i>so</i> you're probably not super
into the current run.

How would you
feel about an alternate history

where World War One was fought
with dragons and magic?

That's what I wanted the theme
of my tenth birthday party to be.

Here. Check this out,
it's by Kurt Busiek.

You know, if you're interested
in alternate histories,

Neil Gaiman wrote one called <i>1602.</i>

I'm sorry,
we're in the middle of something here.

It is pretty good, actually.

He takes the Marvel superheroes and
he puts them into Elizabethan England.

Let me guess, everyone thinks
the X-Men are the witches?

Yeah.

Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

return it,
and I'll give you your money back.

Just don't tell Stuart.

Stuart who?

Hey, where have you been?

(SIGHING) I went to yell at Raj.

And? ls he gonna give me back my comet?

Interesting thing.

Did you cave?

Maybe I did, or... Maybe I did.

But I did realize something.

(STAMMERS) I don't need
to fight your battles.

You, you are a strong
and independent woman,

you have your own voice.

And to quote another strong woman,

Katy Perry,
"It's time to hear you roar."

Did you just think of that
on your way home?

What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

But it doesn't mean it's not true.

Well, you make a good point.
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

I know I don't say it enough,
but you go, girl.

That was enough.

What's all this?

Well, we missed our date night
and Stuart's working again.

So, I thought we could have
a date night here at home.

Why, that's so sweet.

Oh, so, is that really
what you're wearing to our date night?

Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

I can wear nothing.

You might wanna hold off on that.
We're starting with soup.

Hey!

Wha- I thought you were
working late again.

I was but Denise has got it covered.

Oh, the funniest thing happened today.

You know, the receipt tape
in the cash register, it ran out.

(CHUCKLING) I didn't even know
it could do that.

You know,
we were just sitting down to dinner.

Oh! Perfect timing. I'll go wash up.

There goes date night.

Are you kidding? Stuart's here,
get your purse, we're going out.

What about the dinner you made?

Right. Well, hey, Stuart!

That can of soup sittin' by the stove,
that's for you.

You made canned soup for date night?

And you wore sweat pants. Let's go.

Oh, and it turns out
Denise is also really excited

for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man

because he was her
favorite Spider-Man writer too.

How about that?

Oh, and guess who goes to
art school right here in Pasadena?

Hmm, I don't know. Denise?

You're a good guesser, Amy.
Not as good as Denise though.

She thought
I would like this comic, Arrowsmith,

and she was right.

Well, was the store crowded?
I bet it was, I know you hate that.

Yeah, It was.
But if it weren't for the crowds

Stuart never would have hired Denise,
and she's the best.

- You must be Denise.
- Oh, yeah. How can I help you?

I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancÃ©e.

Oh. I gotta be honest,

I wasn't a hundred percent sure
you were real.

Oh, I am.

And I heard you and Sheldon had

a great time today
talking about comic books.

We did.

Great, here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna teach me how to do that.

- Do what?
- Pretend to like comic books.

Oh, no. I actually like comic books.

All right, let's not
get hung up on semantics,

it's late, we got a lot of work to do.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

I'm sorry.

I haven't even said anything yet.

I know but I heard
your footsteps coming up the stairs

and they sounded angry.

They are angry. I'm mad at you.

And you have every right to be.

Okay. I was... I was being a jerk.

We did this together
and I hogged all of the credit.

And after you've been
such a good friend to me over the years.

Like, I wouldn't even be able to
talk to women if it wasn't for you.

So... so, I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

Thank you.

Even if it's
professionally embarrassing, you know.

Or maybe put me on thin ice at work.

I may lose my funding.
Still, uh, still wanna make this right.

Good. Bye.

That worked way better with Leonard.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Why are you reading a comic book?

Denise recommended it to me.

<i>It's</i> the <i>Rebirth Omnibus.</i>

She thought it would be a good
entry point for me into the DC universe.

And I have to say,
I really do like how-

You know, Amy... Amy, I've talked
a lot about comic books lately.

Can we talk about something else?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

English - SDH

What are you doing?

The light is red, so I came to a stop.

You're in a stolen cop car
with a dead hooker in the trunk.

You don't have to obey traffic laws.

I know I don't have to.

The fun is choosing to.

Hey. Missed you guys
at the faculty mixer.

Oh, you should have been there.
Dessert was bananas.

Sorry, that was misleading.

The dessert was pie,
but the pie was bananas.

Actually, the pie was cherry,

but the taste of the pie was bananas.

Those mixers are such
a waste of University money.

If they spend less money

on frivolous nonsense and more money
on science, we'd all be better off.

You're a theoretical physicist.

What more do you need
than an office and a white board?

Someday my new formulas
on entropy decrease

due to quantum de-coherence
will need to be tested

and that will require funding.

Your theories are pretty abstract.

I wouldn't even know how to design
an experiment to prove them.

Says the experimental physicist.

Well, I know a place the University
can make some cuts.

Bye, Leonard.

One second, he's got a point.

In order to corroborate
your string theory research,

you'd have to create a black hole.

Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?

Well, perhaps.

But we'd all go to the grave
knowing I was right.

I guess you could create
a contained microscopic black hole.

Huh!

Interesting.

Welcome back, Leonard.

Sorry, you're out.

What did I do?

Exactly.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Ooh! This one's pretty.

Mmm, my mother wouldn't approve.
Shows too much clavicle.

She calls it "the bosom's welcome mat."

I can't wait to get drunk

and pick a fight with her
at your wedding.

It's just so hard to tell
what will look good on me.

No, this is just to give you ideas,
you know.

Do you want something
simple and elegant?

Do you want a train-

Oh! We're talking about trains.

Not the kind of trains you like.

Oh, I like all kinds of trains.

Steam, diesel, coal, elevated, bullet.

Now, I defy you
to name a train that I don't like.

The kind on the back of a wedding dress?

I did not see that coming, good job.

Although, while we're on
the subject of fashion,

lam asking the University
for some funding tomorrow.

What should I wear?

I've got a push-up bra I can loan you
that always gets me free drinks.

How much money are you asking for?

$500 million.

Then I'd go no bra.

What do you need that kind of money for?

I have figured out
an experimental design

that may corroborate
my latest thinking on string theory.

I just need 2,148 high-power lasers

to compress 20 mg of gold
into a small enough volume

to make a microscopic black hole.

- Just nod.
- Mmm.

Sheldon, they're not gonna give you
half a billion dollars.

I mean, they won't even
give me that much

and I keep promising I can make
people's brains grow younger.

Can you?

(WHISPERS) No.

But I need it.

It's the only way
to settle the contradictions

between gravity and quantum mechanics.

Well, it's too much money,
you can't ask for that all at once.

Well, what if I ask for it
in six easy installments

<i>of $%3,333,333.33'?</i>

Okay, what if you asked for $20 million?

Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to do science,

not hire Lady Gaga
to come to my birthday.

Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?

Presumably the wife of Lord Gaga.

Sheldon, you know, Penny's got a point.

Sometimes when you want
something big from someone,

you gotta to be careful
not to scare them away, you know.

You've gotta start small
and build up slowly,

even if it takes eight years.

Eight long years.

That's oddly specific.

Have you ever done that?

Nope.

So, with this level of high-power
laser array, we would actually be able

to solve the black hole information
paradox once and for all.

That's impressive, and how much funding
were you looking for?

$20 million.

Really? You think you can build that
for $20 million?

Not a chance.

I'm sorry,
then why are you asking me for it?

Because once you've spent $20 million,

you're much more likely
to give me an additional $50.

So actually what you're saying is
with $70 million you can build this.

I see why you'd think that, but no.

You can't go to the board of trustees

and say you gave Sheldon Cooper
$70 million

and have nothing to show for it.

No. The only way you'd be
able to save face is to double down.

- So $140?
- And then double again.

$280?

And then good news, not quite,
double again.

So, what do you say? We have a deal?

- He said no?
- No.

That's only a two-letter word.
You're gonna have to double down.

I'm sorry, Sheldon,

but this sort of thing happens.

Higgs had to wait almost 50 years
before they built a collider

big enough to prove his theory.

50 years?

But I want to play with it now.

You just have to wait
for science to catch up,

or technology to get cheaper.

Think about DVD players,
they used to cost like $1,000,

but just the other day
I used one to smash a bug.

Yeah, you just have to be patient.

But what if while I'm being patient
someone more relentless than me

badgers their university
into giving them money?

If there's someone more relentless
than you, I'd like to meet them.

I would not.

I'm not waiting
for the University to come around.

I'll find another way
to raise the money.

Ooh! If it's one of those booths
where we can throw a pie at you

I'm in for, like, 20 bucks.

Forty bucks if I can throw a DVD player.

Would you like some champagne?

- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

Sure.

This is nice.

What, helping Amy find a dress
or day-drinking?

It's just nice, okay.

What do you think?

Amy, oh, my God.

You look so beautiful.

I feel beautiful.

And look, both clavicles.
Take that, Mom.

You know what they say,
if got 'em flaunt 'em.

Is it possible that
the very first dress is the dress?

No. Don't be silly, you can't buy
the first dress you try on.

That'd be like marrying
the first guy that you...

You can't buy
the first dress you try on.

Little finger sandwiches, too.
This place is amazing.

Interesting thing
about finger sandwiches,

you put enough of them together,
you've got a sandwich.

AMY: Guys, we have a problem.

- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

I look amazing in all of these dresses!

Look at your waist,
where you been hiding that thing?

Bernadette, stop. (CHUCKLES)

Penny, you say something nice now.

Boy, you know,
when Sheldon sees you in that dress,

he's gonna wanna
methodically take it off, fold it up,

carefully place it in a storage box,
label it, and then ravish you.

Should I try on some more?

Are you having fun?

Am I having fun being beautiful?
Of course I am!

All right, keep going.

AMY: This is it.

This is the one.

Do you love it?

Do you?

I do.

Wow.

Also wow.

- Hello, Leonard.
- Hi.

Are you doing anything?

No, I'm just sitting here at my desk
typing on my computer for nothing.

That was my guess,
but I didn't want to assume.

Can you help me
shoot my kick-starter video?

Do you really think people are gonna
give you half a billion dollars?

Of course not, but if I can raise enough
seed money to show that I'm serious,

I should be able to attract
some major investors.

And look at the cool incentives
I'm offering.

"For $50,000, I will examine your diet

"and create a customized
bathroom schedule."

That's fitting,
50 grand down the toilet.

How about this. "For $100,000

"I will design the flag of your house
or apartment,

"and for $1 million

"I will come over and tell you
what's wrong with you."

Aw! All these years
I've been getting that for free.

Don't be smug, Leonard.

That's one of things
that's wrong with you.

Well, that was a successful trip.

Yes.

Amy found a dress that she liked.

She sure did.

She found a dress that looked like...

Like it made her happy.

She did look happy.
I mean, her face was just glowing, so...

Yeah, we should make sure

the photographer knows to just
really get in there.

So, we agree it's awful?

That dress should be set on fire.

Should we say something?

No, we can't.

Don't you think she brought us with her
because she wants our honest opinion?

No one wants that.

I do.

No, ya don't.

I don't want her to look back
and think she made some awful mistake.

You mean, like your dumb
Cookie Monster tattoo?

See, was that fun?

Someone's gonna say something
and it should be us now

instead of everyone at her wedding.

Okay, but as long as we do it gently.

And together.

What about my dress?

Don't you like it?

- I don't.
- It's beautiful.

Hey, Stuart,
I'd like to sell some comic books.

Oh! I know all about that.
Step one is flunk out of art school.

Why are you selling them?

The University is refusing
to fund my experiment,

<i>so</i> I need to raise money
and do it on my own.

How much do you need?

For a start,
I'm trying to raise $500,000.

Well, I hope you have that rare Superman
printed on the skin of actual Superman.

I know you're making a joke,

but I really do have
some valuable issues in here.

And this is just the first box of many.

All right, let's see what you got.

Is this a complete run
of Todd McFarlane's Spawn?

(GASPS)

Yes.

Ooh! Look at this, Giant-Size <i>X-Men</i> #1,

Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.

Yeah, I know what it is.

I'm the one who bought it, bagged it,
boarded it and taped it shut

while wearing white cotton gloves.

Okay, well, I... You know, I'm gonna
have to open it to assess its condition.

(SIGHS)
Just be gentle,

It's never felt
the touch of a man before.

You don't seem like
you really want to sell these.

Of course I don't wanna sell these.

These are all important to me,

but not as important as science.

And if this is the sacrifice
I need to make, then so be it.

Okay, why don't you
leave these here with me

and I'll price them out for you?

Is it okay if I stand here and watch?

Sure.

If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.

Hey, I can't believe
you just threw me under the bus.

I know, right? That was crazy.

Do you know how that makes me look?

That's an easy one, bad.

Why didn't you tell her
that you don't like the dress either?

What happened to our united front?

I'm sorry,
is this your first day being a girl?

Oh! Did your mom pack your lunch?

Of course not.

Do you know how much it costs
to pack a tuna fish sandwich in dry ice

and overnight it from Texas?

Well, I do, and my mother says
it's too expensive.

- I like tuna fish.
- Do you want it?

I'll sell it to you for $5,000.

How's the fundraising going?

That depends. Raj, was that a yes?

- No.
- It's going badly.

How much have you raised?

Well, with my kick-starter campaign,

Selling my collectibles
and the money in my bank account,

about $65,000.

Wow! That's a lot.

Not enough.

It's so frustrating
that science should be held hostage

to the almighty dollar.

Don't give up,
you'll find that money somewhere.

- You really think so?
- No, but it's good that he has a hobby.

You ever thought of going to Vegas?

Can you be more specific?

Las Vegas.

Oh! You mean gambling?

Oh, well that's not the worst idea.

Um, it is the worst idea,

and I'm including the year
that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.

Ordinary people can't beat a casino,

but mathematicians and scientists,
they do it all the time.

A group of students from MIT
took Las Vegas for millions

and that's MIT.

Howard went there.

Come on, Sheldon, I'll give you a ride
out to the desert right now.

No one is going to Vegas.

We weren't gonna make it to Vegas.

Hi, do you have a minute?

Depends, is what I'm wearing okay
or should I go change first?

Look, I'm sorry.

I never should've said
I didn't like your dress.

It's your wedding and all that matters
is that you feel beautiful.

Thank you.

So, are we good?

No. We're not good, you ruined my dress.

What? ljust said you should wear it.

Well, I can't wear it now.

I mean, I know you hate it.
That's all I'm gonna be thinking about.

No, I don't hate it.

I asked if you liked it and you said no.

There is a lot of room
between "don't like" and "hate."

You know, it's where you find
rice pudding and jazz.

Anyway, who cares what I think?

I do.

You're the coolest, prettiest,
best-dressed person in my life.

Okay, that would be flattering, except
I know all the people in your life.

Look, Amy, I don't know what to say.

I think I got stuck on the fact

that it's not a dress I would choose,
but it shouldn't be.

You know, it's your dress.

I mean, hey, would you marry Leonard?

Ew!

Okay, a simple "no"
would've been fine, but...

You see my point?

That we're different people.

Yes.

And from now on I'm gonna remember
that this wedding is all about you.

I appreciate that.

You're a good maid of honor.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

It's Bernadette. Hello?

I feel bad about
hanging Penny out to dry.

The truth is,
I don't like the dress either.

Are you kidding me?
Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress.

She is the worst.

Anyone seen Sheldon?

Last time I saw Sheldon
was this morning.

Careful, don't say his name
a third time.

You don't think
he actually went to Las Vegas, do you?

(ROULETTE CLICKING)

Five red.

(DIGITAL BEEPING)

This is it.

- Is everything okay, sir?
- Oh! Hi.

It's better than okay.

I am a physicist and I've been
observing this wheel for hours

and running a chi-square analysis,
which is how I know

that the ball is far more likely
to land on 32, 17 or five.

So if you could hold off
on replacing this wheel,

I'd like to make several large bets.

Well, good for you. Pelican.

What's pelican?

Sir, would you come with us?

No, I have to place my bet first.
This is for science.

- Seventeen black.
- No!

No!

Guess who's no longer allowed
to set foot in...

(GASPS) Wow!

You look beautiful.

Really?

'Cause I was gonna return it.

Why would you return it?

You look like a pile of swans.

I'm so glad you like it,

'cause it's gonna be my wedding dress.

I can't wait to marry you.

Why do you smell like smoke?

I was in Vegas.

Vegas?

Oh! I'm sorry. Las Vegas.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

English - SDH

That's not right.

No, that's so unreasonable.

Yeah, well,
if you're going to be like this

then I don't wanna talk to you
right now either.

Okay, I love you. Bye.

Amazon customer support?

No, my mother.

Guess who she's insisting
we invite to our wedding.

Jesus?

If only. My brother.

Wait a minute. You didn't invite
your brother to your own wedding?

He tormented me my whole childhood.

I don't think
I should reward that type of behavior

with a slice of wedding cake
in the shape of the Millennium Falcon.

Try again.

A slice of wedding cake
in the shape of a cake.

Look, he may have been mean to you
when you were kids,

but you're both grown men now.

That's right.

I'm a grown-up and if I don't wanna
invite him to my wedding then I won't.

- Okay.
- Except I have to,

'cause my mommy's making me.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, so each welcome bag
gets a schedule of events,

a map, and chocolate from me.

And from Sheldon, a bottle of Purell,

the number for Poison Control,

in case someone
accidentally drinks the Purell,

and a laminated table of elements

because the American school system
is a failure.

How many out-of-town guests
are there gonna be?

I'm actually not sure.

Turns out Sheldon
didn't invite his brother.

Um. Now it's starting
to sound like a wedding.

And his mom said she won't come
if his brother's not there.

Um! Now it's starting to sound
like a good wedding.

HOWARD: Hey, Bernie,

how do you know if someone has pink eye?

Um, their eye would be red, swollen,
and probably oozy.

Okay, thanks.

Both kids have pink eye.

Oh, no.

You stop right there!

I'm getting married in a week.
You are not giving me pink eye.

- I don't have pink eye.
- Hey, hey, hey.

Let's step away from the bride!

(SIGHS)
Okay. I'll go back upstairs.

Get in the shower and then
take those clothes and burn them.

Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes.

Ah, worth a shot.

So, am I gonna be, like, the only
single guy at Sheldon's wedding?

No, there will be
a lot of single people there.

Stuart, Amy's great-aunt...

Although, Stuart's already friended her
on Facebook so better move quick.

I got to find a date.

I don't wanna be that sad single friend
that everyone looks at with pity.

Oh!

(STUTTERS) I'm afraid that ship
may have sailed.

Leonard, you have a brother, right?

- Yes.
-ls he the worst?

Is he an unspeakable abomination?

Does the very thought of him
make your skin crawl?

He laughs at his own jokes,
but otherwise, he's okay.

Sheldon, what's going on?

I'm trying to invite
my stupid brother to my wedding,

and he's avoiding my calls.

You don't know he's avoiding your calls.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

<i>GEORGE: (OVER <i>PHONE) Hey, you've reached
George Cooper, please leave a message.</i>

<i>Unless this is Sheldon again,</i>

<i>in which case, please try me
on my other number, 1-800-suck-it.</i>

See?

And I know that's not a real number
because why would it be toll-free?

Sheldon, you tried.
What more could you have clone?

Hey, why didn't you invite him
in the first place?

You don't know what it was like
growing up with him.

I get it, I grew up
with lots of brothers.

My brother, Adoot, was especially mean.

Really? I've never heard you
mention Adoot.

Sure I have.

He's the one who left the door open
when we were kids,

and my pet mongoose ran away.

Stupid Adoot!

Look, short of getting on a plane
and flying there,

what does your mother expect you to do?

I kept saying no, how am I here?

Hey, did I tell you? I found a date.

- To the wedding?
- To coffee.

But if things go well,
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.

Aren't you worried it's a little intense

to ask someone you just met
to go to a wedding?

(EXHALES)
I'm running out of time.

(STUTTERS) Why can't there be a service

where you can just pay someone
to be your date for the evening?

Like an escort service?

No, no, no.
You wouldn't be paying for sex.

I mean, obviously if things went well
it could lead to sex,

but the money is for like,
you know, her time and companionship.

Oh! I get it.

An escort service.

Stop saying that.

Stop meaning it.

HOWARD: Hey, Raj, remember when you
borrowed my VR goggles the other day?

Yeah.

Probably shouldn't have done that.

So wait, your brother is Dr. Tire?

Yes, and apparently it only takes
half a semester of community college

to get that particular doctorate.

We passed three of these stores
on the way here.

Why did you say
he's just some loser who sells tires?

You're right, that was unfair.

He is a loser who sells more tires
than anyone in Texas.

Oh, excuse me,
we're looking for a Georgie Cooper.

One second, I'll check to see
if the doctor's in.

He is not a doctor.

Only one doctor here and it's me.

I'm also a doctor.

Do you wanna wait in the car?

I wanted to wait in California.

So, is this Georgie?

Yes.

And what is he even using
that stethoscope to listen to?

I don't know. Small leak?

All right, that makes sense.

What the hell are you doing here?

- Hello, Georgie.
- It's just George now.

Fine, George.

No, I don't like it. Georgie.

I see you haven't changed one bit.

Thank you. That is a nice thing to say.

Hey, I'm Leonard.
I'm here for no reason.

What do you want, Sheldon?

Why aren't you returning my phone calls?

You're supposed to be the smart one,
you figure it out.

He's not that kinda smart.
You might wanna give him a hint.

We haven't talked in over 10 years.

Now that you need something,

you think you can just
show up at my store?

Well, let's just drop everything
to accommodate Sheldon.

Nice try, but I'm not
a gullible little boy anymore.

I can recognize sarcasm.

Okay. You're right.
I'm sorry. Tell me what you need.

Your wish is my command.

That's better. Thank you.

(COMPUTER RINGING)

Oh, my God!

<i>Yeah, I got it too.</i>

You really can't keep
your hands off Howard, can you?

<i>I know, I have a problem.</i>

<i>ljust wanted to make sure
you and Amy didn't get it.</i>

Well, I didn't get it.

You infected me
a week before my wedding!

What am I supposed to do about this?

<i>Wear a veil?</i>

(LAUGHING)

That's not funny.

Look at what you've done to me!

Hey, could you just, like,
not touch my computer,

or maybe, like, anything else. ljust...

Oh! I don't wanna look like that
in your wedding photos.

There aren't gonna be
any wedding photos.

My fiancÃ©'s a germophobe.

If he finds out I'm contagious,
he'll never come back from Texas.

<i>What if we tell him
the theme of the wedding is Waking Dead</i>

<i>and this is our zombie makeup?</i>

That'll probably work.
We'll call that plan B.

Well, hmmm...

Turns out this is gonna
come in handy after all.

Hold up. I'm... I'm confused.

You didn't want me at your wedding.

But now that Mom won't come,
you want me there?

I know you don't hear this a lot,
but that is exactly right. Good job.

Not helping, Sheldon.

Listen here.

You want me at your wedding,
all you got to do is ask nicely.

(BREATH ES AND EXHALES HEAVILY)

- Georgie--
- George.

(GRUNTS)

I would like you at my wedding.

Thank you, Sheldon.

That is so nice to hear.

But I would rather swallow
a pregnant wildcat

and crap out a litter of kittens!

It is fitting that you got into tires,
because you are tiresome.

Sheldon, come on.

- Was that too mean?
- No, not too mean.

Not too good either.

No, Mother, that's not fair.

But he told...

Yes, ma'am.

But I said...

Yes, ma'am.

Goodbye.

What'd she say?

She's not getting in the middle of it,

because we "boys need to
work it out ourselves."

Well, maybe it's fine
if she doesn't come to the wedding.

I've got Amy now,

and she can do everything
a mom can do and more.

Say that to her on the wedding night,
really spice things up.

This is all Georgie's fault.

My whole childhood he was mean to me.

Sorry. I know what it's like
to live with a bully.

Your brother bullied you?

I was talking about Penny, but sure.

Once, when I was eight,

I was going to dress
as my favorite scientist for Halloween,

and Georgie threw my costume away.

I had to wear a sheet and go as a ghost.

Scared myself all night long.

Look, we don't fly out
until the morning.

Why don't I try and talk to him?
Give it one more shot?

All right.

But if he says, "Nerd says what,"
don't answer him.

- What?
- You are a lamb to the slaughter.

So, how was your date?

It was going well
until my eye dripped in her latte.

We're so sorry we ruined your date.

Oh! Boo-hoo!

I mean, his date got ruined.

I'm about to get married and look at me.

Looks like it's getting better.

Oh! Does it? Does it look like that
with your two clear eyes?

I'm sorry, are you mad
that I don't have pink eye?

- What do you think?
- ALL: Yes!

Uh-huh. Okay. Okay.
Listen, I hear you.

I know they're pricey,

but these are the Dallas Cowboys
of tires, okay?

And we're talking
the Troy Aikman Cowboys,

<i>not that pretty boy, Tony Rome.</i>

All right, good call.
You won't regret it.

- Boom!
-(LAUGHS)

Wow! That was impressive.

Yeah, well, it's easy
when you love your product,

<i>and hate Tony Rome.</i>

Yeah, that guy's...

I'm sorry, I don't know who that guy is.

If you're here about Sheldon's wedding,
don't bother.

Come on, I know
you two have your differences.

You mean pretty much
everything about us?

Well, not everything.

You're both tall,

you have the same last name...

Maybe I shouldn't have started this
like it was a list.

You have no idea
what you are talking about.

Ooh! There, that was very Sheldon.

Look, I'm... I'm sure
he was not the easiest brother to have,

but it wasn't easy for him either
with you picking on him all the time.

(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

Picking on him?
ls that what he told you?

Well, what about the time
you threw away his Halloween costume?

Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna dress
as some girl scientist.

Madame Curie?

I didn't know she was a madam.

Come on, he was still gonna get beat up
for wearing that dress.

Didn't you sit on his head
while he tried to watch Star Trek?

Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.

That is pretty hilarious.

Look, I mean, uh...

I always looked out for him at school,
I drove him everywhere,

I apologized to people when he was rude.

Yeah. I've done all that.

I've also removed all the red balloons
from his Lucky Charms,

because they weren't "lrish enough."

All right,
so you know what I'm talking about.

And has he ever thanked you?

Not in so many words...

Or any words.

Would it kill him to actually say it?

No.

No, it wouldn't kill him.

Leonard...

You know how I got the money
to open up my first store?

I busted my ass for it,

'cause all the extra money that we had
had to go to Sheldon,

so he could go to college,
and he could go study in Germany.

And do you know
what he's never said to me?

<i>Danke schfan?</i>

It's "thank you" in German.

Do you need me to sit on your head?

Nope.

After all my sacrifices,

guess which kid
my mom is the most proud of.

If it makes you feel any better,

my mom's most proud
of Sheldon too, so...

Leonard,

you want a beer?

Yeah, I would love a beer.

- There you go.
- Thanks. Can you open it for me?

- No. It's a twist-off.
- I know.

Hey, I got all the beads
to the other side.

It's not a puzzle, Penny.

Do you really wanna be touching that?

Do you know how many sick kids--

You know what?
Never mind, knock yourself out.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Bernadette says
they're checking the kids now.

You know,
maybe we didn't all need to come.

Hey, whatever kind of pink eye
their kids have, I have.

And I need to know.
And if it's viral, I'm screwed.

Maybe not.

You know, I know
it's not traditional wedding attire,

but how about a welder's mask?

If you know a welder
that could be your something borrowed.

Great news, it's bacterial.

- Yeah!
- Yes!

- What are you doing? Wash your hands!
- Not you.

Hello, room service.

I'm calling about the club sandwich
on your menu.

No, I don't want one.
ljust want you to spell it correctly.

Unless the "club"
is the Poor Typing Club.

Okay. Now let's discuss
this "15% gratooty."

Well, that was rude.

Someone just lost their gratooty.

(SIGHS)

Sheldon, you need to apologize
to your brother.

Rm sorry?

Yes, like that but nicer and that way.

- I have nothing to apologize for.
- Huh.

I told you this was a bad idea.

Sometimes you can't patch a tire,
you just got to buy a new one.

Actually, that's always the case.
Never patch, buy new.

While I appreciate
your folksy tire wisdom,

I don't appreciate
what you're putting Mom through.

What would you know about
what Mom's been through?

You were never home.

Yeah. This is good, get it all out.

- Not now.
- Shut up!

You went away to college after Dad died.

Who do you think
took care of everything?

Mom did.
Mom always took care of everything.

Mom was a mess.

Missy was a dumb teenager.
I had to look after both of them.

I talked to Mom all the time.

If she was upset,
she would have told me.

She was protecting you, you idiot,
just like everyone always does.

If things were bad,
then why didn't you tell me?

Because I was protecting you too.

You're my baby brother, Sheldon.

I know life has been hard for you,

but that don't mean
it's been easy for the rest of us.

I suppose I didn't think about
how it was for everyone else.

No, that's all right.

I know you didn't.
(SCOFFS)

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

And it would mean a lot to me
to have my big brother at my wedding.

I wouldn't miss it.

Is it me or did we just patch a tire?

He said "never patch."
Do you even listen?

(COMPUTER RINGING)

<i>Hell, how's it going?</i>

Really good.

Georgie's going to come to the wedding.

<i>Oh! That's great!</i>

Why aren't you looking at the camera?

<i>You know, I'm just working
on my peripheral vision.</i>

That is nonsense.

Your peripheral vision is fine.

Are those women's magazines making you
feel bad about yourself again?

Yep, that is what's happening.

I have told you before.

Those women are airbrushed,

to make it look like
they have good vision.

Hey, I was thinking,
now that you and your brother made up,

there's no reason to rush home.

<i>Maybe you and Leonard could...</i>

Could stay for...

Two to three more
fun-filled days there.

That's a great idea.

Hey, Leonard, good news.

We do have time to visit
the Museum of the American Railroad.

I'd say no, but what's the point?

You might not wanna get too close.

Pink eye.

Me, too!

- Bacterial?
- Yeah.

Same!

I know this is gonna sound crazy,

but would you be interested
in going to a wedding with me?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, Saturday is the big day.

A lot of people thought
this would never come.

I may have been one of those people.

I may have been one of those people.

- Wait, are we talking about the wedding?
- Yes.

Yeah, I was definitely
one of those people.

And yet, here we are. Now, we got
a lot of family coming in tomorrow.

I'm gonna need everyone's help.

Think of this as
one of your comic book movies.

There's a bunch of superheroes,
each with a different task.

Like the new Avengers.

- Which one was that?
- The one you slept through last weekend.

That was a good nap.

Well, I think it's more like
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> ,

and you're the Fellowship.

Someone's got to go to Gondor,
someone's got to go to Mordor,

someone's got to hold off
the demon of shadow and flame.

- You mean the Balrog?
-l mean, my mother.

- That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.
- Thank you.

Because it also involves a ring
that binds me in servitude forever.

He said "forever".

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

That was Wil Wheaton.
He's really excited about tomorrow.

As am I.

If you'd have told me as a child,

that an actor from Star Trek
would be officiating my wedding,

I would've said, "Ooh! William Shatner?"

And if you'd have said,
"No, Wil Wheaton," I'd have said,

"Well, did you even
try William Shatner?"

And if you'd have said,
"Yes, but he costs too much money,"

I'd have said,
"Well, Wil Wheaton's good, too. "

Why do you keep
tying and untying that bow tie?

I can't seem to get it even.

I don't think it's supposed to be even.
Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good.

In the Renaissance,
they called it "sprezzatura."

The Renaissance?

Amy, you know I'm more of
an Enlightenment person.

At some point, we have to decide
how we want to raise the children.

So, are you feeling okay?
No wedding jitters?

No.

There is nothing in the world

that would stop me
from marrying you tomorrow,

even me from the future
coming back to prevent the wedding

and the subsequent birth of a child
who will destroy humanity.

Because if you came from the future,

that would mean you already went through
with the wedding

because you believe that
time travel is on a closed loop.

I love you so damn much.

(PENNY SIGHS)

Mr. Fowler, are you okay back there?
Do you need more air?

He's fine.

I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.

Oh. Well, you know, she's pretty busy
the day before her wedding.

Too busy for her mother?
She used to be such a devoted daughter.

Now, she's just waiting for me to die,
so, she can get my china.

Thank you, again, for picking us up.

My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

You know, our driver to the airport
was also a Indian fella.

Mom.

Oh, so, now, it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian?

I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.

See? You have to excuse her.
She's just pregnant and hormonal.

Yeah, congratulations
on baby number two.

Yeah.

(SARCASTICALLY) Whoopee!

Her husband would be here,

but he stayed home
to watch their older son,

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) so, everything's fine.

(STERNLY) Stop it. We're separated.

You don't say.

AMY: So, you're Sheldon's big brother.

Oh, yeah. He got the brains.
I got the bod.

And the face and the hair.

I like your accent.

Sheldon, did you used to
sound like that? Can you still?

I can. I will not.

Amy, you said something about my bow tie
that I can't stop thinking about.

Don't you mean,

(IMITATING SOUTHERN ACCENT)
"Y'all said somethin' 'bout my bow tie?"

Go on, say it. Say it.

Hey, guys, look who I have.

- ALL: Hey!
- MISSY: Oh, my God.

- Hey, Shelly.
-l'm so glad you made it, Missy.

This is my fiancee, Amy.
Amy, this is my sister.

Hi.

If I ever need a kidney,
this is where you get it.

It's so nice to meet you.
I've always wanted a sister.

Really? Why?

I love you, too, Sheldon.

Really? Why?

Where's Mom?

She wanted to stop by the hotel
and freshen up,

and then call her pastor
to pray for Missy's soul.

Oh, my God.

- There's mama's girl.
- AMY: Hi, Mom.

Oh, Larry, look at her.

Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

He can't believe it.

And neither can I.

(LAUGHS)

Hi, Dad. How you doing?

What the hell is that?

Come on, you know this one. It's a dog.

I found him in the backyard.

And don't worry,
I already called the owner.

Good, 'cause we don't need a dog.

We already have two babies,
you and Stuart.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

That's probably him.

Hi.

(SOFTLY) I'm gonna need a minute.

(SQUEALING) That's Mark Hamill!

Hello.

Thank you so much for finding this guy.
Oh, my goodness.

Hey, Bark. How are you, buddy?

(STAMMERING) Your dog's name is Bark?

Yeah.

Bark Hamill?

Yeah. Well, I let the fans
name him online.

I got lucky, though.
He was almost Honey Baked Hamill.

Anyway, thanks so much.

I want to give you a reward
for finding him.

Oh, no, I couldn't take your money.
It's just an honor to meet you.

No. No, please. You don't know
what this dog means to me,

and I thought
he was gone for good. Please?

There must be something
I can do for you. Anything.

Oh, you're gonna regret that.

- Hey, dude.
-"Dude"?

Yeah, you know, just want you to know
that I don't think of you as a woman.

Oh, perfect.
I don't think of you as a man.

Great.

So, as two genderless blobs
of human flesh,

how would you like to go to
Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me?

Oh. Stuart.

Look, I appreciate that,
but it just might be a little weird,

considering you're my boss.

Guess who's gonna officiate
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.

Mark Hamill!

(YELLS) Luke Skywalker
is gonna be at the wedding!

You'll need to buy me a dress.

And did you know that my Amy played
Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?

Amy, you never said
you were in a school play.

Oh, no, at home.
I'd never let her do a school play.

Those kids just take drugs
and have intercourse.

You know,
Amy still does some performing.

She and Sheldon
do an Internet show about flags.

Amy'?

(STAMMERING) Videos on the Internet?

(STERNLY) You know
what men use those for.

If you're talking about Fun with Flags,
I use it to go to sleep.

Sheldon, you're awfully quiet.
Are you okay?

Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

I was thinking about string theory.
Catch me up. What'd I miss?

Are you seeing this, Larry?

These are the people I'm gonna have to
live with after you're dead.

Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice.

Yeah. Like a geode, I clean up good.

Don't you crack a geode open?

It's not a perfect metaphor.

Oh, my God. ls that Mark Hamill?

Yeah.

- Oh, my God. ls that-
-(SHOUTS) Bert, go find your seat!

What is he doing here?

I found his dog and guilted him
into officiating the wedding.

Don't tell Sheldon. It's a surprise.

Wait, I thought
Wil was officiating the wedding.

Yeah, so did he.

- How did he take the news?
-I'll let you know.

Hey. Wil!

(SNIFFLES)

Are you having an allergic reaction
to my boutonniere?

No. I'm just so happy for you.

And for me.

After today, you are officially,

and more important,
legally, Amy's problem.

Don't be silly, Leonard.
I will always be your problem.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Hey, baby.

Hello, Mother.

Leonard, could you give us a moment?

Of course.

Oh, Shelly...

I wish your dad could see you now.

Me, too. I miss him.

He would be so proud of you.
I know that I am.

Thank you.

I mean, for everything. My whole life.

(CRYING)

(LAUGHING SOFTLY)

Let me straighten your tie.

No, it's all right.

It's supposed to be
a little asymmetrical.

Apparently, a small flaw
somehow improves it.

I can see that.

Sometimes, it's the imperfect stuff

that makes things perfect.

Excuse me.

Case in point.

So, we finally meet.

I'm sorry, who are you?

I'm Wil Wheaton.

I was supposed to
officiate this wedding.

I was up all night,
preparing these notes.

Well, thanks so much.
It's gonna be a great help.

-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- SHELDON: Amy. Amy.

- Amy.
- Come in.

(PANTING) There's
something I need to tell you.

Wow, you look amazing!

That's not what I need to tell you.
But you do.

- What's wrong?
- Something incredible just happened.

Remember when you were telling me
about my bow tie,

-and how a little asymmetry is good?
- Yeah?

My equations have been trying
to describe an imperfect world,

and the only way to do that

is to introduce imperfection
into the underlying theory.

So, instead of supersymmetry,
it would be super asymmetry?

(GASPS) Super asymmetry. That's it!

- Give me your lipstick.
- What?

(SHOUTING) Just give it to me,
you beautiful thing! We have work to do!

Hey, the bride and groom
seem to be running a little behind.

Do you think you could stall?

Stall? How?

Hey, everybody!

It's gonna be a few more minutes,
but while we wait,

does anyone have
any questions about Star Wars?

You got this.

So, if I make slightly asymmetric knots
with sheets in four dimensions,

I can bootstrap the whole idea to
a large asymmetry in 11 dimensions.

Well, maybe even at
the initial moment of creation,

the fundamental forces lacked symmetry.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Everyone's waiting.
What are you guys doing?

Super asymmetry.

Super asymmetry? ls that a thing?

We're inventing it right now.

Don't you think this can wait until...

Hold on. This is interesting.

So, yeah, Mr. Mark?

When you were on
the Wookiee home planet,

how did you even understand
what they were saying?

I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.

Actually, Luke was on
the Wookiee home planet, Kashyyyk,

in the Holiday Special, when
he helped Chewie get home to his wife.

Chewie had a wife?

Her name's Malla.

Wow, that's impressive.

Yeah.

Hey, I got a question.

Why aren't there tires
on any of those Star Wars vehicles?

I'm sure some of them had tires.

Actually, they don't.

I mean, the HAVw A5 Turbo Tank
has metal-gripping wheels,

but I wouldn't call them tires.

You are so hot.

This is taking too long.
I bet that Sheldon stood my baby up.

Excuse me. Where are you going?

This whole thing was a big mistake.

I'm gonna find Amy
and get her out of here.

<i>(STERNLY) Sâ down'.!</i>

Excuse me?

Sheldon loves Amy,

and he would never hurt her
on her wedding day, or any other day,

so, park it.

Oh, you sit down, too.

Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that? Say something.

Thank you.

According to Google, there are zero
papers that mention super asymmetry.

This is brand-new.
No one's thought of it.

What are you lunatics doing?

Sheldon had a breakthrough.

Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.

Science? Shocking.

You don't understand.
This could be really big.

No, Penny's right.

We have our whole lives
to do science together.

Let's get married.

All right. It's go time. I am pumped!

Okay, everyone. Here we go.

Leonard.

That's Mark Ha... (STAMMERING)

It's Mark Hami... (STAMMERING)

Yep. Thank Wolowitz. He set it up.

Congratulations on your wedding.

Thank you.

When this is over,
I have 4,000 things for you to sign.

<i>(HERE COMES THE BRIDE PLAYING)</i>

Thank you, Daddy.

I thought Wil was marrying us.

Wolowitz got us an upgrade.

Another sci-fi guy with a beard.
Seems lateral, but okay.

Welcome.

We are gathered here today
in the sight of family, friends,

and Almighty God.

That's too religious.

That lady over there made me say it.

He heard you, and He can't un-hear you.

We're here to celebrate the marriage

of Sheldon Lee Cooper
and Amy Farrah Fowler.

I had more prepared,

but I'm just gonna skip
to the rings and vows,

since I've been answering your questions
for 45 minutes.

Yeah, he answered 'em.

Amy, you're up.

Sheldon, when I was a little girl,

I used to dream about my wedding,
but eventually, I stopped,

because I thought
that day would never come.

And then I met you.

From the first moment
in that coffee shop,

I knew that there was
something special between us,

even though I did work on a study
that disproved love at first sight.

I loved that study the moment I read it.

Ironic, huh?

Clearly, it was wrong.

Because I felt something that day,

and those feelings
have only gotten stronger with time.

I can't imagine loving you
more than I do right now.

But I felt that way yesterday,
and the day before yesterday,

and the day before that.

Is that growth linear, or accelerating?

Accelerating.

Oh, maybe we could graph it out.

Save something for the honeymoon.

Smart.

Sheldon,

I don't know what the future holds,

but I know that I've never been happier
than I am in this moment, marrying you.

Well, that was
unexpectedly beautiful. (CRYING)

(SHAKILY) I might need a minute.

Amy.

I usually know exactly what to say.

But, in this moment,

I have no words.

I guess, (EXHALES)

I'm overwhelmed by you.

In a good way.

Not in the elevator
in the Haunted Mansion way.

Even if I can't tell you now,
how I feel,

I will spend my life
showing you how much I love you.

(VOICE SHAKING) Do you...

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

(VOICE SHAKING) Do you...

Hey, I'm just sayin', I'm here,
if you need me to step in.

No, no, no. I got this.

Amy, do you take Sheldon
for your lawful wedded husband?

I do.

(VOICE CHOKING)
And, Sheldon, same thing.

I do.

Then by the power vested in me,

by even-you-can-perform-weddings-dot-com

I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

(AT LAST PLAYING)

(BARRY SINGING)
<i>At</i> wast

<i>My wove has come awong</i>

<i>My wonewy days are over</i>

<i>And wife is wike a song</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

English - SDH

Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

He can't believe it.

And neither can I.

Hi, Dad. How you doing?

Then by
the power vested in me...

by
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

Good morning, wife.

Good morning, husband.

I can't believe
we're actually married.

It's official.
According to tradition,

we should hang
the bedsheets outside

so the villagers can see
that we consummated.

I don't think that
that's appropriate,

considering where we're
starting our honeymoon.

Well, I suppose you're right.

Although,
when you think about it,

Lego is the perfect metaphor
for marital congress.

Two pieces that interlock
with a satisfying snap.

Oh, that's the sound
you were making.

Oh, I almost forgot.

While you were sleeping,
I ordered room service.

Really?

Voila.

You thought it was going
to be food, didn't you?

Is it nice having Sheldon and
Amy away on their honeymoon?

Yeah, because now Leonard and
I get all this alone time.

But you're not alone.
We're here.

Yes.
Yes, you are.

Would you like us to leave so
you and Leonard can talk about

all the things
you have in common?

Ha, ha, she called your bluff.

So, something
pretty cool happened.

Channel 3 asked me to be
on the news tomorrow night

to talk about the meteor shower.

Oh, that's great. Hey!
Congratulations.

You know, that's how Neil
deGrasse Tyson got his start.

He went from the
Hayden Planetarium

to guesting on the local news

to ruining everyone's
favourite movies on the Internet.

Now it's happening to me.

Ooh, I should probably
make a list

of all the scientific
inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.

You're gonna go on live TV and
admit you've seen that movie?

Hey, your husband's
the one who took me.

Meryl Streep and Cher?
Yeah, I saw it.

Sounds like someone's in there.

My God, what if Sheldon
and Amy are getting robbed?

Or worse, what if
they're back early?

They're not; they
just posted a picture

in front of the
Statue of Liberty.

-Real or Lego?
-Lego.

So, what should we do?
Should someone go check it out?

I would, but I got to
be on TV tomorrow.

Got to protect the money.

Oh, yeah, someone's
definitely in there.

Okay, let's go into
our apartment.

We'll lock the door,
we'll call the pol...

Hello? Anyone in there?

-Yes?
-Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler.

Sorry, we didn't
know you were here.

We... we actually thought someone
was breaking in.

And we were ready
to take them down.

Amy asked me
to water her plants.

She doesn't have any plants.

Oh.

Well, you caught me in a lie.

Have a good day.

That was weird, right?

Was it?
I... I honestly can't tell anymore.

Hey, did you even see
Mamma Mia 1?

Didn't need to.
The sequel stands on its own.

Here you go.

If you need any recommendations
while visiting New York,

please don't hesitate
to contact me.

Well, it is our honeymoon.

So we are going
to be quite busy.

Got it.

Harry Potterplay,
parts one and two.

And tomorrow,
a tour of the sites

where Nikola Tesla lived,
worked and slowly went crazy.

And, of course, coitus.

Ah.

Well, enjoy New York.
And, I guess, coitus.

Really, Sheldon?

You want to do it again?

Don't act surprised.

It's clearly marked
on the schedule.

Now, shall we steam the wrinkles
out of our wizard robes,

or make vigorous,
socially sanctioned love?

Either way, I can check
something off my to-do list.

Socially sanc... oh, wow.
Yeah, there it is right there.

Uh, hurry.
Raj is on next.

All right. I can't believe
they cancelled Vampire Diaries

but they'll show this.

This is the news.

And that was a woman torn
between two hunky vampires.

What is your point?

Larry? I know you're in there!

Is that Amy's mom?

Let me in.

Let me in!

Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.

Larry?

Mrs. Fowler,
are you okay?

Oh, I'm okay. It's my husband
you should worry about.

Oh, we do.

Larry, come on.

I don't think he's in there.

I mean, he came by to water
the imaginary plants,

but then he left.

You are so naive.

Blondie here is gonna
chew you up and spit you out.

Well, don't tell him.

Come on, you have an extra key.
Open it up.

All right, but I'm telling you
he's not in there.

There. See?

Oh, he's in here.

I can smell his Axe body spray.

He wears Axe body spray.

You happy? You smell
like Amy's dad.

-Larry?
-Ooh, come on.

Ah, shouldn't we mind
our own business?

Wow, sometimes it's like
you don't know me at all.

See, he's not here.

You don't know him like I do.

To be fair, we don't
know either of you.

Satisfied?

Oh, yeah, now I smell him.

Man, that is one
hot weather girl.

How come if I say that
I get in trouble?

You want to say it?
You can say it.

Nice try.

You're gonna have to find
some other way

to not have sex with me tonight.

And it's not weather girl,
it's weather woman.

And with us today to talk about

the upcoming meteor shower and
the best places to view it,

Caltech astrophysicist
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

-Thank you for being here.
-Thank you for having me.

I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson
was unavailable.

Yeah.

What do you mean, 'yeah'?

Not important.

So, what can we expect
to see from

this meteor shower?

Well, I think you can count
on a lot of flaming gas,

which is what
you would have gotten

from your first choice,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Pull up, Raj, pull up!

Sounds like there's no love lost
between you and Dr. Tyson.

Oh, no, I love Neil.

I mean, not as much as Neil
loves Neil, but who does, right?

I want to look away,
but I can't.

Oh, you know, I'm told we
are out of time,

having learned nothing
about meteor showers

and too much about
Dr. Koothrappali.

Thank you.

Do you know what I love
about Broadway theatre?

It's so interactive.

Uh-huh.

You're so close to the actors.
It's like you're in the play.

Uh-huh.

I mean, you yell,
'Harry, watch out,'

he looks right at you.

And not just Harry,
everyone on-stage.

At the risk of sounding
redundant, uh-huh.

All right, well,
it's a bit late,

but I did block out
the rest of the evening

for conjugal relations.

Should we shower?

I mean before, not during.

That's how you fall
and break a hip.

You know,
I'm a little jet-laggy.

Maybe we can revisit this
in the morning.

Oh, no can do.
If we miss tonight,

it's not scheduled
until Thursday at 6:00.

And that'll have
to be 'no frills,'

'cause we've got a 6:30
reservation at Benihana.

Sheldon, do we really
have to do this on a schedule?

Are you suggesting spontaneity?

I... I guess, yeah.

So, now that we're married,
sex can occur at any time?

Like, we can be
brushing our teeth,

and suddenly your minty-fresh
tongue is in my mouth?

No, thank you.

Really? Would it be so bad
to mix it up a little?

Mix it up?
Who are you, Betty Crocker?

Where are you going?

Uh, to take a shower.

Now that sex can happen
at any time,

I always have to be ready.

Should probably live
under a waterfall.

Well, you don't have to worry
about sex happening tonight.

Oh. Well, thanks,
but I'm still gonna rinse off.

I touched a lot of stuff
in the gift shop.

No message, no note.
Who would do that?

What kind of husband would...

If you let him talk,
maybe you'll find out.

Fine. Larry?

Well, there you go.
What more can he say?

Let's go home.

I think I'll stay.

Well, if you're going to stay,
then I'll stay.

All right, well, you know
who doesn't need to stay?

Us. Come on.

Penny, come on.

Aw.

I don't think those two
are gonna make it.

Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel
sorry for the little guy.

I know. After they had Amy,

she should've just eaten him
and been done with it.

Look at you retaining facts
from a nature show.

I know, really,
what did he ever see in her?

He's so, so sweet, and
she's such a ball-buster.

Some guys think
strong women are sexy.

Yeah, but they seem to have
nothing in common.

Yeah, well, sometimes
opposites attract.

Wait, are... are you saying
we are like them?

I don't know, maybe a little.

So you're the sweet, quiet one
and I'm Amy's mom?

Is that what you're saying?

Hey, check out what Neil
deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.

'I've been informed
that some random,'

attention-seeking nobody

'took a cheap shot at me
on the local news.'

That's me.
Guys, he's talking about me!

You know, I cut you
a lot of slack

'cause you come
from another country,

but you've been here
a long time.

Raj, you need to apologize
to Dr. Tyson.

Why? This could be good for me.

Everybody loves
a good Twitter feud.

Neil and I could be like

the new, uh, Katy Perry
and Taylor Swift.

Come on, Raj,
you're better than this.

Oh, leave room for dessert

'cause I'm gonna
make you eat those words.

'Dear Dr. Tyson,

'much like epithelial tissue,

it appears I've gotten
under your skin.'

iPhone drop,

but I won't
'cause I don't have AppleCare.

What'd he say?

'Nice try, genius.
The skin is epithelial tissue.'

Oh, it's on.

He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.

What are you gonna do?
He's from another country.

And here we have
the former hotel where Tesla

perfected the three-phase
alternating current motor.

That's wrong.
I'm gonna say something.

Don't.

Well, then how will everyone
know I'm the smartest boy here?

Just let it go.

Is everything all right?

You seem testy this morning.

I'm not testy.

I'll have to take
your word for it.

There's no test for testy.

Is it possible that
you're sexually frustrated?

Okay, now I'm testy.

If you had adhered
to my coital schedule,

your brain would be floating
on a sea of oxytocin right now.

Don't talk to me about my brain.
I'm a neurobiologist.

Then you should know
the benefits of the special hug

that grown-ups give each other.

Sheldon, everybody's listening.

Of course they're listening;
we're interesting.

Unlike that guy.

I... I'm walking away from you.

I'm only recently married.

Do I stay here? Do I follow?
Say something useful.

Morning, sunshine.

So I see you're making espresso.

Yup.

Just need that extra jolt

for a successful day
of ball-busting.

Really? I don't,
I don't think you do.

You know, you compared us to
the strangest couple we know,

and we know Amy and Sheldon,

Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his twitchy little dog.

I... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

Because it wasn't nice
or because it wasn't true?

It's not true.

Mrs. Fowler is an angry,
vindictive woman,

whereas you are warm
and... and loving,

quick to forgive.

Oh, please.

I... I'm serious.
And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.

He's a mousy little man
who can't stand up for himself.

My point is you're not like her,
so we're not like them.

Well, 30 years from now,
are you gonna hide from me

because I'm so scary?

Hey, I... I don't think
you're scary.

Yes, I flinch when
you make sudden moves, but...

that says more about
my childhood than you.

Aw.

Your turn.

Hang on, I'm checking
to see if Neil replied

to my latest smack-down.

Really? Don't you think this
Twitter feud is a little silly?

Absolutely not. It's... it's
two respected scientists

debating opposing views
in a public forum.

You called him
Mike Tyson's little sister.

Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's
mad at me, too.

Raj, you're not going to impress
anyone by attacking him.

Oh, Bernadette,
you sound so old right now.

He said he needs a break,

and I'm too much for him.

Oh. I'm sure he
didn't mean that.

He said I'm overbearing!

Oh, please, you're just
the right amount of bearing.

Look, I know he loves you.

If you just give him some space,
I'm sure he'll come back.

You really think so?

Yeah, I do.

You're a good person, Penny.

I hope we get to spend
lots of time together.

Me, too.

-Yes?
-Hit the road.

-But...
-Now!

-Can I get my stuff?
-Be quick about it!

-Hello.
-Hello.

I brought you two hot dogs.

A... aren't you gonna eat one?

From a street cart?
Are you crazy?

I'm amazed that
I'm holding them.

I'm not really hungry.

You realize that I'm not
a particularly physical person.

-I know.
-When I was little,

and people asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,

I'd always say,
'A brain in a jar.'

Sure.

Yeah, but I want to be
a good husband to you,

and intimacy is a part of that.

Please put those down.

I'm just worried
that if I don't schedule

our bedroom endeavours,
then I may not think about them,

and you'll grow cold and distant

and seek solace in the arms

of a heavily-muscled
longshoreman.

Where would I find
a longshoreman?

Along the shore.
It's in the name.

Sheldon, I could never be
with anybody but you.

That's good to know.

I wouldn't want to fight a man

who's brave enough
to touch a fish.

How's this for a compromise?

Make all the schedules you want,

just don't tell me about them.

Excellent.

I'll create an algorithm
that'll generate

a pseudo-random schedule.

Yeah, and do you know

why it won't be a
true random schedule?

Because the generation
of true random numbers

remains an unsolved problem
in computer science.

Come with me.

-Where are we going?
-To the hotel room.

And when we get there,
I'm gonna need you

to say that again, except naked.

Go for Dr. K.

Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?

Yes. Who is this?

Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Uh, w... wow.

How fun is this
Twitter thing, huh?

You think you're funny?

I'm... I'm not Seinfeld funny, but
I did an open mic night once.

You're not funny.

Yeah, that's what they said
at the Chuckle Hut.

How about this:

I've got a book signing at
Vroman's in Pasadena next week.

Why don't you come by and say
some of those things to my face.

Oh, no,
but thanks for the invite.

Smart move, and the next time
you pick up your phone,

remember, I'm the guy who kicked
Pluto out of the solar system.

And it deserved it, sir.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

Well, that was fun.

Let's see who else needs
a deGrasse kickin'.

Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson.
We've got to talk.

But I think, by the
end of the honeymoon,

we really started to feel
like a married couple.

But the good kind, like on TV,

-not like my parents.
-Yeah.

You're not a real married
couple until you can pee

with the door open and
she's okay with it.

I told you, I'm
not okay with it.

She loves it.

So, we got everybody gifts.

Aw.

Did you forget about us until
you were at the airport?

No.

We forgot about you until
we were on the plane.

Luckily, there was Wi-Fi,
and I have Amazon Prime.

I heart New York.

Aw, the baby's gonna
love throwing up on this.

Look, it doesn't have
to just be New York.

That's the beauty of it.

Uh, the initials 'N.Y.' can
stand for anything you like.

For instance,
I understand that there is

an elderly rock-and-roll
musician named Neil Young.

Perhaps you heart him.

Or if not him, Egyptian
table tennis silver medallist

Noha Yossry.

Or Nana Yamaguchi, the
Japanese voice actress

who starred in Sally the Witch.

Did you just google
the initials 'N.Y.'?

I had Wi-Fi and a
long plane flight.

Draw your own conclusions.

Well, guys, that was very,
very thoughtful of you. I...

Did you get me a double XL?

-I told you.
-You were right, dear.

Sheldon, that's not how
you write a thank you card.

What's wrong with it?

'Dear Aunt Helen,

'thank you so much for
the lovely place setting.

'If my handwriting
looks strained,

'that is because this is
the 16th thank you card

'Amy has forced me to write.

'The muscles in my
wrist are cramping

'as I struggle to
finish this sentence.

'Ow, ow, oh, the pain.

Love, Sheldon.'

Fine.

'And Amy.'

Ow.

This one is from
Leonard and Penny.

Aw.

'The perfect gift for
the perfect couple.'

Save that card. We may need to
throw it back in their faces.

I wonder what it could be.

Oh, could be anything.

A flute, a letter opener,

one of those pens

where you put the bikini
back on the naked lady.

Oh.

Isn't this nice?

What is it?

You know, it's, uh,
it's one of those...

Nope, doesn't do that.

Oh, maybe it's candy. Lick it.

I don't want to lick it.
You lick it.

I'm not gonna lick it.
I just brushed my teeth.

Is it from one of your
dumb sci-fi shows?

Uh, none of the sci-fi
shows I watch are dumb.

-Sheldon...
-Okay, Westworld.

But this has nothing
to do with that show,

other than it's
also inexplicable.

Well, Leonard and Penny
are our best friends.

They know us better than anyone.

They said it's the perfect gift.

We must be missing something.

You don't...

think it's a
marital aid, do you?

Don't be silly.

Amy, how is this big glass shaft

going to aid our marriage?

Do you think when Krypto
the Superdog is out flying,

Superman has to fly after
him with a little baggie?

Hmm. Haven't really
thought about it before.

But he doesn't need a baggie,

because he just blasts the
poop with his heat vision.

You've thought about it before.

Oh, I've thought about it a lot.

What is wrong with
Stuart's face?

I think he's smiling.

Oh, my God, are they flirting?

Oh, they're way past flirting.

I caught them making out
at Sheldon's wedding.

Are you sure she wasn't trying
to breathe life back into him?

I don't think so.

When I used that much
tongue at CPR training,

I had to buy the dummy.

Ooh, I have class. I should go.

Oh. Okay.

-Bye.
-Bye.

See ya, guys.

-Bye.
-Bye.

So, what's her deal?

Is she into you or does
she just hate her parents?

I... I don't know.

We kissed a little at the
wedding, and it was great.

But we haven't really
talked about it since then.

So I... I don't know how
she feels about me.

Well, she patted
you on the head,

so I'm guessing she feels
like you're such a good boy!

Seriously, do you think
I should ask her out?

A... absolutely.

Don't let love get away.

It is the most important
thing in the world.

Without it, life is

dark and meaningless
and all you're left with

is the judgemental
gaze of your dog

as you finish off a bag
of Doritos on the toilet.

Thanks.

You're a real good pal.

And now you're a good boy!

I can't stop thinking
about that present.

It's driving me crazy.

Me, too!

The card said it was
the perfect gift.

But it's not a dinosaur fossil
or matching pocket watches,

so I don't see how it can be.

Maybe we're trying too hard.

Maybe it's something simple.

Like Leonard and Penny.
Yes, good.

We just need to think like them.

Okay.

What gift can I get us

to express how grateful we
are to have us in their lives?

Way to make it simple.

I'm just gonna ask them.

No, you can't; it'll
hurt their feelings.

I'm okay with that.

And they'll know you
weren't smart enough

to figure it out on your own.

You're right. Oh, this is awful.

And I can't even comfort
myself by stroking

the fossilized tibia
of a Pentaceratops.

Let's just go to sleep.

We'll look at it in the
morning with fresh eyes,

and maybe it'll come to us.

Fine.

Or we go tear apart that
box and look for a clue.

Staying up past my bedtime
and solving mysteries?

Who knew married life
could be this good?

What's wrong with his face?

A lot of people have
been asking that.

He's... smiling.

Hey, Stuart, you
look pretty happy.

Oh, yeah.

I, uh, asked Denise
out on a date,

and she said yes.

Aw. That's great.

But don't smile like
that in front of Halley.

She just started sleeping
through the night.

Sorry. I'm excited.

I haven't been on a
date in a long time.

Back when I was
dating, I'd always wear

a new pair of
underwear, just in case.

It's also been a long time
since I bought new underwear.

And I probably should,

because these are no
longer tighty nor whitey.

Okay, I'm out.

If there's a chance someone's
gonna see you naked,

it's also polite to make sure
you're well-groomed down there.

I get it, Howard.
I've been busy!

Hello.

Hey. I just wanted

to pop over and hand-deliver
this thank you note

for your very
thoughtful wedding gift.

Oh.

Oh, good. You guys liked it?

Well, we liked it a lot more
than things that aren't it,

I'll tell you that.

Well, yeah, that's great.

Because when we saw it, we
thought, 'Amy and Sheldon'

just have to have that.'

Oh, do tell. Now,
paint a picture for me,

like where you were
when you found it

and what you thought
we'd enjoy doing with it.

Do you not know what it is?

Of course he knows

what it is. He's the
smartest man in the world.

Well, I don't know
about the world.

Some of those Chinese
fellas are pretty clever.

Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'm going

to return home and use your gift

in the manner which
it was intended.

He... he's never gonna
figure it out.

I know.

What are you?

-Gosh, this makes me happy.
-Yeah.

Howard, I don't often say this,

but, good, you're here. Now,

do you know

what Leonard and Penny got
us for our wedding gift?

Well...

Don't answer.
I don't want to know.

I just want to know if you know.

-I do know.
-Okay, great.

I believe that Amy and
I have figured it out.

Is it a clue to a scavenger hunt

that will lead us to
the actual present?

If you're asking

if you and Amy should
spend the next couple days

running all over town
searching for the next clue,

I'm gonna have to say yes.

I knew it! This is so much fun.

Oh, it really is.

Oh, Leonard, thank you again.

-We love the gift.
-Aw.

-Does he know what it is?
-No, not even close.

He thinks it's a clue
to a scavenger hunt.

So, so happy.

Well, what is it? What
did you give them?

Oh, I-it's just this
dumb crystal wand

that Howard and Bernadette
gave us for our wedding.

Penny and I made
each other miserable

trying to figure out what
it was, and we thought,

'Why not pass that fun
along to Sheldon and Amy.'

Wait a minute. Did...

did you give them the
crystal chakra wand

that I gave you
for your wedding?

Yeah, that's
exactly what we did.

You said you liked it!

Yeah, that's
exactly what I said.

Wow. A scavenger hunt.

That's exciting.

I had a bit of a scavenger
hunt myself last night.

I was trying to find the remote.

I looked under one
of the cushions.

Wasn't there.

Then I lifted the
cushion a little higher.

Bingo.

Riveting.

So, do you know what it is?

Of course I know what it is.

It's a silicon dioxide crystal,

otherwise known as quartz.

Are you sure?

Am I sure?

Is basalt a mafic extrusive
igneous rock formed

by the rapid cooling of
magnesium and iron-rich lava?

Yeah, I'm sure.

Okay, so it's quartz.

That's got to mean something.

What do we know about quartz?

I'll google it.

Or you can ask me, the geologist

who won the MacArthur
Genius Grant.

Got it!

Quartz, from the German 'quarz'

which sounds the same, but
is spelled without a 'T'.

Interesting. No 'T'.

What is not 'T'?

Coffee!

The coffee shop
where we first met!

All right, let's go.

Sorry.

I think I just had an adrenaline
rush from having visitors.

Hey, Raj, will you, um,
smell something for me?

Uh, that depends.

Actually, it doesn't depend.
Just no.

I'm trying out some new colognes
for my date with Denise.

Oh, and you just came over here

to rub it in my face
that you have a date?

No. I came over here
because I need advice,

and you've gone out with more
women than anybody I know.

Huh. I guess you're right.

Sheldon's the smart one,
Howard's the funny one,

and apparently, I'm
the ladies' man.

Which one's Leonard?

Oh, yeah, right.

I guess Leonard's
the forgettable one.

Okay, let's have a whiff.

Hmm. Smells like Paco Rabanne.

Ooh, you're good.
I bought it at a swap meet.

It's actually called
'Smells Like Paco Rabanne.'

It's great. She's gonna love it.

I hope so.

I really like Denise, and I
don't want to screw this up.

Hey, relax.

Trust your instincts.
That's what I do.

And that works for you?

Actually...

no.

I've made a mess of
my life, and I'm...

I'm all alone.

Okay, I think it'd be
best for both of us

if I pretend to get a phone
call and just walk away.

Yeah, that would be best.

Hello. This is Stuart.

Sorry. I got to take this.

Uh, why, yes, I'd
love to take a survey.

Okay, this is
where we first met.

There's got to be a
clue here somewhere.

We sat at that table.

Excuse me.

I'm sorry. We're on
a scavenger hunt.

Just pretend we're not here.

Oh, I found something!

It's gum.

Maybe they left it
behind the counter.

I met my wife here, and
we sat at this very table,

so if you play your cards
right, in eight years,

you could marry this woman.

That's my sister.

Well, don't tell people.
That's not okay.

Sheldon, look,
I asked the barista

if anyone left anything for us,

and she said to look in
this lost and found box.

But why would it be in
the lost and found box?

Because we were lost, and
then we found each other.

It makes perfect sense.

Oh. And look at this.

A locket.

And that stone in front...
I bet it's quartz.

This must be it. This
must be the actual gift.

Open it up. What's inside?

Nothing. It's empty.

Of course.

Our life together
is just starting,

and they want us to fill
it with our memories.

This might be the best
wedding gift ever.

They also left us a
pair of sunglasses

because our future's so bright!

They thought of everything!

Oh.

Look what Halley drew.

Yeah, she made it at daycare.

It's pretty good, huh?

Is it?

Wow. Gentile moms are tough.

Guys, I need to
show you something,

but you have to promise
not to make fun of me.

Of course.

Whoa.

Yeah. I was worried
about the date

so I got my hair coloured

to make me feel a
little more confident,

but that just made
me look paler,

so I... I got a spray tan.

Have you tried showering,

seeing if you
could scrub it off?

I did.

You're gonna need
some new towels.

And a bathmat.

And a toilet seat.

I'm picking her up in an hour.

What am I gonna do?

Don't you mean
what are you gonna

'Oompa Loompa doompety do'?

You said you weren't
gonna make any jokes.

I'm sorry. I'll stop.

Look, it's only a spray tan.
It'll fade in a couple days.

Why don't you cancel
the date and reschedule?

Oh, but I was really
looking forward to tonight.

You know what? Then go.
Tell her what happened.

Maybe she'll be flattered.

And if not,

swing by the chocolate factory
and see if they're hiring.

That wasn't a joke. That
was a legitimate suggestion.

Hello?

Hey, Dad.

Rajesh. What a nice surprise,
calling me on my birthday.

Yes. That's why I'm calling.

And... and what better gift
to give you than the gift

of marrying an Indian woman,

just like you've always wanted.

My goodness, Rajesh,
this is exciting news.

Who is she?

You tell me.

What?

I want you to arrange
a marriage for me.

I'm just so tired
of being single,

and I'm finally just...
I'm... I'm ready to settle down.

I can't just call
up some girl's dad

and make her marry you.

It's... it's not 2015 anymore.

I know that, but I
can't do this on my own.

I need your help.

Well, then, I'm going
to need your help, too.

If I'm going to find a
woman to set you up with,

you're going to need to
stop Instagramming pictures

of you and your dog
wearing matching sweaters.

Fine, if that's what it takes
to show you that I'm serious.

Uh, quick question.

Do you mean just Instagram,
or all my social...?

All of them!

Okay, deal.

All right. Let me
ask you a question.

What do you think of this woman?

Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

Is that who you're
going to set me up with?

No! That's who I'm dating.

But maybe she has
an older sister.

So we put a little picture of me

and a little picture
of Sheldon in it.

In... in the locket?

Yes.

That was in a lost
and found box?

Exactly.

Where we hid it?

So really, you gave us
three amazing gifts.

You gave the locket,
the adventure

and the realization that
Amy and I can do anything

as long as we work together.

We wrote you a special
thank you note.

Oh.

Are those words?

No.

It's a secret code that you
two get to figure out together.

It's based on Sanskrit,

but not the Sanskrit
you're thinking of.

And best of all, you can't
use the Internet to cheat.

Because we locked you
out of your Wi-Fi,

and the answer to this
is your new password.

I'm no longer happy.

Hey, guys. Great news.

I'm getting married.

-Huh? What?
-No.

Well, I... I haven't met her yet,

but her name is Anu.

My father says she comes
from a good family.

She's in her 30s.

She works in
hospitality management.

So, as long as I can get
through six to ten dates

without revealing
my true self...

this is happening.

I know just what we're giving
them for a wedding gift.

Oh.

Oh, my God.

Yeah.

I wanted to look my
best for our date,

and I made a series
of bad decisions...

one of which is
hidden by my pants.

Wow.

Do you still want
to go out with me?

Absolutely.

Hey, maybe we can go
find Nemo together.

That's a good one.

Do your 63 other crayon
friends know you're out?

Are you just gonna make
fun of me all night?

Probably.

Great. So what are
we thinking, Chinese?

Yeah, I'm in the mood
for orange chicken.

So, Penny, we were talking
to our neighbours,

and they're thinking of moving
and selling their house.

Really? Why?

Something about babies crying

and keeping them up all night;
it's not important.

You guys should totally
take a look at it.

Then we could be neighbours.

Hey. Wait a minute,
what about us?

I mean, we're married now.

Maybe we want to buy
the house next door.

Well, Amy, we can't move.

I'd have to change all
the tags in my underwear.

You can buy new ones.

What... new house, new
underwear. What am I,

in the Witness
Protection Program?

Okay. Guys,
so what do you think?

Well, I don't know,
w... we're pretty happy here.

Yeah. Plus, if we moved,
we'd probably just get

a loft down town.

Really?

I always figured we'd
get a place with a yard.

Oh, sure, yeah,
that makes sense,

so you could shoot hoops
and mow the lawn?

How are you two married?

You were there.
I wore her down.

He did.

You guys should've talked
about all this stuff

while you were dating.

I mean, me and Anu already
know so much about each other.

Wait, I forget,
is Anu your waxer?

Uh, no, that's Annette.

Anu is the woman my
father fixed me up with.

We're going
on our first date tomorrow.

Which reminds me,
I need to see Annette.

You're really letting your
father pick out a wife?

Why not?

Arranged marriages have been
working for thousands of years.

Anu and I come
from similar backgrounds,

our families get along
and we each

filled out questionnaires, so we
know we're not wasting our time

with someone
who's not compatible.

Oh, that sounds so dry
and clinical.

You lucky duck.

I just don't think you
can truly know someone

until you've spent a
lot of time with them.

Really? What's Penny's
dream vacation?

Uh, Malibu beach house.

That's Barbie's
dream vacation.

Maybe you should send
us that questionnaire.

Enjoying your book?

So much.

Why do you keep poking at it?

Fine, I'm shopping on my phone.

You're the one who said
you wanted to read more.

Yes, I also tell people
I only feed the kids organic.

It's just stuff you say.

-Hey.
-Ah, hello.

Hey.

How was your night?

Ah, it was great.
We went to an improv show.

Yeah. They asked the
audience to suggest a word,

and they used Stuart's.

Oh, cool, what was it?

Coconuts.

It was such a good one.

It just came to me.

-Uh, what are you guys up to?
-Reading.

Oh, nice, I wish I read more.

Well, if it's important,
you find the time.

You want to see my room?

-Yeah.
-Cool.

How do you feel about this?

That she can clearly do better,
but that's not for me to say.

No, with them in his
room, doing stuff.

Oh, come on, we're
sitting right out here.

They're not gonna do anything.

# Smooth operator

# Smooth operator...

I'd like to change my answer.

# Smooth operator.

Wow, you really are
good at this.

Well, I've spent a lot of time
painting D & D miniatures.

I know that makes you want
to rip my shirt off,

but wait until
your nails are dry.

Oh, it's Raj.

He sent us that Indian marriage
questionnaire.

-Ooh, read one.
-Okay.

'How religious are you?'

That's easy, both of us:
not at all.

No, I wouldn't say not at all.
I mean, I am pretty spiritual.

I do go to yoga, so...

Great, so your church is
Our Lady of the Stretchy Pants.

Next question.

Uh, 'how close are you
with your family?'

Pretty close.

I'm gonna say not too close,

but I'm hoping to get farther.

How do you feel about children?

Um, they're okay, I guess.

I mean, if I saw one,
I wouldn't throw a rock at it.

W-Why would you throw
a rock at a child?

I just said I wouldn't.

The question is would
you like to have kids.

So, yeah, we want kids.

Yeah... someday.

Right, like, in the
next five years.

Sure, uh, next question.

'How are you with pets?'

Well, I did take care
of Sheldon for 15 years,

and he only bit me twice.

I have to say, uh, after
reading your questionnaire,

I feel like I already know you.

Totally. Me, too. Excuse me.

Can we please get
sparkling instead of tap,

some clean silverware
and find out

what they're having?
That looks delicious.

-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

So, you're an astrophysicist.

Yes, ma'am.

I-I mean, uh, just yes.
U-Unless you prefer 'ma'am.'

I don't.

Good, because you don't
seem like a ma'am.

You seem more
like a sweet thang.

Wow. You are not good at this.

Well, if I was good at this,

I wouldn't need to be
fixed up by my father.

I never thought I'd let
my family set me up, either,

but I'm 34,
I'd like to have kids

and it's hard to date
because I work so much.

Oh, yes, uh, you're a concierge.

For now.

I plan to be managing a
hotel in the next five years.

Four, if I can get the current
manager out of the way.

He's a smoker,
so fingers crossed.

I-I get it. You know, um,

I used to have a long list
of what I wanted from a wife.

Uh, eyes like Sandra Bullock,

hair like Sandra Bullock,

and the bravery of Ryan Stone.

That's Sandra Bullock's
character in Gravity.

But now,
I-I just want someone nice.

I think I'm nice. Are you nice?

Oh, I'm definitely nice.

Every time a girl breaks up
with me she always starts with,

'You're a nice guy.'

Look, your whole sweet,
insecure thing is cute,

but honestly,
I have no time for that.

If you're not
serious about this,

you need to walk away now.

I-I am serious.

Good.

Okay.

O-Okay, w-what does this mean?

I think it means I might be
the future Mrs...

Koothrappali.

How would you feel
if I didn't change my name?

A little hurt,

but you wouldn't know,
because I'm too nice.

Hey, want to get lunch?

I can't. Halley and
Michael were up all night,

and I'm way behind here.

Oh, no, are they sick?

No. They were just laughing and
playing like a couple of jerks.

Boy, they're cute,
but they ruin everything.

I get that.

You know,
I've been thinking lately

that maybe I don't want kids.

Are you crazy?

Of course you want them.
It's amazing.

You just said
they ruin everything.

I'm allowed to. It's their fault
I pee when I laugh.

Hang on, why is it crazy
to say I might not want kids?

Oh, it's not crazy.
It's just wrong.

You only think
you don't want kids,

but once you have kids, you'll
realize that you did want them.

Or I don't want them,

so I won't have
them, so back off.

Aw, you sound just like me
before I became a mom

and learned
what the meaning of love was.

Wow, I cannot believe how
condescending you're being.

Look, I know it's scary,
but you're gonna be a great mom.

I know I'd be great, but the
point is I don't want to be one.

Maybe you wouldn't be great.
You kind of got a temper.

You know, not everyone needs
to have kids to be fulfilled.

You're right,

you've got Leonard.

What more do you need?

-Hey, guys.
-Hello.

Hey.
How was your date?

Ah, let me answer that
with a question.

How would you like to be
my best man?

Wait, you're not seriously

marrying a woman
you've met once.

Why not? She's nice, I'm nice.

We're just as likely to be
happy as any other two people.

Maybe even happier.

Sorry, that was not
a swipe at you.

I didn't think it was.

Yeah, good, 'cause it was not.

Well, I, for one,

applaud Raj's decision to
forgo emotional attachment

and find a life
partner by bowing

to a 3,000-year-old
authoritarian tradition.

What are you talking about?

You married a woman
you're in love with.

I can't believe you're throwing
that back in my face.

Why can't you just be
happy for me?

Because you're being dumb.

You don't know anything
about her.

W-Well, how come you all
get to be married

and I have to stay single?

I think that's a question
for a licensed professional.

You know what, you're not
just insulting me.

Okay? You're insulting
my family, my culture

and my future bride, Anu,

a vegetarian with
a master's degree from Cornell

whose favourite fruit
is pineapple.

Now, I'm not sure if this
helps, but did you know

that pineapples
were once so rare

that King Charles posed
for a portrait with one?

How does that help?

Oh, it helped me.
I've been trying to slide that

into a conversation for years.

Hey, honey, how was your day?

What's wrong?

Raj is talking about

marrying this woman he just met.

I told him it was dumb,

and now he's mad at me.

The same thing happened to me.

Penny said she
didn't want kids,

and I told her
she was being silly,

and she accused me
of being condescending.

Which is crazy, because
if I wanted to be condescending,

I would've said,
'Ooh, 'condescending.'

That's such a big word.'

Why won't our friends
just listen to us?

We obviously know what
we're talking about.

I know.

We're married,
we have great kids,

great jobs, this great house.

# Smooth operator

Hey, Leonard, remember yesterday

when we were talking
about having kids someday?

Yeah?

Well, what if it wasn't someday.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, are you pregnant?

No. No. No, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

So?

-No.
-Oh.

What I meant was,

what if, what if we
didn't have kids?

Ever?

I mean, our life is so great.

Why would we want
to change that?

Sure.

Sure.

Sure. And I guess it
would be hard raising kids

in the... the loft you
never told me you wanted.

-Well, wait, don't be mad.
-I'm not mad.

Why would I be mad?

There's nothing to be mad at!

You have to-to turn the thing.

I knew that!

-Hi, Leonard.
-I'm not mad!

You're awfully quiet.

-Sorry.
-No, I like it.

Got a lot on my mind.

Would you like to talk about it?

Not really.

Grape Nuts for breakfast,
quiet car ride,

things are really
breaking my way today.

It's just Penny hit me
with some pretty big news

and it's a lot to process.

And you'd like to do that
quietly. I respect that.

She said she doesn't want
to have kids.

Maybe she didn't mean it,

like when you said you didn't
want to talk about this.

Forget it.

Do you want to have children?

Well, I always assumed we would,

and now I find out, you know,

I might be the last
of the Hofstadter line.

Doesn't your brother
have children?

And your sister.
She kept the Hofstadter name

and has five healthy boys:

Neil, Jeffrey, Scott,
William and baby Richard.

I'm going back to being quiet.

Sweet.

Hey. Mind if I sit?

Did you just come
here to tell me

I'm making a gigantic mistake

by having this blueberry muffin

and I should've got
a cinnamon roll like you did?

No.

Good, 'cause I'm happy
with my choice.

Although that cinnamon
roll does smell good

if you're open to halfsies.

Fine.

Thanks.

Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

You're right.
I-I was being...

Oh, my God, that is so good!

I can wait.

No...
Sorry.

Go on.

I've known you a long time.

You believe in romance more
than any person I've ever met

and it's hard to see you
give up on that.

But if you really think
marrying this woman

is gonna make you happy,

then you have my complete
and total support.

I will be with you
every step of the way.

Thanks, Howard.
That means a lot.

So, hey, is this wedding
gonna be in India?

Ah, maybe.

Ugh.

What the hell, Penny?

I'm gonna need more than that.

You're not having kids?

How could you do this to me?

How is it any of your business?

Because your kids were supposed
to be friends with my kids.

Who's gonna be friends
with them now?

They will find other friends.

Oh, sure, 'cause
Sheldon's DNA plus my DNA

equals a kid who knows
how to make friends. Grow up!

This is between me and Leonard.

Screw Leonard!

We were supposed to
get pregnant together.

We were gonna be barf buddies.

We were supposed to massage
each other's perineums

with vitamin E.

I'm about to be
your barf buddy right now.

Listen, when you have kids,

I'm still gonna be there.

I'm gonna be their fun Aunt
Penny who gives them candy,

and teaches them swear words

and tells them stories about
what a weirdo their mother is.

I guess I could live with that.

What is gonna be hard is

letting go of the dream of

us breastfeeding
each other's babies.

And it's gonna be hard
to forget you said that.

No.

What would you say if I told you

I was totally naked
under this robe?

I would say that sounds
pretty good.

Really?

Well, I did not see that coming.
One second.

# Smooth operator

Oh, come on.

Wait. Stay in the mood.

I'll put on our own music
and drown them out.

# You want a hot body?

What's this?

It's from my workout mix.

It's what I listen to when
I'm firming up my glutes.

Can you get him?

Sure.

-Hey, Howard.
-Yeah?

It looks like you could crack
a walnut in those glutes.

I can't. I tried.

Hey.

Hey. I... I made you dinner.

In-N-Out Burger out of
the wrapper on a plate.

Thank you, but you don't
have to do this. I'm fine.

I... I know it's not a baby,

but it does leak
when you pick it up.

Really?

We're joking about this now?

No, look, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to just
drop all of this on you.

I... it just took me by surprise.

I... I always imagined having kids.

I know you did.

But I've imagined having
a lot of things

that I'm never gonna get:

a Nobel Prize,

a working Batmobile.

But I also have a lot that

I never thought I'd have...

like you.

Are you sure
that's enough?

Yeah.

-You're really okay with this?
-I am.

Hey, Daddy.

What's this Leonard
says about you

not wanting to give
me grand-babies?

He might feel
differently. Bye.

I told my parents
our first date went well

and they got very excited.

Oh, tell me about it.

My parents were so thrilled,

they actually spoke
to each other.

So that was a disaster.

Cheers.

Okay. I guess if we're going
forward with this wedding,

we should talk about
the next steps.

Oh, like themes and flowers?

Actually, finances and taxes.

Oh. We can't use that.

That was the theme
of my parents' divorce.

I know that money can
be a source of friction

in a new marriage and I
want us to avoid that.

Of course. Yeah, right.
That's s... smart.

So, my accountant feels strongly

that we should file
separately the first year

and then we can re-evaluate
based on our joint assets.

You okay?

No, I can't do this.

Why not?

Th... there's something
you may not know about me

'cause, you know,
we've only met once, but...

I'm a hopeless romantic.

And you seem great

and I do want to get married.

I... I do want to
settle down, but...

this isn't the story that
I want to tell my grand kids.

I understand.

I'm so sorry if
I wasted your time.

Raj.

I know we don't know each
other very well, but...

you seem like you'd make
a good father and...

you're tall enough so
I can wear heels and...

I think that's something
worth fighting for.

Will you marry me?

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

Yes, of course, of course
I'll marry you!

-If you'd like to kiss me you can.
-Oh, great.

I should warn you I have
a tongue piercing.

Oh, you're not that nice.

Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

Because if it has the words
'farmers' or 'market' in it,

I don't want to go.

You were talking
about all the things

you thought you
would never have,

so I thought I
would get you one.

Oh, my God.
You bought me the Batmobile?

No. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

I rented you the
Batmobile for the day.

This is amazing.
Thank you.

B... be careful. I... I did
not get the insurance.

Come on, Robin!

Hey, whatcha doing?

Improving our wedding photos.

Oh, that's nice.

Wait, I'm still in them, right?

Of course.
And not only you.

I've added some guests
who couldn't be there.

Who's that next
to my father?

The Wright brothers.

And why are they at our wedding?

Orville, because I admire him;

Wilbur, because he was
Orville's plus-one.

Oh. You got an e-mail
from someone named Tam.

Tam? What does he want?

Uh...

looks like he's coming to give
his son a tour of Caltech.

He's hoping you
guys can meet up.

He would like that, wouldn't he?

Well, that is the gist
of the e-mail.

Who's Tam?

He was my best friend in
the whole world growing up.

Really?

Why have I never heard
you mention him before?

Oh, of course I have.
I'm sure I've mentioned him,

like, five times this week.

I don't think you have.

Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam!
There, it's only Thursday.

I didn't just drink the crazy
milk, I bought the crazy cow.

So, are you actually engaged
to this woman you just met?

Yeah.

Tell us the truth.
Did she get you pregnant?

Very funny.

Guys, I need your help, okay?

I'm trying
to buy her engagement ring.

What do you think of this?

Do you think she'll
like this one?

Well, it's hard to say,
not knowing much about her.

Does she have fingers?

Yes, she has ten fingers
and ten toes.

Probably. I'll get back to you
after I see her in sandals.

Hey, did you guys know
that Sheldon had

a best friend growing up
named Tam?

Was that the imaginary
talking koala?

No. He's a real person
who apparently betrayed him.

Yeah, so did the koala.

I tried to ask him about it,

and he invoked section
three, article five

of the marriage contract,
beeswax, comma, none of your...

I can't pry. I mean, I
have to respect his wishes.

Wow. I wonder
what that guy could've done

to make Sheldon
not talk to him for 20 years.

I wonder if it'd work
a second time.

I'm pumping!

It's Penny.

Oh. Come in.

I thought you were pumping.

I thought you were my boss.

Okay, listen, I'm really worried
about this whole Raj thing.

I know, he's so desperate to
get married, which is weird,

because I can't imagine we
make it look that great.

I know, right?

You know, if this
woman's gonna be around,

I think we should
check her out a little.

I looked online.
She doesn't have an Instagram,

which means she's either 80
or something's wrong with her.

Well, I could ask my dad.

Maybe he can get some
of his old cop buddies

to do a background check on her.

-Would he do that?
-Of course.

He's a retired cop
who plays by his own rules.

Hi, Daddy.

No, everything's good.
I just have a favour to ask.

Yeah, so, my friend Raj

is marrying this woman
that he barely knows,

and I wanted to see if you
could use your connections

to dig up any dirt on her.

Uh-huh.

Sure.

Okay.

Love you.

Is he in?

Absolutely not. He won't do it.
It's totally illegal.

I thought you said
he played by his own rules.

He does, but apparently,

they're very similar
to the actual rules.

I still can't believe
Sheldon had a best friend

we've never
heard about.

Ooh, somebody's jealous.

I'm not jealous.

Leonard, this is a safe space...

it's okay to be vulnerable.

All I'm saying is
you know the timing

of a fellow's bowel movements,

you don't think there's
a lot left to discover.

I wonder what Tam
could have done.

Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't
want to talk about it,

it's got to be
pretty upsetting.

I have his brother George's
number... he might know.

Really? You have
George's number?

So so jealous.

Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,

Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.

The two of them were
always running around together.

So, what happened?

What do you mean?

Well, I mean, Sheldon
never talks about him.

They haven't spoken in years.
He wasn't at the wedding.

He wasn't?

All right, well,
this is embarrassing,

'cause I had a long conversation

with someone
who I thought was Tam.

Wait, wait, so you don't know
what their fight was about?

I wish I could help you, boys.

But, you know,
Sheldon used to keep

an enemies list
when he was a kid.

Oh, he still does.

Really? I figured

that went the same way
as his bathroom schedule.

If you mean digitized, annotated
and put online, it did.

Maybe that'll tell you
something.

Hey, while you're looking at it,
if I'm still on there

for peeing
in his shampoo bottle...

Eh, you know what,
just leave it.

-See ya, boys.
-Bye.

Bye. All right,
got his enemies list.

Ooh, he updated the interface.

You can search by first name,
last name or length of grudge.

Is Tam on it?

Let's see.

Yep. Right here.
Tam Nguyen.

Oh, great. What did he do?

Hold on. I have to agree
to the terms of service.

No, I'm not a robot.

Okay. 'Which of
these are plants?'

And we're in.

Great. What... what
does it say?

Well...

'He knows what he did.'

Oh, come on.

Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, if Tam knows

what he did, we
can just ask him.

He's gonna be on campus
tomorrow showing his son around.

Won't that make Sheldon mad?

Everything makes Sheldon mad.

Yeah.
Look at his list.

Jim Henson for, quote,

'putting a terrifying,
giant yellow bird on television

and in my nightmares.'

-Oh, this is so nice.
-Mm-hmm.

Maybe instead of introducing
ourselves to Anu,

we could just get a room,
order some food and take a nap.

Yeah, I've fallen
for that line before.

It never leads to napping.

That must be her.

Oh. She's cute.

Okay, I got you two seats
to Hamilton tonight.

Your tickets will be
at the concierge desk.

Of course.
My pleasure.

May I help you?

Yes, I'm here to pick up
our Hamilton tickets.

Stop.

Hi. We're Raj's friends.

I'm Penny.
This is Bernadette.

We just came by to
introduce ourselves.

So you came to check me out?

She's smart.
I like her.

We just want to see
if we could take you

to dinner
and get to know you a bit.

That sounds nice.
How about tonight after work?

Maybe we can go to Bavel.

Oh, I wish. That place is
impossible to get into.

Oh, please.

Getting into impossible
places is my superpower.

Me, too.

I can fit my whole body
in our dryer.

All set. 8:30.

Wow. Okay, well,
we'll see you tonight.

-See you then.
-Okay.

Bye.

She can get into any restaurant,

but the best husband
she can find is Raj?

Not Tam.

Not Tam.

Not Tam.

Got him.

-Tam Nguyen?
-Yeah.

Yes. Is my son
done with his tour?

No idea. We're actually
friends of Sheldon Cooper.

Oh, I've been trying
to get in touch with him,

but I never heard back.
Is he okay?

Well, if you mean
physically, yes.

If you mean every other way, no.

So, is he here?

Uh, no. He... he didn't come.
He's, uh...

he's still pretty
upset about...

you know.

I know what?

Come on, you... you must know.

No, we haven't talked in,
like, 20 years.

Right. Because...

you know.

I don't think
he knows.

What are you guys talking about?

Why did you and Sheldon
stop being friends?

What did you do?

And don't worry,
even though we just met you,

we think you're right
and he's wrong.

I didn't do anything.

He moved to California,
and we just drifted apart.

Oh, come on, there's
got to be something...

What is going on here?

Oh, hey, Sheldon. We just met...

Sheldon! So good to see you!

Tam.

It's been a long time.

Mm, not long enough
to erase the sting of betrayal.

How did I betray you?

You know what you did.

Uh, let me catch you up.

He does not.

When I moved to California,
what did you do?

I stayed in Texas.

Do you believe this guy?

So, he was your best
friend growing up?

Yes.

Were there no other
kids in Texas?

Hey. What is
going on with you?

I don't want to talk about it.

Well, I'm sure you have a
perfectly stupid reason.

I don't do anything
for a stupid reason.

Except, perhaps,
Talk Like a Pirate Day,

and I'd argue that's
more whimsical than stupid.

You know, I was
curious to find out

what Tam had done wrong.

Why am I not surprised
the answer is nothing?

So you're taking his side.

You scurvy dog.

You watch yourself.

There is room on my enemies list

now that the cafeteria
ladies finally told me

what's in the chilli.

By the way, don't eat the chilli.

Wai... wai... wait, you know what?

Do.

Be careful, Sheldon.

I don't think you can afford
to lose a second best friend.

I don't see anyone lining up
to be your third.

D... wait.

'Snarky comebacks...'

Oh, here we go.

'You have your entire life
to be a jerk,

why not take today off?'

That was harsh,
but he was asking for it.

This place is amazing.

I can't believe
you got us in here.

Well, it's kind of my job.

Usually I get tipped for it,
but I'll leave that up to you.

Look, I think that's
LeBron over there.

James?

No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

So, what do you want to know?

Well, you seem like a
smart, successful woman,

why would you want to marry
someone you just met?

Fair question.

In my 20s, I tried this
the normal way.

You know, met a guy,
fell in love,

we moved in together.

I put him through culinary school,
screen-writing classes, and...

finally dumped him when he
wanted to become a midwife.

Then I realized,

my parents are happy;
they had an arranged marriage.

Why am I fighting this?

I dunno, I married for love
and it turned out...

fine.

Oh, yeah, me, too.

Hi.

Howard, today is your lucky day.

Leonard's out, you're
my new best friend.

Well, I'm not thrilled about
it either, but here we are.

Okay, fine.
Is Bernadette there?

Sh... no.

Just Stuart?

Let me call you back.

Let me guess.

This thing with Tam escalated,

and now you're mad at Leonard

and looking for
a new best friend?

You know me so well.

It's too bad you can't be
my best friend.

I can be.

You can't be my wife
and my best friend.

Who would I complain
about you to?

Just tell me what happened.

Leonard talked to
Tam behind my back

and took his side.

And after what he did to me.
Can you believe it?

No. I'm... I'm shocked
and outraged.

Now, tell me why
I'm shocked and outraged.

Fine.

When I got accepted
to grad school at Caltech,

I was afraid to move
so far away from home.

So Tam said he'd
move out here with me

and be my room mate.

Then, over the summer,
he got a girlfriend,

even after reading
all the pamphlets

I gave him
about social diseases.

Aw, I remember when you
gave me those pamphlets.

Anyway, Tam stayed
with her in Texas,

and I had to move out
here all by myself.

That must've been scary.

It was.

I was lonely,

and I thought
I'd never make a friend again.

And for a long time, I didn't.

But then you did.

And great friends.

If you think about it,

if Tam had moved
out here with you,

who knows what your life
would've been like.

Yes.

Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

I called you about the apartment.
You said...

Tell him to go away.
You already have a room mate.

New neighbour?

Oh, hi.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Tam, look.
Sheldon's hugging me.

It's a Saturnalia miracle.

Sheldon, come here.

Bazinga.

No, my life would've
still been great.

So what is the craziest
request anyone's ever made?

Oh, you know,
I can't really say.

Concierge-guest confidentiality.

Really, that's a thing?

No.

This one time, I had to go
to Walmart at 3:00 a.m.

because Britney Spears
needed to blow bubbles.

Oh.

That is so cool.

By the way, do not tell Raj
that you met Britney Spears,

because he will literally die.

We've been talking so much
about me,

tell me about Raj.

Okay, are you trying
to get us drunk

so we'll dish on
our friend?

'Cause it's totally gonna work,
what do you want to know?

What kind of guy is he?

He is great.

-So great.
-Mm-hmm.

How come he's still single?

-He's great.
-So great. Yeah.

Come on.

There's really nothing to tell.

Raj is so much fun
to hang out with.

He's like one
of our girlfriends.

And I mean that in a good way.

But also a bad way.

Anything else?

-No.
-No.

I mean,

he takes baths with his dog,
but not in a weird way.

Or a normal way;
they both wear swimsuits.

He also cries every time
Hugh Jackman sings.

But not cute sniffles...
full-on snot sobs.

But he is great.

-So great.
-Yeah.

Hello, Sheldon.

Hello Tam.
Thank you for coming.

I just want you to know
that, um...

I forgive you.

I didn't do anything.

And yet, here I am,
still being the bigger man.

Look, I was in love with Beth,

and she made me happy.

Y... really?

Did she let you play
with her train set?

In a manner of speaking.

Sheldon, I needed
to stay in Texas.

And you needed to come here.

I knew you were gonna
do amazing things,

and meet amazing people
who were gonna respect you,

because you're brilliant.

And because they never had to
fish you out of a dumpster.

Well, they have,

but it was during my
short-lived park-our phase.

I didn't mean to upset you.

And I want you to know
I'm really proud

of everything you've done.

Thank you.

It did work out for me.

And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out for you.

They did work out for me.

Oh, Tam, you don't need
to be brave on my account.

I'm not.

I have a great wife
and amazing children.

I'm very happy.

Brave, brave Tam.

Sounds like Penny and
Bernadette had fun last night.

I know. Bernie came
home pretty drunk.

She tried to sleep in the dryer.

Hello, you all remember Tam,

my best friend from high school.

-Yeah.
-Of course. How's it going?

Sheldon's been showing
me and my son around.

Now we know where all
the clean bathrooms are.

Yep.

You just remember the mnemonic:

if it's number one,
the library's fun,

if it's number two,
the basement's for you.

I'm glad you guys made up.

Well, I realized my life
turned out great,

and it's silly
to hold a grudge.

And I had no idea we were
fighting, so it was easy.

Uh, don't worry, Leonard,

you're still
my California best friend.

Cool.

So, what do you want to do now?

Go to the train store,
go to the comic book store?

Actually, I have to grab my
son and head to the airport.

I was just about to call a cab.

Don't be silly,
you don't have to call a cab.

You're my oldest friend.

Leonard will take you.
Right, Leonard?

Sure.

Shall we?

Eh, eh, eh, hold on.

I haven't seen
Tam in 20 years,

give me a chance
to say good-bye.

Bye.

Check it out...
LeBron James posted a picture

of me and him on Instagram.

I don't see you.

Look right behind him.

No.

Okay. You see that table
just past his left shoulder?

Now go back two more tables
and over to the right.

All I see is a yellow smudge.

That's me!

Oh, it's Raj.

Hey Raj,
I'm here with Penny.

What the hell did
you two say to Anu?

Uh...

whatever do you mean?

Why, why would you tell her

I wear ladies deodorant?

Uh, because you're a boy
and it's really funny.

Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me

for having the confidence
to smell daisy-fresh.

Just do me a favour
and stay away from her.

Ugh, God, now I feel bad.

I know.

Maybe we should
take her out again

and do some damage control.

You know, that's a good idea.

Think she can
get us into SoHo House?

I don't know, but we
owe it to Raj to try.

Mm-hmm.

Recently, 12 new moons

were discovered
orbiting Jupiter,

bringing the total up to 79.

As a middle child myself,
I'd like to extend

my sympathies to
moons two through 78.

Your grandpa will
never learn your name.

I'd like to thank
you for joining me

on this journey
through the stars.

If you enjoyed this lecture,

please come back Thursday

for the exact same one.

Do I look like I just woke up?

No.

Great. I'm gonna
go say hey to Raj.

What were you guys
giggling about?

They were passing
notes to each other.

Oh-ho, love notes?

If you love math.

And we do.

It's for our
super-asymmetry theory.

Yeah, Amy and I have been having

so much fun
collaborating together.

Well, you know what they
say, you never collaborate

as much as your first
year of marriage.

-Hey, great show.
-Thanks.

Oh, Howard, uh, this is Andrea.

She's the director
of the planetarium.

Hi.

Nice to meet you.
I'm Howard Wolowitz.

Engineer, husband, father...

astronaut.

Really? You're an astronaut?

Well, I don't like to brag.

Hmm, yeah, but
somehow, you manage.

Raj, you should have Howard
join you for one of your shows.

Oh, that might be fun.

But... it might be, but with
two small children at home

and a full-time job,
I'm sure you're too busy.

No, I could find the time.

Well, you don't have
to decide right now. It's okay, I...

He can't do it.

Hey, hurry up, guys.

The gift shop's closing,
and Amy said

I can get one big thing
or two little things.

So I'm gonna place the sensory
isolation helmet on you

for about five minutes.

All you need to do
is sit still and relax.

What do I do if I start
to get claustrophobic?

Oh, the helmet will sense that
and stop the experiment.

Really?

No, but that would
be cool, wouldn't it?

Amy, are you busy?

I've got a subject wired up
for a sensory study.

So...

Yes, I'm busy.

Oh.

I'm tracking a subject's
brain activity

in real time as we
introduce olfactory stimuli.

I'm smelling baby powder.

That's just my husband.

Well, I had a thought about
our super-asymmetry theory.

Let me show you this one thing.

Well, I... I want to see it,

but not when I'm in the middle
of an experiment.

Still baby powder!

Boy, he is annoying.

Do any of those
buttons shock him?

Look, I'm really excited
about our paper, too,

but I've got
a lot of my own work

to catch up on,
so let's talk later.

Okay, I'll just say one
more thing: lambda calculus.

And if that wets your whistle,
you know where to find me.

Boop.

You okay? You seem distracted.

I'm... I'm just thinking about Raj.

I'm thinking about
Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.

He sort of hurt my feelings.

Biceps, hammer, abs.
Still in it.

Why wouldn't he want me to be
in his planetarium show?

And it's gone.

Sorry, it's just the director
of the planetarium thought

it'd be fun for me to join Raj
for one of his shows,

and he made it clear
that he didn't want me to.

Of course he wouldn't
want you to.

I mean, think about it.
If you were him,

would you want to
share the stage

with a sexy-ass astronaut?

I don't know.
How sexy are we talking?

Oh, you know, tight pants,

huge biceps, magic hammer.

-Wait, w... who are we talk...
-Shh, I'm back in it.

The fundamental problem

with elementary quantum
mechanical formalism

is that the Fourier transform

extends to minus
infinity in time.

Hey, don't dumb
this down for me.

Penny, I'm...

late for that thing. See you.

Leonard!

Oh, Sheldon.
Didn't see you there. What's up?

Well, uh, he was
excited to talk science

with Amy,
but she was working late,

so he decided to come over
and share it with me.

With me, Leonard.

With me.

Sheldon,
we've talked about this.

You can't go around
boring other people's wives.

Yeah.

I already got a man for that.

-Yeah, you do.
-Yeah.

It's just, I've
just been enjoying

my collaboration with Amy,

but ever since we got back
from our honeymoon,

she has so little time.

Well, she does have her own job.

Yeah, but it's so dull.

Trying to understand
how the brain

translates the five senses
into biochemical information.

I'd rather wait in line
without my phone.

Okay, well, Leonard's here now.

You can talk science with him.

Where you going?

Oh, that thing
you were late for.

One of us should
really be there.

Hey. Got a sec?

Sure. What's up?

I just want to let
you know I get

why you don't want me to be
a part of the planetarium show.

Oh, great.
Thanks for stopping by.

You don't want to talk
about the stars

next to an actual astronaut.

That would be like doing
karaoke with a rock star.

First of all,

I've totally done
karaoke with a rock star.

Or are you forgetting
when the Spin Doctors

handed me the mic
at the Orange County Fair?

Listen, I understand
you being intimidated,

but I can't help that I'm
proud of being an astronaut.

It's a big deal.

Oh, it certainly is,
but I also happen to be

very accomplished in my field.

Great.

So you have no
reason to be scared

of sharing the spotlight.

Please. I may be scared
of heights and spiders

and showing up
at a costume party

that turns out
to be a regular party,

but I am not scared of sharing
the spotlight with you!

What's happening?

I just stormed out
for dramatic effect.

I... actually, I... I don't have
anywhere to go.

President Siebert,

how much do you
know about physics?

I'm a physicist.

Huh. I would not
have guessed that.

I have a doctorate
from Indiana University.

Oh, that makes more sense.

Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.

Thank you.

Dr. Fowler and I have
been working on

a theory of super-asymmetry
that could reconcile

the lack of observation
of super-symmetry

in a world still governed
by string theory.

Interesting.

So you're taking the
paradigms of super-symmetry,

but removing the limitations

of obeying the Poincare algebra.

Well, aren't you just
the pride of Bloomington?

What do you want, Sheldon?

Dr. Fowler has
found herself distracted

by the commitments
in her own lab.

It would be a great
help to both of us

if you could free her up
from her other projects.

I'm confused.

Yeah, well, there's
that Indiana.

This is physics research.
Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.

Y... yes, but her insights
into the very ways

we conceptualize symmetry

and asymmetry have
been invaluable.

Dr. Cooper...

L... look, I know what
you're thinking,

that 'they're newly-weds',

how are they gonna keep
their hands off of each other?'

Let me assure you,

we will not engage
in workplace coitus.

Okay, if I won't
put a bagel on my desk,

I'm certainly not putting
Amy's bare bottom.

I... I must say,

I do not enjoy our talks.

Dr. Park, may I help you?

Actually, yes, do you have any
better notes on this project?

I'm having a hard time
reading your handwriting.

Oh, uh, allow me
to rephrase that.

What the hell are
you doing in my lab?

I'm sorry, I was reassigned
to this project.

I was told you were taking
a temporary sabbatical

to focus on other work.

N... no, that... that's crazy.

This is my research.

-Oh, Amy, there you are.
-No, not...

Not now, Sheldon, I'm
dealing with an epic screw-up,

and when I find out
who's responsible,

they're gonna get an earful.

All right, well,
when you're done, let me know,

I've got some exciting news.

I'm sorry, I'm confused.
President Siebert said

you were focusing on
some important physics work

and I should take over
your lab in the interim.

Uh, hey, that was
my exciting news.

All right, I'm gonna
tell you again.

Pretend you haven't heard it.

You got me removed
from my own project?

Yeah, and it wasn't easy.

Apparently, you're very
difficult to replace.

Hey, just between you and me,

they consider Dr. Park
quite the step down.

I was trying to pick
my moment to leave.

This seems like it.

Wow. Banker's hours.

No wonder you're not
on the tenure track.

Sheldon, you had no right.

What... I thought you said
you were spread too thin.

You said that you wished
you had more time to focus

on our research.
I thought I was helping.

Well, you're not.

I mean, I have years
invested in this work,

and now someone's gonna
come in and take it over?

I mean, how would you feel
if I let Leonard take over

your super-asymmetry project?

That's funny.

Oh, he'd be like a puppy
with a microscope.

If I had a nickel for every
time a charity sent me a nickel.

Really? That's gonna be
our whole life, huh?

If my father's any
guide, around 50,

I start to lose my hearing
and get two new jokes.

-Hey.
-Hey.

I brought Chinese.

Oh, that's a nice surprise.
What's the occasion?

Please, I don't need a reason
to bring food to my friends.

But you have one, don't you?

Yeah, I need your help.

All right, lay it on us.

So, I folded,

and I told Howard
he could be a part

of my planetarium show.

And now I'm worried
he's just gonna

make the whole thing
about himself.

So just tell him
you changed your mind

and you don't want him to do it.

No, no, then he's gonna think
I'm too insecure

to share the spotlight with him.

And he'd be right.

Come on. I came here
for your support.

Well, then, you just walked up

three flights of stairs
for nothing.

Wait, don't you mean
four flights?

No, it's actually three.

But we're on the fourth floor.

I mean, you have the lobby, first
floor, second, third, fourth.

The lobby's the first floor,
so lobby, second, third, fourth.

That does not seem right.

Hello...

Sorry, Raj, who cares if
Howard tries to steal the show?

All right? You're great
at what you do.

Just be the bigger man.

And if it makes you feel better,
Penny and I will come

so you'll have a couple of
friendly faces in the audience.

Thank you.
That would be nice.

Can you just...
Sorry, give me a minute?

Hey, Raj, if I had a
nickel for every time

a charity sent me a nickel...

That's hilarious!

I know.

It's three, right?

Just shut up.

Oh, good, we caught you.

Yes, good.

You had no right
to reassign my project.

Yeah, no right at all.

Dr. Fowler,
I don't understand.

Dr. Cooper assured me
this is what you wanted.

Oh... oh! Can you
believe this guy?

Oh, sure,

so a couple of men get together
behind closed doors

to decide the fate
of a woman's career.

I thought we'd moved past this.

Sheldon, this is your fault.

Ooh, sounds like the old lady's

putting me in the
doghouse tonight.

Dr. Fowler, you are very
important to this university

and I would like
to sincerely apologize.

So I can have my project back?

-I'm afraid it's not that simple.
-Why not?

Well, in order
to free up personnel...

Hey, hey, don't go
mansplaining things to her.

I don't think that's
what he was doing.

Oh, then perhaps
you don't understand.

See, mansplaining is when
a man explains things

to a woman like she's stupid.

Boop.

So when was the last time

you saw Howard in his
astronaut uniform?

About a week ago.

Really? What was
the occasion?

Date night.

We do a little role-playing.

What role do you play?

I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,

lonely Russian cosmonaut
who is expert at physics

and making love.

Okay, that just made
the next hour really weird.

Good evening,

I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

and usually I take you on
a trip through the stars,

but tonight,

we'll begin our journey
much closer to home,

220 miles straight up to the
International Space Station,

which is manned by a team
of brave men and women.

Flexible men and women.

Switch with me.

And we are fortunate

to have one of those men
here with us tonight.

Please welcome to
the Griffith Observatory

astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.

Kak horosho.

-What is she ta...
-Don't ask.

Thank you, Raj, that was
a really nice introduction.

Well, it's from my heart.

So, Howard,

you are in an elite group.

Only 232 people have ever been

on the International
Space Station.

How does that
make you feel?

Honestly, lucky.

Most astronauts have to
train their whole lives.

I was just in the right
place at the right time.

Oh, please, luck had
nothing to do with it.

You people need to know
how impressive this man is.

He was up there because
he's the only one qualified

to install a piece of
equipment that he designed.

Thanks, but if you want
to talk impressive,

this guy right here
discovered a planetary object

outside the Kuiper belt.

He worked on the Mars rover.

He helped launch the
New Horizons space probe.

He went to space
on a Russian rocket.

And I was scared the whole time.

And I was scared for you,
but also proud.

Wow. I...

don't think you've ever
said that to me before.

I should have,

and I'm gonna say it again.

I'm proud of you.

You're my best friend,
and I love you.

Aw, Raj, I love you, too.

What is happening?

Bring it in, spaceman,

you've been cleared for landing.

Can you believe these two...
Are you crying?

Hello, Sheldon.

Hello, Arthur.

Now, I'm confused,

usually when you appear
to me in my dreams,

we're on the planet Dagobah.

This is Dagobah.

I didn't know that Dagobah
had delicatessens.

Not good ones.

Whatever you do,

don't order the Reuben.

I'm having a problem
in my marriage.

I've upset my wife

and I don't know how
to make it right.

And you're... and
you're coming to me for advice?

I... I upset my wife every time
I woke up in the morning.

I'm not coming to you,

you're just a manifestation
of my subconscious.

I mean, I'm actually
coming to me.

So you know everything
I'm going to say.

Yes, but it sounds
wiser from you

because you're old and glowing.

Fine.

Rule number one in a marriage:

don't go to bed angry.

That makes sense.

Rule number two in a marriage:

if you don't recognize
the shoes under your bed,

they're not your shoes.

Because they're her shoes?

N... never mind, just...

just go with rule number one.

Thank you, Arthur.

Uh, before you go,
can I ask you a question?

Of course.

Does this look lean to you?

I ordered lean.

Amy. Wake up. Amy.

What? What's wrong?

We can't go to sleep
angry with each other.

Why not?

It's rule number one.

I'd tell you rule number
two, but it's confusing.

Sheldon, go to sleep.

Amy. Amy. Amy.

You cut that out!

Oh, good, you're up.

Sheldon...

I just really don't want to talk
to you about this right now.

That's fine. I just
need you to know

that I feel terrible
about what I did

and I wasn't being malicious.

No, you were being selfish.

You're being selfish right now

'cause it's really late
and I just want to sleep.

No, Professor Proton
came to me in my dream

and said we can't
go to sleep angry.

Are you sure
that's what he said?

Close your eyes, double-check.

Amy, this is important.

Okay,

listen to me.

I love working with you,

but you have to understand
how scary this is for me.

Why?

Because I don't want to get lost
in this relationship.

And when you pulled me
off my project,

it seemed like my biggest
fear was coming true,

the... the things that
are mine are getting...

subsumed into the
things that are ours.

I wouldn't want that
to happen, either.

Thank you for explaining

and for using
the word 'subsume,'

that's one you
don't hear enough.

You're welcome.

-Good night.
-Good night.

What are you doing now?

Looking for shoes.

Why?

When your favourite ghost
tells you to do something,

you do it.

Hey, did you guys
know this year's

the 40th anniversary
of Halloween?

Oh, nonsense. Halloween
traditions date

back to the Celtic
festival of Samhain.

Although our current
Halloween customs

come from the evening
before All Hallows' Day...

All Hallows' Eve...
thus, Halloween.

I meant the movie Halloween.

Oh.

Well, that's not
interesting at all.

Did you know the Michael
Myers mask from the film

was actually a Captain Kirk
mask turned inside out?

Okay, now it's interesting.

Are you guys all
dressing up for work?

Of course.
I mean, how often

do you get to wear
costumes to work?

Says the man with a giant
belt buckle and a dickey.

Hey, this is not a costume.
It's a choice. It's a style.

It's a tragedy.

Bernadette, why don't we
get to dress up at work?

We used to, but a couple guys
in the infectious disease lab

went as zombies and it
triggered a quarantine.

The CDC was so mad.

Hey, if you really want to dress
up, we could throw a party.

Oh, that would be fun.

You know, I used to throw
Halloween parties all the time

when I moved into the building.

All the time? I only remember
being invited to one.

Please don't make this
awkward for me.

Okay, so, Friday night...

-Halloween party here.
-Okay.

Great. Can't wait.

What are you going as?

I don't want to ruin the surprise.
You'll see it at work.

Just a warning:
it's pretty scary.

-Is it a bird?
-No.

-Is it a dog?
-No.

Oh, I think I'll be fine, then.

Hello.

Hello.

I see you are dressed
as Doc Brown

from Back to the Future.

May I assume that Amy is going
as his wife, Clara Clayton,

from Back to the
Future Part III?

She is.

Did you do something
different to your hair?

Yes.

Looking good.

Oh, Inspector Gadget.

And I want to say

Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

So close.

Kooth Bader Ginsburg.

The Notorious KBG.

That's very clever.

Sustained.

Are you gonna dress in drag
in front of your fiancee?

Yeah. We have no secrets
from each other.

Well, except for the fact that
I... I crocheted this myself.

Hey, Sheldon.

-Hello.
-Hello.

Oh, my God,
you look amazing.

I find you guilty of murder,
because you are killing it.

Well, technically, the Supreme
Court wouldn't determine

a defendant's guilt or
innocence in a criminal matter.

They could only reverse
or revamp a jury's conviction

based on a constitutional
or statutory issue.

Why are you laughing?

His statement
was factually correct.

You're sitting in my spot.

You don't have a spot.

-What is wrong with you today?
-Maybe he's cranky

because he's off
his bathroom schedule.

Well, I can understand how that
would make someone irritable.

Interesting fact. 'Irritable'
comes from the Latin,

'susceptible to anger.'

Just because I used a word

doesn't mean
I want its etymology.

Interesting fact. 'Etymology'

comes from the Greek word...

You are being so annoying.
Stop it.

And why are you two laughing?

Sheldon, he's being you.

He's dressed as you
for Halloween.

Oh.

So you're not laughing at him.

You're laughing at me.

We're not laughing at you.
We're laughing with you.

But I'm not laughing.

Then the first one.

Ready to go?

Hey, why aren't you
in your costume?

I just didn't feel like it.

You get that I'm wearing
a corset because of you,

not because I'm tired
of breathing?

Amy, do you think I'm
always correcting other people?

No, not all the time.

I mean, just last week,

Penny ended a sentence
with a preposition.

You didn't even mention it.

True.

I just waited until I got home
and screamed into a pillow.

Is something bothering you?

Howard dressed up as me
and imitated me,

and everyone laughed.

Oh.

Well, that must
have felt terrible.

It did.

I never realized my friends

viewed me as an
object of ridicule.

Oh, I don't think that's true.

They laughed, Amy.

In a derisive way.

Not in the instructive
way I laugh at them

when they're being stupid.

Hey, happy Halloween.

Oh! Trick or treat.

No. Sorry, you're not
wearing a costume.

Yeah, I am. I'm a
pharmaceutical sales rep.

I'm gonna need more.

Okay, failed actress
who traded constant rejection

for a Christmas bonus
and a dental plan?

-Go nuts.
-Oh.

I will.

So, what are you
wearing to the party?

Sexy cat? Sexy nurse?
Sexy zombie?

Why do girls' costumes
have to be sexy

but guys' costumes don't?

Say that again with this
helicopter on my head.

Very cute.

Hey, do you remember
what happened

at that first Halloween party
that you invited me to?

When I threw up in the pumpkin?

More memorable than that.

Really? That was
pretty impressive.

We had our first kiss.

On this very couch.

No, no, our first kiss was
at your birthday.

Remember? I threw you a party,

you didn't make it,
and I felt bad for you.

No, no, it was on Halloween,

and you felt bad for me.

If we're gonna go
through every party

where I felt bad for you,
we're gonna be here awhile.

Never mind.

What? You're not
mad at me, are you?

No. Of course not.
No, we just remember

different things
from that party.

I remember falling in love,

and you remember vomiting
in a pumpkin.

I was, like, four feet away.

People cheered.

-Here you go.
-Thanks.

So, did you see
Howard's costume?

See it? I made it.
It was hilarious.

Well, Sheldon didn't think
so, and neither did I.

Oh, come on.
It was all in good fun.

Well, I'm sure it was,
but Sheldon's feelings got hurt.

May... maybe Howard
could apologize?

You're kidding, right?

Sheldon didn't
apologize when he said

my baby looked like
Winston Churchill.

He loves Churchill.

Your son should take that
as a compliment.

He said it about my daughter.

Well, this isn't about Sheldon.

This is about Howard.

I think it is about Sheldon.

How many times has
he made fun of Howard

for being an engineer?
Going to MIT?

His magic?

Sheldon doesn't make fun
of his magic.

Well, he should. It's stupid.

Anyway, the point is,

Sheldon shouldn't dish it out
if he can't take it.

I think the point is that
Howard owes him an apology.

Yeah, well, I think the point is

if Sheldon has a problem
with Howard,

Sheldon should take it up
with him.

Mama.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

the prime minister of England
needs her diaper changed.

Hey.

Oh, that's great.

He's a Supreme Court justice,

and you're the
U.S. Constitution.

Yep. He interprets me.

And guess what's
underneath this?

The Bill of Tights.

Smart, funny, gorgeous...
are we a match or what?

Hey, Bert, what
are you dressed as?

I'll give you a hint.

My work in seismic refraction
measurements and...

Hey, Stuart,
what are you dressed as?

I'm a butterfly.

Did you steal those from
Halley's 'let's pretend' box?

I'm gonna put them back.

All right, I'll tell you.

I'm Maurice 'Doc' Ewing,

winner of the 1960
Vetlesen Prize,

generally regarded
as the Nobel Prize of geology.

Oh, yeah. Now I see it.

Ask me how I died.

Spolier alert: Brain haemorrhage.

Well, Gorblimey.

You look like a
thousand tuppence.

Don't he, Mary Poppins?

Are you gonna talk
like that all night?

Jiff Willikers, I am.

Isn't he cute?

He's gonna get a
spoonful of sugar later.

And I'm gonna sweep
Ms. Poppins' chimney.

So, here we are.

On Halloween.

On this couch.

Does it ring any bells?

Really? We're still doing this?

I'm just surprised you don't
remember our first kiss.

Fine. It was on Halloween.

Are you agreeing
just to shut me up?

You got another way?
I'm all ears.

Really? An arranged marriage?

Yeah.
I know how it sounds.

It sounds awesome.

Is that just an Indian thing,

or can I get a piece of that?

You know the woman
has a choice, right?

There's always a catch.

Happy Halloween.

Who wants to see a magic trick?

Oh, that's right.
No one.

Ha! They're you.

What do you think you're doing?

I thought it was clear.

I'm being unnecessarily hurtful
but with a sweet voice.

And I don't understand
what's going on

because I went to MIT.

Okay, guys, I think
that's enough.

Hold on. I'm
the judge here,

and I'm going to allow it.

Raj, take a break.

Hey, free speech.

Right back there somewhere.

You know what, guys?

You got us. Congratulations.
Now why don't you go back

to your apartment and put
on your other costumes.

Oh, but it's so far away,

and I have such
teeny, tiny legs.

Really? Our bodies?
Is that where we're going, Amy?

What's wrong with my body?

Well, for starters, you
have a quarter in your nose.

Not now, Sheldon.

I don't get invited
to a lot of parties.

Is this a good one?

Oh, yeah.

Did that guacamole
taste weird to you?

Tasted weird to me.

Can't believe Amy did that.

Oh, come on. You
thought it was funny

when I dressed up as Sheldon.

That was totally different.

-How?
-That didn't hurt my feelings.

Well, for what it's worth,

I didn't think it was a
very good impression of you.

Really?

You don't think I have an
annoying high-pitched voice?

No, not at all.

In fact, I find your voice
quite melodious.

Mm-hmm.

And you don't think
I'm unnecessarily hurtful?

What? I'm sorry. I...
I couldn't hear the question.

I just heard the music.

Well, people came,
they ate, they vowed

to never speak
to each other again.

I think it was
a successful party.

It was.

And I'm sorry about earlier.
I know it doesn't matter.

No, it does matter.

Okay? You were right.

It was Halloween.

I was dressed as a cat,
you were a hobbit.

It was right there
on that couch.

Why didn't you just say that?

Because I always hated
that was our first kiss.

I was drunk, and I was
still with Kurt, and I was...

using you to make
myself feel better. I...

just wanted our first
kiss to mean something.

That's why I said it was
the one on your birthday.

I like that.

We'll make that
our official first kiss.

Thank you. Aw.

That was beautiful.

-Mm.
-What are you still doing here?

I was in the bathroom.

Guacamole didn't agree with me.

Well, since you're here,
you can help us clean up.

-Will you take this out, please?
-Sure.

Thank you.

It's late.

Would you mind if I
crashed here tonight?

You are always welcome here.

-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

Where were we?

I think Howard
hurting my feelings

has in some ways made
me a better person.

Hmm.

Look at you, improving on perfection.
How so?

As you were eating
that Danish, I wanted

to point out that the
Danish isn't Danish at all.

It was imported
by Austrian bakers

during a labour dispute
in the 1800s.

But I chose not to,

because I didn't want to be
the kind of fella

who foists unwanted facts
about European pastries

on the unwilling.

Huh. That's actually
interesting.

Sorry. Now you'll never know.

Hey, guys, I need your help.
Bernadette's still...

pretty upset
about your costumes.

She's upset?

Those pants I wore to make
fun of you were so tight,

I risked a testicular hernia.

Anyway,

if you guys could apologize,
it'd be a big help.

Oh, we'd be happy
to apologize to her

as soon as she apologizes to me

for not making you
apologize to Sheldon.

I didn't follow that,

but, then, between my wife
and that guacamole,

I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

Don't you think
it's unreasonable

for her to ask us to do
something she refused to do?

Yes. So when can you
stop by?

I don't understand.
If it's unreasonable,

why should we do it?

Okay, how about this?
You know in Star Wars

when R2 and Chewbacca
were playing holo-chess?

Really? Star Wars?

Amy, let the man speak.

Well, Chewbacca was losing
and getting angry and...

W... w... wait.

Are you saying we should
let the Wookiee win?

Hey.

Hey, that's my wife
you're talking about.

But yes, let the Wookiee win.

Hello, Bernadette.

Wait, did you just walk
into my house?

No, Howard let me in.

Where is he?

Oh, he got in his car
and drove away.

Oh.

Is that watermelon for anybody?

It's for Halley.

Is she gonna eat all of it?

God, no wonder
she looks like Churchill.

What do you want, Sheldon?

Howard said your
feelings were hurt.

Well, Howard's wrong.

I don't care if someone
makes fun of me.

All right.

Apparently I came
all this way for nothing.

Unless Halley wants to
share that watermelon?

You think Amy's the first person

to make fun of me for
having a squeaky voice?

Do you?

I feel like my chance
at watermelon

is dangling by a thread.

She's not. It's been
happening my whole life.

And... and she called me
out for being mean?

Well, I've had to be mean.

It's hard to be taken seriously

when you're always
the smallest person in the room.

I know that.

I was in high school
when I was nine years old.

I tried to tell the other kids

that although my physical
stature was small,

my intellectual stature
towered over them.

That only seemed
to make things worse.

The kids called me
Bernadette the marionette.

Because you're small.
That's funny.

No, it's not.

Well, people used
to call me egghead

'cause there were eggs
on my head.

'Cause they threw them at me.

That's terrible.

One time my brothers
made me breathe helium.

I tried to call for help,

but the only one who
could hear me was the dog.

That's also terrible.

My goodness, you had to
live in a house with a dog.

I guess we both had to put up
with a lot of crap from people.

I suppose we have. Huh.

Maybe you and I are more
alike than we thought.

Maybe we are.

Although I'm exceptionally tall,
and you're exceptionally...

-Sheldon.
-You didn't even let me finish.

-Fine. Sorry.
-Short.

Sheldon, you sure
you're ready for this?

This movie's pretty scary.

Please. I'm an adult.
I think I can handle it.

That's what you said about the
butterfly pavilion at the zoo.

That was my fault.
After I pet that goat,

I felt like a gladiator.

Okay, lights on, or lights off?

Lights off. If I'm gonna
do this, I want to do it right.

What do you guys think
you're doing?

We're showing Sheldon Halloween.

Absolutely not.
Sheldon, come home.

But I really want to watch it.

I know you do,
but I am forbidding it.

Oh, man. Sorry, guys.

What took you so long?

I'm sorry. I just got your text!

Oh, this is amazing.

I wish I had a playhouse
like this when I was a kid.

Really? You never
had a playhouse?

No.

I mean, my dad did buy
the house next door

for us to play in.

I'm gonna hook up the garden
hose, so it has running water.

Why does it need running water?

Same reason
it's got electricity:

Bernadette and I both work,
and we're overcompensating.

This reminds me of a
traditional Amish barn raising.

With everyone pitching in.

How exactly are you pitching in?

I don't hear anyone
else giving facts

about traditional
Amish barn raising.

The rest of us are pitching in
with hammers and nails.

Well, facts are my nails,
and my voice is the hammer

which pounds them through
the wood of your skull.

Well, that is how it feels.

Hey, uh, can you
pass me that drill?

Yeah, fun fact
about Amish barn raising...

they don't use any power tools.

Amy, make him stop.

No.

If he tires himself out now,
he'll sleep better tonight.

Hey, Howie, can
you give me a hand?

I need to get some work done,

and the kids are climbing
all over me.

You know what?
I'll watch them.

You sure?

But I was just about
to tell everyone

why they're called
Pennsylvania Dutch

when they really hail
from Germany.

Yep.

Thanks.

So, what do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

And when our kids outgrow it,

we can Airbnb it
to other people's babies.

Funny.

You all right?

Sorry, I haven't had
a second to myself.

So let me just go back
inside, finish my report,

brush my teeth, change out of
my pyjamas, make a sandwich,

and then I'll come out here
and laugh at your joke.

Ooh. As long as you're
making sandwiches...

You can laugh
at that one later, too.

All right, I've kept you
in suspense long enough.

'Dutch' is a bastardization
of the word 'Deutsch,'

meaning German.

What's German for 'annoying'?

Nervig. Why do you ask?

President Siebert,
you wanted to see me?

Hey. There's my guy!

You sound like my wife

just before she asked
me to go to Coachella.

No, this is gonna be
way more fun than Coachella.

More fun than heatstroke?
Good luck.

So, there are some funds left

in the general
administrative grant,

and I need somebody to decide

how we should disburse them.

Really?

W... wow, what an honour.
Thank you.

So how do I decide
who gets the money?

How do you decide anything?

Think about it with your brain,

and then say it with your mouth.

Yeah, right, sure.
Uh, so, after I decide,

do I then submit it to you
for approval, or...?

No. You decide,
you approve,

and then you pride yourself
on a job well done.

That's a lot of responsibility.

Well, if I didn't think
you were up to the task,

you wouldn't have
been fifth on my list.

Thank you. I... I'll get
started right away.

And I look forward
to hearing nothing about it.

I will keep you posted.

Hey, thank you guys again

for helping out yesterday.

No problem. That was really fun.

It was fun. But I am sore.

You didn't lift a finger.

No, but I narrated
the entire event,

and I am paying for it today.

-Gentlemen.
-Hey. -Hi.

Leonard, do I detect a
little swagger in your step?

Mm, possibly.

Well, stop.
It doesn't suit you.

What's going on?

Well, Siebert put me in charge

of handing out the last bit
of the administrative funds,

and I have sole discretion.

Ooh! Looks like
Christmas came early.

First thing on my list
is a golden umbrella,

'cause Leonard's
gonna make it rain!

Uh, hold on, I'm not
just gonna hand out money.

There's a procedure
you need to follow.

I believe he's referring

to the traditional
'kissing of the buttocks.'

Should we form a line,

or just do it like
we're bobbing for apples?

Cute, but President Siebert
trusted me with this,

and I'm taking it seriously.

If you have a
legitimate request,

you can submit it
to me in writing,

and I'll evaluate it
based on its merits.

Sure, sure. Is 'Jet Ski'
one word or two?

Hofstadter!

Heard Siebert put you in charge
of the administrative fund.

Can't think of a
better guy for the job.

I think he's done this before.

Leonard, I know
you and I have a...

oh, troubled history,

but I hope that when
I make my request

you'll give me a fair shot.

Of course.

See? That's why I like
about this guy: integrity.

Bring it in!

I just put something
in your pocket.

It's good at all El Pollo Locos.

Halley, leave your
brother's dirty diaper alone.

Put that down.
That is not a hat.

That is not
a hat! Oh!

-Okay. Everybody in the sink.
-Oh.

Bad news, Howie.

I'm gonna be stuck
at work for a while.

Oh, that's terrible.
Hang in there.

I'll be home as soon as I can.

Ah...

He deserves better.

No, I'm not going to reconsider.

Your request was denied.

I don't care
if it helps you think;

you don't need a koi
pond in your office.

Well, you should
have thought about that

before you bought the koi!

Wow. That was
a little rough.

Well, I have to be.

Everyone assumes I'm just gonna

give them whatever they want.

Hmm. But you're not, are you?

No, I'm not.
I mean, look at this.

An espresso machine?
I don't think so. Denied!

Wow, I really like
this side of you.

Really?

Yeah, just so decisive.

Well, check this out.

A standing desk. Denied!

Oh!

If you want to stand,

do it on your own time,
'cause I'm the boss.

Yeah, you are.

Hello.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Leonard, I just wanted
to congratulate you

on how well you are
managing this grant money.

What do you want?

Nothing. I just came by
to pay you a compliment.

Nice try.
The answer's no.

To what? I'm not
asking you for anything.

All I need for my job
is right here. Hmm?

This is my office. Which
makes for a great commute.

Home, work, home.

I'm still working...
I'm just working from home.

You know, if it's that easy,
then why does Leonard

have to drive you
to work every day?

Because I like the frozen yogurt
machine in the cafeteria.

Ooh, I suppose I could use
a frozen yogurt machine...

Denied!

Oh, you should have seen him...

denying things left and right.

It was so sexy.

'Course, I made a
request he did not deny.

Uh-huh.

Are you listening to me?

Yeah, sure. You slept
with your husband.

What is going on with you?

It's not a big thing.

Have you ever told Leonard
a little white lie?

Mm.

Well, he thinks I've seen

every one of the
Star Wars movies,

but I've really only seen
the one with the gold robot.

That could be any of them.

Exactly.

I've been telling Howie
that I've had to work late

the past couple nights, but...

really, I've just been hiding
out in Howie's playhouse.

Does that make me awful?

-Awful?
-No.

Uh, strange? Yes.

Sad? A little, yes.

It's just that
work's been crazy,

and the minute I get
home, I have two kids

hanging on me,
and sometimes I don't want

babies pulling my hair
and pinching my belly fat.

That'd be a good slogan
for a condom company.

I love my kids,
but that hour to myself

just makes me feel human again.

So, you go home
and sit alone in a toy house

in the backyard?

Yeah!

Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
did you have a chance

to look over my proposal?

I did, and your
research is fascinating.

I had no idea that
crows were that smart.

Do they really hold grudges?

They do.

One of them escaped from my

behavioural study a year ago.

I can't prove it's him,

but something craps
on my car every day.

Well, look, I only
have enough money

to fund one request,
but your project

is definitely in the running.

Okay, but, uh, when do you think

you might make a decision?

Because I have to
upgrade their cages

before they learn
how to open the locks.

When I came in to
my lab this morning,

they suddenly got silent.

I think they're
planning something.

Um, soon. I've narrowed it
down to three projects.

Ooh, is mine one of them?

Actually, yeah.

The software in
the telescope room

hasn't been upgraded in years,

and it seems like
it might be time.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

So you're just gonna give
the money to your friend?

I smell a rat.

I work with rats, too.
That might be me.

I'm not just giving it
to my friend, Barry.

Your proposal is
also in the mix.

Wait, so those are the three?

You're not
even considering mine?

Why, because they're PhDs
and I'm just an engineer?

No, because they wrote
detailed proposals,

and you sent a YouTube clip

of the guy from Jerry Maguire

saying, 'Show me
the money!'

All right, Hofstadter,
what's it gonna be?

Which project
are you gonna pick?

Yeah, come on, Leonard.
Tell us now.

But, remember,

crows aren't the only ones
who can hold a grudge.

Look, all three of your
proposals have a lot of merit.

I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

I can tell you're stressed.

If it helps,
I withdraw my proposal.

It doesn't help.

Fine. Then I'm back in the mix.
Show me the money!

Okay, I... I just...
I need everyone to back off.

I'm in charge here,

and I'll decide when
I'm ready to decide.

When will that be?

A day, a week.
I don't know!

-Where are you going?
-I don't know that either!

Ooh.

Someone's making decisions.

I'm reviewing these proposals.

Yeah. 'Cause you're
the boss man,

telling people what's what.

I like it.

It's just so hard!

All... all three of these
proposals have merit.

How do I choose?

Well, not with that voice.

There has got to be
a right decision

based on empirical evidence.

Look, I made pros
and cons lists,

and then I came up with
three different scoring systems

to determine the best project.

I just don't know what
scoring system to use.

So I'm working on
a meta-scoring system

to score the scoring systems,

but the math is
really complicated.

You want me to walk
you through it?

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

Turn that off.
Are you trying to get us caught?

Oh.

So, I've narrowed it down
to three worthwhile projects,

but I only have the money
to fund one of them.

Lucky for you,

I have a solution.

I can't wait.

You free up more money
and I fund all of them.

Mm, no.

Or...

hear me out...

yes.

That way, e... everybody's happy.

You can't make everybody happy.

-I think I can.
-You can't.

-Well, actually...
-You're making me unhappy.

Okay, what would you do?

I'd find some sap
and put him in charge

so I wouldn't have
to be the bad guy.

That's a really good id... oh.

Whatcha doin'?

You scared me.

I'll ask again.

What-cha doin'?

Nothing.

Really?

You and Bernadette
aren't doing stuff without me?

What? No! Why would
you even say that?

You know how your talent

is getting just drunk
enough to have a good time

without being hungover
the next day?

Thank you.

Well, mine is knowing
when I'm being excluded.

So spill.

I'm... I'm just running
some errands.

Yeah?

-With a bag full of wine?
-I...

Got to stay hydrated.

Try again.

Okay, look, I'm sorry.

We did not mean
to leave you out.

All right? Bernadette has
been feeling fried at home,

so we ended up hanging
out in Halley's playhouse.

Like a secret club?

No! Just, like, a
place to spend time

that we don't tell
anyone else about.

And what would be a
shorter way of saying that?

Secret club.

Well, you really
hurt my feelings.

What can I do to
make it up to you?

I'm in a secret club!

Shh!

Is there some sort
of humiliating initiation?

'Cause I would
literally do anything.

Leonard, you've
been losing to me

in three-dimensional
chess for many years.

You know what would be neat?

If this was some
sort of long con

and one day you say,
'Let's make this interesting,'

put money on it, and reveal

that you actually know
what you're doing.

A very long con indeed.

Checkmate.

Sorry. I'm distracted.

Ooh, aren't you the hustler.

No matter who I
give the funds to,

someone is gonna
be upset with me.

Do you really care
if people are angry at you?

-Of course.
-Interesting.

Why don't you go to the store

and get me some tapioca pudding

or I'm gonna be angry at you.

No.

So it comes and goes?

How do you not care what
people think of you?

It's easy.

I mean, not 'beating you
at chess' easy,

but what is?

Wait,

you can make this decision.

You don't care if
you upset people.

You can pick for me.

I certainly could.

-Oh, great.
-But I won't.

I think this is a learning
opportunity for you.

Sheldon, come on.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I upset you?

-Yes.
-Ask me how I feel about that.

So where does Leonard
think you are?

Oh, I told him I was at yoga.

Well, you are
stretching the truth.

Yeah. Where does
Sheldon think you are?

Oh, Sheldon's
kind of like a dog...

he doesn't really think
about me when I'm gone,

but he's so happy
when I show up.

Ooh.

Who wants an
Easy-Bake quesadilla?

Me!

Ooh, hot.

Shh.

Thanks for letting me
come over and hang.

So Leonard still hasn't
made a decision yet?

No.

And I've really been
laying on the guilt.

Did you break out the sad eyes?

You mean these bad boys?

What do we do?

We're just gonna have to wait
till they go back inside.

Okay, okay. Can
we very quietly

open that second bottle of...

Hey,

don't freak out, but...

I think there's someone
in your playhouse.

Oh. Yeah,
that's just Bernadette.

She's been hiding out
in there all week.

Really? Why?

I don't know.

She's been a little
overwhelmed at work. And,

frankly, me and
the kids are a lot.

She just...

needs some downtime.

And you just pretend
like you don't know?

Sure.

That's how marriage works.

Three years ago...

I told her I got life insurance,

and I totally didn't.

Someday, she's gonna find out.
I'm gonna say,

'Ha-ha! I know you've been
hiding in the playhouse.'

Why don't you just get
the life insurance?

Whose side are you on?

Can you hear
what they're saying?

Shh, I'm trying.

Huh.

Sounds like Penny's
in there, too.

Seriously, Leonard,

you didn't pick my project?

I'm sorry, Raj.

Did you go with Crow Lady?

No.

You gave the money to Kripke?

I did not.

Wait, I'm confused.

I thought there were only
three projects in contention.

There were.
But, at the last minute,

someone submitted an application

for a pretty cool
europium-doped laser,

and they made a very
compelling case.

What was the case?

Oh, that it was me
and I wanted it.

You... you can't do that.

You can't just fund
your own project.

Uh, it turns out
I can, and I did.

Interesting.

What about not wanting
everybody to be mad at you?

Well, I realized that,
no matter what decision I made,

people were gonna be mad at me.

And this way, I get a laser.

That is the most selfish
thing you've ever done.

I'm proud of you.

-And I don't care.
-Yes, you do.

Yeah, I do.

The europium laser is so cool.

It has a four-level
f-f transition

which provides for
high power output,

and its quantum efficiency
is off the charts.

What are you going
to use it for?

I have no idea.

Leonard,

there's a crow on your roof.

I see it.

Is that one
of Dr. Lee's crows?

It has a tag on its leg.

Don't make any sudden moves.

Smart. Let's stand
perfectly still and...

He's the one you want!

Hey, you guys have any
plans for Valentine's Day?

-Three months from now?
-No.

What? No?

I mean, secret romantic plans that
would be ruined if I told you.

Oh.

What's going on, Raj?

Well,

how would you guys feel about
going to India for my wedding?

Oh, that's so exciting!

Penny, you will never guess
what I have planned

-for Valentine's Day.
-Uh-huh.

Can I feed peanuts to
the elephants at your wedding?

-That is such a stereotype!
-There won't be any elephants?

Of course there'll be elephants.

It's a stereotype
that you feed them peanuts.

Are you really gonna plan
a wedding in three months?

Yeah, well, her family's
doing most of the work.

They're amazing.
We talk all the time.

Why?

Because we're
about to get married

and they're gonna be my family.

Amy and I are married, and
I never talk to her family.

Really? My parents
love Leonard.

Yeah. And my mom loves
Penny, which is weird,

because I never
knew she could love.

And my dad has
grown to really...

like Howard.

Yeah, there's a nice...

coolness between us.

Hey, guys, before Anu gets here,

can I talk about
the seating situation?

I really don't want her
to sit on the floor.

Oh. No problem.
Bernadette, floor.

Hey!

Yeah, you can't make my
wife sit on the floor.

Fine.

Howard, floor.

Fine, I'll sit on the floor.

Thank you, Penny.

And, Leonard, I was kind of
hoping I could sit next to Anu.

So now I have to sit on the floor?
It's my house.

Why can't Sheldon
sit on the floor?

That might be the dumbest
thing you've ever said.

Guys, guys, there's
a simple solution.

I am not breaking up with her.

All right. Let's
keep thinking.

Hey, everybody, it's Anu.

Hi.

-Hi!
-Welcome!

Oh, I am stuffed!

I should not have eaten
all those dumplings.

I think we should have sex.

Me, too.

Yeah, it's just,
we haven't done it yet,

and I think it's important

to make sure we're compatible
before we get married.

I totally agree.

Oh, just one question.

While we're doing it,
can I leave my shirt on?

You know, the
dumplings, pretty salty.

It doesn't have to be tonight.

How about this weekend?

I can get us a room at my hotel.

Okay. Sounds nice.

We can order
a bunch of room service,

because I'm not eating anything
between now and then.

Aw. Are you worried?

I am not worried.

If anything, I'm overconfident.

Edging into smug.

I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

Oh, it's gonna be
better than fine.

Trust me, I've
had no complaints.

Good to know.

Well, I've had
questions, comments,

some constructive criticism,
but... no complaints.

You're up early.

Huh? Yes. I wanted
to get a jump

on planning
a day of fun for you.

Oh, that's sweet.
What are we doing?

Oh, no. Just you.
I have other plans.

Now, would you prefer to see
The Grinch in 2-D or 3-D?

I don't want to see it at all.

Well, let's go 2-D. No sense
in spending extra money.

What are you gonna be doing?

Being a great husband.

Yeah, you're gonna need
to show your work on that.

After last night,
I got to thinking

that I should have a better
relationship with your family.

I think the one you have
with them is perfect.

I hardly have one at all.

Which is perfect.

Oh, Amy, they're
important to you,

and you're important to me.

Therefore, according to
the transitive property,

they're important to me.

It's the same reason I'm
interested in your big, flat feet.

Well, you know
that my mom can be...

-well, difficult to get along with.
-Which is why

I'm starting with your dad
and working my way up.

All right.
I'm just worried

you might have
a rather unpleasant day.

Yeah, back at ya.
I watched the trailer

for The Grinch...
it looks terrible.

Hi, Sheldon. Oh, good.
You're right on time.

Hi, Daddy. Hey, pumpkin.

Pumpkin? I've been
calling her spaghetti squash.

It's amazing that one woman

can be different vegetables
to different men.

Bye.

Bye.

So, how does this
work with in-laws?

Am I supposed to
be calling you Dad?

Because I don't want to.

-You don't have to.
-Oh, thanks, Larry.

Ooh. That doesn't
sound right.

Maybe I should pick
a vegetable for you.

Hey, Leonard, can you pause
the game for a second?

Uh, hang on. I'm
about to beat Howard.

What? Hey!

What?

He's our friend.

What's up, pal?

I... I don't know how
else to say this, but, um,

Anu and I are going
to have sex tonight.

Yeah...

Do you know how
creepy that sounds?

Yeah...

So, is this the first time?

Yeah.

-How you feeling about it?
-Uh...

to be honest,
I'm pretty anxious.

I mean, this is the
woman I'm marrying...

what if it's no good?

Do we break up?
Do we...

sign on for a lifetime
of mediocre sex?

Just don't put so
much pressure on it.

It's always a little awkward
in the beginning.

I remember the first time
I slept with Penny.

It was bad?

Oh, it was awesome!

I will replay it in my head
until the day I die.

Well, if it helps,
I was really nervous

my first time with Bernie.

Mostly because I was worried
my mom would walk in.

Did she?

Yea... yeah.

I'll tell you one thing.

Lock the door.

Yeah, Raj, you're gonna be fine.

Just break out some
of your Kama Sutra moves.

I don't really know
any of that stuff.

I just pretend I do
to impress women.

And by the way, Anu is Indian...
she's gonna know

there's no sexual position
called a 'screeching lotus.'

Screeching lotus?

Sometimes I get leg cramps.
It's my cover story.

Look, she's probably
nervous, too.

Yeah, what if you're
great and she's bad?

How can she be bad?

Raj, women can be
bad at sex, too.

No, that's silly.

Hey, have you checked
the dates on these?

They're all expired.

You buy candy in a comic book
store, you get what you get.

It's called Lethal Weapon,

but isn't that redundant?

Aren't weapons, by their
very nature, lethal?

I suppose you're right.

Yeah, and don't even get me
started on Unsolved Mysteries.

I didn't get you started
on Lethal Weapon.

All right, this is another one
of my favourite places,

the comic book store.
Feel free to look around.

Vintage comics in back,
vintage candy right here.

What are you guys up to?

Oh, father-in-law,
son-in-law bonding.

It's going great. Look at what
he bought me at the train store.

Yeah, it sounded
louder in the car.

Cool. Can I see it?

Hmm? Sure.

Oh. Interesting.

I think this is one of those
disappearing whistles.

What are you talking about?

Voila!

Amazing.

Where did it go?

Look in your pocket.

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Oh, how did you do that?

Sorry, a magician
never shares his secrets.

I'll give you a hundred bucks.

Sold!

Okay.

Hey.

Where's my wallet?

Voila!

Hey, Penny.

I need your help.
I am freaking out.

Okay, is she there yet?

No, I got here first.
You know...

get the lay of the land.

Raj, it's gonna be okay.
Look, sex isn't

the most important thing
in a relationship.

My first time with Leonard
was nothing to write home about.

Really?

Yeah, but, you know,
over time it got better.

S... so practice makes perfect?

Well, practice makes better.

Oh, my God, oh, my God,

she just texted.
She's on her way up!

Raj, calm down.
You got this.

Yes. Thank you, thank you.
I got this.

Just remember, the most
important thing is to have fun.

Stop putting so
much pressure on me!

Hi.

Everything okay?

Why are you acting so weird?

Raj? What's going on?

Be right out!
You look beautiful!

Sorry, I had to
use the facilities.

With a bottle of champagne?

Mm, I like to celebrate
the little things in life.

You need to go?
There's still some left.

Raj, what is going on?

No, no, it's not what's going
on, it's what's comin' off.

Stop it.

You're acting weird,
and it's freaking me out.

Why? Because I couldn't talk
and ran in the bathroom

to slug back a
bottle of champagne

when I pretended to pee?

Okay, I think I'm gonna leave.

No, no, wait, wait,
don't... okay, don't go.

Fine. Then tell me
what's going on.

Well, funny story...

The truth.

Oh, God, the truth is
so not good for me!

Voila.

Darn it.

It's okay. Here, let
me show you again.

It's like you're actually magic.

You can do that but you
still can't get my bra off.

The rings don't roll
their eyes at me.

Excuse me, Turnip,
we need to get going.

But... but Howard was gonna show me
some close-up magic.

Well, if you want
to see real magic,

I'll take you to Union Station,

home to trains, subways
and buses that,

every half hour... voila.
drive to the airport.

I'd like to stay,
if you don't mind.

Oh, not at all.

Howard. A word.

What's up?

I need you to stop
being so delightful.

What?

I'm supposed to be
bonding with him.

You have your own
father-in-law; leave mine alone.

Tell you what, you take my
father-in-law, I'll take yours.

I don't want your father-in-law.

What if I throw in a quarter?

Do it again.
Do it again.

Mrs. Fowler.

Mrs. Fowler.

Mrs. Fowler.

Sheldon,

what's going on? Where is Larry?

Oh, Turnip's out;
I'm bonding with you.

Okay, you wanted the
truth, here it is.

You have a drinking problem.

No. I, uh, I have
a talking problem,

and a drinking solution.

What does that mean?

Oh, Anu,

for most of my life,

I got so nervous around women

that I couldn't talk
to them without alcohol.

So you've been drunk every time
we've seen each other?

No. No. It hasn't
happened in a long time.

And I really thought
I was over it, but...

I guess...

I... I don't know, I guess I...
I wanted

so much for tonight
to go well, that I...

I stressed myself out.

It came back.

Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

I was embarrassed.

I get that.

If it makes you feel any better,

I've got things I'm
embarrassed about, too.

Really?

Will you tell me one?

Okay. Um...

Ugh. I hate
telling people this.

I don't like music.

What kind of music?

Just all of it.

It sort of seems
like a waste of time.

Even Beyonce?

See, this is why
I don't tell people.

No. Um, it's fine.
It's just,

have you heard 'Single Ladies'?

Yeah, and I don't get it.

I mean, the lyrics are
'Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.'

Y... you have to sing it in
the voice of a goddess.

# Oh, wa-ah, oh

# Wa-ah, oh

# Oh, oh, oh

# Wa-ah, oh.

My point is, we both have
our little eccentricities.

Little eccentricities?

One is a deep-seated
psychological disturbance,

and the other can be solved by
half a glass of Chardonnay.

So the doctor prescribed Nizoral
and it blocked enzyme action,

and the fungus cleared right up.

That's a very
disturbing picture.

Yes, well, they say a picture's
worth a thousand words,

but I say nothing beats a
picture and a thousand words.

Still, you might want
to take it off Facebook.

Oh, no. It's in my
nature to share.

So, your turn.

Uh, other than Amy,

have you every had anything
removed from your body?

I am not going to answer that.

Smart. Save something for
our next get-together.

Oh, we should commemorate
this one with a selfie.

Oh,

look at us, two peas in a pod.

Oh, speaking of vegetables,

how about I start calling you
Old Lady Green Beans?

Hey, you look deep in thought.

Ah, I'm just reflecting.

About what?

The first time
we slept together.

Oh, honey. Don't beat
yourself up; it's great now.

This is not good.

Sheldon is hanging out
with my mom.

Yeah. O... one sec.

W... what do you mean,
'don't beat myself up'?

Guys, focus.

My mom thinks
that Sheldon is the reason

I don't spend a lot
of time with her.

Well, why would she think that?

Because I told her.

You need a cup of coffee?
Wake up!

So you've been using
Sheldon as an excuse

to get out of
seeing your mother?

I know.

I feel terrible.

I love my mom but,

you know, sometimes...

Yeah. We... we've met her. Yeah.

And it's easier to say
I can't spend time with her

because of Sheldon than
to admit that I just,

I don't want to.

Totally understandable.

I'll ask again,
what do you mean,

'don't beat myself up'?

And then you ask me 20
questions to try to determine

which Nobel Prize-winning
physicist I am.

Ready? Go.

Can I give up?

No.

19 questions left.

Are you gonna get that?

Oh, no. We're in the
middle of a game.

18 questions left.

Answer the phone, Sheldon.

Hello, Amy.

Hey, how's it going?

Well, Howard lured your
dad away with magic,

so now I'm bonding
with your mom.

I think she likes me.

I'd like you a lot better

if you weren't keeping
my daughter away from me.

Uh, wh... hang on, Amy.

What's the problem, Green Beans?

Amy said she couldn't come
to Thanksgiving dinner

because you always have
to spend it with your mother.

I haven't spent Thanksgiving
with my mother in years.

Amy, why would you tell
your mother

that I spend Thanksgiving
with my mother?

Uh, no time
to talk about that now.

All your action figures
are on fire.

Harrison Ford's in the lobby.
Come quick.

And Amy never joins us
for Sunday dinners

because you refuse to go
out on a school night.

Sh... I can go out
on a school night

as long as I'm in
my PJs by 10:00.

Sheldon, don't listen to her.

She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

She's crazy!

Hello, Amy.

Hello, Mother.

Great news.

We... we can come for
Thanksgiving this year.

I can't believe it.

All this time
I've been angry at you

when I should have
been angry at Amy.

Look at that. We're
both angry at Amy.

Maybe that's something
we could bond over.

Let me ask you this:

how do you feel about Howard?

Oh, is he that odd little friend
you have with the haircut?

I may have married
the wrong Fowler.

Why would Amy feel
the need to lie to me?

Well, perhaps because
you're her mother

and she didn't want
to disappoint you.

Really?

Even after she threw
you under the bus,

you're still gonna defend her.

Oh, yes.

She's my wife and I love her.

And if I can forgive her for
putting ketchup on her eggs,

I can forgive her for this.

Her father does that,
it's disgusting.

Amy's crazy, you are a delight.

Good morning.

Mm. Good morning.

I ordered some coffee for us.

Oh, fantastic.

Last night was...

wonderful.

But all we did was talk.

Yeah. And it was wonderful.

Am I safe to assume
you talking to me now

is a good sign for our marriage?

Yeah, and... and for my liver.

Hey, about the other thing.
Um...

Should we just wait
for another night?

Or I go take a shower,

and you decide how
you want to play this.

Take a shower with me, Raj.

Thank you, Amy.

It's so nice of you
to have us over for dinner.

Couldn't think of a
single reason not to.

Yeah, and boy, did she try.

Thank you, honey.

Oh, you're welcome, dear.

Would anyone like to see the
magic trick Howard taught me?

I'd love to see
your trick, Daddy.

A perfectly ordinary
table knife.

Watch closely.

Voila!

Oh, my gosh, that was so good.

Well, look, there's
fake blood, too.

I'll be right back.

I don't know about you,
but I don't really like magic.

You just keep getting
better and better.

Sheldon, do you want to put
the tables after each section

or in an appendix at the end?

You know what?
We wrote this paper together.

I think we should
decide together

that they go in an
appendix at the end.

How about that?
There is an 'I' in 'team.'

Look at what we made.

I know.

It really is the best
of both of us.

It's got my math
and your sassy take-down

of the fundamental
nature of symmetry.

It's got my bottomless
intellectual curiosity

and your petulant refusal

to spell 'Gray' with an 'a'
like an American.

You realize we still have
a lot of work to do

before we can publish.

Perhaps we should
divide and conquer.

Now, you track down
all the citations

and properly note them
in our bibliography,

and I will roll up my sleeves

and decide what font
we want to use.

Sheldon, there are hundreds
of citations to track down.

And thousands of fonts, but
you don't hear me complaining.

I am not gonna spend weeks

in a library looking
up old papers.

Can't we hire
a grad student to do it?

Yeah, a grad student?

I am not trusting
our unpublished paper

to some millennial.

They'll put unicorn emojis on it

and then post it
on social media.

Why would they do that?

Economic anxiety, too much
avocado toast, who cares?

Look, the point
is, we can't afford

to have this paper leaked
before we're ready to publish.

That's how you kiss
the Nobel Prize good-bye

instead of hello
as I intend to do.

I assume you mean
metaphorically.

Absolutely not. If the King
of Sweden hands me a medal,

I intend to smear it with
Purell and then kiss it.

But what if we ask one
of our friends to help us out?

How about Leonard?

Gee, I don't know.
Can we trust him?

He's your best friend
in the whole world.

Yes, but he's always struck me

as the guy in the plane
crash who doesn't wait

until you're all the
way dead to eat you.

I think you can trust him.

Oh, Amy, you never lose
that childlike innocence.

Leonard, I need
to tell you something.

I'm having an affair.

Okay.

You have to swear
not to tell anybody.

Okay.

You are the only one who knows.

Uh, well, you and Rita,
the cafeteria lady

who has been giving me
more than Tater Tots.

Hey, Sheldon.

Not a word.

What did he want?

Oh, nothing. He just
concocted some stupid test

to see if I can keep a secret.

Ooh, what's the secret?

I'm not gonna tell you that.

The test is stupid,
but I still want to pass.

Congratulations, Leonard, you
passed my secret loyalty test.

The truth is, I was
never having an affair

with the cafeteria lady.

There's only one woman who
gets to touch my no-no parts,

and she's right here.

-Sheldon.
-No, no.

Well, I am shocked, Sheldon,

because I totally believed
that the woman you reported

for being stingy with the peas
couldn't keep her hands off you.

Well, I am a little hurt
that you weren't gonna tell me

my husband was having an affair.
I thought we were friends.

I didn't really believe him.

Why not? You don't think
other women find him attractive?

No.

I suppose you're wondering why
I put you through all this.

You mean the last two
minutes or the last 20 years?

We need to ask you a big favour.

Well, you've certainly
gone about it the right way.

You know we're almost
finished with our paper;

we just need help tracking
down the citations.

That's busywork. Can't you just
get a grad student to do it?

No, this paper is
incredibly important to us,

and we need someone
we can trust.

Please, it would mean a lot.

Y... you know what? Sure.

The three of us in the library
looking up old papers...

that actually
could be kind of fun.

Oh, no, we won't be there.

It just got more fun.

Bam, took him out.

Now I'm doing a victory
dance to celebrate.

Where are you?

About to shoot
some dancing jackass.

Hey!

And now I'm doing
a victory dance.

What you playing?

Fortnite.

A bunch of people parachute
onto an island

and fight it out to be
the last man standing.

Like Hunger Games?

More like Bachelor in Paradise,

but not as cut-throat.

Sounds fun. Can I play?

I don't know if you'd like it.
It's kind of for gamers.

Hey, I'm a gamer.
I play Candy Crush, Bejewelled,

and Sesame Street Letter School,

which I beat our daughter at
every single time.

All right, give it a shot.

This one's how you move,
this is how you shoot.

'A' jumps, 'B' puts
you into build mode.

And depending on what
you want to build,

you can use LB, RB, LT, or RT.

Just put me in,
I'll figure it out.

Oh, sounds like me
on our honeymoon.

Okay, you're skydiving down.

You're almost to the ground.

Now, when you land,
you're gonna want...

Okay, you're dead.

Wait, that's it?
That wasn't fun at all.

Oh, now it sounds like
you on our honeymoon.

Thanks for helping with this.

What are friends for?

My friend sent me
down to this basement

to do his grunt work,
so I wouldn't know.

Hey, probably shouldn't
say anything,

but did you hear about
Sheldon and the lunch lady?

Yeah, uh, that's not true.

That's just something
Sheldon made up to test us.

I wish I'd known that
before I called her a floozy

in front of the
whole lunch line.

This is a list of the papers
we need to pull.

Why don't we split up?
You take half, I take half.

I don't know, it's pretty
creepy down here.

Maybe we should stay together.

Come on, Raj,
it's just a library.

You could say that
about anything.

It's just a cemetery.
It's just a haunted house.

It's just a portal to hell.

F... fine, how about we split up

but we stay in constant
communication with each other?

Yeah, thank you.

Leonard?

-Still here.
-Okay.

-Leonard?
-Still here.

Okay.

Leonard?

Leonard?

Oh, God!

Too much dust.

Hey, ready for lunch?

Hang on.

Really, video games?

Is this some sort of
Freaky Friday thing

where you're actually Howard?

Please, if I were Howard,
I'd be doing this.

You know what? He's not wrong.

All right, great, can we go?

In a minute. I want to show
Howard I can play this game.

You know, you make
a lot more money than he does.

Can't you just rub
his nose in that?

I can, but I want
to rub his nose in this.

Ugh, damn it,
why can't I hit anybody?

Here, let me try.

Lots of luck...
it's way harder than it looks.

Got him.

Okay, this citation
is correct. How you doing?

Pretty good. I'm just
looking through

'The Effect of High Energy
Muons on Proton Pion Scattering

at the National Accelerator...'

'...Laboratory.'

Hey, should we take a break?

No, this actually
makes it more exciting.

We have to get through all of
this before I run out of this.

It's like the movie Speed,

but instead of a bus,
it's your lungs.

And instead of Sandra
Bullock, it has sadness.

Why did you pull
this Russian paper?

Oh, it was cited
in this paper over here,

so I thought
we should check it out.

Mm, it's not translated.

Maybe we should talk to Howard;
his Russian's pretty good.

We don't need Howard.
I've got Google Translate.

Okay, here we go,

from Russian to English.

'Examinations of moose
chowder in lemon parachutes.'

Yeah, okay, now I know
why this app is free.

Oh, gosh, my Russian's
a little rusty.

If it helps, this word
may be 'moose.'

Okay.

This paper is called

'Examinations of a

Super-Asymmetric Model
of the Universe'

by Dr. Vasily
Gregora-Poli-Popivich.

W... wait, so Amy and Sheldon

weren't the first
to think of super-asymmetry?

No, doesn't look like it.
This is from 1978.

Okay, well,

they might need to
rename their theory

'The Cooper-Fowler
Gregora-Poli-Popivich Theory.'

Kind of rolls right off
your tongue, doesn't it?

Sheldon is not gonna be
happy about this.

Well, he's gonna be less
happy about this, uh...

'The super-asymmetric model

'is inherently flawed

and does not

bear the weight of
further examination.'

Hmm.

So this disproves their theory?

Sounds like it.

Oh, how are we gonna tell him?

That's easy.

Just go up to him
and say, 'Sheldon,

Raj has something to tell you.'

Why do I have to tell him?

You did find it.

I fou... but he's the one
who translated it.

Okay, okay, h... how about this?

We all tell him.

Or even better: you tell him.

Yeah, that makes the most sense.

You guys are such cowards.

Yes, we are.

Hey, Denise. Is Stuart here?

Oh, no. Doctor's appointment.

Oh, is he okay?

Not since I've known him.

Which brings up
an interesting question.

You and Stuart.

Why?

I don't know. My parents
owned a funeral home.

Read into that what you will.

What can I help you with?

I was hoping Stuart could show
me how to play Fortnite.

-Mm, I can teach you.
-Really, you good?

Look at my skin. I haven't
been outside in six years.

So you'll coach me?

Sure.

Now let me ask you a question.

Howard.

Why?

You got eyes...
what do you think?

Wow, I really wish
I didn't see this.

Oh, hey.

I just need to give Sheldon
some bad news,

and I really don't want to.

Oh, my God. Is everything okay?

No, I... I found a paper
that proves their theory wrong.

They thought this was gonna
be their Nobel Prize.

It's gonna break his heart.

Oh, man. Maybe leave
an anonymous note,

you know, like in high school,

when you want to let
your best friend know

that her boyfriend's
cheating on her.

Why wouldn't
you just tell her that?

I don't know.
Maybe you had a Hickey.

I... isn't it better to
get bad news from a friend?

Trust me, it's not.

I went to prom with a
Hickey and a black eye.

Come on, knock on the door.
You can do this.

All right, a... all right,
here I go.

Oh, wait, just
let me get inside.

Why?

'Why'? Come on.

Oh, hey, Leonard.
Is the podcast too loud?

I didn't hear a podcast.

I told you no one could hear it.

Well, I heard Ira Glass,
so he's either in your ear buds

or clinging to the ceiling
like a gecko.

Actually, I... I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.

Oh, right, how are
the citations coming?

Well, Raj and I were
chasing them down

like you asked us to, and, um,

we came a... across a,

a Russian paper that seems
to disprove super-asymmetry.

Are you sure?

Yeah, uh,

Howard translated it.

I'm so sorry.

Sheldon, are you,
are you all right?

Oh, yes, of course.

Thank you for
telling us, Leonard.

I'm sure that wasn't easy.

I guess we don't
need this anymore.

So what are you listening
to, This American Life?

Okay, so walk up to
that chest and push X.

X.

Push X.

Which one's X?

The one with the X on it.

Take it easy, I'm new at this.

What, the alphabet?

You don't have to be snarky.

Hey, do you want
to play the game,

or do you want to crawl back up

your mommy's shirt
and chow down like a baby?

Damn, what is wrong with you?

I'm sorry, I thought you
wanted to beat your husband.

-I do.
-Well, then suck it up!

Okay!

Hi.

Can I do anything?

No.

I can make you some tea,
I... I could sing 'Soft Kitty.'

I don't understand how
you're not more upset by this.

This is your paper, too.

I am upset, Sheldon.

I'm just trying to hold
it together for you.

Like when that goose wouldn't
leave us alone at brunch.

That thing scared you, too?

Well, of course it did.
I was wearing a down jacket.

Well, I don't need you
to pretend to be okay for me.

If anything,
that makes it worse.

Fine.

I'm not okay.

We came up with this
idea at our wedding.

We poured months
of our lives into it.

I thought we were changing
the course of science,

and now it's all gone.
I'm devastated.

I was wrong,
that makes it worse.

Go back to being happy.

Hey, guys.

-Hey.
-Hey.

You, uh, playing that,
what's it called again?

Fortnow?

Fortnite.

Right. I guess I forgot
'cause I only played

it that one time and
I was so bad at it.

Don't beat yourself up.
It's a hard game.

Would you mind if I
gave it another shot?

-Mm, maybe later, Bernie...
-Give me.

Where are you, Howard,
where are you?

Let me just build a little
ramp, get some height.

You want to press B
to go into build...

oh, you already did it.

Did I? I'm just hitting buttons.

Wee!

I see your ramp.
I'm coming for you.

You can try, but...

Gotcha.

Son of a bitch.

-Want to play again?
-No!

-Howard.
-What?

I make more money than you.

You got yourself a
good one there, buddy.

So neither of them
showed up for work today?

No, I tried calling
and no one picked up.

Look, I'm sure they're fine.

They were probably up all night
coming up with a new theory.

I... I also texted to see
if he wanted to go to the new

Fantastic Beasts movie
and he didn't respond.

All right, well,
they're already dead.

There's nothing we can do.

Come in.

Hey...

You guys look all comfy.

Did... did you take the day off?

It's Saturday.

No, it's not.

Great, another thing
we're wrong about.

How many does that make, Amy?

Two.

Two things.

What happened to us?

I'll tell you what happened.

Professor Gregoropovich.

I... I think it's
Gregora-Poli-Popivich, but...

Three.

Look, you guys,

you had a, you had
a setback, you know?

This is the time you got to
dig in and... and try harder.

It's like half-time and
you're down by seven.

What are you doing?

All right, it's... it's like

Bat-half-time and you're
down by Bat-seven.

Let me try.

You... you guys can't just give up.

Uh, individually, you are
the smartest people I know.

Together, you can do anything.

I appreciate what you're
trying to do but please stop.

You can't make this better.

-All right, Amy, listen...
-I'm with Sheldon.

We worked our butts off
on this paper

and it was all for nothing.

And if you think
some pep talk can fix that,

then you don't understand
how much this meant to us.

Is there anything we can do?

No.

Yeah... wait.

Do I smell Siam Palace?

Oh, yeah, it's our dinner.

I mean, it's your dinner.

Any mango sticky rice?

No.

And the blows keep coming.

I see you. I see you...

and boom.

Gotcha!

How's it feel, Penny?

Like I don't care at all.

Wrong, it feels bad
because you lost and I won.

Whoo! What a rush!

All right, can we go eat now?

Hell yeah. All right.

Hey, how's it going?

Boom!

Okay, I'm... I'm gonna drive.

Actually, I... I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.

Oh, right, how are
the citations coming?

Um...

We came a... across a...

a Russian paper that seems
to disprove super-asymmetry.

Okay, Sheldon and Amy
are still pretty upset

about their theory
being disproved.

So we have made a list

of subjects for
everyone to avoid.

-Symmetry.
-Asymmetry.

Uh, SimCity... sounds
too much like symmetry.

That also applies
to The Simpsons,

Simba from The Lion
King, and cymbals.

Russia or Russian
in any context.

The country, the dressing,
the roulette.

Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV.

Why Rocky IV?

Because he fights a Russian.
I'm sorry about her.

We should just try
and avoid anything

that makes them think of
their project or science

or Nobel Prizes
or successes or failures.

-Hi!
-Hi!

-Hey, guys.
-Hey-a!

What are you guys doing?

Nothing.

Nothing?

Like what my career
has come to? Thanks a lot.

Nice going.

What are you doing?

Eating, reading, watching
television, listening to the radio.

What does it look
like I'm doing?

Is that asparagus? I
thought you hate asparagus.

I thought so, too, but I also
thought super-asymmetry

was a good idea, so what
else am I wrong about?

Oh, so now you're re-evaluating

every opinion you've ever had?

Yes. I am following the example

of 17th century
philosopher Rene Descartes.

He subjected all his beliefs

to radical doubt so that he
could build a bedrock belief

and build his cognitive life
back up on firm principles.

Ugh! Still yucky, still yucky.

Sheldon, I know you're
upset about the paper, okay.

I'm upset, too.

I mean, I was so sure
we were right.

Every fibre of my being
felt like this was it.

This was the one.

How can I trust my
instincts anymore?

Well, just because
our theory was wrong,

that doesn't mean you're
wrong about everything.

Doesn't it?

I've always thought I hated
jazz, maybe I was wrong.

Maybe it's great to hear
all the notes at once.

I'm trying, I'm really trying!

What you eating?

Chicken fried steak.

What?

You can't have chicken fried
steak first thing in the morning.

Hey, you knew I was a bad
boy when you married me.

Come on, you want
a piece of this?

You or the steak?

Me. I'm not sharing the steak.

Hey, you guys busy?

No, what's going on?

I'm really worried
about Sheldon.

I've never seen him this down.

Have you tried making
him a cup of tea?

He's re-evaluated tea.

Now he thinks it's
nothing but leaf soup.

That's a good point.

-No, it's not.
-No, it's not.

He's rethinking everything.

How long is it gonna be
before he gets to me?

Oh.

It's that bad, huh?

I'm afraid so. I just...
I don't know what to do.

I have something
that might help.

It's... it's a recording
of the only person whose...

opinion Sheldon
actually respects.

Hawking?

Feynman?

No, himself.

It's a pep talk he made
when he was a kid.

He gave it to me
years ago and told me

to save it for a real emergency.

What? You didn't break
it out when he declared

his room a sovereign nation

and waged a trade
war against us?

His major export is talking.
I didn't want that anyway.

Is that a VCR?

Yeah.

Amy asked if we had one
she could borrow and

I just want to make
sure it still works.

What's on the tape?

Not sure.

I used to record a lot of Jeopardy!
for my mom,

but if I push play
and you see some naked people...

Got it. What is porn?

Ooh, we were looking
for 'vintage '80s erotica,'

but I'll accept it.

Hello, everybody.

I am The Great Howdini.

Put it back on.
You look adorable.

It's just a practice tape
from when I was trying

to become a member
of the Magic Castle.

I didn't know
you auditioned there.

Oh, I never went
through with it.

I watched the tape and
realized I wasn't good enough.

You know that trick where

you saw a mannequin in half?

Don't you mean a lady?

Thank God it was not a lady.

I'd just be getting out of jail.

Come on, you're a good magician.

Really? You always
called magic dumb.

You can be good
at something dumb.

You know what, you
should audition now.

It's fine. I don't
need to be a member

of the most elite magical
society on the face of the earth.

Sounds like you still want it.

And I don't want our
kids to watch this tape

one day and think
their dad is a quitter.

Oh, we don't have to
show it to them.

Oh, I'm definitely
showing it to them.

Hey.

Hello.

'Fine with flags'?

Yes, flags...

up there flapping
around on poles.

If you think about it,

they're just the strippers
of the emblem world.

Well, I got something

that I think might cheer you up.

It is the emergency pep talk

you made when you were a kid.

Oh, that.

I was saving it for the day

they stop making
Star Wars movies.

I don't think that's
ever gonna happen.

How long has it been
since you've seen it?

Not since the day I recorded it.

No, I had just watched
Back to the Future II,

where Marty McFly gets a
glimpse of his future self

and that got me thinking,

the day may come where
I needed my help,

like they did with that movie.
That was not great.

Okay, all hooked up.

Here we go.

Oh, look how cute you were.

Amy please, of
course I was cute.

Look how I turned out.

Hello, Sheldon.

Hello, Sheldon.

If you're watching this,

I assume something
bad has happened.

Something unfortunate
and unforeseen.

Something that's making you
question everything.

I'm so smart.

Now just to make
sure it's really you

watching this and
not an imposter,

what am I thinking of?

On the count of three.

One, two, three.

-Robot monkey butler.
-Robot monkey butler.

Okay, good.

Should I leave you two alone?

No, this is gonna be inspiring.
You should watch.

Sheldon,

never forget,

no matter how bad things seem,

you can al...

What?

What... no. N...

My dad taped over
it with one of his

stupid high school
football games.

Sorry.

You know, it doesn't matter,
nothing matters.

Is there anything I can do?

Yes. You can build me
a time machine

so I can go back and tell
my younger self to give up,

because nothing's gonna
work out the way he wants.

I was thinking a nice cup
of leaf soup.

What's all this?

Your magic tricks
from the garage.

Your wands,

your top hat with the
stuffed mouse inside.

I never had a stuffed mouse.

Okay, do not wear this hat.

Why is it all
in the living room?

Because I think
The Great Howdini

deserves to be a member
of the Magic Castle.

That's sweet.

But I'm not that guy anymore.
I've outgrown it.

Have you?

Look, I know you still want
this, and I can help you.

All those pageants
I did as a kid...

I could teach you
how to present yourself,

connect with the judges,
sabotage the competition.

Whoa, whoa, no one's
sabotaging anybody.

Of course not.

Little girls in ball gowns
trip, it happens.

Trust me,

I'm gonna be the
pageant mom to you

that my mom was to me.

I thought you hated your
mom for making you do that.

More talk like that and
you're not getting any dinner.

Amazing how it all comes back.

Yes?

Hello, Mother.

Hey, Beverly.

Hello, Leonard.
Hello, Penny.

To what do I owe this call?

I need your professional advice.

Well, I'd love
to help you out, dear,

but I'm very busy at the moment.

Perhaps we can schedule
a time next week.

It's about Sheldon.

Oh, well, I...

I suppose I can spare
a minute or two.

Wh... why did you just say
you're too busy, but...

Leonard, please, not
everything is about you.

Penny, go on.

Well, ever since his
paper got disproven,

he's been a wreck.

He's been sad
and... and angry.

He just seems kind of broken.

Well, it sounds
like he may be grieving.

Really? Over a theory?

Of course. You can grieve
over any emotional loss.

The more you care
about something,

the greater the
trauma of losing it.

Oh, boy. He cared
about this a lot.

Yeah. What can we do
to help him?

Well, grieving is a process.

Every culture has its own
rituals and traditions

to facilitate mourning.

The ancient Egyptians
had their mummification,

the Tibetans had
their sky funerals...

And when I was little
and my dog died,

my mom sat me down and
very gently told me

that she wished the truck
had hit my dad instead.

I was trying
to lighten the mood.

Your dog had just died.

Howard and I have been
working really hard

on his audition,
so it'll be helpful

to get another
set of eyes on it.

Well, as someone who has watched

every episode of
America's Got Talent,

I'm getting pretty good
at telling

when some American's got talent.

Seriously, Heidi and I
agree, like, 90% of the time.

All right.

Don't be afraid to be
brutally honest.

Like my mom used to say
when I was doing pageants,

'Tears only make your eyes
sparkle brighter.'

That is both sad and true.

Half my Instagram
is after a good cry.

Howie, you ready?

Yeah.

I now present The Great Howdini.

# I've got magic to do,
just for you #

# I've got miracle plays
to play #

# I've got parts to perform,
hearts to warm #

# Kings and things
to take by storm #

# As we go along our

# Way.

Hello.

I'm The Great Howdini
from Altadena, California.

I have no brothers or sisters

and my favourite thing
to eat is grilled cheese.

When does the magic start?

It already started.

Hey.

Hi. How are
you guys doing?

A little better,
if you can believe it.

Sheldon?

Go away.

Buddy, come on, let us help you.

The only person who
could help me was erased

by the Medford High Wolves.

Oh, that's funny. My high
school was also the wolves.

No? Not now? Okay.

Look, t... this might
seem strange, but, uh,

we thought it might help
you get some closure

if you had a chance to properly
say good-bye to your paper.

Yeah, you know, we
could say a few words,

you could talk about
what it meant to you

and... and we could
bury it somewhere.

You mean have a
funeral for our theory?

Yeah.

That's ridiculous.

I thought so, too, but my
mom thought it might work.

Beverly thought it would help?
We should try it.

Wha... how come when you
thought it was my idea...

Leonard,
please, this is not about you.

I guess we could
bury it in the park.

Yeah, where dogs do their
business and other dogs

sniff that business?
I don't think so.

What would you
like to do, Sheldon?

The only fitting send-off:

a Viking funeral.

You mean, like,

push it out into a lake and
shoot it with a flaming arrow?

This guy gets it.

How about a bathtub and a match?

How about a bathtub
and a flaming arrow?

How about a bathtub, a match

and an ice-cold Yoo-hoo after?

Sold.

Would you like to say something?

Y... yes, thank you.

I know this is just
a scientific theory,

but to me, it was
more than that.

It described the universe
in a new and beautiful way.

I want that to be the
universe we live in,

but I guess it's not.

Amy, would you like
to shoot the arrow?

It's kind of
beautiful, isn't it?

Yeah, it is.

It's getting kind of
close to the curtain.

It's in water, it's fine.

-Oh!
-Oh!

Oh!

Oh!

Looks like we both had
theories that were wrong.

Okay...

Are you getting sick?

No, I have glitter in my nose.

Just your nose?

Consider yourself lucky.

Hey, I'm gonna
take tomorrow off

so we can spend the whole
day running the act.

You know what,

it has been so much fun

working on this with you, but...

But what?

It hasn't.

I'm not gonna audition.

Hey, I didn't raise a quitter.

You didn't raise me at all.

Look, I get that you're scared,

but we just have
to push past that.

I'm not scared.
I don't like the act.

It's over-the-top
and weird and...

has more jazz hands than magic.

Why didn't you say
something earlier?

You seemed like you
were so happy, and...

then when I tried
to say something,

you seemed like you were so mad.

Hey, this isn't about me.

I just wanted you
to have your dream,

and I wanted
to control everything

about how you looked and acted

so that your victory was mine.

Well, that's...

honest.

But if I'm gonna
go through with this,

I have to do it my own way.

I respect that,

and I'm glad that I helped
lead you to this moment.

Stop trying to make
this your victory!

Why are you watching that?

I'm just looking to
see if there's anything

left of your speech.

It's not important.
I remember everything I said.

And?

It was good,

it just would've meant
more coming from me.

All right, bring it in.

Is that your dad?

It is.

I've only seen pictures of him.

I know we're down,

by a lot.

And if I'm being
honest with you,

we're probably not
gonna win this one.

In fact, we're definitely
not gonna win this one.

Do you want me to turn it off?

But we're not
gonna quit, either.

And if we do lose,

you need to know that
doesn't make you losers.

You learn as much
about who you are

and what you're made of

from failing as you
do from success.

Maybe more.

So you can spend the next half

feeling sorry for yourselves,

or you can get out there
and give them hell.

Yeah! Let's give them hell!

Oh... watch your mouth,
your mom might...

I remember that game.

Did they win?

Oh, no.

No, they lost so bad,
the other team

let one of their cheerleaders
try to kick a field goal.

Well, that was a nice speech.
Too bad it didn't work.

Maybe it did.

What do you mean?

I've been acting like
the game is over, but...

it's only half-time.

And there's a lot more
physics left to play.

Wow, was that your first
ever sports metaphor?

It was.

And I think it was a home run.

That's two.

It's interesting.

I've always thought
that my father's journey

and my own were so
different, but...

he also faced
failure and setbacks.

Maybe our lives
mirrored each other

more than I thought.

So...

from one viewpoint,

you and your father's
lives are asymmetrical,

but from another vantage point,

they're symmetrical.

Sheldon,

what if symmetry and asymmetry

are observer-relative?

That would mean that
the Russian paper was right...

But only from one perspective.

If we look at it
from a deeper view

in more dimensions,
our theory still stands.

Not only stands, I...
it might be an even

bigger idea than the one we
were originally proposing.

Go get your laptop.
We have a paper to fix.

Okay.

Thanks, Dad.

We're gonna give them hell.

Hi!

I'm The Great Howdini,
and it's an honour

to be auditioning
at the Magic Castle.

Could I borrow your watch, sir?

-Sure.
-Thank you.

Ooh, Rolex, fancy.
I'll get it right back to you.

Observe: One very expensive watch,

one wooden mallet.

Do I dare?

I do.

Would you be amazed

if your watch survived
that pounding?

I think you would... behold.

Champagne, a champagne,

a champagne with a
packet of Splenda in it.

-You know what I call this drink?
-A waste of champagne?

No. A Dr. Cooper.

Because...

He's also sweet and bubbly.

All right.

A... a toast
to Sheldon and Amy

and the publication of
your super-asymmetry paper.

We are so proud of you guys.

-Cheers.
-Thanks.

Yay. Boom.

Ooh! That is PhD-licious.

So, have you guys gotten
any feedback yet?

Well, there are
some comments online,

but we haven't read them.

We decided we don't care what
people say about our work.

Good for you. People
online can be so mean.

I posted a picture of myself
on Instagram,

and some jerk said I looked
so skinny I might disappear.

And yet, somehow
she soldiers on.

Mm.

Although, Amy and I did
give the world a gift.

It would be nice to read
some of the thank-you notes.

I'm surprised you're interested
in some stranger's opinion.

Well, as I always say,
a stranger's just a friend

who hasn't complimented me yet.

Okay. I'll read them.

If any of them accuse
you of being too pretty,

Penny can help you through it.

Okay, here's one from
Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.

Wait, no, stop.

I don't want to know.
What if he's mean?

Well, what if
he's complimentary?

I want to know.

Okay. He says...

I don't want to know.

All right, just...
let me see it.

Okay, this is...
this is really positive.

Wow, it's, like, really positive.

He says it might be the
discovery of the decade.

He's right.
They love it!

This is so exciting.

Oh, this may be the
Dr. Cooper talking,

but pour me
another Dr. Cooper.

Hey, Penny and I
were thinking of getting

a big paint-ball game together.

Oh, Leonard, why does she want
to shoot you?

She doesn't want to shoot me.

-Who doesn't want to shoot you?
-Penny.

No, that doesn't sound right.

She just wants
to play paint-ball.

It combines my love of whimsy

with her love
of making grown men cry.

Sounds fun.
Bernadette and I are in.

You don't need to ask her?

No. I've been pretty
annoying lately.

She's gonna want to shoot me.

Dr. Cooper.

Ah, President Siebert.

What are you doing
in the regular cafeteria?

You're a superstar.

No offence, worker bees.

You should join me
in my private dining room.

Dr. Fowler is already there.

Can I bring my friends?

No.

-Can I bring my tater tots?
-Yes.

All right, let's go.

Welcome to the inner sanctum.

Oh, I do love a good sanctum.

Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.
It's got kiwi on it.

Ugh. I don't like kiwi.

Neither do I, but it's so fancy.

Well, this is nice.

Why have we waited
so long to do this?

Because you never invited us.

Ha-ha-ha!

Well, the important thing
is you're here now,

and we're so excited
about your work.

This paper's going to do
big things for all of us,

so if there's anything
that you need...

You know, actually, I could use

some barbecue sauce for my tots.

Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.

Can we have some barbecue sauce

and ketchup over here?

Both?

So this is how
the other half lives.

I just want you to know
that you have our full support,

and we're organizing
a big media push.

Articles. Interviews.

Oh, you want us
to do interviews?

Well, we're thinking a
divide-and-conquer approach here,

where you do the interviews,

and Sheldon stays here
and holds down the fort.

You know...

in case there's an emergency.

What kind of an emergency
would there be in physics?

I don't know, maybe there's
an object in motion

that won't stay in motion.

Or a reaction that's
equal but not opposite.

It sounds like you don't want
Sheldon to do the interviews.

It's not that we don't want
Sheldon to do the interviews,

it's just that we really
want you to do the interviews.

Without Sheldon.

Now, wait, wait, are you
trying to exclude me?

Look, Sheldon,
you're a brilliant man,

but your people skills are...

This is not barbecue sauce!

This is steak sauce!
What are you trying to pull?

Like that.

This is ridiculous.

It is my work, too,
and I am perfectly capable

of keeping it together
for an interview.

Okay. Say somebody asks
if you feel your work

is derivative of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski.

Seriously, can we get this
man some barbecue sauce!?

Would you mind stocking these?

Actually, I'm not
on the clock today.

I'm just hanging out
with my boyfriend.

Ah, cool. Huh.

That's me, right?

Oh, I forgot to tell you...
I broke up with you,

and now I'm
dating... that guy.

I know you're joking,

but my flight-or-flight
response doesn't.

Isn't it fight-or-flight?

Not for me.

So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

This is our wedding, and
if anyone's gonna design

the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.

Thank you.

I mean, I... I'm not trying
to be a groomzilla, but...

this is my speciality.

Someone texting you?

Uh, no. It's just my,
uh, doorbell camera.

Oh. I got one of those for my
place, but I never installed it.

Oh, it's easy.
I can do it for you.

You're gonna love it.
It's how I found out

a raccoon was stealing my
cheese-of-the-month club.

What did you do?

Nothing. I didn't
want to piss it off.

It was, like, huge from
eating all the cheese.

Hey. We're doing a big
paint-ball game on Saturday

if you two want to join.

Oh, my room mate asked me

to help her move
out on Saturday.

Ugh. That sucks.

Sucks for her.
I'm playing paint-ball.

I... I didn't know your
room mate was moving out.

Yeah. I've been looking
for a new one, but...

so far no luck.

You hear that?

She needs a room mate.

What do you think, Stuart?

Uh, I... i... it, uh...

Flight.

Flight.

-That was hard to watch.
-Yeah.

Okay,

I need you to be honest with me.

How do I look?

A little shorter, but as we age
that happens to all of us.

Come on, help me out here.

I've got a bunch
of interviews today.

Well, no one'll notice.
They never met you before.

Sheldon, I'm nervous,

and I wish you were
coming with me.

If it helps,

I wrote up some possible
questions and answers for you.

'Whom do you love more,'

'Sheldon the scientist
or Sheldon the man?'

Answer: 'Sheldon the scientist,

but by such a slim margin that
it's statistically insignificant.'

Well, you really managed
to capture my voice.

Well, don't worry. I'm
sure you're gonna do great.

Thank you.

Okay, bye.

Wait... wait... wait.
You forgot the cards.

Love you, too.

Really? She asked you
to move in with her?

Yeah, she was
hinting around about it,

but I think I handled
it pretty well.

'Pretty well'?

You ran out of there so fast,
if it was a cartoon,

there would have been a
Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.

Was she mad?

Uh, no. I talked to her after.
She said she's fine.

-Oh, no.
-Yikes!

You'll find someone new.

Everything okay?

Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

I helped her install it.

You can't look at it.
That's spying.

Who the hell is this guy?

Ooh, let me see.

He's got... bags.

He's probably
just delivering food.

Why is she hugging him?

Maybe she doesn't
have tip money?

W... wait, why is she
inviting him into the house?

She's a good tipper?

Do you ever feel guilty
that we get to eat

in the fancy dining
room while our friends

have to eat in the regular one?

Yes.

Wait, did you say
'guilty' or 'happy'?

'Guilty.'

Oh, then no.

In fact, take a picture of me

with the garlic
knots to send them.

There's my MVP...
Most Valuable Physicist.

Thank you.

And my star
of NPR Science Friday

and a potpourri
of popular podcasts.

I don't know if I'd
use the word 'star.'

I would. I got an early
look at the interview

you did for Wired,
and it is glowing.

They loved you.

That's great.
Thanks for telling me.

Congratulations, Amy.

-I'm so proud of you.
-And that headline...

'The Neurobiologist
Who Revolutionized Physics.'

I'm sorry. The who who
did what to... huh?

Oh, hey, how did
your interview go?

Okay, I guess.

You don't sound very happy.

Oh, why wouldn't she be happy?

She's the neurobiologist
who revolutionized physics.

Sorry.

This should be fun.
I've never played before.

Oh, fair warning... it can
get pretty ugly out there.

Okay, well, remember,
I'm your fiancee.

Oh, I remember. Do you?

All right,

we need two teams.
Who wants to be the captain?

Oh, me.

Uh, sure.
Why not?

All right, why don't
you pick first?

Okay, um... Leonard.

Yeah?

No, I'm picking you.

First? For... a team?

What is happening?

All right, I take Bernadette.

Really? You're
picking her over me?

Yeah, 'cause she's vicious

and can hide behind a mushroom.'

Um... Sheldon.

Raj.

Amy.

I'll take Anu.

Howard.

All rightie.

Come on, pick me, pick me.

I will take... Stuart!

Yes!

Okay, guys, we need some people

to stay here and guard the flag

and some people to move out
and try to capture theirs.

Okay. Sheldon, do you
want to stay here and...?

What? Hold down the fort?
'Cause that's all I' m good for.

Is that what you
were going to say?

You know that's
not what he meant.

Oh, why don't you go out there?

Maybe you'll be
the neurobiologist

who revolutionizes paint-ball.

Stop it. You're
being ridiculous.

Am I? Maybe it's just
my poor people skills.

Oh, it's definitely
your poor people skills.

All right, the choices are...
get shot at

or stay here and
listen to them fight.

Shot at.

This is pretty exciting,
sneaking around like this.

Oh, so you like sneaking around.
Good to know.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing. Never mind.

Let me see
if the coast is clear.

See anybody?

Yes, I saw a strange man

going into your house
the other night!

What?

But out there, there's nobody.

Ow!

I'm hit.

Ow!

I said I was hit!

Sorry.

Ow!

Why do you keep shooting me?

Why don't you want
to move in with me?

I... I didn't say I didn't want to.

No, you just ran away.

Stuart?

Stuart?

Did you run away again?

No!

Bang, you're out.

What?

I'm not out. You
didn't even shoot me.

I'm not gonna shoot you
from right here.

It's too close.
It's gonna hurt.

Oh, come on. It's not
gonna hurt that bad.

I'm telling you, from this
distance it's gonna...

Ow!

See? That hurt!

All right. Fine,
you can shoot me.

-No, I'm not gonna shoot you.
-Ow!

Ow! Ow!

Aah, you were right.
We're way too close.

See, I told you
it's gonna hurt...

Ow!

I can't believe
you're taking this out on me.

I was just trying to get
publicity for our paper.

By making it seem
like it was your idea?

I didn't write the
headline, Sheldon.

Did you even read the article?

Because I talk
about you continuously.

I know,

and it just made you
sound modest and charming.

Why can't you just
be proud of me?

I am proud of you.

Really? Because
you sound jealous.

Well, I'm that, too.
I've seen Inside Out.

I know I can feel
two things at once.

Ow!
Ow!

Well, now I feel three things.

Hey. Who shot you?

Oh. Uh, oh...

Denise, uh, Denise,
Denise, Denise, Denise,

Denise, Denise, Denise,

Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise

and me when I was
running from Denise.

What is up with you two?

Well, it's kind of
hard to explain. Uh,

you know when things
are going great, but you worry

that any minute you might
screw everything up?

-No.
-Yes.

If you really like her, you
can't let fear get in the way.

You have to move forward.

And at a certain point, the
fear of losing her goes away?

I will let you know.

You were spying on me?

That is not the point.
The point is who was that man?

Fine. That was
my ex-boyfriend.

Some of his stuff
was still at my house,

and he stopped by to pick it up.

And did you give it to him?
Did you give him his stuff?

If 'stuff' means sex, then no.

If 'stuff' means his
Waterpik, then yes!

I got the flag!

I'm gonna make a run for it.
Cover me!

So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

Because you're hiding
something from me?

No, because you should trust me!

How can I trust you?
I barely even know you!

Then what are we doing?

Why are we planning a wedding?

I don't know.

Aah,
sad man!

Ow!

Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.

I can't believe you shot me!

I can't believe I did, either.

Right in the chest.

Sorry. That's gonna
leave a bruise.

Yeah, a big one.

-Does it hurt?
-A little.

Want to kiss it
and make it better?

I do.

Where are you going?

Home.

Don't worry.

I'll wave to the doorbell
when I get there.

Wait, wait, wait.
At least let me drive you.

That's okay. I'll Uber.

We can take you.

-Come on, Sheldon.
-Okay.

But I should warn you,
we're in a bit of a spat.

At least I think we are.
Amy, are we still in a spat?

Are you ready to apologize?

We are.

-Aha!
-Hey!

Get out!

Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't see anything.

Actually, could I...?

Ooh, thank you!

Hey.

Wow. That's a lot of bruises.

Yeah, well, you shot
me a lot of times.

That's not even counting
the bruises on the inside.

'Cause I hurt your feelings?

Let's hope that's all it is.

Ah, look, I'm sorry
that I freaked out.

It's just that things are
going so good with us,

and I'm afraid that
if we go too fast,

I am gonna mess it up.

I get that.

I don't want to mess
things up, either.

Um, I got you something.

It's a key to my place
to show you that I'm serious.

Thank you.

Well, isn't this technically

a key to Howard
and Bernadette's place?

Yes, so don't ever use it or
let them know that you have it.

-Come here.
-Oh. Uh, no.

I appreciate it, but
seriously, this is all bruise.

Kiss?

Gently.

Ow.

I'm about to start recording.
Are you guys ready?

Sheldon, are you ready?

-Absolutely.
-Great.

So, Dr. Cooper, my first
question is for you.

Oh, goody.

Would you say that your paper
is an extension

of the work of Professor
Joseph Polchinski?

I'll be in the car.

So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

This is our wedding,
and if anyone's gonna

design the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.

Thank you.

I mean, I... I'm not trying
to be a Groomzilla, but...

this is my special day.

Everything okay?

Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

I helped her install it.

You can't look at it.
That's spying.

Who the hell is this guy?

Ooh, let me see.

So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

Because you're hiding
something from me?

No, because you should trust me!

How can I trust you?
I barely even know you!

Then what are we doing?

I don't know.

-Oh!
-Aah,

sad man!

This is so great.

Why don't we do it more often?

Because you have two kids,

I have Sheldon, and...

Penny's apparently in
the gym all the time,

'cause damn, look at her!

Yeah, so impressive
how you manage

to bounce back
after having no babies.

Ah, another reason why
we don't do this more often.

You've come
to a giant metal door.

I check the door for traps.

There are no traps.

I use my wizard eye

to see what's on the
other side of the door.

Hey, that's sort of
like how you used

a doorbell camera to
spy on your fiancee.

No, it's nothing like that.

Your wizard eye
reveals a monster.

-Oh. Is it alone and unloved?
-I guess.

I open the door and say,
'Hey, Raj.'

I have a bottle
of champagne for you.

Oh, we didn't order this.

It's from the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

Oh.

Well, if we drink
it, does that mean

we're making a promise?

'Cause I am happily married,
although I will watch.

We're not gonna do anything.

Really?

So all that work's for Leonard?

Why don't you just call her?

I'm sure
you guys can work this out.

I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just play.

Okay, the Cyclops tells you

that the enchantress you seek,

is staying at the Inn
of the Dwarven Lords.

Really? An inn?

Anu is a concierge at a hotel.

That's a little insensitive,
don't you think?

I hadn't noticed that
before you mentioned it.

Well, now that I've mentioned
it, how do you feel?

Bad.

Shame on you.

-Hey, ladies.
-Zack!

Hi. You guys
know Zack.

-Of course.
-Yeah.

Did... did you send this over?

I did.

I asked for the most
expensive one they have.

They said it was $200,

and I said I want a
more expensive one.

And then, they said it was $300.

But it... it was the same...

Don't.

Thank you, but you shouldn't
have spent so much.

Nah. It's cool.

I sold my company for
a boatload of money.

And then I bought a boat.

Then I got married.

Guess where.

On your boat?

No, but that would've
been awesome!

Well, congratulations.

Hey, you and Leonard

should come over and have
dinner with us on our boat.

Yeah, that would be so nice.

Leonard was just saying
how he was hoping to have dinner

with one of your ex-boyfriends
on his expensive boat.

Well, then this
worked out perfect!

Oh, yeah.

Hey. How was game night?

Oh, off the charts.

Literally. Sheldon
rolled a number so high,

it wasn't on any
of these charts.

That's funny.

Wow. I should not
have driven home.

How was ladies' night?

It was fun.

Amy got drunk
and kept telling us

that Sheldon's chest is
smooth like a porpoise.

Well, it does squeak
when you touch it.

And we ran into Zack.

Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?

He got married.

Oh. Well, that's nice.

Yeah, and he sold his company
for a fortune and retired.

Huh.

And you ended up with me,
so everybody wins.

Wait. You're not
jealous of Zack, are you?

What? Oh, absolutely not.

In fact, he should be jealous
of me because I have you.

And a dungeon with over
30 rooms left unexplored

because no one thought to
search for secret doors

under the wizard's throne.

Oh. You know, I'd
like to go exploring.

-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

Well, I'll get
the dice back out.

Go away, Raj!

What are you doing?

I'm winning you back
Love Actually style.

I don't know what that means.

Really?

You've never seen Love Actually?

If you want to watch it
right now, I'll just wait.

I have nothing to say to you.

Look, we both made mistakes.

I am so sorry that
I spied on you.

I didn't mean to, but
I know it was not okay.

Now, do you want
to apologize to me?

You also said you don't trust me

and that you barely know me.

I really thought this would be

more of a back-and-forth thing.

Honestly, Raj, why do you
even want to marry me?

You know, family
and India and stuff.

Here's what I think.

All of your friends are married,

and you don't want
to be left behind.

And honestly, that's not
a good enough reason.

Uh, okay, well, how
is that different

than what you're doing? Hmm?

Worried that you
wasted so many years

dating the wrong
people, and now,

you're just looking
for a shortcut.

You're right.

It's not different.

Okay, so we agree.

-Yeah.
-Great.

Wait. What did we
just agree on?

That we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

You know what? Why
don't you shut the door,

and I'll just do the cards?

Uh, do you remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?

Leonard, I remember all
of Penny's ex-boyfriends.

If you'd like, I could
list them alphabetically.

No, thank you.

Fun fact.

You would think Zack would
be the last one on the list,

but she also dated two Zekes.

Well, apparently,
Zack sold his company

for a ton of money and retired.

And that bothers you?

I don't know. I mean...

I guess so. Yeah.

It doesn't seem fair.

I work hard.

I'm really smart.

I've made substantial
contributions to my field.

But Zack gets to be rich,

while I'm still
working for a pay check?

Well, a lot of people
you don't know are rich.

That doesn't seem to bother you.
Mark Zuckerberg,

Sultan of Brunei, Gordon Letwin.

Who's that?

He's one of the first 11
employees of Microsoft.

Yeah, well, I don't have to
hang out with Gordon Letwin.

Well, that's too bad.

He helped create
the HPFS file system.

Oh, the stories he could tell.

Penny told him
we'd go have dinner

with him and his wife
on their stupid boat.

Well, just tell her
you don't want to go.

Well, then, she'll think
I'm being jealous and petty.

So you want to seem
mature and confident.

I make one mistake,

and she says she doesn't
want to marry me.

Like she never screwed up.

Did she?

Well, she agreed to marry me.

Honestly, I think
you dodged a bullet.

I don't think
she was right for you.

Howie, shh.

What?

You can't bad-mouth Anu.

They're gonna get back together,

and you're gonna
look like a jerk.

I mean, remember
when we broke up,

and Penny said all those
mean things about you?

What did she say?

I don't want to get into it.

Some of it was hurtful,
most of it was true.

So I'm just supposed
to lie to my friend?

I don't want you to lie to me.

No one's gonna lie to you.

Lie.

She says the only
reason I'm marrying her

is because all my
friends are married,

and I don't want
to feel left out.

Oh, that's nonsense.

No.
She's right.

Now what do I say?

So, Marissa, how
did you guys meet?

Oh, it's a pretty funny story.

We met in a book store.

That is funny.

Yeah, I was just there
using the bathroom,

but this one had a stack
of books, like, this tall.

Oh. So, you really like to read?

Oh, no. I work there.

Yeah, she is super smart.

Seriously, you name,
like, any book,

she'll tell you if
she's heard of it.

Go on, try her.

Oh, uh, well, uh...

-Catcher in the Rye.
-Nope.

Look at that, Penny.

I guess we both like nerds.

So, uh,

we gonna take this thing out?

Nah. It's a little
choppy tonight.

Yeah, that's okay...

this is nice, sitting
under the stars.

It's actually kind of peaceful.

Well, it's a beautiful boat.

Thanks, man.

We love it.

Although, he's so tall
he bangs his head

almost every time
he goes downstairs.

After the first couple,

you don't even feel it.

Where are our manners?

Zack, let's get our guests
something to drink.

Oh, you got it, babe.

I can't believe that guy's rich.

Ooh, watch your head.

That was a close one.

Are you jealous?

I know, I know, I shouldn't be.

He's super sweet.
I should be happy for them.

Oh, it's driving me crazy, too.

Really?

Yes. I was trying to
pretend like it wasn't

so you wouldn't
think I was petty.

Wha... turns out
we're both petty.

I love you so much.

Aw.

Cheers, guys.

-Aw, thanks.
-Thank you.

So listen, I got to be honest.

We sort of have another
reason for asking you here.

We want to have a baby,

but we can't do it on our own.

It could be because of the game

me and my frat
brothers used to play

where we kicked each other
in the balls over and over.

But the doc says
there's no telling.

We just don't know.

Huh.

You went to college.

And Zack's always
admired you, because...

you're the smartest
person he knows.

Okay, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

You know, this has been
such a nice evening.

Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?

Aw, you said a thing.

Wow, this is really flattering.

And also really weird, right?

Oh, just to be clear,

you don't get to...

you know.

No, I...

I got it.

Just because I
slept with your wife

doesn't mean you get
to sleep with mine.

We... we get it, but...

thank you for
saying it out loud.

You're welcome.

I know it's a big ask,

but it would mean so much to us.

Yeah, and we really
don't want a stranger's,

-you know...
-I know... sperm.

And Zack's always talked about

what a great guy Leonard is.

I...

I really don't know what to say.

Really? You don't know
what to say?

You know, I... I think we
should talk about this.

Oh, yeah.

Definitely, you guys
should talk, yeah.

Take your time.

He means privately.

-Right. Sorry.
-Sure. Yep.

-Come on, Zack.
-Okay. Yeah.

Okay.

You really think those
two should be parents?

There's nothing wrong with them.

Ow!

Hello, Daddy.

Did you install a camera
to spy on your fiancee?

What?

No!

That's what her parents told me

when they said they
were calling off the wedding.

But I told them you would
never do such a thing.

Thank you.

I mean, I did install a camera

and I did spy on her,

but I did not install
it to spy on her.

Well, that's not going
to be our story.

Our story is that she's a liar.

And... and old.
An old, dirty liar.

Oh, no.
She's... she's actually great.

I'm the one who screwed up.

Well, don't say that to them.

She's bad. You're good.

They have to pay me back
for my wedding deposits.

This is all my fault.
I should have...

I should have just trusted her.

So you're saying you
still want to get married?

Fine. Then I'll call her parents

and we'll straighten
this whole thing out.

I don't think she
wants to marry me.

And honestly...

she deserves someone better.

Rajesh, you need to stop
being so hard on yourself.

You're a good man.

Wow.

Y... you've never told me that.

You're also a dope.

That you've said.

But your heart's
in the right place,

and you deserve happiness.

So you just need to
figure out what you want,

and if that means
cancelling the wedding,

we cancel the wedding.

Thank you.

But figure it out quickly,
or I'll be celebrating

my next birthday
with a lot more elephants

and marigolds than I expected.

And Leonard just stood
there with a big,

dumb smile on his face,
like he was watching

a puppy and a
monkey make friends.

Well, I can see how he'd
be flattered to be asked.

It's not flattering.
It's creepy.

Well, something can be
both flattering and creepy.

You know, just the other night,

Sheldon said that my feet

looked like Richard
Feynman's hands.

Really? So you'd be
okay if someone wanted

to use Sheldon as
their sperm donor?

Oh, absolutely not. I am
the only handmaid in this tale.

So Leonard's really
considering this?

Yes. We got in a
huge fight about it.

He said, well, if I
don't want to have his baby,

then why shouldn't
someone else be able to?

Do you believe that?

What?

Well,

there is a deep-seated
biological drive

to pass on your genes.

It's only natural.

So you're on his side?

Well, viewing
Leonard as a mammal,

it's perfectly understandable.

But viewing him as your
husband, he stinks.

And we hate him.

Really?

Zack wanted you to donate

your genetic material
for his baby?

Yeah.

So I'd be helping out a couple

who really want a baby,
and they were gonna pay us,

and Penny freaked out about it.

-That doesn't make any sense.
-I know.

They wanted you?

Yes, Sheldon, they wanted me.

-I'm smart. I'm nice.
-I'm smart. I'm nice.

And I can eat cheese
without clearing out a room.

Are you upset he didn't ask you?

Of course not. I just
think it's interesting

that of all the people he knows,

he thinks you're
the best choice.

Well, he does.

I don't see why Penny
is so against this.

Well, perhaps Penny's worried

that you haven't considered
the emotional toll

of knowing there's
a child out there

who is biologically yours
but not actually yours.

Wow, that's really insightful.

Yeah, I'm taller than you
and I don't have asthma.

Those people are crazy.

Come on, I know you're there,

and I know you know it's me.

-You're just making this harder.
-Look...

you were right.

I was doing this for
the wrong reasons.

You deserve to marry
someone who knows

how amazing you are...

and who proposes because...

he doesn't want to spend
a single day without you.

Not...

not because he wants to
catch up to his friends.

Thank you.

And I want you to know,

I think I could be that man.

Raj, I'm not gonna marry you.

I'm not asking you to.

Then why are you here?

Because I like you.

Okay? I like you.

I... I like you enough

to start this relationship
at the beginning,

not in the middle.

So...

will you go out
on a date with me?

I don't know.

Okay.

But I warn you,

I just got out of
a weird relationship,

and I might complain
about my ex a lot.

Maybe he's being weird because

he doesn't know how to
ask for his ring back.

Hey.

Hi.

Where you been?

Just out.

All right, look, um...

I'm sorry that we fought before.

I know this is a really

unusual situation, and if you

don't want me to do it, I won't.

Really?

Yeah.

We're a team.
We're in this together.

I'll be right back.

What is that?

It's a sample cup.

Really?

'Cause it looks like the
top off the NyQuil bottle.

It's the closest thing
I could find.

-It's a gesture. Shut up.
-All right, sorry.

So...

are you saying you're
okay with this?

I don't know, but...

when I told you I didn't
want to have kids,

you didn't have a
say in that, so...

maybe I don't need
to have a say in this.

Thank you.

They couldn't have
picked a better person.

Are you calling Zack?

No, Sheldon.

Would you say that last
part one more time?

Oh, my...

Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

And this is:
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

and Dr. Amy Farrah
Fowler present...

Dr. Sheldon Cooper's
Fun with Flags.

I'd like to start this episode
by apologizing on behalf

of Dr. Fowler, who made
the wild claim last week

that there was no national
tricoloured flag

with a purple stripe,
when, in fact,

the Estonian governorate
inside the Russian Empire

had a purple stripe on their
flag from 1721 to 1917.

See?

Right there in the middle.

And I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Dr. Cooper

for having his zipper down
for the entire segment

on the flags of East Africa.

Sorry, Tanzania,
you deserve better.

All right,

on today's episode,
we're gonna start

with some viewer e-mails.

Oh, take off your glasses
so people can't see

your password in the reflection.

Oh, s... sure.

Okay, our first e-mail
is... mm... from...

uh, Brad or Brian?

-I don't know, maybe it's Seth.
-All right, put them back on.

Oh. Uh...

oh, my gosh, it's from
Fermilab in Chicago.

Ah. Not surprising,
the Windy City.

Great flag town.

No, no, it's about our paper.

A team of physicists...

confirmed super-asymmetry.
Our paper was...

right. We did it.

We did it?

We did it.

We did it.

We did it!

We did it!

We did it!

Aw, remember when they only
did it on her birthday?

So, my incredible wife
has some exciting news.

Howie, stop.
I don't want to brag.

Oh, okay, sorry.

Really? No one's gonna ask?

Sorry. What's your news?

The drug I've been working on
for the past five years

just got approved by the FDA.

-Wow.
-Oh, congratulations.

Was that the decongestant
you developed?

No, we had to re-brand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.

Is it that anti-itch cream you
were testing on grad students?

It's not, but that's
a really funny story

which I'm legally
prevented from telling you.

It's her anti-inflammatory drug.

Oh.

Yep, three years of testing
and no reported side effects.

Ah, so it works.

Eh.

Well, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,

because I want you
to head up my sales team.

Really? Me?

Don't you want someone
with more experience?

Nope. The job's all yours.

Okay, well, thank you.

Why don't we just chat
about this at work?

We can chat about it all you
want, but you're doing it.

We'll see.

That's a yes.

You guys will never believe
what just happened.

Yeah, we heard.
You did it.

We did do it.

And we didn't even
know we did it!

Wait, what?

Two physicists in
Chicago had to tell us.

Wait, what?

Their experiment on kaon decay

supported our predictions on
the higher order corrections

pertaining to super-asymmetry.

Wait, what?

I am so proud of you.

Well, I know how
to do the dishes.

Just, sometimes I'm tired.

No, I... I mean,

I'm proud of how well
you're doing at work.

Are you even using soap?

-Do you want to do this?
-Yeah, I really do.

You know, it was nice
of Bernadette to offer,

but I'm not sure it's
the right move for me.

Well, what are you
talking about?

If you were in charge
of her project,

wouldn't that be a promotion?

Well, yeah, but it's not
the most important thing.

Aren't you always saying
it's about the work,

not more money
or a better title?

All the smart things I say,

and you remember the dumb one.

Plus, I'd be working
for Bernadette.

I don't know
if that's a good idea.

Look, I... I know she
can be difficult,

but she's no match for you.

Whatever she dishes out,

you can give it
right back double.

What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

There you go.

President Siebert,

I have Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler for you.

Great.

You two.

Bring it in.

What are we bringing in?

A hug.

Oh. No, I don't want to.

Well, what you don't want,

you don't get.

Come on. Sit.

I hope you know,
with these new data

supporting your theory,
we could be looking

at a Nobel-winning achievement.

And by 'we, '

you mean 'we, '

not 'we.'

'We,' 'we, whatever.

Whee!

Just a heads-up.

Doctors Pemberton and
Campbell from Fermilab

are flying to Los Angeles, and
they are eager to meet you.

Confirming my theory,
eager to meet me.

They are checking all my boxes.

You know, Caltech has
38 Nobel laureates.

If you win, you and Amy
will be 39 and 40.

Ooh! Dibs on 39.

What's the difference?

Wha... you are right,
there is no difference at all.

Thank you. It is exciting.

Oh, that's very sweet.

I'm gonna remember
you said that.

Just like I remember how
you tried to take my office

when I was on maternity leave.

Of course I'm not angry.

Bye-bye.

How can I be angry
at a dead man?

Hey, you got a sec?

Sure. What's up?

Uh, bad news.

I spoke to my supervisor

about heading up your
sales team, and she said

she just can't
lose me right now.

Do you want me to call her?
I could rip her a new one.

No, no. No ripping.

Um, anyway, I... I don't want
to leave her short-handed,

so I'm sorry.

I respect that.

That's what makes you
a good employee.

Oh, thank you.

It's just such a bummer.

I know. Just, ugh!

You sure you don't
want me to call her?

Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely sure.
Don't call her.

But, you know, just, ugh, why?

The last time we were in this
room, we were getting married.

I remember.

It's a lot less impressive
without Mark Hamill in it.

That's what you said
about our honeymoon.

And I stand by it.

Doctors Cooper and Fowler,

these are Doctors
Pemberton and Campbell,

whose experiment
confirmed your work.

-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you. Hi.

Okay, I'll leave you all to it.

Remember about the hugging.

It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

Oh, it's really nice
to meet you, too.

I mean, we thought we'd
have to wait decades

to get confirmation
for our theory.

Yes, thanks to you,
I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner

with my original teeth.

Well, this certainly is a thrill
for us. Lunch with you two,

and, uh, tomorrow, we're
gonna see a taping of Ellen.

She's having John Stamos on.

Uncle Jesse!

Sounds fun.

So, um, listen, we just
published a few months ago.

How did you have time to
design an experiment?

We didn't.

This whole thing is actually
a gigantic accident.

Yeah, we've been
working with kaons,

and our data made
absolutely no sense.

A few weeks ago, someone
told us about your paper,

and we realized
that our failed experiment

confirmed your theory.

And now, instead
of losing our jobs,

Fermilab flew us to L.A.
Economy Plus.

Free headphones.

Looks like my wife left
me a month too soon.

So you weren't even
thinking about super-asymmetry?

Thinking about it?

We don't even understand it.

And now look at the four of us,

changing the face of physics!

Ooh, I got to do it.

Oh, man, that last episode

of Star Trek:
Discovery was crazy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I... I'm actually one behind.

I haven't started
the new season yet.

Ooh, uh, how about
this week's Walking Dead?

-Two behind.
-Three behind.

Black Mirror?

-No.
-No.

Come on, there must be
something we've all seen.

Oh, how about that video
of my dog I sent you,

where she's growling
at a pine-cone?

I actually hadn't
watched it yet,

but thanks for
ruining the ending.

Uh, can you believe this?

Doctors Pemberton and
Campbell have been doing

a press tour trying to take
credit for super-asymmetry.

They didn't even know
what they were finding.

So what?

I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

for accidentally
discovering something.

Yeah, who remembers
the guy who was trying

to find India and
discovered America instead?

What was his name again?

But this is different.

Sheldon, super-asymmetry
is your paper.

Everyone knows
you were there first.

Mm, actually, the Nobel
Committee has sometimes favoured

experimentalists like them
over theoreticians like you.

No, that's just
a scary camp-fire story

like the guy with the hook.

No, I... it's true.

The scientists that
proved the big bang,

they thought their
sensors needed cleaning

until someone pointed out
that they were picking up

cosmic background radiation
from the singularity.

They won the Nobel.

Not the scientists that
came up with the theory.

So you're saying they could
steal our Nobel Prize?

Yes.

That's terrible.

Good news, though:

Now we have something
we can talk about.

Hey, you wanted to see me?

-Yeah, come on in.
-Okay.

Close the door.

Okay.

Have a seat.

Do I have to?

You really do.

So, I talked to your
supervisor, and she said

that she never stopped you
from working on my team,

because you never asked her.

Really?

Oh, you know, you should know,

she's been taking
our new antidepressant,

and lying is one of
the main side effects.

Why don't you want
to work with me?

I know I can be tough,
but that's just 'cause

I'm surrounded by
useless idiots.

No, it's not that.

Then why?

Honestly, I don't
know if I'm up to it.

You know, the last
project I managed

was my high school yearbook.

And?

And that was the year
we didn't have one.

Apparently, the printers
won't make them

without getting paid.

What happened to the money?

Uh, if I didn't know then,

I'm not gonna
magically know now.

Plus, you know,
I didn't go to college.

I'd be in charge of people
that are far more educated

with more experience;
what if they don't listen to me?

Then you be really mean to them.

Have I taught you nothing?

Penny, everybody
feels like you do.

Like they're not good enough,

not smart enough.

What, even you?

Of course.

Dr. Rostenkowski,
you wanted me...

Hey, did they not teach
knocking at Stanford? Get out!

I love that kid.

There you are.

Dr. Cooper, hello.

Hello to you, too.

Now stop trying to
steal our Nobel Prize.

You come up with your own idea.

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

Wouldn't that be
something, though?

Well, too bad.

This discovery belongs
to Amy and me.

Look, Dr. Cooper,
we all want a Nobel Prize.

Super-asymmetry could be the

breakthrough that gets us there.

But we can't fight over credit;
we have to work together.

So...

you're saying that
the four of us

should just agree to
share this discovery?

Well,

no, unfortunately, only three
people can share a Nobel.

Oh, that's right.

So he's out?

No, I'm not out.

So he's out?

Neither of us is out.

We think that
the three physicists

should be the ones to win
the Nobel Prize for physics.

Wait, so you want
to cut Amy out?

No, of course not.

We don't want to,
but we're going to.

But she's my wife.

Yes, exactly, she's your wife.

And she's a neuroscientist.

It's like, what's she
even doing on this paper?

It just raises questions.

Look, Fermilab
is going to recommend

the three of us
to the Nobel Committee.

The best chance we have

is if your university
does the same.

I see.

So you really think
that I'm the kind of man

who would sell out his
partner for the chance

of winning a Nobel Prize?

Are you?

Boy, I hope not.

I can't believe
Penny doesn't want

to head up my sales team.

That's too bad.
But...

it's her decision, not yours.

Do you hear how dumb you sound?

Why does this matter
to you so much?

Because I believe in her,
and I make people better.

It's what I do.

Against their will?

It's no fun if they want to.

That's just called watching.

Look at Howard.

He was a disaster
when I met him.

Now he's a foxy astronaut
with a hot wife.

Wait, he always wanted
to be an astronaut.

He thinks that, too.

That's how good I am.

Wait, so what are you gonna do?

Just badger her
until she says yes?

Mm, that may have worked on you,

but she's too smart for that.

Well, if you like fixing people,
I could use some help.

Raj.

Why do you think you stopped
wearing Crocs and socks?

Uh, well, one day I just woke up

and realized they looked silly.

Yes, you did.

All on your own.

That's how good I am.

What's wrong?

Why do you assume
something's wrong?

Because you haven't
touched your dinner,

and you're literally ticking
like a bomb about to go off.

Oh, Amy.

You see through me
like one of Penny's shirts.

Just tell me.

I talked to Doctors
Pemberton and Campbell today.

They reminded me that only

three people can
share a Nobel Prize.

Their university is recommending

the two of them and me.

And they want Caltech
to do the same.

Oh.

They say, if we present
a united front,

we have a much better
shot at winning.

Well, you know,

that makes sense.

Oh, but don't worry.
I won't do that to you.

Maybe you should.

What?

This has been
your lifelong dream.

And you may not
get another chance.

I don't want to be the reason

that you don't win a Nobel.

You're the only
reason I deserve one.

But if your best shot
is with them,

I think you should take it.

Is this really what
you want me to do?

I just want you to be happy.

Thank you.

Hey.

How long have you
been sitting there?

Long enough for two
of your neighbours

to ask if I was lost
and looking for my mother.

I'm not changing
my mind, Bernie.

That's okay. I'm sorry.

It was wrong of me to
badger you into doing

something that made
you uncomfortable.

Thank you.

Mm, it's probably for the best.

I need someone
who's strong and confident

to head up my sales team,
so I'm giving it to Karen.

What... Karen?
Well, what's the job?

Eating my yogurt and
then lying about it?

I'm just saying.

She went to college.
She's really smart.

Well, I'm smarter than Karen.

I can read the word 'Penny'
on a cup of yogurt.

Why are you getting so upset?

I'm agreeing with you.
This is a big job,

and I need someone
who's up to it.

I am up to it. I'm
just nervous about it.

I know. And that's
why I don't want

to pressure you
into doing something

that you clearly
don't want to do.

I know what you're up to.

Is it working?

Yes.

-So I'll see you Monday morning?
-Yes.

I bet I can make
that girl president.

Uh, President Siebert,
Dr. Cooper is...

I need to talk to
you about the paper

that Dr. Fowler
and I published.

Send him in.

Amy and I did this together,

and I will not be part
of an award that does

not recognize the value
of her contributions.

So you either include both of us

in the recommendation letter,
or don't bother writing one.

I hope you know that's
going to cause a fight

between us and
the Fermilab team.

If it's a fight that doesn't
involve any touching,

risk of physical harm
or uncomfortable eye contact

'cause it's happening online
or through intermediaries,

I say bring it.

All right. I respect
your decision.

You do?

Yes. You and Dr. Fowler
have my full support.

Oh.

Okay.

I anticipated a
little more pushback.

Sorry, my job here
is to serve your needs,

both academic and personal.

Huh.

Well, now I'm filled with
all this nervous energy.

I don't know quite
what to do with it.

We have a fully
equipped gymnasium.

Yeah... really?

Where's that?

It's part of the new
sports complex.

Oh.

And where is that?

Come on, I'll show you.

Are there monkey bars?

All right, now,
I'm sure some of you

are wondering,
'Who is this woman?

'How did she get to be
in charge of the sales team?

Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?'

Because she is.

'Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001

and still fits in
those very same jeans?'

'Cause she was, and she does,

and they're actually
a little baggy.

Or is it because she's the
best damn salesperson here?

Because I am.

Now that we're clear on that,

here are the drug specs

and marketing strategy
for Inflamminex.

Which, now that I say it out
loud, might be a placeholder.

By tomorrow, I want everyone

to have this
committed to memory.

Do you have it
committed to memory?

You want to have
a contest, Karen?

Winner gets a yogurt.

No, boss.

All right, now we all know
what we need to do.

Let's go do it.

R... right now.
Get out of here. Go.

That was really impressive.

Damn right it was impressive.

Okay, that tone
doesn't work with me.

Sorry, boss.

Ooh, it's freezing out here.

Would you like me to...

heat things up?

No, I want to get in the
hot tub before I lose a toe.

Oh. That is bright!

Yeah, a new neighbour
put in floodlights. Huh.

So, shall we?

No. I don't want to take my
robe off under a spotlight.

This is a candle body.

Howdy, neighbours!

We haven't met
yet. I'm Andy.

Oh. Hello.
Nice to meet you.

You know, your new balcony kind
of looks right over our fence.

You might want to put up some
trees. We can see everything.

You can, but it's okay
if you don't.

So, can you turn
your lights off?

Sorry, they're motion-sensored.

They'll go off in a minute.
Just try to stay still.

What are we gonna do about this?

I say we wait until
his lights go off,

and then I make hot,
motionless love to you.

Don't move.
It's go time.

And his new balcony looks
right down on our hot tub,

which meant we
couldn't do anything.

So you gave your kids
Benadryl for nothing?

Why do I share with you?
You're such a yenta.

Are we done talking about

Howard's failed
conjugal relations?

I have an actual Nobel
Prize crisis to deal with.

Has anything changed since the
last time you talked about it?

No.

Is there anything
you can do about it?

No.

Then shut up or go
wait in the car!

Excuse me. Remember
you all came here

to check out my cool new laser?

Oh, right. I'm gonna
go wait in the car.

The best part is that
it's europium-based, so...

And then Andy said
if we want privacy,

we should plant some trees.

The only way I know how to
do that is to give a dollar

and tree shows up in Israel.

Okay. Anyway, so because
it's europium-based...

Hey. I need some help
with a meteorite I found.

Ah. I'd be happy to.

Oh, no, I meant Raj.

I really need an astrophysicist.

Wow.

This is exactly like
a dream I had.

Except in the dream,
you're Gal Gadot.

I don't really have dreams,

when I sleep or in life.

Anyway...

I X-rayed this meteorite,
and it looks like there's

some sort of organic
signature inside of it,

but I could really
use another opinion.

Well, great.
Let's go check it out.

Cool.

I'm gonna stay here
and show Howard...

I want to see it!

Okay. Well, thanks for
stopping by.

Screw them. That's cool.

Hey, I'm not sure
we're in the right line.

-Is this for the city zoning office?
-Yes, it is.

Or, as we call it here,
'the zone zone.'

No, we don't.

That's Linda.

Ignore her. She's going
through the change.

Now, how can I help you?

Our neighbour built
a balcony that looks

right into our backyard,
and we're trying to see

if there's anything
we can do about it.

Well, you have come
to the right place.

You know, a lot of people handle
this type of thing online,

but I always say nothing
beats the human touch.

Oh, but don't worry.

I'm not gonna
actually touch you.

We had quite the
informative meeting on that.

We just want a little
privacy in our backyard.

You know, for...

Maybe we should've
done this online.

No, no, no, no. The zone
zone is a safe zone.

Stop saying 'zone zone'!

So, is there anything we can do?

Absolutely. Do you know

if they have permits
for the balcony?

Oh, no. We were hoping
you could check.

I certainly can. I just
need you to fill out a form,

and we have them available
in Armenian, Chinese,

Cambodian, English, Farsi,

Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.

Well, English, obviously.

Well, we're not
allowed to presume.

That was a whole other meeting.

So we just fill out
the form and that's it?

Oh, no.

No, you need to fill it
out, and then you need

to bring it down to the
Office of Code Compliance.

Now, if your neighbours
don't have a permit,

you can file an official complaint,
but if they do have a permit,

then you have to make the case

that the balcony
constitutes a nuisance,

an encumbrance or
an encroachment,

and you have to decide which,

because they are three
totally separate forms.

This is starting to seem like
more trouble than it's worth.

I know, right?

You okay?

Yeah.

Great, 'cause you just bought
that whole row of Batmans.

Sorry, I...

And now you bought Aquaman.
Good choice.

If you want cold medicine,

Stuart has the entire
run of DayQuils,

including the rare
'DayQuilt' misprint from 1996.

What can I say?
I'm a collector.

Thanks, but I'm fine.
I think it's just allergies.

Hi, guys.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Oh, heads up.

If that Aquaman feels wet,
it's not a gimmick.

Leonard sneezed on it.

-You sick?
-Uh, it's just allergies.

Oh. So, check it out.

This meteorite that Bert
found is really cool.

We did a spectrographic
analysis, and there's...

there's definitely
something going on inside.

Well, hey, I... if you want,

we could use my new
laser to cut it open.

Well, thanks, but Bert's
got this water-cooled,

diamond-bladed saw.

Well, sure, but with my laser,
you'd get a thinner slice,

which would make for
a better sample.

Whoa, whoa.

You're not gonna cut
open a meteor, are you?

Have you not learned
anything from comic books?

Space viruses?
Pod people?

I sell nothing but warnings.

C... calm down, Stuart.
You're being a little crazy.

Oh, is he?

Is he being crazy?

Or is he the only one around
here who's making any sense?

It's nice they found each other.

Yeah. Uh, so, anyway,
you want to use my laser?

Eh, sorry. It's kind
of Bert's thing,

and he wants to do it
his way, so...

Okay.

Yeah, that's cool.

Just seems dumb
to not use the laser.

Not as dumb as unleashing
a plague on mankind,

but, hey, what do we know?

Literally nothing.

We spent half the day down
at the city planning office,

and didn't solve a thing.

Now we have to go back tomorrow.

The planning office?
You lucky ducks.

Yeah, this one made
me go for ice cream

and talk about her day.

Spoiler alert:
it was fine.

It wasn't fine. I got
trapped in an elevator.

I may have missed a few details.

The bottom of my
cone was drippy.

So now we have to download
all these forms and fill them out.

We get it. Your life is great.
Stop rubbing it in.

Yeah, quit it.

Is one of the forms
the 599B/C?

Because, if so, it has
a doozy of a typo.

I don't know.

All right, well, I don't
want to spoil anything,

but you might want to start
practising your 'siglature.'

Sheldon, if you like this
stuff, why don't you come

-and do it with us?
-Or instead of us?

Do you mean it?

No, no, wait, it's too late.
You can't take it back. Yes.

Well, Amy,
looks like the elevator

might have been the
high point of your day.

Hey, where's Raj?

Uh, he's working with Bert.

They're probably cutting
their stupid meteorite open

with their stupid diamond saw.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
I'm just a little run-down.

It might be a head cold.

Purell.

Purell.

Purell.

Purell.

Can I top anybody off?

It's just so frustrating.

I... I know my laser would be
way more efficient.

They're gonna lose so much
meteorite due to kerf loss.

Mm.

I'm sorry your friends won't
let you play kerf with them.

Don't make it sound childish.

It's the scientific
word for dust.

What was wrong with 'dust'?

Are you sure you're
not just a little jealous?

No. It's just, my way is better,

but they won't even consider it.

Oh, well, it's their loss.

Look, why don't you go to bed.

I'll run out and get
you some medicine.

Ah, it's okay.

Stuart gave me some when
I was at the comic book store.

Really? You're taking
medicine from Stuart?

Doesn't he need,
like, all of it?

Mm, he's got plenty.

His pill caddy is,
like, this big.

All right, well,
why don't you go to bed.

I'll sleep out here
on the couch.

No, no, no, you take the bed.
I'll stay out here.

Even better. Sweet
dreams, snot bag.

See what I'm talking about?

Oh, yes.

Oh, that is textbook
encroachment.

And I know because
I have the textbook.

First edition.

Watch what happens
when you move.

Oh! Oh, boy, you
weren't kidding.

Oh, those are 10,000
lumens if they're a lumen.

Well, you know what they say:

when life give you lumens,
make lumen-Ade.

Was that a joke?

Yes.

Based on the premise that
'lumen' sounds like 'lemon'?

Yes.

That's hilarious.

Okay, what is the setback
on property lines

in this neighbourhood?

Oh, I don't know.

It must be on the permit
from when you built your deck.

Uh, yeah, my dad built this.

We didn't do
the whole permit thing.

Here we go.

Are you saying

I'm standing on an
unpermitted deck?

It's been here for years,
Sheldon. It's fine.

How did the inspector
not flag this

when he came to check out
your bathroom renovation?

Uh...

Are you telling me
that I have showered

in an uninspected bathroom?

You showered in our house?

You made me hold your children.

What did you expect me to do?

You think you know people.

You do know them, Sheldon.

Yeah, but... but do we?
Do we really know them?

Yes!

They're rule breakers, Amy.

And you know what we
do with rule breakers?

Complain about them
to our spouse

until she's ready to drive
into oncoming traffic?

You can't cross
a double yellow line.

What is this, the Purge?

So, I guess you're
not gonna help them?

Oh, I'm gonna help them...

help them get on the
right side of Johnny Law.

Oh, you can't turn them in.

The city's gonna
make them rip out

all the work they've
done and do it over.

It would be the end
of your friendship.

What choice do I have?
These are the rules.

Sheldon, I am begging you.
Please, don't do this.

You know who doesn't get
permits for their decks?

Animals.

Animals don't have decks.

Oh, really? I have one
word for you: beavers.

Bert? Raj?

Huh.

Can't believe they're
gonna cut that

with this punk-ass diamond saw.

Geez.

Oh, hey, look.

'Siglature.'

Next!

Hello.

Hi! Welcome to the zone zone.

Oh, that's funny!

Hey, I also have a joke for you.

Lumen-Ade.

Maybe I told it wrong.

Well, how can I help you?

If I know someone in violation
of the building code,

should I turn them in?

Interesting question.

Yeah, I know. Because,
on the one hand,

Confucius says we owe
a greater responsibility

to people we're close with
rather than to society at large.

But, on the other hand,
Socrates says that

we're obligated to obey
all laws, even unjust ones.

And then, furthermore,
if we're entertaining rules

about when it's okay
to break the rules,

I should... where does it end?

Well, for me, it ends at 5:00.

Well, I just... I don't
know what to do.

All I can tell you is
that the building codes

are there for everyone's safety.

Oh, so you're saying I have
no choice but to turn them in.

I did not say that.

But would you?

And remember that I laughed
at your 'zone zone' joke.

It's not even a joke!

Oh, is that Linda back there?

-Yeah.
-Aw.

How are her hot
flashes? Any better?

Leonard, what are you doing?

Showing you that this
is the better way.

Stop! Whatever's inside
there is dangerous!

Oh.

And pretty.

What is that?

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm just feeling a little...

hungry.

Stop eating Bert!

Keep eating Bert!

Leonard.

-Leonard!
-What? What?

You're having a bad dream.

Oh, thank God.

I was eating my friends.

Well, one friend
and one acquaintance.

You know what, Bert's okay.
Two friends.

Let me see if you're
running a fever.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, you're burning up.

Geez!

Are you okay?

That depends. What...
what colour are my eyes?

I don't know, brown?

No, green. No, wait, brown.

Oh, good, I'm awake.

Howie, someone's
here to see you.

Hello.

Hey. What's going on?

Can you come over here?

Sheldon, the deck is safe.
You can walk on it.

Oh, that gets the heart going.
Mm.

So, what's up?

I went down to the city
Code Compliance Office

to turn you in.

Are you kidding?

But I didn't do it.

I filled out the form
and then realized

that the unwritten rules
of friendship

are more important
than the written rules

of the city of Altadena's
Zoning and Planning Department.

Aw.

Really? 'Aw'?

And you'll be happy to know
that, while I was there,

I did look into your
neighbour's balcony,

and it is encroaching
on your property line.

I had all this
pent-up snitch energy,

so I reported him hard.

What did they say?

He's going to have to remove it.

So the good guys win?

Well, I don't know if I'd
call you the good guys.

You're enforcing a law on him

that you're wilfully
ignoring yourselves.

Uh, all right, fine.

So the morally
compromised guys win.

Apparently so.

Now, if one of you'd be
kind enough to take me home,

I need to use my bathroom.

What's wrong with the one here?

I'm sorry, I want to live.

Hey. You guys
got a second?

Leonard, I told you, buddy.

We don't need to use your laser.

Yeah, all we need
is Terry Brad-saw.

That's what I named my saw.

No, I... I just wanted to
apologize for yesterday. I just...

I think I was jealous, you know?

Sheldon and Amy
might win a Nobel Prize,

and now you guys have
this cool meteorite project.

-Really? You're jealous of us?
-Yeah.

I even had this crazy dream
last night where I ate you both.

Seriously?

Uh... I know. I was
pretty out of it.

Who'd you eat first?

Oh. Uh, you.

Nice.

This is just delightful.

Do you think he knows we're the
ones that got him in trouble?

Who cares?

I do. I met his wife.

She seems really nice.

Sorry about the
noise, neighbour!

No problem!

Hey, you guys know
a Sheldon Cooper?

No, we do not!

Is it just me or has no one
been in the store for hours?

Yeah, it is weirdly quiet.

Nobody's in the street.

Huh. Well,
that's strange.

You thinking what I'm thinking?

They cut that meteorite open
and unleashed a space plague?

Exactly.

Let me just lock up here.

Okay. So what do we do?

Uh, well, if this is
a worst-case scenario

and we're the last two
people alive, we're gonna,

we're gonna have to
rebuild civilization.

Do you have any special skills?

I can draw.

How 'bout you?

I can play clarinet.

Oh, I didn't know that.

-Yeah, ten years.
-Ah.

You know, it, uh,

might also be up to us to
repopulate the Earth.

I'm okay with that.

So...

shall we?

Wait here. I'm gonna
brush my teeth.

Sorry, we're closed!

This is going on Yelp!

Uh, we sort of have
another reason for...

asking you here.

We want to have a baby,

but we can't do it on our own.

Okay, whoa, whoa.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Yeah, this has been
such a nice evening.

Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?

Oh, you said a thing.

Thank you, guys, again
for agreeing to do this.

Yeah, it means so much to us.

Ah, we're happy we can help.

Yeah, and we don't
find it weird at all.

It's a little weird for us, too.

I mean, instead of our
baby looking like Zack,

it's gonna look like Leonard.

Or Penny if it's a girl.

No, no, it's not gonna look...

Sure.

But I promise,

we're gonna be
really good parents.

Oh, we know you will.

-So, what is the next step?
-Yeah.

Well, Leonard, we were hoping
you'd go in on Monday.

Okay.

And they say,
for the best results,

between now and then,
you shouldn't have sex.

Sorry, bro,

I know it seems impossible
to go for five days without,

but I believe in you.

Five days?
My record is 24 years.

Uh, I think that also means
no flying solo.

Oh.

Then my record is 14 years.

And, well, we're really
hoping for a son.

So just, like, keep that in
mind when you're in there.

Yeah, just think,

'Little boys, little boys.'

Still just totally not weird.

Hello.

Oh, hey, Sheldon.

We're kind of in the
middle of something.

Oh, I won't be a moment.

I just need to grab a
book off a high shelf,

which I can do because I
am both tall and smart.

Sheldon, come home!

They don't want
to have your baby!

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Oh... oh, dear, I think
I got something in my eye.

My piercing, blue eye.

-Sheldon!
-Fine.

I've also never had a cavity
and I don't have asthma...

So...

this week would
have been my wedding

if Anu and I hadn't decided to

slow things down.

Oh, yeah, I would have
forgotten, except for those

non-refundable airline
tickets to India I bought.

I'm sorry.

No, no. What's $3,000
between friends?

Yeah, I probably would've
just thrown it away on

health care for my children.

Uh, if you still want to go,
you can go to India

and help my dad eat
all the non-refundable sushi.

Indian sushi?

I need a change of underwear
just thinking about that.

I really think we made
the right decision.

Agreed, although I did have a...

pretty awesome bachelor party
planned for this weekend.

Really? What was it?

Well, I used my
NASA connections to

get us four seats on that plane

that lets you experience
weightlessness.

The Vomit Comet.
That is so cool.

I've always wanted to
experience weightlessness.

The closest I ever
came was that time

I accidentally set my
scale to kilograms.

I know, it would've
been fun, but, hey,

the next time you decide to
marry a woman you barely know.

We could still go.

You know, make it
a guys' weekend.

Yeah.

All right, let's do it.

Great.

It'll be like the good old days.

You mean when we were all sad,

desperate and horribly alone?

I remember it more fondly.

Leonard, if you had
food on your face,

would you want me to tell you?

Where?

Did I get it?

Oh, no, not now;
it was last week.

I didn't know whether
or not to tell you,

but everyone was staring.

For the record,
it was right there.

And it was Nutella.

Thanks.

You looked like
a hazelnut Hitler.

Hey, who wants to hear
some exciting news?

Oh, what's up?

This weekend, I got us
four seats on the Vomit Comet.

Oh, you lost me at 'vomit,'
you lost me again at 'comet,'

and to be honest, I was
on the fence at 'us.'

Yeah, I can't go either.
Penny's dad is visiting

from Nebraska, and I haven't
seen him for a while.

Oh, that's nice
you guys get along.

I forget, Howard, does your
father-in-law still hate you?

He doesn't hate me.

He's just disappointed
that I'm not

any other man on the planet.

That's how I feel about
Ben Affleck as Batman.

Well, these two are out.

There goes our guys' weekend.

Okay, so...

let's make it a
couples' weekend.

I'll bring Anu,
you bring Bernadette.

I'm not sure
Bernie would like it.

Maybe I'll invite
Stuart or Bert.

Oh, go with Bert!

He's huge. It'd be fun to
watch him float around.

Like that time the
Underdog balloon

got away at the Macy's Parade.

Hey. What are those?

Oh, vitamins.

Zack wants me to take them
to increase my virility.

Zack used the word 'virility'?

He may have said
'wiener power.'

Okay, that's my dad.

Now, remember, do not bring
up any baby stuff, all right?

Not me not wanting one,
not you having one with Zack.

Got it. And if he brings it up,
change the subject

-to literally anything else.
-I got it.

But not the Cornhuskers.
Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.

Is that a sports team?

Never mind, you're good.

-Daddy!
-Hey, Slugger.

Hi.

Aw.

-Hey, Wyatt.
-Leonard.

Hey,

that's a hell of a handshake.

Ah, well,

you know, I've been
taking vitamins.

Dad, uh, come on in, sit down.

Can I get you something
to drink? Maybe a beer?

-Sure, if you're having one.
-Okay.

And why wouldn't you,
since you're not pregnant?

Um...

Leonard wants to have a baby
with my ex-boyfriend Zack.

How 'bout those Cornhuskers?

Hey, would you mind if

Raj and I went
away this weekend?

Well, it is important for you
two to keep the spark alive.

No, just...

the bachelor party
I had planned.

I thought we'd do it anyway.

Oh, so a guys' weekend?

Kinda. I mean, Sheldon
and Leonard couldn't make it,

so Raj invited Anu
and I asked Stuart.

Wait, you invited Stuart
before me?

Actually, I invited
Bert before Stuart,

but I don't know why
I just told you that.

Why didn't you invite me?

Because I know you.

You don't want to float
weightless in an airplane.

What are you talking about?

I love doing crazy
stuff like that.

Bernie, you got sick from
the teacup ride at Disneyland.

Lots of people do.

We were still in line.

So you don't want me to go?

No, I want you to go

if you're gonna have fun.

I don't want you to go
if you're gonna be miserable

and ruin it for everyone.

Which is a long way of
saying I want you to go!

I think this is going
pretty good, huh?

Maybe for you. You
threw me under the bus.

Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.
He was judging me.

Well, yeah, now he's judging me.

I know. It worked.

You two might want to talk
louder or quieter.

In high school, he could
hear me open a can of beer

in my closet under a blanket.

So let me get this
straight, Leonard.

She doesn't want
to have your baby,

but her dumbbell
ex-boyfriend does.

Well, I... no, I wouldn't
say it like that.

How would you say it?

Uh, same words, just less angry.

Well, I don't know
about Los Angeles,

but in Nebraska,

that's kind of strange.

It's strange here, too, and
we have a bakery for dogs.

And you're okay with this?

-I support my husband.
-Thank you.

But, you know,
if you think differently,

you should feel free to say so.

You know, just like,
'Ah!' Make a scene.

Okay, look, they can't
have kids of their own,

and they like that I'm smart,

and they want that
for their child.

No, I get it.

You do?

Sure.

Back on the farm,
we had a prize stallion.

We didn't let that
just go to waste;

we put him out to stud.

No, no, this is...

this is a little
different than that...

No, no, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

Uh, you were comparing me
to a prize stud. Go on.

You have fun with
your new best buddy?

Hey, it's your fault
your dad likes me.

You dated idiots
your whole life.

Well, he was right
about one thing.

I am married to a stud.

Mm. Really?

Yeah, I felt so bad
about selling you out,

I thought I would
maybe make it up to you.

Wait, wait. I can't.

I mean, I want to,

but I'm not supposed to
for the next three days.

Oh. That's right.
I forgot.

All right, well, guess
I'll just read a little

and then... I don't
know... go to sleep.

Really? That's what
you're sleeping in?

Oh, you want me to take it off?

No.

All right. Well, then pipe down

and let me read my comic book.

Penny, I... I know
what you're doing.

Just please stop.

Ooh, listen to this.

'Bam.

'Pow.

Take that, Batman.'

Thanks again for
doing this, guys.

-Of course.
-So excited.

I'm glad you came.

Howard made it sound like
this wasn't your kind of thing.

He did say that, but here I am.

So what does he know?

I'm sorry. I just...

didn't think you'd enjoy
plummeting to the Earth

at 400 miles an hour.

I love going fast,

unlike Grandma here, poking
along at 70 miles an hour.

Am I right?

I've always wanted to do this.

I'm an adrenaline junkie.

Roller coasters, snowboarding,

dating men who bathe
with their dogs.

It was during a drought.

I'm a thrill-seeker, too.

I've had to pull back
since I became a mom,

but I'll still jump on
the back of a grocery cart

and just roll through
the meat section.

And I'm married to her,
which is quite the ride.

Amy?

There's something out here.

Just trap it under a cup,

and I'll be there in a minute.

I'll try, but it's Leonard.

What?

Well, what is he doing here?

I told you, if we left
pizza on the counter,

we'd attract something.

Oh, hey, guys.

Sorry. I used my key.

I just needed a place to crash.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, I...

had to get out of the apartment.

My wife kept trying
to have sex with me.

Been there.

Why are you trying
to avoid having sex?

Well, we just did
it three weeks ago.

I was talking
to Leonard!

Well, I... I have to go
to the clinic

for Zack and Marissa on Monday,

and I'm supposed
to save myself until then.

Sounds like...

maybe Penny's not totally
on board with that plan.

Well, she said she was.

But she also said I looked dope.

Honestly, I don't even
think I looked fly.

So you're willing
to go through with this,

even though she clearly
has reservations?

If she has a problem,
she should say something.

She tried to seduce you.

If that's not a cry for help,
I don't know what is.

Penny doesn't want to have kids.

I respect that. But...

this is my chance to
leave a part of me behind.

Okay, but this isn't
gonna make you a dad.

It's gonna be their
baby, not yours.

Although, someday,

if that kid wants
to know why he's short,

near-sighted, and asthmatic...

he may hunt you down.

Are you guys ready

for the most intense
experience of your life?

-Yes.
-Definitely.

Not to brag, but
I'm an astronaut,

so I've been weightless before.

Can be pretty scary.

Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.

I'm weightless every time

I hold more than three balloons.

Okay, I just need you guys
to sign these waivers,

and then you can go get changed.

There are a lot of pages here.

Is this a waiver or a screenplay
you've been working on?

I'm sure it's just boilerplate.

Absolutely. It's to protect
us in case of injury.

It says, 'Or death.'

Which is awesome.

Done. Where are the
changing rooms?

Dressing rooms are in the back.

No peeking.

Here you go.

Okay. Should we go get changed?

Yeah.

Hang on a second.

What?

Just... I have two
babies at home.

What am I doing?

If you don't want to do this,
then why'd you come?

To prove to Howard
that he doesn't know me

as well as he thinks he does.

Looks like he does.

Unless I do it and
then he doesn't.

Why not just be honest?

You're right.

I should be honest.

You owe me $3,000 for those
plane tickets to India!

Hey.

That was a long run.

Yeah. Well,
I was in the zone.

You know, and then
in a diner and then

in a massage chair at the
mall where I fell asleep.

Are you avoiding me?

Well, I took a nap
next to Hot Dog on a Stick.

What do you think?

I think you're mad at me
and Leonard,

but maybe...

you're really mad at yourself.

Why would I be mad at myself?

'Cause you regret this

'no baby' plan of yours.

You know, it's
pretty crappy of you

to make me feel bad about this.

I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

But...

do you?

Yes.

I feel like I'm
letting everybody down.

Hate disappointing Leonard,

but I really hate
disappointing you.

Oh, Slugger, you could
never disappoint me.

Okay, your high school
years were a little rough.

And I'm sorry about that.

There was you
sneaking out at night

and your boyfriends
sneaking out in the morning.

I said sorry.

That time you got drunk
and stole a horse.

Yeah.

I was there.
I remember.

Parts of it.

But besides all that,

being your dad is the best
thing ever happened to me.

What about Randall and Lisa?

They're okay.

I just don't want
you to miss out.

I know.

But if this is really
what you want...

or don't want...

I'm on your side.

Thanks.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.

Sure.

What's up?

I want you to back off.

You know? I... if...

Penny and I don't have
kids, that's between us.

So you need to stay out of it.

Oh, Leonard, it's okay.
We talked. We're good.

Oh.

Okay, you could've
stopped me sooner.

Could've let you go longer.

Uh-huh.

You did great, Leonard.
Very forceful.

Yeah?

I... I... I felt like my voice
was a little shaky there.

Um...

Hey,

I decided to not go through

with this Zack
and Marissa thing.

Really?

But you were so
excited about it.

I know. But, um...

I think I was just
fooling myself.

I...

I would be heartbroken

if I had a kid out there
and I wasn't his dad.

I know you would.

Yeah.

So, that thing you
wanted to do last night,

I'm available.

I got real good
hearing there, stud.

All right, everyone's suited up.

Let's head out to the tarmac!

Actually, one second.

Howie, I don't think
I should do this.

Really?

Well, I did not see that coming.

Just... we have kids,

and it's not smart to
put us both in danger.

That's a good point.

When I was little, my
parents never flew together.

We thought it was
because they loved us,

but it turns out
they hated each other.

See?

I just think I shouldn't go.

Actually, this is much safer
than driving a car.

Stay out of it, fly-boy!

You're right.

But I've done this before.

And since you really,
really want to go,

I'll stay here.

Oh. Great.

Unless you don't want to

because I was right
and I do know you.

Well, if you really know me,

then you know how far I'll go
to prove a point.

Apparently, 34,000 feet that
way, then straight back down,

up and down, over and over again

until you throw up food
you didn't even eat.

They are definitely
your weirdest friends.

If only that were true.

I hate this so much!

Why am I doing this?

To prove a stupid
point to your husband!

Oh, right.

Worth it.

Hey, Zack. Um...

look, I... I know this is
gonna be disappointing,

but, um, I... I can't do this.

No, no, no, no.

I... I, I know how. I just can't.

But, hey, look,
I... if you like,

I... I know someone
who might be interested.

No! Absolutely not!

I'm sorry, my wife
says I'm not allowed.

All right,
Professor Proton fans,

get ready to meet
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,
a pair of real-life scientists

who may win the Nobel Prize.

That's like the
Kids' Choice Award,

but with more science
and less slime.

Hi, thanks for having us.

Kids' Choice Award?

Why would they let kids
choose anything?

They're basically
human larvae.

Well, they are kind of
our target audience.

Greetings, children.

Toys, am I right?

He is. He has hundreds of them.

So you two have
discovered something

that a lot of people
are really excited about.

We have.

Now, before
you explain it,

keep in mind that our
average viewer is this many.

Okay,

imagine you're
looking in a mirror.

The image you see
looks just like you.

That's called symmetrical.

Now imagine you have
a billion mirrors,

and each of them reflects
one thing about you correctly

and a billion things
about you incorrectly.

And imagine the set
of incorrect things

are floating in an abstract
n-dimensional hyperspace.

Now imagine there was never
a mirror to begin with.

Oh, was that
a doorbell?

I didn't
hear anything.

Huh, there it is again.

Sheldon, why don't
you answer it?

But I don't know who it is.

Maybe it's a special guest who
I invited just to surprise you.

Why don't you open it up
and find out.

This is a terrible message
to send to children.

Children, you never
open the door

if you don't know
who's on the other side.

You always make your
mommy or daddy do it

while you hide under the bed
and try to imagine

what your superhero name will be

when you avenge their deaths.

I'll get it.

But it can't be The Silver
Shadow... that's mine.

Hello.

Captain on the bridge!
Captain on the bridge!

You're William Shatner.

You can call me Bill.

-Ooh, can I call you Captain?
-No.

-Please?
-No.

Please?

Sure.

And w... will you call me
Science Officer Cooper?

This has got to stop.

I think you know
how to make it stop.

Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.

Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.

Oh, poor Shatner.

Poor Shatner?
I have to eat lunch now.

Look, Sheldon's
pretty embarrassed,

so when he gets here,
we should...

-Make fun of him?
-A lot.

Guys, don't you think
that's a little mean?

Yeah.

Okay, just so we're
all on the same page.

Yeah.

-Hello.
-Hey.

So, Sheldon,
did you get

William Shatner's autograph,
or maybe his dry cleaning bill?

Very funny, get it all out.

Like you did on William Shatner?

Raj, do you have
something to add?

You brought shame upon
yourself and your family.

It's not funny,
but it's true.

I will admit the meeting
did not go the way I wanted.

Because you barfed where
no man has barfed before?

Well, the next time I meet
him, it will go better.

Next time? What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

Wil will give me another chance.
He thinks the world of me.

Aw.

One of the reasons I love you
is you actually believe that.

Thank you.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Wil Wheaton.

Now's not a good time, Sheldon.

-For what?
-You.

I need to apologize.

Apology accepted.

Wil, come on,
I cast fireball,

you need to roll
your dexterity save.

I'll be right there.

Are you playing
Dungeons & Dragons?

No.

Would you hurry up, man,

the map says this
dungeon's full of dragons.

Still no.

Who are you playing with?

Ugh... it's just some friends,
you don't know them.

Wheaton, get back here.

Hobgoblins
are at the gate,

and you're at the door
buying Girl Scout Cookies.

-Is that William Shat...?
-Nope.

Hey, you guys want to read
my fan fiction mash-up,

'Captain Marvellous Mrs. Maisel'?

-Nope.
-No.

Certainly not.

You don't even know
what it's about.

Is it about
a superhero

who finds her voice
by doing stand-up?

That's so much better
than what I had.

Mine is just a Jewish
girl that flies.

I'd read that.

Guys, guys,

Wil Wheaton hosts a
secret celebrity D&D game.

-How do you know?
-Who was there?

Why are you damp?

I was trying to peek
in Wil's window,

and he turned the sprinklers on.

Oh, that means they
must be really famous.

I'm almost positive
I heard William Shatner.

I wonder who else is playing.

I... I bet we can use graph theory
to determine who Wil knows

-and who is likely to play D&D.
-Yes.

Okay,

obviously he's connected to
the whole Next Gencast...

So this is the rest
of our night, huh?

Oh, no,

this is the rest of our lives.

And Josh Brolin gets
you to every Avenger.

Kevin Smith's
in this article

about celebrities who play D&D.

Oh! A... and he was
on Wil's podcast,

so they know each other.

G... go on his Instagram,
see if you can find anything.

Yeah, he... he posted
something an hour ago:

'#GameNight.'

That looks like Wil's house.

William Shatner,

Kevin Smith...
who else could be there?

Do you see what I see
over his shoulder?

Is that a ghost?

I think it's Stuart.

That is Stuart.
What... what's he doing there?

Maybe he died in Wil's house

and he can't leave
until he solves his own murder.

Why would Wil invite
Stuart and not us?

-I know the answer.
-Yeah.

We all know the answer.

Hey, guys.

You're home late.

Uh, yeah.

I had a crazy night.
I went to the pharmacy.

I like to be there when
the new decongestants drop.

Cut the crap.
We know where you were.

We know what
you were doing.

Yeah, I just told you. I was
at CVS breathing my ass off.

Oh, you were
breathing, all right.

You were breathing the
rarefied air of celebrities.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Then why are
you trembling?

I'm always trembling.

We know you were
at Wil's D&D game.

We saw you on Instagram.

We just want to know
how you got invited.

I can't talk about it or they
won't invite me back next week.

So there's another
game next week.

I didn't mean to say that.

-Who's in it?
-I can't tell you!

-How do we get invited?
-I don't know!

How many hit dice are they
playing the wereboar as having?

12d8 + 24...
I mean, I don't know!

Hey, Stuart.

I don't want to play anymore.
It's too much pressure.

-Why, what happened?
-I've... I've said too much.

You haven't said anything.

-Not to you, to them.
-Who's them?

Ah! Now I have said too much!

But y... you blocked
your number, right?

Relax, this is not my
first creepy phone call.

It's like riding a bike...

slowly past a girl's house.

Hello.

Wil, Bill Shatner here.

Is this Howard?

Of course not.

It... it's Shatner.

If you don't believe me,

ask my good friend,
Christopher Walken.

Hello, Bill and I are just
hanging out...

at The Polo Lounge.

Mr. Shatner, Mr. Walken,
here are your Martinis.

What are you doing?

-I'm filling out the world.
-You're ruining it.

-No, he's not.
-Thanks, Wil.

Sheldon, why are you
walking everywhere?

Just get a horse.

I had a horse.
It got hit by a train.

Get another one.

I can't just replace Chauncey.

I'm still in the
grieving process.

Hey.

Hey, Leonard, I have an opening
in my D&D game next week,

and I was wondering if you
were interested in playing.

Well, yes, thank you.

Okay, great.

Now, here's the thing,
you can't tell anyone.

I'm serious,
not Howard, not Raj,

and certainly not Sheldon.

Okay.

I'm really sorry
to put you in a position

where you have to lie
to your friends...

See you there!

You come face to face
with a massive monster

with a gaping maw full of teeth,

three huge legs, and
flailing tentacles.

What do you do?

Fellas, it looks like
we're facing a, an otyugh.

Here's the plan...

Hold on there, Bill.

Now what, Kareem?

How do we know
it's not a Neo-otyugh?

Same way I know
the difference

between an owlbear
and a bugbear.

Does that answer
your question?

No.

Look, there's one way
to settle this:

we chop it up
and look at the pieces.

Oh, come on, why do you always
got to attack everything?

Why can't we just try
talking to it?

Big surprise, Podcast
here wants to talk.

What do you think, Leonard?

I think this is the greatest
day of my entire life.

It's all right, buddy,
one day you'll meet a girl.

Hey, how was your lecture?

Oh, it was so good.

I... I... I mean, it...
it started great,

and then the, the
middle was great,

and then the ending was like...

So great.

Leonard, if you went to House
of Pies again, just say it.

Wait, if you think I'm lying,

why do you think
I'm eating pies?

Why don't you think I'm...
having an affair?

Listen, it... it's fine, just
next time, bring me a slice.

Okay, well, if you
really want to know,

I'll tell you where I was.

I was at Wil's D&D game,
but that's all I can say.

Oh, fun. Were there
famous people there?

Ah, sorry, I... I...
I can't tell you that.

Okay, well, yes,

but I... I... I...
I can't tell you who.

Well, no, I... I can
tell you Shatner,

but that's only because
you already knew that one.

-Well, I'm glad you had fun.
-Yeah.

Ugh, I wish I could tell you
who else was there.

I can't, I promised.

Yeah, if it makes you feel
better, I couldn't care less.

That's true,

you don't care, so there's
no harm in telling you.

Okay, you really
don't have to.

All right,
I'll tell you. Uh...

Kevin Smith was there,

and.. and, uh, this really
tall guy named Kareem.

Wait... wait, K... Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar?

I don't know, it was, uh,
Kareem something Jabbar.

How do you know him?

How do you not know him?

Well, I know him now
'cause he was there.

Wow.

That is so cool.

Oh, a... and that, uh,
the guy that played

the werewolf on... on
True Blood, he was there.

Wh... Joe Manganiello?

-Uh, yeah.
-From Magic Mike?

What's that?

Okay, okay, did he look...

like this?

He had his clothes
on, but, yeah.

I can't believe you
met Joe Manganiello.

-Is he nice?
-Oh, he's so nice.

I... I... I rolled my dice
underneath the couch,

and he just lifted
it up, one hand.

Oh, I... I bet he did.

Hi. Okay, can you guys
keep a secret?

-Yeah.
-Sure.

Good, 'cause I can't.

Leonard played
Dungeons & Dragons

with the hot guy
from Magic Mike.

I never got to see that movie.

Seriously?

Yeah, Howie made us leave

as soon as he realized
it wasn't about magic.

Well, I have seen that movie
one or seven times,

and trust me, it is magic.

Which guy?

That one.

Abracadabra.

Hey, you know what was fun?

That time we played
Dungeons & Dragons.

That was fun.

We should play that more.

Sorry, what now?

Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon
might have left something.

Oh, you mean, besides his lunch?

You are so funny, Wil.

We were just talking
about how funny you are.

Yeah, Leonard told
you, didn't he?

-Yeah.
-Yup.

-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

-It's Manganiello?
-Uh-huh.

-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

-Feel good about yourselves?
-Nope.

-No.
-Yeah.

Oh, we're going
with no? No.

Hey, guys.

What are you
smiling about?

What? This is my regular face.

No.

It's not. Y... your regular
face is more like this...

No...

no, it's... it's more in
the eyebrows, like this...

Okay, make your jokes.

I'm still in a great mood.

Hey.

Wait, what?

Why?

Oh, come on, but...

O... okay, fine.

Huh, Raj was right,
it is more in the eyebrows.

What was that all about?

Wil kicked me out
of his D&D game.

You were
in Wil's D&D game?

-With William Shatner?
-And you didn't tell us?

I'm sorry, Wil made
me promise not to.

I thought
we were friends.

Oh, come on, you guys
would do the same thing.

No, we wouldn't!
I told you when I was

in spin class with
Scarlett Johansson.

It didn't even turn out
to be Scarlett Johansson.

Well, that's her
fault, not mine!

It doesn't matter

because Penny blabbed
about it and now I'm out.

So there's an open seat.

-Wil!
-Wil Wheaton!

Open! Open!

No. No. No.

Hell no.

Look, we know Leonard is out.
You need to fill a seat.

It should be one of us.

Or give me another chance.

I think me and Joe Manganiello
were really hitting it off.

-Joe Manganiello was there?
-From Magic Mike?

You guys suck.

Agreed. You guys suck.
Let's go, Wil.

No.

All of you.

You're just
trying to use me

to get close
to my famous friends.

Do you know how
that makes me feel?

Flattered?

Used.

I was gonna
guess that.

One of the worst things
about being a celebrity

is you never know if people
like you for you.

Well, thanks
for letting me know.

You're right, that was
really crappy of us.

Yeah, I guess we just got
caught up in the excitement.

We're sorry, Wil.
We do like you for you.

And if it makes you
feel any better,

I don't even really
consider you a celebrity.

Should we go or do you want
to wait for the sprinklers?

Guys, I... I still feel
a little bad about Wil.

Me, too.

Yeah. We should invite him
to come play with us.

Ask him to bring some chips
because we're all out.

Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.

Make it Bugles.

No, no, no, no, no,
pretzel sticks.

No, no, no, Bugles.

We're gonna play some D&D

and thought you might
want to join us.

Thank you, Leonard, but
actually I can't do it tonight.

Uh, how about another time?

Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

Okay, where were we?

I was about to go all
Wrath of Khanon the ogres.

Oh, man, that's it.

Put another dollar
in the Star Trekjar, Bill.

Worth it.

Speaking of putting
dollars in things...

I loved you
in Magic Mike.

Thanks.

Switch places with me.

Are we playing musical chairs
or Dungeons & Dragons?

Yeah, let's teach that ogre
what my broadsword tastes like.

I like your moxie.

Aw, and I like
your grandpa words.

My dad and I watched you win
back-to-back championships.

And I watched you sniff Joe's
hair when he wasn't looking.

Thank you again for inviting us,
and don't worry,

we won't tell the guys.

You know what, why
don't you tell the guys?

In fact, let's all
take a picture

and send it to
them right now.

That's weird.

We deserve that.

The drug I've been working
on for the past five years,

just got approved by the FDA.

-Wow.
-Oh.

Congratulations. Was that the
decongestant you developed?

No, we had to re-brand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.

It's her anti-inflammatory drug.

Oh.

Yep, three years of testing
and no reported side effects.

-Hmm, so it works.
-Eh.

Well, congratulations,
I'm so happy for you.

Yeah, well, I'm happy for you

because I want you
to head up my sales team.

Really? Me? Don't you want
someone with more experience?

No, the job's all yours.

All right, now I'm sure
some of you are wondering,

'Who is this woman?

'How did she get to be in
charge of the sales team?

Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?'

Because she is.

'Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001

and still fits
in those very same jeans?'

Because she was, and she does

and they're actually
a little baggy.

'And the absence of side effects
means that Inflaminex

'can be taken in conjunction
with other medications.

It's a brand-new day.'

Such a good tag-line, I forgot,
who came up with that?

-You did.
-That's right, I did.

Okay, I know it's late
and I've been

working you guys really hard,

so I have a little
treat for you.

We get to go home?

No. You get to stay here
and get vitamin B12 shots.

Oh, my God.
You guys are still here?

We're happy to be here.
It's a brand-new day.

It's 12:15, it's literally
a brand-new day.

Everybody go home.

All right, fine. Go, get out of here.
Go on.

I think things
are going pretty good.

Are you aware that Dave's
in the break room crying?

Yeah, I told him
if he's gonna be a crybaby,

go to the break room.

I just really want to be
prepared for this conference.

You're gonna do great.

You really think so?

Of course; they're
scared of you,

you're scared of me...
The system works.

Okay, Howie, I'm going.

-Have a great conference.
-Thanks.

Remember, I'm leaving
you with two babies.

I expect to see two
babies when I get back,

and they better be the same
two babies because I'll know.

I think I'm capable
of babysitting.

Don't call it babysitting;
they're your children.

It's called parenting.

What's the difference?

You don't get paid.

Now, the emergency
contacts are on the fridge

and I left money for
food on the table.

Oh, sounds like I do get paid.

Don't worry.
I got this covered.

I know you do.

Quick question, where
are the kids right now?

They're upstairs.

-They're at daycare.
-They're at daycare?

-They're upstairs!
-Why are you messing with me?

Wow. That's a lot of
luggage for a weekend.

I know. I didn't
know what to wear,

so I brought a few options.

Was one of the options the
option to never come back?

I just really want
this weekend to go well.

Doesn't answer my
question, but okay.

I love you.

-I love you, too.
-Thanks.

And you're gonna do great.

Just relax, stay out of your
head, and try to enjoy it.

Aw. That reminds me
of what I said to you

the first time we
slept together.

-I still use it. It's a mantra.
-Yeah.

Oh, thank goodness!
I caught you before you left.

I'm just going for the weekend.

Just the weekend.
You all heard her say it.

So, your convention is
in San Diego, right?

Yes.

Great. I need you to settle
a bet for Amy and me.

I say, when it's not Comic-Con,

no one will be dressed
as superheroes.

Mm-hmm.

And I say fewer people will
be dressed as superheroes

but still some.

A crazy person in a
cape doesn't count.

Mm, why not?
It counts at Comic-Con.

Also, if you get a chance
to sneak into Hall H,

last year, I left my neck
pillow under my seat.

Uh, third row,
second from the aisle.

I'll see what I can do.

Thank you.

At least there will be
one superhero in San Diego.

So, Leonard, what are you
gonna do while Penny's away?

I don't know.

Maybe watch a movie
with subtitles.

If you're looking for
something outside the norm,

I have invented
a new chess variant

where the bishops can
also move like knights.

What do you call that,
Bishops Be Crazy?

First of all, it would
be 'Bishops Are Crazy.'

Not if you're being crazy.

Checkmate.

Hey, guys.

-Hey.
-Hello.

Where are the kids?

I thought they were with you.

What? No!

I... I'm kidding.
They're at daycare.

What about me makes you think

my heart can handle that joke?

Hey.

You guys want to

come hang out at my
place this weekend?

So we can help you babysit?

Uh, it's not babysitting.

They're my children.

They're not our children.

Oh. Well, for you guys,
then, it is babysitting.

No offence, Howard, but
I don't want to spend

my weekend around your
loud, sticky babies.

You can't insult my
kids. I am offended.

N... no, you can't be.
I said 'no offence.'

That's like 'no backsies'
but for offence.

What do you say? We'll
play some board games.

It'll be like a party.

Three guys playing a board game

doesn't sound
like much of a party.

Someone doesn't
remember college very well.

As opposed to the leading
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory,

our product greatly
reduces the risk of ulcers.

So it won't burn a hole
in your stomach.

And it won't burn a hole
in your wallet, either!

Okay.

I got this.

Thank you for stopping by.
It's a brand-new day!

See? You're doing great.

Yeah. Mediocre actress,
great drug pusher.

Who knew?

Inflaminex, huh?

So what can you
tell me about it?

-Well, we...
-Oh, don't waste your time.

His name is Danny.

He works for one of the
other drug companies.

Hey, nothing wrong with
checking out the competition.

Aw, we don't see you
as competition.

You should.

Our anti-inflammatory is hitting
the market this year, too.

Well, ours has zero
drug interaction risk.

Yeah. So does an Altoid.

Speaking of Altoids,
why don't you go get one?

Okay.
Let's everyone calm down.

If you can't find
a pill for that here,

then you're not trying
hard enough.

It's all right.

I'll go.

I don't know what
it is about that guy,

but he just gets on my nerves.

Well, you scared
the bad man away.

Who's a good girl?

They're still asleep.

Apparently, when
I put someone down for a nap,

they sleep hard.

That's a weird brag, Howard.

I'll get it.

Bernadette thinks I have
poor parenting skills.

Maybe she's basing that on
your poor husbanding skills.

Who can say?

I'm bad at a lot of things.

-Hello.
-Hi.

Hey. I didn't think
you were coming.

Um, I changed my mind.

I thought it'd be fun to spend
some time with your children.

Where are the little scamps?

'Scamps'?

I'm sorry. Tykes. Rug rats.

What is the PC term these days?

What's going on?

We were in the book store,
and I found this.

Experimenting with Babies:

50 Amazing Science Projects
You Can Perform on Your Kid.

You can't experiment
on his kids.

Yeah, you're not their father.

You can't experiment on my kids.

Fine. Can I at least
play a game with them?

Perhaps...

How Developed
is Your Peripheral Vision?

Mine's great.
I saw that.

You know, these experiments
are pretty harmless.

There's one where you just put
the baby in front of a mirror

and you watch them
watch themselves.

That sounds adorable.
Let me see.

How come when she talks
about experiments on babies,

you think it's adorable,
but when I do it,

everyone gets upset?

I think I can speak
for all of us.

You're just creepy.

No offence.

Hey, this one we can do
with both Michael and Halley.

It's called Grabby Hands.

Wasn't that your nickname
in high school?

No, it was Mama's Boy.

But the joke was on them,
because I love my mom.

Guys, listen,

you secure them both
in car seats

and slowly spin a toy

at the end of the
string above them.

The younger baby tends to
reach with either hand,

and the older baby prefers
the dominant hand.

That is kind of interesting.

And it's not really
experimenting on the kids.

It's more like experimenting
with the kids.

Well, I guess
if you think about it,

it's kind of like
playing games with them.

Okay, you know what,
when they wake up,

we can try one or two of these.

Yay!

I said, 'Yay!'

Thank you.
It's a brand-new day.

Wow, we got
a pretty good crowd here.

I know. But not
as big as that booth.

What's going on over there?

Yeah, that's Chantix.

Ray Liotta's signing
autographs until 2:00.

Hey, I thought we
weren't supposed

to have our phones in the booth.

That's a 'you' rule,
not a 'me' rule.

Hey, can I help you?

Actually, I'm looking
for the bathroom.

Ah, yes. It's right next
to the laxative booth.

Clever, right?

So we meet again.

Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right?
How's your launch going?

Good.

Is Dr. Rostenkowski around?

No, she stepped out for a call,
although I wouldn't be surprised

if she's in line
to meet Ray Liotta.

Yeah. Something tells me
she's not crazy about me.

Yeah. Something tells me that,
too, and it was her.

Well, it doesn't matter, I was
actually hoping to talk to you.

-Really?
-Yeah.

You've done a terrific job
with Inflaminex.

We're always on the lookout
for great salespeople.

I think we could make you happy.

Uh, thanks,
but I'm pretty happy.

I could be more happy. Tell
it to your shrink, Karen.

Hey, Howie, everything okay?

Yeah, everything's great.

I was just wondering if we had
any large barbecue tongs.

Uh, bottom left drawer.
Are you guys grilling?

Nope, just playing games
with the kids.

Why do you need tongs?

Love you, too, bye.

I... I bet Michael grabs it
before Halley.

Not a chance.

Halley's a year older, you
know she's gonna get it first.

I just think he wants it more.
Come on.

Come on, you got this.
You got this, Michael

Grab it. Grab it, Halley.
I believe in you.

Oh! That was so close.
Just keep on trying.

Hey. Hey, y... you guys want to
make this more interesting?

By establishing
a double-blind protocol

so we have a foundation
to publish? Yes.

Look, here's my card.

Maybe we can get a
drink this weekend.

Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty busy.

I have to inventory
all the giveaways.

Hey, beat it. Shoo.

So what did he want?

-Nothing.
-He offered her a job.

No one likes a
tattle-tale, Karen.

So, what's up, traitor?

Dammit, Karen.

Okay, you want to
engage the babies.

The subjects.

The babies.

Fine. The babies.

Baby-A and Baby-B.

Engage them for a minute and
take note of their reactions.

There's something familiar
about all this.

Okay, go.

Hello, baby.

Are you having a pleasant day?

Oh, my G...

This is my entire childhood.

Leonard, Leonard,
you're tainting my data.

Uh, it's like word for word.

How much time is left?

35 seconds.

Oh really? He's not
reacting at all.

Sheldon, he's a baby.

That's not how you talk
to him, okay? J... just watch.

Hey.

Halley.

Who's your favourite uncle?

Unka Koo.

I got a dud, let's switch.

Keep trying. It's for science.

Is that all I was to her?
Just an experiment?

Michael. Michael,
you're making me look bad.

I... interact with me.

He grabbed my finger.

Oh, he's smiling.
I'm doing it.

-That's time.
-Oh, really?

Can we do one more?

I think these guys need
to get some food.

By pushing a lever at the end

of an obstacle course
that we design?

No, by opening the door

to a hangar and letting
the airplane fly in.

Although, Sheldon, maybe
it could be an experiment.

Are you suggesting
we colour-code their food

so we can examine
their diapers later?

Sure.

These diapers
are gonna be full of data.

I never thought I would see
Sheldon enjoying himself

around babies so much.

Yeah, how about that?

So he just happened
to stumble upon a book

about experimenting
with them the same day

we were hanging out
with Howard's kids?

Yep, don't over-think it.

Oh, my God. At sleep-away camp

my cabin was called
'Control Group.'

I can't believe you took
his business card.

I can't believe we're still
talking about this.

He handed it to me.
What was I supposed to do?

Hand it back to him and tell him

to stick it where
the sun don't shine.

You are not serious.

Serious as the hepatitis

their cholesterol medication
gave thousands of people.

Did it?

Maybe.

You're not really
considering this, are you?

I don't know.
It's kinda flattering.

Please, he's just
using you to get to me.

Or he's trying to get to me

because I'm really good
at my job.

Don't be so naive.

They're our number
one competitor.

They have a rival drug
coming out

with a name I wish
we thought of... Forsootha.

It's got 'soothe' right in it.

How did we miss that?

You know, our brand recognition

is three times
higher than theirs.

And I did that with a stupid
product name and no assistant.

You only have this job
because I gave it to you.

You know who else
was begging you

to head up their sales team?
Nobody.

Well, you know who's
begging me now? Danny.

I can't believe this
is how you thank me.

I thanked you by thanking you.

And I sent you that
fancy box of pears.

What am I supposed
to do with 20 pears?

Have a pear party?

Ooh, a juicy pear.

Where are the kids?

Oh, Sheldon's helping Howard
give them a bath.

Hmm. So you really think

you can trick Sheldon
into liking babies?

I slept with him;
I married him.

You want to be against me?

Oh, you were right, Amy.

There were so many
valuable experiments

to perform on them
during bath time.

You don't say.

I do. I tested their object
permanence with a rubber duck,

and we took a run at
Archimedes' water displacement,

but that went
right over their heads.

Well, I'm glad
you had a good day.

I did. It's so funny,

we did all these
experiments on them

and they didn't even notice.

I know, I was worried
it would be obvious,

but it wasn't.

I guess we should go and let
Howard get them ready for bed.

Yeah. Do you think he'd let us
come back and do some more?

Maybe we could take them
to the park.

Smart. There'll be more babies.

It's a bigger sample size.

Where did Leonard go?

Just tell me the truth, Mother.

Was my whole childhood
just one big experiment?

Of course not, dear.

It was thousands
of small experiments.

So that's all I was to you,
a... a test subject?

No, you were my baby
and I found you fascinating.

Really?

Yes, watching you develop,
tracking your progress.

I know I'm not
the warmest of parents,

but it was time
we spent together,

and, honestly, those are
some of my fondest memories.

When did you stop?

Oh, I can't tell you,

the experiment isn't over.

Zangen's a fine company.

They got a couple of good drugs,

but we control 60%
of the market.

Hell, commissions on just
our fungal creams

will put you in a new Mercedes.

Danny. Danny, look at me.

Does this face
sell fungal creams?

No. This face is
cholesterol drugs and above.

Playing hard to get, huh?

No one's ever accused
me of that before.

Look, why don't I
just give you a number

and see what you think?

Ooh, are... are you gonna
write it on a napkin

and slide it over to me?

No, I was just gonna say it.

Aw.

Do you want me to
write it on a napkin

and slide it over to you?

Yah.

You got it.

Danny, you rat bastard.

What? I'm just making
your friend an offer.

Yeah, he's writing it on
a napkin like in the movies.

That's not an offer.

Do you know how
amazing this girl is?

-Aw. You think I'm amazing?
-Stay out of this.

I'm serious..

Not only is she
a helluva salesperson,

she's the hardest worker
I've ever seen.

I know, that's why I'm trying
to steal her from you.

Well, then you're gonna have
to do a lot better than this,

because I promise you,

I'm not gonna let her
go without a fight.

You do not want that,
she's a biter.

Just think about it.

You know, I don't have to.

Thanks, but I'm
happy where I am.

Let's go.

Can I just see
what he wrote on the napkin?

What napkin?

You know,

spending time with
Michael and Halley today

really made me think
about our future children.

Huh, what an interesting

and completely
unforeseen development.

What are you thinking?

Well, I just can't decide.

Either five sets of triplets

or three sets of quintuplets.

You know what?

It doesn't matter as
long as they're healthy.

And divisible by three.

That's a lot of babies, Sheldon.

Oh, only for humans.

For frogs, it's just
a drop in the bucket.

Well, I'm sorry I'm not a frog.

Oh, don't feel bad, Amy.

You're good enough for me.

We just published
a few months ago.

How did you have time
to design an experiment?

This whole thing is actually
a gigantic accident.

You weren't even thinking
about super-asymmetry?

Thinking about it?

We don't even understand it.

Uh, can you believe this?

Doctors Pemberton and
Campbell have been doing

a press tour trying to take
credit for super-asymmetry.

So what?

I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

for accidentally
discovering something.

Yeah, who remembers the guy

who was trying to find India

and discovered America instead?

What was his name again?

Now stop trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

You come up with your own idea.

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

Have a seat,
thanks for being here.

I feel the same way about you.

-Wonderful.
-This is nice.

All my friends hanging
out, watching Ellen.

It's like, what am I gonna do
with my other two wishes?

It's not nice. She's
having on the scientists

who are trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

Although I will enjoy
watching her expose

Pemberton and Campbell for the

coattail-riding
frauds that they are.

That is Ellen's brand,
gotcha journalism.

Yeah, you should've
seen her take down

John Krasinski last week.

Got him to admit he loved his wife.
It was brutal.

All right, our next guests
are a couple of physicists...

don't turn the channel.

They've been doing
some viral videos online

about what it's like to be in
the running for a Nobel Prize.

Please welcome
Doctors Greg Pemberton

and Kevin Campbell.

Why does she even want
to have scientists on?

Uh, silly question.

Who else will give her audience

causal explanations of
natural phenomena?

I love you, honey, but think.

So you guys have
discovered something

pretty amazing in the universe.

Obviously, I understand, uh,
high-level physics

because I'm a comedian, but...

can you explain it
to the audience?

Well, I don't know, I'm not sure

we're even smart enough
to understand it.

Look, look, the audience
is laughing at them.

It's starting.

I hate to say it, Sheldon, but
I think the audience likes them.

Well, that will all change
when Ellen asks them

how super-asymmetry
explains the cosmological

excess of matter over
anti-matter and they panic,

like Leonard trying
to do a pull-up.

Hey, what'd I do?

Not a pull-up.

People have been loving your
videos, especially the...

the songs that
you've been posting.

-Oh, thanks.
-Thank you.

Uh, this may be pushing
it, but I have to ask.

Would you mind singing...

one of those for us right now?

-Oh, why not?
All right.

Come on, Ellen, they're right
there. Go for the jugular.

# Let's get physicist,
physicist #

# I want to get physicist

# Let's get into physicist

# Let me hear your boson talk

Come on, Ellen.

# Let me hear your boson talk... #

Dr. Pemberton.

Dr. Campbell.

Doctors Pemberton and Campbell.

Morning, buddy.

I am not your buddy.

What's wrong?

I'll tell you what's wrong.

You went on TV
and were charming.

Thanks, man.

That's what my mom said.

W... why don't you come
in and have some parfait?

Yeah, we ordered it
from room service;

it cost, like, 12 bucks.

It's just yogurt in a glass.

I don't want your yogurt.

Then what do you want?

I want you to hold
a press conference

where you admit that
you blindly stumbled

into super-asymmetry and it
was really our discovery.

Oh.

No, thanks.

You know, just because
we proved something

by accident doesn't
mean we didn't prove it.

Yeah, I wasn't trying
to prove that my wife

was cheating on me when I
came home early one Friday,

but I'm still sleeping
on his couch.

I told you, you can
do better than her.

Thanks.

It just hurts.

And when you win
that Nobel Prize,

she's gonna realize
that she was wrong.

You are not a fraud.

She is not wrong.

Wow, I can't believe
you're siding with Linda.

Shame on you.

Look at this. They
posted another video.

It's not even about science.

They're on a celebrity bus tour.

Those are fun.

I... I went on one

and saw Tom Hanks
talking to his gardener.

He's even nice when you plant
the wrong colour azaleas.

Those guys are good at
self-promoting, so what?

No one ever won a
Nobel for being nice.

Yeah, but if they did,
do you know who would win one?

Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?

He picked up a shovel
and helped the guy replant.

Dr. Cooper, there you are.

I just wanted to
tell you not to worry

about this Pemberton
and Campbell publicity blitz.

Are you worried?

Not at all.

Not even a little bit.

Look...

I... it doesn't matter
if they have popular support,

we're gonna get the scientific
community behind us.

He's right, the Nobel Prize
is about the work,

and as your fellow scientists,

we support you and Amy.

That's great, Scooby Gang.

Now...

the university is
gonna host a reception

for you and Dr. Fowler
where we invite as many

academic luminaries
as we can, uh,

give them a chance to meet
you, hear about your work.

Uh, that's a great idea.

Uh, yeah. Who needs to
be likeable when you have

Nobel Laureates
campaigning for you?

Oh, yeah... wait a minute.
Do you not think we're likeable?

That's what's great about you,

you never stop asking
the tough questions.

Hey.

Kids asleep?

Nope. I've been trying
to get them down for hours.

Apparently, Halley's afraid
of the dark now

and I can't turn
on the night-light

'cause it makes Michael cry.

Why doesn't he like
the night-light?

Jot that down, we can ask him
as soon as he learns to speak.

We can also find out what's
so damn funny about birds.

I'll go talk to her.

I don't know why she's suddenly
so afraid of everything.

Honey,

remember, she's my child, too.

Hey, sweetie,

I heard you were
afraid of the dark.

I know someone else
who was afraid of the dark once.

Your daddy, when
he was in space.

And just like you, I was
wearing a full diaper.

Hey, good news.

They're inviting several Nobel
Laureates to our reception.

Oh, great, like who?

Uh... Makoto Kobayashi.

Da... ooh.

What?

Well, I may have been
less than kind to him

about his Nobel Prize win.

Why?

I was jealous, angry
and new to Twitter.

It was a dangerous combination.

Okay, so scratch Kobayashi.

Uh, George Smoot's on here.

We have a history.

Saul Perlmutter?

Oh!

What about Kip Thorne?

That was a misunderstanding.

I didn't know he
was right behind me.

So you've alienated
everyone we need to help us?

Well, Amy, if I had known
that someday we'd need them,

I would never
have insulted them.

Well, that doesn't
make it better

.Oh.

Well, it's also not true.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Oh, that's cute.

Did Halley draw
that at preschool?

I drew it.

Well, good night.

It's supposed to be
an astronaut.

And I'm supposed to be living
on my own at this age, but...

here we are.

Halley was scared
and Howard told her

the sweetest story about
when he was in space and...

I thought I could turn it
into a book for her and Michael.

Oh, well, I mean,
I am an artist.

Uh, I... if you want,
I could do the drawings.

Really? That'd be amazing.

Yeah, it'd be fun.

And a... a nice change of pace
from what I usually draw.

What do you usually draw?

Well, good night.

Someone texting you?

Uh, no, I just met my
exercise goal for the day.

By doing the dishes?

Hey, you have your
goals, I have mine.

-Hello.
-What are you two doing?

Mm, just finishing a workout.

What's up?

Do you have any cookie dough?

Uh, I think so. Let me see.

Yeah, we've got,
uh, chocolate chip

and oatmeal raisin.

Oatmeal raisin?

I know at least two things
wrong with that cookie.

It's for the Nobel Laureates.

We need them on our side,
but unfortunately, Sheldon...

No. 'Unfortunately, Sheldon...'
that's all you got to say.

Well, that's... so you need
these people's support

and you're sending
them baked goods?

Yeah, they're pretty smart.

Don't you think they're gonna
realize it's just a bribe?

No, you'd think, but
sometimes brilliant people

can be painfully
oblivious to social cues.

Thank you for pointing
that out, Sheldon.

Anytime.

'Sheldon Cooper'? Hmm.

'Sheldon Cooper'?

Pass.

'Sheldon Cooper.' Aw.

Ugh, oatmeal raisin?

Ugh.

Oh, it's from Saul Perlmutter.

He sent me a picture.

Ooh, let me see.

Oh, he arranged the cookies
to spell out 'thank you.'

Sheldon, that word
isn't 'thank.'

Hi. I got you a surprise.

What... oh.
What's the occasion?

I heard you tell Halley
that story the other night,

and I thought it was so sweet

that Stuart and I
turned it into a book.

The Frightened Little Astronaut?

That looks just like you.

Look how tiny
and scared you look.

And the best part is...

Stuart showed it
to a publisher friend of his,

and they're interested in it.

That is so cool.

Absolutely not.

Why?

Because I don't want
the whole world to know

I was the frightened
little astronaut!

Maybe you should've called it
The Bitchy Little Astronaut.

You want to tell me
what's going on?

Is my distress that obvious?

Sheldon, please don't
take this the wrong way,

but when you're quiet
even for a second,

something's wrong.

Well, it's true.

The fact is, I feel
really bad for Amy.

Well, we all do.

But just for fun, why do you?

Well, she didn't
do anything wrong,

but she's paying
for my mistakes.

Wow.

What?

No... I'm just
honestly impressed.

When did you start caring
about other people's feelings?

Well, I laughed
when Amy got a shock

from the broken
Christmas tree lights,

so it was after that.

So none of them are
coming to the reception?

I don't think so.

Okay, what did he say
that was so insulting?

Well...

he may have suggested
there was an inelegance

to the quadrupole
normalization of Smoot's data.

Damn.

See, sometimes I wish I could
invent a time machine,

so I could go back
and prevent myself

from acting so rashly.

Or moving forward, you could

think before you speak.

I suppose so.

But the time machine thing
is probably more likely.

My problem is that
I don't always know

when I've gone too far.

Well, uh, if you like,
I could try to help you out.

You know, and maybe let you
know if you're crossing a line.

Oh, you mean, like,
with a code word?

Sure.

How's 'shut up'?

That's perfect. People
say it to me all the time,

no one will suspect.

Hey, got a minute?

Sure. What's up?

Uh, Bernadette said

you weren't crazy
about the book.

No.

It's great. I just don't
want anyone to ever see it

or read it or know it exists.

But this could be really
good for me, you know?

Finally get my
artwork published.

And... and come on,
it's a, it's a cute story.

Oh, easy for you to say.

No one's gonna think
you're a coward.

Are you kidding? The other
day in the comic book store,

a balloon popped and I threw up.

Can't you just...

take my name off it?

No, uh, the only reason
the publisher's interested

is 'cause a real
astronaut wrote it.

Well, look, what if
we made a few changes?

Uh, sure, yes.

What... what do
you have in mind?

Well, nothing major.

But see here on the
cover, where it says

'frightened little,' what if...

I don't know,
it didn't say that?

So...

it would just
be The Astronaut?

Yeah, you're right.

That doesn't quite pop.
What about...

The Brave Astronaut?

See, that's got some zip to it!

Okay.

And here on this...

page, where I'm crying.
What if, instead, I'm...

punching a meteor into the
sun with my bare fists?

So you have superpowers?

I like the way you're thinking.

Professor Thorne?

Dr. Hofstadter.

Uh, you know my wife, Penny.

-Sure.
-Hi. -Hi.

Uh, we wanted to talk
to you about Dr. Cooper.

Now, before you say no...

No.

Well, then, after you say no.

No.

Okay, look, Sheldon's
a pain in the ass.

But Dr. Fowler's
really nice.

So if you average them out...

math...

you got someone who's okay.

And the... then... but
more than the person,

the Nobel is about the work.

You should understand that
more than anyone.

Yes, because of your work
on gravitational waves.

You know my work?

I do. But I'm... I'm really
hogging this conversation.

Leonard?

Just give them a chance.

Uh, science has a history
of difficult people.

Look at, uh, Newton, who
was a jerk to Leibniz,

and Leibniz, who was
a jerk to everyone.

Yeah, you know, and I
don't need to tell you

that gravitational
waves are disturbances

in the curvature of space-time.

Or that the... hey, you worked
on the movie Interstellar?

So what do you think?

I think if you were in space
without a shirt on, you'd die.

Oh.

No, I am wearing a shirt.

It's just skin-tight,
so you can see my pecs.

When did you get pecs?

Yesterday, when I made
Stuart add them.

Howie, what I liked
about the other story

was that it was real.

I mean, nothing in this
actually happened to you.

So, it's a children's book.

I mean, cats don't wear hats.

And if someone gives you
green eggs, it ends

with you on the toilet trying
to make a deal with God.

But the real story was so sweet.

The little astronaut was afraid,

but he still went to space,
and that's what made him brave.

But in space,
the other astronauts...

made fun of him,
and that's a thing

he doesn't want to relive.

I get that.

I guess it would just
take a really brave man

to put an embarrassing story
like that out into the world,

just so it might help
some frightened children

not feel so alone.

Wow. That is
quite the guilt trip.

Are you sure you're not Jewish?

I'm just a wife that is
so proud of her husband,

and doesn't think
that he has anything

to be embarrassed about.

Oh.

You're sounding
less and less Jewish.

Hey, we just heard
that you're the ones

who convinced the Nobel
Laureates to come.

-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

You guys deserve this.

Yeah, now get out of here,
go talk to some smart people.

Wait a minute.

Yeah, sorry. Sometimes I forget

you're smart because
you're so sexy.

-I can see that.
-Yeah.

Dr. Cooper.
Dr. Fowler.

I was just telling Professor
Arnold how you came up

with super-asymmetry
at your wedding.

It's a wonderful story.

Ha, it really is.

I wouldn't say it was the
highlight of the wedding,

because I've been told not to

for reasons I don't
fully understand.

Uh, but what he does understand

is how the universe works,
and that's what's important.

Not what comes out of his mouth.

Uh-oh.

I haven't been to a lot of
parties like this,

but what does a physics
rumble look like?

-Kind of like angry chickens.
-Hmm.

Or... or... or... or like, uh,
when... when puppets fight.

Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler,
good to see you.

What are you doing here?

Professor Smoot invited us.

-We're Facebook friends.
-Smooty!

Well, this is our
reception, so...

go away.

Actually, Amy, I think
we should let them stay.

Please, enjoy yourselves.

Try some pigs in blankets.

And yes, that is the plural.

-Great.
-Thanks.

What are you doing?

If they stay, everyone
will see that their

grasp on super-asymmetry
is tenuous at best.

Oh. That's clever.

Yeah, I don't just know
the plurals of things, Amy.

Is this gonna be a problem?

Mm? No, no, no.
We have a plan.

Uh, Dr. Campbell
and Pemberton,

will you settle a bet for
Dr. Fowler and me?

We were just discussing,
under what conditions

the radiative corrections
to super-asymmetry

could cause time
variation of alpha E.M.?

I say active galactic nuclei
at cosmological distances

show a part per
million deviation.

Dr. Cooper says this has been

disproven recently with
quasar observations.

What do you think?

I agree with you.

Good answer.

Hey, uh, if we haven't
said it before, we just...

want to say...

thank you.

Yeah. We couldn't have proven
super-asymmetry without you.

Wait... wait. You all
heard them say it.

They didn't do anything.

Sheldon. Shut up.

Yeah... well, that's rude.

No.

Shut up.

Oh, the code word, thank you.

You know, it's strange.
A few months ago,

nobody paid any attention to us,
and now all of a sudden,

we're getting all
these accolades.

Yeah, have... have any
of you ever felt like

maybe you didn't deserve it?

Leonard, there's
something I need to say.

-Shut up.
-Okay.

It's crazy.

We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

and yet somehow we,

we still feel like imposters.

There should be a term for that.

Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

It's called 'imposter syndrome'

and you don't have it!

Because you can't have it
if you are imposters,

and you are!

We're the ones

who discovered super-asymmetry!

So if anyone's gonna feel like

they have imposter syndrome,

it's us, because
we're not imposters!

They are!

You're imposters
and you're frauds!

Is that what I
would've sounded like?

-Yeah.
-Yikes!

'Once upon a time,
there was a little astronaut

who was sitting in a rocket
waiting to go to space.'

Three... two... one...

And while all
the other astronauts

laughed and joked,
he stayed quiet,

because he had a secret.

He was scared.

He had another secret, too.

He was only pretending to be
scared to trick the alien king.

Ha-ha!

Howie.

Fine.

There was no alien.

There was a bossy wife, though.
We'll get to her later.

We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

and yet somehow we...

we still feel like imposters.

Yeah, there should
be a term for that.

Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

It's called 'imposter syndrome,'

and you don't have it,
because you can't have it

if you are imposters,
and you are!

We're the ones who
discovered super-asymmetry,

so if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,

it's us, because
we're not imposters.

They are!

You're imposters
and you're frauds!

Is that what I
would've sounded like?

-Yeah.
-Yikes.

Sheldon, look at this.

Wait a minute.

How do I know this isn't
one of those joke phones

that squirts water in my face?

Because that's not even a thing.
Look.

You got called into
human resources?

I'm sure it's because I insulted
Pemberton and Campbell

in a room full
of Nobel Laureates.

You did do that.

It was awkward. People
didn't know where to look.

This is a twist.

Usually you're the one
getting called into H.R.

Yeah, now it's Amy.

Who knew you were married
to such a bad girl.

I suppose the signs
were always there.

I mean, she did recently
go to that rave at the mall.

It was a Spencer's Gifts.

There was music
and a strobe light.

If that isn't a rave, then
I don't know what one is.

You don't know what one is.

Guys, come on,
I think I'm in trouble.

It's no big deal. I used
to get called into H.R.

all the time.
Ms. Davis is great.

Pro tip: If you find
strong women sexy,

do not say it out loud.

Oh! She wants to see me, too.

All right, let's get
our story straight:

This is all your fault.

Relax.

You're probably just gonna
get a slap on the wrist.

Maybe, but do not ask for that,
on the wrist or anywhere else.

Thank you both for coming.

President Siebert asked that
I be a part of this conversation

to help us calmly discuss

what went wrong and how we
can better move forward.

We are not here
to point fingers,

so, Dr. Cooper,
please stop that.

President Siebert,
would you like to start?

This is all my fault.

I assumed you knew
the Nobel Prize was good

and we wanted to win it,

so that's on me.

-Oh, so...
-No.

I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that

this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

Like maybe you two
keep your traps shut.

'Traps.' That's a fun old word.
Where's that been?

I... I'm sorry.
I... I just... I... I snapped.

Oh, you're sorry!
It's all better then!

Listen up, you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

and you're blowing it.

I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize

and you're blowing it.

Uh, that's exactly what he said.

Yes, but I said it
in my calming H.R. voice.

The science world is
a small community. People talk.

I'm sure by now everyone
knows about your tantrum.

All right, well, what can we do?

Nothing.

Let me make this
absolutely clear for you.

You two are done talking.

We're cancelling your
speaking engagements

and your interviews.

You're gonna lie low and
let us do damage control.

Well, if that's what you
want, that's what we'll do.

You two winning the Nobel
Prize is very important to us,

and not just to the university.

Dr. Fowler, you would be
only the fourth woman

to win a Nobel Prize in physics.

I don't need to tell you

just how inspirational
that would be

to a generation of young women.

Uh, yes, of... of
course, I know.

So, the next words
out of your mouth

should be on a stage in
Stockholm when you're saying...

which is Swedish for,
'Thank you for this honour.'

which is Swedish for,
'I knew that.'

Dr. Cooper...

-You want me to shut my trap?
-I do.

Hey, check it out.

That looks like the moped
you used to have.

It wasn't a moped.
It was a scooter.

How's that better?

You do not want to walk
into a scooter bar

and ask that question.

Well, does take me back.

Yeah, the two of us,

cruising around town
looking for women.

Looking and looking and looking.

Remember that time
one looked back and said hi?

Oh, yeah.

We drove away so fast.

Hey, I forget,
why did you sell the scooter?

I finally got my woman.

Then my woman made me sell it.

So apparently, if we win,

I'll be the fourth woman ever
to win a Nobel in physics.

Wow, that's a big deal.

Huh!. Tell me about it.

This morning, I blew through my
antiperspirant in, like, an hour.

Plus, Sheldon's freaking out
'cause we got in trouble.

Well, I've got him
distracted for a while.

Doesn't he know
how to solve those?

Normally, yes, but I switched
the stickers around, so...

I don't even think
it's possible to solve...

Solved it.

What? No, you didn't.

Not the cube, but the puzzle of
why I couldn't solve the cube.

Solution: You switched stickers
two, nine, 32, and 51.

Really? This thing has numbers?

Anything has a number
if you assign it a number,

friend number four.

Top five, not bad.

This is so frustrating.

I can't believe the
university expects us

to just sit back and do nothing.

Sweetie, you just need to relax.

You know what I like to do?

Numb your brain with alcohol
and watch a reality show

where wealthy people pick
fake arguments with each other?

Hey, don't knock it
until you've wasted

a couple hundred hours
of your life.

I'm sorry, but this is,
it's hard for me.

Usually I self-soothe
by doing science,

but now science reminds
me of the Nobel Prize

and the idea that
we may not win one,

and that makes me
angry, which makes me

want to self-soothe by doing
science, and on and on and on.

So that's been my today.

Hey, how about a massage?

No, the only person who
touches me is my wife.

And even I have to let
him smell my hand first.

Okay, well, what about Reiki?

It's like massage
but without touching.

Then what is it?

Well, I place my hands
near your body

and allow the
universal energy field

to manifest its healing powers.

Okay, I know

it sounds crazy, but it
really works; ask Leonard.

-It really does.
-Yeah.

No.

Oh, uh, how about a
sensory deprivation tank?

Oh, that's interesting.

It's supposed to be
very calming.

Floating in a warm
pool of liquid

in a dark, soundless space.

Oh, I don't know
how I feel about

being deprived of all my senses.

What are you talking about?
All you ever do is complain

about how things
smell, feel and sound.

Oh, I'm right here.
Why are you shouting?

What do you say?

We could both use a break.

Come on, I'll do it with you.

Okay, but not in the same tank.

I already shared a uterus
with my twin sister.

I don't need to go
through that again.

Are your eyes closed?

Yes. What is it? Show me.

Okay, open them.

You bought me a scooter?

No, I bought me a scooter!

Then why did you make
me close my eyes?

I wanted to see the
expression on your face

when you saw how happy I was.

Wait, one second.

Won't Bernadette be mad
when she finds out?

She's not gonna. I'm keeping
it here at the university.

Ah.

My dad kept a secret
at work, too, but...

it was his receptionist.

Hey, would you mind
if I ride it sometimes?

Yeah, whenever you want.

Check it out.

That there, son, is 12 horses
of 'eye-talian' thunder.

Have either of you done
sensory deprivation before?

-No.
-Never.

Okay, just a heads up.

People have different
experiences in the tanks.

Uh, some people
experience perfect calm.

Some people sleep.

Some people even reported
having visions.

But if at any time
you feel uncomfortable,

just press the panic button
and say, 'Bebe.'

That's a stupid word.

That's my name.

What do we push if
we feel uncomfortable?

All right, are you ready?

I'm not saying
this is why we came,

but can I close the lid on him?

No.

No.

Shall we?

One second.

-Is the pH between 7.2 and 7.8?
--Yes.

Is the water drained
and replaced after each use?

Yes.

-Is the saline level 30%?
-Yes.

Does your filtration system
use ultraviolet light

-to kill bacteria?
-Yes.

I don't need to get in.
I'm relaxed already.

Bebe.

What's wrong?

Nothing. I just wanted
to make sure it worked.

Also, I changed my mind.

It's fun to say your name.

Bebe. Bebe.

Bebe. Bebe.

Bebe. Bebe.

Hey, what you got there?

Oh.

Just...

tossing out this old
helmet I don't need.

I thought you were at the park.

We were. The kids got sleepy.

Great story. I need
to make a phone call.

Howard, why do you
look all guilty?

Like when I catch you
deleting your browser history?

Never mind.

Hmm...

this is nice.

It's sort of like
floating in space.

But better because
my eyeballs haven't frozen.

Ooh, colours.

It's infinite iterations

of the 'Nautilus' section
of the Mandelbrot set.

That's some good stuff.

Wow...

this is really dark.

There's no difference between
my eyes being open or closed.

Open, closed.

Open, clo... nope, same thing.

Ooh, pretty.

You winning a Nobel Prize would
be an inspiration to all women.

All women, Amy,
and you're blowing it.

I was gonna be a scientist,

but since you lost,

I'm just gonna give make-up
tutorials on YouTube.

Look all the infinite
Mandelbrot sets.

Here a brot, there a brot,
everywhere a Mandelbrot.

Thanks for letting us down.

I'm gonna marry a dope
and have his dopey children.

-You're such a disappointment.
-I can't do science.

-Way to not go, girl.
-Disappointing.

-Math is too hard.
-I am woman, hear me bake.

-Disappointment.
-You're letting us down.

-You're letting us down.
-You're blowing it.

-Disappointment.
-You're blowing it.

Mm, mm, mm.

Okay, hour's up.
Let's see how they're doing.

Hey, buddy, how you feeling?

Aw. Five more minutes?

Hey, Amy. Relaxed?

I'm a failure! I can't do this!

Can someone close her lid?

She's kind of
harshing my mellow.

That tank was amazing.

It was like Disneyland,

but the rides were
in 35 dimensions.

And instead of Mickey,
I had my picture taken

with the concept
that time is an illusion.

That's great.
I'm so happy for you.

Uh, yeah, a little
constructive criticism:

You're saying you're happy,

but you're using
your mean voice.

Thanks for pointing that out.

Now you got it.

Sheldon, I'm freaking out.

Well, is this still
about the Nobel Prize?

Yes, it's about the Nobel Prize!

And back to the mean voice.

It's just... it's
too much pressure.

You know? It was bad enough
when I was letting us down.

But now, if I don't win, it's
like I'm letting all women down.

Hang on.

What... what are you doing?

I'm googling what to do
when someone's freaking out.

Huh.

Uh, whoa, it says here
that a walk can be calming.

Bye.

Hey.

You still mad?

Are you still a jackass?

Now, now, I asked you first.

I can't believe you were

sneaking around my back
like a child.

I just didn't want you to worry.

No, you just didn't
want to get caught.

I'm sorry, but you
telling me what I can

and can't do is pretty
damn emasculating.

Emasculating?

You were about to ride bitch
on a moped with another man.

It's a scooter.

It can go on some highways.

What if you fell?

What if you got hurt?

I don't want to raise
two small children

and one large vegetable.

I'm sorry, but I need to have...

something in my life that
reminds me I'm still a man.

You do.

You have a wife and two
children who need their father.

I know that.

Uh, well, you don't act like it.

Why do you want to ride
that stupid thing anyway?

I don't know.

Maybe I...

just miss the freedom
I had as a younger man.

What freedom?
You lived with your mother.

You had a curfew.

It wasn't a curfew;

it was just a time
of night where if I

got home after that,
she would be mad.

You know what?
I'm done talking about this.

-Do whatever you want.
-I will!

I just want you to ask
yourself if that tiny,

ridiculous scooter is the
hill you want to die on.

Oh, yeah, this feels good.

Born to ride, buddy.

Yeah, watch out, ladies.

All right, well, wish me luck.

You won't need luck.

Yeah, only condoms.

He sees that car, right?

I tried to console her,
but nothing seemed to work.

Okay, when you say
you consoled her,

what exactly does that mean?

I took a walk, I came back,

she was still upset,
so I came here.

Well, I don't see what
else you could've done.

You know, I know she's unhappy,

but I don't know how to help.

Maybe you can't.

Sometimes people are upset,

and all you can do
is be there for them.

And while I'm there,
what do I do?

Nothing.

Oh, so like what you're
doing right now to help me.

You're up.

Sheldon, maybe you
don't know what to do

because Amy's always
taking care of you.

Of course.

And by calming down,
I've taken away

the one thing that gives
her comfort: caring for me.

That's what you heard?

Yes.

No, I need to have
an emotional meltdown

so she's forced to focus on me

and forget about herself.

No. Th... that's not
even close to what...

Uh, you know, actually, that
might be your best move.

Yeah.

Amy. Thank goodness you're home.

I don't know if you can
tell, but I am literally

losing my mind.

You are?

Isn't it obvious? I just used
'literally' figuratively.

Like a crazy person.

What is going on with you?
Are you okay?

No, I am not okay, so I
suggest you start focusing

on me to the exclusion
of your own feelings.

Sheldon, whatever you're doing,

I... I don't have time
for it right now.

I'm sorry. I know you're upset,

but I don't know
how to make it better.

I don't know how
you can, either.

I mean, I don't know if anybody can.
I just...

I feel like I'm letting
everybody down.

I'm about to hold you.

Would you like to
smell my hand first?

I'm fine.

Thank you.

# Soft kitty, warm kitty

# Little ball of fur

# Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

# Purr, purr, purr

That helps.

-Shh, I'm singing.
-Oh.

# Soft kitty, warm kitty

# Little ball of fur...

Raj said you got $800.

Jerk.

On a positive note, the scooter
helped Bert meet a girl.

Oh, that's nice.
What does she do?

She's an E.R. nurse.

Oh, no.

No. It was a real meet-cute.

She popped his arm back
in the socket, and...

when he came to, they
exchanged phone numbers.

Aw.

Ms. Davis?

Dr. Fowler, how can I help you?

You were right

about this Nobel Prize
being bigger than I am,

and you were right

that, like it or not,
I am a role model.

But you are wrong to
keep me on the sidelines.

I am smart,

I'm capable, and I
can make a difference.

Well said. You
make a strong case.

Damn right, 'cause
I'm a strong woman

wearing a strong
man's deodorant!

Well, how about have a seat?

Maybe you'd like
a glass of water?

You have anything with
a little more kick?

Seriously, Dr. Fowler,

this is human resources.

You're right. I... I don't
know what I was thinking.

You want ice,
you're out of luck.

Oh, the... there's
a 7:15 at the ArcLight.

Well, that doesn't give
us much time to eat.

We can eat afterwards.

I'm not gonna eat
at 10:00 at night.

Who am I, Hemingway?

Why do you think
Hemingway ate at 10:00?

He spent a lot of time in
Spain. They eat dinner late.

He also spent a lot
of time in Florida.

Last time I was there,
people were eating dinner

at, like, 4:30.

You guys know that Hemingway
had cats with six toes?

Six toes per foot
or six toes total?

Okay.

It's official. We're never
going to see the Avengers.

Guys, just come on.
Make a decision.

I... I'm good with eating after.

-Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.
-Yeah, me, too.

Then we'll eat before.

Okay. So, then, we can
see the 3-D at 9:00

or the 2-D at 9:30.

3-D. If I'm gonna see Thor,

I want to feel like
I could lick those abs.

Actually, 3-D kind
of makes me queasy.

No, but we have
to see it in 3-D.

We saw part one in 3-D,
and the 2-D part two

is not the part two
of the 3-D part one.

He's got you there, Leonard.

Or he doesn't. I don't
really care anymore.

Okay, then, we'll
go see it in 3-D.

No. Sweetie, you
shouldn't do things

that make you feel bad.

Well, I'm doing this.

And of course he is.

He is a textbook satisficer.

That's not even a word.

Uh, yes, it is.

According to Nobel Prize-winning
economist Herbert Simon,

satisficing is a
decision-making strategy

whereby a person accepts

whatever available
option is satisfactory

rather than seeking out
a course of action

that would make him happiest,

as I just did when I explained
what satisficing was.

He's right.

No one wanted to hear that.

He knew it, yet he ploughed ahead.

I'm just trying to find a plan
that makes everyone happy.

Except you.

Yeah, Leonard.
What would make you happy?

I could tell you about
satisficing again.

You know, what
would make me happy

is if we just stop
talking about this

and see whatever movie
you guys want to see

whenever you want to see it.

Okay. But next time,
we get to pick.

How's your headache?

It's better.

The throwing up really helped.

Mm. I'm so sorry you missed
the end of the movie.

Oh, it's okay.

Everyone talked about it
so much on the ride home,

I feel like I saw it.

Well, to be fair, you talked
about the bathroom so much,

we felt like we saw that, too.

I think I would've been okay

if we weren't sitting so close.

Well, then, why did
we sit so close?

Sheldon said, 'Are these seats
good for everyone?'

What was I supposed to do,
say no, like a maniac?

Sweetie, you have got to
stand up for yourself.

You know, maybe Sheldon's right.

Maybe you are that word he said.

Satisficer?

Yeah, that!
That's the one.

Boy, sounds way more
made-up when you say it.

I mean, come on,
when was the last time

you did something
totally selfish without worrying

about what anyone else wanted?

Uh... according to my mother,

I took my sweet time being born.

How is that selfish?

Apparently, she had
dinner reservations.

And this is the telescope room

where I spend a lot
of my evenings.

Where's the telescope?

Hawaii.

That's cool.

Yeah, so, you know...

aloha.

What's that smell?

Uh, everyone has
their own theory.

Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mould.

I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.

So, what am I looking at?

Ah, this is live information
from the Keck telescope.

It's pretty interesting. So...

I recently observed
some optical flashes.

It could be light bouncing
off a natural object,

but those tend to be
less reflective, so...

could be evidence of
something alien-made.

Oh, this suddenly got exciting.

Oh. When you say 'exciting,'

do you mean 'go back
to my place' exciting

or 'hold our breath
and do it here'?

Mahalo.

Do I want to ask?

Oh, w... when I go upstairs,

Penny's gonna make me choose
what we're gonna do tonight

without taking her feelings
into consideration,

and I... I don't know
if I'm up for it.

Poor baby.

When I go upstairs,

Sheldon's gonna give
me a 25-minute lecture

about what Hulk would be like
if he were made of metal.

Part of his ongoing series,

'What If Hulk Were Made
of Other Things?'

I... I've always been
a people pleaser.

Is that so bad?
It's gotten me this far.

What, almost up four
flights of stairs?

Okay, if I go in there and
pick something I want to do

that she also wants to
do, she's gonna think

I'm just picking it
to make her happy.

So...

I feel like I have to
pick something I know

she doesn't want to do or
she's gonna be disappointed.

Right?
What do you think?

Think I've got ice cream in this
bag that's starting to melt.

I'm sorry.

It's exhausting
being in my head.

Look,

when you wanted Penny,

you didn't care what anybody
else thought or wanted,

including Penny.

That's true.

Yeah, yeah, there was
something I wanted,

I went after it and I got it.

Now you're hiding from it on the
stairs, so it all worked out.

Hey. I thought about what
I want to do tonight,

and I didn't take your feelings
into consideration at all.

Great.

I want to have sex.

Wow, sex with your wife.

You're really swinging for
the fences there, Hofstadter.

Yeah, we don't have to.

No!

I like it.
Let's go.

Oh, o... okay.

And then after that, we're
gonna watch Star Trek Discovery.

All right. Well, just a warning,

I might be on my
phone for most of it.

That's fine.

Wait, you mean
just the Star Trek...

Actually, I don't care.

And, with apologies
to Lady Gaga,

that's how a star is born.

Told you he was
gonna mention Lady Gaga.

At least he didn't
talk about how much

he cried during that movie.

Although, if you haven't
seen that movie, you should.

I cried so much.

Well, that's the lecture
for today.

Uh, let's open it up
for questions.

Uh...

Oh, you! Sir, yes.

You have a question?

Yeah. Actually, I have
a two-part question.

Are you sure? I get the
sense it's only one part.

No, no, it's two.

Part one:

The new star you
were talking about...

how long did it take that
light to reach Earth?

And part two:

is it true you plant
your friends in the audience

to ask questions?

46,000 years.

And no,
I don't plant my friends,

because apparently,
I don't have any.

Uh, any other questions?

Uh, yes. You, miss.

Hi. I read your paper
on specular reflections.

It was great.

Oh, thank you so much.

In your conclusion, you
said you couldn't rule out

that light flashes could be
evidence of alien civilization.

So does that mean
you think it's aliens?

I was just illustrating that
there are many unknowns,

and as scientists, we can't
pre-emptively rule out possibilities.

So you think it's aliens.

A... actually, no, that's...

I have a question about
the aliens you found.

That's not what I said, Howard.

Hold on a second.

Do you two know each other?

Yeah. My sister was...

a... and this is her term...
abducted.

Do you think those could be
the same aliens...

Okay, any other questions?

Not about aliens?

What?

Do you still want me to
ask the one you gave me?

'Cause it kind of feels
like we're past that.

Ooh, Leonard,
I don't mean to alarm you,

but the Chinese food
smells funny.

That's because it's barbecue.

But it's Chinese food night.

Um, I picked it. You're
the one who told me

to stop being such a
satisficer all the time.

What?
I did not.

I just pointed out
that you were one.

It's what I like best about you.

Well, that and those little
notes you leave in my lunch.

I leave those!

Well, that's disappointing.

I already know
that you heart me.

Now I don't know
if Leonard does.

Well, this is what
we're having for dinner.

You can eat it or not.
I don't care.

I guess that answers
the heart question.

I... it's fine.
We'll have barbecue.

Oh, of course.
I'm nothing if not flexible.

I'm sure that at some point

in the 3,000-year history
of the Chinese empire,

a cavalryman crossing
the Gobi Desert

was forced by hunger
to eat his own horse

and roast it over
a camp-fire, hence,

Chinese barbecue. Let's eat.

Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't
watch the news today.

Has the whole world gone mad?

It's my house.

I'm tired of being told
where I can and can't sit.

You did this.

Amy, grab your meat.
We're leaving in a huff.

I'm sorry, if I don't
go now, it's not a huff.

Don't take this the wrong way,

but that was even more
exciting than the sex.

Don't take this the wrong
way, but yes, it was.

Leonard, where are you going?

Well, to work.

Just trying out
a different route.

Okay.

If we cross the county line,
it's technically kidnapping.

Well, if you don't approve
of my driving, too bad.

This is the new me.
Get used to it.

Fine.

Then this is the new me,

and he finds the
new you tiresome.

How is that different
than the old you?

The new me gives knowing winks.

Well, all these years,

I... I was afraid to say
what I wanted.

You know, even at work,

you know, there's things
I want to accomplish,

but I didn't want to
ruffle any feathers

or step on any toes.

Feathers and toes?
Is the new thing you're trying

to accomplish ballroom
dancing with a chicken?

Look at that...
the new me is hilarious.

Always wanted to be
the principal investigator

on a plasma physics study.

Hey, look at that...
the new you's funny, too.

I'm serious.
You know...

I'm gonna put together a proposal
and tell President Siebert

this is what I want to do.
If he doesn't let me,

there's plenty of other
universities that will.

Sure there are.

Of course you don't
want me to do that,

because you like it when
you're successful and I'm not.

No, you're confusing
causation and...

'Welcome to Alhambra.'
Where the heck are we?

Now I'm some sort of big joke.

I'm even on some
alien conspiracy blog.

See? 'Caltech
astrophysicist'

finds proof of alien life.'

Wow, that is not
a great picture of you.

That's not the point.

Dr. Koothrappali.

I'm surprised to
see you in here.

Why is that?

Because the truth...

is out there!

You see?

That's what I'm talking about.

People have been doing
that to me all day.

Relax. They're just having fun.

Oh, come on!

See? It's fun.

Wow. Deja vu.

Amy, you're a neuroscientist...

you know the latest research
into deja vu suggests

it's nothing but the
frontal regions of the brain

attempting to correct
an inaccurate memory.

You telling me stuff
I already know

is definitely deja vu.

How about telling me
something I don't know,

like why you're
sitting on the stairs.

How can I tell if
I'm doing something

for a noble reason
or a selfish reason?

Try saying the thing
in your head

and see if you can add
the words, 'That'll show 'em.'

Leonard's about to demand a job

that I don't think the
university will give him.

I'm worried he's making
a giant mistake.

But maybe I only
think that because

deep down I don't
want him to succeed.

The fact that you're worried
about your motivation

supports the idea that you
genuinely care for your friend.

I do.

Thank you, Amy.

You know what?

After I've talked to Leonard,

you've earned yourself a
bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.

That'll show me.

So, I spent the whole day
putting together this proposal,

and tomorrow I'm gonna
tell President Siebert

that this is what I want to do.

Oh. Well, this...

looks great.

You didn't even open it.

Well, no, it's got
a nice, you know,

science-y heft to it. I...

Really proud of you, sweetie.

Leonard?

Um,

I have been agonizing
over whether

or not to say something to you.

Aw. Let me help. Don't.

I have to.

I don't think that
you should demand

to be in charge of
a plasma project.

Well, big surprise.

You can't stand the idea
of me succeeding.

No. I'll be honest.

New assertive Leonard is going

to take some getting used to.

But so did cargo
pants Leonard, hmm?

Who, for the record, I miss.

He always had gum.

Sheldon, if this is what he
wants, he should ask for it.

I mean, what's the worst
that happens? They say no.

Well, I'm not gonna
let them say no.

If they don't want me to quit,
this is what it's gonna take.

Wait, you're gonna quit?

Yeah. It's like you said,
I have to go after what I want,

and if I can't get
that at Caltech,

there are plenty of other
universities in the world.

W... in the world?

I can't even get you
to go to the beach,

and now you want to
move to the world?

Well, I don't want to, but if
that's what I have to do...

Okay, don't you think
threatening to quit your job

is something you
should run by me first?

You said I shouldn't
worry about your feelings.

I meant feelings about things
that I don't care about!

Now, I'm not quite sure
when to jump in here...

-Not now.
-Okay.

Fine, you want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

I... I'm not loving
my job right now.

And this is something
that would make me happy.

Don't you want me to be happy?

Oh, I've been dinged
on this before.

Whatever you really think,
you have to say yes.

Of course I want
you to be happy.

Well played.

Okay, I know this seems scary,

but I put together
a strong proposal.

It's good for me,
it's good for the university.

They're gonna give it to me.

No.

I'm sorry, President Siebert,

but I'm not taking
no for an answer.

I speak a little Russian.

Will you take nyet
for an answer?

I'm serious.

Oh. Well, that
changes everything.

-Really?
-Nyet.

I know a lot of people
have been having fun

claiming that I said
I found alien life.

I want to make it clear

that is not what I said.

I did say that was
one possible explanation.

I don't think that's
something to mock.

Right?

It would be arrogant
for us to assume

that we are alone
in the universe.

And as scientists,

we need to remain open
to the possibility

that the truth may sound silly

or far-fetched.

Uh, the round Earth.

Germs that cause diseases.

Subatomic particles.

All these at one time
seemed fanciful.

So who's to say what
science fiction of today

will be the reality of tomorrow?

Will there be colonies on Mars?

Uh, matter transporters?

Perhaps the Loch
Ness Monster is real.

Who knows?
I'm just saying that...

the only way
science moves forward

is to follow the evidence
wherever it leads,

even if it makes us
sound crazy sometimes.

Hey, Bernie, look at this.

'Caltech astrophysicist claims

Loch Ness Monster is real.'

Hey. How did it go? Great.

What, so you got the job?

I did not.

So you quit?
Okay, Leonard, I can't move.

I just bought a six-month
membership to SoulCycle.

Well, I... I didn't quit.

I said I was going to.

I walked out the door
and started crying.

You know, 'Oh, my,
God, oh, my God,

oh, my God, what'd I do?'

And then he called me back in.

Then he changed his mind?

He did not.

I'm really confused about
how to react to this story.

President Siebert
didn't want to lose me.

Even though they
couldn't make me

a lead investigator
on a plasma team,

there was an opening
for a co-lead

on a photon entanglement team.

How cool is that?

You're gonna have to tell me.

It's really cool.

Yay! Oh, I am so
happy for you.

I almost got what I wanted,

and it never would have happened

if you hadn't almost
believed in me.

Oh.

Let's celebrate.
What do you want to do?

Oh, please don't make me
decide another thing.

Hey, you want to go
to SoulCycle with me?

Give me a minute,
I'll think of something.

Now, I know what
you're thinking:

isn't Broccoli Hulk basically
just the Jolly Green Giant?

That is what I was thinking.

Let's never discuss it again.

Really?

Are you hiding from Penny again?

No. No, no, no.

I... I went to
SoulCycle with her,

and my legs hurt so bad, I...

literally can't stand up.

Sheldon, why don't you
keep him company.

All right.

Hello, Leonard.

Hey.

Have you ever wondered

what the Hulk would be like
if he were made of sherbet?

I give up.

Delicious.

We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

and yet somehow we...

we still feel like imposters.

Yeah, there should be
a term for that.

Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

It's called 'imposter syndrome,'

and you don't have it,
because you can't have it

if you are imposters,
and you are!

We're the ones who discovered
super-asymmetry,

so if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,

it's us because
we're not imposters,

they are!

You're imposters
and you're frauds!

I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that

this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

I... I'm sorry.
I... I just... I... I snapped.

Oh, you're sorry.
It's all better, then.

Listen up, you have shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

and you're blowing it.

I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

and you're blowing it.

Uh, that's exactly what he said.

Yes, but I said it
in my calming HR voice.

So, obviously,

I'm really sorry
about my outburst.

Calling you frauds
was unacceptable.

I feel terrible about it.

It has caused her
a lot of stress.

She chewed through
her night guard

like it was a piece of jerky.

What you said was
really hurtful,

especially because I
thought we were friends.

Why would you think that?

Ouch.

Ignore them;
they're just mean people.

Uh, not mean, just sorry.

Seem mean, are sorry.
Happens all the time.

It's okay. I talked
to my therapist,

and she made me realize
that what you said was...

really more about
your own insecurities.

I'm sorry, what?

There you go, she's sorry.
We all heard it. Moving on.

Yes, obviously,

you're angry at all
the attention we're getting

for our discovery
and you're lashing out.

Well, uh, technically,
she lashed out.

I contained myself,
which I don't think

I'm getting enough credit for.

The point is we should
take it as a compliment

that even you guys think
we will win the Nobel Prize.

Uh, no, we... we certainly
do not think that.

The Nobel Committee will realize

that we came up
with this theory.

But we proved it.

By accident.

All breakthroughs
happen by accident.

No, they don't!

Look, the Nobel Committee
doesn't like infighting,

so if the four of you don't
stop sniping at each other,

the award's gonna go
to someone else entirely.

He's right.

You know, like it or not,
we can't avoid each other.

Let's at least try to be civil.

Agreed.

You know, when you
think about it,

we're linked together the
same way that super-asymmetry

links together every
atom in the universe.

That's not what it does at all!

Well, that's the great
thing about science.

We all get to have
our own opinions.

I'm still not talking.
That's impressive, right?

You... no, no, no, no.
Your money's no good here.

Well,

I'm glad that we
hashed all that out,

and moving forward,

may the best team win.

I couldn't agree more.

We're the best team.

Greg Pemberton,
you old so-and-so.

Very good to see you.

Uh, let me introduce you
to my colleague, Dr. Campbell.

Uh, Kevin, this is Barry Kripke.
We went to college together.

Great to meet you.
Well, you have my number.

We should hit up the
buffet at the strip club

while you're in town.

Nothing beats a lap dance
and a baked potato bar, huh?

You can come, too.

That's a hard pass.

I'll walk you out.

Good to see you, Barry.

You're the best!

Oh...

God, I hate that guy.

That's strange; you
seem quite fond of him.

I was only being polite.
Pemberton is a grade A weasel.

How do I know you're
not just being polite

when you say it's
nice to see me?

I have literally
never said that to you.

Why do you say he's a weasel?

Pemberton's whole M.O.

was to take other people's ideas
and turn them in as his own.

That's exactly what
he's doing to us.

I'm not surprised.

I heard the only work he did
on his thesis was googling,

'Where can I buy a thesis?'

Well, plagiarism is a pretty
serious charge. Are you sure?

You want proof?
I can make some calls.

You'd do that for us?

I really don't want to see
that guy win a Nobel.

I also don't want
to see you win a Nobel.

Ooh, this is tricky.

I don't know, Barry.
It sounds a little sleazy.

Well,

let me know if you
change your mind.

Sleazy is where I thrive.

So I was talking to my mom

about our Pemberton
and Campbell situation.

Really? What'd she say?

Apparently, Old Testament God
would bring down his wrath

on them for being deceitful,

but New Testament God
would forgive them.

So couldn't we just
bring down our wrath

and ask the New Testament
God to forgive us?

You know, I asked her
that very question.

And?

She said I was full
of California sass.

Oh, good, you're all here.
Uh, we're wrestling

with an ethical question,
and perhaps you could help.

Sure, what's up?
-Yeah. -Fire away.

If we have damaging
and embarrassing

information about someone,

should we keep it to
ourselves or expose them?

Good question.

Does it happen
to do with online tastes

that might or might not reflect
their real-life tastes?

I know all about your
tall girl website.

It goes on our credit card.

It's Dr. Pemberton.

Kripke says he
plagiarized his thesis,

and that he can prove it.

Wow.

Well, that's not gonna sit
well with the Nobel Committee.

Hang on. I don't think
it's fair to use something

someone did in
school against them.

Relax, he said it's not you.

I don't know.
If someone's a cheater,

they should be held accountable

no matter how long ago it was.

Okay, now you just sound crazy.

So you really think
they should do this?

It wouldn't just knock Pemberton
out of Nobel contention,

it would blow up
his whole career.

To that, I say kaboom!

No, I meant it's a bad thing.

No, no, I agree with Bernadette.

If Pemberton cheated,

maybe he shouldn't have a
career in the first place.

There's plenty of people
that didn't plagiarize.

And a few of us who did,
but it's only 'cause

The Scarlet Letter
was so boring.

Aw, I love The Scarlet Letter.

Th... that's where I got
my taste for bad girls.

Ugh,

why is this decision so hard?

Maybe because you want to win,

but deep down you know it's not

the honourable way to do it.

Otherwise, you would've
done it already.

That's really wise.

Yes, but it may just be
the Indian accent.

Do you think by not
exposing Pemberton

we're doing the right thing?

Of course.

Unless...

you think we're not
doing the right thing.

Why would you think
that I don't think

we're doing the right thing?

You might think that if...

good people hold themselves

to unrealistically high
ethical standards, then...

they might lose out to their
unscrupulous competitors.

Is that what you think?

No.

No, I just thought
if you thought we weren't

doing the right thing,
that's why you might think that.

Well, if I did think that,

you might point out
that people who claim

it's okay to do
bad things to win

are bad people no matter
what they tell themselves.

And I'd be right
to point that out.

Because you're a good person.

I love talking to you.

It's like talking to me,
but with a girl voice.

I'm just saying, Sheldon
and Amy deserve to win,

and sometimes that means
doing what you got to do.

Don't you think it's better
to take the high road?

Yeah, and instead of guns,

armies should carry candy
canes that shoot wishes.

So what's the worst thing
you've ever done

to get something you wanted?

I'm not gonna tell you that.

Oh, come on.
I'll tell you mine.

Right, 'cause yours is gonna be

as bad as mine. Okay.

Come on, just tell me.

Okay, fine.

When we first met,
there was another waitress

at The Cheesecake Factory
who thought you were cute,

so I told her you had all
the hepatitises, A through Z.

There aren't 26 hepatitises.

Well, if she was smart
enough to know that,

she wouldn't still be working
at a Cheesecake Factory.

Oh, she still works there?
Who was it?

Why does it matter?

You're right, it doesn't...

matter 'cause I
got the best one.

Was it Susan?

Why? Because she's tall?

Good night.

Can't believe it.

Sheldon loves telling on people
when they break the rules.

Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.

He hasn't changed. Last week,
when the vending machine

gave me two bags of chips,
he called my mom.

Well, that didn't
ruin your life.

Well, it ruined my day.

I had to talk to my mom,

who, by the way, is...
is poly-amorous now,

so that's fun to think about.

Look, I'm proud
of Sheldon and Amy.

You know? They want to win
this thing on their own merits,

not by knocking out
the competition.

Yeah, but what if
they don't win?

Uh, Pemberton and Campbell
have done an amazing job

of associating their names
with super-asymmetry.

They have all the
momentum right now.

I don't like the idea
of them losing either,

but this is their decision
to make, not ours.

Maybe it is ours.

What do you mean?

Well, i... if Sheldon and Amy
don't want to expose Pemberton,

that doesn't mean someone
else can't do it for them.

They'd never have to know.

Really? You'd do that?

They deserve the Nobel.

I'm not gonna let two
frauds steal it from them.

And if that means getting
my hands dirty, so be it.

What's so funny?

Just realized I've never
actually seen your hands dirty.

All right, Hofstadter,

here's all the proof you need.

-Great, thanks.
-Just remember,

once you take this envelope,
there's no turning back.

What if I look at it
and decide not to use it?

I had not considered that.

Got to hand it to you,

you got a real talent
for making things boring.

Thanks.

Hey, look at that,
you did it again.

Hi, Leonard.

What? Nothing.

You okay?

Uh, no, you are.

So guess what.

There was a waitress at
The Cheesecake Factory

back in the day
who kind of had a thing for me.

Other than Bernadette?
That does not sound right.

Honest to God.

Oh, well, who was it?

It doesn't even matter.
I'm happily married.

The point is women...

plural... find me appealing.

Okay. Okay, well,
well, let's see.

Okay? We... we know
it wasn't Penny,

-we know it wasn't Susan...
-Wait.

How do we know it wasn't Susan?

Uh, because she had a type.

What type?

Don't make me say it.

Are you saying
I'm not a handsome guy?

See? It's mean, right?

Hold on, as we've established,

a minimum of two women
think I'm attractive.

Uh, yeah, you're right,
it was totally Susan.

I didn't say it was her, right.

I said it could've been.
It could've been anybody.

Marta, Gina, Annalise...

It's a little creepy that
you remember all their names.

Not just their names.

The cars they drove,
the colour of their eyes,

and whether or not
they had boyfriends.

Your husband was acting
kind of weird today.

You sure you're not thinking
about your husband?

No.

He was acting all sketchy.

Almost like he was
guilty or something.

Oh. Well,
that doesn't mean anything.

I mean, Leonard has
resting guilt face.

Yeah, it's... it's like, 'What are
you guilty about, Leonard?'

'Nothing.' 'Well, then,
tell it to your face.'

Are you okay?

I'm so okay, yeah.

Then why are you
acting guilty now?

Okay, look, Leonard knows

that you and Sheldon
decided to take the high road,

so he went to Kripke for you.

But that just means you
didn't do anything wrong,

and now you don't risk
losing to those idiots.

Why did you tell me?

Now that I know, I'm implicated.

But you wanted me to.

I also wanted you
to be my jester

at the Renaissance Fair,
but that didn't happen.

I wanted to be a princess.

There was only one princess,
and it was me!

Fine.

I'm sorry I told you.

And I forgive you.

'Cause that's what
a princess would do.

Kudos on the meatballs.

They're nice and round.

-Thanks.
-Yeah.

They're much better than
those prolate spheroids

you used to pass off as balls.

Okay.

Are you all right?
You seem distracted.

Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying
to figure something out.

Is it what to get me
for our anniversary?

'Cause I'll give you a hint:

it's already in my Amazon basket.
Just click 'buy now.'

I filled out
the gift card for you.

Apparently, I'm the
light of your life.

Sheldon,

if someone were
gonna do something

ethically murky on your behalf,

would you rather know about it

or not know about it to
retain your innocence?

Well, now that I know
there's a thing to know,

I have to know.

Can't help myself;
I'm a fact addict.

That's not a real thing.

And that's a fact.

Leonard, I know what
you're planning to do,

and I said
I didn't want to do it.

What? You told him?

Well, you told me.

Yeah, that's... that's
probably where you heard it.

You're not doing anything wrong.

That's the point.
I'm doing it.

Yeah, but it's still wrong.

Well, so is you
and Amy not getting

the recognition
for your discovery.

And if that means I have
to do something shady

so you don't have to,
I'm okay with that.

But we're not.

I mean, it's sweet
that you want to help,

but we don't want you compromising
your integrity for us.

Wait, what... really?

I thought we were just
worried about looking bad.

It could be both.

Okay.

But I'm gonna go with my reason.

Yours is too complicated.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Listen, I did
something kind of...

stupid today.

Okay.

I went to The Cheesecake Factory

to try to figure out
who that waitress was.

-Howie.
-Don't worry, I didn't find out,

because I realized
I didn't even care.

W... while I was there,
I started asking myself,

'Why does this mean
anything to me?' And...

I guess the truth is

it was all about my vanity.

And why should I need to be
validated by another woman

liking me when...

the best woman in the
world already loves me?

And I just wanted
you to know that.

The restaurant manager
already called.

You really creeped
a lot of people out.

And I regret that.

Because the only
woman I want to...

creep out is the...

mother of my children.

Well, you're off
to a good start.

Thank you for meeting us.

No problem.

We never say no when someone
wants to buy us lunch.

We didn't say we were
going to buy you lunch.

Really?

Apologies go down easier with
free turkey club sandwiches.

This isn't another apology.

There's something
we have to give you.

Yes.

Uh, we have proof...

that you plagiarized
your thesis.

It's why we invited
you to this lunch.

We invited them.

That's the confusion
over who's paying.

Hold on, are you
blackmailing us?

No, the opposite.

We're blackmailing you?

How are you up for a Nobel?

We're giving you this

so that no one can
use it against you,

because we want to win
on our own merits,

not by tearing you down.

So it's true?
You really did this?

It was years ago, and
I was going through

-a very hard time.
-What hard time?

I had to write a thesis, and
I wasn't smart enough to do it.

You realize my name
is attached to yours.

If this gets out,
it ruins me, too.

It's not gonna get out.

You know what?
Linda was right.

You're always
looking for shortcuts.

When did you talk to my ex-wife?

She's not your ex-wife.

You keep dragging your
feet on those papers.

Well, I'm trying to
get the lake house.

You're not getting
the lake house.

You're never
getting the lake house.

She picked it out,
she decorated it.

The lake house is hers.

What is going on here?

I'm in love with Linda!

You son of a bitch!

That was my iced tea.

Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler.

Just the guy I want to see.

Are you drunk?

I was,

and then I still was.

And now,

I still was.

Okay, can we help you?

Pemberton is out.

Someone published all the
information about his plagiarism.

It was me.

Someone else told Fermilab,
and he lost his job.

Also me.

And someone is sleeping with
his ex-wife and it's not me.

I thought it was.

Not anymore.

Apparently, just because
I'm better than her husband

doesn't mean I'm as
good as her contractor.

Women, huh?

I... I think you need to go.

No, wait.
Hear me out.

Look, the three of us
could team up.

There's one small catch.

Dr. Pemberton has been saying
a lot of bad stuff about me.

But don't worry,

I couldn't possibly
have done any of it,

because I was with you guys
the whole time.

I did it.

Frankly, I don't know what Linda

ever saw in either of them.

Leonard, when are you leaving

to pick your mother up
from the airport?

Uh, well, let's see, her
plane gets in at 3:00,

figure half an hour to get
her luggage, so... never.

Never?

Isn't that usually
when you go to the gym?

Are you really not gonna
pick up your mother?

No... it's fine, she likes
to take a cab or a shuttle.

That way she can meet people.

Well, that's kind of nice.

Yeah, she always says
that a stranger is just

a person whose emotional weak
point you haven't found yet.

Your mom is the best.

Oh, maybe I should pick her up.

You don't drive.

That's what makes you
and me a great team.

Go get your keys.

You can't pick her up.

It'll make me
look like a bad son.

I imagine that's
one of the things

we'll talk about on the ride.

That and Amy's recent
reluctance to use turn signals.

We were in a parking garage.

Come on, she gave birth to you.

Fine, I'll pick her up.

Good, I'll go with you.

I call back seat.

Oh, I don't want to be
the only one who doesn't go.

I'll just sit here afraid that
you're all talking about me.

We're not gonna talk about you.

Well, that's my other fear.

This is crazy. I can
pick her up by myself.

So it's just you?

How was your flight?

There were some
parents with a baby.

A lot of crying.

Well, babies do that.

No, it was the parents.

It seems they couldn't handle
some constructive criticism.

Hey, on a completely
unrelated note, um,

you know, if you'd
rather stay at a hotel,

we wouldn't be offended.

Actually, I've been looking
forward to staying with you.

Really?

It's just, normally,
you stay at a hotel.

Would you like me
to stay at a hotel?

No, no, no. I...

I invited you to stay with us.

And I accepted,

so everyone is happy.

Yep.

I'm happy,

you're happy...

everyone's happy.

How come we never eat
in the dining room?

Oh, that's for company.

What am I?

Apparently, a guy who wants
to have his feelings hurt.

When does Anu come
back from London?

Next week.

But it's been good, you know?

Really given me a chance
to focus on myself.

How's that going?

I didn't like what I saw,
got in my car, drove over here.

-Hey, guys.
-Hey. -Hey.

I'm sorry, I didn't
know you had company.

It's all right,
neither did they.

Is Stuart home?

No, he's at work.

The last juice.
I'm gonna add it to the list.

That's whose
handwriting that is.

I've noticed she's been
over here a lot lately.

You know how you noticed that?

Because you're over
here a lot lately.

She has slept over
every night this week.

Uh, no, no, she wasn't
here Wednesday night.

Yes, she was. You didn't notice

because you were in the hot tub
in the backyard eating Oreos.

That reminds me.

Oreos.

Really?

A photon entanglement team.

Yeah, I... I'm actually the co-lead.

Yeah, if you like photons
and how they get entangled,

he's your co-guy.

I would enjoy seeing your lab.

Oh.

Yeah, sure. Uh,

if you want, you
can come tomorrow.

I look forward to it.

Well, I think
I'm going to turn in.

Good night, Penny.

Good night, dear.

-Good night.
-Night, Beverly.

Wow, she's being really nice.

Yeah, clearly,
one of us is dying.

Come on, her.

Or you accomplished
something great,

and she's genuinely proud.

Yeah, all right,
you've had enough.

Hi.

Hey.

Oh, it's so good
to see your face.

H... how's the concierge
conference?

You guys just get
theatre tickets

for each other all day long?

It's going great,

and the company put me
in a nice place in Notting Hill.

Notting Hill? Like the movie?

Uh, 'I'm just a boy standing
in front of a girl saying...'

you better bring
me home a T-shirt.

I can't wait for you
to come home.

Actually, that's one
of the reasons I called.

They offered me
a management position.

That's amazing.
T... that's your dream.

It's here in London.

Oh.

And they want me
to start right away.

What does that mean for us?

Well,

how committed are you to
staying in California?

This is where my work is,

this is where my friends are.

But are you happy?

Not for years.
What's your point?

All right, I got to head
out to my drawing class.

Fruit or naked dudes?

Actually, it doesn't matter,
I'm jealous of both.

-I'll see you tonight?
-Yeah.

So she's coming over again, huh?

Yeah, we're gonna
do a movie night.

It's my house. Don't you...

think you should ask me?

You're right, I'm sorry.

Howard, would you like
to come to movie night?

Doesn't she have her own place?

Why don't you guys
hang out there?

Oh, she has a room mate,
and he's kind of creepy.

A... and that's coming from me.

It just feels like Denise
is basically living with us.

You know, maybe you can spend
half the time at her place.

Hey, when I moved in, you
and Bernadette said it was okay

if I brought girls over.

Oh. We were making fun of you.

And this is a high-pulse
laser with a BBO crystal.

It's pretty cool.

It emits photons
in discrete bursts.

Huh. Very impressive.

But...?

But what, dear?

Oh, I don't know.

It's just,
usually there's a 'but'

followed by something
that makes me feel bad.

Ah, Beverly, there you are.

Sheldon, how nice to see you.

Leonard was just
showing me his new lab.

Oh, yes, experimental physics,

the carpentry of the science world.
Well...

I'm here to rescue you
from the boredom.

Not necessary. This is
really quite interesting.

But...?

But nothing.

Oh.

Well, if you want to see
something really interesting,

I could show you my work,

which is being talked about
for a Nobel Prize.

Oh, well, I'd love
to see it later,

but right now, I'm
spending time with my son.

Ha! I knew there was
a 'but'... wait, what?

Ready?

You sure I didn't need
to see Paddington 1?

He's a bear, he talks,
no one knows why.

You're all caught up.

Push play.

May I join you?

Oh. Hey, Mitch, I...

didn't see you there.

Really?

I've been standing
here the whole time.

Well, sure. Yeah, join us.

Movie's up there.

I've seen it.

It's wonderful.

So she's staying in London?

What does that mean
for your relationship?

It's great.

I can see why she would
say that, but why do you?

Well, we got into this

because we both
wanted to get married,

and honestly, we've
been dragging our feet,

and I think this
is the push that we need.

Wait, so you're gonna
ask her to marry you?

Why not?

We like each other, plus,

we both want to start a family.

Hey, I can work from anywhere,
I'm an astronomer.

They have stars in London,

and I'm not just talking
about Dame Judi Dench.

No one thought you were.

I thought he was.

So you're really gonna move
halfway across the world?

If she says yes,

and if that's what
she wants to do, then,

yeah.

Wow.

Yeah, I know.
I'm flying out tomorrow.

I'm gonna surprise
her with a ring.

You already have a ring?

Well, it's the
same one as before.

I thought you gave it to her

the first time you got engaged?

I did, but I took it back.

So,

you're an Indian giver?

Howie.

What? If he's gonna
move to England,

I need to get all these out now.

Here you go.
Light cream, no sugar.

That's perfect, thank you.

Beverly, I have to
say, it's so nice

seeing the two of you get along.

Oh, I've always
gotten along with Leonard.

Of all of my children,
he's the most docile.

She wrote that
in a birthday card once.

I keep it in my night-stand.

Still, it made him so happy

showing you around
his lab yesterday.

Interesting.

Would you say that
that made him, uh,

much happier than usual,

somewhat happier than usual
or as happy as usual?

Hmm, multiple choice.

Um, I'm-a go with D:
'that's a weird question.'

It made me really happy.

We haven't always had
the easiest relationship.

But,

well, looking back, I guess
you were just trying to

push me to be the best
version of myself.

So you would say that
my parenting strategies,

although difficult at times,

directly contributed
to your current success?

Well, I may have had a little
something to do with it.

I mean, how often do you wear

your superhero underwear now?

-Only Fridays and my birthday.
-Yeah, that was all me.

That was me.

Yeah, that's a fair point.

I hadn't considered
your influence.

Perhaps tomorrow I could
observe the two of you together?

Uh, 'observe'?

What is going on?

I'm just visiting with my son

and doing research for
my book on how various

parenting strategies affected
my children as adults.

This has all been work to you?

Hanging out with me
and coming to my lab, I...

I thought we were enjoying
each other's company,

but it was just research.

I was enjoying it;
you know I love research.

I can't believe this.

-What? You seem angry.
-Of course I'm angry!

Well, so would you say
that you're somewhat angry,

very angry or extremely angry?

Never mind.
I can see it in your face, dear.

I'm looking over my text
correspondence with Beverly

and I don't see anything that
would have given her offence.

Nothing's ambiguous,

I spell everything out.

Including 'laugh out loud'
and 'what's the fracas?'

I'm sure she's not mad at you.

Well, then why would she rather
spend the day with Leonard?

Because he's her son?

Amy, I just feel like
we're going in circles.

You... what?

No knock? What's the fracas?

I am so stupid.

I... I actually thought my mom
was genuinely proud of me.

It turns out,
she's just using me

as research for her new book.

Oh, what a relief.

I thought Beverly was mad at me.
Thank you, Leonard.

That is a weight
off my shoulders.

If you like her so much,

you can have her,
'cause I... I'm done.

Oh, great. Catch the
two of you later.

Sheldon, no.

Why?

Well, it's an emotionally
complex issue.

I don't have time
to explain it right now.

Okay, but that excuse
is running out of steam.

Well, Raj is probably
on his way to the airport.

Yeah.

Guess he's finally getting
his big romantic movie moment.

With a woman who
doesn't care about

big romantic movie moments.

Well,

he'll have the rest of his
life to explain them to her.

You can't really think
this is a good idea.

Of course I don't.
What am I supposed to do?

Go stop him. Get your
best friend back.

You're my best friend.

We don't have time for this! Go!

You know, Leonard
was really upset.

Shouldn't you go talk to him?

And send the message
that he can get what he wants

by throwing a tantrum?
I don't think so.

Beverly, put down your phone

and go apologize to your son.

Oh, so now you're not
talking to me?

When you're finished with
your tantrum, I'd be glad to.

Just let me know
when you're done.

Oh, my God.

When am I gonna stop
trying to win her approval?

E... every time I'm around her,

I... I turn into this needy
little eight-year-old boy.

You sound like that now
and she's not even here.

If I could respond more
compassionately than Sheldon...

and thank you
for making it so easy.

The need for a mother's approval
is baked into our biology.

I know that, it's just...

after all these years,

you'd think I
would have learned.

Hmm. It's too bad you didn't.

Well, see?

Compassion.

You okay?

Oh, yeah. My neck's
a little stiff.

Maybe because my
boyfriend made me sleep

in a comic book
store last night.

Bet your neck would hurt
if you slept in any store.

Except maybe a mattress store.

I... I'm sorry, but I couldn't
sleep at your place.

Mitch was really
freaking me out.

He was freaking me out, too,

but there has to be
a better solution.

Tonight we'll go
back to my place.

And tomorrow?

With my health being what it is,

I try to live one day at a time.

I don't want to blame you,

but if you'd moved in with me
when I asked you to,

we wouldn't be in
this situation.

You're right.

It's my fault.

When I had the chance,
I was scared and...

now that I want to,
you're stuck with Mitch.

So you do want to
move in with me?

More than Galactus
wants to devour worlds.

Well, that's great 'cause
I want to move in with you

more than the Thing
wants to clobber.

More than Hulk wants to smash?

More than Batman wants to ignore

the due process of law.

We are so weird.

Raj! Stop!

What?

What are you doing here?

Look...

if you're getting on that plane

because you love Anu and you...

can't stand the thought of
spending another day without her...

then go.

If not...

then stay here with...

the people who love you.

But what if this is my last
chance at marriage and family?

I promise you it's not.

Believe me, somewhere out there

is a woman who
loves cooking shows

and sweater vests and...

all the other dumb
things you love.

You really think so?

Yes.

And I don't think she's...

waiting for you in England.

When you propose to
someone in Notting Hill...

it should be to someone who
knows what that movie is.

Are you saying...

you're just a boy...

standing in front
of another boy...

saying you don't
want him to leave?

Sure.

I love you, buddy.

I love you, too.

No.

No, no, that's not
what's happening here.

Come on.

How'd you get past security?

I had to buy a ticket.
You owe me 1,300 bucks.

Penny, can I have a
moment alone with my...?

Yep, bye.

Have you calmed down?

No, I'm not calm.
You really hurt me.

That wasn't my intention.

It doesn't matter
what you intended.

What matters is the way
you made me feel.

Actually, the way y... you've
always made me feel.

I see, so...

you're here to tell me
all the ways

-that I failed you as a mother.
-Yeah.

And get comfortable,
'cause I... it's a long list.

Is it happening soon?

You know what?
It doesn't matter.

Doesn't matter,
you're never gonna change.

If I want you
to accept me for me,

then I guess I'm gonna
have to accept you for you.

So...

I forgive you.

I didn't ask you to forgive me.

Too bad. I forgive you anyway.

And I forgive myself for
taking so long to do it.

Oh, my God, that feels so good.

I must admit, it...

it does feel good.

What does?

You forgiving me.

It means a lot.

Thank you.

Look, I was...
scared to move in,

but that was a mistake
because she is amazing

and I really want
to live with her.

So...

think you'd be willing
to find another place?

Do you love her?

Oh, we haven't
really said that yet.

Yeah, I do.

Don't say it to me,
say it to her.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Now both of you say it to me.

Guess I'm your new neighbour.
Penny.

Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.

Hi.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-Hi.
-Hi.

That's where I sit.

Howard Wolowitz.

Caltech Department
of Applied Physics.

Penny?

Leonard.

Raj?

He speaks English...
he just can't speak to women.

Our babies will be
smart and beautiful.

Finally caught a break.

# Soft kitty...

You know my girlfriend,
Bernadette.

Howard, I'm hungry!

# Warm kitty...

# Little ball of fur...

I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

Bazinga.

Welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents

Fun with Flags.

I'm going up in space.
Technically, I'm an astronaut.

Oy vey!

You're talking to me.

I am.

Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

Amy?

Howard?

Angry Amy?

I don't want you to say it

just because social convention
dictates that you...

I love you, too.

Will you marry me?

Yes.

We did it!

Well, I enjoyed that more
than I thought I would.

I wonder which one's Halley.

Will you marry me?

That... means...

positive?

Super asymmetry, that's it!

Our paper was right.

-We did it!
-We did it?

We did it!

# Six times ten
to the eighth atoms #

# Of a radium in a lead jar

# Six times ten to the eighth
atoms of radium #

# If the half-life of radium
should happen to pass #

# Three times ten
to the eighth atoms #

# Of a radium in a lead jar...

Really hope you're
almost to zero.

No, see, that's the
beauty of half-lives:

it's impossible to determine
when you'll arrive at zero.

It's like 'Wheels on the Bus'

if the bus had an
unknowable number of parts.

Yeah, we're gonna
need more coffee.

Yep. I'm with you.
Leonard, coffee?

Black and strong,
like Luke Cage.

I'm too tired to even
be disturbed by that.

Sheldon?

Mm, absolutely not, no.

The Nobel committee will be
making the calls to inform

the winners at any minute,

so the only drug I need

is the endorphins pumping
through my brain

in anticipation of our victory.

Well, technically, anticipation
wouldn't be mediated

by endorphins as much
as dopamine, but, you know,

you've been up all night,
so I'll give you that one.

Really? The second
he stops talking?

Well... should we wake him up?

Well, he did say
if he fell asleep,

we were allowed
to slap him awake.

Oh, boy.

Wait a minute.
Why do you get to do it?

'Cause I called it.

Well, you can't just call it.
You have to earn it.

Oh, and you've earned it?

No one has earned it
more than me.

You have your whole life
to smack him around.

This is my time.

Fine. Don't miss.

It's not a volleyball.
I can handle it.

Oh, wait. Hang on.

When you're old, you are
gonna want a record of this.

Oh, oh, yeah.

Do it in slo-Mo. I want
to see his cheeks ripple.

Ready... go.

It's happening!

Unknown caller.
It's got to be them.

Okay, put it on speaker.

-Hello?
-Hi.

Hello. This is Sweden calling.

Is this Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler?

-Yes.
-Yeah.

Congratulations.

It is my pleasure to inform you

that you've won the Nobel Prize

in being suckers...!

His Swedish accent
was very convincing.

This is it!

What do you want, Howard?

We were just calling to see
if you'd heard yet.

We haven't.

But thank you for getting up
so early to call.

That was very thoughtful.

Oh, please. We have
two little kids.

We've been up for an hour.

Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?

No.

Okay, well, call us
when you hear.

All right, now what?

Oh, why don't we play a
game to pass the time?

Here. Uh, I am thinking
of a number.

Hint: It's a cube of
a cube of a prime.

There's an infinite number
of possibilities.

What, you got somewhere to be?

Oh. That's me.

Hello?

Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.

I see.

Okay, thank you.

We won.

Congratulations!

Oh, my God!

We did it.

I know.

Can you believe it?

That's a good point.
What if I'm dreaming?

We won the Nobel Prize!

And how does it feel to be
married to a Nobel Prize winner?

You tell me.

Oh. Amy-centric...

what a fun way to look at it.

I think so.

You would. That makes sense.

Ooh.

Aw. It's a congratulations
text from my meemaw.

Ooh. Oh, and there's
one from my mom.

And my sister.

Oh, and my brother.

And my brother's ex-wife.

My brother's other ex-wife.

Boy, they don't tell you
when you win a Nobel

it chews up your phone battery.

Oh, that's me.

It's CVS.
My prescription's ready.

Oh, and also my dad.

He says congratulations
and he loves me.

Nothing about me?

Oh.

Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.

You know, when you
think about it,

now that we're Nobel
Prize winners,

our names will be
linked together forever.

We're married.

Our names are already
linked together forever.

Oh, please. That's
just a piece of paper.

This is a piece of
paper and a medal.

It's weird. I don't
really feel different,

but I guess our lives
will never be the same.

Oh, I don't know.

We're going to work like always.

I still put my pants on
both legs at a time.

One day that's
gonna end very badly.

Congratulations.
How does it feel?

Okay, w... we're happy
to answer your questions,

Just, um, one at a time, please?

Dr. Cooper!

Is Dr. Cooper coming back?

No. Next question.

Was it your left hand
or your right hand?

Right.

Spit actually flew
out of his mouth.

Hey, fellas.

Can you do me a favour?

Do we have a choice?

Ha-ha!

No.

Sheldon and Amy are now
officially superstars,

and the press will
be reaching out

to their family and
friends for comment.

So that we're all
on the same page,

the word we're gonna use
to describe them is 'quirky.'

And not quirky.
More like quirky.

So not Mr. and Mrs. Wackadoodle?

Ho-ho-ho!

You bitter, envious little man.

Thank you so much.

And what do we call that?

-Quirky.
-Quirky. -Quirky.

Dr. Cooper, can I get
a minute of your time?

Hello?

Hey.

Can I help you?

Uh, yeah, actually.
Um, I had an appointment

to interview Dr. Cooper
about the Nobel.

Hang on a second.

Sheldon?

Sorry, he's not here.

Damn. I've got a deadline.

I don't know if it
helps you at all,

but I'm his best friend
in the whole world.

Really?

And an astronaut. Come on,

you can buy me a cup of coffee,

and I'll tell you about both.

Everyone okay in there?

Go away!

Amy?

Raj, please, not now.

Hey, what's wrong?

My picture's
all over the Internet,

and I look terrible.

No. Let me see.

Well, that is
an unfortunate angle.

But who cares?

You just won the Nobel.

You should be proud
of this moment.

I know I shouldn't care
about how I look,

and I never thought I did.

It... it's stupid and shallow,
but I just can't help it.

Am I really this frumpy?

No.

No, you are a beautiful woman.

By the way, if you're not happy

with those pictures,
then make some changes.

Get a haircut,

new clothes, new
glasses, big glasses...

No glasses... then you won't
be able to see those pictures.

Sounds expensive.

Excuse me,
I... if I'm not mistaken,

the Nobel comes with
a substantial cash prize.

What were you gonna spend it on?

Hadn't really thought about it.

Sheldon's got his eyes
on some new Dockers.

Come on. Do something
for yourself.

Well, I suppose
I could get a haircut.

And some make-up

and a new wardrobe

and a little thank you gift
for your shopping buddy

if we see something
he likes. Come on.

Where are we going?

Beverly Hills, where
the things he likes are.

Dinner ready?

Not unless you cooked.

Why is this article about
Sheldon all about you?

Let me see.

Oh, good, they used
my NASA picture.

Why does it say that
you're his best friend?

Leonard's his best friend.

No.

Leonard has always been
kind of a monkey butler.

Whenever Sheldon
got into a scrape,

I was his go-to guy.

When did he get into a scrape?

You're kidding, right?

W... remember when
he had a panic attack

'cause his hand got stuck
in a jar of olives?

I was the one who told him
to let go of the olives.

Please, that doesn't
make you his best friend.

You know, that reporter...

asked me if I could put
him in touch with...

Amy's best friend.

That's Penny.

Doesn't have to be.

Hmm.

What kind of tea is appropriate
for winning a Nobel Prize

and now everything is changing

and you feel unmoored
from reality?

I don't know. Earl Grey?

You know, this is something
I've wanted my whole life.

But I guess I never considered

how everything
would be different.

Buddy, I... I know it all feels
overwhelming right now,

but I promise you,
things will settle down.

There's no Earl Grey!
You filthy liar!

Hey, is Penny here?

No. Why?

I wanted to show her
my latest creation.

I give you...

Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

Wow. Amy, you
look amazing.

Thank you.

Sheldon, what do you think?

I like you better
the way you were.

But she looks beautiful!

Classic lines,

colours that complement
her skin tone,

and hair that goes from 'office'
to 'on the town' in minutes.

I don't care.
Put it back.

I like the way I look.

Well, I don't!

My fault. I was
out of Earl Grey.

Sheldon, that was really rude.

I'm sorry.

Amy is the one constant
I can count on,

and now she's changing.

It's just a haircut
and some clothes.

No, it's the last straw!

I can't take any more!

Can you believe it?
They finally fixed the elevator.

This is a nightmare.

What's with him?

He won a Nobel Prize,
and his wife looks amazing.

Oh. Yeah, got it.

How did you get down here?

The elevator. It's really fast.

I... I need to be alone right now.

Don't try to follow me.

All right.
You need a ride?

That'd be great.
Thank you.

I should've seen this coming.

Oh, stop. You're allowed
to get a haircut.

I know.

But I should've done it
gradually.

You know, like...

maybe 300 tiny haircuts
over a ten-year period.

Okay, you need to
focus on the positive.

You won a Nobel Prize.

I slapped Sheldon.

A lot of dreams came true today.

You know,

you're right.

This is a huge day for me,

and I'm allowed to enjoy it

without worrying how it's
going to affect my husband.

Is it me or did it just
get fierce in here?

All this change
is just too much.

The reporters,
the attention at work,

and now even Amy's changed.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

I'm playing a drinking game.

Every time you say the word
'change,' I take a slug.

Are you gonna be able
to drive me home?

Mm. Not unless you
change the subject.

Huh.

Now I said it.
Meh. Hmm.

You know, you're the
only person who could win

the biggest prize in science
and still be upset about it.

It's just...

all the times I
thought about winning,

I never thought
about how it would ch...

affect my life.

I'm sorry, I'm genuinely
concerned about your liver.

Okay.

Fine, I'll stop playing.

You know, you go on and on

about wanting things
to stay the same,

but you've changed a
lot since I met you.

Oh, you are a mean drunk.

I'm serious.

You have a ton of friends,

you got married, moved
into a new apartment,

you wore a baseball
hat that one time.

Heck, you've had sex almost

as many times as I have fingers.

More.

W...

By this many.

You dog!

It was the Avengers trailer.

Oh.
Mm-hmm.

You know, I've grown, too.

I used to be the
bartender back there.

That's true.

And now there is a
completely different woman

who botched my drink order.

How hard is 65% Coke,
35% Diet Coke?

Well, judging by the
look on her face,

it's at least one
percent saliva.

I do take your point.

You know, you're also married,

you have a successful career,

you no longer dress
like you're trying

to attract sailors by the wharf.

So, I guess the only thing
that actually stays the same

is that things are
always changing.

Interesting.

So you're saying the
inevitability of change

might be a universal constant.

Well, there's a little more to
it than that, but, yeah, sure.

Oh. Hey, look,
that's Bernadette.

I can't tell you how many times

Dr. Fowler was gonna give up
and I would say to her,

'Amy, as your best friend,

I'm not gonna let you quit.'

Okay, I'm drinking again.

I'll join you.
Waitress,

uh, 95% Hawaiian Punch,
five percent vodka.

Let me tell you about the time

Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...

This is a good one.

You know what, 90/10!

You know, I like
the way my hair looks.

I'm done tiptoeing around him.

We're all guilty of it.

But why?

'Cause we were afraid
to upset him.

Which happens anyway.

Well, that's over.

I'm... I'm done enabling him.

Like, this is his spot and...

and the thermostat has to
be set to his comfort level,

even though he doesn't
even live here anymore

and I'm always chilly.

Is that why you wear
a hoodie all the time?

Why would... Yes!

To accommodate Sheldon!

And what... what
about this... this thing?

Why is it here?
I'll tell you why.

Because it was here
when I moved in,

and, for no earthly reason,

he forbade me to touch it.

Well, if you don't like it,

get rid of it.

Put it in the closet.

You know what,

I will.

I bet that's the reason.

Hang on.

What do you think?

Want to give it a try?

Well,

you know, the elevator did work

when I moved into the building.

So going up and down
the stairs was a change,

which means this would actually
be a return to the status quo.

-But, conversely, I think...
-Get in!

This is wild.

Carbon.

Hydrogen.

Carbon.

Carbon.

And last but not least, carbon.

This might be the glue talking,

but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

Agreed.

What kind of DNA
is this, anyway?

I was trying to design
the genetic code

of an advanced race
of human being.

One of my rare
failures, actually.

What went wrong?

The balls kept
sticking to my pants.

Let's just let it dry.

-Hi.
-Hello.

Hey, babe.

-Oh, don't slam the...
-Don't slam the...

That was exhilarating.

-You pick up your dresses?
-Yep.

The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

Best day of my life.

What about the day you met me?

I stand by my statement.

Well, thank you guys
so much for the clothes

and the shoes,
the plane tickets.

You've been so generous.

Well, it's important
that all of our friends

get to share
this moment with us.

And then for years to
come, you can tell others

you had a front-row
seat to history.

Although, technically,

I think your seats are
in the second row.

Do you want to go
back to the apartment

and see me try on my dress?

Shouldn't I see it for the first
time at the Nobel ceremony?

It's not a wedding.

Okay. Well, give me
a minute to think

of another reason I
don't want to see it.

How about this...

you can practice your
acceptance speech

while I try on the dress.

Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

Was Amy suspicious when
they had to let your dress out?

No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

Someone's gonna figure it out.

-Why don't we just tell people?
-No, it's too early.

I haven't even wrapped
my head around it.

-I have. My head is wrapped.
-Yeah, well...

if something else
had been wrapped,

we wouldn't be in
this situation.

Excuse me, but if I recall,

you're the one who went
out drinking with Sheldon,

then came home and attacked me.

Attacked you? I said,
'Do you wanna?'

Yeah.

-I was helpless.
-Uh-huh.

So...

do you wanna?

Well, I can't get more pregnant.

Mm-hmm.
We'll see about that.

Now, Michael,

Mommy and Daddy are going
away for a couple days,

so if you're gonna say
your first words,

you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

Somebody just peed
in the big girl potty.

Oh, I'm so proud!

It was her, right?

Yes.

You still feel good about...

leaving them with Stuart and
Denise for a couple days?

I guess.

I just hope we don't miss
Michael's first words.

Or Stuart's last words.

You realize it's been years

since we've got away
just the two of us.

I know. I can't wait.

Fancy hotel room.
The big bed.

Yeah. We're gonna
sleep our asses off.

You really think walking her
is gonna help me meet girls?

Cinnamon is chick bait.

Good. 'Cause I'm not.

Just remember,
you're in charge.

Don't let her pull you.

That seems like an
unnecessary thing to say.

And please, if you
have any problems,

any questions, call
me immediately, okay?

She's my baby.

It shouldn't come up,
but just in case:

where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

Kidding. If she dies,
I'll just tell you.

Ready?

Oh. Hang on.

Go.

'Your majesties, members
of the Nobel Academy...

'when I was a young boy
growing up in East Texas

'I always knew
I'd wind up on this stage,

'and everybody who
said I wouldn't

'looks pretty darn
foolish right now.

'I'm talking about you,

high school science teacher
Mr. Hubert Givens...'

'Sheldon, Sheldon.

Why are you talking so fast?

I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

Nobody's gonna be able to
understand a word you're saying.

Welcome to my life.

I think you need
to do some editing,

like maybe cut out all
that stuff about your childhood.

Are you kidding?

Growing up in the
backwoods of East Texas

is what makes me warm
and relatable.

Well, what about all these pages

calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

I told them all
they would rue the day.

How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

and they're not filled with rue?

Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

This is about...

humbly accepting a great honour.

Amy, we won the Nobel
Prize in Physics.

Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels

like Literature,
Economics and Peace.

Please tell me that's
not in your speech.

Oh. I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

All right, bagels down.
Before we head to the airport,

I'd like to go over
a few things.

From the moment we
step off the plane,

each and every one of you
is an ambassador

for Amy and myself.

I told you these
tickets weren't free.

As such, your behaviour must
reflect the highest standards.

Uh, Raj. Bagel down.

If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

Amy, why don't you kick us off.

Thank you.

'The challenging
climate of Scandinavia

'has left its mark on
the Swedish character.

'These dour, latter-day Vikings

'are slow to warm up
to strangers,

'but if you follow
a few easy steps,

a Swede can be your
friend for life.'

'Number one,

'in Sweden, punctuality
is taken very seriously.

'In other words, the

'Two, at the beginning

Yes, you're all encouraged
to pair off and practice this

once we're in the air
and the seat belt sign is off.

Yes, Penny?

Oh. Do we have to go?

Yes. And a reminder, Penny,
there's free alcohol

in business class...
don't abuse it.

Relax. I'm not gonna drink.

-Why? You pregnant?
-Wha...? No.

No, I just, you know, I don't
like to drink when I fly.

Please. I've seen you
drink in the shower.

You guys have showered together?

Sometimes you're just...

ech.

That wasn't a no.

All right, well, we should
head out now if we're gonna get

to the airport six
hours before boarding.

Excuse me. Hello?
What did we just learn

about the end of
business meetings?

Oh, my God.

Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.

Go on.

You first. Go.

Wait.

-Help me!
-Oh.

-Help me!
-Oh, wait. Come here.

-We got this.
-Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

Hang on.
I've... I've got an idea.

Well done. You know,
you're proving to be

an invaluable part
of my entourage.

Cool.

Yeah?

How you doing?

Fine. Why?

Well, this is the...

furthest we've ever
been away from the kids.

I was just checking
to see if you're okay.

I'm on my second Jack Reacher.
I'm doing great.

Good. Me, too.

I was just looking at the map.

Couldn't help
thinking: we're here

and they're there, and
if anything happened,

we'd have to go here to get
all the way back there.

Why are you trying
to freak me out?

This is our vacation.

I thought we should
do things together.

Howard, the kids are okay.

How do you know that?

I just know.
A mother knows.

So what, now the
Force is with you?

Let's see.

This is not the woman
you want to annoy.

-Howard. Howard.
-What?

You see the woman
sitting next to me?

What about her?

Is this her?

Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

Shh! Be cool.

No, that's not her.

Okay.

How about now?

Uh-oh.

That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

in the last two hours.

So?

Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

So?

So she clearly has
some sort of stomach distress.

If it's viral, we're
all susceptible.

She's probably just airsick.

Yeah, but what if she's not?

What if we get what she has?

What if we infect
the King of Sweden?

That's how wars start.

All right, that's it, this is
Outbreak and she's the monkey.

Wait. Stop.

Be reasonable.

Leonard...

we need to do something
about your wife.

-What's the matter?
-She is clearly sick,

and she's gonna take
us all down with her.

She's not sick, Sheldon.

She is, and I'm gonna catch it,

and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

I promise you're not going
to get what she has.

What's going on?

Unclean! Unclean!

What?

He thinks you're sick.

Oh.

Should we tell him?

Well, if we don't, he might try

and jump out of the plane. Yeah.

Doesn't answer my question.

Tell me what?

I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

You're right,
I can't catch that.

Good news, Amy.

She's just pregnant.

Are you kidding me?

You just found out that a woman

who has loved and cared for you

for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

you're relieved that she's
not gonna get you sick?

There's no need for a recap.

I was there.

-Why didn't you tell me?
-I didn't tell anybody.

I'm not anybody.
I'm your best friend.

-What's going on?
-She's pregnant.

That's fantastic!

Why didn't you tell me?

She didn't tell me, either.

But I'm her best friend.

We'll get into that later.

What happened to 'I'm
never gonna have kids'?

It was an accident. I went
out drinking with Sheldon.

Oh, my gosh.

We're sister wives?

No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

-While fantasizing about...
-Leonard.

And a little Idris Elba.

-I mean, ah...
-Oh, yeah.

What would you like me to say?

How about congratulating us?

Are congratulations
even in order?

I didn't think
Penny wanted children.

Well, she didn't, now she
does. And just so you know,

we weren't gonna tell anybody

so we wouldn't
upstage your big day.

Oh, please,
you couldn't upstage us.

We won a Nobel Prize.

Any idiot can have a baby.

Hey. What's going on?

Case in point.

You are a selfish jerk.

To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.

I found her boarding
pass in her purse.

It's totally her.

Hi, Stuart, just checking in.

Seeing if everything's okay.

Oh, yeah, we're having fun.

Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.

-Oh, that's nice.
-Yeah.

I found Denise right away.

Where was Halley hiding?

Uh,

the important thing is
she's not there now.

Okay, so, everyone's
happy and healthy?

Well, that depends.

What's that mean?

Uh, how many teeth

did Halley have when you left?

All of them.

Oh, yeah,

that's... that's what
I was afraid of.

What happened?

Um, well, all right.

Um, Michael had a
little fever last night.

Michael had a fever?

Do you want to hear
about Halley or not?

What happened, Stuart?

He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.

And Halley,

bless her heart, wanted to
bring him his boo-boo bear,

so she climbed
over the safety rail

and took a little tumble
down the stairs.

She fell down the stairs?

She rolled down the stairs,

laughing the whole time.

Anyway, when she
got to the bottom,

there was a tooth missing.

Oh, Stuart!

She's fine!
She thought it was funny.

Did you at least save
it for the tooth fairy?

No, we couldn't find it.

We have a theory

about where it is,
but it'll take

six to eight hours to confirm.

Speaking of which,

where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?

Come on, you didn't
seriously expect him to react

like a normal human being.

No, but still,
a... after all these years,

after all the crap
I've put up with,

you'd think just this once

he'd care about someone
else's feelings.

-Oh, my God!
-What?

Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

Really?

Sounds gross. Looks gross.
Smells gross.

It's delicious!

Ooh, that might
be my salted cod!

What?

Sheldon has something
he'd like to say.

I'm sorry I didn't
react appropriately.

You and Penny are bringing
new life into the world.

Congratulations. I
can't wait to meet it.

'It'?

That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

If you're offended, take it
up with the English language.

Oh, good, you're here.
Listen,

we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

Why?

We just can't
be this far away from the kids.

Bernie's having a meltdown,
and, frankly, so am I.

Yeah, well, pull it together.

This is a big day for me.

Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do.

Now I am.

We're going home.

We'll join you.

Oh, wait. Do I get
a vote in this?

They'll have pickled
herring on the plane.

Bye-bye.

Well, I hate to say it,

but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

Well,

you would be the
authority on the subject.

What does that mean?

Sheldon,

no one is happier than
I am to win the Nobel.

But it's not more
important than our friends.

How can you call them friends

when they're abandoning us?

They're abandoning us

because you broke their hearts.

-I didn't mean to.
-I know!

You never mean to.

That's the only reason
people tolerate you!

Does that include you?

Sometimes, yeah.

Okay, that's it for the fish.

We'll be back with the meatballs

after a short word
from our sponsor.

Oh, thank you.

Leonard, I can't go home.

-I have to be there for Amy.
-Yeah.

I was thinking that, too.

As angry as I am at Sheldon,

I still want to see
him win that medal.

It's so strange.

No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,

I still love him.

If you think about it,

he has kind of been
our practice kid.

Like when you make pancakes

and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

The university prefers 'quirky.'

Hello.

Hey. It's Howard.

Oh, us, too.

Wait, what?

They're gonna stay.

The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

Really?

Oh, poor little guy.

Is Michael okay?

Yeah, it's Stuart.

Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

Yeah. Okay, we'll
meet you in the lobby.

How long is it gonna
take you to get ready?

Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.

Really?

No. What is wrong with you?

And in the field of physics,

Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.

Just to be clear,

this isn't a date.

Yeah, I know.

Then why are you
holding my hand?

Thank you, your majesties.

Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.

We are deeply honoured.

I would just like
to take this moment

to say to all the
young girls out there

who dream about science
as a profession:

go for it.

It is the greatest job

in the world.

And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.

And now,

speaking of not listening,

my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Sheldon.

What? Did you finish? Great job.

Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

I have a very long

and somewhat
self-centred speech here.

But I'd like to set it aside.

-Yeah!
-Way to go!

Because this honour
doesn't just belong to me.

I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't

for some very important
people in my life.

Beginning with my mother,

father, meemaw,

brother and sister.

And my other family,

who I'm so happy
to have here with us.

Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?

I was under a misapprehension

that my accomplishments
were mine alone.

Nothing could be further
from the truth.

I have been encouraged,

sustained,

inspired,

and tolerated

not only by my wife,

but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

I'd like to ask them to stand.

Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

Dr. Bernadette
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.

Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

And my two dearest friends
in the world,

Penny Hofstadter...

and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

He said to me that their babies
would be smart and beautiful.

And now that they're expecting,

I have no doubt that
that will be the case.

Thanks, Sheldon. I... I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.

Oh.

I'm sorry.

Don't tell anyone that last thing.
That's a secret.

Howard,

Bernadette,

Raj,

Penny,

Leonard,

I apologize if I haven't
been the friend you deserve.

But I want you to know

in my way,

I love you all.

And I love you.

Thank you.
