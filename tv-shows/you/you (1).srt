1
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,774
Well, hello there.

2
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,943
Who are you?

3
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,320
Based on your vibe, a student.

4
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,282
Your blouse is loose.

5
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,119
You're not here to be ogled,
but those bracelets, they jangle.

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,954
You like a little attention.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,998
Okay, I bite.

8
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,544
You search the books.
Fiction, "F" through "K."

9
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,837
Now...

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,964
Hmm, you're not
the standard insecure nymph

11
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,759
hunting for Faulkner you'll never finish.

12
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,303
Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,471
Who will you buy?

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
Sorry.

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,021
You sound apologetic,
like you're embarrassed to be a good girl,

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,690
and you murmur your first word to me.

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,152
Hello.

18
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,278
Do you work here?

19
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
Guilty.

20
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,116
-Can I help you find something?
-Paula Fox.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
It's a good choice.

22
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,369
Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,456
Follow me.

24
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,960
She's gonna be in here.

25
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,547
"Celebrity authors"?
I thought Fox was pretty obscure.

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,967
She is Courtney Love's
maternal grandmother.

27
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,177
You're not expected to know that.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,887
Good. I didn't.

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,224
Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here
who's even tangentially famous.

30
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,558
He thinks it sells more books.

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,893
That's sad.

32
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,728
People buying books
because of what's popular,

33
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,898
and not because they wanna be moved
or changed in some way.

34
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
Yeah. It's an epidemic.

35
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,031
Yeah, you see this guy?
Here, the glasses, behind you.

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
He just grabbed Dan Brown's latest
on the way in.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,913
So he's gonna wander around
for another, like, five or ten minutes,

38
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,623
just to find something legitimate
to buy with it.

39
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,626
Oh, like the cereal guys buy
when they're really there for condoms.

40
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,629
Only makes it more conspicuous.
Like, own your shit.

41
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,423
If Dan Brown's your kink,
then be out about it.

42
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,094
At the end of the day,

43
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,429
people really are disappointing,
aren't they?

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
Sometimes they surprise you.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,021
-Paula Fox. Top shelf. You want me to...
-Oh, no, I got it.

46
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,486
Oh. Are you not wearing a bra?

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,655
And you want me to notice.

48
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,948
If this was a movie,

49
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,494
I'd grab you
and we'd go at it right in the stacks.

50
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,873
Have you read her fiction?
Desperate Characters, it's her best.

51
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,541
That's what I keep hearing.

52
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,793
-You haven't read Desperate Characters?
-I know. I know.

53
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm worried
it's not gonna live up to the hype.

54
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,589
I can safely say it is that good.

55
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,384
That's a high endorsement.
And from a bookstore clerk, nonetheless.

56
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,052
Well, it's bookstore manager.

57
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,138
Hello? Anyone working here?

58
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,682
-Asshole.
-Mmm...

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,435
Whoa.

60
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
He's just pissed he's gotta
buy Salinger to feel respectable

62
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,072
when all he really wants to do
is eat Cheetos and jerk it to iPorn

63
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,201
before washing it all down
with a Dan Brown chaser.

64
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
Have a nice day, sir.

65
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,001
Okay, I'm going for it.

66
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,795
-Good. You won't regret it.
-I'd better not.

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,505
Paula Fox. Nice.

68
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,175
You know, she was, uh,
Courtney Love's maternal grandmother.

69
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,384
That's why I'm buying it.

70
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,308
You have enough cash to cover this,
but you want me to know your name.

71
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,518
-"Guinevere"?
-Yeah.

72
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,438
My parents were assholes
with the whole naming thing.

73
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,190
But everyone just calls me Beck.

74
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,985
And you're Joe...

75
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,028
Goldberg.

76
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,989
Everyone calls me Joe.

77
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
Aren't you gonna tell me
to have a nice day?

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,039
You have a nice day, Beck.

79
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,916
You have one yourself, Joe.

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,090
You smiled, laughed at my jokes,

81
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,177
told me your name, asked for mine.

82
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,847
She write her number on there?
She was on you hard.

83
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
No, she was just being nice.

84
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,476
I'd be googling the hell out of her
right now.

85
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,519
You know her full name.

86
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,854
That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

87
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,775
What do I tell you?
Always be closing that shit.

88
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,946
If you need me,
I'll be in cookbooks.

89
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,699
But for work. Not for fun. I swear.

90
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,995
At the end of the day, people are
really just disappointing, aren't they?

91
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,713
But are you, Beck? Are you?

92
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,859
Yes, people find "the one."

93
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,321
I believe that. I try to stay open.

94
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,657
I was in love once.
She broke my heart, Beck.

95
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,201
Ugh, she really did a number on me.

96
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,329
I should've seen the signs.

97
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,540
But we never do when we're in love.

98
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,460
Exhibit A. Claudia and Ron.

99
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,129
I went out for a couple of drinks.
Get off my back.

100
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,631
Claudia's a nurse. Single parent.

101
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,008
Leave me alone!
You're on your phone...

102
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,803
You think she knew Ron was a shitbag
when she fell in love?

103
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,430
No, she thought he was a prince.

104
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,140
Hey, Paco.

105
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,059
'Sup, Joe?

106
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:51,976
And now,

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
- hers is not the only life she ruined.
- Leave me alone!

108
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,066
Why is coming home such a chore for you?

109
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,233
Is everything cool in there?

110
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,402
Yeah, Mom and Ron are just talking.

111
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,361
You always go out
with your friends!

112
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
-And I'm sick of it!
-Wow.

113
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,115
You are burning through that book,
aren't you?

114
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,118
Reads quick. It's good.

115
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,205
Let me know when you finish.
I'll get you another one.

116
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,249
Screw you, Ron! Get out of here!
Leave me alone.

117
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,835
Are you hungry?

118
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,506
'Cause, you know,
I just got this meatball sub,

119
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,508
but I remembered
I have Thai from last night.

120
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,512
Nah. My mom will just
make me something later.

121
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,139
That's a shame. This won't keep.
It's getting tossed.

122
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,391
You sure, Joe?

123
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
"All for one and one for all."

124
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,539
The point, Beck...
Love is, uh, tricky.

125
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,977
A guy needs to protect himself.

126
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,938
I had to be sure you're safe.

127
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
And your name
was a glorious place to start.

128
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,818
Not a lot of Guinevere Becks.

129
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,780
And there you were.
Every account set to public.

130
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,452
You want to be seen, heard, known.

131
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,912
Of course, I obliged.

132
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,125
Born and raised, Nantucket Island.

133
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,003
A brother, Clyde, and sister, Anya.

134
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,173
Your parents really were assholes
about the names.

135
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,343
Your folks split when you were 12.
Your dad dropped out of the picture.

136
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
Went to Brown
where you majored in lit. Cool.

137
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,932
And minored in douchebags. Hmm.

138
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,769
And then on to NYC to conquer an MFA
and make your mark, presumably.

139
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
Now you still write. Barely.

140
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,774
Too busy living out moments
you won't remember five years from now.

141
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,778
I know this because you post
about this life all the goddamn time.

142
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,326
Candidly, it's the least
appealing thing about you, Beck.

143
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
You posted this hours after our encounter.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,625
I was concerned you didn't mention
that cute guy in a bookstore.

145
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,503
And then I realized
your online life isn't real.

146
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,630
It's a collage.

147
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,840
You paste this Beck up. This...

148
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,219
together, lovable, cute,
bendy little creature.

149
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,846
If anything, the fact that
you didn't share me with your followers

150
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,307
only confirms we really connected.

151
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,894
The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

152
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,695
There it is, with its big, naked windows.

153
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,072
It's nice. Too nice.

154
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm thinking subsidized school housing.

155
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,079
Jesus! It's like you've never
seen a horror movie or the news.

156
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,005
But you want people to watch, don't you?

157
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,132
You know,
I plan on asking you about this quality

158
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,759
when we get to know each other better.

159
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,302
A proposal.

160
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,263
Why don't we
spend the day together tomorrow?

161
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,556
Just you and me?

162
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,684
To everyone out there
chasing their dreams, don't give up.

163
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,770
And in the meantime, mac and cheese!

164
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:30,278
It's cute. Not deep. But cute.
Is there more to you? Let's find out.

165
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
Our day starts at the ass-crack of dawn.

166
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,585
I know from your posted schedule
that you teach a 6:30 class

167
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,378
called Get Up N Flow.

168
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,133
You caress the sweaty backs of bulimic,
dead-eyed real mommies of SoHo...

169
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,677
I am loving your form today, Tasha.

170
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,388
...offering smiles
and lies of encouragement.

171
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,934
By 10:00, you're at campus
to TA a Romantics class

172
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,769
and play Vanna White to some shirt.

173
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,688
Morning, Professor Leahy.

174
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,858
I told you, it's Paul.
Are you ready for class?

175
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,484
Professor Obvious wants to fuck you.

176
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,739
Now, you're smart.
You let him think one day he might.

177
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,073
And what's the harm in that, right?

178
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,661
After class,
you head to your favorite café

179
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,289
to write for the first time all day.

180
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,249
But your life doesn't cooperate.

181
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,420
Your wealthy girlfriends
have just now woken up,

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,838
and have nothing better to do

183
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,175
than plan their next pointless
yet instagrammable night.

184
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,010
Can we get real for a second?

185
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,095
You have questionable taste in friends,
Beck.

186
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,312
- Cheers!
- Yeah!

187
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,939
- Oh, yes. Happy birthday!
- Thank you so much.

188
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,610
And expensive taste in lives.

189
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,195
-Ready?
-Thank you.

190
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,865
Do you like it?

191
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,160
No, I hate it. Of course I love it!

192
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,745
Jason didn't even
get her something that nice,

193
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,622
and Annika finally let him do anal.

194
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,667
- Oh, my God!
- Please, please, it was time.

195
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,920
Please open my gift next and tell me
how much you hate me then, lady.

196
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,513
A butterfly? It's my spirit animal
for the year. You remembered?

197
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,348
Only 'cause you wouldn't shut up about it.

198
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,351
You want so badly to be one of them.

199
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,727
- Happy birthday.
- You look so beautiful.

200
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
Well, they've got nothing to do
after this.

201
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,023
So, yeah, they'll party till 5:00
and scrape it together tomorrow.

202
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,567
But you can't.
You have to work for a living.

203
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,238
A McQueen, Beck? How much was it?

204
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,864
It was on clearance.

205
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
They haven't put a McQueen scarf
on clearance

206
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,618
since he hung himself in 2010.

207
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
It'd be too much
even if she did deserve it,

208
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,539
which she does not.

209
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,958
Hmm. Not all your friends are dumb.

210
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,418
You always do this.

211
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,046
You make, like, a big gesture
that you can't afford because...

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,218
- I'm sorry, you're too nice.
- It's no big deal. I had, um, a gift card.

213
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,595
How broke are you?

214
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,349
Just tell me what's up.

215
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
Actually sounds like she cares.

216
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,853
Look, I appreciate--

217
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,564
Why don't you just let me
loan you some cash?

218
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,566
Okay? I keep telling you, it's nothing.

219
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
Also, sounds condescending.

220
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,905
You know I'd do anything for you.
Don't forget that.

221
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,201
-Sure you can't come out with us?
-I gotta write.

222
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,036
Virtuous. Catch you later?

223
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,169
Is that the best friend you've got?

224
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,422
If so, Beck, you really are alone.

225
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,934
Your social media's a liar.

226
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,271
It says
you're a happy-go-lucky dilettante.

227
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,943
But, underneath it all,
you seem like the genuine article.

228
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,447
Stretched ADD thin, sure,
but as soon as the door closes...

229
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,782
you're back at the keyboard,
trying to write.

230
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,803
Thanks.

231
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,600
Keep the change, man.

232
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,772
Hey. Let me up.

233
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
Uh, Beck, who the fuck is this?

234
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
My best friend walked in
on you getting your dick sucked

235
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,998
by some random woman in a bathroom
at a party that I took you to!

236
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,042
I was wasted. I didn't even finish.

237
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,504
That's your apology? "I didn't cum."
That's the one you're going with?

238
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,047
I obviously shouldn't have gone
in the bathroom

239
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,298
with any girl that wasn't you.

240
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,261
But she said she had good coke,
and I'd been seriously stressed.

241
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,180
I thought,
when Johno and I started our line,

242
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
it was gonna be like
picking out flavors and shit.

243
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
It turns out it's 16-hour lectures
on microbial management.

244
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
And that's why no one starts
their own artisanal soda company,

245
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,566
and why America has to keep drinking crap
that's giving 'em cancer.

246
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,570
You actually managed to connect
your illicit blowjob to curing cancer.

247
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,406
I'm genuinely impressed.

248
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,910
Beck, I...

249
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,664
Seriously, I am drowning in work.

250
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:38,085
I don't have time to keep hooking up
or whatever it is you're even capable of.

251
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,965
I know I've done some stupid shit,
but I'm on it now.

252
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,262
I don't wanna be
just some guy you sleep with.

253
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,684
God, you make me insane.

254
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,859
Way to go, Beck.
Looks like a catch.

255
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,157
Benjamin J. Ashby III.
Oh, there's three of them.

256
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

257
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,579
His father is the Ben Ashby
of Ashby Brokerage.

258
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,373
Two failed careers. Model. Oh, boy.

259
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,833
And co-creator of a dating app

260
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,337
that connects people
through musical tastes called LoveHooks.

261
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,131
Current CEO of Home Soda
Artisanal Beverages.

262
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,132
Motto...

263
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,509
"Drink better by hand,"
which makes no sense,

264
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,844
but evokes a homespun quality

265
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,222
that lines up with a guy
who wears $600 Japanese sneakers.

266
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:37,061
The hair, the privilege he tries to hide
with retweets of Black Lives Matter.

267
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,649
Not to sound judgey, but this guy
is everything wrong with America.

268
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,903
See, this is why I do my research.

269
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,863
You fall for the wrong men.

270
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,531
Bad men.

271
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,076
You let them in. You let them hurt you.

272
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,662
Too far away to know for sure,
but my guess is,

273
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,455
if he came anywhere close
to making you cum,

274
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,791
you would've made a Broadway show
out of it.

275
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,126
But you didn't, 'cause he didn't.

276
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,677
-"Desperate Characters."
-Yeah, I just got it.

277
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,553
Borrow it when I'm done.
It's supposed to be her best.

278
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,138
Johno's consultant we brought in,

279
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,140
she's been all over me
about this kind of thing.

280
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,892
Saged the crap out of the office.

281
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,312
The book title
has the word "desperate" in it.

282
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,273
You don't want to think of yourself
as a desperate character, Beck.

283
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,987
Because you're the opposite, babe.

284
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,447
You're the smartest girl I know.

285
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,367
Honestly, you blow me away.

286
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,875
Oh, shit. Gotta roll.
Johno's blowing up my phone.

287
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,462
Hey, you should come by the office,
test out some new flavors.

288
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,382
We're doing cumin.
I know how much you like Indian food.

289
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,676
Sure. Sounds good.

290
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,594
It looks good on you, by the way.

291
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,056
The extra weight.

292
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,729
Yeah. Hey. I'm on my way, bro.

293
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,188
You guys ordering pizzas?

294
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,150
Yeah, don't dick me over like last time.
Gluten-free crust.

295
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,902
Not from that vegan place.
Vegan cheese tastes like asshole.

296
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm talking French gourmet shit.

297
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,002
No. Johno. Johno. Listen to me.

298
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,629
They can't do half-gluten-free
'cause it's dough.

299
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298
They have to use a spelt dough.

300
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,161
So you didn't finish.

301
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,821
Just like that.

302
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,379
Thank you. You're so kind.

303
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,006
I don't suppose you can
help me get a cab, can you?

304
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,967
Of course.

305
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,468
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

306
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,073
Wow. Don't tell me
you're finished already.

307
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
Almost.

308
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,701
It's so good.

309
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,911
Sometimes the dialogue's weird, though.

310
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,581
Like when they're killing each other
and still all nice about it.

311
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,709
Well, it was the 19th century.
People still had manners.

312
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
I was hoping we could go get another one.

313
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,550
I mean, it's pretty late, Pac.
I don't know.

314
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, yeah.

315
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,013
I want you to cum...

316
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,264
Something's
in the air tonight, Beck,

317
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,642
'cause everyone but me is getting action.

318
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,895
Even the lovebirds made up.

319
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,647
Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure.

320
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,611
Did you know
Dumas was a black dude? I googled him.

321
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,655
His grandmother was a slave,
and his dad was a brigadier general.

322
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,407
He killed like half a battalion.

323
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,493
You probably knew that
since you work at a bookstore.

324
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,120
I didn't.

325
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
-How'd you get to work here, anyway?
-Mr. Mooney gave me a job

326
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,250
when I was just a little older than you.
He sort of took me in.

327
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,252
-He seems nice.
-He's a dick.

328
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,381
But he loved books,
and he taught me to love them, too.

329
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
I never see him around here.

330
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,594
-Is he dead?
-No. He's just old.

331
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,887
I'm sorry, Pac.

332
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,348
I had one back here for you,
but Ethan must've sold it.

333
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,100
-Sold what?
-Your next read.

334
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,852
Come on. I'll show you
where we keep the good stuff.

335
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,411
Freaky.

336
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
It's the Cage.

337
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,255
It's where we keep
early editions and collectibles.

338
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,881
It's cold.

339
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,259
Sixty-five degrees. For the books.

340
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,719
If the zombies come,
this is where I'm hiding.

341
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
Why don't you set that milkshake down?

342
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,202
Careful, Joseph.

343
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,708
When it comes to the value of a book,
it's all about condition. I'll show you.

344
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,084
It's always 65 degrees.

345
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,797
Humidity 40%.
Too moist, the pages can mildew...

346
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
Too dry, they get brittle.

347
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,759
Always keep books upright

348
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,054
so the spines don't become rolled
or warped or what we call "cocked."

349
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,224
And we never wanna
fold or crease the pages.

350
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,019
And we dust the covers
with a chemical-free duster.

351
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,603
Always towards the spine.

352
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,065
Under no circumstances
is there any sunlight in this room.

353
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
Sunlight can ruin a book as fast as fire.

354
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,944
Faster.

355
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,865
That's a lot of stuff to remember
just to take care of some old books.

356
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,827
The most valuable things in life
are usually...

357
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
the most helpless.

358
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,626
So they need people like us
to protect them. You know?

359
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,301
"Don Quicks-oat."

360
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,054
Quixote.
It's about a guy who believes in chivalry,

361
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,972
so he decides to be an old-school knight.

362
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,140
What's chivalry?

363
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,602
It's treating people with respect.
Especially women. Like men should.

364
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,312
It's good. It's one of my favorites.

365
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,023
I probably shouldn't take this home.

366
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,649
It's not a first edition,
it's just an old one.

367
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,276
Besides, I trust you.

368
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,463
-Where you been, Paco?
-We just grabbed some milkshakes.

369
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,966
-You just walk off with strangers?
-Joe's not a stranger.

370
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
Yes, he is.

371
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,261
Inside. Now. Okay?

372
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,188
Keep away from my girlfriend's kid.

373
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,317
Look, I'm sorry, but he was out here,
and he could hear everything in there.

374
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,610
Don't you tell me how to parent.

375
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,655
This whole nice guy act
might work on other people.

376
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,699
I'm a parole officer, 15 years,
and I can see what you are.

377
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,202
Well, you're an alcoholic shitbag
who beats women.

378
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,454
So, please, enlighten me.

379
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,581
You're a freak.

380
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,584
So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

381
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,962
I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

382
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,716
There are scary people
in the world, Beck.

383
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,677
That's why it's important to be safe.

384
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,434
And why I have to do what I'm about to do.

385
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
Fun fact.

386
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,698
Did you know the law requires
gas leaks to be investigated?

387
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,241
I've been learning a lot since I met you.

388
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
Hey, Beck? You left the door open again.

389
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,620
I thought we said
we weren't gonna do that anymore.

390
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
I was careful to call the gas company
on a day when you had a full schedule.

391
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,916
I wouldn't wanna scare you.

392
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,793
Hey. Is Beck here?

393
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,212
Nope. Super let me in.
Someone reported a leak.

394
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,131
Right. Yeah. She mentioned that.
Is everything okay?

395
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,884
Yeah, all clear.
Tell your girlfriend there's no leak.

396
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,468
I'm done, so...

397
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,762
Okay. Thanks. Well, I can just lock up.

398
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
I just need to know who you really are.

399
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,813
Besides a broke poetry student

400
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,441
in a subsidized apartment
you could never afford.

401
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,610
Where is it, Beck?

402
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,905
When we live together,
your place won't be a pigsty.

403
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,031
I'll clean for us.

404
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,912
And you won't eat all this frozen shit.
I'll cook for you every day. I promise.

405
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
I'll even do your laundry.

406
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,465
And take care of your favorite books.

407
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
I'll make our bed every morning.

408
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
Oh, there it is.

409
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,183
And no matter how hard you fight me,

410
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,062
I will always make sure
you password protect your devices.

411
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,735
"One day
You won't need love anymore

412
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,404
One day, you won't walk through the world

413
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,782
As though it was your job
To hold everything up

414
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,619
The sun, the sky
The hard part of the night"

415
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,746
It's good.

416
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,290
It's quite good.

417
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,378
But, Beck, where's the rest?
You owe me 20 more pages.

418
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:51,132
I've been, honestly,
working every day, and grading papers--

419
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,051
If the schedule is too rigorous,
drop back to part-time.

420
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,803
But then I won't qualify to TA.

421
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,430
I need the cash. The housing.
I'd lose my place.

422
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,516
You'll figure it out.
You're smart, or you wouldn't be here.

423
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,643
-Please, Professor Leahy--
-Paul.

424
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,981
Paul. I'll get you the pages
by the end of the week.

425
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,651
I can't go to part-time, okay?

426
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,572
I'm rooting for you.

427
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,492
You just need to keep up.

428
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,371
Happy to discuss further.
After class some evening.

429
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,832
If we're gonna seriously discuss poetry,
it should be over a drink.

430
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,959
There's a little gastropub I love...

431
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,753
I would love that, Paul.

432
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,173
Just, uh, how would your wife feel
about you--

433
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,886
About me helping out an aspiring writer?
She's used to my generosity.

434
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,931
So, Thursday night, then?

435
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,435
Thursday night it is.

436
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,436
Excellent.

437
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,815
And don't worry about the next few days.
Just go home and get caught up.

438
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,369
Need to see you tonight.

439
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
Will if I can, babe.
Working late.

440
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,295
P.S., I can still smell you on my fingers.

441
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,215
I learned two definitive things
by scouring your computer.

442
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,428
First, there are no recent pictures
of your dad because he's dead.

443
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,264
He OD'd and you were the one
that found him.

444
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,226
You've started a few poems about that day,
but you never finished them.

445
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,228
I'm so sorry, Beck.

446
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,274
But none of this matters because of
my second and greatest discovery.

447
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,652
11:06 a.m., an hour after
our encounter at the bookstore,

448
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
amidst a group text on the merits
of vaginal detoxing, you wrote...

449
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,660
Wow. Just met a human male
who actually reads.

450
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,287
Alert the media.

451
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,207
What if it's finally time for me
to date someone good for me?

452
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,292
Thank you for letting me know

453
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,960
I wasn't crazy after all.

454
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,878
No!

455
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,507
Yes, I remember what you said
when you sent money last.

456
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,259
Yes, I'm grateful.

457
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,932
I'm working constantly.
There's no place cheaper to live.

458
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,105
I did.
He basically offered to sleep with me.

459
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
No, I can't report him.
That's not how it works.

460
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm not worried.
I've seen enough romantic comedies

461
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,237
to know guys like me
are always getting in jams like this.

462
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,323
Not the school, the world.
That's not how the world works.

463
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,745
I know how much you helped me,
it's just... It's hard here, Mom.

464
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,419
Okay. I'll figure it out.

465
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,587
All right. Love you, too.

466
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,047
Bye, Mom.

467
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,727
It's okay, Beck.

468
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,404
Hi, Becks.

469
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,073
Hey, bitch, where you at? Come play!

470
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,617
I can't. I just had the worst day.

471
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,661
-What happened?
-Aw. Beckalicious, whatever it is,

472
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,912
there's nothing that we can't fix, okay?

473
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,914
Yes, us and copious amounts of alcohol.

474
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,167
Oh, my God. There's a sale!

475
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,337
- You guys love me?
- Of course.

476
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,422
- Why would you even say that?
- Okay, then.

477
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,466
Meet me in Greenpoint.

478
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,469
Look, why don't you come here?
Okay? Come here.

479
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,595
It's actually really fun
where we are.

480
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,554
- No.
- I promise.

481
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,513
Yeah.

482
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,807
There's something I need to do for myself.

483
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,725
I'll text you on my way.

484
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,809
See you soon.

485
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,727
-Bye!
-Bye!

486
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,188
Fuck!

487
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,694
I guess we're going
to Greenpoint, Beck.

488
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,789
I never go to Greenpoint.

489
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,749
But the things you do for love, right?

490
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,753
Hi. Um, okay, we're gonna get
a few more drinks.

491
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,962
Hold on, one second.

492
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,714
Guys?

493
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,841
What is she thinking?

494
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,220
Open mics are for models-slash-
singer-songwriters-slash-vegans.

495
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,221
These people don't want to hear

496
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,182
some wannabe read a poem
about the bleakness of life or whatever.

497
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:13,686
Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the worst.

498
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,150
- Ooh.
- Another round of picklebacks.

499
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,611
Beckish, do we think now's the night?

500
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,154
Positive.

501
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,448
All of my life lately
has been about surviving.

502
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,743
I need to remind myself
why I came here in the first place.

503
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,828
-Yes.
-Yeah.

504
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,496
-You go. So good.
-Who do you keep texting?

505
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,122
I invited Benji.

506
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,000
-Beck...
-What? He likes poetry.

507
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,836
-For sure.
-And he texted he was coming?

508
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,091
He texted a row of smile emojis,
like, 45 minutes ago.

509
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,552
Some guys are assholes,
and you just have to realize that.

510
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,845
I get it, Peach.

511
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,806
You're the one who told me
to keep reminding you he's a bastard.

512
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,892
Up next, we have Guinevere Beck.

513
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,185
Whoo!

514
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,062
-All right.
-All right.

515
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,565
To vulnerability and shit!

516
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,649
Yeah.

517
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,317
-Cheers.
-Okay.

518
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,986
- Okay.
- Okay.

519
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,279
Kill it, Beck!

520
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:10,034
Hey, everyone. Um, I'm Beck, and I'm...

521
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,537
Not to sound like, you know,
whatever, but just...

522
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,914
I'm a poet.

523
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,124
Yeah, you are!

524
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,834
Whoo!

525
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,877
Yeah, you are!

526
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,257
"One day, you won't need love anymore

527
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,093
One day, you won't walk through the world

528
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,971
As though it was your job
To hold everything up

529
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,641
The sun, the hard part of the night

530
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,561
The secret time when you wake
To the sound of beating

531
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,397
Rise to answer the door
But he's not there

532
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,858
Because that sound is coming
From inside you

533
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,361
And you cannot answer it
No matter how far in you go"

534
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,243
Whoo!

535
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:56,205
"You loved him the way
Fragile kids love gorgeous bullies

536
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,460
You wrote songs about him. You..."

537
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,794
Uh, I mean...

538
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,505
"You wrote poems about him

539
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,177
You still write poems about him
You're writing one right now"

540
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,014
Why're you so sad?
You're just so sad.

541
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,517
Just something happier, for a change,
might be nice.

542
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,146
I think everyone agrees.
Get the singer back.

543
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,067
Sorry. I just...
I lost my place.

544
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,653
It'll just take a second
to find where I was.

545
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,614
I can't stand seeing this.
I'm sorry. I just can't.

546
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,576
It's obvious what you are.
You're blind with love.

547
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,913
And what you love, writing,
this city, your friends,

548
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,414
most of all, men like Benji,

549
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,376
what all those have in common
is they will never love you back.

550
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,336
While you give everything.

551
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,674
It's crazy the lengths we go.
We're a lot alike, Beck.

Mr. Bat-Shit Homeless Guy,

happened.

Could it really be?

559
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,533

563

And you're too wasted

Oh, the... Right.
Of course.

603
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,848
I remember. I'm sorry.

604
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,977

Yeah. No, I... I remember.

606
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,940
It's okay, I have a pretty bland face.

No, you don't.

608

609
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,491
Yeah.

610
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,743
Where are you headed?

611
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,163
Village. You anywhere close?

612
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,541
Ride with me. It's the least I can do.

613
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,544
Okay.

614
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,894
Did you move here to be something?
I did. But it's not working out.

615
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,230
And I'm just running around
18 hours a day. Why?

616
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,735
Oh, God! Never mind. Sorry.

617
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,322
No, please. I feel the same way sometimes.

618
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,533
This guy I know, he owns the bookstore.

619
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:49,081
He once told me that all books
add up to one essential truth.

620
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,168
Which is,
if your IQ is above a certain number...

621
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,673
life is pretty much unbearable.
And the number is not even that high.

622
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,012
I do think
I'd be happier if I was stupider.

623
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,390
But then the world
wouldn't know your poetry.

00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,601
How'd you know I write poetry?

625
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,481
Doesn't every young writer in New York?

626
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,317
I mean, I read a lot of poetry.

627
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,112
Who do you like?

628
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,616
Strand, Sexton, Merrill...

629
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,993
You're describing my nightstand.

630
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,538
Well, if you read them
to get to sleep every night,

631
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,582
then you definitely belong here.

632
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,671
-What was your last name again?
-Goldberg.

633
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,633
Where did you come from, Joe Goldberg?

634
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,718
I grew up here.

635
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,640
I left for a little while. Chasing a girl.

636
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,935
-But you came back?
-Yeah, I missed it.

637
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
And I'm not a good chaser.

638
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,648
Me neither.

639
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,755
Oh, this is, uh... This is me.

640
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,383
Mmm-hmm. It's not bad.

641
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,677
Thank you for sobering me up.

642
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,263
And for saving my life.

643
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,724
No, I didn't...
I didn't save your life.

644
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,933
Yeah, you did.

645
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,069
Oh, God.

646
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,738
Of course.

647
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,781
- Benji.
- Hi.

648
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,786
Um, this is Joe.
He literally saved my life tonight.

649
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,123
I... I fell on the tracks. It was crazy.

650
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,625
Babe, I told you
people are basically good.

651
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,794
It's a great job, bro.

652
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,505
"Bro." You waste of hair.

653
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,133
Okay. Beck, it's freezing out here.

654
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:13,434
-Wait. Maybe I can get your info...
-Yeah. Um...

655
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,731
Shit!

656
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,484
My phone!

657
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,779
-I must've dropped it in the subway.
-Oh.

658
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,241
Uh, okay, well.
Just maybe give me your number,

659
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,826
for when you get a replacement.

660
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,329
I'm basically enslaved to e-mail.

661
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,291
I get it. Smart. I'm practically
a stranger. Can't be too careful.

662
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,584
Okay.

663
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,587
It's BeckInRealLife@gmail.com

664
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,839
All right.

665
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,385
"Beck in real life."

666
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
Thank you.

667
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,433
Here's what I learned this week.

668
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,476
Sorry I didn't make it, you know?

669
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,146
You are special. You're talented.
You're passionate.

670
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,524
You're smart.

671
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,572
Except in the ways you are really not.
Like not locking your phone.

672
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:12,576
And falling for men like Benji.
You know better, but you can't stop.

673
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,830
Because, well,
because everyone needs someone.

674
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,082
What you really need
is someone to save you.

675
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,419
I can help, Beck.
Let me help you.

676
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
Joe.

677
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
Pac. Hey.

678
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,473
What's going on?
What're you doing out here?

679
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,016
It's Ron.

680
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,103
He came home drunk.

681
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
He started yelling.

682
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,607
Saying I thought I was smart,

683
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,193
reading my books
and looking at him like he's dumb.

684
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
What happened? Did he hurt you?

685
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,323
No, he didn't touch me.

686
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,793
I tried to stop him...

687
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,212
-I'm sorry.
-Paco.

688
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,633
Paco, it's okay. Really. It's okay.

689
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,595
You know what? Come with me.
We can fix this together. All right?

690
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,227
So, the first step to fixing something

691
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,899
is to know no matter how destroyed
it seems, it can always be saved.

692
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
Books are no exception. You got it?

693
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,155
Got it.

694
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,117
So what we have here is a lying press.
Basically just a huge clamp.

695
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,328
Polyvinyl-acetate glue,

696
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,415
means no acid to burn the pages.
Got your needle, thread,

697
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,502
and finally, right out of Bugs Bunny...

698
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,795
a trusty mallet.

699
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,590
You see this?

700
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
We don't need this.

701
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,892
Johno! Listen to this.

702
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,228
"Dear Benji, heard about your soda.

703
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,688
Am interested in including you
on my fall list of must-tries.

704
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,025
Would love to discuss.
Perhaps even try some? Jeff Pevensey."

705
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,318
That's the dude you're always retweeting?

706
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,654
It's the culture guy
from New York magazine.

707
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,241
Hit him back, bro.

708
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,202
No shit. Back off while I think.

709
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,748
Jeff, comma, so nice to hear
from you, bud, period.

710
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,167
Yeah, our sodas are legit, period.

711
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,420
I would love to meet up
to have you try the goods, period.

712
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,422
Let's set something up.

713
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,972
Scrape carefully along the spine.

714
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,266
Of course,
you've got to watch your fingers.

715
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,025
"Sounds great. I can call between meetings
to see if you're available."

716
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,736
This is gonna take us next level.

717
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,862
What time do you think we'll meet?

718
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,617
No offense, we discussed this.

719
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,037
It's best if the product has
one clear face at the beginning.

720
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,914
That's just more me.

721
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
Okay, the spine is sewn.

722
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,921
So you take this,
pull it as tight as you can, that way.

723
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,799
Yeah. That's it.

724
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,892
Jeff!

725
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,979
The glue is set. We've applied the binder.

726
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,063
Now...

727
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,653
you gotta be precise,
and use exactly the force needed.

728
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,000
Hey!

729
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,961
Hey, man. Jeff. Nice to meet you, man.

730
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,339
Nice to meet you, too.
Have you been here before?

731
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,549
It's a...
Not a lot of people know about it yet.

732
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,386
It's an incredible after-hours.
Very exclusive.

733
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,056
Yeah, I've been here a couple of times.

734
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,724
-Yeah?
-Hmm.

735
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,934
Oh. Well, good.

736
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,355
So you'll feel right at home, then.

737
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
Please, after you.

738
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:19,948
All right.

739
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,915
It's just down. To the left.

740
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,056
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

741
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,373
It's 2:00 p.m. when the door chimes,
and I'm ready.

742
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,921
You told your girlfriends you'd come by.
I know this because I have your phone.

743
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,464
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

744
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,299
Hey.

745
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:24,012
Remember me? From almost dying
on the train tracks?

746
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,224
Uh, it rings a bell. Hang on. Hang on.

747
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,226
I wanted to say thank you.

748
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,145
No. You already did that.

749
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,730
Well, uh, thanks again.

750
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,985
And I'm sorry for, uh, running off
the other night.

751
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,321
-You had a guest.
-Hardly.

752
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,118
So, I got you a present.

753
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,661
No, please.
You don't have to get me anything.

754
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,163
Shut up and just look at it.

755
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,005
"Engine, engine number nine
On the New York transit line

756
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,675
If your girl falls on the track
Pick her up, pick her up, pick her up"

757
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,261
We already have in-jokes.

758
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,554
So...

759
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,142
anyway, that. And I better--

760
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:15,147
Maybe if you're not too busy,
we could get a drink sometime?

761
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,232
Sure.

762
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,277
Ugh. But I still can't find my phone.

763
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404
I know. E-mail.

764
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,615
That's right.

765
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,453
See ya, Joe.

766
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
See you soon, Beck.

767
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,007
Well played, sir.

768
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,092
Well played.

769
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm not always right. I'm human.
I make mistakes.

770
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,848
You'll see.

771
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,767
I have to check on a shipment downstairs.

772
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,186
-Can you watch the register?
-Yeah.

773
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,315
Hell, maybe
I'm just a fool in love...

774
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,193
but I'm right about you,

775
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,321
and I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve, Beck.

776
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,837
Please.

777
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,676
Whatever you think I did,
you got the wrong guy.

778
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,302
No.

779
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,389
I don't.
