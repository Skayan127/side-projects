1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,261
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,681
There are no recent pictures
of your dad because he's dead.

3
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,642
He OD'd and you were the one
that found him.

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,354
You've started a few poems about that day,
but you never finished them.

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,981
I have one just like this.

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,649
It was my dad's.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,861
This is the red ladle story?

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,779
It's okay, Beck.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,532
I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve.

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,743
You fall for the wrong men.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,830
You have questionable taste in friends,
and that Peach is the worst.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,875
I just need to know who you really are.

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,710
Besides a broke poetry student

14
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,254
in a subsidized apartment
you could never afford.

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,548
What you really need
is someone to save you.

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,675
Let me help you, Beck.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,510
Beck, is it? Blythe.

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,763
I read one of your essays
in the Review last month,

19
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,390
and it was so illuminating.

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,769
That's funny. There's a book missing.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,022
Joe was looking at it at my party.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,025
Tonight, I show you I'm the one.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,945
You want it down and dirty? You got it.

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,658
Did you just...

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,088
Did you just...

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,191
What was that?

27
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,819
Eight seconds?

28
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,740
Oh, yeah. He's got that
"Trump just took Pennsylvania" look.

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,909
Say something.

30
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,162
Say, "Happens all the time. NBD."

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,540
No, you'll sound like a slut.

32
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,252
You could say, "Let's order food."
Move past it.

33
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,420
Is Grey Dog open late?

34
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,589
Oh, thank God.

35
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,591
Um...

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,802
-I should...
-Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,433
Shit.

38
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,353
Ugh, you idiot.

39
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,272
Why did you tell him
you were available this weekend?

40
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,565
Why don't you think?

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
Well, go.

42
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,653
The Captain calls, you answer.

43
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,071
You know how this works.

44
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,366
He paid for the bed you just got laid on.

45
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,410
Or whatever that was.

46
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,287
And your phone bill.

47
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,837
Good girl. That wasn't so hard, was it?

48
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,175
Seriously?

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,974
Seriously?

50
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,191
Hey, Beck,
I'm gonna run to the store.

51
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,236
Shit. Joe. Probably thinks
you're hiding in here.

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,363
Hold on a second. I'll be right out.

53
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,743
Oh, God, please stop.

54
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,120
They're just words, Beck.

55
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,332
Tell him what he wants to hear.

56
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,965
Oh, no.

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,302
Joe?

58
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,313
Ugh, Beck. You're a disaster.

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,654
Last night, eight-second sex. Joe.

60
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,705
If you're gonna act like a whore,
may as well look like one.

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,675
You just have a magic poon.

62
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,677
Hashtag, yoni too good.

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,054
Thanks. That's helpful.

64
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,099
Is he big?

65
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,894
"Is he big?" Oh, my God.
Why are you even asking them?

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,190
Can you, for once,
just have your own opinion, Beck?

67
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,942
Got pics?

68
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,656
With the bun?

69
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,742
You're not helping.

70
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,666
Is he worth it?

71
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,084
"Is he worth it?"

72
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,337
There we go. Good question.

73
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,755
Is he?

74
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,803
Annika wouldn't know a good dick
if you hit her over the head with it.

75
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,805
It's not like it doesn't happen
to tons of guys.

76
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,225
I mean, Benji used to nod off
while going down on me.

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,602
I thought we weren't talking
about Benji anymore.

78
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,854
We're not.

79
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,441
He's dead to me.
Just merely using him as a reference.

80
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,443
Benji didn't work retail.

81
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,819
Joe works in a bookstore.

82
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,446
A hop, skip, and a bad haircut away

83
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,990
from selling men's leather bracelets
at Club Monaco.

84
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,160
Becks, love yourself. Ghost him, already.

85
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,582
Sorry to interrupt, ladies,
but we are all clear.

86
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,169
- Are you saying I don't have bedbugs?
- I didn't find a one.

87
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,296
Would you like to see
the 22 bites on my ass?

88
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,006
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.

89
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,591
They're there. Go find them.

90
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,217
Go find them!

91
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,013
Ugh. I wonder how he is
with finding rare books.

92
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,307
Joe did not take your Wizard of Oz.

93
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,933
Ozma of Oz.

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,727
And who said anything about Joe?

95
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,605
That's it. I'm booking a room
at the Mandarin Oriental

96
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,856
and you're coming with.

97
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,901
I would so love to, but I can't.

98
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,943
I, um...

99
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,615
I am going to a writer's retreat
in Rockland.

100
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,532
Since when?

101
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,242
She knows when you're lying.

102
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:13,539
Since I wrote this piece in workshop
that everyone called "treacly."

103
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,751
Tell me you're not writing
another dead puppy thing

104
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,753
as a metaphor for your dad dying.

105
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,129
-I--
-What?

106
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,507
That's completely what it's really about.

107
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,052
Look, I'm just saying
stop killing puppies.

108
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,595
Write fresh.

109
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,263
You know, there's so much more
inside of you.

110
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,681
Who are you now, Beckalish?

111
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,060
-Hmm?
-I thought it was a good piece.

112
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,521
Aw...

113
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
Sorry, boo-boo. Okay, go.

114
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,699
Find that brilliant badass
inside of you, and believe in her.

115
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,201
I know I do.

116
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,497
Literally, the most supportive
she's ever been about your writing,

117
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,832
and you're lying to her face.

118
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,960
You are the worst friend.

119
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,171
Oh, there they are.

120
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,511
Wait a minute. Why do you need these
if you're going on a writer's retreat?

121
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,014
What?
So, it's look hot or be a writer?

122
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,655
You could just leave.
You could, you know.

123
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,033
Cut the cord. Take off the yoke.
Bon voyage, Captain.

124
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,079
You're a coward.

125
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,417
Britney got through 2007, though, right?

126
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,631
Maybe this is what you need
to find your inner badass.

127
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,801
Maybe Emily Dickinson had it right.

128
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,804
The solitary prowess of a silent life.

129
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,943
What is it with motel rooms
and you wanting to dive into your panties?

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,740
He is always late.
And you're frustrated.

131
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,576
Plus, after last night, you're owed one.

132
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,663
Oh, Joe. You seriously need to call him.

133
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,888
Has he been working out?

134
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,978
It's two days. You got this.

135
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
Did you just...

136
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,424
You should be screaming
my name right now,

137
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,552
digging your nails into my back.

138
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,721
You expected me to please you,
get you off,

139
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,016
but you didn't scream,
and my back is not bleeding,

140
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,561
and you definitely did not get off.

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,188
You don't even know what to say, do you?

142
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
You must be mortified.

143
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,319
Ignore it. Ignore it, Beck.

144
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,655
What the hell have I done?

145
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,950
Seriously?

146
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,119
You're already telling
whoever that is.

147
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,580
I've reduced myself to an anecdote.

148
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,374
Mr. Quickdraw. The Minuteman.

149
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,543
Being generous.

150
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,546
Don't let it be Peach.

151
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,094
"The Captain"?

152
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,722
What the hell is this?

153
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,519
What? Obviously, you don't love him.

154
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,146
Love ya!

155
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,530
"Love ya."

156
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,074
"Love ya"?

157
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:23,039
You never said that to Benji,
and look what had to happen to him.

158
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,628
Beck, just when I think
we're getting somewhere...

159
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,596
Yeah, so, here,
you're sacrificing the hard cover,

160
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,474
but you're getting greater textual
accuracy than any previous edition.

161
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,435
It's the final word
on the Tolkien trilogy.

162
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,561
Thank you so much.

163
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,774
My dick reduced
to cartoon food items.

164
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,194
This is my nightmare. A hot dog.

165
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,987
Yes, with the bun.

166
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,907
Tell her, Beck.

167
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,534
Go on, listen to your gut.

168
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,119
Joe's the one.

169
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,707
Yes. Worth it. Okay, one more shot.

170
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,334
Not like there was any real doubt.

171
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,380
"Outfit"? Are you kidding me?

172
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,840
Just got it. Hope you like.

173
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,809
You do all this for him?

174
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,854
Christoph's party
in Montauk tonight. You in?

175
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,439
Can't. Gotta write.

176
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,901
You even lie to your friends
about this guy. What the hell?

177
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,115
You've been confirmed
at the Seahorse Motel.

178
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,619
Ethan, I need you to close tonight.

179
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,122
Oh, man, I'd love to,
but I gotta split soon.

180
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,500
Rastiche, my balalaika teacher,
is holding a master class tonight.

181
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,709
Wasn't a question.

182
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,045
I'm sorry.
I have an appointment out of town.

183
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,344
Beck, I should be your Captain.

184
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,787
It can't be.

185
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,915
How old is he?

186
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,505
If only I could tell you I'm here.
You don't need to do this.

187
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,259
Whatever this is,
it's not too late to stop it.

188
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,887
-So good to see you, hon.
-Yeah. You, too, Dad.

189
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,514
"Dad"?

190
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,981
Place belongs to a couple
from church.

191
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,860
There are plenty of rooms,
and it's ours right through New Years.

192
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,029
Sounds like a pretty cool place.

193
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,864
Even has a hot tub out on the patio.

194
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,826
Though, if I know Nancy,
she won't let the kids near it.

195
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,205
She doesn't normally want the kids
near me, either, but here we are.

196
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,499
I really think
you'd love it up there, honey.

197
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,959
Yeah, um...

198
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,962
I don't know my schedule
that far out, unfortunately.

199
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,216
Of course, I...

200
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,134
I understand.

201
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,221
And you wonder
why he asks for more.

202
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,138
Um...

203
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,976
But I'll totally check,
and I'll let you know as soon as possible.

204
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,365
What? Is it too much
for a Dickens festival?

205
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,449
No, no.

206
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,700
I mean...

207
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,286
It's just, some people may find it...
You know?

208
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,997
How is Nancy?

209
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,137
Why is he your secret, Beck?

210
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,435
"...has only one fault that I know of.

211
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,023
And it happens, unfortunately, that
that single blemish is a want of taste.

212
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,275
She don't like me."

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,155
It's pretty great, huh, sweetie?

214
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,032
Yeah, it's amazing.

215
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,745
Amazing this many people are fans
of contrived plotting and melodrama,

216
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,289
if they even read Dickens.

217
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,875
More likely they couldn't pass up
an excuse to day-drink.

218
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,251
How's your mom?

219
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,130
Um... she's actually... She's on a cruise,
but she's great.

220
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,049
Riddled with anxiety, low self-esteem,
on antidepressants,

221
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,970
dating men so safe and boring
she must wanna scream, but don't worry.

222
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,472
You abandoning her didn't scar her at all.

223
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,266
How about your brother?
How's he doing?

224
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,352
You know. Works a lot. Anya, too.

225
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,146
But they seem happy.

226
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,814
According to Facebook.

227
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,858
And how's school goin'?

228
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,193
It's great, actually. I'm...

229
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,821
I'm just working on building my portfolio.

230
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,032
It's more than just that first book.

231
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,200
You really need the second if--

232
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,493
Hey, where are you guys?

233
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,955
Beck, you're such an asshole.

234
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,416
"Love me, Daddy.
I'm gonna be a writer, Daddy."

235
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,835
God, just shut up forever.

236
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,878
There they are.

237
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,716
Oh, my God.

238
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,635
She's actually gotten more smug.

239
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,261
Beck, look, I have a cane.

240
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,181
Yes, you do. Look at you guys.

241
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
You look pretty.

242
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,187
Stop hating them.
They're just kids.

243
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,563
None of it's their fault.

244
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,731
Thanks, Mia. So do you.

245
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,319
Guinevere, how are you?

246
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,238
Great. I love your dress.

247
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,491
Not necessarily you in it, but...

248
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,784
Brought you something.

249
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,077
I just couldn't resist.

250
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,329
- No, she's not.
- Oh...

251
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,501
Oh, it's perfect.
Oh, um...

252
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,003
You're slipping a bit, dear.

253
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,507
Touch me again, crazy-pants.
I dare you.

254
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,549
Thank you.

255
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,553
Hey, Nancy, let's take the kids
and play a game.

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,180
As long as I get to...

257
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,724
You really are capable
of keeping a secret.

258
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,851
Four, by my count.

259
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,313
Who the hell are you, Beck?

260
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
Have at it.

261
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,657
Hey! Yeah. You're a natural.

262
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,368
Two down, buddy.

263
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,163
What an arm on him.

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
Maybe you should
get a shot for the blog.

265
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,506
If I wasn't so blinded by love,

266
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,550
I would've seen these secrets
right in front of me,

267
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,676
waiting to be uncovered.

268
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:56,849
Captain Beck, a.k.a. The Captain,
a.k.a. Edward Martin Beck.

269
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,811
The addict part was true, I see,
but he never died,

270
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,898
which he credits to his friends
in the NA fellowship at St. James Church.

271
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,527
It was there he not only
conquered his demons,

272
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,030
but also met church rep
and divorcée Nancy Whitesell,

273
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,908
a.k.a. the Christian News'
"Mommy Blogger of the Year."

274
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,579
"If Ned can do it, so can you."

275
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,206
He became a feature in her blog,
then her life.

276
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,168
Less than a year, they were married.

277
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,588
He really landed himself
the perfect family,

278
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,174
if your stepmother's to be believed.

279
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,134
But what about you, Beck?

280
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,011
Where do you fit into all this?

281
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,489
Your father has come such a long way.

282
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,908
Worked hard for it, too.

283
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,451
You're barking up
the wrong tree, lady,

284
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,661
if you think I'm gonna sit here
and validate that man.

285
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,956
Yeah, he's lucky to have you.

286
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,250
It just goes to show you

287
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,128
what a good Christian household
and a loving family can do.

288
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,339
She did not just suggest
if you were more Christian,

289
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,800
he wouldn't have abandoned you
for a crack pipe.

290
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,302
Mommy, come watch me.

291
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,513
Excuse me, my dear.

292
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,316
Your dad talk to you yet?

293
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,736
She's so her mother.
Only less subtle.

294
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,904
Talk to me about?

295
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,908
Well, he's supposed to tell you
he can't send money anymore.

296
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,870
But he's gonna help you
find a better job first.

297
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,705
Mom doesn't think he should wait.

298
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,749
She's so cranky.

299
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,835
It's the hormones.

300
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,671
Oh.

301
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,799
I wasn't supposed to tell you, but...

302
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,925
she's pregnant.

303
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,803
That's why they're fighting about it.

304
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,555
Great. It's great.

305
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,390
He's starting a new family...

306
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,311
because fixing the one he had
obviously wasn't an option.

307
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,523
Why would he ever do that?

308
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,445
I'm going to find a bathroom.
I'll be right back.

309
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,039
Can I get another "Timber Doodle"?

310
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
Bitch.

311
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,195
Hi. Is Joe Goldberg working today?

312
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:01,533
Joe Goldberg is not working today,
but I'm Ethan. And you would be...

313
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,952
Looking for Joe. Expect him anytime soon?

314
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,748
I do not, relatively speaking.
Joe's out of town.

315
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,666
But is there anything I can help you find?

316
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,667
Possibly.

317
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,588
I'm in the market for a first edition copy
of Ozma of Oz.

318
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,590
That's a pretty rare critter.

319
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,050
Uh, not sure we have it.

320
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,720
See, books of that pedigree,
we keep under a lock and key downstairs.

321
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,472
And you don't have the key?

322
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,477
Well, normally I have the key,
but I just don't have it right now.

323
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,562
Joe left with it.
He just forgot to give it to me.

324
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,022
And where is Joe?

325
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,278
I thought I was supposed to be writing.

326
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,738
Are you with "Eight Seconds"?

327
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,157
No. I told you, I'm on a retreat.

328
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,325
Is he with you?

329
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,828
What is it, Ethan?

330
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,581
Hey, bro. I know
you didn't want to be interrupted,

331
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,918
but this chick was just in
asking about a first ed. Ozma of Oz.

332
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,378
What are you talking about?

333
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,255
Joe's there. In Nyack.

334
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,506
What did she look like?

335
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,342
Uh, twenty-five-ish, brunette, kinda hot,

336
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,511
but, you know,
maybe that's like a type thing?

337
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,804
Peach Salinger.

338
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,222
Are you lying to me?

339
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,974
'Course you are.
That's what you do.

340
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,684
Lie so your life looks better.

341
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,562
Peach, I'm not lying.
I told you, I'm here to write. I...

342
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,983
I can't deal with this right now.
I promise I'll call you.

343
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,150
And you told her I'm here?

344
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
I'm sorry, man,
did I screw up or...

345
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,114
You'll know I'm here.
You may already know.

346
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,156
Hey, you.

347
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,826
Oh, sorry. So sorry.

348
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,577
How is this explainable?

349
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
Or do I run? Shit, shit, shit.

350
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,344
Joe?

351
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,473
Beck? What are you doing here?

352
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,610
That's true.
You are a bookseller, aren't you?

353
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,656
Sadly, I humiliate myself
like this annually.

354
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,783
Well, this is kinda workin' for you.

355
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,202
You mock.

356
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,579
It's fair.

357
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,086
I'm lying. I'm lying to you right now.

358
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,254
Excuse me?

359
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,714
I knew you were here.

360
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,217
I wasn't happy with how we left things,
and, apparently, neither were you,

361
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,053
seeing as how you were hiding out
in the bathroom.

362
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,680
I wasn't hiding, I swear.

363
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,726
We can at least agree that
I may have left you a little wanting?

364
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,436
Yeah.

365
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,813
So, you're saying you did want it
to last longer than eight seconds?

366
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,982
No! I mean, yeah, as in--

367
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,358
Wait, I thought it was a race.

368
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,943
Didn't I win?

369
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,528
No?

370
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,532
I just... I thought it'd be nice
if I came and surprised you.

371
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:52,996
And not leave you with
that memory of me for too long.

372
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,877
How did you, um...
How did you know I was here?

373
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,089
Oh, well, you posted
a nature shot this morning.

374
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,591
See that little restaurant sign
in the background?

375
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,552
Apparently,
Pops and Millie's ain't a chain.

376
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,221
-Hmm. Shocking. Really should be.
-Yeah.

377
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,974
So I googled it and I saw
all the information about the festival

378
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,435
and I figured this was probably why
you were in the area,

379
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,105
and by the way, this outfit
is really workin' on you, too.

380
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,022
Oh.

381
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,607
Um...

382
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,445
Can you hold on for just one second?

383
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,200
Hey, sweetie.
Cooper's kinda hitting a wall.

384
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,410
We were gonna head back
and rest up before dinner.

385
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,372
Okay, I'll find my own ride
back to the hotel.

386
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,458
And who is this handsome gentleman?

387
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,253
Sorry, this is Joe.

388
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,880
He works at a bookstore
I go to in the city.

389
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,965
Hey, Joe.

390
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,176
This is my wife, Nancy.
I'm Ned, Beck's dad.

391
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,387
-Hi.
-Very nice to meet you both.

392
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,806
You're welcome to join us
for dinner, Joe.

393
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,642
Yes! Totally. If you can.

394
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,229
I'd love to.

395
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,355
We'll see you then.

396
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,696
Okay, uh, I can explain. Um...

397
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:16,288
One day when I was 12, I got home
from school before my brother and sister,

398
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,248
and my mom was at work.

399
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,252
So I go into the basement
to play Mario Brothers,

400
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,545
and I...

401
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:29,593
I find my father unconscious

402
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,761
with a needle in his arm.

403
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,765
I thought he was dead.

404
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,270
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

405
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,938
I mean, he survived it.

406
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,235
And, which, of course,
was this amazing thing.

407
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,072
So, when he disappeared on us
because he relapsed, I just...

408
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,533
I couldn't believe it.

409
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,996
Right then and there,
I decided he was dead.

410
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,629
Which is why I told you he was,
which is totally wrong.

411
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,255
I mean, who does that?

412
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,798
Well--

413
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,011
The first deep, personal thing
I tell you is a total lie.

414
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,013
Well, hang on. That's--

415
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,515
I know, I get it if you are horrified

416
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,727
and think I'm a total fraud and liar
and want nothing to do with me.

417
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,812
After everything you've been through?

418
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,483
I get it. I'm sorry.

419
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,322
You're sorry?

420
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:35,951
I am.

421
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,706
Anyway, I was at Brown

422
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,292
and he tracked me down
to say he'd gotten clean.

423
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,297
And then he says he wants to help
with my school and some of my bills,

424
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,549
like dad amends.

425
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,513
So I bury my resentment
and start having lunches with him

426
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,723
and doing stupid shit like this,

427
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,810
playing the dutiful daughter,

428
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,273
enduring this nauseatingly perfect
new family of his.

429
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,941
I'm sure they're not perfect.

430
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,776
Believe me. They are.

431
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,945
Well, I guess I'll find out tonight.

432
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,823
No, I am not
subjecting you to that.

433
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:19,202
I'll just... I'll tell them
you had to go back. Book emergency.

434
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,997
I'd be on board,
but that would be so un-Victorian of me.

435
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,958
The virtuous maiden
is supposed to be rescued

436
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:30,213
by the dashing, sometimes broody,
altogether charming hero.

437
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,049
And who is that?
Is that meant to be you?

438
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,511
That boat, she can take it.
You know it.

439
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,096
No, no. I know. I know it well.

440
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,014
I don't know if Beck's told you,

441
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,725
but I captained the Nantucket ferry
for 16 years.

442
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:46,229
I did not know that. I feel like I've been
telling Mickey Mantle how to hold a bat.

443
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,189
Do you sail, too?

444
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,150
God, no. Never had the patience for it.

445
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,527
Oh, Dad,
you know your way around a sailboat.

446
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,655
Enough to know I'm all thumbs.
I've been out a couple times.

447
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,283
You don't remember the renters next door?

448
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,202
They had that Sunfish
they let you take out? The Murphys?

449
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,997
Their cars
were always blocking the driveway.

450
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,999
How's life in the big city, dear?

451
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,127
It's great, thanks for asking.

452
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,213
Oh, and we broke our centerboard
that one time,

453
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,090
and the current took us, like,
halfway to Long Island?

454
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,676
What'd I say? Not much of a sailor.

455
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,261
But you do. You remember it, right?

456
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,971
It was pouring.

457
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,557
I learned every swear word
in the book that day.

458
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,731
-I don't think he remembers, dear.
-I think he can speak for himself, Nancy.

459
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:35,653
You know, you don't have to protect him.
He's not a child.

460
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,654
You're one to talk.

461
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,198
Excuse me?

462
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,868
You invest nothing in this family.
Nothing.

463
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,371
Not even a call to your father
on his birthday.

464
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,290
You know what? Stop.
You've no idea what you're talking about.

465
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:51,127
Because your father,
he's just an ATM to you, right, Beck?

466
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,004
Please, let's not do this.

467
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm sorry, and what is he to you?

468
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,049
A feature for your blog,

469
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:59,677
so you can brag how you lifted him
out of the pits of despair?

470
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,180
Newsflash! He was sober when you met him.

471
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:06,059
I was in the pits with him.
And not because I wasn't Christian enough.

472
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,978
You didn't save him.

473
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,564
You think he'll fall over
if you pulled your hand out of his ass?

474
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,566
Guinevere, enough.

475
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,319
- What the hell are you looking at?
- Guinevere.

476
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,073
-Do not talk to my daughter that way.
-Okay, whatever. I'm done.

477
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:25,829
Oh, and congrats on the baby.
How blessed you all are.

478
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,734
Do you want him dead?

479
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,989
What?

480
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,911
Kinda feels like you and he...

481
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,331
have some unresolved stuff.

482
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,043
Believe me, I'm the king
of unresolved family issues.

483
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,254
I know what people splitting feels like.

484
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,717
I just wonder if, uh...

485
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,637
Look, he's here. He's alive.

486
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,184
Use that as an opportunity to talk to him.

487
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,897
Or, you're a writer.

488
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,400
Could be helpful to write about him.
Cathartic, too.

489
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,359
What are you doing?

490
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,696
-Nothing. I don't know.
-Do you hear yourself right now?

491
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,241
I mean, who the hell are you to tell me
that I have daddy issues?

492
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,660
-You don't even know me.
-No, Beck, hang on.

493
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,706
Just go. Leave me alone. I'm serious.

494
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,690
Hey, hon.

495
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,860
We're gonna get going.

496
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,990
Cool. Um...

497
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,785
Thanks for dinner.

498
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,872
This should cover the room.

499
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,223
It's hard for me to see you with them.

500
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,561
I keep waiting for you to be you again.

501
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,106
- This is me, Guinevere.
- No, it's not. You were...

502
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:03,111
Reckless and out of control.
And, honey, you were a kid. You...

503
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,030
-You didn't see what was going on.
-Yes.

504
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,324
Yes, I did.

505
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,494
And you were more than just an addict.

506
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,956
I miss you.

507
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,714
Whatever.

508
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,383
You know, I tell people that you're dead.

509
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,263
Kind of feels like you did die
that day in the basement.

510
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,437
I'm sorry you feel that way.

511
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,275
You were a good sailor.

512
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,701
Well, maybe you can tell me
about it sometime.

513
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,412
Maybe in Vermont...

514
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,040
over Christmas.

515
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,129
Like I said, I'll have to let you know.

516
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,307
"On the plywood over the bay window
We spray paint taunts at Hurricane Isabel

517
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,893
Cow her into a tropical storm

518
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,814
Her moon tide, though
Carries your beach chair away

519
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,445
Sea glass and Springsteen

520
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,907
The beached whale
The silent walk home

521
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,327
The grill that doesn't start
On the Fourth of July

522
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,254
The woman at the drug store you hit on
Who isn't Mom

523
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:32,635
The renters blocking the drive
The string of my sweatshirt I gnaw on

524
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,848
Morning sun over Wauwinet

525
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,600
The red ladle over the pan

526
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,520
Your wrist, the perfect cant

527
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,736
You leave for the 8:20 to Hyannis
With one commandment

528
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,698
Get the batter off the ladle
While it's wet

529
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,750
The ladle's left in the sink

530
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,047
Mom lets it soak
"Leave it," she says

531
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,133
You go away and we come home

532
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:18,056
And what's left of you, it loosens
And the water carries it away"

533
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,621
They say girls with daddy issues
are really good in bed.

Hey, stranger.

554
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,417
You drool in your sleep. So cute.

555
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,586
Were you watching me?

556
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,004
Maybe.

557
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,007
Uh-oh. Stalker.

558
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,177
Learned from the best.

559
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,361
How did you figure out where I live?

560
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,116
The bearded guy from the bookstore.

561
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,415
You taste like maple syrup.

562
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:19,880
Wait.

563
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,764
I have to apologize about our talk.

564
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,975
I was a hostile goose.

565
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,396
-A hostile goose?
-Yeah, geese are total dicks.

566
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:40,192
But, uh, no, seriously,
you called me on my shit,

567
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,280
and I took it really poorly because...

568
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,033
Well, because you were totally right,

569
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,243
and I didn't want to hear it,
and I'm sorry.

570
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,871
Like you said, we barely know each other
and here I was, trying--

571
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,165
You really don't think we know each other?

572
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,293
I mean, I was just...
I was angry when I said that, and--

573
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,336
Look...

574
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,382
sometimes I could swear
I've known you forever,

575
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,302
but in the grand scheme of things,

576
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,931
not long enough for me to be commenting
on your relationship with your father.

577
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,685
You were just trying to help me see
that I'm full of shit.

578
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,312
And you were sweet.

579
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,524
It's funny,
I feel like every guy I date is...

580
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,862
They're either messes like my dad was,
or they're like my dad is now,

581
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,490
trying to be something
they think they should.

582
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,661
Or they're me. Both a mess and a fraud.

583
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,414
-You're not a fraud.
-So just a mess?

584
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,500
No. Not more than anyone.

585
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,169
But then there is you.

586
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,089
I mean, you're not trying to be
anything than what you are.

587
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:47,093
You're just you.
There's not an ounce of falseness in you.

588
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,721
I mean, you drink Café Bustelo
and you own starch

589
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,267
and you don't care about dumb shit
like posting your life online.

590
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,770
I mean, it's a revelation.

591
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,900
Do you know how many selfies
I've taken on the toilet?

592
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,945
A lot.

593
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,952
Okay, instead of sitting here
watching you judge me,

594
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,161
I'm gonna go pee...

595
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,830
I'm not...

596
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,499
...and try not to take a selfie.

597
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,338
What are the chances
I'm getting a follow-up review?

598
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,854
Apparently, I've redeemed myself.

599
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,358
Far be it from me to stop you
from shouting it from the rooftops.

600
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,696
Plus, I guess it is nice
to hear it from your friends.

601
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,994
Even if not all of them
can share in your happiness.

602
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,582
It's really too bad.

603
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,377
The one whose approval you crave most
isn't my biggest fan.

604
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,431
Fortunately,
Paco's a remarkably quick reader.

605
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,271
I can return the book I, of course,
never had any intention of keeping.

606
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,191
And if that's not enough...

607
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,027
If Peach still has a problem...

608
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,657
Well, every relationship
has its obstacles to overcome, right?

609
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,869
I won't let her
get in the way of us, Beck.

610
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,579
I won't.
