1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,394
<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,107
What are you doing, Love?

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,068
That boy will distract you from your son.

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>I can't cage what's inside of me.</i>

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,</i>

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,493
<i>but make sure it knows the rules.</i>

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>So now I have you, Marienne.</i>

8
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>Things will be different this time.</i>

9
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,536
Oh.

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,375
If you look up "klutz,"
there's a picture of me.

11
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,459
Oh.

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,252
Okay.

13
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>Here's what I've learned about you
in the last few days, Marienne.</i>

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,013
<i>You like things that make you feel.</i>

15
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>You're whimsical and artsy. You don't like
things that go together too perfectly.</i>

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,687
<i>You find beauty in the flaws.</i>

17
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>Unexpected pairings.</i>

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>You're deep, reverent, rooted,</i>

19
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>yet adventurous.</i>

20
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>You're at home in chaos,
but something tells me not by choice.</i>

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>You take care of books
and art and young minds,</i>

22
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,507
<i>but who takes care of you?</i>

23
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>No. No, no, no. This is not why I'm here.</i>

24
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,892
<i>I'm here, well,
to figure out why I'm here.</i>

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>Why you, Marienne?</i>

26
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>So I must leave everything as I found it.</i>

27
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,781
<i>I like following you.
You're interesting and unpredictable.</i>

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,535
<i>And that inner part of me
that needs this is mostly satiated,</i>

29
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>but in the spirit of self-awareness
and maybe conquering that inner thing,</i>

30
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>I ask again,</i>

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,334
<i>why am I drawn to you?</i>

32
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,920
Great! Yeah, sure.

33
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,298
<i>Shit.</i>

34
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,594
Oh, all right.

35
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,052
Okay.

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,014
Okay, great.

37
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>Home early.
It's very unusual for you.</i>

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,937
Yes, yes, I know that place.

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,358
Okay. Yeah, great. I'll see you there.

40
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,821
<i>What's got you stepping
out of your routine?</i>

41
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,242
<i>I dearly hope it doesn't involve
pegging someone on this bed. RIP Peach.</i>

42
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,996
<i>Okay, now you're just playing with me.</i>

43
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,298
<i>Lipstick.</i>

44
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,008
<i>Are you going on a date?</i>

45
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,855
<i>My wife.</i>

46
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,065
<i>I deserve this.</i>

47
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,907
Aw, Daddy's still working.

48
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,044
<i>She's the best wife ever...</i>

49
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>while I'm doing this.</i>

50
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,009
<i>All to prove you aren't worth it.</i>

51
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,929
<i>You are just a fleeting crush.</i>

52
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,383
- Dad, hey, what...?
- Hi.

53
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,886
What about Tokyo?
You said you'd be away till next month.

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,306
Yeah. Team's wrapping things up, so...

55
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,518
Okay, well, congrats
on your sudden ability to delegate.

56
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,936
Thank you.

57
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,982
So, like, you forgot
to sleep over there, or...?

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,151
I just got off a long flight, Theo.

59
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,903
- It's good to have you home.
- Good to be home.

60
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,197
Did you wanna ask why I'm here?

61
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,451
Of course.

62
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,577
Of course.

63
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,915
- What happened at school?
- Decided to take some time off.

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,170
With everything that happened,
felt like it was starting to get to me.

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,921
Hey, that's okay.

66
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,340
I can understand.

67
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,553
- We could go grab some food.
- I can't. I've got stuff to do inside.

68
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,805
Yeah, yeah. For sure.

69
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,015
<i>Remember when we crashed Dad's
beloved Maserati? We were all banged up.</i>

70
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,852
<i>But better to suffer in silence
than let him know what we did.</i>

71
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,229
<i>This feels like that.</i>

72
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>Only, I can't take this damaged thing
to the wrong side of town</i>

73
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,359
<i>and claim someone stole it.</i>

74
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,738
<i>I cheated on my soul mate.</i>

75
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,907
<i>What's wrong with me, Forty?</i>

76
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,370
<i>If you were here, you'd laugh.
You said I'd be a terrible mom.</i>

77
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>Number two might be in me as we speak,
and there's no one I can tell that...</i>

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,377
<i>I'm not sure I want it.</i>

79
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,757
<i>Stop insinuating.</i>

80
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,634
<i>It's not Theo's baby.</i>

81
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,387
<i>Couldn't be, I don't think.</i>

82
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,605
<i>What am I doing?</i>

83
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,902
<i>Your phone is dead in my nightstand
because you are dead.</i>

84
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,407
<i>And no one will ever read this.
So, what am I confessing for?</i>

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,831
<i>Speaking of terrible mothers...</i>

86
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,003
<i>Ugh. The last thing I need is a weekend
all about Dottie and her second act.</i>

87
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,046
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

88
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>I need you.</i>

97
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,410
What the fuck?

98
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,579
What the fuck are you doing?

99
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,124
Thought that would get your attention.
This shit's romantic as fuck.

100
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,877
- What are you talking about?
- According to all the rom-coms

101
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,963
of your generation,
this is what the guys do to get the girl.

102
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,842
First of all, I'm not that old.
And this is not a game, Theo.

103
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,179
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Sorry.
I don't know what to do.

104
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,806
But you're ignoring me.

105
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,725
I just... I need your advice

106
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,811
'cause you're the only person
that I actually trust.

107
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,815
So my dad's back.

108
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,152
He's already sequestered in his office.

109
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,278
And I just...

110
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,072
I don't know.

111
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,575
I don't know what to do.

112
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,788
He's not doing well.

113
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,418
Yeah. Your dad is grieving, Theo.
It's a roller coaster that doesn't end.

114
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,546
I was just texting my dead brother.

115
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,465
- Come here.
- What? No.

116
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,592
Just go take care of your dad.

117
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,555
I know he can be a dick,
but try to see where he's coming from.

118
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,890
I bet it's not a bad place.

119
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,766
Okay.

120
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,186
Can I ask you one more thing?

121
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,522
Sure.

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,984
Do you think of me
during sex with your husband?

123
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,028
- Seriously?
- Because yours is the only face I see.

124
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,698
You need to leave.
Go take care of your dad.

125
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,118
<i>Do I deserve this?</i>

126
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,582
<i>Is this new baby a gift or a punishment?</i>

127
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>God, that sounds terrible. Am I terrible?
Why did I do it, Forty, if I'm so happy?</i>

128
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,676
- Need help over there?
- No, I got it.

129
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,851
Smells amazing.

130
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,938
<i>I don't deserve him.</i>

131
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,066
<i>I don't deserve her.</i>

132
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,736
<i>She's making food,
so I'm nourished all weekend,</i>

133
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,365
<i>and here I am counting the minutes
till she's gone so I can follow you.</i>

134
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,493
- Perfect bite. Ready?
- Ooh.

135
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,077
Oh, yeah.

136
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,207
Mm.

137
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>Let me be clear. You fascinate me.</i>

138
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,177
<i>But Love is my soul mate,</i>

139
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>mother of my child,</i>

140
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,889
<i>love of my life.</i>

141
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,768
<i>And my job as a husband
and a father is to keep it that way.</i>

142
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>I'm happy.</i>

143
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,072
Of course you are.

144
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,408
Your mind's on nothing but your wife.

145
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,329
All the time.

146
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,294
Hey, you okay?

147
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,506
Yeah.

148
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
Yeah.

149
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,100
How do you get it so fucking moist?

150
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,063
Come show me.

151
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,024
Yeah. Just like that.

152
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,337
That was great.

153
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,590
That was so great.

154
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,350
I appreciate you taking
this meeting face-to-face.

155
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,979
I like to know I can put you in a headlock
when I'm not getting through to you.

156
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,398
A loving headlock.

157
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,194
I can only assume
the best part of this is now behind us.

158
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,781
I'd appreciate if you tell me
before you hire an investigator

159
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,617
to look into your wife's case
that's closed.

160
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,370
- Is it? You bought that?
- What did he find?

161
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,665
He tell you
the neighbors' daughter's a coke dealer?

162
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,251
Wanna take a look?

163
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,089
- Help yourself.
- Oh.

164
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,594
Bottom-line it, anything remotely
interesting in all this guy's work?

165
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,556
One thing that's interesting to me
is your neighbor, the baker,

166
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,516
Quinn of the L.A. Quinns,

167
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,353
meaning she probably has her own PIs
who know what you're up to.

168
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,608
And the most litigious father this side
of Republicans whining for a recount.

169
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,943
Except Ray Quinn, he wins.

170
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,113
- I haven't broken any laws.
- A look this bad should be illegal.

171
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,450
You mean, my trying to figure out
who murdered my wife? Can you imagine?

172
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,828
You do understand what will happen
when the townspeople learn

173
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,622
you're having them investigated?

174
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,416
They'll make noise.

175
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,084
- Great.
- No, not great.

176
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,379
I just spent six months trying to put
some light between this company

177
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,424
and words like marital affair, murder.

178
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,444
- Different lanes.
- I'm not disappearing your ass

179
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,888
back to Tokyo while I spend another six
putting out more fires you've lit.

180
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,598
Different fucking lanes!

181
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,184
This isn't about the company.

182
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, because you and the company I protect
aren't at all the exact same thing?

183
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,530
Listen, I...

184
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,536
I understand that you're grieving.
That's reasonable.

185
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,119
Grieve.

186
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,871
But this?

187
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,919
This will cost not just you
but every person who works for you.

188
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,255
You'll destroy lives for nothing

189
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,758
because the worst offense
the townspeople are guilty of is

190
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,468
tacky athleisure.

191
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,805
It stops now. You get that, right?

Changing lives is my passion.

205
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,481
That's why I bought Casa Gaia Vineyard
and intend to make it a hub

206
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,733
for transformation

207
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,403
and organic, biodynamic fine wines.

These women are about to experience
a defining moment in their lives.

212
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,667
The Women Optimizing Motherhood
and Business Summit

213
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,586
will set a path into the future.

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Now let's toast.

217
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,636
To womanhood, motherhood

218
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,846
and the entrepreneurial spirit.

219
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,141
And cut. Yes!

220
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,645
That was perfection.
I'll check this file and AirDrop you.

221
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,022
The Internet is gonna swoon
when you post this.

222
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,275
- Thank you for being here.
- Hey, Sherry.

223
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,569
- Sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

224
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,282
- Did the nursery take our little man?
- Practically took him out of my hands.

225
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,286
This could not have come at a better time.
You look exhausted.

226
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>It begins.</i>

227
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,082
Yeah, I haven't made it to my room yet
but thank you.

228
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:03,128
Trust me. Come Monday, you will be
the picture of relaxation. Want some?

229
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,047
I'm good.

230
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,299
Not pregnant, are you?

231
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,928
- <i>Keep it together. She smells fear.</i>
- I'm on a mini detox.

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,764
You are? Oh, my God.

233
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:18,102
- Is it Joe's or that neighbor kid's?
- Keep your voice down. I was...

234
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,563
I have seconds before kickoff.
We'll finish this later.

235
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,483
Maybe a little lipstick, sweetheart?
You're pale.

236
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,570
<i>Remember pretending to be orphans?</i>

237
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
<i>That was fun.</i>

238
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,169
<i>Your work face, giving nothing away.</i>

239
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,014
Excuse me. Where's <i>Narnia?</i>

240
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,267
Oh, it's in Kid Lit.
You see that tree over there?

241
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,893
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

242
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,279
<i>You're leaving mid-shift?
Could this be opportunity knocking?</i>

243
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,242
Hey, Dante.

244
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,371
Marienne asked me to take care
of the overdue notices?

245
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,290
Was that at the desk here?

246
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,625
Her office. She'll be back in an hour.

247
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,336
Okay. I think she meant while she's out.

248
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,505
So diligent...

249
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,593
after taking three hours
to shelve that one cart this morning.

250
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,553
Thank you.

251
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,983
<i>Okay.</i>

252
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,945
<i>Doesn't exactly scream skeletons
but then neither do you.</i>

253
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,535
<i>There's nothing in your work files
or search history.</i>

254
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,580
<i>It's just, there's no "you" here at all,</i>

255
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>which tells me
I'm not looking hard enough.</i>

256
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,590
<i>Hmm. "Recovery." This is a surprise.</i>

257
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,552
<i>This deepens my curiosity,
and now I need more.</i>

258
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,647
<i>"Child endangerment"?</i>

259
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
<i>"Neglect."</i>

260
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,400
<i>"Abuse."</i>

261
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,319
<i>This can't be right.</i>

262
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>The ex-husband, I presume.</i>

263
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,451
<i>The more I know,</i>

264
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>the less I understand.</i>

265
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,081
<i>Who are you?</i>

266
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,416
<i>What I do know,</i>

267
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,252
<i>your problems are serious.</i>

268
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,420
<i>You're a mess.</i>

269
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,214
<i>I have a loving wife, a son.</i>

270
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,967
<i>I can't have anything to do
with your red flags.</i>

271
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,594
<i>This itch has been scratched.</i>

272
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,434
"What did I want? A tarnished
marriage that takes so much work to heal?

273
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,228
A family that consumed me?

274
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,439
No, I deserved better.

275
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,067
All at once,
I knew what that looked like."

276
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,694
<i>What does it look like?</i>

277
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,697
"I realized I had more to offer."

278
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,535
And so, I started writing.

279
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,871
Eventually, I started my own company,

280
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,706
and it was hard.

281
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,166
It was exhausting.

282
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,335
But if I could do it, you can too.

283
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,380
<i>That's it?</i>

284
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,216
All right. Who has a question?

285
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,220
- Yes, right here.
- Given all you've accomplished,

286
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,014
how do you stay so humble?

287
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,682
<i>Is she joking?</i>

288
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,395
I start the first half hour
of every morning expressing gratitude.

289
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,566
A great way to remember that none of us
can get through this life without help.

290
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,611
All right. Who's next?

291
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,740
If you're supposed to be giving us
the secret of joy,

292
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,824
what is it?

293
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,579
I don't hear you saying
what a 21st-century professional mother

294
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,789
is supposed to do to find happiness.

295
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,499
Simple.

296
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,543
If you focus on watering your own grass,

297
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,837
you never have to wonder
if it's greener anywhere else.

298
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,716
But what does that mean? I...
I water my own grass, and I don't...

299
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,636
- Okay, next.
- It's fine. You don't what?

300
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,014
You don't feel how incredibly green
your own grass is?

301
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,058
Is it possible
that you don't wanna succeed?

302
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:30,270
That you feel guilty for what you have
and you sabotage your happiness?

303
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,278
I would suggest a look inward
and read my book.

304
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,448
To read more about your narcissistic climb
to success, when, poof,

305
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,450
you suddenly discovered
you were deserving?

306
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,786
Sounds like privileged bullshit to me.

307
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,043
<i>I'm not sorry.</i>

308
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,923
<i>She doesn't know what she's talking about.
I do want to succeed, obviously, right?</i>

309
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,426
You are powerful. You are loved.
You are forgiven.

310
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,929
Mm. Thank you.

311
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,848
I am sorry.

312
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,644
- We've moved on.
- It's not too late to turn the day around.

313
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,523
Sherry had the brilliant idea, we do
an IGTV interview with each other and...

314
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,191
We want you to be a part of it.

315
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,903
- Interview for what?
- Our brands.

316
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,948
But also to counteract
your little outburst.

317
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,077
You were right about one thing.

318
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,914
Women need to see other successful women
supporting each other.

319
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,293
How better to use our privilege, right?

320
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,920
Hashtag "You can sit with us."

321
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,588
Sure.

322
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,847
Hello, goddesses.

323
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,765
I'm at the W.O.M.B. Summit

324
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,310
with <i>Heart-Shaped Mistakes</i> creator

325
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,896
and fellow twin mom Sherry Conrad.

326
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,605
Sherry,

327
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,109
your blog moves me.

328
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,362
But it's your heart
that really touches me.

329
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,864
Oh, Dottie.

330
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,157
<i>Oh, woof.</i>

331
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,076
You are a shining light for us all.

332
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,705
- Thank you for being my soul sister.
<i>- Vomit emoji.</i>

333
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,332
And last but not least,

334
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,960
my pride and joy, Love Quinn-Goldberg.

335
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,674
I'm so proud to have raised a daughter
whose grit nearly matches my own.

336
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,718
- <i>Nearly?</i>
- Doing it all.

337
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:29,264
Husband, business, 1-year-old,
all with possibly another on the way.

338
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,348
Oh, my God, Mom.

339
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,768
- Oh, my God, Love! Amazing!
- What the fuck?

340
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,062
- What are you doing?
- Sherry, give us a second.

341
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,856
- Love, I just...
- Seriously, get the fuck out.

342
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,066
Thank you.

343
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,072
How the hell could you do that?
I'm not sure. I haven't told Joe.

344
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,993
It's not surprising. The problems
in your marriage keep stacking up.

345
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,370
Mom, it has nothing to do with you.

346
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,248
My life, my marriage, my womb,

347
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,335
none of your fucking business,
and not to share on social media.

348
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,921
- Don't speak to me like that.
- Somebody has to.

349
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,965
You're the reason
Forty and I are fucked up.

350
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,010
- Don't talk about him.
- No wonder that our life turned into this.

351
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,888
All you ever showed me
was to get the prince,

352
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,390
build a castle,
and then burn it all to the ground.

353
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,977
Says the princess who was given all
the mattresses in the world to sleep on

354
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,105
and still complains she can feel a pea.

355
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,773
I gave you the world,

356
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,691
you ungrateful, little bitch.

357
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,820
You have no idea
what I had to do to give it to you.

358
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,156
Your choice to fuck the neighbor boy
or blow up your life

359
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,036
has nothing to do with me and everything
to do with you being spoiled and bored.

360
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,832
I'll take the blame for spoiling you.
But the source of your unhappiness?

361
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:41,044
Look in the mirror instead of spouting
your hypocrisy at everyone else.

362
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,709
Dad, I got you dinner.

363
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,297
Dad?

364
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,015
Come on, you can be mad at me,
but at least eat something.

365
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,253
What the fuck?

366
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,473
Almost ready to go, Goldberg?

367
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,767
No, you go ahead. I'll close up.

368
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,145
<i>The smell of your perfume could
erase everything I've learned today.</i>

369
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,233
<i>- Best to hang back for now.</i>
- No way. You know the rules.

370
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,700
Do me a favor
and stay down there a sec, okay?

371
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,993
You hired a lawyer?

372
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,120
- Let's talk outside.
- No.

373
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,404
<i>Is that your ex-husband?</i>

374
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,808
No, you don't have any rights,
you fucking junkie.

375
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,459
<i>That doesn't sound right.</i>

376
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,854
- Listen to me...
- Get your hands off...

377
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,298
- Get your hands off me!
- No, no... Hey, no, we're not done.

378
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,382
Hey!

379
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,470
- What is going on here?
- Hey, man, I'm sorry. That...

380
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,849
This looks bad, right?
I knocked that over by accident.

381
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
It must have sounded crazy.

382
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,853
I'm... I'm Ryan Goodwin.

383
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,731
If I look familiar, Channel Three News.

384
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,069
I recognize you.
I think you should leave, Ryan.

385
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,112
Yeah, sure.

386
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Sure.

387
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,785
Look, you know, exes.

388
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,999
- But the respect's there.
- Don't look at her. Just go.

389
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,626
Yeah.

390
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,463
Talk later, Mare.

391
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
- You okay?
- You shouldn't have done that.

392
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,429
I didn't ask for your help.

393
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,098
What part of "stay out of it"
did you not understand?

394
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,850
Was that too hard?

395
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,973
You really had to run up here
like some white knight

396
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,104
and get in the middle of my shit?

397
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,564
You're crazy!

398
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,984
Which is 100%
none of your goddamn business, Joe!

399
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,945
- You sick fuck!
<i>- I see it now.</i>

400
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,031
<i>This is why "you."</i>

401
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,868
<i>- You're a pattern.
- Thought he'd be better this time.</i>

402
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,495
<i>If you look up "klutz,"
there's a picture of me.</i>

403
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,914
<i>You're a lost lamb
attracted to wolves.</i>

404
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,208
<i>- Ergo, what I feel...</i>
- Just let me handle it.

405
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:12,088
<i>...it's not because you're special, it's...
Wait for it. It's mother issues.</i>

406
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,965
<i>How's that for self-awareness?</i>

407
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,468
Am I amusing you?

408
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,470
No, no, no. No.

409
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,473
I'm sorry. Also, I'm not sorry.

410
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,768
I'm not one to let bullies bully.
I would've done that for anybody.

411
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,977
Okay.

412
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,334
<i>Fuck Dottie.</i>

413
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,630
<i>What's she know?
We were accessories to her.</i>

414
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,965
<i>A couple of purse dogs she'd overfeed,</i>

415
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,843
<i>then scream at
when we shit on her Gucci wallet.</i>

416
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,011
<i>Fuck Dottie.</i>

417
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,013
<i>I hate her.</i>

418
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,653
<i>I hate you too.</i>

419
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,905
<i>For leaving me with her.</i>

420
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,033
<i>You should've just eaten me
in the womb, Forty.</i>

421
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,392
Did you just answer me?

422
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,521
What the fuck?

423
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,731
Forty?

424
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,984
God.

425
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,197
I am wasted.

426
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,665
So wasted.

427
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,419
Oh, my God. Forty!

428
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,005
Wait.

429
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,133
Are you really here?

430
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,804
Yeah, of course, Lovey.

431
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,515
I live inside you.

432
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,142
I'm always here.

433
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:34,397
<i>♪ Just call my name and I'll be there ♪</i>

434
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,650
All seriousness though,

435
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,906
how happy are we that I am
the only thing living inside you?

436
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,992
Dodged a bullet.

437
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,037
- Good job, vagina.
- Did I though?

438
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,705
Dodge a bullet? I mean...

439
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,916
I am relieved,

440
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:58,505
but, I don't know, I can't help but wonder
if maybe another baby would calm me down.

441
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,009
- Focus me a little.
- First of all, no.

442
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,344
And, B,

443
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,056
do you really think
focusing is what you need?

444
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,974
I thought I needed to get married.

445
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,394
Then move and start over.

446
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,355
Then a bakery.

447
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,984
Then someone who wasn't my husband.

448
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,612
I get it though. That kid is pretty cool.

449
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,406
Kind of reminds me of me.

450
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,580
Forty, I don't know what happened.

451
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,626
I fell so in love with Joe.

452
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,004
But now I don't... I don't even...

453
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,341
like him...

454
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,509
anymore.

455
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,556
I mean, he makes me feel bad for being me.

456
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,562
That's not how your soul mate's supposed
to make you feel, right?

457
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,280
I'm self-sabotaging, aren't I?

458
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,030
Yeah.

459
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,538
- Why can't I just be happy?
- Oh, Lovey.

460
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,751
You're not happy
because Joe isn't your soul mate.

461
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,963
I am.

462
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,301
There is one person

463
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,554
who understands
what you have been through.

464
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,598
I slept on those mattresses too.

465
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,809
I mean, that pea fucking killed me.

466
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,688
I am so sorry.

467
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,151
Don't be sorry for surviving.

468
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,614
You were the strong one.

469
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,826
You always knew
it was gonna turn out this way.

470
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,288
It's why you held me so tight.

471
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,846
<i>♪ I'll be there ♪</i>

472
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,599
<i>♪ I'll be there ♪</i>

473
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:22,815
<i>♪ Just call my name and I'll be there ♪</i>

474
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,166
<i>Mommy issues.</i>

475
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,503
<i>I can't believe it's taken me this long.
I'm growing.</i>

476
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,548
<i>"The absence of burden causes man
to be lighter than air,</i>

477
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,302
<i>to soar into heights,
take leave of the earth, free.</i>

478
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,931
<i>What then shall we choose?
Weight or lightness?"</i>

479
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,355
- Hey, what...?
<i>- Hey. It's an emergency.</i>

480
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,440
<i>I'm sorry for calling so late.</i>

481
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,175
- Hey.
- Hey.

482
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,929
- What happened?
- Sprinkler system malfunctioned.

483
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,309
I tried to get somebody to look at it,
now thousands of books are destroyed...

484
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,313
- and I'll lose my job.
- That won't happen.

485
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,608
Not your fault the county's too cheap
to invest in building upkeep.

486
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,364
You happen to have called
the best book doctor in the world,

487
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,783
so we'll figure out what's salvageable.

488
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,618
It'll be fine.

489
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,165
Okay. Well, I'm choosing to believe you.

490
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,632
<i>This is about books.</i>

491
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,551
<i>For the love of books.</i>

492
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,803
<i>I would've done the same thing
if Dante called.</i>

493
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,387
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,727
About earlier.
I know you were just trying to help.

495
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,397
I know it's no excuse,

496
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,151
but my ex-husband brings out my worst.

497
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,735
It's okay.

498
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,030
We're all works in progress.

499
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,868
"When you've been worked on for so long,
you never know you're done."

500
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,205
Jericho Brown.

501
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,083
You know his work?

502
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,544
<i>What am I doing, using my old games
on you? I'm not this guy anymore.</i>

503
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:54,509
I read his work in <i>The New Yorker,</i>
and that line... stayed with me.

504
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,637
But I don't know
his writing much, actually.

505
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,110
<i>The way you've handled
those books. The care.</i>

506
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,237
<i>Only a mother... Oh, there. Yep.</i>

507
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,404
<i>Okay, stop.</i>

508
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,324
<i>But just to pass the time...</i>

509
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,370
It's a personal question,
but we are technically off-hours.

510
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,453
Just ask it.

511
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,748
What's your daughter like?

512
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,211
Amazing.

513
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,298
Kind, funny,

514
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,219
likes to go out
and look for fairy rings at the park.

515
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,388
Excellent at finding them.

516
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,806
Loves to draw.

517
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,266
Like her mom.

518
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,394
Yeah, nothing in this world beats
the feeling of...

519
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,646
Of looking at your child

520
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,482
and knowing you're watching
someone grow up better than you.

521
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,485
<i>How could you do anything
to hurt your child?</i>

522
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,778
<i>All I see is love.</i>

523
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,946
Your turn.

524
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,991
- What's Henry like?
- Oh, he's a terrorist.

525
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:05,580
No, he's... He's adorable, he's sweet.
A big fan of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

526
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,707
No surprise,
you've seen him with the bottle.

527
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,460
<i>I really hope he's better than me.</i>

528
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,213
Why do you look like that?

529
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,889
I had this idea...

530
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,142
of happily ever after.

531
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,020
Perfect family, picket fence.
Now I have that.

532
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,887
I want what's best for my son.

533
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,317
I'm just worried that this suburban,
cookie-cutter existence isn't...

534
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,820
Isn't it. I know it's nothing compared
to your situation.

535
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,114
- I shouldn't be complaining.
- No, I get it.

536
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,158
Raising kids is a whole different game
once you've gone through the system.

537
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,044
Soon as you told me
you didn't come from money,

538
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,124
all of a sudden
I could just see it on you.

539
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,547
Yeah, I had been in a dozen foster homes
before I hit 18,

540
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,468
and still, even though I knew
it made no sense, I...

541
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,097
I never stopped thinking
my mom would show up and save me.

542
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,559
She never did, of course,

543
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,812
but sure made me wanna be
a better mom though.

544
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,733
I held on to that same hope.

545
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,569
For years.

546
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,698
And got my ass kicked regularly for it.

547
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,117
I think it kept me going.

548
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,871
But she never came back either.

549
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,710
I never talk about this with anyone,
not even Love.

550
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,383
Despite her best intentions,
she could only understand to a point.

551
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,551
<i>But you understand completely.</i>

552
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,597
Um...

553
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,934
We should get back to it.

554
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,561
What happened with Ryan?

555
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,438
I'm sorry.

556
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,984
I'm not okay with what I saw,

557
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,696
and I would like to know
how someone who treats you like that

558
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,739
could have custody of your child.

559
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,346
We were both addicts...

560
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,598
when Juliette was a baby.

561
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,727
One night, I...

562
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,563
I sailed through a red light.

563
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,025
And the other driver
was very seriously hurt,

564
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,862
and the way that we collided,
if Juliette had been on the other side...

565
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,613
<i>Reckless endangerment of a child.</i>

566
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,616
That disaster, and the fact
that he got clean before I did,

567
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,702
is how Ryan got full custody.

568
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,124
The lies he's told ever since is
how he's kept it.

569
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,250
The lies?

570
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,544
Well, you know, he's got money.

571
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,547
Beloved local celeb, a white man.

572
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,217
And I think we can both agree,
white men get a million chances in life.

573
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,181
So when he accuses me of child neglect,
for not showing up for my visitation,

574
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,724
they believe him.

575
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,518
Even when I swear
he gave me the wrong address.

576
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,731
He can have me arrested
for destruction of property

577
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,902
for keying his car that I barely scratched
'cause I chickened out.

578
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,570
And my favorite,

579
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,491
verbal and emotional abuse
for calling him a dickhead.

580
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,246
Yeah, and he's had this case built
against me for years,

581
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,873
and everyone believes him,

582
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:40,920
everyone takes his word over mine
because... who am I?

583
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,047
I'm sorry.

584
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,551
I'm so sorry for what you've been through.

585
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,682
Nobody forced me
to get behind the wheel that night.

586
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,766
That's...

587
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,395
That's a choice I live with.

588
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,815
Yeah, but everything else,
Ryan manipulating the justice system,

589
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,066
somebody should stop him.

590
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,694
<i>- I volunteer, happily.</i>
- Well, I am working on it.

591
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,281
I just met a new lawyer
for dinner last night.

592
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,784
<i>Lawyer. You weren't on a date.</i>

593
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,870
He thinks joint custody is doable

594
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,416
if I can just show
how I'm really doing now

595
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,834
and the judge sees it.

596
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:26,799
If I was sure Ryan could never find us,
I would grab Juliette and run to Paris.

597
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,137
And spend our days
drawing outside Sacré-Cœur.

598
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,057
That sounds magical.

599
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,350
<i>For you.</i>

600
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,103
<i>Tragic for me to lose you.</i>

601
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,274
<i>I shouldn't have reduced you to my issues.
You're nothing like my mother.</i>

602
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,276
<i>You adore your child
and she should be with you.</i>

603
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,736
<i>You're just who you are.</i>

604
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,866
<i>You don't hide or embellish,
you own your mistakes</i>

605
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,953
<i>and stand up to the strikes
against you. You're so...</i>

606
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,667
Oh! No! Please, no!

607
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,462
It's okay, look.

608
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,173
I think, it's... It's just us.

609
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,431
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

610
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,350
<i>Love is gonna kill you.</i>

611
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,873
Haven't really been yourself this weekend.

612
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,752
- You really pregnant?
- This is a hangover.

613
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,588
I'm not pregnant.

614
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm sorry to hear that.

615
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,969
It's fine.

616
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
Then what's going on?

617
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,846
I don't know.

618
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,435
I'm just not happy.

619
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,189
And it's not Joe's fault.

620
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,776
He's just not my soul mate.

621
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,989
No one who tries to love you really
measures up when you're a twin.

622
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,534
Well, I know from my own twins,
you are absolutely right.

623
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,036
But the whole soul-mate thing,

624
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,871
it's mostly bullshit.

625
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,874
You choose your soul mate.

626
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,334
Cary and I,

627
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,004
we had some fundamental problems.

628
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,172
I didn't even like him for a while.

629
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,386
But I decided he was my person,

630
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,887
and I made it work.

631
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,182
Love, it's mostly chemicals.

632
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,144
Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin.

633
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,437
To activate all three,

634
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,356
exercise, eat some protein,
squeeze in eight hugs a day.

635
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,817
- Mm.
- When you're happy and healthy,

636
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,236
then you can make real choices.

637
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,823
And that includes choosing your life mate.

638
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,074
That easy, huh?

639
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,659
It is not easy.

640
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,496
But it is so worth it.

641
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,499
<i>Dear Forty,</i>

642
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,961
<i>you've been my best friend
since before we were born.</i>

643
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,963
<i>My other half.</i>

644
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,675
<i>But I can't keep holding back
because I miss you.</i>

645
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,761
<i>I can't raise a family
with a broken heart.</i>

646
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,347
<i>I have to choose Joe now.</i>

647
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,562
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

648
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,607
<i>But I have to say goodbye.</i>

649
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,776
<i>For real this time.</i>

650
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,029
<i>As much as it hurts.</i>

651
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,158
<i>Goodbye, you.</i>

652
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,590
The fuck? What are you doing here?

653
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,094
You called me.

654
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,721
You drunk-dialed me at 4 a.m.

655
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,974
I was worried, so I... So I Ubered.

656
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,602
I'm sorry.
I don't remember that happening.

657
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,020
Oh, wow.

658
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,773
It's proof
that I'm in your subconscious though.

659
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,856
Okay.

660
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,528
I can drive you home,
but I need you to listen.

661
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,196
I care about you a lot.

662
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:03,575
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Can I just say something really quickly?

663
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,077
Sure.

664
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,912
My dad is a lot worse than I thought.

665
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:11,708
I went into his office,
and he hired a PI to stalk people.

666
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:16,755
And he has all this insane conspiracy shit

667
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,091
about Natalie's murder

668
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,928
with these names of people in Madre Linda,

669
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,013
including you and Joe.

670
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,849
What?

671
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,408
Nurse Fiona,
I think you'll like this. It's...

672
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,833
Wait for you outside, beautiful.

673
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,342
Hey, kid.

674
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,678
Love that book.

675
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,315
Sorry, today is not a good day.
I have to...

676
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,484
He gets mad at you and he hurts you.

677
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,029
He says he's sorry,
it'll never happen again,

678
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,490
and he gives you flowers, right?

679
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,661
There are a lot of bad men out there,

680
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,248
and sometimes you can't tell
until it's too late.

681
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,292
Go outside and eat with the other boys.

682
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,396
<i>I know now, Marienne.
I know why "you," and it's no pattern.</i>

683
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,650
<i>But today starts the next phase</i>

684
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,862
<i>of my growth to know you exist,
to see you, to love you even,</i>

685
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,864
<i>and to never have you.</i>

686
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,701
<i>Because as long as I love you,
you'll be in danger.</i>

687
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,330
Hi. Hi, can we talk?

688
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,375
- We have a lot to do today.
<i>- You wanna forget what happened.</i>

689
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,585
<i>Go back to business as usual.
I can't go back.</i>

690
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,297
<i>It's only a matter of time before I'm
making treasure boxes for Love to find.</i>

691
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,758
- Marienne...
- I have feelings for you.

692
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,969
I know nothing can happen.

693
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,889
You're married,
with the cutest baby on the planet,

694
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,933
and I'd never do anything
to split up a family,

695
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,434
and I need you to know that.

696
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,604
Not that you'd ever,

697
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,773
obviously, because...

698
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,526
you love your wife,

699
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,322
and we were just exhausted
and caught up in the moment.

700
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,576
So don't worry, I don't...
I don't want anything.

701
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,659
I just...

702
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:56,206
It can go away.
It can dissolve into nothing. Okay?

703
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,832
Cool?

704
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,625
Wait.

705
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,338
It's... It's not nothing.

706
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,882
I'd never break up your family.

707
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,095
- I'd never do anything to hurt Henry.
- I know.

708
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,641
I'd never get in the way
of you getting your family back.

709
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,729
- I would never hurt Juliette.
- I know.

710
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:28,989
<i>Oh, no.</i>

711
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,950
We can't do this.

712
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,368
I know.

713
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,703
<i>Shit.</i>

714
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,335
No, you...

715
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,962
- You have to go before this...
- I know. We can't.

716
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,881
I came here to quit.

717
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,342
I thought this would make it easier.

718
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,511
You don't have to do that.

719
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:56,808
But we should talk
when we're a bit more clear-headed.

720
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,025
<i>I have never felt more clear-headed.</i>

721
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,611
<i>But I do need time to figure out
what I'm gonna do about Love.</i>

722
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,701
<i>I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.</i>

723
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,496
<i>I will stay ahead of her this time.</i>

724
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,498
- You're home early.
- Hey.

725
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,958
There you are. Did you not get my texts?

726
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,919
We need to talk.

727
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,064
<i>She knows.
How the hell could she already know?</i>

728
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,589
- Is everything okay?
- No.

729
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,550
Theo told me that Matthew hired a PI
to look into people.

730
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,761
He doesn't think Natalie's case is closed.

731
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,554
Okay. So, what does he have?

732
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
I don't know,
but I may be able to find out.

733
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,059
- How?
- We know Theo has a crush on me...

734
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,480
- And you wanna use that?
- Sort of.

735
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,650
Like, okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can shoot it down.

736
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:51,905
But I could... pretend
like he had a chance.

737
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:55,117
Like, 19-year-olds will do anything
if they think sex is on the table.

738
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,035
<i>Well, this took a turn,</i>

739
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,206
<i>but if Love's focused on this,
she'll be too distracted to notice us.</i>

740
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:05,127
I know, I was... It's crazy,
and I'm asking you for a lot of trust,

741
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,753
- but I really...
- It's a great idea.

742
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,966
I trust you.

743
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,759
We are a team.

744
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,511
The best team.

745
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,477
<i>We are the best team.</i>

746
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,565
<i>Even if we're not soul mates,
it's a kind of love.</i>

747
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:32,028
<i>And it keeps her eyes somewhere else,
so the rest I can give to you.</i>

748
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,031
<i>This is great for everyone.</i>
