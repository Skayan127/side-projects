1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,768
<i>Dostoevsky wrote,</i>

2
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>"If a man has a conscience,
he will suffer for his mistake.</i>

3
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>That will be his punishment
as well as his prison."</i>

4
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,781
Everything's gonna be okay.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,702
What did you do?

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,330
Why are you looking at me like that?

7
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,291
I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,002
Why? I mean, she was crazy.

9
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,754
She was gonna hurt you.

10
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,088
And us.

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,673
And I fixed it.

12
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,384
We can be together now.

13
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,346
I don't think we can.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,476
I think I broke you.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,478
- I'm fine.
- Listen to me.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,314
This is not your fault.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,316
This is not you.

18
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,069
Everything I told you is true.

19
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,821
Beck, Henderson,

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
Delilah...

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,576
I killed them.

22
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,287
Their blood is on my hands.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,373
Joe.

24
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,127
You didn't kill Delilah.

25
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,797
I did.

26
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,779
- <i>You know that old cliché...</i>
- You're a sneaky, manipulative bitch.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>"You can choose your friends,
but you can’t choose your family."</i>

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,101
<i>My brother
and I learned that lesson early.</i>

29
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,811
We can still enjoy what we have, right?

30
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,607
<i>Absentee parents, too self-absorbed
to notice a fox in the henhouse.</i>

31
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,526
- Hold on, what are you...
- Shh.

32
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,655
<i>Nobody to show us
what healthy caretaking should look like.</i>

33
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,448
<i>Forty was a child.</i>

34
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,909
<i>She was a rapist.</i>

35
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,786
<i>I stopped her.</i>

36
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,253
I protected Forty because I had to.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>Because nobody else was.</i>

38
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,598
<i>Better they thought it was him.</i>

39
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>Forty was blacked out, a victim.</i>

40
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,188
<i>They’d cover it up,
coddle him like always.</i>

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,025
<i>I could stay close, protect him.</i>

42
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,527
We need utter privacy...

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>But families don’t heal
from something like that.</i>

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>So I began to fantasize about a new one.</i>

45
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>If we were ever lucky enough to have it.</i>

46
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,832
<i>When James died,</i>

47
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,169
<i>I wondered if the family I had
was the only one I deserved.</i>

48
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
And then I saw you.

49
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,134
<i>I knew right away, in my gut,</i>

50
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,469
<i>I recognized something in you. And, hey,</i>

51
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>smart, sexy, funny,</i>

52
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:06,436
<i>a little darkness that made you
less storybook, more real.</i>

53
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,397
<i>I started to fantasize again.</i>

54
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,193
<i>When you pulled away,
I told myself, "I can fix him."</i>

55
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>For a while, it was working.</i>

56
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,615
<i>I showed you how to heal.</i>

57
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,535
<i>Oh, you were stronger than I knew.</i>

58
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:28,499
<i>I showed you what I wanted
by showing you what I didn’t want.</i>

59
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>When you stood by me, united,</i>

60
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,049
<i>I knew together we could be better
than the family I was born into.</i>

61
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,303
I wolf you.

62
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,013
I wolf you too.

63
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,477
Maybe I got a little obsessed.

64
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,190
<i>Maybe I used my parents' means
to do a little digging after Candace left.</i>

65
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,152
<i>They owed me that much.</i>

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,531
<i>I devoured your dead ex’s book,
front to back.</i>

67
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>All the articles, all the think pieces,</i>

68
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,535
<i>reading between the lines.</i>

69
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>And I realized,
Guinevere Beck was unspecial and mediocre.</i>

70
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,751
She didn’t deserve you.

71
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,724
<i>And then,</i>

72
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,436
<i>I found the real you, Joe.</i>

73
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
<i>You were even smarter,</i>

74
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,068
<i>more passionate,
more devoted than I’d known.</i>

75
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,030
<i>You’re crafty...</i>

76
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>and earthy.</i>

77
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,914
<i>And it must be said, you bring out genius.</i>

78
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,334
<i>Don’t think Beck could’ve written that
in a million years without your push.</i>

79
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,421
<i>Yeah, you did some terrible things,</i>

80
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,358
<i>but that’s what sensitive people do
when they’re trapped</i>

81
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,842
<i>in a bad relationship.</i>

82
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>I tried to coax the real you out.</i>

83
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,098
<i>If you could trust me,</i>

84
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>show me your heart,
even the darkest parts,</i>

85
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,522
<i>then we’d be starting our future together
on the right foot.</i>

86
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>But then, Delilah.</i>

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,527
<i>She found out who you were and recoiled.</i>

88
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>You lost faith.</i>

89
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>You were gonna give up on us.</i>

90
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,034
<i>Our little family in the making.</i>

91
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,702
So I followed you.

92
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,704
Take this.

93
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,956
Give it to Delilah.

94
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
And when you fuck her,

95
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,420
you think of me. Okay?

96
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,213
Oh, thank God!
Oh, please, you have to help me.

97
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,341
Listen, Will is insane!

98
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,344
- Oh, my God.
- These handcuffs, I think there's a key.

99
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,547
I don't know if Will has it,

100
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,305
or if there's a spare.
I really don't know.

101
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,433
I promised him I wouldn't say anything
about what he did,

102
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,310
but I really don't think he believes me,

103
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,955
and so I really need your help.
I need to get out of here, please.

104
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,607
He said he'd be back later.
He's high on something.

105
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,193
Please, just hurry.
He'll hurt me, he'll hurt both of us.

106
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,154
Just hurry. Please just help me
before he gets back.

107
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,413
<i>I dealt with Delilah the same
way I dealt with the au pair.</i>

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>I’m protecting you because I want to, Joe.</i>

109
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,421
You didn't break me.

110
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,466
You opened your heart to me.

111
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,180
We're soulmates, Joe.

112
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,186
<i>What the fuck?</i>

113
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,903
Joe?

114
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,700
Please, say something.

115
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,124
What about Ellie?

116
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,047
Ellie? We have to talk about your sister.

117
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,928
Hey.

118
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,933
- It's okay, all right? I come in peace.
- At, like, three in the morning.

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,017
I mean, come on.

120
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
Do you know
Delilah's been getting death threats?

121
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,106
Yeah, I do.

122
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,608
And I was actually thinkingthat you might
be able to help me out with that.

123
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
How?

124
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,405
Uh...

125
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,287
I don't know, just walk me through
some of the stuff around Henderson.

126
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,081
Anything you might remember
that stands out.

127
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,167
No detail too small.

128
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,253
That sound chill?

129
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,715
I know this routine
from every movie I've ever seen.

130
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,384
You're trying to entrap me.

131
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,844
<i>Ellie's gonna be fine.</i>

132
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,430
And you don't think I would... You know...

133
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
If I didn't have a plan for her.

134
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,061
Oh, you have a plan?

135
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,104
It's simple.

136
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,901
First, we make Ellie a suspect
in Henderson's murder.

137
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,028
- What?
- Don't judge yet, okay?

138
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,196
Let me finish.

139
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,989
Step one,

140
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,953
we frame Ellie for Henderson's murder
with an anonymous tip.

141
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,622
Love, tell me you didn't already do that.

142
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,543
Where were you
the night Henderson was murdered, Ellie?

143
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,588
Yeah, Delilah's been protecting you.

144
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,050
Your texts with Henderson show
that he already had plans that night.

145
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,680
And a new tip places you
in his house the night he died.

146
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,598
I didn't do anything.

147
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,517
I just wanna take you down to the station,

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,977
ask you a few questions.

149
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>Step two</i>

150
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,982
is lawyer her up
with the Quinn family's finest.

151
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,025
Between the total lack of evidence

152
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,987
and the fact
that she's a 15-year-old girl,

153
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,281
it instantly becomes a joke.

154
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,995
I'm letting you finish.

155
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,913
Well...

156
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,252
that's when Delilah's body
will be found with a suicide note.

157
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:53,134
She becomes a posthumous feminist icon
for taking down her abuser.

158
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,304
The shock waves will destroy the case.

159
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,427
Ellie will walk free
with settlement money for life.

160
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,309
She could even use this scandal
to jump-start her career.

161
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,060
And most importantly,

162
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,439
the investigation becomes poisoned.

163
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,109
And you are never mentioned in connection
with Henderson again.

164
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,487
That will never work.

165
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,156
I mean, it wouldn't...

166
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,908
if my family didn't basically own
the LAPD.

167
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,162
It's the way the <i>au pair</i> got cleaned up.

168
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:27,001
Ellie is going to emerge stronger,
smarter,

169
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,420
- and better off.
- Like Forty?

170
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,048
- Watch it.
- Okay, Ellie, then.

171
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,676
What kind of sick mind
thinks forcing a teenager

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,429
into the system is doing her a favor?

173
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,140
If you have a better idea,
I'm open to that.

174
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,559
I'm sorry, it's very hard to think clearly

175
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,770
in the river of crazy you're spewing!

176
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,688
Okay, get a grip.

177
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,651
I thought you were the last person
who'd be hysterical.

178
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,320
Hysterical? You killed Delilah!

179
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,073
Because you killed a fucking celebrity.

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
You know why this is happening?

181
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,244
Because while I was seeing you,

182
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,289
really seeing you,

183
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,459
you were busy gazing at a goddamn fantasy.

184
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,592
A perfectly imperfect girl.

185
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,721
You saw what you wanted to see.

186
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,809
But I was always right here,

187
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,936
the whole time.

188
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,523
It wasn't that hard.

189
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,484
You just had to look.

190
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,414
Um...

191
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,917
I have to finish making a wedding cake,
so...

192
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,462
Love. Love! Wait, wait, wait! Please.

193
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,965
Please, let me out.

194
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,302
Love? Love!

195
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,981
<i>A crazy person has locked me in
a cage, but now is not the time to panic.</i>

196
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>Ellie's in danger.</i>

197
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,817
<i>Is she, though?
What if Love's plan is good?</i>

198
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,612
<i>She sounded sincere. Slow down.
Think. Okay.</i>

199
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:24,827
<i>Now... do I believe Love
has Ellie's best interests at heart?</i>

200
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,665
<i>Nope. Okay. I have to get free.
That's clear. Simple. Impossible.</i>

201
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,003
<i>I think I finally understand
what Beck went through.</i>

202
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,964
<i>It </i>is <i>a lot to process.</i>

203
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,385
<i>What did Beck do in this situation?</i>

204
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,262
<i>- I love you.
- Right.</i>

205
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,639
<i>She pretended to love me.</i>

206
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,518
<i>All I ever wanted
from Beck was to be seen.</i>

207
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,438
<i>Really seen and accepted.</i>

208
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,900
<i>You saw me.
Even the parts I'm ashamed of.</i>

209
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:01,113
<i>You're asking me to see you,
to love you.</i>

210
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,908
<i>I don't know what to feel, Love.</i>

211
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,243
<i>But I know what to do.</i>

212
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>Are you in trouble for the gun?</i>

213
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,080
Not at all.

214
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,666
So, we can be together forever?

215
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,092
I love you so much, Joey. So, so much.

216
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,225
<i>It isn't hard to convince somebody
you love them</i>

217
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,477
<i>if you know what they want to hear.</i>

218
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,487
Have a good one, mate.

219
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,535
- D-FOL mobile production office.
<i>- Forty, thank God.</i>

220
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,870
Listen, I’m at the police station
right now,

221
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,705
and they're not letting me leave.

222
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,332
I need you to bail me out

223
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,292
or whatever you did
for Will and my sister.

224
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,460
Wait, Ellie?

225
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,754
- What did you do?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

226
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,549
It has something to do with Henderson,
but I didn’t do anything.

227
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,676
<i>This cop Delilah knows brought me here,</i>

228
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,928
<i>and the guy who keeps trying
to ask me stuff,</i>

229
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,513
<i>I think he’s a homicide detective.</i>

230
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,434
Please. Delilah's missing.

231
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,770
Can you just come down
to the Wilcox station?

232
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,730
<i>No can do, I’m on the East Coast.</i>

233
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,399
Are you serious?

234
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,151
Sit tight, okay?
I'm gonna send Morris your way.

235
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,195
<i>- Who’s Morris?</i>
- He's a family lawyer

236
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,365
on call for DUIs, D and Ds,
and bailouts under $600K.

237
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,700
He'll have you out in no time.

238
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,327
Forty, things are getting weird.

239
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,706
Hey, I promise. I’ve got your back, okay?

240
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,416
Just say nothing,

241
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>act dumb, and don't drink anything,</i>

242
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,628
'cause they'll steal your DNA.

243
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,522
Dr. Nicky. Hi, I’m Forty Quinn,

244
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,692
I'm the writer/producer
of the upcoming feature-length adaptation

245
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,254
of Guinevere Beck’s <i>The Dark Face of Love,</i>
directed by Kathryn Bigelow...

246
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,655
Yeah, that's great.
Could we just get to it, please?

247
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,559
The only reason why I'm here
is because the warden made me.

248
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,452
I'm assuming you bribed him.

249
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,496
Okay, brass tacks. I like that.

250
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,791
I'll just say it then.
I don't think you killed Guinevere Beck.

251
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,251
No shit.

252
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,089
Are you one of those fans,
the "Free Dr. Nicky" subreddit?

253
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,760
Former patients, conspiracy nuts.

254
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,554
Listen to me carefully.

255
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,474
Nothing they say matters.

256
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,684
They say that you're innocent.

257
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,771
Don't you want to go free?

258
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,855
No.

259
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,943
I'm guilty of destroying my marriage,

260
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,780
my wife, my kids.

261
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,784
I didn't kill Beck, but I am guilty.

262
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,703
I'm guilty of using her.

263
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,580
And she's not the first. She's...

264
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,875
She's the...
She's just the first to end up dead.

265
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,420
No, I'm a bad person.

266
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,715
I'm exactly where I deserve to be.

267
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,097
Wow, this is... not what I pictured
when I was writing you.

268
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,810
I expected more
of a wrongfully-convicted vibe.

269
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,893
I've had all that.

270
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,312
But by the grace of God,

271
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,357
I've been given eyes to see things
a whole other way.

272
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,986
You see, I've turned my body and my spirit

273
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,030
- over to a higher power.
- Yeah, me too, bro. All the steps.

274
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,573
I'm good, Mr. Quinn.

275
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,536
You know why?
'Cause I'm walking with Christ.

276
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,454
And if I repent,

277
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,725
- I will be forgiven in the end.
- Meanwhile, there's a killer out there.

278
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,752
Oh, there's evil everywhere in the world,
you see.

279
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,090
But I prefer to deal with the evil
that I see in the mirror each day.

280
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,842
Dope. Um...

281
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,262
You're not curious
about the mystery patient of yours

282
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,681
with the fake name
that could never be located?

283
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,184
Yes, I read the subreddit, okay?
It's fucking research.

284
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,146
I don't want to bring a whole media circus

285
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,309
down on a guy
who's just trying to work his shit out.

286
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,527
That...

287
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,071
That's Paul Brown.

288
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,659
Yeah. He told us his name was Will,
but his real name...

289
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,743
Stop.

290
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,873
If you're right,
you stay away from that man.

291
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,333
No, no. We can stop him.

292
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,085
No, no, no, no.

293
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,378
If he killed Beck...

294
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,215
there's no telling
what this man is capable of.

295
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,802
What's done is done.
He'll be punished, but not by us.

296
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,596
Trust in divine justice.

297
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,559
Put your faith in the universe, man.
It's the only thing that'll set you free.

298
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,936
Cool. Will do.

299
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,229
One problem.

300
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:49,568
He's dating my fucking sister, Reverend.

301
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:54,239
So, why don't you just tell me everything
that you know?

302
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,950
Or her death will be on you.

303
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,291
God bless you, and God bless your sister.

304
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,672
Fuck.

305
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,568
<i>Amy turned me onto this memoir.</i>

306
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,595
This, uh, main character, Beck.

307
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,347
It's Joe.

308
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,168
Shall we?

309
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,550
See you soon, Ms. Alves.

310
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,176
Yeah, have fun.

311
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,471
Oh, and one more thing.

312
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,016
Wherever your sister is,
she’s got 12 hours to show her face,

313
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,853
or I’m calling CPS
on an unattended minor.

314
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,104
You know,

315
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,774
in addition to the missing persons report
I just filed.

316
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,235
Can he do that?

317
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,530
Let’s talk outside.

318
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,719
Just give it a minute.

319
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,888
It’s the Quinn family.

320
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,849
Yeah, well,
they always have a lot going on.

321
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,561
She might not stay
front of mind for too long.

322
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,979
You know what?

323
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,773
My schedule's clear.

324
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,331
There's no harm in putting a tail on her.

325
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,866
If I see anything fun, I'll call you.

326
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,827
Muffins?

327
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,254
Yeah, I, uh...
seem to remember owing you one.

328
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,717
I didn't have time to make a religieuse.

329
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,520
The first time I ever tasted a muffin...

330
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,356
was in a group home.

331
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
My mom never let me have one, ever.

332
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,696
Wow, that's basically child abuse.

333
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,449
And she said, "They're cupcakes, Joey.
Read the ingredients."

334
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,952
Well, she wasn't wrong.

335
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,039
- You never talk about her. Is she still...
- Alive?

336
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,916
Around.

337
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,257
She was a saint.

338
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,885
I was a handful.

339
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,139
It seems like you just wanted sugar
for breakfast.

340
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,225
Like a normal kid.

341
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,854
- At least you had her around back then.
- She did her best.

342
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,822
What are...

343
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,993
Are you fucking kidding me?

344
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,544
Is this what you're afraid of?

345
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,796
No poison, Joe!

346
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,298
No, no no no. Love. Love?

347
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,675
- You think I'm crazy.
- It's not that.

348
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,303
No. I didn't want to say anything.

349
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,678
About what?

350
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,389
I can't eat food

351
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,894
when there's a body rotting
three feet away from me.

352
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,479
I do need to eat.

353
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,400
Just open the cage.

354
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,155
Only long enough for me to move her out.

355
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,202
Love, I do trust you.

356
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,039
I need you to trust me.

357
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,890
I do.

358
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,959
Joe. No!

359
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,670
No, I'm pregnant!

360
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,305
I'm pregnant.

361
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,350
<i>Joey...</i>

362
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,269
Joey, I know you're in there.

363
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,769
Joseph.

364
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,441
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

365
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,818
Why are you hiding, bub?

366
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,820
He's here to take me away.

367
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,114
Just... for a little while.

368
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,452
I'm not... the best for you right now.

369
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,079
What happened. This is better.

370
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,126
Why did you let him come back
over and over again?

371
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,130
So you could have a dad.

372
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,715
You need a father.

373
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,301
I only need you.

374
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,678
I don't expect you to understand this,

375
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,097
but a boy needs a strong man

376
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,099
to teach him right from wrong.

377
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,478
I tried to give you that, but I failed.

378
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,689
What's wrong with you, it's my fault.

379
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,315
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,694
You needed a real father.

381
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,117
<i>A father.</i>

382
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,830
<i>I'm going to be a real father.</i>

383
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,416
Are you sure it's...?

384
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,251
I made Milo use protection.

385
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,550
Joe... Joe.

386
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,684
Say something.

387
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,145
Right.

388
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,024
Right, you think I'm a psycho now.

389
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:33,031
Did you actually believe
I wanted to hurt anyone?

390
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,743
I hated doing that to Delilah.

391
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:41,289
I'd just taken the test.
I had just found out.

392
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:46,753
I mean, was I gonna let this destroy
our baby's life?

393
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,214
My whole life...

394
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,386
I've been doing what it takes...

395
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,723
when I love someone.

396
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,729
And I love you.

397
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,942
I love you.

398
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,405
I don't know what to say.

399
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,865
Say, "Love, I get it."

400
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,909
Say, "Love,

401
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:24,082
we both had to learn how to survive
really young."

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,168
I mean, how old were you the first time?

403
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,086
Nine.

404
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,714
I'm so sorry.

405
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,303
You were just a child.

406
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,804
So were you.

407
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,306
So is she.

408
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,682
She?

409
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,809
It's just a feeling.

410
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,061
<i>A daughter. A girl.</i>

411
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,981
I was stupid to think
you would forgive me.

412
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,818
I had to tell myself you would
so that I could go through with it.

413
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,904
But you hate me now.

414
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,989
Love...

415
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,493
If you want to hate me...

416
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,788
run...

417
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,043
turn me in...

418
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,501
hurt me...

419
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,964
just fucking do it.

420
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,016
I'm not gonna keep you here.

421
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,562
<i>Candace said I'd face myself.</i>

422
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,147
<i>Maybe this is it.</i>

423
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,983
<i>Facing you.</i>

424
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,702
This...

425
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,500
It's not covered
in any sort of dating manual.

426
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,210
That's very true.

427
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,883
I understand if you can't love me anymore.

428
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,220
Or don't want to.

429
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,272
I do want to.

430
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,566
Real love doesn't evaporate

431
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,361
when things get hard.

432
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,571
I will earn back your trust.

433
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,409
I will do whatever it takes.

434
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,329
Nothing is more important than this.

435
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,503
Is it weird if I ask if you still want
to go to Lucy and Sunrise's wedding?

436
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,432
<i>♪ Got my eyes on the face
of the danger in you ♪</i>

437
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,020
<i>So, this is, in fact,
a little weird.</i>

438
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,731
<i>Ellie's not answering.</i>

439
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,317
<i>I can't exactly peel away to look
for her yet.</i>

440
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,868
<i>You don't trust me.</i>

441
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,038
<i>And why would you?
Even I don't know how I feel.</i>

442
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,209
<i>How can I judge anything you've done,</i>

443
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,963
<i>when it was not so different
from the things I've done?</i>

444
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:22,594
<i>But if I let myself forgive
and just be happy with you,</i>

445
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,680
<i>with all the light and good
that comes with your bad,</i>

446
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,684
<i>what kind of father does that make me?</i>

447
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,935
No! I'm sorry.

448
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,939
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Gabe! I need to speak to my sister.

449
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,524
Right fucking now!

450
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,488
Okay, then you are gonna
have to call her later.

451
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,694
Is she with Joe?

452
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,782
Will fucking Talented Mr. Ripley?
Okay, look! Listen to me!

453
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,741
She's in danger.

454
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,660
- You are back on the hard stuff...
- I'm sober, you asshole.

455
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,872
Okay, this is a sacred day, and your drama
is not gonna get in the way.

456
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,957
I cannot deal with... No, Forty!

457
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,041
Look, hey, Forty!

458
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,668
- God! Your sober coach...
- Love!

459
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,462
...will be here in ten.

460
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,798
With love, Forty, grow up.

461
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,383
Yeah, crack again.

462
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,593
Fuck you.

463
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,517
Can't fix everyone.

464
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,727
<i>Love makes you do some crazy shit.</i>

465
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,773
Like move across the country
for a girl you barely know,

466
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,484
who already has a girlfriend...

467
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,904
<i>No one could accuse you
of being cold, Love.</i>

468
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,739
<i>Of having no heart.</i>

469
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,033
I remember the first time I saw you
at work.

470
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:32,956
You were screaming at a studio exec,
like some goddess of destruction,

471
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,833
and I was like...

472
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,335
"She scares me.

473
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,840
She will burn it all down
for what she cares about."

474
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,344
That's the moment I saw what
and who you are.

475
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,222
It's also the moment
I fell in love with you.

476
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,558
My queen,

477
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,354
together we will raise children
who fear nothing.

478
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,024
Whose hearts are the size of the moon.

479
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,569
And who are real and true.

480
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,153
Like you.

481
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:11,202
All I've ever wanted is to love
and be loved by someone real and true.

482
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,537
<i>Me too.</i>

483
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,163
You're my soulmate.

484
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,166
- Yes, I am.
- Beautiful.

485
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,793
<i>Is that what we are?</i>

486
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,671
<i>- Soulmates?</i>
- I love you, baby.

487
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,506
<i>Is this what real love is?</i>

488
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,925
<i>Knowing and accepting anything.</i>

489
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,969
I love you so much.

490
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,849
- Your vows are better than mine.
- No, they weren't!

491
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,852
- I mean it.
- <i>I </i>mean it.

492
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,563
Well, by the power vested in me

493
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,232
by the Divine Mother
and the state of California,

494
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,943
I now pronounce you...

495
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,112
married.

496
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,322
Ah!

497
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,952
Go on, kiss her. Come on!

498
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,579
- Do it!
- Kiss her!

499
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,046
<i>We're having a little girl together.</i>

500
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,425
<i>I am terrified,
but maybe that's how every parent feels.</i>

501
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:11,387
<i>All I know is,
I can't protect her if I'm not there,</i>

502
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,099
<i>and I won't be there if I can't love you.</i>

503
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,183
What?

504
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,185
I love you.

505
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,105
You do?

506
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,689
Yes.

507
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,360
Still?

508
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
More.

509
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,341
Close the store and leave.

510
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,427
- It's the middle of the day.
- Calvin, just...

511
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,973
put up a "closed for inventory" sign
and get the fuck out.

512
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,558
Whatever you say.

513
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,812
Yeah, thanks for the tone. You're fired!

514
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,564
Good.

515
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,525
As a courtesy, I'll evacuate everyone

516
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,444
before their pathetic junkie boss
fires them, too.

517
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,166
Oh, my!

518
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:29,048
Okay, okay, okay, you jerks.
You can totally turn on your phones now,

519
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,509
and if we could gather
for the most gorgeous cake

520
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,302
you've ever seen in your life,

521
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,472
courtesy of Ms. Love Quinn.

522
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,099
Yeah!

523
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,247
Okay, I'll go in, calm him down a little.

524
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,041
Give me five minutes
then follow me, okay?

525
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,917
Five minutes. Trust me.

526
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,973
Ellie.

527
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,310
Ellie, I've been worried.

528
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,519
Don't come near me!

529
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,689
What's going on?
Did Forty say something crazy about me?

530
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,333
Because he's been doing that all day.
He's not in his right mind.

531
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,527
You know me.

532
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,697
Please, I can help.

533
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,659
I don't know where to go.

534
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,246
Cops are sending CPS to my house.

535
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,082
Forty told me to meet him here,

536
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,959
but he's in there ranting
on Love's voicemail,

537
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,203
- and he's scary.
- It's okay.

538
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,922
- Love and I are gonna take care of that.
- He's ranting about you,

539
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,632
saying you killed Beck,

540
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,426
and that you tried burying
someone named Candace alive.

541
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,594
Does that sound like me?

542
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,596
- Why would he think that?
- He's high.

543
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,972
Where is my sister, Will?

544
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,060
I don't care about the rest of it,
I don't.

545
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,312
Where is Delilah?

546
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,692
- Did you hurt her, Will?
- No.

547
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,319
Then where is she?

548
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,574
Ellie, this is my fault.

549
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,744
The Quinns are very powerful,

550
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,413
and they get away with evil things.

551
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,874
I got wrapped up with them...

552
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,376
and so did your sister.

553
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,378
So, what?
They're, like, out of <i>The Godfather </i>now?

554
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,716
Ellie,
I don't think Delilah is coming back.

555
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,513
- What?
- I wish it was any other way,

556
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,933
but we need to protect you
and get you away from them.

557
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
- My sister...
- Is gone.

558
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,402
You cannot go home.

559
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,571
CPS is not great either.

560
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,907
Come with me.

561
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,084
- Look, you need to go.
- Okay, breathe.

562
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,808
- No, listen.
- You're a little worked up.

563
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,730
- Sit down!
- No, for the last time, I'm not high!

564
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm... I'm not.

565
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,882
Is Joe...

566
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,967
Did you read my texts?

567
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,636
You can't even finish a thought.

568
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,097
No, okay, Love. I will say this nicely,

569
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,808
I will do breathwork with you later.

570
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:32,190
I have to save you from
a literal fucking serial killer first.

571
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,691
I'm handling it.

572
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,193
Please, go.

573
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,694
Okay.

574
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,781
I trust you. Whatever you want, I'll go.

575
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,575
But before I do,

576
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,203
just for my peace of mind...

577
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,831
walk me through the plan?

578
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,421
Okay, take this.

579
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,299
Go out the side doors
in case someone follows you.

580
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,551
Go to Union Station, get on a train east.

581
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,928
Keep going east, okay?

582
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,780
- When you get where you're going, call me.
- Where am I going?

583
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,015
- To start your life.
- I have a life.

584
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,478
Ellie, you are one of the smartest people
I've ever met.

585
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,104
- You can do this.
- Do what?

586
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,898
Start over.

587
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,691
Find a city.

588
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,860
- Florida might be a good place to start.
- I'm 15.

589
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,779
Basically 16, right?

590
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,365
When you get there,
I will help you get legal ID.

591
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,909
I will send you money
as long as you need it.

592
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,992
I will not abandon you.

593
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,330
- Then what the fuck is this?
- This is what we need to do!

594
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,750
I hate you.

595
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,629
You brought the Quinns into our lives,

596
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,881
and you're the reason Delilah's gone.

597
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,886
Dead, right?

598
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,221
She's dead?

599
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,057
I'm sorry, Ellie.

600
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,851
And now you come in here
acting like some kind of hero?

601
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,813
Well, fuck you. Fuck you!

602
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,607
I am not a hero. Believe me.
You want the truth?

603
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,151
I killed Henderson,

604
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,945
and I don't feel guilty about it.

605
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,490
What I am is all that stands between you
and people who are worse.

606
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,158
Now let me help you.

607
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,372
You ruined my life.

608
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,959
I am truly sorry. Side door.

609
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,137
Burn in hell.

610
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,100
<i>She should hate me.</i>

611
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,728
<i>But as long as she's safe.</i>

612
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,355
<i>Is this what fatherhood feels like?</i>

613
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,941
<i>Why are you protecting him?</i>

614
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,777
Why aren't you listening to me?

615
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,238
Because you let people
get in your head, Forty.

616
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,032
No... no.

617
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,035
I have cracked this, okay?
I can see the Matrix,

618
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,704
and it is exactly what Candace tried
to tell us.

619
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,955
Look around him.

620
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,999
People disappear.

621
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,917
People die in weird fucking ways.

622
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,628
First, it was Beck and her friends,

623
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,006
and now Ellie's sister is missing.

624
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,260
Henderson was murdered,
and we had just been at his house.

625
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,055
- All right? Look, Candace told...
- Candace was crazy!

626
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,891
Listen to yourself,
you sound like a conspiracy nutjob.

627
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,184
You have blind spots.

628
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,728
Joe, he's in your blind spot.

629
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:20,566
He is a blood-thirsty wolf
in your blind spot.

630
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,946
Joe, you're late.

631
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,408
- Come in.
- Joe, you can just wait outside...

632
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,576
No, no.

633
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,912
I insist.

634
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,793
Here's the deal. Our family,
we can make your life a living hell.

635
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:43,214
We can get you sent to prison.
And we can do a lot fucking worse.

636
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,883
Okay, well, I don't know what it is
you think I did,

637
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,552
so tell me, and we can talk about it.

638
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,140
Which part? The part
where you have a pattern of lying

639
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,436
and stalking and killing in general?

640
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,649
Or the part where you fixated
on my sister?

641
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,484
I will never hurt Love.

642
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,779
- You are never going to get to.
- Okay, this is enough.

643
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,990
Okay? Joe, we can let him simmer down.

644
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:10,950
- No, Forty!
- Hey!

645
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,993
- Stand back.
- Oh, my God. Put that away!

646
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,497
- Don't be insane!
- This is the sanest I have ever been.

647
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,792
You protect me, I protect you.

648
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,295
Forty... let's talk.

649
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,756
Joe, if you take another step,
I will shoot you.

650
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,260
Love, for the last time, go.

651
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,388
You don't want to hurt him.

652
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,889
Yes, I do.

653
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,893
And if you would listen to me,
you would understand why I have to.

654
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,814
Forty, if you do this,
I will never forgive you.

655
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,066
You will never see me again

656
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,401
or the baby.

657
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,573
Our baby.

658
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,284
A little girl.

659
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,080
- You're...?
- Yeah.

660
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,084
Do you actually think
I would let Joe near me

661
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,919
if I didn't think, in my heart,

662
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,547
that he was worthy of being a part
of our family?

663
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,341
What the fuck is wrong with you?

664
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,679
You would bring a child
into this world like... like us?

665
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,474
- That is your shitty self-esteem talking.
- No.

666
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,606
You are just as broken as I am.

667
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,650
You're just a much better liar.

668
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,027
Jesus, Love...

669
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,695
you think I don't know?

670
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:34,617
After all of these years,
you really think that I am that dumb?

671
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,870
That I don't know what you're capable of?

672
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:43,626
I have tip-toed around it my entire life,

673
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,004
and it has eaten me alive.

674
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,172
I love you,

675
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,259
but you are crazy

676
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,054
if you think that you would be
a good mother.

677
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:01,101
Forty, don't punish your sister
because you're angry with me.

678
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,561
You're right,

679
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,523
I have done terrible things...

680
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,025
in the past.

681
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,904
What I care about now is her

682
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,155
and our child

683
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,615
and you.

684
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,160
You think...

685
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,083
that knocking up my sister
makes you a new person?

686
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,213
No.

687
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,759
I don't.

688
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:38,138
- No.
- Get on your knees, psycho.

689
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,557
Forty...

690
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:51,443
<i>Dostoevsky contended
the bad want to be punished.</i>

691
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,279
- Forty, please.
- Stay back, Love.

692
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,031
I said, stay back.

693
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,706
<i>If the bad are not caught,</i>

694
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,749
<i>they'll seek out their own punishment,</i>

695
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,418
<i>one way or another.</i>

696
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,673
Close your eyes, Joe.

697
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,726
<i>At least some punishment is quick.</i>

698
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>Oh, no.</i>

699
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,452
Oh, no.

700
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,376
<i>And some punishment will never end.</i>

701
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,502
Are you two okay?

702
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,757
Oh, my God.
If I was one second later...

703
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,570
Officer involved in a shooting. Man down.

704
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,847
Send an ambulance to Anavrin.
I need a sergeant to respond.

705
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,017
- Forty...
<i>- I saw the moment you knew...</i>

706
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,227
<i>your brother was gone,</i>

707
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,146
<i>and I saw you look at me.</i>

708
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:15,069
<i>I knew, in that moment,
that you needed me</i>

709
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,238
<i>like I've never been needed,
and you always will.</i>

710
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,076
<i>Sometimes, a man gets exactly
what he wishes for,</i>

711
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,122
<i>and that can be
the most perfect punishment of all.</i>

712
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,131
No!

713
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,343
No!

714
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,564
<i>So, karma and I, we're in a fight.</i>

715
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,901
<i>Some people, they get what they deserve.</i>

716
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,487
<i>Some people don't.</i>

717
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,369
<i>And each day that passes,</i>

718
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:11,041
<i>justice seems more and more
like a literary conceit.</i>

719
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:29,268
<i>In </i>Crime and Punishment,
<i>the hero willingly walks into exile.</i>

720
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,396
<i>He is killed, but he's also found love.</i>

721
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,524
<i>And if he repents, he can be redeemed.</i>

722
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,193
<i>He and the woman he loves can be saved.</i>

723
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:37,252
<i>You can't save someone from
themselves. We wanted to... with Forty.</i>

724
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,129
<i>The grief was rough at first,</i>

725
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,257
<i>but his last gift to me
was when heroic Officer Fincher</i>

726
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,343
<i>started to look at him
for Henderson's murder.</i>

727
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:50,974
<i>The Quinn machine shut it down,
made any future investigation radioactive.</i>

728
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,060
<i>Side effect wiped my slate clean.</i>

729
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,940
<i>Not that the real slate can ever be clean.</i>

730
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,696
<i>But it's hard to stay sad...</i>

731
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,407
<i>when there's new life growing.</i>

732
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,874
<i>And here I am.</i>

733
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,168
<i>No one can absolve me.</i>

734
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,921
<i>I gotta do the time.</i>

735
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,518
<i>Not every Siberia is cold.</i>

736
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,063
<i>Some are 73 and sunny
with eco-conscious landscaping.</i>

737
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,529
<i>I'm ready to meet my daughter.</i>

738
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,699
<i>I'm ready to be the good father
I never had.</i>

739
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,909
<i>To make the family I always dreamed of.</i>

740
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,619
<i>The one she deserves.</i>

741
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,330
<i>It's funny how fate works.</i>

742
00:47:55,414 --> 00:48:00,752
<i>I had no idea that the cage I was building
all this time was a trap for me.</i>

743
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:05,257
<i>And when I found myself here, locked in,
I thought this was the end.</i>

744
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,517
<i>But that's not how destiny
works, is it?</i>

745
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,104
<i>This is just the beginning...</i>

746
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:24,276
<i>because this is where I had to be,
exactly...</i>

747
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,987
<i>where I had to be to meet...</i>

748
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,779
<i>you.</i>

749
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,198
<i>There you were,</i>

750
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,493
<i>with your books and your sunshine.</i>

751
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,164
<i>So close, but worlds away.</i>

752
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,251
<i>I will figure out a way,
a way to get to you.</i>

753
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,880
<i>See you soon... neighbor.</i>

754
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,360
