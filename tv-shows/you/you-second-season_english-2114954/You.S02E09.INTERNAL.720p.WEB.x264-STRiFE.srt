1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>We're friends, Delilah.
We're good friends.</i>

2
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,884
I'm not going to hurt you.

3
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,052
Please!

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>But I wouldn't have. No.</i>

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>No, no... no.</i>

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,100
I don't want to die in here.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,518
You won't.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>I promised. I meant it.
I wouldn't have done this.</i>

9
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>I worked so hard for you, Love.</i>

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>This couldn't have been me.</i>

11
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>But she was a threat to us.</i>

12
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>She could've exposed me. Kept me from you.</i>

13
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>I had motive.</i>

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,660
I want to be with you.

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>No, it doesn't make sense.</i>

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,625
<i>Because if I did this,
I don't deserve you.</i>

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,295
<i>What it makes me, there could be no us.</i>

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,548
<i>I knew that. I knew that!</i>

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>The acid.</i>

20
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,514
<i>What happened last night?</i>

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>I have to know who killed Delilah.</i>

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,564
<i>Even if it was me.</i>

23
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,697
<i>The bar. We were at the bar.</i>

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>Everything was fine. And that was...
What? Eight-ish?</i>

25
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,916
Cheers!

26
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,252
That is the time
you started drinking.

27
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,795
You drugged me?

28
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,467
<i>Dosed, 8:52 p.m.</i>

29
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>And then things were not fine.
I don't know where or when the fuck I was.</i>

30
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,057
Are you really leaving LA?

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,061
My daughter's having
one of her drama queen days.

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>Too much time unaccounted for.</i>

33
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>That is time to murder.</i>

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,448
<i>If not, where was I?
What the hell was I doing?</i>

35
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,327
- <i>Go for Forty.</i>
- Forty, I am so glad I got you.

36
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,913
I was hoping that...

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,040
<i>Sucker. Leave a message.</i>

38
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,711
Hey, it's me. It's Joe.

39
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,007
Oh, what a night.

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,635
I wanted to check in on you,
so call me when you get this. Thanks.

41
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,888
<i>Okay, step one.</i>

42
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,892
<i>She needs to be alive.
I can't have people looking for her.</i>

43
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>Like Officer other David Fincher.</i>

44
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,649
<i>Shit. Ellie.</i>

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>No, I couldn't have done this to her.</i>

46
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,155
<i>Right. Facial recognition. That's great.</i>

47
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,448
<i>Let's go.</i>

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,734
Shit!

49
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,657
<i>I can't just leave her here.</i>

50
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>Whoever did this either left in a hurry
or just wanted this to be my mess.</i>

51
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>Is this a frame job?</i>

52
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,042
<i>Are the police on their way?</i>

53
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>I should run.</i>

54
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>No. I can't leave her here.</i>

55
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,882
<i>I can't leave her for anyone to find.</i>

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>I also can't move her in broad daylight.
I've got to wait till dark.</i>

57
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,514
<i>It's taking a chance either way,</i>

58
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,016
<i>but Los Angeles heat,</i>

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,435
<i>decomp's gonna happen fast.</i>

60
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>At best, buys five to six hours.
But I'll make the most of it.</i>

61
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>Figure out what the hell happened
last night.</i>

62
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,623
T, M.

63
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,460
Dude, slow down.
You'll be dead before you kiss the girl.

64
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,882
<i>He was the only one who knew
this was here.</i>

65
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,219
<i>I took his name. Caged him.</i>

66
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>I mean,
revenge wouldn't be out of the question.</i>

67
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,975
<i>Why kill Delilah, not me, though?</i>

68
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,644
You exposed us, and now they're...

69
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>Could have been off his meds. Right.</i>

70
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>Hello?</i>

71
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,747
<i>Kamusta?</i>

72
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,457
Uh, hi. I'm looking for Will.

73
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,793
Hello?

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,837
<i>He didn't give a real number</i>

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,006
<i>because he is not in Manila?</i>

76
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,175
<i>He was here, killing Delilah?</i>

77
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,552
<i>Hello, friend! What's up?</i>

78
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,803
Will!

79
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>Oh! See that? Living proof.</i>

80
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,641
<i>I have let people out of the cage,</i>

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,852
<i>made friends, even, from the experience.</i>

82
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,604
Was that Gigi who just picked up?

83
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,898
It's everything I told you, man.

84
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,524
I never doubted it.

85
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>Okay, I did. But I shouldn't have.</i>

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,154
<i>Like I shouldn't have considered Will
a suspect.</i>

87
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,655
<i>He is a good man.</i>

88
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,575
Why do you look like someone hit you
on the head with a rock,

89
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,202
threw you in the trunk of their car?

90
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>I'm tired, that's all.</i>

91
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,166
<i>Talk to a brother. Joe, you can tell me.</i>

92
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,502
Why do you think I gave you
my real number?

93
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,381
Honestly, Will,
you have some real mental health issues.

94
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,132
Because...

95
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:28,346
I know you can get yourself
in interesting jams.

96
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>But you want to do right.</i>

97
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>- If I can help...</i>
- Why do you wanna help me?

98
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,814
We all just gotta just try
and do the decent thing, moving forward.

99
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,485
You know when you pick up a spider,

100
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,321
<i>and you bring it outside
because you want it to live?</i>

101
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,366
But let's say when it's in your hand,

102
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,953
it dies anyway,
and you don't know if it's your fault.

103
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
But it was in your hand?

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,125
<i>Well, no, it's... I mean,
it's an imperfect metaphor,</i>

105
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,963
but the... the point is,
you... you wanted it... to live.

106
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,132
If I'm hearing you right...

107
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,886
you have someone in your cage...

108
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,471
who is now dead.

109
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,142
But you don't think you killed them.

110
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,436
Will, it wasn't me.

111
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,981
I mean, I don't know that
because I was on a lot of drugs.

112
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,942
But I was going to let her go.

113
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>Just like you.</i>

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,321
I don't think you'd kill someone
you intended to keep alive.

115
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,324
Honestly, Will, I don't know
what happened, and I have to know.

116
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,078
I really feel like I...
I would <i>not</i> have done this.

117
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,204
<i>I believe you.</i>

118
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>But, end of the day...
only you know who you really are.</i>

119
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,214
Whether you really wanted
to let that spider go or not.

120
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,508
Thanks, Will.

121
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,219
<i>Anytime, Will.</i>

122
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,575
I don't think I did this to you.

123
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,244
I'm going to prove I didn't.

124
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,997
<i>Find out who did.</i>

125
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,792
<i>Far be it from Forty to answer a text.</i>

126
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,254
<i>Especially when he's responsible
for my night being a black hole.</i>

127
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,966
<i>I would be sleeping off
the night's debaucheries</i>

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>if I hadn't woken into a nightmare.</i>

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,138
<i>I'll rest
when there's not</i>

130
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>a murderer on the loose.</i>

131
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,641
It's open.

132
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,728
Hey.

133
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,772
Whoa.

134
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,440
I thought <i>I </i>had a rough night.

135
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,817
Love, hey.

136
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,072
- Weren't you writing?
- Yeah, your brother's got a process.

137
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,616
What are you doing here?

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,244
You don't... remember?

139
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,957
Oh, God, was I that drunk?

140
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,365
Did I get this wrong
and I'm just embarrassing myself...

141
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,711
Of course I remember.

142
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,673
The greatest call of my life.

143
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,050
- The greatest?
- Yes.

144
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,182
<i>If we're together, we're okay.</i>

145
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,609
I love you.

146
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,530
I love you... Love.

147
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,076
<i>I can figure this out for us.</i>

148
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,080
Oh, about that. Um...

149
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,666
"I'd go anywhere for you" thing?

150
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,460
I meant that, I did.

151
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,338
But now that I am sober...

152
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,508
could we just slow down that part
a little bit?

153
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,759
Of course.

154
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,969
- Okay.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

155
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>Because time is what I need
to find out who did this to Delilah,</i>

156
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,935
<i>clear my name, protect you,
confirm I'm worthy of you, Love.</i>

157
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,645
Uh...

158
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,935
Does this mean
you're not screwing my sister anymore?

159
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,237
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

160
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,907
Probably just the four tabs of acid
working their way out of his system.

161
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,702
You were on acid last night?

162
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,705
That's your brother's process.

163
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,541
I didn't know he was gonna dose us.
I kept him out of trouble.

164
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,543
Okay, but where is he? Is he okay?

165
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,347
I can't believe
you didn't mention anything.

166
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Forty's fine.

167
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,841
I saw him get in the car
when I left the hotel, like, an hour ago.

168
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
Speaking of missing people...

169
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,932
Anyone see my sister?

170
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,769
- No.
- I haven't seen her.

171
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,480
It's fine.

172
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,774
I just wanted to show her
this death threat she got.

173
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,651
What? Let me see that. What?

174
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,945
This is awful.

175
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,655
Because of the article?

176
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,533
<i>Is that what happened?</i>

177
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>Some Henderson crazy followed me
to the cage?</i>

178
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,207
<i>Slit Delilah's throat
because she showed them who he really was?</i>

179
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,210
- We should show it to the police.
- I will.

180
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,174
Hey, Ellie. Maybe you shouldn't go back
to your apartment

181
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,801
till your sister gets back.

182
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,388
But we can walk to the market.
I can make you some breakfast.

183
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,100
Okay. Um...

184
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,937
Yeah, we'll let Will shower off the night,
and we can get going.

185
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,484
<i>Poor girl has no idea
her life is about to change.</i>

186
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,528
<i>Forever.</i>

187
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,989
Joey.

188
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,784
You don't have to hide.

189
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,246
Remember when we came back,

190
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,955
what I said?

191
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,166
How things would be different?

192
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,294
I meant it.

193
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,224
He's <i>never</i> gonna hurt us again.

194
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,475
Ever.

195
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,603
You hear me?

196
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,459
<i>What the...?</i>

197
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,170
<i>The hell?</i>

198
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
Freeze, asshole!

199
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>- Calvin.
- Crying...</i>

200
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,888
You know what that means.

201
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,806
<i>Rule number three.</i>

202
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,851
- If you cannot stop sobbing, just drink...
<i>- Moon Juice.</i>

203
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,186
You're gonna go to Anavrin.

204
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
<i>I left while I was tripping.</i>

205
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,230
<i>Went to Anavrin.</i>

206
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,775
<i>What says
I didn't make a detour to murder?</i>

207
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,946
<i>Or I went straight to Anavrin and back.</i>

208
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,117
<i>Maybe Calvin can put me there long enough
to account for all the lost time.</i>

209
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,536
- Bettelheim. Right?
<i>- Other Fincher.</i>

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>- Just what I need.</i>
- I'm sorry, what's your nameagain?

211
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,914
Fincher.

212
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,792
Officer Fincher.

213
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,752
That's right. Delilah's friend.

214
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,545
You seen her around lately?

215
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,048
<i>Hm, and operates
with all the nuance of Columbo.</i>

216
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,174
I haven't, actually.

217
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,320
<i>Now, if her phone worked, I could
have her tell him she's chasing a lead</i>

218
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>from Paul Rudd's holistic nutritionist,
but alas, it doesn't.</i>

219
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,139
I hope she's okay.

220
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,351
Why would you say that?

221
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,438
Well... her sister, Ellie,
mentioned she hadn't seen her either.

222
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,524
And, actually...

223
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,944
they got this.

224
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,365
I was gonna bring it by the station.

225
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,412
Apparently, that article she wrote
has got a lot of Hendy fans stirred up.

226
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,581
And I hate to overreact.

227
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,417
Supposedly, some real sickos
have been DMing her.

228
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,087
One even broke into Henderson's place

229
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,007
and tried to stab him a while back...
But I mean, I'm sure you know all this,

230
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,385
after what happened to him.

231
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,554
- Of course.
- So...

232
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,015
Again, I'm probably overreacting...

233
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
but I'm glad
someone's looking out for her.

234
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,896
<i>And at the risk of laying it on...</i>

235
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,815
Oh, and I should tell you...

236
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,527
she broke things off with me.
I think she really likes you, man.

237
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,406
Uh...

238
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,202
If you see her, have her call me.

239
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,287
Will do.

240
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,207
<i>Statistics force me to consider
Officer Douchebag as a suspect.</i>

241
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,669
<i>Too often, it's the jealous boyfriend,
spurned lover.</i>

242
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,343
<i>As much as I'd like to pin it
on him,</i>

243
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,847
<i>all I see is a heartsick puppy dog.</i>

244
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,028
Okay, you gotta remember the part

245
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,947
where you were ranting about
how all the peaches were mad at you.

246
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,798
Calvin, I'm glad you find this so funny.

247
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,536
- I just really need to find...
- I know, find your wallet.

248
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,706
Uh, just, the next time you do acid,

249
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,750
please record it for your future self.

250
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,710
And by that, I mean all of us.

251
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,837
<i>Believe me. I wish I had.</i>

252
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,131
What... What time would you say
that I got here?

253
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,218
11:18. How do I know that?
Because you didn't turn the alarm off.

254
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,014
Made me come down here and jump your ass
like you were some common criminal.

255
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,682
So, I just got a Moon Juice,

256
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,434
and then... when did I leave?

257
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,312
Oh, uh, you were all on me about Cheetos.

258
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,356
Like we carry that ish.

259
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,274
<i>Cheetos? Oh, no.</i>

260
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,525
- Had to be...
- Flamin' Hot?

261
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,903
Ah! So you do remember some fun stuff.

262
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,446
<i>For Delilah.</i>

263
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,199
You kept saying you needed snacks
for the basement.

264
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,825
You kept asking me where the door was.

265
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,703
- I was like, "Sweetie, this is California.
- No basements."

266
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,955
<i>The basement.</i>

267
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,999
<i>I must've thought
that's where the cage was.</i>

268
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>I was headed to see Delilah.</i>

269
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,838
<i>Hold on. None of this stuff was there.</i>

270
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>No Cheetos, nothing. So...</i>

271
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,844
Did I happen to mention
where I was headed when I left?

272
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,432
Yeah. That would suggest a level
of clarity that you did not possess.

273
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,559
Which is why I didn't say anything
last night,

274
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,688
but you need to pay the store back,
even when Forty's with you.

275
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,898
Forty was with me?

276
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,067
You're kidding, right?

277
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,986
<i>I thought he never left the hotel.</i>

278
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,279
You don't remember him
trying to get one of us

279
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,241
to shove a Grey Goose-infused tampon
up his ass?

280
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,576
So he could keep his high
at a "cruising altitude"?

281
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>If Forty was with me,</i>

282
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,293
<i>I would avoid the storage unit
at all costs.</i>

283
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,423
<i>That's why none of the food
for Delilah was there. I never went.</i>

284
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,218
<i>If only my alibi would pick up
his fucking phone.</i>

285
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,513
<i>And by now, Love,
you're wondering where I am.</i>

286
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,073
Hey! Uh-uh. I think one cup's enough
for a 15-year-old.

287
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,575
Okay.

288
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,951
Okay, now.

289
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,038
If you could chop these?

290
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,749
- Okay.
- Here.

291
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,086
You can tuck your fingers underneath.

292
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,356
- It's safer that way and hold the knife...
- Like this?

293
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,257
- All right.
- Now hold your knife like this.

294
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,508
- Up here?
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,908
- Like that?
- Yeah, that's it.

296
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,177
So, how long have you and your sister
been on your own?

297
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:47,941
I guess my amazing life here started
after my dad got sick.

298
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,611
Which is awesome

299
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,073
when he's your only friend in the world,
and you also hate your mom.

300
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,531
Oh.

301
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,035
Okay. Sounds like we have the same mom.

302
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,417
The punchline, obviously,
is that my dad died.

303
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,839
Don't. It's so awkward.
Let's just move on.

304
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,674
Um...

305
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,133
How are these?

306
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,970
I mean...

307
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,516
if the film thing doesn't work out,

308
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,977
you should consider culinary school
in Paris.

309
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,107
Those are really even. That's really good.

310
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,650
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

311
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,947
So your dad left you
with the shitty parent. And then what?

312
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,698
Delilah bolted first.

313
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,369
I endured a couple more years,
and then showed up and ruined her life.

314
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,205
It's fine. Feeling's mutual.

315
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,420
- Something like that?
- Yeah. I can take those.

316
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,131
Thank you.

317
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,069
<i>I pray your brother's home,
just so I can figure this out, Love.</i>

318
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,536
Will. What a pleasant surprise.

319
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,496
- <i>Wish I could say the same.</i>
- Come in.

320
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,042
I was sorry to hear you're leaving LA.

321
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,380
Actually, I'm still working on that.

322
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,631
Nothing's definite yet.

323
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,593
Well, then perhaps
we can persuade you to stay.

324
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,552
Please.

325
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,899
I wanted to thank you.

326
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,570
Forty was all but inconsolable
when I picked him up this morning.

327
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,032
He said you were really there for him
last night.

328
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>I was?</i>

329
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,702
The night's a bit blurry.

330
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,830
You don't have to pretend with me.

331
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,875
I know what he confessed to you.

332
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>Confessed?</i>

333
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,503
I killed her.

334
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,049
<i>Holy shit! How could I forget?</i>

335
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,260
My husband and I appreciate the burden
our son's put on you.

336
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,723
We also want you to know
we're here to ease your burdens.

337
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,350
However great they may be.

338
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,187
Your secrets are safe with us, Will.

339
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>Never has a threat worn
such a luxuriant veil.</i>

340
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,252
<i>And just what is it your parents think
they know about me?</i>

341
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>What the hell did I tell Forty last night?</i>

342
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,740
- Mom!
- I'll let him know you're here.

343
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,661
<i>Add it to the list of mysteries.</i>

344
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,426
<i>No.</i>

345
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,763
<i>- Couldn't be.
- Joe...</i>

346
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,515
Would you fuck me?

347
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,603
Come on. You would totally fuck me.

348
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,148
<i>Forty's my alibi, not my suspect.</i>

349
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>Just because he killed before
doesn't mean he'd...</i>

350
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,112
<i>Well, unless he was crying to your mother
this morning</i>

351
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,197
<i>because he killed again.</i>

352
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,200
<i>Did I tell him I had Delilah in the cage?</i>

353
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,764
<i>That she was the reason
I had to give up on you and leave town?</i>

354
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,913
<i>Would Forty kill to keep us together?</i>

355
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,997
Old sport.

356
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,873
Aw.

357
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,584
Comedown is a bitch.

358
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,963
But that trip. I mean...

359
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,008
We touched God.

360
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,803
Like, "tickled-His-balls" touched.

361
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,055
Inspired work, Broseph.

362
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,265
Forty?

363
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,061
My Gaia. My Isis.

364
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,980
Oh, thank you.

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,984
Soothed my weary soul, as usual.

366
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,068
I love you.

367
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,449
Bye, boys.

368
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,659
Hoo!

369
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,704
What an epic night. Ooh!

370
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,125
<i>Look at him.
He’d have to be a complete sociopath.</i>

371
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,709
<i>Or blacked out.</i>

372
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,878
Oh, are you gonna puke?

373
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,298
'Cause that's totally fine,
just not over here.

374
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,550
It's antique camel hair on demo.

375
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,721
That is for you.

376
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,391
Bro, seriously?

377
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,976
You complete me.

378
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,855
I have to admit, I'm a little foggy. Uh...

379
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,401
I remember we made the run to Anavrin.

380
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,948
Yeah, that place.

381
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,327
Where did we go after Anavrin?

382
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,247
<i>What was that?</i>

383
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,208
You know, um...

384
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,002
- It's kind of a blur.
<i>- He's lying.</i>

385
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,337
<i>Why is he lying?</i>

386
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,672
We stopped somewhere else, right?

387
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,302
Yeah. Again, man, it's such a blur.
I don't really know. Um...

388
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,845
Are you okay?

389
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,351
You know, this is your fault.

390
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,355
All right? You were the one that wanted
to go see Delilah, and...

391
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,818
I would never have done it
if it weren’t for you.

392
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,446
<i>Holy shit. It </i>was <i>him.</i>

393
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,324
I'm like, really, <i>really</i> sorry.

394
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,617
What are you sorry for?

395
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,327
I know that you know what I did.

396
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,540
I was with Candace last night.

397
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,791
Candace?

398
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,045
I know that I screwed up.

399
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:47,759
But if you hadn’t booty-called Delilah,
I never would have called her.

400
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>Booty-call?</i>

401
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,887
<i>Forty has no idea what happened.</i>

402
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,598
I told you that we should go back to work,

403
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,644
but you made Igor drive us
to that random corner downtown.

404
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,566
What is this place, Betteljuice?

405
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,904
Is "Delilah," like,
code for you getting homeless vag?

406
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,657
<i>He didn’t do it.</i>

407
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,577
<i>He dropped me off
and then went to screw Candace.</i>

408
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,953
You told me to go.

409
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,372
<i>Worse, he left me there alone.</i>

410
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,250
So youleave me on a corner?

411
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,086
- Completely out of my mind?
- Yeah.

412
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,713
Look, I fucked up, all right?

413
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,048
And I fucked her, and I fucked us.

414
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,759
I told you we were only sexting
now and again...

415
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,889
<i>Motive, I had.
He gave me means. Opportunity.</i>

416
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,765
I was lonely, okay? And, like...

417
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,228
redheads, you know?
I just figured what’s the harm in...

418
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,480
"What’s the harm"?

419
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,149
I had to leave everything behind
because of her.

420
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:48,570
- She is the reason I lost everything.
- But you found Love.

421
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,906
How could you leave me for her?

422
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,159
I’m really, really so sorry.

423
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,328
Please forgive me. Joe, come on. Please?

424
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,872
<i>I can forgive your brother
for seeing Candace.</i>

425
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>What I can’t forgive
is him leaving me there</i>

426
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,168
<i>with a head full of acid.</i>

427
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,251
Look...

428
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,630
Oh, God.

429
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,635
Okay, I'm gonna be right back. Okay?

430
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,928
I'm just gonna be right back!

431
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,890
<i>Unless this was Candace.</i>

432
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,935
<i>Some elaborate plot to set me up.</i>

433
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,312
<i>But why kill Delilah?</i>

434
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,439
<i>Why not just kill me?</i>

435
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,984
<i>She had her chance.
Still, this doesn’t mean it was me.</i>

436
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,820
<i>Forty can put me there.
What’s to say I went in?</i>

437
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,364
<i>Hold up.</i>

438
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,491
Hey, wait.

439
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,910
Take this.

440
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,540
Give it to Delilah.

441
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,083
And when you fuck her,

442
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,376
you think of me.

443
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,586
Okay?

444
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,798
So don't ghost me.

445
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,298
All right?

446
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,927
Or do.

447
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,177
Get it?

448
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,347
<i>Oh, man.</i>

449
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,058
<i>But why can’t I remember it?</i>

450
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,730
<i>Am I just clenching my eyes shut
against some truth I don’t want to face?</i>

451
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,279
Hey, you.

452
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
<i>You need to get over here now.</i>

453
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,824
<i>Ellie's freaking out.</i>

454
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,540
Hey, hey. Um...

455
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,542
Everything was fine, and then...

456
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,462
She's convinced something happened
to her sister.

457
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,725
Stay the hell away from me.

458
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,437
Ellie.

459
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,731
I said stay the hell away from me!

460
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,691
Don't! Let go! No!

461
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,775
- Stop!
- It's okay.

462
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,820
Stop. Let go. Let go of me. Stop.

463
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,238
Let go.

464
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,991
It's just me.

465
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,911
It's gonna be okay.

466
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,081
It’s not gonna be okay!

467
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,709
It’s always gonna be a mess!

468
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,462
- What? What’s gonna be a mess?
- My life.

469
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,965
My whole fucking life!

470
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,801
Why won't she respond to my texts?

471
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,304
I’m sure she has a good reason.

472
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,848
She’s never left me alone
this long before.

473
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,600
I know something happened to her.

474
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,518
You don’t know that.

475
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,187
She was pulling away from me.

476
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,023
I could tell.

477
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,777
Everybody wants to get away from me!

478
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,906
Why?

479
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,826
What’s wrong with me?

480
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,286
Ellie.

481
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,041
There's nothing’s wrong with you.

482
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,709
Nothing.

483
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,961
It’s not you.

484
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,512
<i>It's me.</i>

485
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,640
Don't ever think that.

486
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>I know what you see, Love.
A good man.</i>

487
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,909
<i>But I have my doubts.</i>

488
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,967
You are a genius, Forty Quinn.

489
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,852
If I was your agent,
I would be sucking your dick right now.

490
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,187
That's quite an endorsement.

491
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,606
Well, somebody woke up
on the wrong side of an acid trip.

492
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,192
Okay. Um, look...

493
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,571
- Last night was a mistake. Okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,406
The good kind, right?

495
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,489
No.

496
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,492
- I was high.
- Yeah.

497
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,787
I hate when I slide
into a girl’s vagina without meaning to.

498
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,291
Stop. No. I’m serious.

499
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,461
If Joe hadn’t booty-called Delilah,
I would never...

500
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,670
Wait, what?

501
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,757
The manager from his place?

502
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,507
That Delilah?

503
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,302
See? He’s right.

504
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,095
You are all about him.

505
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,806
- And you were just using me...
- Wait, Joe said that?

506
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,810
- Did he tell you what to say to me?
- God. Just stop.

507
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,855
You are obsessed with him.

508
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,357
I mean, why else would you still be here

509
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,693
after my sister paid you to go?

510
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,279
I am trying to protect you...

511
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,741
and your sister
from a guy who buried me alive.

512
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,535
So you say.
You also said your name was "Amy Adam,"

513
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,955
which, come to think of it,
sounds really stupid.

514
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,833
What, was "Britney Spear" already taken?

515
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,298
If you had a brain,

516
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,049
you could read
between the lines of your own script

517
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,678
and see that you cracked the case.

518
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:11,476
Hector, the hot sculptor boyfriend
who got jealous and killed Beck

519
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,269
and framed Dr. Nicky?

520
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,772
It’s Joe.

521
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:21,694
Okay, so now if Dr. Nicky is so innocent,

522
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,863
why don't you take your theory to him?

523
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,948
I tried.

524
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,575
He wouldn’t talk to me. No one will.

525
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,912
You know, it’s a little hard
when everyone sees you as the crazy ex.

526
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,330
Maybe ask yourself why that is.

527
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,581
Oh, God.

528
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,791
God!

529
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:40,255
What is it about Joe fucking Goldberg?

530
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,716
Why is it that no one can see him
for what he is?

531
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,553
Careful. You're talking about my family.

532
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,138
Huh.

533
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,144
Don’t come crying to me
when he kills your sister.

534
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,173
<i>One of those days,</i>

535
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,635
<i>it seemed the sun
was in a rush to come down.</i>

536
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,597
<i>Good thing.
With it comes the cover I need.</i>

537
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,558
<i>No closer to knowing who killed Delilah.</i>

538
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,519
<i>But I got to get her body off my hands.</i>

539
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,563
<i>Only question is how.</i>

540
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,234
<i>Not getting caught, that I can manage.
I've been here before.</i>

541
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,321
<i>It’s Ellie. What is best for her?</i>

542
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,531
<i>That is what I promised her.</i>

543
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,741
<i>Promised them both.</i>

544
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,410
<i>Is it better to know Delilah’s dead...</i>

545
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,329
<i>...or always wonder?</i>

546
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,998
<i>Which version of this is worse?</i>

547
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,461
<i>Get Delilah’s phone fixed, man.</i>

548
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,671
<i>Give Ellie a sister a little longer.</i>

549
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,133
<i>She hears what she needs to
before losing Delilah forever,</i>

550
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>and the rest would be on us.</i>

551
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,304
<i>If there can be an us.</i>

552
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,933
<i>If I’m not the monster
who took Ellie’s sister,</i>

553
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,768
<i>we could take care of Ellie.</i>

554
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,061
<i>Be a family.</i>

555
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,814
<i>That’s the best ending of all.
The one where love makes everything okay.</i>

556
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,487
Delilah.

557
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,782
It’s Amy.

558
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,910
Will’s ex.

559
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,832
Look, if you’re in there, open up,
all right?

560
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,544
Fuck.

561
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,576
<i>Amy Candace.</i>

562
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,246
<i>I was just thinking.</i>

563
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,417
<i>We never got to live out
our spectrophilia fantasy.</i>

564
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,171
<i>Ours is a forbidden love,
but if I’m a ghost, right?</i>

565
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,966
<i>I mean, I’ll be in and out,
and you won’t even know it.</i>

566
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,677
<i>I mean, you’ll definitely know it, but...</i>

567
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,304
<i>Wait. Hold up! Hold up.</i>

568
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,891
<i>Take this. Give it to Delilah.</i>

569
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,937
<i>And when you fuck her, think of me.</i>

570
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,441
<i>Promise? Anyway, so don't gho...</i>

571
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,575
Delilah.

572
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,500
I’m so sorry.

573
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,298
I don’t know what happened to you,
and I want to know.

574
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,218
I told you you would walk out of here.

575
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,181
And I failed you.

576
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,308
But Ellie will be okay.

577
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,102
She will know you love her.

578
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,729
And no matter what...

579
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,983
I will never let her get hurt.

580
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:36,032
- Back the fuck up!
- Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

581
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,701
Ah! Oh!

582
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,871
I told you, Joe.
It was just a matter of time.

583
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,956
This isn't what it looks like.
I didn’t do this.

584
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,291
Oh, bunny.

585
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,793
Your phone.

586
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,669
- Now!
- Oh, shit!

587
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,255
- Give me your phone, Joe.
- Okay, okay.

588
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,840
- All right.
- Unlock it.

589
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,468
- I can't fucking see.
- Now!

590
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,551
Hang on.

591
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,307
The police are never gonna believe you.

592
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,393
You’re locked in a cage
with a dead body, Joe.

593
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,687
I think they might believe me this time.

594
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,358
What are you doing?

595
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,401
What are you gonna do?

596
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,113
Thought Love might like to come
and see what you’ve done.

597
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,989
No, please! Candace...

598
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,825
Candace, don’t do that.

599
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,119
- Leave her out of this.
- You wish.

600
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,707
Sucks to have someone pretend to be you,
doesn’t it, Joe?

601
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,059
<i>If I killed this woman,</i>

602
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,187
<i>then I deserve this.</i>

603
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:54,360
<i>I thought I only ever acted
from a place of love.</i>

604
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
<i>To protect.</i>

605
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,034
- No!
- Stop!

606
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,454
<i>But what type of man would do this?</i>

607
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,666
<i>I'm gonna show you
who you really are.</i>

608
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,752
<i>Has Candace been right all along?</i>

609
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,839
<i>Have I been fooling myself?</i>

610
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,720
<i>Have I just been refusing to face
who I really am?</i>

611
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,763
<i>- Fucking lying!
- No!</i>

612
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,433
Stop! You’re hurting me!

613
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,102
- Get off of me!
- Fucking lying!

614
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,788
- Stop!
- Tell me his fucking name!

615
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,107
Get away from me!
Let go of me! You're crazy!

616
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,911
<i>What am I?</i>

617
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,380
What did you do?

618
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,466
What did you do?

619
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,760
You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.

620
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,803
<i>You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.</i>

621
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,722
<i>You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.</i>

622
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,015
<i>What did you do?</i>

623
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,816
- Love.
- What's going on?

624
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,533
What did you do?

625
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,203
Told you what he did to me,

626
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,664
Beck, and God knows who else.

627
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,170
You couldn’t believe me, so I proved it.

628
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,090
Let him out of there.

629
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,217
No.

630
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:47,181
This asshole is going to be in a cage
for the rest of his life.

631
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,188
Call the cops.

632
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,150
I just wanted you to see it first.

633
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,944
You're crazy.

634
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,614
Tell her.

635
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,577
Tell her you didn’t do this!

636
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,249
I did.

637
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,419
She’s right.

638
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,839
Everything she said about what I did...

639
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,841
is true.

640
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,470
I’m sorry.

641
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,308
You’re not crazy.

642
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,354
I tried to kill her.

643
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,733
I blamed it all on her.

644
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,360
But that was a lie,

645
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,571
like so many others.

646
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,036
I thought I was doing it
for the best reasons,

647
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,495
for love.

648
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,955
But, Love...

649
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,789
it wasn't.

650
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,501
It was never really love.

651
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,340
I never knew love until I met you.

652
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,760
I would do anything for you.

653
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:11,640
I just want to be good enough for you.

654
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:17,897
I told myself that I could be different,
I could do it another way.

655
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,315
But if that was true...

656
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,987
Delilah wouldn't be...

657
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,198
dead.

658
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,496
I couldn't face the truth
because I didn’t want to lose you.

659
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,664
I did this.

660
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,959
She figured out I'd killed Henderson,

661
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,712
and I killed her.

662
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,066
<i>Is this how I was always
destined to end?</i>

663
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,238
<i>Alone, unloved,
waiting for the police to arrive?</i>

664
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,949
<i>Could things have gone any differently?</i>

665
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,661
<i>If I’d walked
into a different bookstore...</i>

666
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,164
- Who am I to you?
- You're an asshole.

667
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,876
<i>One not run by a Soviet
prison guard.</i>

668
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,797
<i>Or maybe...
if I’d had different parents...</i>

669
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,638
Mom? Mommy?

670
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,684
You were protecting me.

671
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
It had to be done.

672
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,316
You’re a good boy, Joey.

673
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,362
Everything’s gonna be okay.

674
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,667
Listen carefully to every word I say.

675
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,545
You would never hurt anyone.

676
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,922
And that's the truth.

677
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,756
Never.

678
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,551
Much less kill someone.

679
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,178
No...

680
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,473
You're a good boy.

681
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,558
It was just an accident.

682
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,021
A terrible... accident.

683
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,524
Yeah. Yeah, okay?

684
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,657
<i>I’m done with excuses.</i>

685
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:40,331
<i>I'm done blaming everyone else
for the things I’ve done.</i>

686
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,961
<i>I once told Beck,</i>

687
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,590
<i>I learned a lesson
when Mooney locked me in.</i>

688
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,260
<i>Hide a spare key.</i>

689
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,606
Love! Hey!

690
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,900
God, leave me alone!

691
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,279
<i>So you can get out
of the goddamn cage.</i>

692
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,950
Love.

693
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,621
<i>But it’s time I take responsibility.</i>

694
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,083
Love.

695
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,835
<i>Accept the punishment for my crime.</i>

696
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,776
<i>That a cage is where I belong.</i>

697
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,356
Where’s Candace?

698
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,110
What happened?

699
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,529
I took care of it.

700
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,969
