1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,561
I take care of him
every single day.

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,564
All day long. And you're gonna bawl me out
for one night with my friends?

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,565
You think I'm stupid?

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,651
- You think I'm gonna believe this shit?
- No. I think you're paranoid.

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,319
You need help.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,030
I'm not done talking to you.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,341
- Don't touch me!
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,635
- Let go of me. You're hurting me.
- You think I'm a fool?

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,869
Is that what you think of me?

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,163
- Why can't you just do right...
- No, please!

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,081
...and love me
like you're supposed to, huh?

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>It's been said
that dreams are illustrations</i>

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>from the book
your soul is writing about you.</i>

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>So why do I keep dreaming
about my childhood?</i>

15
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,348
<i>Dr. Nicky would have said
I have unprocessed feelings</i>

16
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>about how my parents
didn't take very good care of me.</i>

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>But now you do.</i>

18
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>In so many ways.</i>

19
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,486
Hey, you.

20
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,822
<i>You make me kinder,</i>

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,449
<i>more selfless.</i>

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,118
<i>You make me feel good.</i>

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,707
<i>So good, I forget whatever darkness
resurfaced in my sleep.</i>

24
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,418
<i>I lose myself in you,</i>

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>find myself through you,</i>

26
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,297
<i>and when I'm with you,</i>

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,134
<i>we're the only two people on Earth.</i>

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,475
It's Forty.

29
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,269
Can that wait?

30
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,480
No, I ignored him three times last night.

31
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,273
Okay. Hey.

32
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,776
Lovey, where you been?

33
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>Uh, Phone died. What's up?</i>

34
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,488
Ted Hope is what's up.

35
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>Ran into him at NeueHouse.</i>

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,119
<i>Told him I am this close
to attaching Hendy to my new project,</i>

37
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,579
and he wants to see the full pitch.

38
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,915
Can you even process that?

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,374
That's great.

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,335
That's really great.

41
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,047
Now all I need to do is mind meld
with our idea machine, Will.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,341
You haven't heard from him, have you?

43
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
He... um... hmm.

44
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
Yeah, you know,
I haven't heard much from him.

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,764
<i>The guy must really not be feeling well.</i>

46
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,142
Yeah, poor guy. Oh.

47
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,684
One other thing.

48
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,312
My inner Sasquatch is coming out,

49
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,691
so I'm gonna need you
to, uh, cut my hair before this meeting.

50
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,109
Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon?

51
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,736
Yeah. Uh, why do you sound
so out of breath?

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm on the elliptical, you know. Gotta go.

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,911
<i>Old me would be annoyed
by such an intrusion.</i>

54
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,663
<i>But new me</i>

55
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>wasn't even fazed by it.</i>

56
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,127
- <i>And you know why that is.</i>
- Oh, right there!

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>Because I finally feel</i>

58
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,965
<i>like I'm becoming a better man.</i>

59
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,551
That's so fucking good!

60
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>And it's all because of you.</i>

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,738
Didn't peg you for an outer space guy.

62
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,574
Oh, it came with the apartment.

63
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,910
Along with the pink, fuzzy pillows.

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,622
Hey, you can see my house from here.

65
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,809
All the better to spy on you.

66
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,544
<i>Not that I've needed to
since I trust you completely.</i>

67
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,137
Let me guess.

68
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,512
Forty?

69
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,390
When you text him back just...

70
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,184
don't tell him about us.

71
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,562
<i>But if your brother knew about us,
maybe he'd give us some space.</i>

72
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,272
Remind me again...

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,025
why "us" is a secret.

74
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,070
Whenever I start dating someone,

75
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,365
Forty tends to feel threatened.

76
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,533
You know, he doesn't have
many people to count on

77
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,952
so he needs me.

78
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,247
And his sobriety is always
the most fragile in the first...

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,457
you know, right after he's slipped.

80
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,834
Let's just give him a week or two

81
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,503
before we, you know,

82
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,506
shove our euphoria in his face.

83
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,384
<i>Even your empathy is a turn-on.</i>

84
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,970
If you're euphoric now, just wait,

85
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,972
just wait until Santa Barbara
this weekend.

86
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,098
I know.

87
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>And there goes Santa Barbara.</i>

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,941
What if...

89
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,238
we take a rain check

90
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,823
on Santa Barbara?

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,369
The more time you spend with him now,
the cooler he'll be when we do tell him.

92
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,748
<i>Anything for you, Love.</i>

93
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,505
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

94
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,588
Okay.

95
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,844
Well, I guess that means
we'll have to make up for that

96
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,971
lost Santa Barbara sex some other way.

97
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,902
<i>So, this is what it feels like
to be nourished and at peace.</i>

98
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,196
Um what do you think you're doing?

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,698
Working on a project?

100
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,991
What project?

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,118
I told you, I don't want...

102
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,037
I'm not hanging out
with Henderson anymore.

103
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,707
Why? What'd he do?

104
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,126
He just drinks too much.
It's embarrassing.

105
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>This explains why she hasn't
been texting Henderson all week.</i>

106
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,423
<i>Huge relief.</i>

107
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,258
Goetz's dad's girlfriend needs a PA

108
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,022
for a short that starts shooting
next week.

109
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,013
Painfully derivative,
but a credit's a credit.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,681
Till then,

111
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,184
I'm expressing myself through collage.

112
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,187
<i>I never thought I'd say this,
but I feel for Delilah.</i>

113
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,148
<i>She's only trying to protect her sister
from the same sleazeball</i>

114
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,608
<i>she fell victim to.</i>

115
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,277
Just... do not ruin my walls.

116
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,825
Yeah, she so wants to be at power top.

117
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,029
- Tell me about it.
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,388
Can you believe she put
that spy software on my phone?

119
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,412
<i>Shit.</i>

120
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,957
- You sure it was her?
- Who else would it be?

121
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,627
So you're not gonna tell her you know?

122
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,629
Obviously not.

123
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,758
It's way more useful
if she thinks it's still working.

124
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,261
<i>This is what I get
for trying to out-tech a teenager.</i>

125
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,014
<i>It's a good thing I have another way
to keep tabs.</i>

126
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>Henderson's jacktop.</i>

127
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,651
<i>Even if he's realized
it's gone missing by now,</i>

128
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,486
<i>I've disabled Find My Friends,</i>

129
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>and he hasn't been diligent enough
to un-sync his IMs.</i>

130
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,582
<i>Ellie hasn't fallen in line,</i>

131
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,875
<i>she's gotten craftier.</i>

132
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,254
<i>I could tell Delilah, but then
I'd have to explain how I know.</i>

133
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,599
<i>Or I could take care of it.</i>

134
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,977
<i>The brave, good, right thing to do,</i>

135
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,937
<i>the kind of man you'd want me to be.</i>

136
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,402
<i>People have secret rooms
to hide something shameful</i>

137
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,028
<i>and doubtless, illegal.</i>

138
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,655
<i>If I find what Hendy's hiding,</i>

139
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>I can get him arrested and Ellie safe.</i>

140
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,033
<i>I'll make you proud.</i>

141
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,831
<i>With Hendy out of town,
perfect time to get back inside his house.</i>

142
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,309
<i>But first, there's someone else
I have to take care of.</i>

143
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,443
Eat it up.

144
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,156
I paid a lot
for those macrobiotic sea vegetables.

145
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,047
Okay.

146
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,131
Okay what?

147
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,425
Okay, let's have the conversation.

148
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,135
If I let you out...

149
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,095
then what?

150
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,389
Is this a joke?

151
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,602
<i>No, the only joke is me pretending
that keeping a man in a cage</i>

152
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
<i>is helping me be my best self.</i>

153
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,395
No.

154
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,940
What's your plan?

155
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,067
My plan is...

156
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,611
to forget any of this happened...

157
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,490
and to live happily ever after
with Gigi in Manila.

158
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>Gigi, Will's internet fiancée,</i>

159
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,121
<i>a.k.a. least promising plan of all time.</i>

160
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,250
If you bring me the <i>Beast Wars</i> box
in my coat closet,

161
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,169
I can make a fake passport,

162
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,380
and you will never hear from me again.

163
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,464
I have an idea.

164
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,342
You like games.

165
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,720
Love 'em, in other contexts, dude.

166
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,804
Right.

167
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,974
I will let you out...

168
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,433
if you prove

169
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,269
you'll never turn me in.

170
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,146
Prove my loyalty?

171
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,776
And how am I supposed to do that
from inside a cage?

172
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,363
I don't know. You're smart.
I believe in you.

173
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,491
Don't give up.

174
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,328
You need something
to get your brain juices flowing.

175
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,372
You need a project.

176
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,627
What do you need this time?

177
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,965
I need Henderson's home security disabled.

178
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,217
He's hiding something.

179
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,594
Sounds familiar.

180
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,849
You're gonna need a jammer.

181
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,018
Question is which kind,

182
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,228
so I'll need to know what system he's got.

183
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,648
Oh, am I allowed to touch a laptop

184
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,108
to help you...

185
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,611
help me help you do this thing?

186
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,327
Stop. That one.

187
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,203
Is that a sign by the hedge?

188
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,583
People put those signs around their house
to make them feel safe

189
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,918
because they are, respectfully,

190
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,713
idiots of the highest magnitude.

191
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,455
<i>'Cause it only makes it easier
for people like me</i>

192
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,718
<i>to find out which frequency
they're broadcasting on.</i>

193
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,470
<i>Once you jam the frequency,</i>

194
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,096
<i>all the sensors are disabled.</i>

195
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,534
<i>Good ol' Hendy has obviously
never seen </i>The Bling Ring.

196
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,042
<i>Okay, Hendy, where's the toy room?</i>

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,047
<i>What is this? Like a Narnia situation?</i>

198
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,383
<i>Oh, Mr. Tumnus.</i>

199
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,368
<i>Huh.</i>

200
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,830
<i>Wouldn't have pegged him
for a Dickens guy.</i>

201
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,627
<i>Oh, how very supervillain-y.</i>

202
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,516
<i>It's like Hendy's id
ate too much candy and porn</i>

203
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,809
<i>and threw it all up.</i>

204
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,078
<i>'Cause nothing's worse
than a sex dungeon with dust bunnies.</i>

205
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>Could he be more obvious?</i>

206
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,535
<i>Delilah was right.</i>

207
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>He's a bad man
who deserves to be punished.</i>

208
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,543
<i>It's only fitting
that she break the story wide open.</i>

209
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,396
<i>Come on.</i>

210
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,943
<i>You can do this.</i>

211
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,905
<i>Attagirl, get to work.</i>

212
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,082
<i>With Hendy being capably dealt with,</i>

213
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,709
<i>I can go back to my Love bubble with you.</i>

214
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,711
No, you don't understand.

215
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,131
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, please.

216
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,342
- [That is crazy.
- {Love] Hey!

217
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,136
- Look who I ran into.
- Hi.

218
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,520
<i>Old me might have been annoyed
by this coincidence,</i>

219
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>but your friends are refreshingly chill
and easy to talk to.</i>

220
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,026
I read in our <i>Kundalini Cookbook</i>
that golden milk is a life-changer.

221
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,445
Into Kundalini, okay.

222
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,531
<i>Actually, I'm not, but Gabe is.</i>

223
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,616
<i>Constantly retweets his guru.</i>

224
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,326
I mean, I'm just curious, I'm a novice.

225
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,953
Oh, I can help you out with that.

226
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,790
- Will it help my stress-induced gastritis?
- What?

227
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,877
Oh, Emma showed up to set the other day
with her head and eyebrows shaved,

228
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,754
so I spent the last 72 hours
emotionally blowing the director

229
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,398
just trying to get her, like, un-fired.

230
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,508
- What've you done about the tummy stuff?
- Ashita..

231
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,969
- Good.
- But she says it's a pitta imbalance,

232
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,887
Of course.

233
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,097
Yeah, but she refuses to do blood cleanse.

234
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,367
Because it tastes like fresh anus.

235
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,951
<i>Did she just say "blood cleanse"?</i>

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,416
Tell me you're doing reiki. Come on.

237
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,979
Or, you know, cupping will help.

238
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,273
This is great, but it's not
gonna work because, hello,

239
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,482
it's past life trauma.

240
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,566
Always.

241
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,994
<i>Shit, that wasn't a joke. Say
something. Say something, anything.</i>

242
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,684
Have you tried going to the doctor?

243
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,913
Like, a Western medicine doctor?

244
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,332
I'm kidding.

245
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,541
I'm obviously kidding.

246
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,794
That's funny.

247
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,796
I mean, everyone
has their own lens, right?

248
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,088
Of course.

249
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,257
<i>You're disappointed.</i>

250
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>I flunked, I embarrassed you.
How do I fix this?</i>

251
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,262
Okay, can we just tell 'em?

252
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,804
Okay.

253
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,183
We didn't accidentally run into you guys.

254
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,101
- We planned it!
- Yeah!

255
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,188
- Surprise!
- Really?

256
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,565
- Yeah.
- Well...

257
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,151
<i>If I didn't know you better,
I'd call that a sneaky,</i>

258
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,570
<i>insecure Beck kind of move.</i>

259
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,905
<i>Do I know you better?</i>

260
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,406
Okay, so...

261
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,617
I just thought...

262
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,747
that if I was going to meet
your insanely tight inner circle,

263
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,917
you know, I would get in my head

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,420
and, like, research everyone, and...

265
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
I just wanted you
to be able to be relaxed.

266
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,884
<i>You did this for me.</i>

267
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,719
Okay.

268
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,974
Then can someone please tell me
what the hell a pitta imbalance is?

269
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,142
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, honey.

270
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,812
I thought you would never ask. Um,

271
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,188
it's usually stress-induced...

272
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,481
I love him.

273
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,024
<i>And just like that,</i>

274
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,068
<i>I'm part of the tribe.</i>

275
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,322
<i>No longer on the outside looking in,
thanks to you.</i>

276
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,702
Did you invite him?

277
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,202
No.

278
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,709
Hey, Forty, I thought it was your day off.

279
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,585
Just coming in for my green juice.

280
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,796
- Well, join us. Grab a bun.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,133
Wait, Love, weren't you checking out
agave wholesalers today?

282
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,261
Yeah, I was going to
and then we all ran into each other.

283
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,887
Mm-hmm.

284
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,765
Why don't you just sit down?

285
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,849
Why?

286
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,727
So you can lie to my face right now?

287
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,272
Yeah, I've been knowing
that you two were hooking up.

288
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,443
And I was just waiting
for you to come clean.

289
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,779
And you don't even have the decency

290
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,198
to invite me to your coming-out brunch.

291
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,992
We can talk when I cut your hair...

292
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,202
No, you're not touching my hair!

293
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,415
Forty, this is not the time or place.
You need to stop it now.

294
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,257
Hey, hey. Just let him go.

295
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,815
<i>What Forty needs are boundaries.</i>

296
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,108
Oh!

297
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,614
It isn't him.

298
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,576
He's punishing me.

299
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,494
God.

300
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,122
I hope he's not drinking.

301
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,168
I should... I should text his sponsor.

302
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,046
<i>Honestly, you could both
use some boundaries.</i>

303
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,341
<i>But I don't blame you.
Every one of us has a blind spot.</i>

304
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,592
No.

305
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,926
I shouldn't.

306
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,596
This is crazy.

307
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,182
I am... crazy!

308
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,851
You're not crazy.

309
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,522
You are <i>trying</i> to be a good sister.

310
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,692
<i>Here is where old me would suggest
you need to distance yourself,</i>

311
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,946
<i>even if that meant pushing Forty
further toward the edge.</i>

312
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,573
Then why do I feel so shitty?

313
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,037
<i>But new me, the me I'm becoming
because of you,</i>

314
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>is going to make this better for you, me,
and Forty.</i>

315
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,208
Forty wants to be...

316
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,291
Can you just...?

317
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,838
Forty wants to be included.

318
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
All right? So let's include him.

319
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,843
Standing Sunday brunch thing.

320
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,595
Beach day once a month.

321
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,389
Once.

322
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,894
Yeah, I think he would really like that.

323
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,148
Starting now,
I'm gonna be a better friend.

324
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,901
I'm gonna help him come up
with a killer pitch.

325
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>Busier he is with a viable project,
the less dependent he'll be on you.</i>

326
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,991
I cannot ask you to do that.

327
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,244
You didn't. It would be my honor.

328
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
Aw, man.

329
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,638
That...

330
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,848
That was heaven.

331
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,517
That was medicine.

332
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,561
They should bottle you, Delilah.

333
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,438
They should.

334
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,028
You okay?

335
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,237
What? Yeah, yeah.

336
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,697
You sure? You seem...

337
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,199
kinda distant.

338
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,702
I'm sorry,
are we <i>that</i> kind of fuck buddy now?

339
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,163
You know, we can talk about real stuff...

340
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,625
without violating
the fuck buddy code of ethics.

341
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,918
It's... It's been done.

342
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,546
Okay. Um...

343
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,883
I am... dealing with a thing.

344
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,053
And I could actually use
some professional advice.

345
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,430
Like from... Yeah, of course.

346
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,433
But like so fucking off the record,
it's not even funny.

347
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,603
Okay, OTR, I got it.

348
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,686
Okay.

349
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,357
Someone anonymously...

350
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,443
sent me some photos that I know for a fact

351
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,113
were taken by a certain
high-profile celebrity.

352
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,493
And some of the girls in the photos,

353
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,328
maybe all...

354
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,163
are underage.

355
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,750
That prick you've been trying to nail,
Henderson.

356
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,128
Maybe one of your sources
is trying to give you some more ammo.

357
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Maybe.

358
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,174
I want to write the exposé. I want to...

359
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,636
nail his one remaining ball
to the ceiling, but...

360
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,638
the more that I think about it...

361
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm one of the girls.

362
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,561
Oh, no, man, Delilah...

363
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,273
And if I break the story,
and it comes out later

364
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,876
that the same thing happened to me,
then I lose all credibility.

365
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,528
The whole story just gets picked apart.

366
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,488
I could take the photos into Sex Crimes.

367
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,907
I'll say that I got them anonymously.

368
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,619
Yeah, so some star-fucker cops
can get paid off to bury them? Yeah.

369
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,913
I know the right people
to talk to, Delilah.

370
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,623
Don't you trust me?

371
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,669
Okay.

372
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,647
Come on, people must have told you
you look like a model.

373
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,525
- We should get a drink sometime.
- You're single?

374
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,319
It's complicated.

375
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,156
I'm going out of town tomorrow,
but I could take you out tonight.

376
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,908
Tonight doesn't work,
but how about now?

377
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,953
Seems like you've got
your hands full already.

378
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, he's a big boy.

379
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,146
I'm gonna need you to stay here for a bit.

380
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,178
Read your book. I'll be back.

381
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,881
- Don't go too short like last time, okay?
- I'm not.

382
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,692
You asked me to do this.

383
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
Top of the morning, will.i.am.

384
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,073
I hope we didn't wake you.

385
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
I hope we did.

386
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,703
So I can apologize
for losing my shit yesterday.

387
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, it's already forgotten.

388
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,710
You are one magnanimous motherfucker.

389
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,295
And we...

390
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,672
are going to make a great team.

391
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,926
Right. I told Forty that you said
you would help him with his project.

392
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,012
<i>- Only so I can have more of you.</i>
- Absolutely.

393
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,347
Schweet.

394
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,059
I had to push the Ted Hope meeting
because I was irate after...

395
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,270
Well, we don't need to talk
about the brunch anymore.

396
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,273
Uh, but It's fine. I'll pitch him
when he gets back from South By.

397
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,608
Sounds like a plan.

398
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,571
But you and I should get started
this afternoon.

399
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,487
- Okay.
- Also, Lovey said something

400
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,697
about all of us going
to the beach later today?

401
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,781
Oh, right.

402
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,326
<i>Sooner than I'd care to, but...</i>

403
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,285
Great.

404
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,829
But I need Love...

405
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,706
to go with me
to buy a new suit for the pitch.

406
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,458
Sure, let's go shopping.

407
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,378
No, like, just me and Love.

408
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,173
I get self-conscious
when I go suit shopping because of...

409
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,342
my thighs.

410
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,512
Forty, Will and I have plans.

411
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,723
It's fine. Will doesn't mind.

412
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,934
Do you, old sport?

413
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,521
<i>Your brother is a monster.</i>

414
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,604
Not at all.

415
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,232
Happy shopping.

416
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,738
<i>Becoming a better person
is way more aggravating than I thought,</i>

417
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,241
<i>but I'm still going to find a way
to help your brother.</i>

418
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,951
How's book one?

419
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,538
Margarita just rescued the rape victim
from eternal damnation.

420
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,499
So, uh, you know... light beach reading.

421
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,007
That's the book guy?

422
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,800
He doesn't play for your team.

423
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,012
No fair. You already have Hendy
so why do you get all the hot zaddies?

424
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,930
Okay, first,

425
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,974
Will is like a eunuch to me.

426
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,434
And Hendy?

427
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,603
He is not my zaddy either.

428
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,896
Which reminds me,

429
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,856
I'm going to his screening tonight.

430
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,859
Text me and invite me to sleep over
so D thinks I'm at your place.

431
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,985
Thank you.

432
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,324
<i>Why hasn't Delilah
gotten Henderson arrested yet?</i>

433
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,047
<i>Flaming Hot Cheetos.</i>

434
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,341
<i>Stress food, very bad sign.</i>

435
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,927
Management should really get that fixed.

436
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,513
What do you need, Apartment Three?

437
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,350
Just wanted to make sure
you got that envelope on your doorstep.

438
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,520
How did you know about that?

439
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,939
I saw a girl drop it off.

440
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
What'd she look like?

441
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,693
I saw her from behind.
She had a... hoodie.

442
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,777
Why?

443
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,404
Nothing.

444
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,115
Doesn't seem like nothing.

445
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,243
Hey, is someone harassing you?

446
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,326
No.

447
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,248
Delilah, I've seen the look on your face.
If someone is bothering you, just...

448
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

449
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,630
If someone is bothering you,
go to the cops.

450
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,073
- I'll go with you.
- Would you relax? Nobody's stalking me.

451
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,428
This is about Henderson.

452
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,808
The woman you saw dropped
his kiddie porn photos on my doorstep.

453
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,102
Well, this is great, right?

454
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,604
I showed 'em to a cop,
and he said they're useless

455
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,166
and he can't do shit with them
because Henderson's not in them.

456
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,234
And the backdrop's completely nondescript.

457
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,902
Bastard's smart.

458
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,406
- <i>Shit. Shit, shit, shit!</i>
- So what are you gonna do?

459
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,129
Stick 'em in a drawer until somebody else
blows the whistle on him.

460
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,829
If the police had found them on Henderson
or in Henderson's house,

461
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,623
then they could've made a case,
but as it is...

462
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,835
whoever swiped them
bungled the shit out of this.

463
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,135
<i>Double fuck!</i>

464
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,488
<i>Promised to help your brother,
but now I have to make sure</i>

465
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,181
<i>Ellie doesn't
walk into the jaws of perversion.</i>

466
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,183
<i>I'll have to keep it short with Forty.</i>

467
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,351
Sit down.

468
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,811
In the end,

469
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,524
our guy has to murder all three women.

470
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,736
It's like... the ultimate irony.

471
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,779
So what do you think?

472
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,912
<i>That it sounds like the most
anti-feminist horror film in history,</i>

473
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,244
<i>- which is saying a lot.</i>
- I think it's really good.

474
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,121
You don't think it gets wonky
in the middle?

475
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,831
- No.
- You don't think we need to, like,

476
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,125
spitball that page 90 shit?

477
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,670
<i>He's not going to let me leave
until I say...</i>

478
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,088
Honestly, I think it's genius.

479
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,299
Okay...

480
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,053
don't throw the G word around
if you don't mean it, Will.

481
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,846
- I do.
- I knew it.

482
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,183
Man, I wish I could go
to South By Pitch Fest tomorrow.

483
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
It's fine.

484
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,770
Gives us more time
to work the dough, right?

485
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,772
I think we are on a roll.

486
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,982
I think... we should go all night?

487
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,611
<i>How do I get out now
without this six-foot-one baby</i>

488
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,612
<i>throwing a tantrum?</i>

489
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,239
No, no.
You don't want to overwork the dough.

490
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,158
I think you should go to South By tonight.

491
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Pitch it tomorrow.

492
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,787
- For reals?
- Take the red-eye.

493
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
You said Ted Hope is there, right?

494
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,999
Show him you're in demand.

495
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,834
Start a bidding war.

496
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,796
- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

497
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,589
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good for you.

498
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,930
<i>Where you been?</i>

499
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,599
At the market.

500
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,850
For four hours?

501
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,255
You should ask your son.

502
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,729
He wanted to play hide-and-seek
and scare Mommy.

503
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm gonna get the rest of the groceries.

504
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,785
You're old enough to know that your mom...

505
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,539
sometimes accidentally tells a little lie.

506
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,042
But I know you always tell the truth.

507
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,335
Come here, Joey.

508
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,212
Come here.

509
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,556
Pain, it can make people truthful.

510
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,639
Hey.

511
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,642
What you doing with that rope?

512
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,186
Don't worry, it's for Henderson.

513
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,479
Uh-huh...

514
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,068
And what exactly
are you planning to do to him?

515
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,904
Gonna get him to confess on video,

516
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,198
ruin his career, and get him arrested.

517
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,451
Why? What'd you think I was gonna say?

518
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,871
Someone else, not you...

519
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,834
a less stable person might see...

520
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,337
Hendy's depravity
as justification for killing him.

521
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,007
That's not me.

522
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,717
I know.

523
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,720
I know it's not.

524
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,557
You're thoughtful, controlled...

525
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,519
The more I learn about you,

526
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,105
the more clearly I see
the answer to your question.

527
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,857
How can you...

528
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,778
be sure I'll be loyal once you let me out?

529
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,696
The answer is...

530
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,033
there is no answer.

531
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,369
No matter what I say, you will never
be sure if I'll turn you in.

532
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,331
<i>But I need to be sure, Love, for us.</i>

533
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,414
Hold on.

534
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,752
I know you want to do the right thing

535
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,171
or you wouldn't have asked at all.

536
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,175
I've done business with bad people,
you're not them.

537
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,842
You...

538
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,596
do bad things when you feel trapped

539
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,183
or, key, to protect someone, which...

540
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,603
we all hope we would have the courage
to do that.

541
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,606
To me, that makes you more good than bad.

542
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,442
I think you're a good man.

543
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,028
You could kill Henderson,

544
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,572
but you're letting justice
take its course.

545
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,075
That's what a good man would do.

546
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,702
<i>He's biased, but I hope he's right.</i>

547
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,705
But to really be good, Joe,

548
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,374
you have to let me out of here.

549
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,460
<i>Another impossible puzzle, Love,</i>

550
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,004
<i>but for you, I'll try to solve anything.</i>

551
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,179
<i>It's not the best time,
but you always come first.</i>

552
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,263
Hey, you.

553
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,433
Did you tell Forty
to take a red-eye to South By?

554
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,435
I may have mentioned it, yeah.

555
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,147
I really wish you would have asked me.
Film fests are tough on his sobriety.

556
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,732
I didn't realize that, I'm sorry.

557
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,235
I appreciate that,
but it still feels weird,

558
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,070
like you were trying
to get him out of town

559
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,989
so that you wouldn't have
to deal with him.

560
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,950
<i>Being attracted to very smart women
is a double-edged sword.</i>

561
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,744
- I would never do that.
<i>- He said you used the words "bidding war."</i>

562
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
<i>I should lie.</i>

563
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,291
<i>Half-truths just end up getting me burned
so I should lie.</i>

564
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,459
Will, please do not make this worse
by lying to me.

565
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,771
<i>I have to because I can't tell you
the whole truth,</i>

566
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>which happens to be I did it
to save someone helpless.</i>

567
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,924
<i>Speaking of, need to stop her, now.</i>

568
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,634
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

569
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,553
<i>Yeah, I'm... I'm here. I'm here.</i>

570
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,930
You're right.

571
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>I just wasn't thinking. I messed up.</i>

572
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,268
And from now on, I'll do better.

573
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,561
I promise.

574
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,771
That is what I needed to hear.

575
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>Now I have to go.
I don't want to miss my flight.</i>

576
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,775
- Your flight?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

577
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,612
I'm going to be Forty's sober companion
at South By.

578
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>Kill me now.
Kill Forty, kill everything.</i>

579
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,200
- Have a great trip.
<i>- Call you from Austin.</i>

580
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,889
<i>Perfect. Now I have to get Ellie out
of Henderson's, then get his confession.</i>

581
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,122
<i>I'm not sure how to do either.</i>

582
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,540
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

583
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,632
- @Ellie-Eyeballs, hey.
- Hey.

584
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,092
So bad news.
Jonah's girl came down with the flu

585
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,094
and Jonah's the one with the print,

586
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,096
so no screening tonight. Sorry.

587
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,973
Here, I'll call you an Uber.

588
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,475
Wait, dude, I came all this way.

589
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,477
We can still hang.

590
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,937
I can show you my short.

591
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,980
It's still in progress, but...

592
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,316
Listen, we're friends and it's cool.

593
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,276
I mean, you're massively cool, but...

594
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,278
you're also 15,

595
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,656
so we're not hanging out
in my house alone.

596
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,825
<i>What is his game here?</i>

597
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,285
Okay, neurotic.

598
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,163
I'm not some random girl child.

599
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,290
And you said for weeks
you would watch my short.

600
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:40,959
All right, fine.

601
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,962
But you have to promise me
you won't tell anybody

602
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,356
that you were here alone with me, okay?
'Cause it's kinda...

603
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,255
I get it.

604
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,299
I'm a vault. Scout's honor.

605
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,720
<i>Oh, this is his clever trick
to make her feel safe,</i>

606
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,472
<i>like she chose.</i>

607
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,368
You're a filmmaker.

608
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,579
I saw some <i>Rear Window</i>
and a little bit of...

609
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,374
<i>Florida Project,</i> but with your own pathos.

610
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,752
I... I think you could've
held on the last image a bit longer.

611
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,713
That's what I was thinking.

612
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,258
I'm proud of you, Eyeballs.
Now I really wanna hear your feature idea.

613
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,760
Great. I've got a whole pitch prepared...

614
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,722
And I have, like, a super early morning.

615
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,473
Dude, ten minutes.

616
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,351
It's right up your alley
and I think you'll like it enough

617
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
to share it
with your producing partners, really.

618
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,608
Well, I never pitch without
at least one Scotch in me for luck,

619
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,485
so in your case, what do you want? Juice?

620
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,237
Uh, yeah, I'll take a watermelon.

621
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,988
Okay.

622
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,963
<i>No alcohol. Interesting.</i>

623
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,931
<i>And a twist of GHB
for roofie-ing the teenaged girl.</i>

624
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,939
What the heck?

625
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,602
A little piece of advice: don't get a cat.

626
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,273
Here.

627
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,775
Cheers.

628
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,195
To making art.

629
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,909
<i>To his dose kicking in first,
which it will.</i>

630
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,370
<i>It's a hell of a lot stronger.</i>

631
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,453
All right.

632
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,146
What the fuck. Hey.

633
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,729
Hey, hey.

634
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,149
Huh? What?

635
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,360
Easy, easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

636
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,443
Who are you?

637
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,029
Untie me!

638
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,992
- <i>Oh, white male celebrity privilege.</i>
- Help me! Help! Help me!

639
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,244
You know this room is soundproof.

640
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,913
- You built it to be soundproof.
- Help me!

641
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,999
Help me!

642
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,627
I'm going to help you after you confess

643
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,546
to what you've been hiding
in this little...

644
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,006
secret room.

645
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,175
Secret room? What...?

646
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,219
You mean this room
that everybody knows about?

647
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,139
This is just standard, mass-produced
Pleasure Chest kink.

648
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,222
It's not illegal.

649
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,144
<i>Hiding his real perversion
behind healthy fetishes is smart</i>

650
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,061
<i>and evil.</i>

651
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,225
I'm not talking about kink,

652
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,273
I'm talking about your thing
for underage girls.

653
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,942
Like the one upstairs, for starters.

654
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,028
Ellie? I never touched her.

655
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,405
I don't have a thing for underaged girls.
This is insane!

656
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,241
The pictures in your cigar box
suggest otherwise!

657
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,120
Those aren't mine.

658
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm holding them for a friend, all right?
He knows he needs help.

659
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,666
<i>I'm not gonna kill him.</i>

660
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
<i>Just scare him into telling the truth.</i>

661
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,892
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?

662
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,382
No, no no! What do you want?
What do you want?

663
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,635
- Ow!
- No, no! What do you want?!

664
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,595
You know what I want.

665
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,013
The truth.

666
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,390
Okay, okay!
They're mine, they're mine!

667
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,076
Okay, I... I never touched them, I swear.

668
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,245
They would fall asleep
and I would take their tops off,

669
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,980
snap a few photos, which I wouldn't
share with anyone, and then...

670
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,192
Who gets hurt? Nobody.
They don't even remember.

671
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,069
<i>Delilah remembers.</i>

672
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,611
You're wrong.

673
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,698
And if you believe any
of what you just said, you're sick.

674
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,033
These are kids.

675
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,246
Listen, man,
if I did this to your girlfriend...

676
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,165
a long time ago or something,
I'm really sorry.

677
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,333
I'm sorry. I...

678
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,627
I can pay you both.

679
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,920
I don't want your money.

680
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,297
I want your confession on video.

681
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,423
What?

682
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,053
I can't do that.

683
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,264
That would destroy me.
I'd lose everything.

684
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,347
Oh...

685
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,058
You deserve to.

686
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,686
No, no, no! Okay, okay, okay!
I'll do it, I'll do it! Please.

687
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,063
Remember...

688
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,858
this is of your own volition.

689
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,697
Okay.

690
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,991
Don't look so scared. Take a breath.

691
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,537
Now, look into the camera.

692
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,878
What do you want me to say? What, I'm...?

693
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,629
I'm a sicko?

694
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,759
Okay, fine, I'm... I'm bad.

695
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,344
All right, I'm disgusting.

696
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,639
What, do you think I like this shit?!

697
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,185
My stepdad, he... he touched me.

698
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,519
Stop that.

699
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,582
When I told my mom about it,
she made me promise not to tell anyone.

700
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,252
- No, stop. I don't want stories.
- All this started when I was nine.

701
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,154
- I was only nine years old.
- Henderson... Henderson, shut up.

702
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,324
- This happened to you too, didn't it?
- No. No, no, no.

703
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,992
- That's why you're doing this?
- No.

704
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,220
You hate yourself
so you're trying to destroy me?

705
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,287
I'm warning you.

706
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,748
- We're the same.
- No, no...

707
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,336
I'm nothing... like <i>you.</i>

708
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,424
I know you. You...

709
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,345
You're from my party, right?
You're Forty's friend.

710
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,598
You were trying to help him,
you were trying to be a hero.

711
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,075
Is that what you think this is, huh?

712
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,739
You feel like you're a piece of shit
so you're trying to be a hero.

713
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,166
- That's enough.
- Ruining my life is not gonna save you

714
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,901
from your demons, all right?
What we went through, this shit stays.

715
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,653
No amount of sex or drugs
or success or religion

716
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,280
or surviving fucking ball cancer,

717
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,124
that's not gonna save you, okay?
Nothing can.

718
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,409
<i>He's trying to get in my head.</i>

719
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,411
- Love can.
<i>- We're nothing alike.</i>

720
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,121
Love is the biggest phony of them all.

721
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,208
You want something real?
An orgasm is real.

722
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,876
<i>He's desperate.</i>

723
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,129
<i>He's trying to win with words and ideas
that add up to nothing,</i>

724
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,174
<i>but the truth: he is bad.</i>

725
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,843
<i>Someone needs to stop him
and he knows it.</i>

726
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,199
<i>No.</i>

727
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,992
<i>No, this isn't me.</i>

728
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,494
<i>This isn't me anymore.</i>

729
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,831
<i>I didn't want to do that.
I didn't do that.</i>

730
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,000
<i>Get it together.</i>

731
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,930
<i>A suicide.</i>

732
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,749
<i>He slit his wrist, regretted it...</i>

733
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,435
<i>went for help, fell going up the stairs.</i>

734
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,400
<i>No, no no no, can't have another
jar of urine scenario.</i>

735
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,888
<i>Shit.</i>

736
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,232
Hendy?

737
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,293
All right, later, loser.

738
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,710
I'm leaving.

739
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,763
<i>I just have to clean up my blood.</i>

740
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>No, no, no!
That is my blood mixing with his.</i>

741
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,239
<i>The robots are not our friends.</i>

742
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,159
<i>This can still look
like an ill-conceived suicide.</i>

743
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,412
<i>I just need to clean what got smeared</i>

744
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,832
<i>while leaving the rest alone.</i>

745
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,855
<i>I can still be good.</i>

746
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,025
<i>Tonight was just a setback.
Everyone has setbacks.</i>

747
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,541
<i>Okay, okay. Be cool.</i>

748
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,006
- Is there a problem, officer?
- You were illegally crossing, sir.

749
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,302
A little late
to be taking out the trash, huh?

750
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,346
What's in the bag?

751
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,475
Stuff... for Goodwill.

752
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,192
<i>This is it, the end of our story.</i>

753
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,071
<i>Hendy was right, I was delusional
to think love could save me.</i>

754
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,282
What the...?

755
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,788
These are limited edition.

756
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,417
They're too... big.

757
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,961
They're yours if you want 'em.

758
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,675
All right, here.

759
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,303
I was gonna write you up
for jaywalking, but, uh...

760
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,346
you can go.

761
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,355
<i>I've been spared.</i>

762
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,608
<i>I've been saved,
and there has to be a reason for that.</i>

763
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,906
<i>Maybe it's because Hendy was wrong.</i>

764
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,494
<i>Love is real, and I have more to give.</i>

765
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,588
Hey, man, uh, can I get a Texas Trio?

766
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,132
And the bread, is that gluten-free?

767
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,718
Do you have gluten-free bread?
Could you work that out for me?

768
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,962
Yeah, we got that. No problem.

769
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,722
How are you, dude?

770
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,433
Good. Just getting my grub on.

771
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,726
Gonna go on a a diet for sure.

772
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,191
<i>Maybe it's because I help people</i>

773
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,276
<i>who need someone to look out for them.</i>

774
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,743
<i>Growing up,</i>

775
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>I felt unsafe.</i>

776
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,498
<i>Powerless.</i>

777
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,628
I'm so sorry.

778
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,423
You kept Mama's secret.

779
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,552
Joey, you're such a good boy.

780
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,806
Do you want to know another secret?

781
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,809
One of these days...

782
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,353
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

783
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,997
All your fake passport stuff,

784
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,498
everything you need.

785
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,167
You're...

786
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,212
letting me out?

787
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,757
<i>This might be the dumbest mistake
I've ever made,</i>

788
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,966
<i>but if Will's right,</i>

789
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,677
<i>it's also the one thing that will prove...</i>

790
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,596
<i>that I'm good.</i>

791
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,432
I knew it.

792
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,562
I knew you'd do the right thing.

793
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,065
<i>I can rest now, Love,</i>

794
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,942
<i>knowing I'm the man you want me to be</i>

795
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,361
<i>and the bad is behind us.</i>

796
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,372
- You ready?
<i>- </i>Yeah, but we need to buy another ticket.

797
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:17,000
I met this, uh,
total smokeshow at breakfast.

798
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,086
We were both reaching for the <i>queso,</i>

799
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,295
and it was, like, this...

800
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,881
insane destiny moment.

801
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,758
That's not like you.

802
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,594
I know. Um, I just...

803
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,305
Look, I've never felt
like this before, okay?

804
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,058
Just, like, instantly, like...
Oh, my God, there she is.

805
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,727
You look amazing.

806
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,981
Um, this... this is my sister, Love.

807
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,108
Hi.

808
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,777
I'm Amy.

809
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,759
