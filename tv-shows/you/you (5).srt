1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,010
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,639
Your old phone, which I have,
is still logged into the cloud.

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,684
And that means I'm still logged into you.

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,685
I'm a poet.

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,270
- Get off the stage.
- Wrap it up.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,606
Did you move here to be something?
I did. But it's not working out.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,442
Do you think I'm unremarkable?

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,987
Unremarkable people don't worry
about being unremarkable.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,030
-So good to see you, hon.
-You, too, Dad.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,450
The addict part was true, I see,
but he never died.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,619
He's here. He's alive.
Could be helpful to write about him.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,621
Benji was the worst kind of poison.

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,332
The peanut allergy was real.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,210
I guess Benji's gonna die an honest man.

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,882
- It's not okay to yell.
- Grown-ups do it all the time.

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,300
Grown-ups are assholes.

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,719
I told this guy,
stay away from my girlfriend's kid.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,012
He just seems a little neglected.

19
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,680
-That's it! I--
-All right! All right!

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,474
This is a lovely collection.

21
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,811
That's funny. There's a book missing.
Joe was looking at it.

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,814
I, of course, never had
any intention of keeping the book.

23
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,858
If Peach still has a problem,

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,235
I won't let her
get in the way of us, Beck. I won't.

25
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,747
Good morning.
This is my favorite time of day.

26
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,665
When it's just the two of us.

27
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,882
Were you watching me sleep?

28
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,557
Creeper.

29
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,524
I love our little routine.
Always the same, but never stale.

30
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,194
Sex. Showers. More sex.

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,989
Breakfast. Avocado salted, bacon crispy.
Every day.

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,120
Your father was never consistent,
and you're still healing from that.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
With my help.

34
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,500
Mmm. Do you mind if I keep working?
I just have tons--

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,378
Eat. Work. I'll fold the laundry.

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,047
That's right, Beck,
I even do your damn laundry.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,633
I protect your time.
I let you focus on your work.

38
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,594
And guess what?
Now that I've made our mornings sacred,

39
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,096
you're actually writing.

40
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,098
Free of distraction.

41
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,475
Mostly.

42
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,854
Ron and Claudia again?

43
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,898
If the goddamn dishes ever got done,

44
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,026
I wouldn't be bumping
into a goddamn stack of plates.

45
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,195
Can't you say something?

46
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,447
I don't like to mess
with other people's lives.

47
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,577
Maybe you should.
Anyway, I gotta get to class.

48
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,956
The worst thing about our mornings?

49
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,208
They always end.

50
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,172
I pass the time by counting down
to the next moment I see you.

51
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,798
You're teaching me to be more patient.

52
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,261
And God knows I need the help
when it comes to your friends.

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,680
For some reason,
we share our nights with your friends

54
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,266
and appointment-viewing like The Bachelor.

55
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,061
How can self-respecting women
tolerate this crap?

56
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,480
Sometimes I swear
I'm the only real feminist you know.

57
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,609
It's either a full Brazilian,
or, like, full bush.

58
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,195
And it's like, "Listen, my snooch
is the third bowl of porridge."

59
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,198
I mean, meet me halfway, lady.
It's, like, insane.

60
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,491
That's hilarious.

61
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,952
These girls
are even more tedious in person.

62
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,665
Lynn is a dark cavern
where conversations go to die.

63
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,750
That's hilarious.

64
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,503
What personality she has is only
activated by low-calorie girly cocktails,

65
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,048
which is doubtless why she drinks so much.

66
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,759
Annika's decided I'm so amazing,
which true,

67
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,636
but joining Team Joe
is just the latest move

68
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,638
in her cold war with Queen Bitch herself.

69
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,848
Peach goddamn Salinger.

70
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,808
Hope you didn't
start the fun without me.

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,976
We did.

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,646
Annika, thank God
for that chest of yours.

73
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,441
Otherwise, you'd be spilling guac all over
that Himalayan blanket I got Beck.

74
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,236
So goes the endless merry-go-round
of food issues.

75
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,906
Peach snipes at Annika's body,
Annika rubs her assets in Peach's face,

76
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,534
which, as defense mechanisms go,
beats the hell out of crying.

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,787
I can get you some paper towels.

78
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,831
Wait up. I need a refill.

79
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,750
No, no. I got it. I'll take care of you.

80
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,502
No. It's all right.
I could use the company.

81
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,300
This is so much more fun
than girls' night classic.

82
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,302
You know, when it was just us girls?

83
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,096
Peach has it out for me.

84
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,390
Probably shouldn't have stolen
her copy of Oz.

85
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,891
Or maybe I shouldn't have returned it.

86
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,143
But all that's behind me, Beck.

87
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,853
If I just keep being
the perfect boyfriend,

88
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,440
you'll realize that life is
so much healthier away from this toxicity.

89
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,778
Joseph, I was thinking
about thinning out my library,

90
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,031
and I thought I'd ask the expert.
What's a book like this worth?

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,117
She's still trying to build a case

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,952
that I'd be willing to
swipe the damn thing.

93
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:51,082
It's printed by Reilly &amp; Britton.
An original. A rarity.

94
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,083
Hmm.

95
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,086
Guess I better act quick.

96
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,047
Before some desperate person
tries to steal my little beauty away.

97
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,550
The real tragedy would be
not appreciating what you have.

98
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,177
If I were you, I'd hold onto her forever.

99
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,596
But what do I know?
I'm just a bookstore clerk.

100
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,312
I'm trying, Beck. I am.

101
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,440
But your friends
bring out the worst in me.

102
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,285
And then Rastiche taught me this.

103
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,290
- D minor. Goosebumps, man.
- Is that a D minor?

104
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,584
Hi, Joe!

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,837
This place is...

106
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,298
musty.

107
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,051
Hi! Hi!

108
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,927
Annika, what brings you to Mooney's?

109
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:50,558
Your website,
and the deep sadness it evokes.

110
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,146
I mean,
did you do this in Myspace?

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,399
I've been telling Joe
we need to modernize.

112
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,943
Joe, I have 3.6 million followers.

113
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,071
And I get 12k for a selfie in glasses,

114
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:08,743
but I'm willing to do Mooney's for free
out of the kindness of my big-ass heart.

115
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,623
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yay!

116
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,710
If you need some authentic
Russian folk vibes, I can...

117
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,338
Thank you. But I got this.

118
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,973
"Smart bitches get their brains juiced
at Mooney's. Hashtag, stacked."

119
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,310
If you ever wonder what it takes
to become an influencer,

120
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:38,231
specifically, a body-positive Insta-celeb,
be shameless.

121
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,358
Annika's turning her curves
into an empire.

122
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,819
Inspiring the ladies,
arousing the gentlemen.

123
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,945
Everyone wins.

124
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,572
It'd be genuinely empowering
if it weren't so clearly a rebellion

125
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,243
against being Peach's, quote,
"fat friend from prep school."

126
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,375
And what's this?
Thank you, Annika's private Facebook.

127
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,544
Hello, nose job.

128
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,339
And just like that, I know how to repay
Annika for her kindness.

129
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,009
Annika, why the hell
is this not on your Insta?

130
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,387
Oh, my God,
because it's mortifying?

131
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,723
I mean, I'm adorkable, but Peach...

132
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:19,313
Lucky she is not on Facebook.
It is cute, though.

133
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,402
Do you run everything you post
by Peach first?

134
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,486
Hell, no!

135
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,450
You're right. Screw it.
This is the ultimate throwback.

136
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,994
I just need a brilliant caption.

137
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:38,040
How about,
"Bitches being our most authentic selves"?

138
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,792
Joe,

139
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,504
it's like you're in my brain.

140
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,923
No, I just know her audience.

141
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,635
Team Joe, one. Peach, zero.

142
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,263
You'd be proud of me, Beck.
I'm a good friend.

143
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,229
Hi, Allison. You wanted to see me?

144
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,606
Guinevere. Please, sit.

145
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,570
I understand that some things
are harder than others to write about.

146
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,032
Our own families
are usually the top of the list.

147
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,535
-I'm glad you stuck with it.
-Thank you.

148
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,579
My lit agent's assistant just got promoted

149
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,290
and may be able to connect you
with some jobs for hire.

150
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,501
Personal essays, reviews--

151
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm in. I am so in! Thank you, Allison.

152
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,382
-I'll forward her contact info to you.
-Okay!

153
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,761
And Beck?

154
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,139
I was sorry to read about
your father's passing.

155
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,692
Peach tried hard
to get you for a girls' night.

156
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,946
But you picked me.
Joe, two. Peach, bupkis.

157
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,698
Whoa!

158
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,494
I think you might be
a little overdressed for sushi.

159
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,705
No. You're under-dressed
for the celebration I have planned.

160
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,794
The theme of our evening
is Fitzgerald and Zelda.

161
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,924
-Ooh. Which one of us is Zelda?
-Me, obviously.

162
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,553
We begin at The Palm Court,

163
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,390
where our literary couple famously danced
in the Plaza fountain.

164
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,350
Where a burger costs 30 bucks.

165
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,645
You're gonna wanna be
in something a little jazzier.

166
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,775
We will be sitting in the very booth
where F. Scott conceived of Gatsby.

167
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,026
That seems fake.

168
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,988
And then, after we've snarked
about our $50 goat cheesecake,

169
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,531
a horse-drawn carriage will take us

170
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,533
-to an even more exclusive club...
-No way.

171
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,909
...where Zelda herself...

172
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,454
danced the night away.

173
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,542
Oh, that's weird. Annika never calls.

174
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,754
Hey, Annika.

175
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

176
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,802
What video?

177
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,181
I've got a bad feeling, Beck.

178
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,145
"Click on my profile." Hmm.

179
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,732
I have black guys that say, like,

180
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,651
they see me and they're all like,
"Damn, girl." You know?

181
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,615
Where are the white guys
that want a girl with a big butt?

182
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,493
Posted anonymously. Yikes.

183
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,122
This looks old,
but casual racism is evergreen.

184
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,459
And the Internet is turning against Annika
at the speed of outrage.

185
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,461
Of course, I can come over.

186
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,214
But the timing, Beck.
A video from college? Today?

187
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,508
In response to
Annika taking a stand against Peach?

188
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,135
Connect the damn dots.

189
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,222
-I have to go. Annika's having, like--
-Okay, go. Be with your friend.

190
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,933
Help her push Peach out a window.

191
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,227
-I'll text you tomorrow.
-Okay.

192
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,899
I made a mistake.
I underestimated Peach. Her cruelty.

193
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,193
Today, it's Annika.
Tomorrow, it could be you. Us.

194
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,196
Beck, I may never be able to prove

195
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,616
your best friend is capable of
destroying you with a flick of her wrist,

196
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,285
but that won't stop me from trying.

197
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,584
I'm sorry I'll miss you this morning.
But this is what it's come to.

198
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,045
I'm running. I'm a runner now.

199
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,215
Until yesterday,
I put all my effort into avoiding Peach.

200
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,675
But you know what they say.

201
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,344
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies...

202
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,390
Keep losing your enemies
because you're so goddamn out of shape.

203
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,184
Why does my kidney hurt?

204
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,270
This is torture,
but I have to know what we're up against.

205
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,731
I need to get into her head.

206
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:36,404
So, exhibit A. Peach starts every day
by punishing her own body.

207
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,949
Sadomasochist? Orthorexic?
Jury's still out.

208
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,452
Exhibit B. Peach is loathed at work.

209
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,040
Jayden, the Jacobsen chairs you ordered
are knock-offs.

210
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,126
And the specs on the Vanderbilt townhouse

211
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,420
were supposed to be
in my office by 7:00 a.m.

212
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,921
It's 6:50.

213
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,424
Entitled? Nepotized?
I'm getting warmer.

214
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,801
She doesn't go anywhere
without that laptop.

215
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,429
If only I could see inside.

216
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,723
Exhibit C in our tour of Peach's psyche.

217
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,725
Gauche? Demented?

218
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,561
If this is the fruit
of Peach's imagination,

219
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,771
there's no telling
what horrors she's capable of.

220
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,984
At least I have your old phone.

221
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,695
So, I sometimes get a warning
before Miss Congeniality appears.

222
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,661
Hey. Is Joseph here?

223
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,707
-Yeah, he's somewhere working.
-Oh.

224
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,208
Good morning, Joseph.

225
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,463
Anyways, what's the big news?

226
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,506
Okay, so, I didn't want to be tacky

227
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,009
and steal the spotlight
from Annika's meltdown last night,

228
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,388
but my professor
is hooking me up with an agent.

229
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,726
Beck, that's amazing
and surprising, but...

230
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,979
Shit! I'm so mad at myself.

231
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,564
What do you mean?

232
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,611
You know, with my family and everything,
I have agency connections.

233
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,822
So, I was gonna call a friend.
Roger Stevens.

234
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,202
Roger Stevens?
Doesn't he rep, like, famous writers?

235
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,372
You mean, like, Pulitzer winners,
Booker Prize finalists,

236
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,500
67% of the Times Best Sellers list?

237
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,128
Yeah, Beck, I'd say Roger Stevens
has repped some famous writers,

238
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,797
which, no offense, begs the question:

239
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,467
Why would he be interested
in an MFA student?

240
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,969
You can write for magazines, totally.

241
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,015
You know? That's legit, honest work.
Like what Annika does.

242
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,521
But Roger doesn't sell articles, you know?
He represents real authors.

243
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,190
So, it just depends on who you want to be.

244
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,276
I mean, if you can introduce us--

245
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,403
Happy to.
Yeah, he and I know each other

246
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,656
from when he was a counselor
at my Jew camp, so...

247
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,618
You know what?

248
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,163
Joseph? Joseph! Joseph?

249
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,623
I didn't know you were here, Peach. Hey.

250
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,459
We are gonna need you
to shut this place down tomorrow night

251
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,627
for a private party.

252
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,128
You know, it's perfect.

253
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,173
Roger is obsessed with
the sad and gritty New York.

254
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,759
I'll take care of everything,
if you can just...

255
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,096
you know, clean up a little.

256
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,431
Really, Peach?
God, you're amazing.

257
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,683
- Of course.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,143
You don't owe me anything, okay?

259
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,396
Happy to.

260
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,649
Oh, but you do, Beck.

261
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,944
But what am I supposed to do,
root for your failure?

262
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,238
That's not love. That's not me.

263
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,451
Wuthering Heights, huh?

264
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,960
It's a near-perfect cover...

265
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,632
for "Juvenilia: The Prosecution of Minors
in New York State."

266
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,814
I hear what goes on when Ron gets drunk.

267
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,402
I get it. You want options.
Legally-defensible options.

268
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,237
Maybe you're figuring out
what would happen

269
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,238
if you took a swing at Ron.

270
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,326
Put yourself between him and your mom?

271
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,786
Well, screw the book.
I can tell you what'll happen.

272
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,623
Best case, you hurt him.

273
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,708
Worst case, he hurts you back.

274
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,126
Someone at school will see
what he did to you.

275
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,630
Next thing you know, CPS is at your door.
You have 30 minutes to pack a bag.

276
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,507
Your mom loses custody.

277
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,010
You get punted from group home
to group home to group home

278
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,928
until you're 18.

279
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,555
Or you get fed up
and see if you can hack it on the streets.

280
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,184
Maybe you can do that. I couldn't.

281
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,746
Read this instead.

282
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,040
The Count of Monte Cristo.
It's another Dumas.

283
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,375
And we'll talk when you're done.

284
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,668
What's it about?

285
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,545
Revenge.

286
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,715
But more importantly,
living with the enemy.

287
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,182
♪ Just clap your hands now ♪

288
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,019
♪ Never did I ever
Mean to make a mess ♪

289
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,982
So, he gives the Pulitzer back,
and he's like,

290
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,443
"I'll have to trust you.
I wrote the whole thing on acid."

291
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,658
Hi.

292
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,370
- I thought you said this would be casual.
- Oh.

293
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,497
- Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Wait.

294
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
I need to get a drink first.

295
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,217
Don't be nervous.

296
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,802
Just be yourself.

297
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,846
I can't be myself.

298
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,098
I mean, the only reason
an agent like Roger Stevens

299
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,017
would even be interested in me
are my stupid essays

300
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,478
about my stupid dead dad
who's very much alive.

301
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,315
Okay, so don't be yourself.
Be more interesting.

302
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,861
You know, half the authors
you've ever read made up personas.

303
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,195
You know,

304
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,032
the Fitzgerald-in-a-fountain story
is tourism-fueled bullshit.

305
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,869
So give this guy a version of Beck

306
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,914
birthed by the same
formidable, creative mind

307
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,083
that put those words to paper.

308
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,090
Fitzgerald.

309
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,925
And Zelda.

310
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:44,897
Roger, this is Guinevere Beck,
the writer I was telling you about.

311
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,484
- Guinevere, milady, I love it!
- It's so old-fashioned!

312
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,071
Just call me Beck.
A lady I am not.

313
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,366
Well, I'm gonna go check on
the pear water. Be back.

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,120
So, how long have you known Peach?

315
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,581
Since her Adderall days. You?

316
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,001
You know,
since I started selling her Adderall.

317
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,882
Hard not to stare, right?

318
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,467
Roger keeps it tight.

319
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,804
I guess the book business
isn't always so pale and flaccid.

320
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,765
Did Beck tell you
I started jogging?

321
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,143
Fun. Runner's high is better than sex.

322
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,187
And for some, may last longer.

323
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,357
Touché, bitch.

324
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,943
Honestly, I'm starting to think
people who run just hate themselves.

325
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,446
No. It's all about the music, Joseph.

326
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,866
Find the right song,
and the whole thing becomes effortless.

327
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,826
Like Roger and Beck.

328
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,704
Can I be honest?

329
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,166
She's lucky she has me.

330
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,169
Beck rarely knows what's best for her.

331
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,547
I couldn't agree more.

332
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,041
Of course. Password-protected.
It's too risky.

333
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,543
Peach is already paranoid.

334
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,728
So, these are the humans
that made a creature like Peach.

335
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,148
God forbid a hair's out of place
for the country club crowd.

336
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,860
Bingo.

337
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,279
Diary.

338
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,535
Food diary. Christ, is there no end
to the neuroses?

339
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,121
Hello.

340
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,624
How old were you
when this was taken, Beck?

341
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,792
And what is Peach doing with it?

342
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,880
Hello, Joe.

343
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,551
Sorry I'm so wet.

344
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,171
Your friend is feisty.
Can she write?

345
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,258
There's potential.
She's not quite there yet, though.

346
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,219
MFA programs are such a scam.

347
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,720
You want me to give your friend
some advice?

348
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,723
She wants to be a real writer,
she should drop out.

349
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,225
I'm working on it.

350
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,936
Just, you know,
be gentle turning her down.

351
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,355
It sucks to be right, Beck.

352
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,191
Peach is trying to sabotage your career.

353
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,485
And I have to know why.

354
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
Here are some of
the most common passwords.

355
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,960
Password. 123456. Babygirl.

356
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,086
"Babygirl," really?

357
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,256
In any case, I doubt Peach is that stupid.

358
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,009
So, I'm outsourcing to someone
who's known her longer.

359
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,178
Hey, Annika. How are you holding up?

360
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,973
Well, I lost all my sponsors
'cause they're all a bunch of pussies,

361
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,433
a third of my Instagram followers,

362
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,561
and the only person who tweeted
in my defense was a Kardashian, so...

363
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,354
I mean, honestly,
where's the witch hunt for the guy

364
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,691
who saw a black-out-drunk girl
and decided to whip out his camera?

365
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,068
- Where's Beck?
- At my place.

366
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,821
She's revising one of her pieces.
She's been slammed.

367
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,282
Not too busy to party with Peach, though.

368
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,452
But, hey, that's Peach.
Beck's her favorite puppy.

369
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,163
-"Puppy"?
-She treats her like a pet, right?

370
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,292
Every day, it's like, "Beckalicious this,"
and "Beckalicious that."

371
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,044
And you know Beck secretly loves it.

372
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,172
The two of them are so co-dependent.

373
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,426
I'm sorry.
I know she's your girlfriend. I...

374
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,679
No. You know,
in Beck's defense, she really is writing.

375
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,306
I'm pushing her to make her deadlines.

376
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,017
Well, ain't you boyfriend of the year?

377
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,602
-I try.
-Yeah.

378
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,896
Hey, did Peach ever have any real pets?

379
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,398
Lame segue. I need the password.

380
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,859
-Um... Dalloway.
-Dalloway.

381
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,112
Yeah. A purebred bichon frise, obviously.

382
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,699
Yeah, Peach was, like,
devastated when she ran away.

383
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,826
I'm sorry,
I just need to work through this out loud.

384
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,827
It's like...

385
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,995
You know who gets away with

386
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,165
a self-deprecating joke
that's a little risqué?

387
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,000
And by "risqué," she means racist.

388
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,043
The fat girl.

389
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,713
Everybody laughs because she is harmless
and drunk and funny,

390
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,298
but, like, in a fat way.

391
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,634
But you know who gets crucified
for that same risqué joke?

392
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,260
Again, to be clear, racist.

393
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,222
The former fat girl
who is actually just embracing her body.

394
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,848
I mean, girls won't let girls just...

395
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,683
be.

396
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,771
Thank God. This was a huge mistake.

397
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,731
Sorry, it's Beck.

398
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,150
Hey. What's up?

399
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,903
So, Peach is here.

400
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,739
As in, here in your apartment.

401
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,827
Something about a stolen laptop.

402
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,673
Why don't you save us the embarrassment
and tell me where it is?

403
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,842
Is it in the kitchen?
Is it under the sofa?

404
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,801
Some little hidey-hole

405
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,219
where you squirrel away
all your stolen goods?

406
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,388
-Stolen goods? Okay, slow down.
-Yeah.

407
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,764
I don't know
what you're talking about.

408
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,807
Yes, you do.

409
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,184
Last night, you left halfway through.
Where did you go, Joseph?

410
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,227
Probably to take a piss?

411
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,563
Peach, believe it or not,
I can afford my own computer.

412
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,941
Beck. Help me out.

413
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,526
I don't know.

414
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,696
-What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.

415
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,322
I mean, of course you didn't...

416
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,951
I just...
Please don't put me in the middle of this.

417
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,167
Okay, Peach, if your laptop is stolen,
I believe you.

418
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,295
But the people at the party
weren't exactly strapped for cash, so...

419
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,337
I don't know, I mean,

420
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,007
is there, like, some other
more personal reason

421
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,508
someone would mess with you?

422
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,885
Oh, my God, Peach.

423
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,553
Weren't you just saying last week

424
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,889
that you were feeling unsafe
in your own home?

425
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,267
Whoa. I...

426
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,562
I mean, you run out in the open
every morning.

427
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,689
You're very pretty. You're a Salinger.

428
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,775
What if someone's creeping on you?

429
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,653
It wouldn't be the first time.

430
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,655
It wouldn't? Hallelujah.

431
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,701
Let's just say that James Franco and I
didn't end well.

432
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,036
We should call the police.

433
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,871
What are they gonna do?

434
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,748
Interrogate every single one
of Peach's friends?

435
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,416
Good luck convincing them
it's not just misplaced.

436
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,753
I'm sorry, I have to ask.
Have you tried Find My Computer yet?

437
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
It's just this little GPS--

438
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,175
I don't need you to mansplain
Find My Computer.

439
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,219
-I know how to do it.
-Okay.

440
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,558
Peach, isn't that your place?

441
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,436
She didn't think I'd be dumb enough
to bring her laptop here, did she?

442
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,983
Classy apology.

443
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,401
Joe, stop it.

444
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,239
Stop what? That was some bullshit, Beck.

445
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,491
And you didn't exactly rush to my defense.

446
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,161
What was I supposed to do?
You two are always sniping at each other.

447
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,829
And breaking into
each other's places,

448
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,789
but that's not the point.

449
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,916
She has had it out for me
from the first day we met.

450
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,209
No, she hasn't.

451
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,126
Are you blind?

452
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,421
Maybe you can't see it,
but Peach is next-level vindictive.

453
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,923
You know what?
If you hate my friends so much,

454
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,634
- why do you hang out with them?
- Because you force me to!

455
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,428
-If I didn't, I wouldn't see you.
-I don't have time for this.

456
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,140
I was supposed to send my pages
to Roger Stevens, like, an hour ago.

457
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,559
He doesn't care. He doesn't care.
He doesn't care.

458
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,894
He doesn't care!

459
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,855
He's never gonna sign you.

460
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,900
Peach is setting you up to fail.
I heard them talking at the party.

461
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,152
Roger thinks MFAs are a waste of time,
and Peach said herself

462
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,780
she thinks that you are not ready.

463
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,659
I'm sorry. I know the truth hurts,
but I have to set you free.

464
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,370
You are an asshole.

465
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,040
You know, if you don't believe in me,
just say so.

466
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,543
Don't come up with
some bullshit conspiracy theory.

467
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,628
No, Beck. Wait. No. I'm telling the truth.

468
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,672
You're allowed to be jealous of Roger.

469
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,842
I get it, you're a guy.
Boo-hoo, he's young and successful.

470
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,969
- No, that's not... No, wait. No, no.
- I don't care.

471
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,264
The last thing I would've expected
you to be was unsupportive.

472
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,103
Our first fight.

473
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,939
It was worse than I could've imagined.

474
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,066
And it's all thanks to Peach.

475
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,569
I want to punish her
for coming between us.

476
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,030
But I can't. I'm not that guy.

477
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,449
I'm an understanding,
supportive boyfriend.

478
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,076
I'm barely clever enough
to have gotten away with this.

479
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,621
The last piece of the Peach puzzle.
Proof that she has it out for you.

480
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,374
Here we go. "Dalloway."

481
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,501
God, even the dog is pretentious.

482
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,170
Thanks for nothing, Annika.

483
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,921
"Beckalicious this,"
and "Beckalicious that."

484
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,718
There's no way this works.
But also, please work.

485
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,055
Okay. Officially skeeved.

486
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,100
Not sure what I'm looking for,
but I'll know it when I...

487
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,686
Oh. "GB." Guinevere Beck?

488
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,272
What the hell?

489
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,191
Is this blackmail?

490
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,361
No, there's too much of it.
Going too far back.

491
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,529
I know what it's like
to be in love with you, Beck.

492
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,824
This is not what love looks like.
This isn't how love behaves.

493
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,284
This is the work of a sick mind.

494
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,870
Let's call it what it is. Perversion.

495
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,831
Now I understand
why Peach is setting you up for failure.

496
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,460
She's not threatened by you.
She's obsessed with you.

497
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,963
You know
I love you forever, right?

498
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,508
She wants to watch you,
have you, control you

499
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,635
like she controls
every other piece of her life.

500
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,178
She wants you all to herself.

501
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,222
Beck...

502
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,891
you've got a stalker.

503
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,607
Stop me if you've heard this one before.

504
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,610
A girl grows up
in a strict, old-money family

505
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,154
where any deviations from tradition
are punished.

506
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,866
Two choices:
be like them or be excommunicated.

507
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,201
No love, no money.

508
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,620
At some point, she makes a friend.
That's you, Beck.

509
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,497
She develops a harmless crush.

510
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,875
And it's 2018, so who gives a shit
if she's gay or bi or pan

511
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,421
or just a mortal in the presence of your
dangerous and exceptional pheromones?

512
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,382
I'll tell you who. Her family.
And she knows it.

513
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,552
So she takes her normal, healthy feelings
and crushes them.

514
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,055
Nurses them in a dark,
secret place for years.

515
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,892
Until they mutate into an obsession.
A sickness.

516
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:53,314
And now, your best friend is a stalker
and a sociopath and... Oh, God. A liar.

517
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,066
Runner's high is a myth.

518
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,485
Why the hell did I take up jogging again?

519
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,903
I'm in hell, Beck.

520
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,823
Even if I could share the proof,
you'd never believe me.

521
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,702
And now you're not even talking to me,
which means you're in trouble.

522
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,000
Look at you,
like a little literary hooker.

523
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,251
Get in!

524
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,715
Hey.

525
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,843
I so appreciate you reading my stuff.

526
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,012
Thank you for being down to ride.

527
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,474
I've got this Met benefit lunch
downtown this afternoon.

528
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,851
I figured you and I
could just bang it out.

529
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,104
Hey, office hours are better
without the office.

530
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,481
Well said.

531
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,194
Hey, speaking of.
These essays, these poems...

532
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,155
Loved, loved, loved every page.

533
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,698
Oh, my God. Really?

534
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,492
Fathers are the worst.

535
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,244
It's like their job is to mess us up.

536
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,040
What if we all just had two moms, right?
There'd be no wars. None.

537
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
I know, right?

538
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,168
Okay.

539
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,755
I'm gonna be real with you.

540
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,385
I think some of your stuff is problematic.

541
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,888
Wait. What do you mean?

542
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,307
Addiction is a disease.

543
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,436
And you wanna put your dead dad
on trial for being a victim?

544
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,482
I think the one you're talking about,

545
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,027
it's meant to be about forgiveness.

546
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,409
I'm sorry. That is my bad.

547
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,328
I skimmed.

548
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,878
So, what's your thing?

549
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,840
Is it, "Like daddy, like daughter"?

550
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,759
-Ow. Shit.
-What the hell? What are you doing?

551
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,219
Will you relax?

552
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,847
Here, take one of these.

553
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,100
No, I don't take anything.

554
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,644
Jesus, no wonder
I couldn't get through your stuff.

555
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,021
Peach was right. You have a lot to learn.

556
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,357
You think sobriety created
Joyce Carol Oates, sweetheart?

557
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,568
-You have a problem.
-You're a judgy little bitch.

558
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,694
Could you pull over?

559
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,571
This book is crap.

560
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,574
He waits 24 years to get justice?

561
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,950
What kind of message is that?

562
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,411
A smart one. It's all about the long game.

563
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,954
My mom needs help now.

564
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,540
Sometimes, putting yourself
between two people

565
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,376
is a surefire way to make things worse.

566
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,087
I promise you, we're not gonna let
anything happen to you or your mom.

567
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,672
It's too late.

568
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,141
Beckish? I got your SOS.

569
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,894
Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? Come here.

570
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,063
You set me up.

571
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,565
Excuse me?

572
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,776
Your friend, Roger Stevens,
was an asshole and a freak.

573
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,196
He doesn't want to sign me.
He never wanted to sign me.

574
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,366
This whole thing was just
designed to humiliate me.

575
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,785
Okay, calm down and tell me what happened.

576
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,746
He didn't even read my stuff.

577
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,707
He was a rude, entitled douche
who only wanted to get high and,

578
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,502
I wish I was exaggerating,
bang me in a limo.

579
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,047
- Okay.
- And you sent me there!

580
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,257
I had no idea that he was using again.

581
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,301
I mean, he's been clean since 9/11.

582
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,220
Beck, when it happened,
he was in an airport.

583
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,348
I don't give a shit!

584
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,350
You threw me under the bus!

585
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,685
"She's got a lot to learn"?

586
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,062
Go to hell.

587
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:23,191
Joe was right.
You live to cut down your friends.

588
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,735
Okay. I don't know
what your boyfriend told you--

589
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,780
Don't lie to me, Peach. I'm not stupid.
I'm not Annika.

590
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,035
Oh, come on. Annika may not remember
the night she went on that rant, but I do.

591
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:39,248
Junior year, Marcy House?
I was there. We were both there.

592
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,834
Are you accusing me of sabotaging Annika?

593
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,214
And me, and anyone else
who edges into your spotlight.

594
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,384
You would rather pick apart your friends
than maybe admit

595
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,054
that you're not being
your most amazing self right now.

596
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:57,225
It is exhausting being your friend!

597
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,688
I don't know what to say.

598
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,690
I mean, it was a favor, Beck.

599
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,900
And I don't need to love
your self-absorbed poetry

600
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,151
in order to be kind to you.

601
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,280
Where are you going?

602
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,783
Beck.

603
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,328
Beck? Come back.

604
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,673
♪ No one knows what it's like ♪

605
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,469
♪ You and me ♪

606
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,848
♪ You and I ♪

607
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,103
Can I come in?

608
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,127
I owe you an apology.

609
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,755
You were right.

610
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,842
About Peach's douchebag agent.
About Peach.

611
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,470
I told you so.
I told you so.

612
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,929
I'm so sorry.

613
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,642
How do you see things so clearly?

614
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,395
I mean, things I can't even
see for myself?

615
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,149
You must hate me.

616
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,859
Are you kidding?

617
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,070
I loathe you.

618
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,240
Get out of here, you trash goblin!

619
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,618
Whatever. This place is a dump.

620
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,619
Is it honesty o'clock?

621
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,622
Because I've been saving up
some intense constructive criticism.

622
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,584
No, I can't handle it!
Back to secrets and lies, please.

623
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,847
-Ignore that.
-You think?

624
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm sorry. This is gonna keep happening.

625
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,315
She needs to get the message now.

626
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,319
You need to stop calling me.

627
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:15,905
Peach?

628
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,493
I just wanted to say
you were right.

629
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,497
I'm a bitch. I'm sorry.

630
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,998
Peach, what's going on?

631
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:30,044
Nothing. I just took some pills.

632
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,170
Which pills?

633
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,048
All of them.

634
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,218
Peach?

635
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,475
Peach? Peach?

636
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,061
Peach?

637
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,146
Oh, no.

638
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,648
Joe, I need towels,

639
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,694
and there's a naloxone spray
in the guest bathroom.

640
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,654
- Which one is that?
- It's downstairs!

641
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,675
That's good. Get it all out.

642
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,179
Thanks.

643
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,181
Where's the nasal spray?

644
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,641
- Shit, it must've come out in the hallway.
- It's fine. I'll get it.

645
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,976
- You sure?
- Yeah.

646
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,151
No way.

647
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,987
Peach logged her own suicide?

648
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,241
200 milligrams ibuprofen,
15 milligrams Wellbutrin.

649
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,661
There isn't enough in her system
for a light buzz, let alone an OD.

650
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,622
I see you spying, Joseph.

651
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,376
And you can't prove I wrote it all down.

652
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,796
Jesus, Beck.

653
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,467
This whole thing is an act.

654
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,635
A trap.

655
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,553
Tell me you see it.

656
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,679
I'll call the hospital.

657
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,722
No.

658
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,935
They'll put a 72-hour hold on me.
I'll be committed.

659
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,728
Exactly.

660
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,820
Beck, if this is real,
she needs to go to a hospital.

661
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,031
"If this is real"?

662
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,827
Did you even try to find the naloxone?

663
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
Joseph.

664
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,507
Joe, you wait outside.

665
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,175
Yeah.

666
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,849
Thank you for saving me.

667
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,270
Joe does have a point.

668
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,021
You should get a checkup.

669
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:03,155
What if instead you just stayed the night?

670
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,158
Just in case anything happens.

671
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,660
Whatever you need.

672
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,635
Beck, what I said
about her faking it--

673
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,138
Ugh, please, Joe. Stop.

674
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,264
She could've died.

675
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,057
We're not that lucky.

676
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,350
You two had one fight.

677
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,478
She tries to off herself, like that?
It doesn't add up.

678
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,400
This isn't the first time
Peach has tried to kill herself.

679
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,819
You're kidding.

680
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,531
I've talked her off of a ledge
more times than I can count.

681
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:50,786
So when she needs me, she really needs me.

682
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,129
I understand.

683
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,007
I understand that I'm too late.

684
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,676
There's too much history.

685
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,936
I understand
without a shadow of a doubt...

686
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,939
Peach wins.

687
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:33,079
How is a normal guy supposed to compete
with a rich, unstable stalker

688
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,998
who'd rather fake her own suicide
than be apart from you?

689
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,086
Your whole life is braided with Peach's.

690
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,838
Inseparable, now and forever,

691
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,841
until she drags you
into her own personal Grey Gardens.

692
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,720
Right now, she's probably
sinking her claws deeper.

693
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,953
You think wrecking this place
is gonna solve our problems?

694
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,246
Are you high again?

695
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,138
Another person I failed to help.

696
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,601
I thought I could better myself for you.
I couldn't.

697
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,111
I tried to be the perfect boyfriend,
the perfect friend to your friends,

698
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,531
and it wasn't enough. So, to hell with it.

699
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,536
It's freeing in a way,
to know so definitively where I stand.

700
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,996
Where you stand.

701
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,458
To know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

702
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,838
And just like that,
everything clicks into place.

703
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,257
My feet. Runner's high.

704
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,717
It is pretty great.

705
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,472
And I remember
this is why I took up jogging.

706
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,688
♪ You must run and hide ♪

707
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,649
♪ For the hunter, he seeks ♪

708
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,986
♪ With his devilish pride ♪

709
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,992
Oh. She's dead.

710
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,203
Of course she's dead. She fell.

711
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,539
That's right, she fell.

712
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,919
An accident. Happens all the time.

713
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,921
She was running and she fell. Into a rock.

714
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,840
Over and over again.
Okay, let's be real, she was attacked.

715
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,926
Someone attacked her.
But maybe they had a good reason, right?

716
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,511
You ever think of that, Detective?

717
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,637
Shit! Detectives are real

718
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,597
and DNA is a thing
and I just hit that girl with a rock.

719
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,724
God, the sound.
I would never hurt a woman.

720
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,311
But she was a dangerous,
flesh-hungry harpy.

721
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,022
She forced my hand.
That's on her and her family

722
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,399
for screwing her up.
I had to, Beck. I had to.

723
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,443
I knew you'd never forgive me,
but she gave me no choice.

724
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,363
I'm not a bad person.
She was going to ruin you.

725
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,573
But you're safe now. Thanks to me.

726
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,742
I just want you to live your best life.

727
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,910
It's brave, what I do for you.

728
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,329
It's not easy. It's hard.
Sometimes it makes me sick.

729
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,455
I'm brave.

730
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,124
How many guys will do anything
for the person they love?

731
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,252
Honestly, Beck. You're lucky to have me.

732
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,346
It's over. What's done is done,

733
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,932
and now there's nothing
standing between me and...

734
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,183
Paco.

735
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,936
Paco, what did you do?

736
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,064
I couldn't take another night.

737
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,567
I didn't know how many sleeping pills
would knock him out.

738
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,279
Beck, you asked me to help Paco,
but turns out you're gonna save him.

739
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,781
Because it's thanks to you
that I know exactly what to do.

740
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,117
We need towels.
Does your mom have any naloxone?

741
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,120
It would be in the bathroom cabinet.
A nasal spray. Fast.

742
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,205
-Do I call 911?
-Not if you want to see your mother again.

743
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,151
You freak. You little freak.

744
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:09,063
The universe has a funny way
of keeping us humble.

745
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,107
That beating was karmic. I know it.

746
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,069
I did a bad thing today.

747
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,780
But for a good reason.

748
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,074
And if there's any justice in the world...

749
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:25,245
you are the reward for all my suffering.

750
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,082
Hey, you.

751
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,793
Oh, Joe, thank God.

752
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,381
Peach was attacked in Central Park
in broad daylight.

753
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,257
I'm headed to the ER now.

754
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,177
She's alive?
