00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,073
My dad is a lot worse than I thought.
I went into his office.

5
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:36,244
And he has
all this insane conspiracy shit,

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,954
including you and Joe.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,456
We are a team.

00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,959
The best team.

than to overplay my hand.</i>

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,465
All right, so far, so good.
He's gonna meet me to talk.

<i>If I wasn't so in love with you, Marienne,</i>

00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>I might find this more upsetting,</i>

29
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:03,182
<i>but as it stands,
I have to play just jealous enough.</i>

30
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
You had to deploy your lace bra for that?

31
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,186
Yeah.

32
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,611
I know it's all a bit spooky, but...
It also kind of feels like no big deal.

33
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,323
<i>Is it just me
or doth the lady protest kind of a lot?</i>

34
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,910
The sooner we find out
what Matthew could have on us,

35
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,038
if anything,
the sooner we can fix it, right?

36
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>She might be more attracted to Theo
than she's willing to admit,</i>

37
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>but she's also right and distracted,</i>

38
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,463
<i>which is necessary to keep her
from Spidey-sensing you. Speaking of...</i>

39
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,050
Oh, the library fundraiser is coming up.

40
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,679
My boss asked me to stay late
the next couple of nights.

41
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,473
Uh, I would have said no.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,392
But I think that will make her
even more irritable than usual,

43
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,228
so I hope that's okay.

44
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,690
Yeah. I mean, of course. Should I...?
Should I put it in my calendar?

45
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>And have you both cross? No, no, no.</i>

46
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:59,113
It'll be pretty boring.
I wouldn't want to inflict that upon you.

47
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,451
How'd I end up
with such a thoughtful husband?

48
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
<i>This game is tricky.</i>

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
<i>Juggling you and Love won't be easy.</i>

50
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,918
<i>But if this is the game I have to play
to get closer to you, then game on.</i>

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>Though you haven't texted me back,
Marienne,</i>

52
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,225
<i>I know you felt what I felt in the rain.</i>

53
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,768
This seems elaborate.

54
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah, and <i>Alice in Wonderland,</i>
a story dear

55
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,692
to friends-of-the-library chairwoman
Sherry Conrad, which is fabulous...

56
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,736
<i>You feel it right now.
You're pretending you don't.</i>

57
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,656
And don't get me started
on how the friends of the library

58
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,992
only visit the library
when there's a gala.

59
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,869
<i>You're cautious about us,
which is smart.</i>

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,497
<i>But it means
I need to be a little bit bold.</i>

61
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,207
I thought about you all weekend.

62
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,835
Really?

63
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,918
Um...

64
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,093
'Cause I couldn't stop thinking
about those goats that faint

65
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,636
when they're startled.

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
You know, like, what the fuck, Darwin?

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,685
- I thought about you too. A lot.
<i>- I knew it.</i>

68
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,604
- But it can't happen again.
<i>- And here's the speech.</i>

69
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,066
Look, I gave it a lot of thought,
and for so many reasons,

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,403
- first and foremost being you're married...
- That's true.

71
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,114
But it's not that simple, I promise you.

72
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,617
I understand.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,538
<i>...that if I push too hard,
I risk losing you.</i>

74
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,956
Mommy.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey, no running, remember?

76
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,295
Ryan surprised me
by dropping her here this morning,

77
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,255
but she's having so much fun helping out.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,091
- Aren't you, <i>mon petit chou?
- I didn't think it was possible,</i>

79
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,094
<i>but in her presence,
you are even more exquisite.</i>

80
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,554
You must be Juliette.

81
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,805
Hmm?

82
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,809
- Look what Dante found for me.
- Oh.

83
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,730
Is that Hans Christian Andersen?
Let me guess. <i>Little Mermaid</i> fan.

84
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
Hey, Dante.

85
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,565
Hey.

86
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,648
Aw.

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,905
- Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
- Yeah. Someone was doing cartwheels.

88
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,951
Okay, we're going to have
to get these fixed before your dad sees.

89
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,328
I can cover for you.

90
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,332
Thanks, but my car is in the shop.

91
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,541
Let me take you.

92
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,752
Does he have to come?

93
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,921
<i>Ouch. What'd I do to her?</i>

94
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,674
Sorry. Yes, that would be great.

95
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,885
Thank you.

96
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,471
Hey. I'll get back to it.

97
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,431
- Hey.
- Mom still hasn't shown up

98
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,891
and she won't answer my calls.

99
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
Isn't today the meeting
to finalize her divorce?

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,355
Yeah, three hours ago. I mean, she flaked.

101
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,315
Classic Dottie.

102
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,193
<i>Any chance you could watch Henry?</i>

103
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,986
<i>Me, you and our kids,</i>

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>it's not exactly the quality time
I had in mind today,</i>

105
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,242
<i>but what would the perfect husband do?</i>

106
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,244
Sure. I'll be there soon.

107
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,540
Okay. Thanks.

108
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,544
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to pop by like this,

109
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,505
- but I just heard something terrible.
- What?

110
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,135
My caterer, for the library fundraiser,
got frostbite.

111
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,928
- Too much infrared sauna.
- Oh, my God.

112
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,182
So she's out.
Then I realized, you could fill in.

113
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,266
Oh.

114
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,521
I mean, that's really flattering,

115
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,023
but I haven't catered in a long time.

116
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,818
Don't be silly.
I'm sure it's like riding a Peloton.

117
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,403
I have to develop a menu.

118
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,656
- I'd have to hire people.
- I will handle staff and logistics.

119
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,533
You do the food,

120
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,870
collect the compliments,
get exposure for your business.

121
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,955
Don't make me beg.

122
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,129
- Okay.
- Mm! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

123
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,798
Mm...

124
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,051
- What?
- You have a glow about you

125
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,012
and I noticed it on game night too.

126
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,138
Yeah, I mean...

127
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
I took your advice.

128
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,727
- About choosing your soul mate.
- Mm.

129
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,730
Joe has been so attentive lately.

130
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,858
I love that. And the sex life?

131
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,860
Back on track, I assume?

132
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,822
No. I don't mean to pry.

133
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,949
No, Joe's just been really busy with work.

134
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,368
No judgment. Have you seen the studies

135
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,538
on how quickly
our sex parts get bored of each other?

136
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,043
But, you know,
it doesn't have to be an issue.

137
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,129
You are so hot, Love.

138
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
- Just hack your sex life.
- Like...

139
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,759
with supplements?

140
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,472
A lot of ways to increase Joe's libido.

141
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,518
Tap into his fantasies,
really make him feel like a man.

142
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,730
It's what I've done with Cary,
and my vagina has never been happier.

143
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,566
Look, I'll send you a post
I wrote about it.

144
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,528
Along with an RSVP list of the guests

145
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,238
- with food allergies.
- Okay.

146
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,822
Thanks again.

147
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,575
Whoo!

148
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,920
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry. Sorry. I know, I'm early.

149
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,422
- Yeah. Thank you for meeting me.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,593
Oh, that's...
That's not why I asked you here.

151
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,677
Okay.

152
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,597
Um...

153
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:22,061
Sorry, I feel like there's mixed signals,
'cause, like, first, we have sex.

154
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
- Can you...?
- It's all right. And then you know...

155
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
You say that it can't happen again,

156
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,697
and then you're, like,
stripping at your window,

157
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,074
asking me to meet in secret.

158
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,367
Yeah, you're right.

159
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,496
You're right. I'm a mess.

160
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,375
I guess this is what happens
when your parents get divorced

161
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,961
and you see how easily
your own marriage can fall apart.

162
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,880
- Are you and Joe...?
- Oh, no, no, no.

163
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,674
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Hey.

164
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,593
You're not alone.

165
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,845
Honestly, like,

166
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,097
we're friends.

167
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,476
I'm your friend, if you need anything.

168
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,813
Okay.

169
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,774
I mean...

170
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,405
- if you really wanna help...
- Mm-hm?

171
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,283
Could you find out
what your dad has on me and Joe?

172
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,203
What...? What do you mean?
What does he have?

173
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,247
- I don't know. That's the thing.
- Okay.

174
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,750
Then... Then why?

175
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,877
I... I mean...

176
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,214
We've talked about this.
My family's in the public eye.

177
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,343
My parents are chopping off
each other's heads in this divorce.

178
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,013
- It shouldn't make my family interesting...
- If it's not like a literal crime,

179
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,309
- he's not gonna show anyone.
- But this is a major trigger for me.

180
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,812
I can't help but worry
when people have information on my family.

181
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,027
- I know it's not rational...
- It doesn't have to be.

182
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
I get it. I do.

183
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,408
People are fucking vampires.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,869
You know, that can scar you for sure.

185
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,037
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

186
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,789
Yeah.

187
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,041
You get it.

188
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,592
Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, you know,
I'll sneak into his office.

189
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,928
See what I can find.

190
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,391
Thank you.

191
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,274
What's your favorite fairy tale?

192
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,235
- Jack and the Beanstalk.
- No.

193
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,530
Yes. Hell, yes. Jack was a little badass.

194
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,700
I wanted to be him. Screw princesses.
I know I wanted to...

195
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:51,710
<i>How do I make you see
I could be your happily ever after?</i>

196
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,592
Hey, can I say something?
And you don't have to say anything back.

197
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,764
It's been a long time
since I have felt this happy.

198
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,809
This feels so easy.
So I just wanna say thank you.

199
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,312
Can we go back to the library?

200
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,818
Baby, your glasses aren't ready yet.

201
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,863
You wanna play a game?
We can play "I Spy."

202
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,946
Okay.

203
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,367
Uh, I spy with my little eye...

204
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,080
something that begins with the letter M.

205
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,416
- It's Mommy.
- Yeah.

206
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,377
Good job, baby.

207
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:39,383
<i>You're thinking what I am.
Is this the family we were destined for?</i>

208
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,056
What's wrong?

209
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,351
Um, it's... It's Ryan.

210
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,687
He's giving me a heads-up

211
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,399
that Channel Three is making
a sizable donation to the library

212
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,652
and he will be at the fundraiser
to present the check.

213
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,322
You don't think it's a coincidence?

214
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,450
No, I mean, he's furious
that I'm reopening custody.

215
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,160
It's a power move.

216
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,746
He wants to show me
he can hurt me, even at my job.

217
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,500
Do you think he's watching us?

218
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,085
He feels ownership over me, okay?

219
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,505
Sick as it is. And you stood up to him.

220
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,049
So he's never gonna let that slide.

221
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,552
So this, you and me, we can't.

222
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,598
If Ryan finds out that I was
with a married man, however innocently,

223
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,060
he'll use it and I'll never get custody.

224
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>You're right. Ryan is a problem,</i>

225
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>but there are always problems
in love stories.</i>

226
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,526
<i>I'll find a way to solve this one,
for you.</i>

227
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,699
One time, I needed a fix so badly

228
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,662
that I broke my molar
with a pair of pliers,

229
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,164
knowing that they'd give me Oxy for it.

230
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,544
That's where this disease took me.

231
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,881
I couldn't wake up without Adderall.
I couldn't go to sleep without Oxy.

232
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,216
<i>Interesting.</i>

233
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>Let me tell you what I've learned
about your ex, Ryan Goodwin.</i>

234
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,181
<i>He's not a morning person.</i>

235
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,474
<i>He wears tighty-whities.</i>

236
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,561
<i>He's obsessed with protein shakes
and his workout regimen.</i>

237
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,731
<i>It's like he's training
for the asshole Olympics.</i>

238
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,733
<i>His mom, Harriet Goodwin,</i>

239
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>who's also his private chef,
maid and nanny, by the looks of it.</i>

240
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>It's not okay, Marienne.</i>

241
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,576
<i>He's gaslit his way to full custody,</i>

242
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>when he doesn't even give
your daughter the time of day.</i>

243
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,124
<i>He leaves Juliette to his mom</i>

244
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,460
<i>while he works out with Wes,
his "best friend."</i>

245
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,505
<i>Wes makes Ryan feel superior.
So that tracks.</i>

246
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,635
<i>Ryan is technically sober.
But he's an emotional powder keg.</i>

247
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,096
<i>He's transferred
his addiction to drugs and alcohol</i>

248
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,515
<i>to an addiction to his body and status.</i>

249
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
<i>Ryan's sobriety is hanging by a thread.</i>

250
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,187
<i>You put a pebble into the machine
and wait for it to fail.</i>

251
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,237
<i>Fuck. How many shakes does one man need?</i>

252
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,958
Grandma's home.

253
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,210
Where have you...?

254
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,506
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,428
Especially after how royally
your father fucked me in the arbitration,

256
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,640
considering that I'm sober as a saint.

257
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,686
One would expect the prenup
to fuck me out of Anavrin,

258
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,105
despite the fact that I created it.

259
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,108
It's the part where he found a way
to get around my lawyer

260
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,780
and take my second-act vineyard,
my second act, for spite.

261
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,281
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,700
Sorry doesn't even cover it, Love.

263
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,037
I did everything I was supposed to do.

264
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,416
This is what happens
when you marry the wrong man.

265
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,213
- Do you disagree?
- About Dad?

266
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,008
No, he treated you horribly.
That's why I don't speak to him anymore.

267
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,595
Then why are you being so quiet?

268
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,972
I feel...

269
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,101
sad.

270
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,437
I know it's the right thing.
I'm glad that it's over.

271
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:25,401
But it feels like a...
Like a kind of loss.

272
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,570
You're right and it's sad.

273
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,366
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

274
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,076
That's not what I'm saying.

275
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,745
No, I should have known
the marriage was over two years in

276
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,039
when your father stopped
wanting to do anal.

277
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,833
I don't need the details.

278
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,252
Don't be such a prude.
I'm doing you a service.

279
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,045
You need to know what to look out for

280
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,090
- in your own marriage.
- My marriage is nothing like yours.

281
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,426
So you're not sleeping
with the neighbor's son?

282
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm not discussing this with you.

283
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,263
Mom!

284
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,098
It's enough.

285
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,689
Where are you going?

286
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,107
Shit.

287
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,942
I am calling a Lyft.

288
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,447
Excuse me for hoping
my daughter would lend a sympathetic ear.

289
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,684
Knock, knock.

290
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:46,106
Mm. Leez. Hi. Come on in.
Please. How long has it been?

291
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,359
- Gosh, couple years, right?
- Yeah, couple of years. That's right.

292
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,489
Thanks, Theo. I'm hearing great things
about your work on the corporate side.

293
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,742
The team loves you. You've come
a long way from the cocky, young coder

294
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,204
- who hacked my e-mail.
- My asshole days are far behind me.

295
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:05,459
Here's the thing. Not too far, I hope.
I need your help with something. Please.

296
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,306
This looks...

297
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,684
like a lot of security camera footage.

298
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,605
Yes. It is. It's every perimeter camera
and doorbell cam in Madre Linda.

299
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,358
Live feeds and cloud archives,
there's all of it.

300
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
Not gonna ask how you got it,

301
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,822
but what do you need me for
if you already have access to these?

302
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,281
I need you to help me sort it.

303
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,784
I'm drowning in footage
from a million cameras.

304
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,246
I need the ability to look
at particular people on particular dates.

305
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,207
- You want my facial-recognition algorithm.
- I do.

306
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,669
I had a scary meeting
with the FBI after that one.

307
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,587
No, no, no. They'll never know.

308
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,006
What you want will take a long time.

309
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh, I don't think it will,
not if you're involved.

310
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,887
And I'm prepared to dramatically overpay.

311
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,056
Plus, you'd be doing a service
to the world.

312
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,391
How so?

313
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,767
Finding a murderer.

314
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,530
So you're Cary's friend?

315
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
Yeah, I'm sorry, how old are you?

316
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,744
I don't need to define myself
by something so arbitrary as a number.

317
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,997
Okay.

318
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,999
Don't worry, this isn't a sting.

319
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,170
So, FYI, I do this as a service,
someone's gonna deal,

320
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,380
so I serve as a means
of medicating the public,

321
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,091
protecting communities
likely to be profiled by the police.

322
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,135
I donate all my proceeds to NAMI.

323
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,221
The National Alliance on Mental Illness.

324
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,850
<i>I'm beginning to think
this generation may just save us all.</i>

325
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,478
That'll be $1,237.37.

326
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,024
I only take Bitcoin.

327
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,485
<i>The lengths I will go to for you,
Marienne...</i>

328
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,534
<i>including sneaking in while Ryan's at work
and Juliette and Grandma are at ballet.</i>

329
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,922
<i>I hope Ryan enjoys his new shake recipe.</i>

330
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,049
<i>Adderall in the morning
and Oxycontin at night</i>

331
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,593
<i>to reintroduce small amounts
into his system.</i>

332
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,138
<i>All in an effort to fire
his neurotransmitters</i>

333
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,892
<i>that are predisposed towards addiction,
thus inciting the phenomenon of craving.</i>

334
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,395
<i>If the combo of cravings
and emotional dysregulation</i>

335
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,939
<i>don't trigger a relapse,</i>

336
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,651
<i>then disrupting his morning routine will.</i>

337
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,737
<i>He'll be off the beam
by your next custody hearing.</i>

338
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,660
<i>And we can thank my son's toys for that
never-ending supply of drained batteries.</i>

339
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,123
<i>I should go but not before I unearth more
about my nemesis.</i>

340
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,546
<i>Does this man own a book not written
by Tim Ferriss or Tony Robbins?</i>

341
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,507
<i>What's this?</i>

342
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,187
<i>It hurts me to leave these here.</i>

343
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,608
<i>He doesn't deserve any part of you,
but it's temporary, Marienne.</i>

344
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,360
<i>I'm gonna fix it for you.</i>

345
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,444
<i>Fix him.</i>

<i>♪ Freak like me ♪</i>

<i>♪ You want a good girl
That does bad things... ♪</i>

348
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,961
<i>What happened to my wife?
Am I in trouble?</i>

349
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,046
You look nice.

350
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,423
How was your day?

351
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,300
<i>She smells like The Body Shop.</i>

352
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,759
- It was good.
- Yeah?

353
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,470
Yeah. What's going on?
Planning to cook for an army?

354
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,847
Um...

355
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
Sort of?

356
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,685
The caterer for the library fundraiser
dropped out.

357
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,897
So Sherry asked me if I would pitch in.

358
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,107
That's amazing.

359
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,234
<i>You and my wife in the same place.</i>

360
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,111
I've got six people at the bakery

361
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,406
setting up this insane stove situation.
I'm gonna be up all night.

362
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,200
I know your boss is picky,
so I hope I'll make her happy.

363
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,785
I'm sure you will.

364
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:22,007
I just wanted to make sure
that I made you a nice dinner first.

365
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,507
Okay.

366
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,219
<i>Something is up with her.</i>

367
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,306
<i>Did she kill someone else
and she's trying to distract me?</i>

368
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,640
I have a little less time.

369
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,728
- Okay.
- A little you time, actually.

370
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,738
<i>Oh, no.</i>

371
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,496
<i>This isn't happening.</i>

372
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,377
<i>Shit! I have nothing left.</i>

373
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,049
<i>After you.</i>

374
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,844
- Just maybe not right this second.
- Oh.

375
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,138
- Just maybe not...
- God. I'm sorry.

376
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,558
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- I've had a long day.

377
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,352
- It was a good idea.
- Yeah, of course.

378
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,688
I don't know why I'm trying to blow you
the second you walk in the door,

379
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,772
that's silly.

380
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>I did not anticipate this.</i>

381
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:27,155

388
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,844
Well, you gotta be shitting me.

389

00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,604
Fuck!

393
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,148
Fuck!

394
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,570
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
I was coming by to update you,

395
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,531
and then I heard screaming, so I entered.

396
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,367
I just burned a bunch of fucking almonds.

397
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,079
I've got, like, 500 other things
I need to do right now. So...

398
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,247
Okay.

399
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,668
So then it's not a good time
to tell you that I couldn't figure out

400
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,628
what my dad has on you and Joe.

401
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,629
Yet, yet.

402
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,547
It's fine.

403
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,464
I will.

404
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,717
Also, while I'm being honest,

405
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,678
it's really hard to stand here
and have a conversation with you,

406
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,265
as though I'm not totally distracted
by how much I want you.

407
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Okay.

408
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,108
All right, let's forget
that I said anything.

409
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Oh.

410
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,367
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just...

411
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,788
Was it the dad thing
or the hitting on you?

412
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,872
I don't...

413
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,045
I don't know
what the fuck is wrong with me.

414
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,128
Hey.

415
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,298
No, I used to have my shit together.

416
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,050
Hey. Hey, stop it.

417
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,260
Don't be stupid, okay?

418
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,976
Are you sure? Oh, okay.

419
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,439
Oh, fuck.

420
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,446
<i>He called his shithead buddy

<i>Hopefully he won't be too helpful.</i>

422
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,617
Brutal, man. Brutal.

423
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,036
Yeah.

424
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,499
<i>And just like that, Ryan Goodwin

I'm calling in sick so we can get blasted.

<i>You're welcome, Marienne.</i>

428
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,408
You like it?

429
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,702
No.

430
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,538
I love it. It's been sold out everywhere.

431
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,333
It was my feeble attempt at an apology
for last night's misfire.

432
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,046
I know that I've been off 'cause of work.
I've been distracted and I'm sorry.

433
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,508
- I should be saying I'm sorry.
- Wait. There's more. Just open it.

434
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,683
Oh, my... Where the fuck
did you get Donut Pal?

435
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,020
It's the magic of my love for you.
No, they opened in Berkeley.

436
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,939
So I paid a kid to stand in line
and courier them over here.

437
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,734
The look on your face
when you bite into one of those...

438
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,570
Doughnuts aren't objectively sexy,

439
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,323
but you make them
the hottest thing on Earth.

440
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,289
Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

441
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,372
I...

442
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,713
I thought
you didn't find me attractive anymore.

443
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,342
<i>Fuck. I've been so single-minded
in my pursuit of you.</i>

444
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,930
<i>Tonight my focus will be on Love.</i>

445
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,850
<i>It has to be,
because if Love is not happy,</i>

446
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,602
<i>we will never get the chance to be.</i>

447
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,895
You know, I...

448
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,317
My mom was just in my head.
Their marriage was so toxic.

449
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,653
Yeah. No, I guess, it's understandable.

450
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,072
But we are not them.

451
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,784
Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,624
Oh, this is her.

453
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,085
Um, I should get this.

454
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,753
- You should go get changed.
- Yeah.

455
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,212
Okay.

456
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,302
- Hey, hey, Mom.
<i>- I know I'm late.</i>

457
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,932
<i>I just took a little siesta and forgot
to set an alarm. I'll be there soon.</i>

458
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,184
What are you talking about?

459
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,062
Don't you need me to watch Forty
while you're at the fundraiser?

460
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,190
Oh. No, we got a sitter.
You just take care of you.

461
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,735
So now I'm not good enough
to watch Forty? Is that it?

462
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,445
- Have you been drinking?
- What?

463
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,198
- I need to see Forty.
- You're drunk.

464
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,658
I am not.

465
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,202
You're just mad at me
for bringing up the neighbor boy.

466
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,871
- Okay. I have to go.
- You're keeping my baby from me.

467
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,998
- Don't drive.
- Please let me see Forty.

468
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,627
- I can't deal with you right now.
- He's all I have left.

469
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,797
Little bitch!

470
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,134
Little bitch.

471
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,227
Sweetie, can you help me
set this table up?

472
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,562
No mat.

473
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,814
<i>When the guests arrive,
it'll be packed in here.</i>

474
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,525
<i>That'll keep you
and Love apart, right? Shit.</i>

475
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,486
<i>Love is not stupid. This could be bad.
Why did I agree to this?</i>

476
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,572
<i>Okay. Okay, I need a plan.</i>

477
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,366
<i>I need to keep Love
as preoccupied as possible.</i>

478
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,284
Great. Bye.

479
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,245
<i>Gotta hand it to you, Marienne,
you have outdone yourself.</i>

480
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,875
You think I should just check in on them?

481
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,461
I'm just being neurotic, actually.

482
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,130
<i>Always. But is it too much
to hope she stays back there</i>

483
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,257
<i>- and you two never meet?</i>
- Whatever you think.

484
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,554
<i>There you are.</i>

485
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,889
<i>Undeniably you.</i>

486
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:31,144
<i>Original, haunting, real,
never mind Alice and the Queen.</i>

487
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,813
<i>You're the red rose herself.</i>

488
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,733
Yeah, I'm just being neurotic.
Thank you so much.

489
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,284
I was looking for you.

490
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,786
- Big problem.
- Yeah.

491
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,872
I forgot to note everyone's
food intolerances on the seating chart.

492
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,624
- Can you...?
- Yeah, of course.

493
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,708
Okay. Um...

494
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,502
You, come!

495
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,212
- We can do this fast.
- Okay.

496
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,176
<i>And just like that,
our fairy tale turns dark.</i>

497
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,303
<i>I should make a disaster
in the kitchen truck,</i>

498
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,432
<i>turn up the oven, scorch the quail,
but it's too late.</i>

499
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,314
<i>It's like I'm watching my own execution.</i>

500
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,482
My man!

501
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,904
- Things work out with Taschen?
- It was great. Yeah. Thank you.

502
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,240
<i>Better than great, actually,
no sign of Ryan means</i>

503
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,034
<i>he's probably in hour eight
of a drug binge with his buddy.</i>

504
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,954
Baby, baby.

505
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,003
I'm sorry, you must be Love. I'm Marienne.

506
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,755
Joe's told me so much about you.

507
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,382
- You're Joe's boss?
- Mm-hm.

508
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,677
- It's so great to meet you.
- You as well.

509
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,682
He's probably told you
how much of a taskmaster I am.

510
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,308
No, I wouldn't say that.

511
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,853
It's true. I do have exacting standards,

512
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,022
which is probably a euphemism
for being a bossy pain in the ass.

513
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,691
No, no, he really...

514
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,360
He really loves working here.

515
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,154
Good.

516
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,031
Even if there's late shifts.

517
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,159
Yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a gem.

518
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:14,372
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up and...

519
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,164
I'm, um...

520
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,626
I'm seeing someone.

521
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,754
We're in that "hang out
as much as possible" phase,

522
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,923
so Joe's been picking up my slack.

523
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,551
- Really?
- Yeah.

524
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,013
That's so sweet.
Yeah, no, he doesn't seem to mind at all.

525
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,223
Oh, that's very good to know.

526
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,769
<i>Whatever you're saying
seems to be working for now.</i>

527
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,567
Hey, hey, heads up.
Fifty grand coming through.

528
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,404
<i>What the fuck?
He should be out of his mind.</i>

529
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,323
<i>How is he even standing right now?</i>

530
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,866
Here we go.

531
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,993
- Not a fan?
- He's my ex.

532
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,664
Hello. You both look lovely.
What should I do with this?

533
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,751
Don't want it out
before the big unveiling.

534
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,294
Let me show you.

535
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,129
Excuse us.

536
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,343
Hey, Dante.

537
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,264
That guy is the fucking worst.

538
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,350
<i>Oh, Dante,
one cannot even begin to fathom.</i>

539
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,145
He seems smug, I suppose.
But recovery can't be easy.

540
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,773
Recovery? That prick's never been sober.

541
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,320
His AA stuff is all for show.
There's drugs in his protein shake.

542
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,113
- Like, today?
- Always.

543
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,493
I took a sip on accident once.
I got so tweaked, I couldn't sleep.

544
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,121
And then I realized,
he pounds that stuff all day. Every day.

545
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,790
<i>I have been played.</i>

546
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
<i>I couldn't dose Ryan</i>

547
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,962
<i>because he's been dosing himself
the whole time</i>

548
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,798
<i>and his tolerance is through the roof.
How did I miss this?</i>

549
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,342
Dante! How's it hanging, buddy?

550
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,679
So much better now that you're here.
Will you excuse me?

551
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,600
Joe Goldberg, right? I'm Ryan Goodwin.

552
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,354
We met the other night
when I wasn't being my best self.

553
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,856
That's right. It's good to re-meet you.

554
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,775
<i>You fucking cockroach.</i>

555
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,694
Oh! Fuck!

556
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,738
That's meat. Where are you from?

557
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,198
- New York.
- The city?

558
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,783
Brooklyn.

559
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,035
- How's the wine?
- It's okay, I guess.

560
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,414
You know, it's interesting.

561
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,167
I've seen you,
lurking in the back of meetings,

562
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,752
pretending like you're invisible.

563
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,796
But given the way
you're nursing that drink,

564
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,799
you don't strike me as someone
who has a drinking problem.

565
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,801
<i>Fuck, how much of me did he see?</i>

566
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,094
You gotta try this.

567
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,015
It is, like, Iberian or some shit.
Yeah, give it a taste. Come on.

568
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,850
Come on, taste.

569
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,146
<i>What is this?
A sociopath's power play?</i>

570
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:52,238
I don't know what you're up to,
but I bet my dick, it's about Marienne.

571
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
Stay away from her.

572
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,079
Enjoy the party.

573
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>I lost this round,
but this isn't over.</i>

574
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,211
<i>Not when you are at stake.</i>

575
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:17,096
This looks amazing. Unh!

576
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,683
I am so good.

577
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
Unh. I knew you'd do me right.

578
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,062
Thanks.

579
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,651
I can't wait any longer. This is torture.

580
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,237
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

581
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,114
What?

582
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,950
Didn't you read the post I sent you?

583
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,995
Yeah, that really spun me out, Sherry.

584
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,040
The biological importance
of making your man feel like a man?

585
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,249
I...

586
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,212
I just don't think
I'm one of these hot wives.

587
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,295
Oh.

588
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,634
You should've kept reading.

589
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,843
Okay...

590
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,599
Hot Wife is a term...

591
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,809
Right.

592
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:07,271
...for women in open marriages.

593
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,193
Like me. Cary and I are polyamorous.

594
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,614
Love, please, tell me you got the part
where I sent you a post I wrote.

595
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,409
As in, that's my secret sex blog.

596
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,288
Oh, I do not think
that I picked up on that.

597
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,959
Well, now you know.

598
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,047
And the more time
we spend with you and Joe,

599
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:38,344
well, we can't stop thinking
about the two of you.

600
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,144
We would love...

601
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:55,236
to take our relationship to a new level.

602
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,078
Would you be game?

603
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,461
Oh.

604
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,964
Sorry, it's my babysitter.

605
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,508
What the fuck?

606
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,894
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,739
Let's hang up on your mother.

608
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,616
We don't need to speak to her.

609
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,285
Thank you.

610
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,955
Stephanie, what a pretty name.

611
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,251
Oh, don't worry, he's not a baby.

612
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,797
No, no, he's the reincarnation
of my son, Forty,

613
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,674
and he loves a good taco.

614
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,343
Don't you, baby? Yes.

615
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,013
My daughter's trying to keep him from me.
She's selfish like her father.

616
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,182
I think we're missing
a couple of "gordatas."

617
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,266
Uh...

618
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,394
- They're coming right out.
- Bless you, Persephone.

619
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,273
- You're a good person, aren't you?
- I guess.

620
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,153
I just want Love to understand
where I'm coming from,

621
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,489
but she refuses to listen.

622
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,283
No one will listen.

623
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,869
Except you.

624
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,207
I'm getting my gordatas.

625
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,917
Chrissake.

626
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,919
No, I need my power back.

627
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,839
I need justice. I need karmic retribution.

628
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,553
- Do you want hot sauce?
- I want all the hot sauce and a lighter.

629
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,430
Excuse me?

630
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,307
I'll give you...

631
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,727
300 dollars for a lighter.

632
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,491
Thank you for listening.

633
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
Let's go.

634
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,511
Oh, yeah.

635
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,056
The bastard wanted the vineyard.

636
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,479
Oh, oh!

637
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.

638
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,947
<i>Note to self,
if you take a baby on a drunk joyride</i>

639
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,117
<i>to go burn down a vineyard,
make sure you're a rich, white lady</i>

640
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,786
<i>whose lawyer can get you
in a fancy rehab instead of jail.</i>

641
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,165
- Thank you for...
- What the fuck were you thinking?

642
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,209
Just put him to bed, okay? I've got this.

643
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,435
You can sleep here tonight.

644
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,146
Tomorrow, Joe will drive you to rehab.

645
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,273
You'll never see me.

646
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,194
And you will never see Henry ever again.

647
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,864
- You don't mean that.
- I do. With every fiber of my being.

648
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,659
Love, please. I made a mistake.
But I've been punished...

649
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,495
You could have killed him!

650
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,582
You had your family...

651
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,251
and look what you did.

652
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,672
You let your husband destroy
your self-worth.

653
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,469
You neglected your children.
You didn't protect Forty. I did that.

654
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,762
Oh, that's rich.

655
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,598
You liked him broken

656
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,850
- 'cause it gave you purpose.
- Maybe.

657
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,064
But I have a new purpose now
and that's protecting my family.

658
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,276
- From you.
- How can you say that? I'm your mother.

659
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,407
Having no mother would be better.

660
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,500
You think you're so much better than me?
You're just me 20 years ago.

661
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,295
One day, you will lose everything too.

662
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,006
And then you'll see
how cruel you really are.

663
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,642
Oh. Hey.

664
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,520
Did you get it done? Whatever it is.

665
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,605
Yep, just finished up.

666
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,442
So, what were you doing?

667
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,154
He totally passed out.
Think he really needs some rest.

668
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:58,664
Look, it's none of my business,
but your dad is not okay.

669
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,917
He needs help.

670
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,420
I'll let myself out.

671
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:09,735
<i>I should be in bed with you,
tracing and drawing on your arm.</i>

672
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:14,949
<i>Instead, I'm driving an Uber
shuttling Medusa-in-law to rehab.</i>

673
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,577
Bet you're happy
you won't have to see me anymore.

674
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,415
I always thought
we had a good relationship.

675
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,464
I have something to tell you, Joe.

676
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,053
I see how hard you're trying
to make your marriage work, just like me.

677
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,931
I did everything
to keep my family together,

678
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,101
including lying to myself
about who my husband was...

679
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,144
and who my daughter is.

680
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,398
<i>Is this where Dottie tries
to poison me against Love?</i>

681
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,233
<i>Her final act of revenge?</i>

682
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,777
How much do you know
about Love's first husband, James?

683
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,028
Um...

684
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,284
I know they were in love. Married young.

685
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,328
He got cancer and then he died.

686
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,289
Not quite.

687
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,835
When James became ill,
he and Love were already having problems.

688
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,337
After he went into remission,

689
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,797
he asked for a divorce.

690
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,342
And the next thing you know, he was dead.

691
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,344
<i>Surely, she's not suggesting...</i>

692
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,764
I have no proof, of course.
Just a mother's intuition.

693
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,392
You probably think I'm crazy.

694
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:28,355
<i>I might, if I hadn't seen
what Love is capable of, many times.</i>

695
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,940
This must be hard.

696
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,775
You're loyal.

697
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,111
That's what makes you a good husband.

698
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,408
But Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

699
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,788
If anything were to happen to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

700
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,589
Like a young Gregory Peck.

701
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,052
<i>Could Love have killed her first husband?</i>

702
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,349
<i>I've been so worried about her hurting you
that I failed to remember:</i>

703
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,309
<i>I am also fair game.</i>

704
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,533
<i>But we should be together, Marienne.
I will find a way.</i>

705
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,663
<i>It's risky, but love requires
a hint of madness.</i>

706
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
<i>We're all mad here, right, red rose?</i>

707
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,917
- Hey.
- Hey.

708
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,877
- Is everything okay?
- No.

709
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,804
Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

710
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,806
He's threatening to use it against me.

711
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,517
What? We're just colleagues.

712
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,061
We're not. And you know that.

713
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,938
And besides, it doesn't matter

714
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,941
because Ryan will make it look
as bad as possible.

715
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,777
<i>Fucking Ryan. I'll destroy him.</i>

716
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,612
- We can fix this.
- We?

717
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,157
What are you talking about?
You're married.

718
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,869
Your marriage doesn't seem strained.
Your wife is lovely.

719
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,623
<i>Lovely, yes. With a mild habit
of murdering women I care about.</i>

720
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,000
I hated having to lie to her.

721
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,171
I slid into old patterns
and I feel disgusted.

722
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,255
I...

723
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,883
It's not good for my recovery.

724
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,929
I'm at a point where I'm supposed to live
with integrity. I can't be a home-wrecker.

725
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,056
Of course not.

726
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,226
But there has to be another way.

727
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,352
There isn't.

728
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,438
Hey.

729
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,859
I care about you. I do.

730
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,779
And, yeah, there's chemistry.

731
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,697
<i>But...</i>

732
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,991
But, no, I have to think of Juliette.

733
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,619
And I promised myself,
my next relationship would be...

734
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,706
Would be aboveboard and honest.

735
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,167
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,798
<i>Aboveboard and honest.</i>

737
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,842
<i>How do I give that to you?</i>

738
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,768
You good?

739
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,189
Yeah, yeah, I'm just... I'm tired.

740
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,650
Can I get your opinion on something?

741
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,734
Yeah, of course.

742
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,365
- What do you think about this?
- What is this?

743
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,244
Sherry sent it.
It's from her secret sex blog.

744
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,581
- Sherry and Cary are in an open marriage.
- Hmm.

745
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,377
And... they wanna sleep with us.

746
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,426
Yeah, I thought it was a joke too.

747
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,179
So...? So why are you showing me this?

748
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,809
As a joke, obviously.

749
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,893
Oh.

750
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,148
You don't really look at me the same.

751
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,484
You don't seem interested
in having sex with me.

752
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,945
That's not true.
People go through rough patches.

753
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,613
I don't wanna become...

754
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
like my parents.

755
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,370
They couldn't stay in love.

756
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,498
Maybe we need to shake things up.

757
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,585
It sounds crazy, but I read that article.

758
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,795
<i>Opening our marriage.</i>

759
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,880
<i>This loophole cannot be falling
into my lap.</i>

760
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,341
I don't even know how I feel about it.

761
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,220
Sherry just said it was the greatest hack,

762
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,014
and I guess...

763
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,851
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

764
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,937
<i>I'd rather take
a chain saw to my thigh,</i>

765
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,438
<i>but hopefully, that's negotiable.</i>

766
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,440
Sorry, I'm just being stupid.

767
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,235
Love, Love, stop, stop, stop backpedaling.

768
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,822
You can come to me with anything.

769
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,575
That's what this marriage is, right?

770
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,121
No idea is too crazy?
We talk things through, right?

771
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,583
And we make decisions together.

772
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,171
I love you.

773
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,971
<i>And I love you.</i>
