5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>I'm an optimist.</i>

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,872
<i>And that, Love, is why I'm gonna say,</i>

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>"I can't wait
to tell our story to our kids."</i>

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>I know, it's hardly begun,</i>

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>but it's how I've always been.</i>

10
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>Even as a kid, one glance from a girl</i>

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>and I was trying out
my last name with hers.</i>

12
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>I don't think that's wrong.</i>

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>I think love should come out of nowhere,
sweep you up completely.</i>

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>But let's not conflate optimism
with certitude.</i>

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>I've learned some hard lessons,</i>

16
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>fools do rush in.</i>

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>And I've been the fool more than once.</i>

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>If I'm honest, I saw red flags</i>

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
<i>and explained them away.</i>
