1
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,475
<i>Love,</i>

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>this is why you're not for me.</i>

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,816
<i>Once upon a time, I believed in love.</i>

4
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>Sure, I'd been hurt before,
but I'd learned from that,</i>

5
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,822
<i>and I wanted to fight for a fresh start.</i>

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>The real thing this time.</i>

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>So, boy meets girl,</i>

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>boy knows this is a something special,
and he thinks,</i>

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>"Let me do everything I can
to make this right."</i>

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>So, I did.</i>

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,090
<i>I was brave.</i>

12
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>I was vulnerable.</i>

13
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,428
<i>I won her the old-fashioned way.</i>

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>I tried to do everything right</i>

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>for her.</i>

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>I knew you have to do anything for love.</i>

17
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,354
<i>So I did.</i>

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>I did whatever I had to,</i>

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>whatever it took.</i>

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,737
I love you, Joe.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,238
I love you too.

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,783
I heard about you and Candace.

23
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,923
You know, I thought we were pretty happy,

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,703
but she thought she could
be happier with...

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,747
some guy in Rome, so...

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,541
It's just how she left so suddenly...

27
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>But she did not trust me.</i>

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>So she started asking questions
about the past.</i>

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>Candace?</i>

30
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,259
I think they dated.

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,053
Oh, they did.

32
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,722
<i>But I can't say I was shocked
when it didn't work out.</i>

33
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,057
Who's Elijah?

34
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,518
Give me my phone, Joe.

35
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,481
- <i>He's not your brother, I know that.
- I don't love you.</i>

36
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,562
I never have.

37
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>She started digging for stuff
that should have stayed buried.</i>

38
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>I picked wrong.</i>

39
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,241
<i>I made mistakes.</i>

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,120
<i>Love had made me blind.</i>

41
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>Joe!</i>

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,996
<i>And now...</i>

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,956
Joe!

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,582
<i>...love turned to poison.</i>

45
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,042
<i>Tell me I'm crazy.</i>

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,378
Tell me you didn't...

47
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,922
kill Peach.

48
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,385
Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

49
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>And when love dies, it really hurts.</i>

50
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,517
<i>The bottom line is...</i>

51
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>she couldn't love me back.</i>

52
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>And our love died.</i>

53
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>I thought that was the end.</i>

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>A sad story.</i>

55
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,034
<i>A broken heart I'd have to heal from
to love again.</i>

56
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,414
<i>But no, there was more hurt in store.</i>

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,169
Candace.

58
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,172
I think we have some unfinished business
to talk about.

59
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,006
Yeah.

60
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,885
<i>And so I realize this is what I get</i>

61
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>for trying so hard.</i>

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,971
<i>I can't love again.</i>

63
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>I can't risk it. It's too dangerous.</i>

64
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,394
<i>The only fresh start is a start</i>

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,854
<i>without love.</i>

66
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,855
Cut!

67
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,900
We're gonna go again from the top.
Quickly.

68
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,775
Nice.

69
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,404
Print that.
We're gonna go again from the top.

70
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,779
<i>This...</i>

71
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
<i>is what it's come to.</i>

72
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,955
<i>♪ I'm a troubled man ♪</i>

73
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>♪ Changed by the things I do ♪</i>

74
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,335
♪ <i>True, but it's funny how</i> ♪

75
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>Love has taken me to dark places.</i>

76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>But Los Angeles...</i>

77
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,803
<i>has gotta be as dark as it gets.</i>

78
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,474
<i>When you're running from someone
who thinks they know you,</i>

79
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,101
<i>the best place to hide

80
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,062
<i>because, well, I do.</i>

81
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,271
Hi, gorgeous people!

82
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,148
Just wanna say thank you. Wow.

83
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,650
Three million followers?

84
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm honestly choked up
thinking about how much I love each...

85
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,032
<i>I'm closing my heart,
like an out-of-business bookstore,</i>

86
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,910
<i>and I'm here for the moment
where everyone is too into themselves</i>

87
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,453
<i>to ever connect with another person.</i>

88
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,039
<i>It's the worst city in the world
and the last place I wanna be,</i>

89
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>and that's perfect.</i>

90
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,999
<i>It's temporary.</i>

91
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,129
<i>Regroup, get some cash together,
figure out next moves, go.</i>

92
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,090
<i>Never look back.</i>

93
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,550
<i>It's a chance to get back
to who I really am:</i>

94
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>a quiet guy...</i>

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,514
<i>...who just wants to lead a quiet life.</i>

96
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,149
<i>I've done time in uglier cages.</i>

97
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,777
Welcome. I'm Delilah.

98
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,654
Will Bettelheim. Nice to meet you.

99
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,364
Your credit came back sparkling, Will.

100
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,490
Oh, good, good.

101
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,617
But I looked you up.
You're not on the socials.

102
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,244
Like, at all.

103
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,329
Thought you might be some kind of freak.

104
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,082
Just not great
at keeping up with that stuff.

105
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,127
Do you not keep up
with brushing your teeth?

106
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding. Okay.

107
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,590
I just have this vacancy
on the first floor.

108
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,468
- Do you wanna see it? It's bigger.
- I like the second floor.

109
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,885
It's quieter.

110
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,053
All right.

111
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,432
So rent's due on the third,

112
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,934
No loud music after ten.

113
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,020
Two pet limit.

114
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,732
And don't cook meth in your kitchen.

115
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,858
You got it.

116
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,989
You can keep the furniture if you want
or just let me know

117
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,512
and we can have someone take it out.

118
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,952
The last tenant
kind of left in a hurry, so...

119
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,747
hopefully it'll be better luck for you.

120
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,167
I'm in number one if you need anything.

121
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,625
That sounds great.

122
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,504
All right. See ya.

123
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>Home sweet prison.</i>

124
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,148
<i>It's uncomfortable, all of this.</i>

125
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,692
<i>But that's good, I'm detoxing.</i>

126
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,778
<i>Detox should be uncomfortable.</i>

127
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,072
<i>I've left so much behind.</i>

128
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,034
<i>And I know there's a side of me</i>

129
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,619
<i>that I let get out of control,</i>

130
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,789
<i>and now controlling is everything.</i>

131
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,457
<i>But, that said,</i>

132
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,376
<i>cold turkey leads to rebound,</i>

133
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>leads to heartbreak,</i>

134
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>if not crime scenes,</i>

135
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,964
<i>and posthumous best sellers.</i>

136
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,592
<i>Addiction management is key.</i>

137
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,594
<i>Ten minutes a day.</i>

138
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,721
<i>Do not fixate on any one person.</i>

139
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,765
<i>Do not get involved,
do not even look them up,</i>

140
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>because I know I can get swept up.</i>

141
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,853
<i>But that's not happening.</i>

142
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,731
<i>This is a fresh start.</i>

143
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,866
<i>In my dreams...</i>

144
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,450
<i>Beck's alive.</i>

145
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>She forgives me for everything I did.</i>

146
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,998
<i>She apologizes for everything she did.</i>

147
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,042
<i>And she says, "Don't worry,</i>

148
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,168
<i>Candace is gone.</i>

149
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,295
<i>Forever."</i>

150
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,548
<i>But then I wake up...</i>

151
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,341
<i>and remember.</i>

152
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,178
I think we have
some unfinished business to talk about.

153
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,263
Okay.

154
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,932
Okay, let's go somewhere

155
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,560
and we can sit and talk.

156
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,562
As long as it's nice...

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,147
and public.

158
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,572
Are you gonna tell me what you want?

159
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,198
I'm craving French fries.

160
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,533
Candace...

161
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,786
- Hi. What can I get for you?
- Fries, please, a side of ranch.

162
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,788
Vanilla milkshake.

163
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,248
You want anything, bunny?

164
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,293
- No.
- Okay.

165
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,627
I'll be right back.

166
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,092
I want you to know I want it to stay gone.

167
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,969
I mean, you sure thought I was dead

168
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,892
or you wouldn't have
just left me there, right?

169
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,432
I was prepared to count my blessings
and never come back.

170
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,875
That's not how any of it happened.

171
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,685
So, anyways, there I am,

172
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,312
in a new town,

173
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,063
a new girl,

174
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,649
and I walk into this store,

175
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,485
and there's this book...

176
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,988
by a woman named Guinevere...

177
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,364
Beck.

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,412
You did it again, didn't you?

179
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,999
What do you want, Candace?

180
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,545
To kill you with my bare hands.

181
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,757
I'm kidding.

182
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,800
I could never.

183
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,014
I'm gonna go to the cops,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

184
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,643
Nope, sorry, not that either.

185
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,978
Too easy on you.

186
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>People.</i>

187
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>People are predictable.</i>

188
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>I cannot afford to be predictable.</i>

189
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,287
<i>My life depends on that.</i>

190
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>But love, love is what kept me open,</i>

191
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,669
<i>alive, different, real.</i>

192
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>And I also can't afford to do love,
so you see my dilemma.</i>

193
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>Lady, how many photos does it take?
Come on.</i>

194
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,552
Are you like, "Lady, come on.

195
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,970
How many photos does it take?"

196
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,390
Crazy thing is,
she never posts any of them.

197
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,101
That's, like, gotta be a diagnosis, right?

198
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,145
<i>Precocious, unsupervised kid
who thinks she's not a kid.</i>

199
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,398
Ms. Strauss secretly has six chihuahuas

200
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,941
so she walks them in shifts.

201
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,568
And you?

202
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
You are Will Bettelheim,

203
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,071
LA newbie.

204
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,448
Yeah, that's me.

205
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
<i>Who is protecting her?</i>

206
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,994
<i>No, no, she is not my problem.</i>

207
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,077
What's your Insta?

208
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,038
Or do you only have a Finsta?

209
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,040
- I'm a little behind the times.
- Clearly.

210
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,252
Anyway, I'm @Ellie-Eyeballs.

211
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,754
So...

212
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,463
you have a girlfriend yet?

213
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,967
<i>Holy shit.</i>

214
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719
Ellie, how old are you? Like 14?

215
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,011
Fifteen.

216
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
Basically 16, so...

217
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>No, she's not my problem.</i>

218
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
It was nice to meet you.

219
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,393
Cool.

220
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,062
Manners.

221
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,826
Thank you so much for stopping by.

222
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,941
I appreciate being the first call.

223
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,235
So Delilah, she's not a hooker.

224
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,306
It's what you're thinking, right?

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,823
Yeah, no, she's a reporter,

226
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,991
that guy's a publicist,

227
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,120
and he just paid some crazy kill fee to
not run something about someone famous.

228
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,294
- It's sick, she's a genius.
- Ellie?

229
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,124
No harassing the tenants.

230
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,876
I'm not. We're old friends.

231
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,753
Well, you're late for school, smart-ass.

232
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,588
<i>Too young to be Ellie's mom.</i>

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,090
Is that my shirt? That's my fucking shirt.

234
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,217
- How many times...?
<i>- Sisters.</i>

235
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,721
Can you please not wear that to school
and destroy it, please?

236
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,015
<i>If Delilah counts
as parental supervision,</i>

237
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,976
<i>- it explains everything.
- </i>It looks hotter on me, though.

238
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
Cool story. Any day now.

239
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>Note to self: steer clear
of their entire red flag galaxy.</i>

240
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,815
Hey.

241
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,820
You lay a finger on her,

242
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,657
and I will vivisect
your individual scrotums.

243
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,033
She's a kid.

244
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,830
<i>In Los Angeles,</i>

245
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>grocery stores aren't just a place
you buy carrots,</i>

246
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>they're a pristine, non-GMO Disneyland,</i>

247
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>and king among these is Anavrin.</i>

248
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,702
<i>Come for the spring lettuce mix,</i>

249
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,892
<i>stay for the perfect life
that could be yours</i>

250
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>if you spend enough
and quit gluten, you fucking asshole.</i>

251
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,307
<i>And yeah, obviously, Anavrin is...
wait for it...</i>

252
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,559
<i>"nirvana" spelled backwards.</i>

253
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,272
So, no experience at all in sorting
or bagging perishables?

254
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,234
Well, I'm a quick study.

255
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,029
It's a coveted job.

256
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,532
Yeah, all the casting directors shop here.

257
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,492
- So...
- Oh, I'm not an actor.

258
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,995
Okay, let me xerox some photo ID

259
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
and I'll call you ASAP
and I'll let you know.

260
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,083
Sure thing, ID.

261
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,669
Damn.

262
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,923
- I know... I know I brought it. I just...
- Are you reading that?

263
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,466
Re-reading.

264
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,177
It feels like it gets
more relevant every day, right?

265
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,346
How... so?

266
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh, this guy's struggle trying
to get past his mistakes, you know?

267
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,228
I don't like to get political,
but I will say

268
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,814
our world is done for
if we don't think about that.

269
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,441
How to be better.

270
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,485
- I can't believe you just did that.
- Did...?

271
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,030
Made a Russian novel
sound like something I'd <i>want </i>to read.

272
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,452
Uh, I don't mean to spring this on you...

273
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,871
Ever thought about working in a bookstore?

274
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,252
We've been having a time moving product.

275
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,380
You know, I thought
with this whole hacking democracy thing,

276
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,133
people would be like,
"Yeah, I wanna read some Russian stuff.

277
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,576
What's up with that place?" But...

278
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,928
they're intimidated, you know?

279
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,514
Hm, there's nothing to be intimidated by.

280
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,601
It's human experience. It's universal.

281
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,105
<i>I think I just felt my soul
come back into my body.</i>

282
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,023
I love it.

283
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,357
You sound like such a...

284
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,983
a reader.

285
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,945
Maybe it's 'cause
it's my favorite thing to do.

286
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
That...

287
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,489
and...

288
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,992
recommending the perfect book.

289
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,243
Can you start tomorrow?

290
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,372
- Yeah.
- Perfect. Let's get you an apron.

291
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,916
<i>A new apron?</i>

292
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,416
<i>Joy.</i>

293
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,347
<i>Hello...</i>

294
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,599
<i>you.</i>

295
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,851
<i>No, fuck, no, I'm not doing that.</i>

296
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>I'm not gonna try to figure out
who you are,</i>

297
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>why you look so concerned</i>

298
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,442
<i>about the state of that heirloom tomato.</i>

299
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,114
- Oh, did I get you? Are you okay?
- It's okay.

300
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,950
<i>You have a way with people.</i>

301
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>They just like you.</i>

302
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,331
<i>Your shirt is faded, but fresh.</i>

303
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>You like to take care of things.</i>

304
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,546
<i>Your shoes are clean, but more.</i>

305
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>You walk in a town where nobody walks.</i>

306
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>I won't say hello.
I'll accidentally bump into you.</i>

307
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>You'll never even know I was here.</i>

308
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
Excuse me?

309
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,323
Do you think this peach looks like a butt?

310
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
There is no wrong answer.

311
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,692
It looks a little like a butt, yeah.

312
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,109
Right?

313
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,446
Hm. Thank you.

314
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,156
<i>Are you flirting?</i>

315
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,784
<i>I'd like to think you are,
but it's just... I can't.</i>

316
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,661
I should also inform you that...

317
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,457
all peaches look like butts.

318
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>I should walk away.</i>

319
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,252
Oh, yes.

320
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,631
Well, thank you for your honesty.

321
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,342
I might go out on a limb
and suggest that...

322
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,888
bell peppers can be extremely vaginal
depending on how you cut them.

323
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,308
I hadn't noticed that,
but I definitely will now. Thank you.

324
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,726
Yeah, no problem.

325
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,312
Were you following me?

326
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,313
<i>Shit.</i>

327
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
Well, I mean...

328
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,525
<i>Truth. That is what will
shut this down, truth.</i>

329
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,068
Not initially, but then yes.

330
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,486
I was, completely.

331
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,905
I am sorry...

332
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,656
if I seem skeevy.

333
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,032
No.

334
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,618
I mean, you might've...

335
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
if you looked like a skeeve, which...

336
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,540
I guess is me saying, good choice...

337
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,001
showering today.

338
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,961
Good.

339
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,087
I debated, so...

340
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,546
Hm.

341
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
All right.

342
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,009
Oh!

343
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,845
You work here?

344
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,722
The apron.

345
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,766
Oh, yeah.

346
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,062
Will. I just started in the cafe.

347
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,856
Me too, um, I uh... I manage the kitchen.

348
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,150
I do most of the buying for the store.

349
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
I was just shopping for my dinner.

350
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,364
Anyway, sorry. Love.

351
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,032
It's my name, I mean.

352
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,826
- <i>No.</i>
- Cool. It's nice to meet you, Love.

353
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>No way.</i>

354
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,662
Yeah.

355
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,874
I'll see you in the break room then, Will.

356
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,591
<i>No, not biting.</i>

357
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,885
<i>I'm not that guy anymore,</i>

358
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,887
<i>and I don't think I ever will be again.</i>

359
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,971
<i>I can't be.</i>

360
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,308
<i>Love, you are not for me.</i>

361
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>Mooney's Rare and Used,
this is not.</i>

362
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,280
<i>But hey, who needs Cervantes
when you've got chakra clearing?</i>

363
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,199
<i>Ralph Waldo Emerson? No.</i>

364
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>Reading the Akashic records? Full shelf.</i>

365
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,204
<i>This is gonna be harder than I thought.</i>

366
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,498
<i>But this is the only safe place
for me right now.</i>

367
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>No offense,
you look like you're ready to puke.</i>

368
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,546
Just tell me what you want.

369
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm getting to it.

370
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,966
Here you go.

371
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,265
Now you really look
like you're gonna puke.

372
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,811
Sorry, excuse me.

373
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,864
Mmm.

374
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,287
Shit.

375
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,656
<i>At least when I'm here,
it's less about the people,</i>

376
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,348
<i>more about the books.</i>

377
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,891
Excuse me.

378
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,603
Yeah, how can I help?

379
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,187
How can you help?

380
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,065
Yeah. Um...

381
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,318
Can you tell me
if this Carl Jung book is vegan?

382
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,071
Uh, if the... if the book is...

383
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,655
New here, huh?

384
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,076
Yeah, your apron is, like, very fresh.

385
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,705
<i>Does everyone in LA walk around
like they own the place?</i>

386
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,624
You got me. I just started this week.

387
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,668
The books are made from trees.

388
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,672
- I'm pretty sure those are vegan.
<i>- </i>I'm just messing with you, old sport.

389
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,257
Forty.

390
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,258
- Calvin.
- Hey.

391
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,135
Did you tell our new friend Will here

392
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,513
that it was Vegan Author Month
at the cafe?

393
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,182
I will get Will on the right page.

394
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,725
I know you will.

395
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,309
Will...

396
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,188
I think you are gonna do really well here.

397
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,856
I like your whole look.

398
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,858
It's very, um... I've-read-a-book.

399
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,694
Calvin...

400
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,117
So that's...

401
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,995
Forty's parents own the place, obviously.

402
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,581
Shit. He was being cool just now,

403
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,385
but if he comes back
and it's still wrong...

404
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,418
I got it. Don't worry, Calvin.

405
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,796
Watch the register.

406
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,466
Hi.

407
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,263
Let me guess. Hurricane Forty?

408
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

409
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,266
Don't worry.

410
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,644
He almost never actually fires anyone.

411
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,623
You know how some people are,
like, starring in their own movie?

412
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,315
Well, his...

413
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,610
is about a hilarious misunderstood genius

414
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,195
working with idiots.

415
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,823
Right, one of those.

416
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,076
What? Do...

417
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,745
Do I have something?

418
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,989
No, I was just trying to figure out
what your movie is.

419
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,669
Oh, I think it might be the one where
the woman gets the guy in trouble at work

420
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,254
for slacking off.

421
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,674
I'm sorry, I got to go. Thank you, though.

422
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,401
<i>I cannot let you in.</i>

423
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,616
Are you running away from me?

424
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,494
What? No.

425
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,663
I feel like you are.

426
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,713
- I don't think...
- Don't think.

427
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,438
We have about six minutes,
which I think we can make that work.

428
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,070
You like that?

429
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,491
Now say, "I like that, Love."

430
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,661
I like that... Love.

431
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,501
It's just you...

432
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
and me.

433
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,060
What's wrong?

434
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,394
I don't do this.

435
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,895
Not anymore.

436
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,111
<i>I don't fantasize</i>

437
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>to some impossible version</i>

438
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,282
<i>of a woman I barely know.</i>

439
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,033
<i>It's not good.</i>

440
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,784
<i>No.</i>

441
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,625
<i>It's hard to have
a fresh start, Love,</i>

442
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,086
<i>when the past is on your mind.</i>

443
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,845
Thank you.

444
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,062
Hang on one second.

445
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:56,982
Hello?

446
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,085
<i>You don't think I have
your fucking number?</i>

447
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm not interested
in seeing you dead, Joe.

448
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,737
<i>Truly.</i>

449
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,616
Or turning you in because, best-case,
you go to prison forever.

450
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,493
- I'm hanging up.
<i>- I wouldn't.</i>

451
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,581
See, you'd go to prison as you.

452
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>You'd sit there for the rest of your life
thinking you're a good man.</i>

453
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,130
I'm gonna show you who you really are.

454
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,882
<i>And when you see it...</i>

455
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,343
<i>you'll beg me to turn you in.</i>

456
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,846
It's gonna be really fun
fucking destroying you.

457
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,139
And I deserve that.

458
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,183
Candace, listen to me.

459
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,352
You're insane!

460
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,936
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

461
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,397
I'll see you soon.

462
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,816
It doesn't take a genius to hunt someone

463
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,319
if you really, really want to.

464
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,322
You see, that's another thing
I learned from you.

465
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,988
<i>Bye, Joe.</i>

466
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,794
<i>I'm getting paranoid.</i>

467
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,172
<i>There's no way she found me so soon.</i>

468
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,382
<i>There's no way.</i>

469
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,384
<i>I won't let Candace get in my head.</i>

470
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,969
<i>That's what crazy people do,
make you crazy.</i>

471
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,067
Who asked you to film me?

472
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,150
No one.

473
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,572
It's just for fun.

474
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,990
<i>Not a good liar.</i>

475
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,742
I'm not mad.

476
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,037
Just give me the phone.

477
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,758
You asshole.

478
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,886
I was making a movie for school.

479
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,305
Ellie.

480
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,892
<i>Shit.</i>

481
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,394
<i>Just a grown man</i>

482
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,771
<i>who put a hand on a teenaged girl.</i>

483
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,898
<i>All good, as long as I fix it.</i>

484
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,525
<i>Which I...</i>

485
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,237
<i>will do right after I fix another thing
I've gotta fix first.</i>

486
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,198
<i>Fuck, I'm starting to believe
in cosmic punishment, Love.</i>

487
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,534
<i>Not just punishment,</i>

488
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,869
<i>actual death.</i>

489
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,662
<i>If LA is hell,</i>

490
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>surely the Hollywood DMV
is the Ninth Circle.</i>

491
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,629
Hi, I need a driver's license.

492
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,007
- ID and proof of residence?
- Yep, it's all there.

493
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,309
Is everything okay?

494
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,436
Slow system.

495
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,940
That is completely unacceptable.

496
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,585
Ma'am,
come up to the window, please.

497
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,319
Just wait, I'll fix this.

498
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,904
<i>I know that voice.</i>

499
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,864
Sir?

500
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,866
This woman has an appointment.

501
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,994
Just like I just had an appointment.
You just helped me five seconds ago.

502
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,246
<i>What are the chances?</i>

503
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,091
She has to come back with somebody
that can speak whatever she speaks.

504
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,084
Arabic? I mean, it's pretty common.

505
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,170
Excuse me, does anybody speak Arabic?

506
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,546
- Anyone?
- I can.

507
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,923
Thank you, sir, please.

508
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,759
Come here. Nobody's gonna skip you, right?

509
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,637
Thank you, everyone.

510
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,017
See?

511
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,521
Someone who can help.
Wasn't that hard to ask.

512
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,773
Some people, huh?

513
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,901
Okay, this is all in order.

514
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,864
You'll step over there
to take the written test.

515
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,738
Okay, thank you.

516
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,785
Will. Kismet, right?

517
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,370
I mean, what are the chances?

518
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,955
I don't always...

519
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,414
cause a scene.

520
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,041
I promise.

521
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,960
That was pretty impressive.

522
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,213
Good, because I actually
frequently do cause a scene.

523
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,840
Well, I have to take this test.

524
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,302
Well, you got this. Here.

525
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,348
For luck.

526
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,353
Next in line, please step forward.

527
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,483
<i>Are you really who you seem to be?</i>

528
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,444
<i>Could anyone be that light and fearless?</i>

529
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,728
<i>You know, I didn't
because I promised myself I wouldn't,</i>

530
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,783
<i>but now it would be weird not to, right?</i>

531
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,289
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

532
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,083
<i>Are you the only woman in Los Angeles</i>

533
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,002
<i>not showing off for strangers?</i>

534
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,630
<i>Speaks well of you,
but does make it trickier.</i>

535
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,012
<i>Unfortunately,
I know exactly what I need to do.</i>

536
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,287
Ellie.

537
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

538
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,834
It's a new phone.

539
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,712
Since it's my fault you...

540
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,006
It's a little upgrade.

541
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,519
You'll be making movies
on the thing, right?

542
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,511
<i>Cost a chunk of my rent,</i>

543
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,639
<i>and the more money I need,
the longer I stay,</i>

544
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,849
<i>but one problem at a time.</i>

545
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,977
<i>I guess that's Ellie for "thank you."</i>

546
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,482
I didn't mean to scare you.

547
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
You didn't.

548
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,234
Of course not.

549
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,403
I'm sorry, anyway.

550
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,865
I was trying to do
this whole <i>vérité</i> thing.

551
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,452
You know, like, you see <i>Tangerine?</i>

552
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,831
I thought you were, like...

553
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,083
hip.

554
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,085
Honestly, I'm more of a book guy.

555
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,630
Why are you robbing your eyeballs
of all things that are good?

556
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,923
Tell you what...

557
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,968
I'm making you a list.

558
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:03,390
Like, how do you even function
in a world without art?

559
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,059
Don't say you get it in books.
Books take too long.

560
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,436
I'll make you a deal.
You make me that list...

561
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,188
I'll make you a list.

562
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,565
Nothing long. I have a life.

563
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,649
Okay.

564
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,945
Oh, my God, this bitch's feed is so fake.

565
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,740
How do you know?

566
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,075
How... how do you know...

567
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,785
that it's, uh...

568
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,577
it's... it's fake?

569
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,873
Uh, I'm an American and I'm 15.

570
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,500
Why do you ask?

571
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,670
I thought you were too good
for the internets.

572
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,090
Actually, I'm thinking of joining.

573
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,135
I'm just a private person.

574
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,469
Well, so am I.

575
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,557
It's why my page is about my work,
not my dumb face.

576
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,183
See?

577
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,064
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

578
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,028
This is great.

579
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,030
Yeah, I know.

580
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,701
God, you really need a sensei,
don't you?

581
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,203
Are you offering to help?

582
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,456
What's in it for me?

583
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,791
I'll owe you one.

584
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,835
That'll work.

585
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,508
Okay, first thing to know
about being authentic and actually cool...

586
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,179
feeds that aren't lame
help people understand you.

587
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,931
But don't overshare, like, your breakfast.

588
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,392
Unless, I don't know,
is breakfast your brand?

589
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,852
I don't know that I have a brand.

590
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
It's not that deep.

591
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,231
<i>Your brand could be, like...</i>

592
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,984
<i>you have good taste in whatever</i>

593
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,694
<i>your thing is.</i>

594
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,864
<i>So go places, look,</i>

595
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,009
<i>if it's interesting, take a pic.</i>

596
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,368
<i>Don't filter, don't hashtag.</i>

597
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,162
<i>Hashtags are thirsty.</i>

598
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,082
That's literally the handbook
to being dope in a sea of basic losers.

599
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,585
Which... most people are.

600
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,421
Just lean into your thing, Will.

601
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,132
But in a not-try-hard

602
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,092
<i>yet-you're-low-key-fascinating
kind of way.</i>

603
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,553
<i>That's how you get her
to fall in love with you.</i>

604
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,847
- What?
- That's why you doing it, right?

605
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,390
- You like someone.
- No.

606
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,267
That's the only reason
anyone posts anything.

607
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,602
I don't like anyone.

608
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,103
Okay.

609
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,565
Uh, the other reason to post is revenge.

610
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,195
You have a nemesis?

611
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
I don't have a nemesis.

612
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,116
Don't take this the wrong way, Will.

613
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,162
Please be not this boring
on your Instagram, okay?

614
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,122
I will try my best.

615
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,582
My secretary will bill you.

616
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,585
Thank you.

617
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,764
<i>It's come to this:</i>

618
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,142
<i>get online to blend in,
just long enough to get out</i>

619
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,019
<i>before Candace finds me.</i>

620

<i>Create a feed of my alleged life
while life happens around me,</i>

621
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,358
<i>but how would I know?</i>

622
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,901
<i>Not that there's much to see.</i>

623
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,200
<i>Friend requested.</i>

624
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,871
<i>Okay.</i>

625
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,249
<i>This sun is nice.</i>

626
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>Any place is probably beautiful</i>

627
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,004
<i>when you stop running for one second.</i>

628
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,506
<i>I just want to stop running, Love.</i>

629
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,592
<i>I want a home.</i>

630
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,142
Mom?

631
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
Mommy?

632
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,606
- Mommy?
- Joe!

633
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,940
Baby.

634
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,858
Right here.

635
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,111
I was afraid you left.

636
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,406
I went to get sunscreen.

637
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,907
Come here.

638
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,585
It's nice here, right?

639
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,212
We should come here every summer.

640
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,757
It could be our home away from home.

641
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,508
You are home.

642
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,386
Sure, we're home.

643
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,931
No, I mean, my home is you.

644
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,271
Me too, Joey.

645
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,940
Me too, you.

646
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,777
Hey.

647
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,488
Go get some ice cream.

648
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,241
Then meet me back at our favorite spot.

649
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,744
You know, the one from yesterday.
Remember?

650
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,206
And build me a sandcastle.

651
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,289
Okay?

652
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,213
Mommy will be back in just a few shakes.

653
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,964
Okay?

654
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,115
<i>I'm an idiot.</i>

655
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,994
<i>Did I sunburn </i>through <i>this t-shirt?</i>

656
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,037
<i>How is that a thing?</i>

657
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,669
<i>Worth it, all worth it, Love.</i>

658
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,219
<i>Married.</i>

659
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>Married?</i>

660
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,611
Hey, Brooklyn!

661
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,448
I know you're in there.

662
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,325
<i>Oh, the happily-wed missus.</i>

663
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,411
I'm sick.

664
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,665
You're a rookie with a sunburn
is what you are.

665
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,167
Calvin told me at the store.

666
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,250
Let me in.

667
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,504
I can help.

668
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,928
Do you have a medical license?

669
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,013
I'm serious, though.

670
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,973
You didn't need to come
all the way over here.

671
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,349
It's no problem.

672
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,268
I live right in the neighborhood.

673
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,855
All right.

674
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,775
Is that salad dressing?

675
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,485
No, it's apple cider vinegar.

676
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,487
May I?

677
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,492
- You want me to...?
- Yes.

678
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,247
Trust me, in five minutes
you're going to love me for this.

679
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,749
Smells great.

680
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,085
Shut up.

681
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,634
Are you okay? This must hurt.

682
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,512
It doesn't.

683
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,557
<i>You felt that too.</i>

684
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,310
<i>But you're married, so you're safe.</i>

685
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,896
<i>It's actually perfect.</i>

686
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,189
<i>Keep it light,</i>

687
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,272
<i>breezy.</i>

688
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,693
There. We'll give that a minute.

689
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,991
Okay, now I need to ask you a question

690
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,202
that's deadly serious and deeply personal.

691
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,869
Okay.

692
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,039
Is that 99-cent ramen?

693
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,917
- Yeah.
- No.

694
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,253
- Yeah.
- No, Will, no.

695
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,838
You're an Angeleno now.

696
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,673
I'm not, actually.

697
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,008
You know, you ex-New Yorkers
are the worst.

698
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,220
I mean, haven't... haven't you ever...
fallen in love

699
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,596
reading Joan Didion

700
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,181
or Raymond Chandler,

701
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,516
or Francesca Lia Block?

702
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,599
You know, these...

703
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,856
- You've never read Joan fucking Didion.
- A little.

704
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,108
- She's next.
- No, you, you're missing out, okay?

705
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,609
This city, is...

706
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,236
it's... it's...

707
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,863
a million cities, it's...

708
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,155
I mean...

709
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,453
We're going. We're going!

710
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,537
Where, exactly?

711
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,749
As many places as we need to
to convert you.

712
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,958
Come on.

713
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,545
Let's go!

714
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,255
- Okay.
- Come on, snob!

715
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,715
All right, hang on a minute.

716
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,966
Need to get my jacket.

717
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,511
Okay.

718
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,472
Just gotta lock up.

719
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,061
<i>It's my favorite place in the city.</i>

720
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,063
<i>I have this theory.</i>

721
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,192
<i>It's not my theory, it's the late,
great food writer Jonathan Gold's,</i>

722
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,403
<i>whose life mission was to know
Los Angeles the best way:</i>

723
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,945
<i>through food.</i>

724
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,656
<i>And, uh, he said,</i>

725
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,451
<i>"There exists for each of us
a perfect taco."</i>

726
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,534
<i>Point is...</i>

727
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,577
Is it good?

728
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,831
<i>...we are gonna find you
your perfect bite.</i>

729
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,315
- It's amazing.
- But is it perfect?

730
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,374
It's a taco.

731
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,795
We have more work to do. Come, let's go.

732
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,298
Wait, hang on, this?

733
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,821
- You're telling me...
- No, no, no. Come on, come on, please.

734
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,511
You are going to love it.
It's going to be so worth it.

735
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,556
Okay.

736
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,558
Thank you.

737
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,971
So you really didn't like it?

738
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,981
No! No, no, no.
I would bathe in that sauce.

739
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,149
Stop lying to me.

740
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,360
I'll figure you out.

741
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,736
This is science.

742
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,155
<i>♪ Victories ♪</i>

743
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,532
<i>♪ Look better when you've called it... ♪</i>

744
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:31,040

745

746
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,422
Oh, so close.

747
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,548
Inches away.

748
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,885
Okay.

749
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,888
Research complete.

750
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,099
Final destination.

751
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,393
Let's hit it!

752
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,046
<i>Let me tell you a little bit
about yourself, Will Bettelheim.</i>

753
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,799
<i>You are not a snob.</i>

754
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,469
<i>You're just old-fashioned.</i>

755
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,931
<i>You like things that are real,</i>

756
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,142
<i>made right by people who care.</i>

757
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,185
<i>You like strong flavors.</i>

758
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,021
<i>Gimmicks don't seduce you.</i>

759
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,273
<i>What seduces you is the real thing.</i>

760
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,151
<i>Therefore...</i>

761
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,155
Roast chicken.

762
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,407
In cooking school,

763
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,160
they used to tell us that you could
tell everything about a cook

764
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,661
based on their roast chicken,

765
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,246
so I became a bit obsessive.

766
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,498
And you are gonna benefit from that.

767
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,334
You went to cooking school?

768
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,625
Yeah.

769
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,086
That's a long story.

770
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,759
<i>Voilà.</i>

771
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,346
Okay.

772
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,891
Make sure you have some skin and carrot...

773
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,976
and some crispy potato...

774
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,854
and then I'll rub it around
in the reduction a little bit.

775
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,443
- May I eat it?
- Yes, you may eat it.

776
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,034
<i>I get it now.</i>

777
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,951
Well?

778
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,123
<i>It's everything I like,
made exquisitely, but what's perfect...</i>

779
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,501
<i>is you made it for me.</i>

780
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,086
Is that you're speechless?

781
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,922
Perfect bite?

782
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,384
Perfect.

783
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,637
It's perfect.

784
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Yes!

785
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,347
I knew it.

786
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,933
You were tough...

787
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
but...

788
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,186
I am a champion.

789
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,526
Shit.

790
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,487
- I'm sorry. Did I say...
- No.

791
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,948
I have to tell you something, and...

792
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,908
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

793
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,328
The community garden that we walked by?

794
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,914
I got married there...

795
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,957
three years ago.

796
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,459
Um...

797
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,547
We met in school and we were young, but...

798
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,673
I just knew...

799
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,037
- I'm sorry if I sent the wrong signal...
- No, he's dead.

800
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,972
Yeah, conversation killer.

801
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,351
He got sick.

802
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,978
And they, um...

803
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,564
they tried to figure it out.

804
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,859
But... they did not.

805
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,531
- Love, I'm so sorry.
- No.

806
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,408
No, it's...

807
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,832
It is what it is.

808
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,501
It was almost two years ago now.

809
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,669
And, like, look...

810
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,588
my life's great.

811
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,340
And also, nobody really understands.

812
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,759
I mean, who our age gets married,
let alone widowed?

813
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,636
It's, like...

814
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,805
Victorian.

815
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,934
So, you know, people are nice, but...

816
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,646
they can't really fathom
what I'm going through.

817
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,650
Yeah, it's lonely.

818
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,944
I can imagine.

819
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,738
Yeah, I know.

820
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,701
Ever since it happened, I've been able
to see this thing in people...

821
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,370
who've been through it.

822
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,208
I see that every time I look in your eyes.

823
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,085
Yeah.

824
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,922
You've felt it.

825
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,301
Real love.

826
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,888
Real loss.

827
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,516
Yeah.

828
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,193
Yeah, well...

829
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,986
Did you fall in love?

830
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,029
LA?

831
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,907
Is it so terrible?

832
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,869
It's not terrible.

833
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,829
Good.

834
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,546
I, uh, I got you a, um...

835
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,590
a parting gift.

836
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,252
Yeah, I thought about getting you
something happy, but...

837
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,849
<i>Of course.</i>

838
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,227
<i>- Joan Didion.</i>
- Let's face it,

839
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,396
what you're more interested in
is something...

840
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,148
smart and complex.

841
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,776
A little... dark.

842
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,735
Right?

843
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,239
That's what makes you feel at home.

844
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,740
How do you know that?

845
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,577
Well, 'cause...

846
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
me too.

847
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>I wanted to think you don't know me.</i>

848
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,005
<i>You can't, but I'm not too proud
to say when I'm wrong.</i>

849
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,008
<i>And maybe I was wrong about you,</i>

850
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,678
<i>and maybe, even a bit, all of LA.</i>

851
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:22,141
<i>And all I can say is,
I hope I'm also wrong about me.</i>

852
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,435
<i>Maybe I don't need to shut down forever.</i>

853
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,187
<i>Maybe I don't need to run away so fast.</i>

854
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,315
<i>And if that could be...</i>

855
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,733
<i>with you...</i>

856
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,234
Blow.

857
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,235
Ellie.

858
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,487
God, it's from <i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

859
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,821
It's going on your list.

860
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,532
It's two a.m. Does your sister...

861
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
Oh, shut up, Dad.

862
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,952
She's right inside.

863
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
I just have insomnia.

864
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,790
From the 14 Frappuccinos.

865
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,667
Okay, sorry. I just wanna make sure...

866
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,961
Okay, Mr. Rogers, good night.

867
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,045
Good night.

868
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,297
Oh, Will,

869
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,342
someone came by looking for you.

870
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,092
Old friend?

871
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,306
Jesse. No, Jasper.

872
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,184
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back

873
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,644
and that he'll be by.

874
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,729
- <i>Fuck.</i>
- Thanks.

875
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,273
Honestly, he seemed a little creepy.

876
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,236
What can I say, friend?
I have creepy taste in friends.

877
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,030
Ew!

878
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,029
Who is Jasper?

879
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,783
Why is he looking for you...

880
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,367
Will?

881
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,580
How are we gonna take care
of this problem?

882
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,542
<i>So here's the thing, Love.</i>

883
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,626
Cut!

884
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,754
<i>It wasn't easy for me to get here,</i>

885
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,964
<i>to buy myself a little time,</i>

886
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,800
<i>this slim chance at a new life.</i>

887
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,552
<i>And then...</i>

888
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,722
<i>I saw you.</i>

889
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,144
<i>And, you know, I really do believe
that things happen for a reason,</i>

890
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,563
<i>that all the hard stuff and the craziness,</i>

891
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,148
<i>and frankly, my own mistakes...</i>

892
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,151
<i>they maybe all led me here...</i>

893
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,236
<i>for a reason.</i>

894
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,071
<i>At least I hope...</i>

895
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,573
<i>that's true.</i>

896
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,868
<i>Because I'm working as hard as I can
to make a fresh start here.</i>

897
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,996
- What the hell were you thinking, Calvin?
- Ray said to stock more fiction.

898
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,349
Yeah, he meant fiction
that people actually wanna read.

899
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,213
- Okay, I just figured that...
- What?

900
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,817
There's a human alive
who wants to read <i>Crime and Punishment?</i>

901
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,298
Look, dude, find a way to move these

902
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,759
or, uh... <i>something's </i>moving.

903
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
<i>It's delicate,</i>

904
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,305
<i>the whole... thing.</i>

905
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,724
<i>I have this vacancy
on the first floor.</i>

906
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,059
<i>I like the second floor.</i>

907
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,728
<i>'Cause it's not just a new home.</i>

908
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,981
<i>It's a new me.</i>

909
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,716
<i>I live right in the neighborhood.</i>

910
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,619
<i>Kismet, right?</i>

911
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,287
<i>I mean, what are the chances?</i>

912
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,248
<i>And when something like that happens,</i>

913
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,331
<i>when it's right,</i>

914
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,753
<i>you start to feel everything aligning,
like fate saying yes.</i>

915
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,005
<i>But again, delicate.</i>

916
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,842
<i>Anyway, this is a bad time,
the worst time,</i>

917
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,468
<i>for a complication.</i>

918
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,514
<i>Maybe I should run right now, Love.</i>

919
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,226
<i>But now I don't want to.</i>

920
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,105
<i>I need to figure out a way
to see this through,</i>

921
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,606
<i>whatever it is...</i>

922
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
<i>with you.</i>

923
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,047
<i>You win, Love.</i>

924
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,924
<i>I'll stay.</i>

925
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,820
