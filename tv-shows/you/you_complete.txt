Well, hello there.

Who are you?

Based on your vibe, a student.

Your blouse is loose.

You're not here to be ogled,
but those bracelets, they jangle.

You like a little attention.

Okay, I bite.

You search the books.
Fiction, "F" through "K."

Now...

Hmm, you're not
the standard insecure nymph

hunting for Faulkner you'll never finish.

Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.

Who will you buy?

Sorry.

You sound apologetic,
like you're embarrassed to be a good girl,

and you murmur your first word to me.

Hello.

Do you work here?

Guilty.

-Can I help you find something?
-Paula Fox.

It's a good choice.

Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

Follow me.

She's gonna be in here.

"Celebrity authors"?
I thought Fox was pretty obscure.

She is Courtney Love's
maternal grandmother.

You're not expected to know that.

Good. I didn't.

Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here
who's even tangentially famous.

He thinks it sells more books.

That's sad.

People buying books
because of what's popular,

and not because they wanna be moved
or changed in some way.

Yeah. It's an epidemic.

Yeah, you see this guy?
Here, the glasses, behind you.

He just grabbed Dan Brown's latest
on the way in.

So he's gonna wander around
for another, like, five or ten minutes,

just to find something legitimate
to buy with it.

Oh, like the cereal guys buy
when they're really there for condoms.

Only makes it more conspicuous.
Like, own your shit.

If Dan Brown's your kink,
then be out about it.

At the end of the day,

people really are disappointing,
aren't they?

Sometimes they surprise you.

-Paula Fox. Top shelf. You want me to...
-Oh, no, I got it.

Oh. Are you not wearing a bra?

And you want me to notice.

If this was a movie,

I'd grab you
and we'd go at it right in the stacks.

Have you read her fiction?
Desperate Characters, it's her best.

That's what I keep hearing.

-You haven't read Desperate Characters?
-I know. I know.

I'm worried
it's not gonna live up to the hype.

I can safely say it is that good.

That's a high endorsement.
And from a bookstore clerk, nonetheless.

Well, it's bookstore manager.

Hello? Anyone working here?

-Asshole.
-Mmm...

Whoa.

Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

He's just pissed he's gotta
buy Salinger to feel respectable

when all he really wants to do
is eat Cheetos and jerk it to iPorn

before washing it all down
with a Dan Brown chaser.

Have a nice day, sir.

Okay, I'm going for it.

-Good. You won't regret it.
-I'd better not.

Paula Fox. Nice.

You know, she was, uh,
Courtney Love's maternal grandmother.

That's why I'm buying it.

You have enough cash to cover this,
but you want me to know your name.

-"Guinevere"?
-Yeah.

My parents were assholes
with the whole naming thing.

But everyone just calls me Beck.

And you're Joe...

Goldberg.

Everyone calls me Joe.

Aren't you gonna tell me
to have a nice day?

You have a nice day, Beck.

You have one yourself, Joe.

You smiled, laughed at my jokes,

told me your name, asked for mine.

She write her number on there?
She was on you hard.

No, she was just being nice.

I'd be googling the hell out of her
right now.

You know her full name.

That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

What do I tell you?
Always be closing that shit.

If you need me,
I'll be in cookbooks.

But for work. Not for fun. I swear.

At the end of the day, people are
really just disappointing, aren't they?

But are you, Beck? Are you?

Yes, people find "the one."

I believe that. I try to stay open.

I was in love once.
She broke my heart, Beck.

Ugh, she really did a number on me.

I should've seen the signs.

But we never do when we're in love.

Exhibit A. Claudia and Ron.

I went out for a couple of drinks.
Get off my back.

Claudia's a nurse. Single parent.

Leave me alone!
You're on your phone...

You think she knew Ron was a shitbag
when she fell in love?

No, she thought he was a prince.

Hey, Paco.

'Sup, Joe?

And now,

- hers is not the only life she ruined.
- Leave me alone!

Why is coming home such a chore for you?

Is everything cool in there?

Yeah, Mom and Ron are just talking.

You always go out
with your friends!

-And I'm sick of it!
-Wow.

You are burning through that book,
aren't you?

Reads quick. It's good.

Let me know when you finish.
I'll get you another one.

Screw you, Ron! Get out of here!
Leave me alone.

Are you hungry?

'Cause, you know,
I just got this meatball sub,

but I remembered
I have Thai from last night.

Nah. My mom will just
make me something later.

That's a shame. This won't keep.
It's getting tossed.

You sure, Joe?

"All for one and one for all."

The point, Beck...
Love is, uh, tricky.

A guy needs to protect himself.

I had to be sure you're safe.

And your name
was a glorious place to start.

Not a lot of Guinevere Becks.

And there you were.
Every account set to public.

You want to be seen, heard, known.

Of course, I obliged.

Born and raised, Nantucket Island.

A brother, Clyde, and sister, Anya.

Your parents really were assholes
about the names.

Your folks split when you were 12.
Your dad dropped out of the picture.

Went to Brown
where you majored in lit. Cool.

And minored in douchebags. Hmm.

And then on to NYC to conquer an MFA
and make your mark, presumably.

Now you still write. Barely.

Too busy living out moments
you won't remember five years from now.

I know this because you post
about this life all the goddamn time.

Candidly, it's the least
appealing thing about you, Beck.

You posted this hours after our encounter.

I was concerned you didn't mention
that cute guy in a bookstore.

And then I realized
your online life isn't real.

It's a collage.

You paste this Beck up. This...

together, lovable, cute,
bendy little creature.

If anything, the fact that
you didn't share me with your followers

only confirms we really connected.

The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

There it is, with its big, naked windows.

It's nice. Too nice.

I'm thinking subsidized school housing.

Jesus! It's like you've never
seen a horror movie or the news.

But you want people to watch, don't you?

You know,
I plan on asking you about this quality

when we get to know each other better.

A proposal.

Why don't we
spend the day together tomorrow?

Just you and me?

To everyone out there
chasing their dreams, don't give up.

And in the meantime, mac and cheese!

It's cute. Not deep. But cute.
Is there more to you? Let's find out.

Our day starts at the ass-crack of dawn.

I know from your posted schedule
that you teach a 6:30 class

called Get Up N Flow.

You caress the sweaty backs of bulimic,
dead-eyed real mommies of SoHo...

I am loving your form today, Tasha.

...offering smiles
and lies of encouragement.

By 10:00, you're at campus
to TA a Romantics class

and play Vanna White to some shirt.

Morning, Professor Leahy.

I told you, it's Paul.
Are you ready for class?

Professor Obvious wants to fuck you.

Now, you're smart.
You let him think one day he might.

And what's the harm in that, right?

After class,
you head to your favorite cafÃ©

to write for the first time all day.

But your life doesn't cooperate.

Your wealthy girlfriends
have just now woken up,

and have nothing better to do

than plan their next pointless
yet instagrammable night.

Can we get real for a second?

You have questionable taste in friends,
Beck.

- Cheers!
- Yeah!

- Oh, yes. Happy birthday!
- Thank you so much.

And expensive taste in lives.

-Ready?
-Thank you.

Do you like it?

No, I hate it. Of course I love it!

Jason didn't even
get her something that nice,

and Annika finally let him do anal.

- Oh, my God!
- Please, please, it was time.

Please open my gift next and tell me
how much you hate me then, lady.

A butterfly? It's my spirit animal
for the year. You remembered?

Only 'cause you wouldn't shut up about it.

You want so badly to be one of them.

- Happy birthday.
- You look so beautiful.

Well, they've got nothing to do
after this.

So, yeah, they'll party till 5:00
and scrape it together tomorrow.

But you can't.
You have to work for a living.

A McQueen, Beck? How much was it?

It was on clearance.

They haven't put a McQueen scarf
on clearance

since he hung himself in 2010.

It'd be too much
even if she did deserve it,

which she does not.

Hmm. Not all your friends are dumb.

You always do this.

You make, like, a big gesture
that you can't afford because...

- I'm sorry, you're too nice.
- It's no big deal. I had, um, a gift card.

How broke are you?

Just tell me what's up.

Actually sounds like she cares.

Look, I appreciate--

Why don't you just let me
loan you some cash?

Okay? I keep telling you, it's nothing.

Also, sounds condescending.

You know I'd do anything for you.
Don't forget that.

-Sure you can't come out with us?
-I gotta write.

Virtuous. Catch you later?

Is that the best friend you've got?

If so, Beck, you really are alone.

Your social media's a liar.

It says
you're a happy-go-lucky dilettante.

But, underneath it all,
you seem like the genuine article.

Stretched ADD thin, sure,
but as soon as the door closes...

you're back at the keyboard,
trying to write.

Thanks.

Keep the change, man.

Hey. Let me up.

Uh, Beck, who the fuck is this?

My best friend walked in
on you getting your dick sucked

by some random woman in a bathroom
at a party that I took you to!

I was wasted. I didn't even finish.

That's your apology? "I didn't cum."
That's the one you're going with?

I obviously shouldn't have gone
in the bathroom

with any girl that wasn't you.

But she said she had good coke,
and I'd been seriously stressed.

I thought,
when Johno and I started our line,

it was gonna be like
picking out flavors and shit.

It turns out it's 16-hour lectures
on microbial management.

And that's why no one starts
their own artisanal soda company,

and why America has to keep drinking crap
that's giving 'em cancer.

You actually managed to connect
your illicit blowjob to curing cancer.

I'm genuinely impressed.

Beck, I...

Seriously, I am drowning in work.

I don't have time to keep hooking up
or whatever it is you're even capable of.

I know I've done some stupid shit,
but I'm on it now.

I don't wanna be
just some guy you sleep with.

God, you make me insane.

Way to go, Beck.
Looks like a catch.

Benjamin J. Ashby III.
Oh, there's three of them.

Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

His father is the Ben Ashby
of Ashby Brokerage.

Two failed careers. Model. Oh, boy.

And co-creator of a dating app

that connects people
through musical tastes called LoveHooks.

Current CEO of Home Soda
Artisanal Beverages.

Motto...

"Drink better by hand,"
which makes no sense,

but evokes a homespun quality

that lines up with a guy
who wears $600 Japanese sneakers.

The hair, the privilege he tries to hide
with retweets of Black Lives Matter.

Not to sound judgey, but this guy
is everything wrong with America.

See, this is why I do my research.

You fall for the wrong men.

Bad men.

You let them in. You let them hurt you.

Too far away to know for sure,
but my guess is,

if he came anywhere close
to making you cum,

you would've made a Broadway show
out of it.

But you didn't, 'cause he didn't.

-"Desperate Characters."
-Yeah, I just got it.

Borrow it when I'm done.
It's supposed to be her best.

Johno's consultant we brought in,

she's been all over me
about this kind of thing.

Saged the crap out of the office.

The book title
has the word "desperate" in it.

You don't want to think of yourself
as a desperate character, Beck.

Because you're the opposite, babe.

You're the smartest girl I know.

Honestly, you blow me away.

Oh, shit. Gotta roll.
Johno's blowing up my phone.

Hey, you should come by the office,
test out some new flavors.

We're doing cumin.
I know how much you like Indian food.

Sure. Sounds good.

It looks good on you, by the way.

The extra weight.

Yeah. Hey. I'm on my way, bro.

You guys ordering pizzas?

Yeah, don't dick me over like last time.
Gluten-free crust.

Not from that vegan place.
Vegan cheese tastes like asshole.

I'm talking French gourmet shit.

No. Johno. Johno. Listen to me.

They can't do half-gluten-free
'cause it's dough.

They have to use a spelt dough.

So you didn't finish.

Just like that.

Thank you. You're so kind.

I don't suppose you can
help me get a cab, can you?

Of course.

-Thanks.
-Yeah.

Wow. Don't tell me
you're finished already.

Almost.

It's so good.

Sometimes the dialogue's weird, though.

Like when they're killing each other
and still all nice about it.

Well, it was the 19th century.
People still had manners.

I was hoping we could go get another one.

I mean, it's pretty late, Pac.
I don't know.

Oh, yeah.

I want you to cum...

Something's
in the air tonight, Beck,

'cause everyone but me is getting action.

Even the lovebirds made up.

Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure.

Did you know
Dumas was a black dude? I googled him.

His grandmother was a slave,
and his dad was a brigadier general.

He killed like half a battalion.

You probably knew that
since you work at a bookstore.

I didn't.

-How'd you get to work here, anyway?
-Mr. Mooney gave me a job

when I was just a little older than you.
He sort of took me in.

-He seems nice.
-He's a dick.

But he loved books,
and he taught me to love them, too.

I never see him around here.

-Is he dead?
-No. He's just old.

I'm sorry, Pac.

I had one back here for you,
but Ethan must've sold it.

-Sold what?
-Your next read.

Come on. I'll show you
where we keep the good stuff.

Freaky.

It's the Cage.

It's where we keep
early editions and collectibles.

It's cold.

Sixty-five degrees. For the books.

If the zombies come,
this is where I'm hiding.

Why don't you set that milkshake down?

Careful, Joseph.

When it comes to the value of a book,
it's all about condition. I'll show you.

It's always 65 degrees.

Humidity 40%.
Too moist, the pages can mildew...

Too dry, they get brittle.

Always keep books upright

so the spines don't become rolled
or warped or what we call "cocked."

And we never wanna
fold or crease the pages.

And we dust the covers
with a chemical-free duster.

Always towards the spine.

Under no circumstances
is there any sunlight in this room.

Sunlight can ruin a book as fast as fire.

Faster.

That's a lot of stuff to remember
just to take care of some old books.

The most valuable things in life
are usually...

the most helpless.

So they need people like us
to protect them. You know?

"Don Quicks-oat."

Quixote.
It's about a guy who believes in chivalry,

so he decides to be an old-school knight.

What's chivalry?

It's treating people with respect.
Especially women. Like men should.

It's good. It's one of my favorites.

I probably shouldn't take this home.

It's not a first edition,
it's just an old one.

Besides, I trust you.

-Where you been, Paco?
-We just grabbed some milkshakes.

-You just walk off with strangers?
-Joe's not a stranger.

Yes, he is.

Inside. Now. Okay?

Keep away from my girlfriend's kid.

Look, I'm sorry, but he was out here,
and he could hear everything in there.

Don't you tell me how to parent.

This whole nice guy act
might work on other people.

I'm a parole officer, 15 years,
and I can see what you are.

Well, you're an alcoholic shitbag
who beats women.

So, please, enlighten me.

You're a freak.

So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

There are scary people
in the world, Beck.

That's why it's important to be safe.

And why I have to do what I'm about to do.

Fun fact.

Did you know the law requires
gas leaks to be investigated?

I've been learning a lot since I met you.

Hey, Beck? You left the door open again.

I thought we said
we weren't gonna do that anymore.

I was careful to call the gas company
on a day when you had a full schedule.

I wouldn't wanna scare you.

Hey. Is Beck here?

Nope. Super let me in.
Someone reported a leak.

Right. Yeah. She mentioned that.
Is everything okay?

Yeah, all clear.
Tell your girlfriend there's no leak.

I'm done, so...

Okay. Thanks. Well, I can just lock up.

I just need to know who you really are.

Besides a broke poetry student

in a subsidized apartment
you could never afford.

Where is it, Beck?

When we live together,
your place won't be a pigsty.

I'll clean for us.

And you won't eat all this frozen shit.
I'll cook for you every day. I promise.

I'll even do your laundry.

And take care of your favorite books.

I'll make our bed every morning.

Oh, there it is.

And no matter how hard you fight me,

I will always make sure
you password protect your devices.

"One day
You won't need love anymore

One day, you won't walk through the world

As though it was your job
To hold everything up

The sun, the sky
The hard part of the night"

It's good.

It's quite good.

But, Beck, where's the rest?
You owe me 20 more pages.

I've been, honestly,
working every day, and grading papers--

If the schedule is too rigorous,
drop back to part-time.

But then I won't qualify to TA.

I need the cash. The housing.
I'd lose my place.

You'll figure it out.
You're smart, or you wouldn't be here.

-Please, Professor Leahy--
-Paul.

Paul. I'll get you the pages
by the end of the week.

I can't go to part-time, okay?

I'm rooting for you.

You just need to keep up.

Happy to discuss further.
After class some evening.

If we're gonna seriously discuss poetry,
it should be over a drink.

There's a little gastropub I love...

I would love that, Paul.

Just, uh, how would your wife feel
about you--

About me helping out an aspiring writer?
She's used to my generosity.

So, Thursday night, then?

Thursday night it is.

Excellent.

And don't worry about the next few days.
Just go home and get caught up.

Need to see you tonight.

Will if I can, babe.
Working late.

P.S., I can still smell you on my fingers.

I learned two definitive things
by scouring your computer.

First, there are no recent pictures
of your dad because he's dead.

He OD'd and you were the one
that found him.

You've started a few poems about that day,
but you never finished them.

I'm so sorry, Beck.

But none of this matters because of
my second and greatest discovery.

11:06 a.m., an hour after
our encounter at the bookstore,

amidst a group text on the merits
of vaginal detoxing, you wrote...

Wow. Just met a human male
who actually reads.

Alert the media.

What if it's finally time for me
to date someone good for me?

Thank you for letting me know

I wasn't crazy after all.

No!

Yes, I remember what you said
when you sent money last.

Yes, I'm grateful.

I'm working constantly.
There's no place cheaper to live.

I did.
He basically offered to sleep with me.

No, I can't report him.
That's not how it works.

I'm not worried.
I've seen enough romantic comedies

to know guys like me
are always getting in jams like this.

Not the school, the world.
That's not how the world works.

I know how much you helped me,
it's just... It's hard here, Mom.

Okay. I'll figure it out.

All right. Love you, too.

Bye, Mom.

It's okay, Beck.

Hi, Becks.

Hey, bitch, where you at? Come play!

I can't. I just had the worst day.

-What happened?
-Aw. Beckalicious, whatever it is,

there's nothing that we can't fix, okay?

Yes, us and copious amounts of alcohol.

Oh, my God. There's a sale!

- You guys love me?
- Of course.

- Why would you even say that?
- Okay, then.

Meet me in Greenpoint.

Look, why don't you come here?
Okay? Come here.

It's actually really fun
where we are.

- No.
- I promise.

Yeah.

There's something I need to do for myself.

I'll text you on my way.

See you soon.

-Bye!
-Bye!

Fuck!

I guess we're going
to Greenpoint, Beck.

I never go to Greenpoint.

But the things you do for love, right?

Hi. Um, okay, we're gonna get
a few more drinks.

Hold on, one second.

Guys?

What is she thinking?

Open mics are for models-slash-
singer-songwriters-slash-vegans.

These people don't want to hear

some wannabe read a poem
about the bleakness of life or whatever.

Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the worst.

- Ooh.
- Another round of picklebacks.

Beckish, do we think now's the night?

Positive.

All of my life lately
has been about surviving.

I need to remind myself
why I came here in the first place.

-Yes.
-Yeah.

-You go. So good.
-Who do you keep texting?

I invited Benji.

-Beck...
-What? He likes poetry.

-For sure.
-And he texted he was coming?

He texted a row of smile emojis,
like, 45 minutes ago.

Some guys are assholes,
and you just have to realize that.

I get it, Peach.

You're the one who told me
to keep reminding you he's a bastard.

Up next, we have Guinevere Beck.

Whoo!

-All right.
-All right.

To vulnerability and shit!

Yeah.

-Cheers.
-Okay.

- Okay.
- Okay.

Kill it, Beck!

Hey, everyone. Um, I'm Beck, and I'm...

Not to sound like, you know,
whatever, but just...

I'm a poet.

Yeah, you are!

Whoo!

Yeah, you are!

"One day, you won't need love anymore

One day, you won't walk through the world

As though it was your job
To hold everything up

The sun, the hard part of the night

The secret time when you wake
To the sound of beating

Rise to answer the door
But he's not there

Because that sound is coming
From inside you

And you cannot answer it
No matter how far in you go"

Whoo!

"You loved him the way
Fragile kids love gorgeous bullies

You wrote songs about him. You..."

Uh, I mean...

"You wrote poems about him

You still write poems about him
You're writing one right now"

Why're you so sad?
You're just so sad.

Just something happier, for a change,
might be nice.

I think everyone agrees.
Get the singer back.

Sorry. I just...
I lost my place.

It'll just take a second
to find where I was.

I can't stand seeing this.
I'm sorry. I just can't.

It's obvious what you are.
You're blind with love.

And what you love, writing,
this city, your friends,

most of all, men like Benji,

what all those have in common
is they will never love you back.

While you give everything.

It's crazy the lengths we go.
We're a lot alike, Beck.

Last of the true romantics.

âª Engine
Engine number nine âª

âª On the New York transit line... âª

I was considering this
with my new friend,

Mr. Bat-Shit Homeless Guy,

when the second luckiest thing this week
happened.

Could it really be?

It feels like I'm dreaming.

I'm not.

Beck, you're too drunk to be alone.

What if some sicko
had followed you down here?

And you're too wasted
to be standing so close to the tracks.

Beck! Beck, stop texting that arrogant
club-soda, no-show dickhead.

âª If my train jump off the track âª

You want Benji.

You need Benji.
You hold that phone like it is Benji,

'cause it's your only means
to stay connected.

Forget Benji.

And to hell with that phone.

âª Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up... âª

âª Engine, engine number nine âª

âª On the New York transit line... âª

Hey! Hey!

You okay? Are you all right?
Can you stand up?

Just stay still.

Half that shit down there
can electrocute you, all right,

so just give me your hand.

âª Pick it up! Pick it up! âª

âª Pick it up! Pick it up... âª

Sir, please, shut up!

Give me your hand.

Train's coming.

âª Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up! âª

âª Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up! âª

Your hand! Now!

âª Pick it up! âª

âª Pick it up! âª

Ugh.

-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
-Whoo.

No, it's fine. It's fine.

I, uh, hated... I hated this jacket. Ugh.

-I really am sorry.
-It's okay.

You mind?

Sure, um...

You know what? Let's get you in a cab.
All right?

I'm not always like this.

I figured you had some kind of night.

Some kind of.

Hey, I don't want to sound like a stalker,
but...

I think I know you.

Oh, the... Right.
Of course.

I remember. I'm sorry.

This is what I look like
when I'm sober and have my hair up.

Yeah. No, I... I remember.

It's okay, I have a pretty bland face.

No, you don't.

Yeah, uh, Desperate Characters.
I remember.

Yeah.

Where are you headed?

Village. You anywhere close?

Ride with me. It's the least I can do.

Okay.

Did you move here to be something?
I did. But it's not working out.

And I'm just running around
18 hours a day. Why?

Oh, God! Never mind. Sorry.

No, please. I feel the same way sometimes.

This guy I know, he owns the bookstore.

He once told me that all books
add up to one essential truth.

Which is,
if your IQ is above a certain number...

life is pretty much unbearable.
And the number is not even that high.

I do think
I'd be happier if I was stupider.

But then the world
wouldn't know your poetry.

How'd you know I write poetry?

Doesn't every young writer in New York?

I mean, I read a lot of poetry.

Who do you like?

Strand, Sexton, Merrill...

You're describing my nightstand.

Well, if you read them
to get to sleep every night,

then you definitely belong here.

-What was your last name again?
-Goldberg.

Where did you come from, Joe Goldberg?

I grew up here.

I left for a little while. Chasing a girl.

-But you came back?
-Yeah, I missed it.

And I'm not a good chaser.

Me neither.

Oh, this is, uh... This is me.

Mmm-hmm. It's not bad.

Thank you for sobering me up.

And for saving my life.

No, I didn't...
I didn't save your life.

Yeah, you did.

Oh, God.

Of course.

- Benji.
- Hi.

Um, this is Joe.
He literally saved my life tonight.

I... I fell on the tracks. It was crazy.

Babe, I told you
people are basically good.

It's a great job, bro.

"Bro." You waste of hair.

Okay. Beck, it's freezing out here.

-Wait. Maybe I can get your info...
-Yeah. Um...

Shit!

My phone!

-I must've dropped it in the subway.
-Oh.

Uh, okay, well.
Just maybe give me your number,

for when you get a replacement.

I'm basically enslaved to e-mail.

I get it. Smart. I'm practically
a stranger. Can't be too careful.

Okay.

It's BeckInRealLife@gmail.com

All right.

"Beck in real life."

Thank you.

Here's what I learned this week.

Sorry I didn't make it, you know?

You are special. You're talented.
You're passionate.

You're smart.

Except in the ways you are really not.
Like not locking your phone.

And falling for men like Benji.
You know better, but you can't stop.

Because, well,
because everyone needs someone.

What you really need
is someone to save you.

I can help, Beck.
Let me help you.

Joe.

Pac. Hey.

What's going on?
What're you doing out here?

It's Ron.

He came home drunk.

He started yelling.

Saying I thought I was smart,

reading my books
and looking at him like he's dumb.

What happened? Did he hurt you?

No, he didn't touch me.

I tried to stop him...

-I'm sorry.
-Paco.

Paco, it's okay. Really. It's okay.

You know what? Come with me.
We can fix this together. All right?

So, the first step to fixing something

is to know no matter how destroyed
it seems, it can always be saved.

Books are no exception. You got it?

Got it.

So what we have here is a lying press.
Basically just a huge clamp.

Polyvinyl-acetate glue,

means no acid to burn the pages.
Got your needle, thread,

and finally, right out of Bugs Bunny...

a trusty mallet.

You see this?

We don't need this.

Johno! Listen to this.

"Dear Benji, heard about your soda.

Am interested in including you
on my fall list of must-tries.

Would love to discuss.
Perhaps even try some? Jeff Pevensey."

That's the dude you're always retweeting?

It's the culture guy
from New York magazine.

Hit him back, bro.

No shit. Back off while I think.

Jeff, comma, so nice to hear
from you, bud, period.

Yeah, our sodas are legit, period.

I would love to meet up
to have you try the goods, period.

Let's set something up.

Scrape carefully along the spine.

Of course,
you've got to watch your fingers.

"Sounds great. I can call between meetings
to see if you're available."

This is gonna take us next level.

What time do you think we'll meet?

No offense, we discussed this.

It's best if the product has
one clear face at the beginning.

That's just more me.

Okay, the spine is sewn.

So you take this,
pull it as tight as you can, that way.

Yeah. That's it.

Jeff!

The glue is set. We've applied the binder.

Now...

you gotta be precise,
and use exactly the force needed.

Hey!

Hey, man. Jeff. Nice to meet you, man.

Nice to meet you, too.
Have you been here before?

It's a...
Not a lot of people know about it yet.

It's an incredible after-hours.
Very exclusive.

Yeah, I've been here a couple of times.

-Yeah?
-Hmm.

Oh. Well, good.

So you'll feel right at home, then.

Please, after you.

All right.

It's just down. To the left.

Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

It's 2:00 p.m. when the door chimes,
and I'm ready.

You told your girlfriends you'd come by.
I know this because I have your phone.

- I'll be back.
- Okay.

Hey.

Remember me? From almost dying
on the train tracks?

Uh, it rings a bell. Hang on. Hang on.

I wanted to say thank you.

No. You already did that.

Well, uh, thanks again.

And I'm sorry for, uh, running off
the other night.

-You had a guest.
-Hardly.

So, I got you a present.

No, please.
You don't have to get me anything.

Shut up and just look at it.

"Engine, engine number nine
On the New York transit line

If your girl falls on the track
Pick her up, pick her up, pick her up"

We already have in-jokes.

So...

anyway, that. And I better--

Maybe if you're not too busy,
we could get a drink sometime?

Sure.

Ugh. But I still can't find my phone.

I know. E-mail.

That's right.

See ya, Joe.

See you soon, Beck.

Well played, sir.

Well played.

I'm not always right. I'm human.
I make mistakes.

You'll see.

I have to check on a shipment downstairs.

-Can you watch the register?
-Yeah.

Hell, maybe
I'm just a fool in love...

but I'm right about you,

and I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve, Beck.

Please.

Whatever you think I did,
you got the wrong guy.

No.

I don't.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Everyone just calls me Beck.

And you're Joe...

Goldberg.

A guy needs to protect himself.

And your name
was a glorious place to start.

The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

Professor Leahy.

Professor Obvious wants
to sleep with you.

Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the queen.

How broke are you?

Benjamin J. Ashby.

Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

God, you make me insane.

I think I know you.

Oh, the... Right.
Of course.

You're smart.

Except in the ways you are really not.
Like not locking your phone.

-...we could get a drink sometime?
-Sure.

What you really need
is someone to save you.

Man, I'm thinking maybe...

- Whatever you think I did...
- I can help, Beck.

...you got the wrong guy.

Let me help you.

Tonight's the night, Beck.

Our first date.

It just feels right. Right?

I'm looking forward to it.

And I think, obvious hangover aside,
you are, too.

But I've read people wrong in the past.

One day, I'll tell you about Candace.

Every red flag I was blind to.
How destroyed I was.

What can I say? We all have baggage.

But I feel like
I'm dealing with it the right way.

I'm not bothering you, just checking in.

Hanging with you like this is, admittedly,
honing skills I never knew I'd need.

But hey, handy.

You can't afford new clothes,
but let's be real,

you'd look perfect in a potato sack.

Not a criticism, God knows I am, too,
but you seem distracted.

Of course, a new phone.

Not sure how you went 24 hours
without one.

As you activate your new friend there,

I know you think you're also
deactivating your old one.

But here's where you're wrong.

Your old phone, which I have,
is still logged into the cloud.

And that means I'm still logged into you.

Sci-fi movies are so wrong.
Technology is our friend.

You've reached Benji.
Leave some love. Namaste.

Hey. Look, you haven't texted back.
Just let me know you're okay, okay?

That's all I ask.
This is really annoying, Benji.

It is annoying.

You're not thinking about us,
you're thinking about him.

I kind of thought
I took care of that for you, Beck.

Wanna start off the class
this morning?

Sure.

Good. My last TA was like
a little mouse, afraid of public speaking.

- It's my job.
- Well, lucky us, you're good at it.

So, we're still on for tomorrow?
Drinks, poetry?

Nothing, if not up for both of those.

They came for the big day.
Want me to move 'em down to the basement?

No, I'll do that.
Just get started on the window display.

Hey, I was thinking about making cookies
for hashtag, release day.

Amanda Chantal Bacon has a dope recipe
in Moon Juice Cookbook:

Cook Cosmically
for Body, Beauty, and Consciousness.

- Kill me.
- Sounds great, Ethan.

Oh, and, uh, that kid is back.

Paco?

Hey, speed-reader.

-Hi, Joe.
-What're you reading?

This book about werewolves the girls
in my class won't stop talking about.

It's more about love stuff
than werewolf stuff.

There's... It should be right up here.

Uh, yeah, it's right here. Here, try this.

Frankenstein?

Yeah, the monster is really cool
and scary,

but also not really the monster.

What does that mean?

Just read it, you can tell me.
Ethan's got snacks, hit him up.

Let me the hell out of here!

Now!

Settle down, Benji. Let's talk.

Okay, granted, I didn't think...

...too far ahead
when I swung that mallet.

I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison.

The kind you know is bad,
but can't stop taking.

So I did what I had to do
to help you, Beck.

And now there is an adult human male
in the basement of this bookstore.

Somebody!

The basement's soundproof.

The owner loved to read in peace
down here. I'm sorry.

I told you, I don't know who you are.
I don't know why I'm here. I swear.

Confession: I have no idea
what to do with him now.

I'm gonna give you
my family lawyer's number.

He'll get you paid.

Of course he thinks I want money.

You know who my father is?

Benjamin Ashby II, hedge fund manager?

We have a jet.
We'll send you anywhere in the world.

Best case, that's somewhere
far away from you, Beck.

Worst case, that ends with prison time.
Not an option.

It's a poppy seed bagel. Extra schmear.

Go to hell. I don't eat gluten.

It's an allergy, okay? That shit is real.

Gluten, dairy...
If I ate a peanut, I could die.

Oh, well, gosh,
whatever can I get you?

Just, like, a bare burger
wrapped in chard. Or I could do sushi.

- Sushi?
- My diet is limited.

Please?

Whoever you are, you're not a killer.

Oh, how I wish I was.
This'd be much less complicated.

Let me out of here.
I won't say anything to anyone.

He doesn't even know my name.
I can figure this out.

I'm claustrophobic. My blood sugar's low.

Is this sugar?

I found it in your wallet,

along with three bars of Xanax, Adderall,
half a sheet of, uh, acid, is it?

Whatever. It's not even for me.
I network. I own a business.

That's right. Home Soda.

It's artisanal. It's gonna blow up.

Is it?

Do your investors know you do heroin?

Or, uh, your father?
How about your girlfriend?

I don't have a girlfriend.

Oh, shit!

That's where I know you from.

You were in the cab! Beck's cab!

She, uh... She said your name.
It's Jimmy. No.

This is Joe. He literally saved my life.

It's Joe!

Now, that's a complication.

Do not tell me that you're doing this
because of Beck.

She's not my girlfriend.
You can have her. Take her.

Careful, Benji. Not winning any points.

If you knew her,
you would not be putting me in a cage

and ruining your life
over Guinevere goddamn-Beck!

If you want out, you'll do what I want.

The days of being with a man
who doesn't value you, those are over.

If we can get over the first date hump.

Can't help it, worried about Benji.

That's why it's crucial
Benji's out of your picture.

Please.
He's off getting shitfaced.

Or he's in some kind of trouble.

What we have right now
is just a little spark.

Every choice is a message.

With Candace,
I always felt like I was pushing.

But now I realize... Can't force it.

The timing. The spark.

So, you tell me
if you're too distracted, Beck.

You decide.

Sure. Looking forward.
Free at 6:00.

So, it was just one of those
cheesy diaries with a lock,

but I couldn't stop writing.

I just... I felt better having it all down
on paper, you know?

And then I did this little
creative writing assignment

and it just blew my teacher's mind.

She acted like it was the best thing
she'd ever read...

Honestly, part of me thought
this date would never come,

and now it feels so easy, so right.

This is how our story goes, Beck.

And here I am.

Sometimes you just...
You do things on instinct,

because you have to,
and then you scramble. You know?

Yeah, I kind of know.

I totally didn't google you, but if I did,

I might discover
you aren't on social media?

Fact: It renders you
insanely vulnerable with zero upside.

I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I like real life.

And what about your job?

Bookstore manager
or international super-spy? Which is--

I mean, is that your goal, or...

I know I'm in a city full of people
with big, fat, neon-sign aspirations,

and I know it's not cool to say,
and it's not big and flashy...

but I love books.

And I want my life to be about
what I actually love.

Yeah, I get that.

Uh, sorry,
just a second. Okay?

Yeah, go ahead.

Hey.

Yeah, I know it's serious, Peach.
I'm the one who told you I was worried.

Okay, yes, I'm coming.

I'm sorry, I, uh... I have to go.
This friend, he just...

Apparently he had to go meet someone,
and never came back. It's worrying.

We can pick it up some other time
if you have to...

All right. Thank you.

I hope your friend is okay.

Thought I'd done it.
Gotten Benji out of our way.

Looks like I have to finish the job.

To figure out what to do

with the poster-boy
for white male privilege in the cage,

I need to understand who he truly is.

And to do that,
I need to know what he cares about.

This is totally unfair.

If I knew you were gonna quiz me,

I'd have put more recent books
on the list.

So, bottom line, you've never even read
On the Road.

It's very possible to read a book

without having to read it
in the traditional manner.

You can read about a book.

Yeah, I get it.

You're a fraud.

Give me the stupid book.

I'll read it right now,
you sadistic prick.

Anything to get me out of here.

I do understand
something about you now, Beck.

You somehow think this guy
is all you deserve.

You're looking
a little gray and mealy in there.

Yeah, no shit. You stole my stash!

I thought it wasn't for you.

Fine. You happy? It's mine.

I'm a chipper.

I never do it more than three days
in a row. And I'm quitting.

Okay. Only if you're quitting.

Doesn't work that way.
There's only one way.

Thank you. Thank you.

Just one more thing.

Password?

Leanna.

L-E-A-N-N-A.

His phone lock is
another girl's name, Beck. Jesus Christ!

Well, he's been
living a frankly off-brand life

for a guy who markets health soda.

Based on the evidence,
not missing you when you're gone.

You don't mean anything to him.

Say cheese.

I was worried. I called his mother.
We were about to call the police.

And he's high in some random shitberg
in Massachusetts,

according to his geolocation.

Don't say geolocation.
You're not a stalker.

At least we know he's fine.
Just being the worst.

So we're all gonna go
try that new bar tonight, right? In SoHo.

You are such a lush.

Shit! I can't go. I'm sorry.

I'm supposed to have drinks
with my thesis advisor.

- Ooh!
- Ah!

Ugh! Scale one to ten, how pervy?

He won an award for a book of poems

that probably has 35 references
to, like, vagina lips, so...

Well,
banging your professor is, like,

-a grad-school rite of passage.
-Is it?

Annika's like the Wikipedia page
for sluts.

Whatever! I banged my bio professor.
It was fine. Notably, I passed the class.

You know, eyes on the prize.
Ovary up, girl.

Beck doesn't want to "ovary up."

He controls my status as a TA.
He could knock me out of my housing.

Or, you could not figure it out
and report him.

I think it only works that way
in the movies.

Whatever. We're seeing you tomorrow.

My party?

Tomorrow's the anniversary
of my parents' divorce.

The party I always have
to distract myself.

Of course, sorry. I'm coming.

One more line, man. Come on.

Just tell me your plan,
and I will help you.

Where is she right now?

She's partying her face off
with Lynn and Annika, right?

Actually, she's about to
meet her thesis advisor, but...

glad to hear you take her seriously.

See, this is what I'm telling you.

You see this hardworking writer-chick.

How could you not?

She's branded the living shit
out of herself across the Internet.

I want you to know,
if I wasn't about to be late to see you,

I would beat this guy bloody
for the way he talks about you.

I'm telling you, this is her thing.

Right now, she's got on red lipstick,

and she's getting ready
to work her professor hard for that A.

I'll see you later, Benji.

Hey. Come back. I'm hungry.

There's a directness.
That's what's special about your work.

So if it's not direct to the bone, cut it.

Thanks, that's, um, really helpful.
And coming from you, it means a lot.

A lot of people
find a direct woman irresistible.

You should lean into that
in your life, as well.

Yeah. Um, easier said than done.

Well, you can always practice on me.
I'm safe.

You really have
nothing to be nervous about.

The world is your bright red apple.

You think he writes these lines
in advance? Like a poem?

I wish I had your confidence.

Putting your work out into the world
is a service.

I'll try and remember that.

I wouldn't tell you
if you weren't talented.

I'm happy to share all my secrets.

So, Beck, maybe it's time to acknowledge
what there is here.

Don't touch me.
That's not sexy, it's repulsive.

-Sorry, but this is not--
-You invited me to.

-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you flirt brazenly.

You wear clothes so sheer,
I can see your nipples.

-What do you call that?
-That's crazy.

If you want to stay on the safe side
of the plausible deniability zone,

cover your tits,

stop the blowjob eyes and write better.

I like you,
but clearly you're overworked.

It's only right to release you
from the TA position.

No, no, please.

Get some rest.

You're right to be angry.
Some things can't just be allowed to be.

Something has to be done
about someone like him.

Hello?

Hey, where are you?

I'm in the Village.
Maybe we can, uh, finish our talk?

Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

Are you staring at my lipstick?

No, no. No, I'm not. I'm not.
No, it's just different.

I just... I wanted to try something new,
but you're right, it's not really me.

So, why did you call me?

I don't know. Spontaneous impulse.

It's okay.
You'll learn you can tell me anything.

We cut it short last time because
a friend of yours was missing, right?

Oh, God, he's fine. He's just an idiot.

Agree with you there.

But you want to keep it light.
I can do that.

Okay.
This couple here, coming in the door...

What do you think? First date?

Third. She's not sure
she wants to seal the deal.

Hmm.

And those two?

-Where?
-There.

Brink of divorce.

Oh. That's cold.

Okay.

-Oh, that's easy.
-That's us in 30 years.

And that was way too much.

I love that.

Wow. You're in super good shape
for an old guy.

Thank you! And you,
if I may say, are hot as ever.

But in a dignified, age-appropriate way.

It's all the yoga. It keeps me young.

To be honest, Joe,
I'm so happy that you could come tonight.

It's been the worst day.
My thesis advisor, he made a pass at me.

Huh. You're kidding.

The most embarrassing part is,

I actually thought
he believed in me and my work.

This isn't your fault.

Dumb shit like this happens all the time.

Starting to think I'm some kind of magnet
for dudes with serious issues.

So what are you gonna do?
About your thesis advisor.

I don't know. Get through it.

I believe in you.

Hey, do you want to come to a party
with me tomorrow?

Already booking our next date?

It's at a friend, Peach Salinger's.

Like J.D. Salinger?

-I mean, yes.
-Whoa.

-But she doesn't like to talk about it...
-Wow.

...and she's a sweetheart.

Her family's just a little... You know?

Whose isn't?

Mmm. I like yours better.

Let us give thanks to our lord,
Stephen King, who bestoweth books

so that our bookstores
in third-dimensional locations may live.

It's cool how you get in
the monster's POV.

You understand why he does stuff,
almost like it's, um...

Justified?

Yeah. But then it's weird 'cause he's bad,
but not all bad.

Quick Twitter break from Benj.

I mean, maybe Dr. Frankenstein's
the bad one for even making him, right?

Well, I think it's open
to your interpretation.

We ready?

Let's do it, then.
Release the kraken! Hey!

Come on in. Hey, good morning.

Cookies, homemade. Not just for me.
Get a book.

Thank you so much.
Your receipt is in the book.

Thank you so much.

Whoa. We need another box already.

Ethan, could you watch the register
for a second?

Kid ran down to the basement to get it.

-What? No.
-Yeah. I saw him grab your key.

Paco!

Paco!

What did I say?

-I'm sorry.
-I told you not to come down here.

-I just wanted to grab a book.
-Don't be an idiot.

-Why would you do that? Why?
-I'm sorry.

So, what happened
with you and Professor Vag-lips?

Let's just say I better find a better job,
or some kind of housing, or...

I don't know.

Okay, enough of this shit.

Peach, no, I can't...
I can't accept it. Stop.

Look, it's just first,
last and a deposit, okay?

Don't be so noble, okay?
Just take the check and stop stressing.

Here.

Jesus Christ! If you want to kill me,
what the hell are you waiting for?

Why would I want to kill him?
Who wants to kill people?

Three cups. One is your brand, Home Soda.

It's the best, right?

So prove it. Tell me which one it is.

If I get this right, I get a fix?

If you get this right...

I'll let you out.

-I need a palate cleanser.
-Cup two.

Three.

One, two, or three?

I don't know.

Wait! None of them, okay?

They all taste like stale,
cheap drugstore soda. They're not mine.

They're all yours.

That's bullshit!

Home Soda is, obviously.

Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
You psychopath!

Fine. You win! I lose!

We all lose, 'cause what am I gonna do
with this lying sack of shit, Beck?

You want Beck, right?

Let's be clear. She does not want to be
with a guy like you.

I can help you.

No, actually, she invited me
to a party tonight. To Peach Salinger's.

A Salinger party? Uh, Joe.

She's taking you to add texture.

She wants to seem interesting.
Like she hangs out with real folk.

She's deep. She's an artist.

Truth?

Beck will always leave someone like you
for someone who can take her places.

We never made it to a single party 'cause
she couldn't jump on me fast enough.

She's playing you for a chump,
my friend.

So, yeah, it was really bad.

Basically, food poisoning is the reason
why Peach and I are friends.

Puke does bond you.

She show you her ladle?
She's got this red kitchen ladle.

It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank-me thing.

She's kinky as shit. With me.

Because I'm loaded.
Not you, 'cause who are you?

So, hopefully nothing
gastrointestinal happens,

but I do hope you guys like each other.

You want to change that, you need me.

Shit.

One look and I can tell you,
not my crowd.

What they are
is everything Benji claims you want to be.

Beckalish! Hi.

Hey.

Mwah, mwah.

Thank you.

-Is this Joseph?
-Joe.

Am I just texture here, Beck?

- Now, Joseph--
- Just Joe.

I'm gonna have to borrow our friend here.

So, uh, make yourself at home.
Everyone here is friendly.

Brown people don't bite.

Alumni.

Where'd you go?

I didn't.

- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

Annika Attwater.
Rich and hashtag, carefree,

building a brand
as a body-positive influencer,

which seems to involve wearing
a lot of free stuff on Instagram.

Lynn Lieser.
Publicist. Hashtag, cocktail lover.

Daughter of a surgeon and a tech CEO.

Adopted. Has all the smugness,
none of the angst.

If you have a full set,

each one of them is worth
three times as much for a collector.

You read that one?

Just the first one.

Typical.

You think I need some illiterate
working in my shop?

Hey!

If you want to work in this shop,
you learn the value of these books.

Mr. Mooney, please.

Everything you need is in there.

Let me...

Joseph. There you are.

It's Joe. Just Joe.
This is a lovely collection, Peaches.

It's Peach. And, I mean, you've probably
read more of these books than I have.

A good salesman
has to know his product, right?

So, you met Beck at a bookshop, right?

That's right.

Only in New York.
And then you just happened to meet again.

Casual tone, detective eyes.

Well, it's lucky we did.

She was on the tracks,
at the time.

So I heard. God! Thank goodness for you.

I mean, being in Greenpoint of all places,
at the very right moment.

Oh! It's time for the toast.

So in the time I was in there,
you attract Benji 2.0?

Peach looks thrilled.
Are you thrilled?

What do you want?

So which Beck are you?

The one I see or the one Benji does?

Hey, stranger. How you holding up?
Having fun?

Beck...

Why did you bring me here?

I don't know. I thought it could be fun?

I don't think I have a lot in common
with your other friends.

I like that about you.

I always think I'm gonna
love these things, yet somehow never do.

Then why did we come?

It's been this way since Brown.

It just feels like I'm getting sucked in,
and I could just be me,

yet that somehow never feels
quite good enough.

You know, I stole this dress.
To fit in. Which is pathetic.

I don't know about that.

Not as pathetic as the fact that
Peach wrote me a check to keep me afloat,

which I don't want to cash,
but now I have to.

Look, if you're not one of them,

it's just 'cause stuff didn't
just get handed to you.

-It didn't.
-Right, and when it's like that,

sometimes, to survive...

you have to show some teeth.

And I'm guessing that
yours are pretty sharp.

I'm glad we met. Glad we're friends.

For the love of Christ.

- Joe?
- I know that voice.

Joe Goldberg?

Maddie Johnson. I'm Candace's friend.

Great. Little soon for you
to hear this, Beck, but here we go.

Wow, Maddie, that's crazy.
It's so good to see you.

-Um, this is Beck.
-Hi.

Hey.

So, I heard about you and Candace.

You know, I thought we were pretty happy,

but she thought
she could be happier with...

some guy in Rome, so...
You know, I get it.

She's following her bliss.

It's just how she left so suddenly...

I mean, we were all kind of hurt.

Would you excuse us? My Uber's here.
It was nice to meet you.

I'm sorry. It was good to see you, Maddie.

I just felt like that needed to be over.

Let's get you home.

...be here for Paco.

What could he possibly
need from me...

He needs someone
who isn't drunk, Ron.

How about that?

Geez!

What the hell is wrong with you?
Punching a wall?

You think wrecking the place
is gonna solve our problems?

I'm sorry.

-It's okay.
-It's not okay to yell.

Grown-ups do it all the time.

Grown-ups are assholes.

Some people used to yell at me, too,
you know.

And I don't want to be like them.

I got you something.

I can't take this in the house.

Ron.

So, all the bathrooms in the building
have the same kind of ceiling.

So, go in the bathroom.

The ceiling tiles around the vent
move if you push them.

So you push one, pop the book in there,
slide it closed.

Like a secret hiding place.

Cool.

-Thank you.
-Hmm.

Have a good night, pal.

If you want it, it's here.

You are not responsible
for my feelings, I am.

But for the record, I feel like congealed,
day-old egg rolls right about now.

What was the point of taking me
to that party?

Benji was right.

Benji!

Honestly, I get how he feels.

You left me here to die!
You left me to die!

Enough of this. Just kill me!

Hi.

I, uh...

I just... I want to ask you
to please reconsider.

I need the TA job. I need housing.

Can we, um, maybe discuss placing me
with another advisor?

It's the middle of the term.

I know, um, inconvenient, but it's...
it's really important.

I wish you the best...

but I really can't,
in good conscience, do that.

I understand.

So, I... I guess I'm realizing
I have no choice...

but to share this.

And that is...

Well, it can fit in one tweet.

A list of six women
who have a story about you.

Not hard to find.
Didn't take much asking around.

What's the term again,
harassment or misconduct?

Anyway, they were too scared
to come forward, but then we realized,

it's harder to dismiss seven women
with the same story.

That's not possible.

I've done nothing inappropriate.

You want to make yourself a public liar,
that actually would sink your career.

Blackmail is not something you live down.

You're trying to call my bluff,
but I'm not bluffing.

So, your call.

I've had a lot of time to think
in here.

You're right. I am a fraud.

I've done things worse than you.

And that's how I know.
Joe, you're not a killer.

I'm gonna tell you something,

and once I tell you,

I'll know your worst secret,
and you'll know mine.

Then you can let me go.

He's so shitfaced!

Yeah! He's gonna be a superstar!

Lot of interesting stuff
in Benji's nightstand. But he was right.

The thumb drive
is by far the most interesting.

It started out

your standard-issue frat hazing,
but a certain intensity kicked in.

Blame the coke. Or the homophobia.

Teach this bitch a lesson!
Teach him a lesson!

They all stood there, laughing.

And Benji was the worst,
because he stood there holding the camera.

Dumbass! Wake up, dumbass!

Oh, shit!

Their parents made it go away,
but Benji kept a copy of the video,

I assume to hold over friends' heads.

Instead, I get to hold it over Benji's.

And he doesn't deserve it, but he's right.

It is enough to buy his freedom.

Should I have changed the subject?

On that balcony. Tried to kiss you sooner?

It's not fair,
how easy it is to kill a spark.

It's a miracle love ever happens,
if it's not a myth.

Hi.

Thanks to you,
I showed that professor some teeth.

And?

What's that?

A "thank you" donut.

It worked.

Hmm.

That's good. I'm glad.
I mean, I was worried--

You were right.

And I have housing,
and can rip Peach's check up,

and generally live to fight another day.

And I wouldn't have had the guts
if you hadn't...

So, really, thank you.

All I want to do is help, Beck.

I mean, you saw something in me, and God,

not everyone gets why I'm here,
and what being a writer means.

It's the most... I mean,
it's the only important thing, and...

you helped me to not lose it.

Aren't you gonna look?

See if I guessed the right flavor?

No bullshit. Classic.

Even, old-school, and secretly better than
all those crazy, trying-too-hard ones.

It is nice to be seen.

It's a good guess.

It's good.

Come back here.

So, plain glazed a yes.

Noted.

I have to go to class.

Have a good class, Beck.

Did you get it? The video?

Maple latte, almond milk, two stevia.
Did I get that right?

Yeah. Yeah, I saw the video.

Yes, yes, yes!

Oh!
Mutually assured destruction.

Let's talk about something first, though.

What you said about Beck
basically being a gold digger?

I was just being honest, that's all.

What you are is wrong.

I'd go so far as to say
you create the problem

when you assume this stuff,
when you treat her like trash.

You cast her in a role that isn't her,
and you trap her in it.

Bro, I'm done with her!

Say I can trust you.

I've got the video, right?
I mean, a solid maybe.

The thing is, that doesn't make up
for the damage you've done.

I'm sorry.

If it was between me and you, Benji,
honestly, I would roll the dice.

I would.

Like you said, I'm not a killer...

but this is about her.

I'm telling you.

I'm scared. I'm very scared
of what you would do to her.

Maple almond latte...

two stevia, two tablespoons of peanut oil.

Could've gone either way.

He's lied about so many things.

Who knew? The peanut allergy was real.

I guess Benji's gonna die an honest man.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Everyone just calls me Beck.

And you're Joe?

Goldberg.

A guy needs to protect himself.

And your name
was a glorious place to start.

The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

-...we could get a drink sometime?
-Sure.

Hey. Let me up.

God, you make me insane.

Beck, who is this?

Benjamin J. Ashby.
Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

-After you.
-All right.

Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

Do not tell me that you're doing this
because of Beck.

I'm very scared
of what you would do to her.

She show you her ladle?
She's got this red kitchen ladle.

It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank-me thing.

Benji, I'd love your help.

Unfortunately, I know
you're a pathological liar.

I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison.

So I did what I had to do to help you.

It's been three days
since our first kiss.

I have to say, things are looking
pretty good for us, post-Benji.

If you could only watch one movie
for the rest of your life,

-what would it be?
-Beverly Hills Cop.

-Really?
-Yeah, dead serious.

Okay, I'll bite. Enlighten me.

Well, it's funny,
but the danger feels very real.

It checks all the boxes.

-What's yours? What's your forever movie?
-Mmm.

I have to go with Pretty in Pink.

Invisible townie girl
swept off her feet

by the one guy who really sees her?

It's a little on the nose, Beck.

I love that movie.

I'll be that guy. The one who sees you.
You deserve that after Benji.

So...

your old girlfriend,

that girl at Peach's party
was talking about,

Candace, is it?

It's customary,
the inventory of past heartbreak.

- Do I want to know?
- But Candace.

I'm not sure
how to tell you about her yet.

It's too soon, Beck.

I mean, I'm an open book.
But it's the old story.

Just thinking you're right for someone,

and you're not.

Hmm. I got about a dozen of those.

-Hmm.
-Maybe sometime over a drink.

Or ten.

-Yeah.
-Ten?

Ten. Ten, give or take.

I want to come in. I do.
But I'm gonna make us wait.

You're worth waiting for. Besides...

Bye.

Right now, I have something
rather pressing to deal with.

"Grab and go"? Really?
"Townie pie"? What the...

You're dead to me, Benji. Dead.

You're finally moving on.

And now that you've dealt with Benji,
it's time for me to do the same.

How exactly does one get rid of a body?

I can't just google this kind of thing

without creating
a pretty damning evidence trail.

So, I turn to those I trust most for tips.
King, Carr, Franzen, Flynn.

Fun fact: spatchcocking a chicken
and dismembering a human

involve the same six essential steps.

Not sure I'm down for that.
Little intense.

But I think I finally have a plan
for Benji.

Hey, Joe. I didn't know you were up there.

Do you mind
if I play some Enrique Iglesias?

I'm trying to bone up on my Spanish.

- Officially the darkest days...
- Sounds great.

-...in the world's history.
-I could pick something else.

I got a ton of playlists on here.
I got rock music, club music, jazz music.

I wonder if he's a virgin.

Stick with the Iglesias.

I'll be in the basement
working on some books.

I don't want to be disturbed. All right?

No problem. Thanks, Joe.

Here's what I know.

There can be no dead Benji
for you to mourn.

He needs to disappear.

Already handled the optics
on social media.

Portrait of a dude
hard-partying his way off the grid.

As for the body,

cremation seems expedient.

This will require chemicals,
a steady blaze,

and absolutely no dental records.

Yeah. It looks like I'm gonna need to
slow the biological roll on Benji.

It's about temperature
and it's about humidity.

And dropping the temp this low
puts the books at risk.

Dry, brittle, lost forever.

My humidifiers won't let that happen.

Gertrude Stein is dead.
She's not coming back to sign books.

Hopefully, this holds him
until I can man up and do the deed.

Come in.

Hi, there. I'm Guinevere Beck.

I'm your new MFA transfer.

Professor Leahy and I agreed
that it would be better...

Sorry. I'm looking for Professor Mott?

Beck, is it?

-Yes. Hi.
-Blythe.

-I heard you were joining us.
-Oh. Yeah.

We meet here for workshop
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Mott's no Leahy, though,
so bring your A game.

I intend to. You know, I actually...

I read one of your essays
in the Review last month,

and it was so illuminating.
I mean, I tweeted it.

Social media.
It's like the next great genocide.

Jersey, right?

-Sorry?
-That's where you're from?

No, I'm from Nantucket.

Oh, interesting.

-Where are you from?
-Such a tough question.

Um, I was born in Papua New Guinea,

but my dad worked
for the State Department,

so we moved around a lot.

I actually separated from my parents
at one point.

Did some modeling in Tokyo.

My hair's super unique there.

I'm sorry.
It's my grandparents.

I'll see you in class, okay?

- Okay.
- Okay.

Hey. Yeah?

And then she walked away,
and I melted into the earth.

Sounds like a pretentious bitch,
if you ask me.

No. Blythe's amazing.

She wrote this piece
about how she and her mother

got bulimia together while in Italy.
And she was 12.

- Chic.
- What the... Is that a nose?

It's a dick pic, Annika.

-See? Look. It's just zoomed in.
-No. No.

Why is it against shag carpet?

- I don't know. Perspective?
- I don't get it.

I mean, why do men think
disembodied members equal foreplay?

-They're not aesthetically pleasing.
-Ooh, I disagree.

I have over 200 saved on my phone,
organized by category.

It's my Guggenheim.

I got fat bats, boomerangs, banana boats,

late bloomers and Jewish guys.

More power to 'em,

but your friends kind of treat sex
like it means nothing.

Junk in zoom.

- But you're different, aren't you?
- Why am I not surprised?

Honestly, I see her point.
I hooked up with some guy last night.

Knee-deep in before I realize
he's uncircumcised.

It kind of looked like,
I don't know, a hoodie?

- Whoa!
- Bookstore clerk has a turtleneck?

Bookstore manager. But no, not Joe.

Some guy from Tinder.
Just a little down and dirty, you know?

- Wow.
- Joe is still a maybe.

A "maybe"? I'm a "maybe"?

And you're still screwing other guys?
Beck!

How did I miss this?
How did I read this so completely wrong?

Look, if you want
to bone Benji out of your system,

more power to you.

I just want to make sure
that you're respecting yourself.

Look, I'm just saying...

are you being
your most amazing self right now?

I mean, this is... This is my process.

It's like a Benji exorcism.

I'm just exploring my options
in a city of eight million people.

-It's only reasonable, right?
-Yeah.

I'm gonna get a drink.

I like your tattoo.

I don't have a tattoo.

Love is patient and kind.
And so am I, Beck.

For you, I can be patient.
Maybe this is your process.

Nobody buys the first pair of jeans
they try on, no matter how perfect.

But as much as I'm hoping
this is just a stage,

a quick password search
on your iCloud has revealed

a swipe-fest of millennial man-boys.

Guy with tiger.
Junior William Morris agent.

Viking wannabe.
You've been a busy girl, Beck.

It's more competition than I realized.

This thing between us, it's new, tenuous.
And the cost was a corpse.

But I can't get rid of every guy
in New York.

If I want to win your heart,
I'm gonna have to show you.

I'm not a "maybe." I'm the one.

It's time.

Time to get rid of Benji, so I can focus
my undivided attention on you, Beck.

On us.

So, I'm gonna need a few supplies.

Hey, Joe. You said you needed to talk?

I do, yeah. So, here's the thing.

I have a secret project I'm working on,
but I got to open up the shop.

So, I thought you could
run some errands for me.

I'll give you a little money for books?
Just between us.

Yeah. No problem. Between us.
What do you need?

Well, you might have to run
to a few different places.

You can count on me, Joe.

Thanks, Pac.

"The swine and I

Eye to eye

My heart is his

And that was sunset"

I'm not sure it had the vigilance or depth
that you're capable of.

I just wasn't fully invested.

Interesting, Blythe.

How do we maintain the reader's attention?

We infuse the universal
with painful specificity.

- Or they simply turn the page.
- Exactly.

My worst fear, and I'm not commenting
on Yuri's poem, per se,

is not to be bad, but unremarkable.

Unremarkable. That is the fear.

I hope this was helpful, Yuri?

I think that does it for today.

Next up is Blythe. And Beck.

Send a piece of your choosing
to myself and your fellow classmates,

and we'll review on Thursday.

Okay.

Here's what I've gleaned from
this little exercise in futility, Beck.

You're in no mood to write.

And you need a new bed.

So, hey, maybe your enthusiastic
but ultimately empty encounter

with that Warby Parker-wearing mixologist
could work to our advantage.

I've got time to kill
while Paco's shopping.

You read my mind.

But I have to play this perfectly.

And in order to do that,
I got to break out the big gun.

Mr. Mooney's Buick Skylark.

You bound down the stairs in those tight,
not-too-tight jeans.

You're in flip-flops
and your toenails sparkle,

and your hair is in a bun,

and at least you don't have any hickies,
so there's that.

Oh, my God!
I can't believe this is your car!

Uh, you're a life-saver.

You have no idea
how much I need a new bed.

New challenge.

How do I segue this
from browsing glassware

to, "Holy shit! Joe's the one"?

Weird.

I have one just like this.

Yeah, I know all about it.
Benji told me.

It was my dad's.

The infamous red ladle.
How you like to be spanked with it.

Is that what you really want, Beck?

Is that the guy you're looking for?

Just pick one.

It's all cut
from the same hunk of over-priced wood.

I can't decide.

People trying to buy
some sort of meaning in their lives

with $60 candles and sustainable lamps.

I mean, they all look pretty good to me.

No. I just mean, should I get the queen-
or the king-sized bed?

Your bedroom isn't big enough
to fit a king.

You're right. It's too...

How do you know that?

It's New York. No one's bedroom
is big enough to fit a king.

What's wrong?

This girl, Blythe, in workshop.
She just submitted her short story.

And?

And I haven't even started mine,
and it's due tomorrow.

God.

Hers...

It's brilliant.

It's about a crow
that flies into a woman's house,

runs into the walls
and leaves blood everywhere.

That sounds terrible.

Read it.

Well?

You might be right.

I know.

Can I ask you something?

Anything.

Promise to tell the truth?

Scout's honor.

Do you think I'm unremarkable?

Unremarkable people don't worry
about being unremarkable.

This is it, Beck.
This is the moment.

I'm gonna show you
just how remarkable you are.

You want it down and dirty? You got it.

- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What? I thought that you...

That I wanted to get arrested

for you going all bush diver on me
in public?

It's not exactly on my to-do list today.

I guess I read that wrong.

You haven't made eye contact
for the past ten minutes.

Things couldn't get any worse right now.

Hello?

Hey, Joe. It's Ethan.

-Ethan from the bookstore.
-Yeah.

Yeah, I know who you are, Ethan.

Right. Thing is, the power's out.

Um, the electrician says
he thinks the system is overloaded,

but he can't
get to the fuse box because...

It's in the basement
with a dead body.

...which is locked.

He thinks he can pop the lock,
but I just wanted to, you know...

No! No, no, no.

Just tell the electrician to go home.
I'll call him later.

You lock up and go home.

I'll deal with it when I get back,
all right?

Okay.

Everything okay?

Yeah, it's fine.
It's just a little problem at the shop.

I should get you home.

I was afraid this might happen.
Six humidifiers

and an AC unit from the late '70s
cranked to its lowest setting.

Even in death,
Benji is a colossal pain in my ass.

Okay. With the AC out,

seems deterioration speed's
really picked up.

Oh!

Is that ooze?

Things have grown biologically dire
in the Benji department.

Also, the rare book department.

But I can't protect them
until I get rid of him.

Benji has to go.

Hey, what're you up to?

Do you happen to read Chinese?

Or own a mallet?

The books are safe.
Basement is 100% corpse-free.

Can't burn the body
in the daylight, anyway.

So, the least Benji can do
is wait in the car for a little while.

- All right. Ready for that.
- Ready? Okay.

Okay, let go for a second.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

- It's in the peg!
- Okay.

- Hand me the mallet.
- Yeah.

Should be good.

- Can you do that? That's perfect.
- Ready?

There it is! Go!

Say when.

When. When. When.

Cheers to us.

You make a good apprentice.

I was gonna say the same thing about you.

I'm sorry about earlier.
I didn't mean to get so upset.

It's okay.

No. It's not. It's just...

I don't want you to think of me like that.

I like you, Joe.

Like, actually like.

And I was a little in my head,
to be honest.

Blythe's short story
kind of threw me for a loop.

It's not a competition.

I know, but I wonder...

Am I ever gonna write anything
that amazing?

-You're talented.
-You don't know that.

I know you need to get out of your head.

Forget Blythe. This Blythe person.

Forget everybody.
Just write what you want.

God. Everyone says that like it's so easy.

I know. I know. Okay, so...

Pop quiz.

Don't think.

-Just answer.
-Okay.

What hits you like a gut punch,
when you... The first thought.

My dad.

Before he...

Yeah, right.

Of course.

He was an addict.

It was hard.

And scary.

I mean, there were good days, too.

Like, I always knew
it was gonna be one of those

when I woke up
to the smell of pancakes cooking.

He used this red ladle
to scoop up the batter.

This is the red ladle story?

And I would be laughing,
singing along to some bad Top 40 song.

When everything would be right.

But then he'd go out and...

the ladle would go back in the drawer...

and I'd wait for the next good day.

Until there weren't any more.

Wow.

I did not expect to say all that.

I think you're right.

You definitely don't have
anything meaningful to write about.

Ooh!

Benji was wrong about all of it.

His whole red ladle story.
You don't want to be spanked.

You want to feel safe. Loved.

You want someone to make pancakes for you.

Here.

Um... Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

Coming!

- Is everything okay?
- No.

- Thank God you're here.
- Peach.

- I texted you.
- I should've known.

I'm having a really bad flare-up.

I think I need you to take me
to the emergency room.

Oh, Joseph. Didn't realize you were here.

I told you he was coming.

Peach is really sick.

I mean, this is probably more
than you need to know,

but I have a rare chronic bladder disease
called interstitial cystitis.

Gosh!

I mean, you know,
some people think I'm being uppity,

but I can't have any fast food.

And if I drink, it has to be a high pH,

you know, like Ketel One,
or Goose and pear juice.

Weren't you doing JÃ¤ger shots
at your party?

- Let's get you to the hospital.
- Yeah.

Joe has a car. He can take us.
Right, Joe? You can take us?

Of course.

I mean, I've got a dead body in the
trunk, but, hey, no biggie, right?

This is taking forever.

He took the worst street
to get across town.

Be nice.

I'm in real pain.

I'm sorry.

- Joseph.
- Yeah.

I'm feeling nauseated.
Can you crack a window?

There's like a sort of putrid aroma
that keeps wafting in the back seat.

What can I say? Smells of the city.

Oh, God. I can't deal. I can't deal!

We'll walk. Need to get out of this.

I'm so sorry.

It's almost the witching hour.

Grab the supplies,
drive the narcissistic cadaver,

formerly known as Benji,
to his final destination,

light a match,
and I'm yours forever, Beck.

Well, this is a development.

That's him.

"Potassium nitrate.
Six rolls of duct tape.

Fire starter. Twine. Burlap. Wood stakes."

You want to explain what all this is for?

Explain the shopping list straight
out of Body Disposal for Dummies?

I know.

I know how this all must look.

I know involving Paco
was the wrong thing to do,

but things have been
a little crazy for me lately.

I guess I was hoping
I could make the world a better place.

You know what?
It would just be easier if I show you.

Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

Technically, we're not allowed
to plant anything in here.

I was just trying to keep it
a bit under wraps.

And the chemicals?

They dissolve roots.

Fire starter?

I like to grill.

Here.

There you go.

-It's good.
-Thank you.

So, he built a garden. So what?

I told this guy,
stay away from my girlfriend's kid.

And what does he do? He gives him money?
For errands?

Hey, I told you,
I'm a parole officer, okay?

We see guys like this all the time.
He is a sicko. I feel it in my gut.

Will you go back inside?

Just tell your mom
I'm gonna be right there, okay, buddy?

All right. All right. All right.

The kid's got ADHD.
Tough to manage at times.

But that's what makes him vulnerable
to freaks like this.

Look, I apologize if I crossed a line.

I just noticed how hungry
Paco is all the time, you know?

I gave him a few dollars
to go to the store,

honestly, so he could
buy himself a sandwich.

I lend him books from time to time, too.
That's all.

He just seems a little neglected.

Are you kidding me right now?

I'm not saying they're unfit.
A lot of people drink.

-That's it! I--
-All right! All right!

Sorry to have taken up your time.

Good luck with the garden.

Thank you, Officer.

People. They're easy to fool.

Like these cops.

I'm the nice, straight-edge guy,
so there's nothin' to worry about.

People believe
whatever supports their worldview.

Unfortunately, that seems to
include you, Beck.

You believed you deserved Benji
and his neglect.

And you believe you deserve Peach
and her drama. And on and on.

I want to call and tell you, but I can't,

because there's
a traditional waiting period

between every goddamn communication
when you're trying to date someone.

I hate this generation.

Thank you.

Thanks for staying with me.

Honestly, I don't know
what I would've done without you.

You can always count on me.

Thanks.

So, what do you think about Joe?

Uh... Yeah, you know, I like him.

I think I might really like him.

I mean, I wasn't sure if I was ready
to get involved, but maybe...

Okay, you can't be serious.

I mean, the guy works at a bookstore.

Beck. Look, I know you.

You don't want to spend
your fifth anniversary

going dutch at Katz's Deli.

You need someone to take care of you.

So you can write, be free, happy.

Not someone like Joe
and his financial limitations.

That is not fair.

Nobody pays me to be fair.

What do you say we get a bite to eat?
'Cause I'm starving.

I think I better skip it.

I should really get home.
Glad you're feeling better.

Oh, no, no, no. Not now.

Okay, Beck, all right.

Hey. How's the patient?

Better. Thanks for the ride.

The doctor said it was good
that we came when we did.

Oh, yeah?

Why don't you meet me back at my place?
Maybe we can pick up where we left off?

What about Peach?

-What about her?
-Where is she now?

Indochine. It's her comfort food.

Perfect. Peach is gulping steamed
Chilean sea bass down her scrawny gullet,

and I'm about to get caught.

So, what do you think?

I think you complain
about not being able to write,

but then you, you know, drop everything
for some medical emergency,

which, by the way, many believe
to be psychosomatic in origin.

I meant about you coming over.

I wish I could. I really wish I could,

but I'm just really busy right now,
so, in fact, I should go.

Look, I know Peach showing up
was bad timing,

but I wasn't exactly writing
when she showed up.

-No, I know.
-Pro tip of the day.

Screen your calls
when you're trying to burn a body,

because it turns out, things slip out
that you didn't actually want to say.

...but, you know, you're sending
some mixed messages, right?

What is that supposed to mean?

I'm trying to do what you want,
but I can't tell what that is.

Like, build you a bed,
be with you on the bed,

drop you down the block

because your friend is asking,
and not very...

Seriously, Joe, shut up.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

But...

Hey! How's it going?

Good. That's one hell of a bonfire.

Yeah. What can I say?
I went a little crazy.

You know,
you're welcome to join if you like.

Please say no. Please say no.

That would be great.

But we need to get back to the car
before it gets any darker. Good luck.

-Yeah, have a good one.
-You, too.

I believe in love at first sight.
I had it with you, Beck.

And maybe, just maybe,
I destroyed it just as fast

in the space of a single phone call.

Was all this for nothing?

How may we describe
the joy of the king and queen

when they saw their daughter...

I've been calling you, Beck.

But straight to voicemail.

Worst three words in the English language.

I wonder what our kids would've been like.

They'd have grown up reading,
not glued to iPads.

And we definitely wouldn't have named them

things like Gulliver, or Blaze
or Mysti with an "I."

We would've crushed this. Together.

It wasn't supposed to end like this.

Call me back, Beck.

The end.

I don't mean this
to blow smoke up your ass or anything,

but your writing makes me think
that Raymond Carver has been reincarnated.

That is so kind of you
to say, Tomas.

I was born in '88, the year he died,

so weirdly enough, you're not
the first person to have said that.

Again, great work, Blythe.
Excited to see what's next.

Beck, we weren't expecting you.
You didn't send along pages.

I know. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry I'm late, it's just...

I wrote them, but they sounded super emo.

So I ripped them up and started over,
and I lost track of time.

But this feels like me
and what I want to say.

It's only one page, but...

That isn't really enough
for us to critique.

Are we supposed to read it now?
In front of you? That's kind of awkward.

If that's the case,
I should warn you,

I have this facial autism thing
where I can't hide what I'm thinking.

Let's just reschedule your review
for another time.

Beck?

Hey.

Uh, okay, so I hate to admit it,
but you were right.

A little bit.

I will do anything for my friends.
And do I hide behind them? Yeah.

And do I use them as an excuse
not to write?

Honestly, I'd use anything
as an excuse not to write because...

Okay, I'm afraid I might fail.

I'm one terrible page away from confirming
I'm the worst writer in history.

All of that to say,
if I'm sending mixed messages,

it's because I don't know who I am.

So how am I supposed to know what I want?

And I know I sound super gross,
like, so, I don't know, millennial.

Don't say anything.

In this moment, you are everything.

Here's the thing. If you know who you are,
it's not like you share it.

I mean, you're a nice guy
with the "you're remarkable" stuff,

and feelings guy
with the "write what moves you,"

but then, you try and go down on me
in the middle of a furniture store.

If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were hiding something.

For God's sakes,
why are you holding a Pendleton blanket?

I've never even seen your place,

and you never talk
about any of your friends.

I mean, who are you?

Okay, that was too much.

Um... It sounded better in my head.

I want to show you something.

You want to know me, Beck?

I'll show you exactly who I am.

This is where we keep the rarest books.

The collectibles. First editions.

It's paper, cloth, leather, paste.
It's all vulnerable.

All sensitive to light,
humidity, temperature.

That's why they need to be in here.

To protect them.

I can take you to my apartment.
Any time you want.

I want you to meet my friends. I do.
But this...

this right here, is the most
important place in the world to me.

As weird as it sounds.

These books are more alive,

more worthy than most people I know.

You want to know who I am? This is it.

There you are.

That's it. I am officially
out of the Tinder business.

-Bravo, honey.
-I just...

I feel like this is a good step, you know?

Like, this is good for me.

Joe is good for me.

Whatever you need, Becks.

I'm just saying,
and I mean this, honestly...

Maybe a simple life isn't so bad.
Maybe it's what you need.

Maybe I should be looking for that.

Joe isn't simple. He's different.

Complicated.

That's funny. There's a book missing.

Really? What book is that?

Ozma of Oz. No, it was just here.

Joe was looking at it at my party.

I'm sure it'll turn up.

You've deleted Tinder.

And now you've called
and asked me to come over.

My faith in our epic love story
is officially restored.

I'm sorry, Joe. I was so stupid.

I left your list on my bed,
and Ron found it. I'm sorry.

You're not stupid. It's not your fault.

I tried to explain, but...

It's not your fault.

Guys like Ron are bullies.

We just need to stay
one step ahead of them.

Like the Musketeers. Always one step ahead
of the Cardinal, right?

Hmm.

"One for all."

"And all for one."

Paco!

Get inside.

I can smell the bourbon from here.

I told you. Leave the kid alone.

Look, you may have the cops fooled
with your bullshit tomato garden.

But I'm right.

There's something wrong with you.

I see it in your eyes.

File that away under
"future problems."

Knock, knock. You here yet?

Because tonight...

Tonight, I show you I'm the one.

You can make me pancakes later.

Did you just...

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

There are no recent pictures
of your dad because he's dead.

He OD'd and you were the one
that found him.

You've started a few poems about that day,
but you never finished them.

I have one just like this.

It was my dad's.

This is the red ladle story?

It's okay, Beck.

I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve.

You fall for the wrong men.

You have questionable taste in friends,
and that Peach is the worst.

I just need to know who you really are.

Besides a broke poetry student

in a subsidized apartment
you could never afford.

What you really need
is someone to save you.

Let me help you, Beck.

Beck, is it? Blythe.

I read one of your essays
in the Review last month,

and it was so illuminating.

That's funny. There's a book missing.

Joe was looking at it at my party.

Tonight, I show you I'm the one.

You want it down and dirty? You got it.

Did you just...

Did you just...

What was that?

Eight seconds?

Oh, yeah. He's got that
"Trump just took Pennsylvania" look.

Say something.

Say, "Happens all the time. NBD."

No, you'll sound like a slut.

You could say, "Let's order food."
Move past it.

Is Grey Dog open late?

Oh, thank God.

Um...

-I should...
-Yeah, yeah.

Shit.

Ugh, you idiot.

Why did you tell him
you were available this weekend?

Why don't you think?

Well, go.

The Captain calls, you answer.

You know how this works.

He paid for the bed you just got laid on.

Or whatever that was.

And your phone bill.

Good girl. That wasn't so hard, was it?

Seriously?

Seriously?

Hey, Beck,
I'm gonna run to the store.

Shit. Joe. Probably thinks
you're hiding in here.

Hold on a second. I'll be right out.

Oh, God, please stop.

They're just words, Beck.

Tell him what he wants to hear.

Oh, no.

Joe?

Ugh, Beck. You're a disaster.

Last night, eight-second sex. Joe.

If you're gonna act like a whore,
may as well look like one.

You just have a magic poon.

Hashtag, yoni too good.

Thanks. That's helpful.

Is he big?

"Is he big?" Oh, my God.
Why are you even asking them?

Can you, for once,
just have your own opinion, Beck?

Got pics?

With the bun?

You're not helping.

Is he worth it?

"Is he worth it?"

There we go. Good question.

Is he?

Annika wouldn't know a good dick
if you hit her over the head with it.

It's not like it doesn't happen
to tons of guys.

I mean, Benji used to nod off
while going down on me.

I thought we weren't talking
about Benji anymore.

We're not.

He's dead to me.
Just merely using him as a reference.

Benji didn't work retail.

Joe works in a bookstore.

A hop, skip, and a bad haircut away

from selling men's leather bracelets
at Club Monaco.

Becks, love yourself. Ghost him, already.

Sorry to interrupt, ladies,
but we are all clear.

- Are you saying I don't have bedbugs?
- I didn't find a one.

Would you like to see
the 22 bites on my ass?

- Uh...
- Don't answer that.

They're there. Go find them.

Go find them!

Ugh. I wonder how he is
with finding rare books.

Joe did not take your Wizard of Oz.

Ozma of Oz.

And who said anything about Joe?

That's it. I'm booking a room
at the Mandarin Oriental

and you're coming with.

I would so love to, but I can't.

I, um...

I am going to a writer's retreat
in Rockland.

Since when?

She knows when you're lying.

Since I wrote this piece in workshop
that everyone called "treacly."

Tell me you're not writing
another dead puppy thing

as a metaphor for your dad dying.

-I--
-What?

That's completely what it's really about.

Look, I'm just saying
stop killing puppies.

Write fresh.

You know, there's so much more
inside of you.

Who are you now, Beckalish?

-Hmm?
-I thought it was a good piece.

Aw...

Sorry, boo-boo. Okay, go.

Find that brilliant badass
inside of you, and believe in her.

I know I do.

Literally, the most supportive
she's ever been about your writing,

and you're lying to her face.

You are the worst friend.

Oh, there they are.

Wait a minute. Why do you need these
if you're going on a writer's retreat?

What?
So, it's look hot or be a writer?

You could just leave.
You could, you know.

Cut the cord. Take off the yoke.
Bon voyage, Captain.

You're a coward.

Britney got through 2007, though, right?

Maybe this is what you need
to find your inner badass.

Maybe Emily Dickinson had it right.

The solitary prowess of a silent life.

What is it with motel rooms
and you wanting to dive into your panties?

He is always late.
And you're frustrated.

Plus, after last night, you're owed one.

Oh, Joe. You seriously need to call him.

Has he been working out?

It's two days. You got this.

Did you just...

You should be screaming
my name right now,

digging your nails into my back.

You expected me to please you,
get you off,

but you didn't scream,
and my back is not bleeding,

and you definitely did not get off.

You don't even know what to say, do you?

You must be mortified.

Ignore it. Ignore it, Beck.

What the hell have I done?

Seriously?

You're already telling
whoever that is.

I've reduced myself to an anecdote.

Mr. Quickdraw. The Minuteman.

Being generous.

Don't let it be Peach.

"The Captain"?

What the hell is this?

What? Obviously, you don't love him.

Love ya!

"Love ya."

"Love ya"?

You never said that to Benji,
and look what had to happen to him.

Beck, just when I think
we're getting somewhere...

Yeah, so, here,
you're sacrificing the hard cover,

but you're getting greater textual
accuracy than any previous edition.

It's the final word
on the Tolkien trilogy.

Thank you so much.

My dick reduced
to cartoon food items.

This is my nightmare. A hot dog.

Yes, with the bun.

Tell her, Beck.

Go on, listen to your gut.

Joe's the one.

Yes. Worth it. Okay, one more shot.

Not like there was any real doubt.

"Outfit"? Are you kidding me?

Just got it. Hope you like.

You do all this for him?

Christoph's party
in Montauk tonight. You in?

Can't. Gotta write.

You even lie to your friends
about this guy. What the hell?

You've been confirmed
at the Seahorse Motel.

Ethan, I need you to close tonight.

Oh, man, I'd love to,
but I gotta split soon.

Rastiche, my balalaika teacher,
is holding a master class tonight.

Wasn't a question.

I'm sorry.
I have an appointment out of town.

Beck, I should be your Captain.

It can't be.

How old is he?

If only I could tell you I'm here.
You don't need to do this.

Whatever this is,
it's not too late to stop it.

-So good to see you, hon.
-Yeah. You, too, Dad.

"Dad"?

Place belongs to a couple
from church.

There are plenty of rooms,
and it's ours right through New Years.

Sounds like a pretty cool place.

Even has a hot tub out on the patio.

Though, if I know Nancy,
she won't let the kids near it.

She doesn't normally want the kids
near me, either, but here we are.

I really think
you'd love it up there, honey.

Yeah, um...

I don't know my schedule
that far out, unfortunately.

Of course, I...

I understand.

And you wonder
why he asks for more.

Um...

But I'll totally check,
and I'll let you know as soon as possible.

What? Is it too much
for a Dickens festival?

No, no.

I mean...

It's just, some people may find it...
You know?

How is Nancy?

Why is he your secret, Beck?

"...has only one fault that I know of.

And it happens, unfortunately, that
that single blemish is a want of taste.

She don't like me."

It's pretty great, huh, sweetie?

Yeah, it's amazing.

Amazing this many people are fans
of contrived plotting and melodrama,

if they even read Dickens.

More likely they couldn't pass up
an excuse to day-drink.

How's your mom?

Um... she's actually... She's on a cruise,
but she's great.

Riddled with anxiety, low self-esteem,
on antidepressants,

dating men so safe and boring
she must wanna scream, but don't worry.

You abandoning her didn't scar her at all.

How about your brother?
How's he doing?

You know. Works a lot. Anya, too.

But they seem happy.

According to Facebook.

And how's school goin'?

It's great, actually. I'm...

I'm just working on building my portfolio.

It's more than just that first book.

You really need the second if--

Hey, where are you guys?

Beck, you're such an asshole.

"Love me, Daddy.
I'm gonna be a writer, Daddy."

God, just shut up forever.

There they are.

Oh, my God.

She's actually gotten more smug.

Beck, look, I have a cane.

Yes, you do. Look at you guys.

You look pretty.

Stop hating them.
They're just kids.

None of it's their fault.

Thanks, Mia. So do you.

Guinevere, how are you?

Great. I love your dress.

Not necessarily you in it, but...

Brought you something.

I just couldn't resist.

- No, she's not.
- Oh...

Oh, it's perfect.
Oh, um...

You're slipping a bit, dear.

Touch me again, crazy-pants.
I dare you.

Thank you.

Hey, Nancy, let's take the kids
and play a game.

As long as I get to...

You really are capable
of keeping a secret.

Four, by my count.

Who the hell are you, Beck?

Have at it.

Hey! Yeah. You're a natural.

Two down, buddy.

What an arm on him.

Maybe you should
get a shot for the blog.

If I wasn't so blinded by love,

I would've seen these secrets
right in front of me,

waiting to be uncovered.

Captain Beck, a.k.a. The Captain,
a.k.a. Edward Martin Beck.

The addict part was true, I see,
but he never died,

which he credits to his friends
in the NA fellowship at St. James Church.

It was there he not only
conquered his demons,

but also met church rep
and divorcÃ©e Nancy Whitesell,

a.k.a. the Christian News'
"Mommy Blogger of the Year."

"If Ned can do it, so can you."

He became a feature in her blog,
then her life.

Less than a year, they were married.

He really landed himself
the perfect family,

if your stepmother's to be believed.

But what about you, Beck?

Where do you fit into all this?

Your father has come such a long way.

Worked hard for it, too.

You're barking up
the wrong tree, lady,

if you think I'm gonna sit here
and validate that man.

Yeah, he's lucky to have you.

It just goes to show you

what a good Christian household
and a loving family can do.

She did not just suggest
if you were more Christian,

he wouldn't have abandoned you
for a crack pipe.

Mommy, come watch me.

Excuse me, my dear.

Your dad talk to you yet?

She's so her mother.
Only less subtle.

Talk to me about?

Well, he's supposed to tell you
he can't send money anymore.

But he's gonna help you
find a better job first.

Mom doesn't think he should wait.

She's so cranky.

It's the hormones.

Oh.

I wasn't supposed to tell you, but...

she's pregnant.

That's why they're fighting about it.

Great. It's great.

He's starting a new family...

because fixing the one he had
obviously wasn't an option.

Why would he ever do that?

I'm going to find a bathroom.
I'll be right back.

Can I get another "Timber Doodle"?

Bitch.

Hi. Is Joe Goldberg working today?

Joe Goldberg is not working today,
but I'm Ethan. And you would be...

Looking for Joe. Expect him anytime soon?

I do not, relatively speaking.
Joe's out of town.

But is there anything I can help you find?

Possibly.

I'm in the market for a first edition copy
of Ozma of Oz.

That's a pretty rare critter.

Uh, not sure we have it.

See, books of that pedigree,
we keep under a lock and key downstairs.

And you don't have the key?

Well, normally I have the key,
but I just don't have it right now.

Joe left with it.
He just forgot to give it to me.

And where is Joe?

I thought I was supposed to be writing.

Are you with "Eight Seconds"?

No. I told you, I'm on a retreat.

Is he with you?

What is it, Ethan?

Hey, bro. I know
you didn't want to be interrupted,

but this chick was just in
asking about a first ed. Ozma of Oz.

What are you talking about?

Joe's there. In Nyack.

What did she look like?

Uh, twenty-five-ish, brunette, kinda hot,

but, you know,
maybe that's like a type thing?

Peach Salinger.

Are you lying to me?

'Course you are.
That's what you do.

Lie so your life looks better.

Peach, I'm not lying.
I told you, I'm here to write. I...

I can't deal with this right now.
I promise I'll call you.

And you told her I'm here?

I'm sorry, man,
did I screw up or...

You'll know I'm here.
You may already know.

Hey, you.

Oh, sorry. So sorry.

How is this explainable?

Or do I run? Shit, shit, shit.

Joe?

Beck? What are you doing here?

That's true.
You are a bookseller, aren't you?

Sadly, I humiliate myself
like this annually.

Well, this is kinda workin' for you.

You mock.

It's fair.

I'm lying. I'm lying to you right now.

Excuse me?

I knew you were here.

I wasn't happy with how we left things,
and, apparently, neither were you,

seeing as how you were hiding out
in the bathroom.

I wasn't hiding, I swear.

We can at least agree that
I may have left you a little wanting?

Yeah.

So, you're saying you did want it
to last longer than eight seconds?

No! I mean, yeah, as in--

Wait, I thought it was a race.

Didn't I win?

No?

I just... I thought it'd be nice
if I came and surprised you.

And not leave you with
that memory of me for too long.

How did you, um...
How did you know I was here?

Oh, well, you posted
a nature shot this morning.

See that little restaurant sign
in the background?

Apparently,
Pops and Millie's ain't a chain.

-Hmm. Shocking. Really should be.
-Yeah.

So I googled it and I saw
all the information about the festival

and I figured this was probably why
you were in the area,

and by the way, this outfit
is really workin' on you, too.

Oh.

Um...

Can you hold on for just one second?

Hey, sweetie.
Cooper's kinda hitting a wall.

We were gonna head back
and rest up before dinner.

Okay, I'll find my own ride
back to the hotel.

And who is this handsome gentleman?

Sorry, this is Joe.

He works at a bookstore
I go to in the city.

Hey, Joe.

This is my wife, Nancy.
I'm Ned, Beck's dad.

-Hi.
-Very nice to meet you both.

You're welcome to join us
for dinner, Joe.

Yes! Totally. If you can.

I'd love to.

We'll see you then.

Okay, uh, I can explain. Um...

One day when I was 12, I got home
from school before my brother and sister,

and my mom was at work.

So I go into the basement
to play Mario Brothers,

and I...

I find my father unconscious

with a needle in his arm.

I thought he was dead.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

I mean, he survived it.

And, which, of course,
was this amazing thing.

So, when he disappeared on us
because he relapsed, I just...

I couldn't believe it.

Right then and there,
I decided he was dead.

Which is why I told you he was,
which is totally wrong.

I mean, who does that?

Well--

The first deep, personal thing
I tell you is a total lie.

Well, hang on. That's--

I know, I get it if you are horrified

and think I'm a total fraud and liar
and want nothing to do with me.

After everything you've been through?

I get it. I'm sorry.

You're sorry?

I am.

Anyway, I was at Brown

and he tracked me down
to say he'd gotten clean.

And then he says he wants to help
with my school and some of my bills,

like dad amends.

So I bury my resentment
and start having lunches with him

and doing stupid shit like this,

playing the dutiful daughter,

enduring this nauseatingly perfect
new family of his.

I'm sure they're not perfect.

Believe me. They are.

Well, I guess I'll find out tonight.

No, I am not
subjecting you to that.

I'll just... I'll tell them
you had to go back. Book emergency.

I'd be on board,
but that would be so un-Victorian of me.

The virtuous maiden
is supposed to be rescued

by the dashing, sometimes broody,
altogether charming hero.

And who is that?
Is that meant to be you?

That boat, she can take it.
You know it.

No, no. I know. I know it well.

I don't know if Beck's told you,

but I captained the Nantucket ferry
for 16 years.

I did not know that. I feel like I've been
telling Mickey Mantle how to hold a bat.

Do you sail, too?

God, no. Never had the patience for it.

Oh, Dad,
you know your way around a sailboat.

Enough to know I'm all thumbs.
I've been out a couple times.

You don't remember the renters next door?

They had that Sunfish
they let you take out? The Murphys?

Their cars
were always blocking the driveway.

How's life in the big city, dear?

It's great, thanks for asking.

Oh, and we broke our centerboard
that one time,

and the current took us, like,
halfway to Long Island?

What'd I say? Not much of a sailor.

But you do. You remember it, right?

It was pouring.

I learned every swear word
in the book that day.

-I don't think he remembers, dear.
-I think he can speak for himself, Nancy.

You know, you don't have to protect him.
He's not a child.

You're one to talk.

Excuse me?

You invest nothing in this family.
Nothing.

Not even a call to your father
on his birthday.

You know what? Stop.
You've no idea what you're talking about.

Because your father,
he's just an ATM to you, right, Beck?

Please, let's not do this.

I'm sorry, and what is he to you?

A feature for your blog,

so you can brag how you lifted him
out of the pits of despair?

Newsflash! He was sober when you met him.

I was in the pits with him.
And not because I wasn't Christian enough.

You didn't save him.

You think he'll fall over
if you pulled your hand out of his ass?

Guinevere, enough.

- What the hell are you looking at?
- Guinevere.

-Do not talk to my daughter that way.
-Okay, whatever. I'm done.

Oh, and congrats on the baby.
How blessed you all are.

Do you want him dead?

What?

Kinda feels like you and he...

have some unresolved stuff.

Believe me, I'm the king
of unresolved family issues.

I know what people splitting feels like.

I just wonder if, uh...

Look, he's here. He's alive.

Use that as an opportunity to talk to him.

Or, you're a writer.

Could be helpful to write about him.
Cathartic, too.

What are you doing?

-Nothing. I don't know.
-Do you hear yourself right now?

I mean, who the hell are you to tell me
that I have daddy issues?

-You don't even know me.
-No, Beck, hang on.

Just go. Leave me alone. I'm serious.

Hey, hon.

We're gonna get going.

Cool. Um...

Thanks for dinner.

This should cover the room.

It's hard for me to see you with them.

I keep waiting for you to be you again.

- This is me, Guinevere.
- No, it's not. You were...

Reckless and out of control.
And, honey, you were a kid. You...

-You didn't see what was going on.
-Yes.

Yes, I did.

And you were more than just an addict.

I miss you.

Whatever.

You know, I tell people that you're dead.

Kind of feels like you did die
that day in the basement.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

You were a good sailor.

Well, maybe you can tell me
about it sometime.

Maybe in Vermont...

over Christmas.

Like I said, I'll have to let you know.

"On the plywood over the bay window
We spray paint taunts at Hurricane Isabel

Cow her into a tropical storm

Her moon tide, though
Carries your beach chair away

Sea glass and Springsteen

The beached whale
The silent walk home

The grill that doesn't start
On the Fourth of July

The woman at the drug store you hit on
Who isn't Mom

The renters blocking the drive
The string of my sweatshirt I gnaw on

Morning sun over Wauwinet

The red ladle over the pan

Your wrist, the perfect cant

You leave for the 8:20 to Hyannis
With one commandment

Get the batter off the ladle
While it's wet

The ladle's left in the sink

Mom lets it soak
"Leave it," she says

You go away and we come home

And what's left of you, it loosens
And the water carries it away"

They say girls with daddy issues
are really good in bed.

I like who I am with you, Joe.

âª You can see it in my eyes âª

âª I'm gonna lay low
Comin' out of nowhere âª

âª I would lay low
Take a breath and say a prayer âª

Sorry I didn't call.
Is it okay if I come in?

âª Comin' out of nowhere âª

âª I would lay low
Take a breath and say a prayer âª

âª You play your game
I take my time âª

âª You take your aim
Commence your crime âª

âª I won't back down âª

âª Go all the way âª

- Too rough for you, Goldberg?
- Not at all.

âª I'm gonna lay low
Comin' out of nowhere âª

âª I would lay low
Take a breath and say a prayer âª

âª Comin' out of nowhere âª

I want you, Joe.

âª Comin' out of nowhere âª

âª Comin' out of nowhere
Comin' out of nowhere âª

âª Comin' out of nowhere
Comin' out of nowhere âª

Hey, stranger.

You drool in your sleep. So cute.

Were you watching me?

Maybe.

Uh-oh. Stalker.

Learned from the best.

How did you figure out where I live?

The bearded guy from the bookstore.

You taste like maple syrup.

Wait.

I have to apologize about our talk.

I was a hostile goose.

-A hostile goose?
-Yeah, geese are total dicks.

But, uh, no, seriously,
you called me on my shit,

and I took it really poorly because...

Well, because you were totally right,

and I didn't want to hear it,
and I'm sorry.

Like you said, we barely know each other
and here I was, trying--

You really don't think we know each other?

I mean, I was just...
I was angry when I said that, and--

Look...

sometimes I could swear
I've known you forever,

but in the grand scheme of things,

not long enough for me to be commenting
on your relationship with your father.

You were just trying to help me see
that I'm full of shit.

And you were sweet.

It's funny,
I feel like every guy I date is...

They're either messes like my dad was,
or they're like my dad is now,

trying to be something
they think they should.

Or they're me. Both a mess and a fraud.

-You're not a fraud.
-So just a mess?

No. Not more than anyone.

But then there is you.

I mean, you're not trying to be
anything than what you are.

You're just you.
There's not an ounce of falseness in you.

I mean, you drink CafÃ© Bustelo
and you own starch

and you don't care about dumb shit
like posting your life online.

I mean, it's a revelation.

Do you know how many selfies
I've taken on the toilet?

A lot.

Okay, instead of sitting here
watching you judge me,

I'm gonna go pee...

I'm not...

...and try not to take a selfie.

What are the chances
I'm getting a follow-up review?

Apparently, I've redeemed myself.

Far be it from me to stop you
from shouting it from the rooftops.

Plus, I guess it is nice
to hear it from your friends.

Even if not all of them
can share in your happiness.

It's really too bad.

The one whose approval you crave most
isn't my biggest fan.

Fortunately,
Paco's a remarkably quick reader.

I can return the book I, of course,
never had any intention of keeping.

And if that's not enough...

If Peach still has a problem...

Well, every relationship
has its obstacles to overcome, right?

I won't let her
get in the way of us, Beck.

I won't.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Your old phone, which I have,
is still logged into the cloud.

And that means I'm still logged into you.

I'm a poet.

- Get off the stage.
- Wrap it up.

Did you move here to be something?
I did. But it's not working out.

Do you think I'm unremarkable?

Unremarkable people don't worry
about being unremarkable.

-So good to see you, hon.
-You, too, Dad.

The addict part was true, I see,
but he never died.

He's here. He's alive.
Could be helpful to write about him.

Benji was the worst kind of poison.

The peanut allergy was real.

I guess Benji's gonna die an honest man.

- It's not okay to yell.
- Grown-ups do it all the time.

Grown-ups are assholes.

I told this guy,
stay away from my girlfriend's kid.

He just seems a little neglected.

-That's it! I--
-All right! All right!

This is a lovely collection.

That's funny. There's a book missing.
Joe was looking at it.

I, of course, never had
any intention of keeping the book.

If Peach still has a problem,

I won't let her
get in the way of us, Beck. I won't.

Good morning.
This is my favorite time of day.

When it's just the two of us.

Were you watching me sleep?

Creeper.

I love our little routine.
Always the same, but never stale.

Sex. Showers. More sex.

Breakfast. Avocado salted, bacon crispy.
Every day.

Your father was never consistent,
and you're still healing from that.

With my help.

Mmm. Do you mind if I keep working?
I just have tons--

Eat. Work. I'll fold the laundry.

That's right, Beck,
I even do your damn laundry.

I protect your time.
I let you focus on your work.

And guess what?
Now that I've made our mornings sacred,

you're actually writing.

Free of distraction.

Mostly.

Ron and Claudia again?

If the goddamn dishes ever got done,

I wouldn't be bumping
into a goddamn stack of plates.

Can't you say something?

I don't like to mess
with other people's lives.

Maybe you should.
Anyway, I gotta get to class.

The worst thing about our mornings?

They always end.

I pass the time by counting down
to the next moment I see you.

You're teaching me to be more patient.

And God knows I need the help
when it comes to your friends.

For some reason,
we share our nights with your friends

and appointment-viewing like The Bachelor.

How can self-respecting women
tolerate this crap?

Sometimes I swear
I'm the only real feminist you know.

It's either a full Brazilian,
or, like, full bush.

And it's like, "Listen, my snooch
is the third bowl of porridge."

I mean, meet me halfway, lady.
It's, like, insane.

That's hilarious.

These girls
are even more tedious in person.

Lynn is a dark cavern
where conversations go to die.

That's hilarious.

What personality she has is only
activated by low-calorie girly cocktails,

which is doubtless why she drinks so much.

Annika's decided I'm so amazing,
which true,

but joining Team Joe
is just the latest move

in her cold war with Queen Bitch herself.

Peach goddamn Salinger.

Hope you didn't
start the fun without me.

We did.

Annika, thank God
for that chest of yours.

Otherwise, you'd be spilling guac all over
that Himalayan blanket I got Beck.

So goes the endless merry-go-round
of food issues.

Peach snipes at Annika's body,
Annika rubs her assets in Peach's face,

which, as defense mechanisms go,
beats the hell out of crying.

I can get you some paper towels.

Wait up. I need a refill.

No, no. I got it. I'll take care of you.

No. It's all right.
I could use the company.

This is so much more fun
than girls' night classic.

You know, when it was just us girls?

Peach has it out for me.

Probably shouldn't have stolen
her copy of Oz.

Or maybe I shouldn't have returned it.

But all that's behind me, Beck.

If I just keep being
the perfect boyfriend,

you'll realize that life is
so much healthier away from this toxicity.

Joseph, I was thinking
about thinning out my library,

and I thought I'd ask the expert.
What's a book like this worth?

She's still trying to build a case

that I'd be willing to
swipe the damn thing.

It's printed by Reilly &amp; Britton.
An original. A rarity.

Hmm.

Guess I better act quick.

Before some desperate person
tries to steal my little beauty away.

The real tragedy would be
not appreciating what you have.

If I were you, I'd hold onto her forever.

But what do I know?
I'm just a bookstore clerk.

I'm trying, Beck. I am.

But your friends
bring out the worst in me.

And then Rastiche taught me this.

- D minor. Goosebumps, man.
- Is that a D minor?

Hi, Joe!

This place is...

musty.

Hi! Hi!

Annika, what brings you to Mooney's?

Your website,
and the deep sadness it evokes.

I mean,
did you do this in Myspace?

I've been telling Joe
we need to modernize.

Joe, I have 3.6 million followers.

And I get 12k for a selfie in glasses,

but I'm willing to do Mooney's for free
out of the kindness of my big-ass heart.

- All right. Let's do it.
- Yay!

If you need some authentic
Russian folk vibes, I can...

Thank you. But I got this.

"Smart bitches get their brains juiced
at Mooney's. Hashtag, stacked."

If you ever wonder what it takes
to become an influencer,

specifically, a body-positive Insta-celeb,
be shameless.

Annika's turning her curves
into an empire.

Inspiring the ladies,
arousing the gentlemen.

Everyone wins.

It'd be genuinely empowering
if it weren't so clearly a rebellion

against being Peach's, quote,
"fat friend from prep school."

And what's this?
Thank you, Annika's private Facebook.

Hello, nose job.

And just like that, I know how to repay
Annika for her kindness.

Annika, why the hell
is this not on your Insta?

Oh, my God,
because it's mortifying?

I mean, I'm adorkable, but Peach...

Lucky she is not on Facebook.
It is cute, though.

Do you run everything you post
by Peach first?

Hell, no!

You're right. Screw it.
This is the ultimate throwback.

I just need a brilliant caption.

How about,
"Bitches being our most authentic selves"?

Joe,

it's like you're in my brain.

No, I just know her audience.

Team Joe, one. Peach, zero.

You'd be proud of me, Beck.
I'm a good friend.

Hi, Allison. You wanted to see me?

Guinevere. Please, sit.

I understand that some things
are harder than others to write about.

Our own families
are usually the top of the list.

-I'm glad you stuck with it.
-Thank you.

My lit agent's assistant just got promoted

and may be able to connect you
with some jobs for hire.

Personal essays, reviews--

I'm in. I am so in! Thank you, Allison.

-I'll forward her contact info to you.
-Okay!

And Beck?

I was sorry to read about
your father's passing.

Peach tried hard
to get you for a girls' night.

But you picked me.
Joe, two. Peach, bupkis.

Whoa!

I think you might be
a little overdressed for sushi.

No. You're under-dressed
for the celebration I have planned.

The theme of our evening
is Fitzgerald and Zelda.

-Ooh. Which one of us is Zelda?
-Me, obviously.

We begin at The Palm Court,

where our literary couple famously danced
in the Plaza fountain.

Where a burger costs 30 bucks.

You're gonna wanna be
in something a little jazzier.

We will be sitting in the very booth
where F. Scott conceived of Gatsby.

That seems fake.

And then, after we've snarked
about our $50 goat cheesecake,

a horse-drawn carriage will take us

-to an even more exclusive club...
-No way.

...where Zelda herself...

danced the night away.

Oh, that's weird. Annika never calls.

Hey, Annika.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

What video?

I've got a bad feeling, Beck.

"Click on my profile." Hmm.

I have black guys that say, like,

they see me and they're all like,
"Damn, girl." You know?

Where are the white guys
that want a girl with a big butt?

Posted anonymously. Yikes.

This looks old,
but casual racism is evergreen.

And the Internet is turning against Annika
at the speed of outrage.

Of course, I can come over.

But the timing, Beck.
A video from college? Today?

In response to
Annika taking a stand against Peach?

Connect the damn dots.

-I have to go. Annika's having, like--
-Okay, go. Be with your friend.

Help her push Peach out a window.

-I'll text you tomorrow.
-Okay.

I made a mistake.
I underestimated Peach. Her cruelty.

Today, it's Annika.
Tomorrow, it could be you. Us.

Beck, I may never be able to prove

your best friend is capable of
destroying you with a flick of her wrist,

but that won't stop me from trying.

I'm sorry I'll miss you this morning.
But this is what it's come to.

I'm running. I'm a runner now.

Until yesterday,
I put all my effort into avoiding Peach.

But you know what they say.

Keep your friends close,
and your enemies...

Keep losing your enemies
because you're so goddamn out of shape.

Why does my kidney hurt?

This is torture,
but I have to know what we're up against.

I need to get into her head.

So, exhibit A. Peach starts every day
by punishing her own body.

Sadomasochist? Orthorexic?
Jury's still out.

Exhibit B. Peach is loathed at work.

Jayden, the Jacobsen chairs you ordered
are knock-offs.

And the specs on the Vanderbilt townhouse

were supposed to be
in my office by 7:00 a.m.

It's 6:50.

Entitled? Nepotized?
I'm getting warmer.

She doesn't go anywhere
without that laptop.

If only I could see inside.

Exhibit C in our tour of Peach's psyche.

Gauche? Demented?

If this is the fruit
of Peach's imagination,

there's no telling
what horrors she's capable of.

At least I have your old phone.

So, I sometimes get a warning
before Miss Congeniality appears.

Hey. Is Joseph here?

-Yeah, he's somewhere working.
-Oh.

Good morning, Joseph.

Anyways, what's the big news?

Okay, so, I didn't want to be tacky

and steal the spotlight
from Annika's meltdown last night,

but my professor
is hooking me up with an agent.

Beck, that's amazing
and surprising, but...

Shit! I'm so mad at myself.

What do you mean?

You know, with my family and everything,
I have agency connections.

So, I was gonna call a friend.
Roger Stevens.

Roger Stevens?
Doesn't he rep, like, famous writers?

You mean, like, Pulitzer winners,
Booker Prize finalists,

67% of the Times Best Sellers list?

Yeah, Beck, I'd say Roger Stevens
has repped some famous writers,

which, no offense, begs the question:

Why would he be interested
in an MFA student?

You can write for magazines, totally.

You know? That's legit, honest work.
Like what Annika does.

But Roger doesn't sell articles, you know?
He represents real authors.

So, it just depends on who you want to be.

I mean, if you can introduce us--

Happy to.
Yeah, he and I know each other

from when he was a counselor
at my Jew camp, so...

You know what?

Joseph? Joseph! Joseph?

I didn't know you were here, Peach. Hey.

We are gonna need you
to shut this place down tomorrow night

for a private party.

You know, it's perfect.

Roger is obsessed with
the sad and gritty New York.

I'll take care of everything,
if you can just...

you know, clean up a little.

Really, Peach?
God, you're amazing.

- Of course.
- Thank you.

You don't owe me anything, okay?

Happy to.

Oh, but you do, Beck.

But what am I supposed to do,
root for your failure?

That's not love. That's not me.

Wuthering Heights, huh?

It's a near-perfect cover...

for "Juvenilia: The Prosecution of Minors
in New York State."

I hear what goes on when Ron gets drunk.

I get it. You want options.
Legally-defensible options.

Maybe you're figuring out
what would happen

if you took a swing at Ron.

Put yourself between him and your mom?

Well, screw the book.
I can tell you what'll happen.

Best case, you hurt him.

Worst case, he hurts you back.

Someone at school will see
what he did to you.

Next thing you know, CPS is at your door.
You have 30 minutes to pack a bag.

Your mom loses custody.

You get punted from group home
to group home to group home

until you're 18.

Or you get fed up
and see if you can hack it on the streets.

Maybe you can do that. I couldn't.

Read this instead.

The Count of Monte Cristo.
It's another Dumas.

And we'll talk when you're done.

What's it about?

Revenge.

But more importantly,
living with the enemy.

âª Just clap your hands now âª

âª Never did I ever
Mean to make a mess âª

So, he gives the Pulitzer back,
and he's like,

"I'll have to trust you.
I wrote the whole thing on acid."

Hi.

- I thought you said this would be casual.
- Oh.

- Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Wait.

I need to get a drink first.

Don't be nervous.

Just be yourself.

I can't be myself.

I mean, the only reason
an agent like Roger Stevens

would even be interested in me
are my stupid essays

about my stupid dead dad
who's very much alive.

Okay, so don't be yourself.
Be more interesting.

You know, half the authors
you've ever read made up personas.

You know,

the Fitzgerald-in-a-fountain story
is tourism-fueled bullshit.

So give this guy a version of Beck

birthed by the same
formidable, creative mind

that put those words to paper.

Fitzgerald.

And Zelda.

Roger, this is Guinevere Beck,
the writer I was telling you about.

- Guinevere, milady, I love it!
- It's so old-fashioned!

Just call me Beck.
A lady I am not.

Well, I'm gonna go check on
the pear water. Be back.

So, how long have you known Peach?

Since her Adderall days. You?

You know,
since I started selling her Adderall.

Hard not to stare, right?

Roger keeps it tight.

I guess the book business
isn't always so pale and flaccid.

Did Beck tell you
I started jogging?

Fun. Runner's high is better than sex.

And for some, may last longer.

TouchÃ©, bitch.

Honestly, I'm starting to think
people who run just hate themselves.

No. It's all about the music, Joseph.

Find the right song,
and the whole thing becomes effortless.

Like Roger and Beck.

Can I be honest?

She's lucky she has me.

Beck rarely knows what's best for her.

I couldn't agree more.

Of course. Password-protected.
It's too risky.

Peach is already paranoid.

So, these are the humans
that made a creature like Peach.

God forbid a hair's out of place
for the country club crowd.

Bingo.

Diary.

Food diary. Christ, is there no end
to the neuroses?

Hello.

How old were you
when this was taken, Beck?

And what is Peach doing with it?

Hello, Joe.

Sorry I'm so wet.

Your friend is feisty.
Can she write?

There's potential.
She's not quite there yet, though.

MFA programs are such a scam.

You want me to give your friend
some advice?

She wants to be a real writer,
she should drop out.

I'm working on it.

Just, you know,
be gentle turning her down.

It sucks to be right, Beck.

Peach is trying to sabotage your career.

And I have to know why.

Here are some of
the most common passwords.

Password. 123456. Babygirl.

"Babygirl," really?

In any case, I doubt Peach is that stupid.

So, I'm outsourcing to someone
who's known her longer.

Hey, Annika. How are you holding up?

Well, I lost all my sponsors
'cause they're all a bunch of pussies,

a third of my Instagram followers,

and the only person who tweeted
in my defense was a Kardashian, so...

I mean, honestly,
where's the witch hunt for the guy

who saw a black-out-drunk girl
and decided to whip out his camera?

- Where's Beck?
- At my place.

She's revising one of her pieces.
She's been slammed.

Not too busy to party with Peach, though.

But, hey, that's Peach.
Beck's her favorite puppy.

-"Puppy"?
-She treats her like a pet, right?

Every day, it's like, "Beckalicious this,"
and "Beckalicious that."

And you know Beck secretly loves it.

The two of them are so co-dependent.

I'm sorry.
I know she's your girlfriend. I...

No. You know,
in Beck's defense, she really is writing.

I'm pushing her to make her deadlines.

Well, ain't you boyfriend of the year?

-I try.
-Yeah.

Hey, did Peach ever have any real pets?

Lame segue. I need the password.

-Um... Dalloway.
-Dalloway.

Yeah. A purebred bichon frise, obviously.

Yeah, Peach was, like,
devastated when she ran away.

I'm sorry,
I just need to work through this out loud.

It's like...

You know who gets away with

a self-deprecating joke
that's a little risquÃ©?

And by "risquÃ©," she means racist.

The fat girl.

Everybody laughs because she is harmless
and drunk and funny,

but, like, in a fat way.

But you know who gets crucified
for that same risquÃ© joke?

Again, to be clear, racist.

The former fat girl
who is actually just embracing her body.

I mean, girls won't let girls just...

be.

Thank God. This was a huge mistake.

Sorry, it's Beck.

Hey. What's up?

So, Peach is here.

As in, here in your apartment.

Something about a stolen laptop.

Why don't you save us the embarrassment
and tell me where it is?

Is it in the kitchen?
Is it under the sofa?

Some little hidey-hole

where you squirrel away
all your stolen goods?

-Stolen goods? Okay, slow down.
-Yeah.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Yes, you do.

Last night, you left halfway through.
Where did you go, Joseph?

Probably to take a piss?

Peach, believe it or not,
I can afford my own computer.

Beck. Help me out.

I don't know.

-What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.

I mean, of course you didn't...

I just...
Please don't put me in the middle of this.

Okay, Peach, if your laptop is stolen,
I believe you.

But the people at the party
weren't exactly strapped for cash, so...

I don't know, I mean,

is there, like, some other
more personal reason

someone would mess with you?

Oh, my God, Peach.

Weren't you just saying last week

that you were feeling unsafe
in your own home?

Whoa. I...

I mean, you run out in the open
every morning.

You're very pretty. You're a Salinger.

What if someone's creeping on you?

It wouldn't be the first time.

It wouldn't? Hallelujah.

Let's just say that James Franco and I
didn't end well.

We should call the police.

What are they gonna do?

Interrogate every single one
of Peach's friends?

Good luck convincing them
it's not just misplaced.

I'm sorry, I have to ask.
Have you tried Find My Computer yet?

It's just this little GPS--

I don't need you to mansplain
Find My Computer.

-I know how to do it.
-Okay.

Peach, isn't that your place?

She didn't think I'd be dumb enough
to bring her laptop here, did she?

Classy apology.

Joe, stop it.

Stop what? That was some bullshit, Beck.

And you didn't exactly rush to my defense.

What was I supposed to do?
You two are always sniping at each other.

And breaking into
each other's places,

but that's not the point.

She has had it out for me
from the first day we met.

No, she hasn't.

Are you blind?

Maybe you can't see it,
but Peach is next-level vindictive.

You know what?
If you hate my friends so much,

- why do you hang out with them?
- Because you force me to!

-If I didn't, I wouldn't see you.
-I don't have time for this.

I was supposed to send my pages
to Roger Stevens, like, an hour ago.

He doesn't care. He doesn't care.
He doesn't care.

He doesn't care!

He's never gonna sign you.

Peach is setting you up to fail.
I heard them talking at the party.

Roger thinks MFAs are a waste of time,
and Peach said herself

she thinks that you are not ready.

I'm sorry. I know the truth hurts,
but I have to set you free.

You are an asshole.

You know, if you don't believe in me,
just say so.

Don't come up with
some bullshit conspiracy theory.

No, Beck. Wait. No. I'm telling the truth.

You're allowed to be jealous of Roger.

I get it, you're a guy.
Boo-hoo, he's young and successful.

- No, that's not... No, wait. No, no.
- I don't care.

The last thing I would've expected
you to be was unsupportive.

Our first fight.

It was worse than I could've imagined.

And it's all thanks to Peach.

I want to punish her
for coming between us.

But I can't. I'm not that guy.

I'm an understanding,
supportive boyfriend.

I'm barely clever enough
to have gotten away with this.

The last piece of the Peach puzzle.
Proof that she has it out for you.

Here we go. "Dalloway."

God, even the dog is pretentious.

Thanks for nothing, Annika.

"Beckalicious this,"
and "Beckalicious that."

There's no way this works.
But also, please work.

Okay. Officially skeeved.

Not sure what I'm looking for,
but I'll know it when I...

Oh. "GB." Guinevere Beck?

What the hell?

Is this blackmail?

No, there's too much of it.
Going too far back.

I know what it's like
to be in love with you, Beck.

This is not what love looks like.
This isn't how love behaves.

This is the work of a sick mind.

Let's call it what it is. Perversion.

Now I understand
why Peach is setting you up for failure.

She's not threatened by you.
She's obsessed with you.

You know
I love you forever, right?

She wants to watch you,
have you, control you

like she controls
every other piece of her life.

She wants you all to herself.

Beck...

you've got a stalker.

Stop me if you've heard this one before.

A girl grows up
in a strict, old-money family

where any deviations from tradition
are punished.

Two choices:
be like them or be excommunicated.

No love, no money.

At some point, she makes a friend.
That's you, Beck.

She develops a harmless crush.

And it's 2018, so who gives a shit
if she's gay or bi or pan

or just a mortal in the presence of your
dangerous and exceptional pheromones?

I'll tell you who. Her family.
And she knows it.

So she takes her normal, healthy feelings
and crushes them.

Nurses them in a dark,
secret place for years.

Until they mutate into an obsession.
A sickness.

And now, your best friend is a stalker
and a sociopath and... Oh, God. A liar.

Runner's high is a myth.

Why the hell did I take up jogging again?

I'm in hell, Beck.

Even if I could share the proof,
you'd never believe me.

And now you're not even talking to me,
which means you're in trouble.

Look at you,
like a little literary hooker.

Get in!

Hey.

I so appreciate you reading my stuff.

Thank you for being down to ride.

I've got this Met benefit lunch
downtown this afternoon.

I figured you and I
could just bang it out.

Hey, office hours are better
without the office.

Well said.

Hey, speaking of.
These essays, these poems...

Loved, loved, loved every page.

Oh, my God. Really?

Fathers are the worst.

It's like their job is to mess us up.

What if we all just had two moms, right?
There'd be no wars. None.

I know, right?

Okay.

I'm gonna be real with you.

I think some of your stuff is problematic.

Wait. What do you mean?

Addiction is a disease.

And you wanna put your dead dad
on trial for being a victim?

I think the one you're talking about,

it's meant to be about forgiveness.

I'm sorry. That is my bad.

I skimmed.

So, what's your thing?

Is it, "Like daddy, like daughter"?

-Ow. Shit.
-What the hell? What are you doing?

Will you relax?

Here, take one of these.

No, I don't take anything.

Jesus, no wonder
I couldn't get through your stuff.

Peach was right. You have a lot to learn.

You think sobriety created
Joyce Carol Oates, sweetheart?

-You have a problem.
-You're a judgy little bitch.

Could you pull over?

This book is crap.

He waits 24 years to get justice?

What kind of message is that?

A smart one. It's all about the long game.

My mom needs help now.

Sometimes, putting yourself
between two people

is a surefire way to make things worse.

I promise you, we're not gonna let
anything happen to you or your mom.

It's too late.

Beckish? I got your SOS.

Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? Come here.

You set me up.

Excuse me?

Your friend, Roger Stevens,
was an asshole and a freak.

He doesn't want to sign me.
He never wanted to sign me.

This whole thing was just
designed to humiliate me.

Okay, calm down and tell me what happened.

He didn't even read my stuff.

He was a rude, entitled douche
who only wanted to get high and,

I wish I was exaggerating,
bang me in a limo.

- Okay.
- And you sent me there!

I had no idea that he was using again.

I mean, he's been clean since 9/11.

Beck, when it happened,
he was in an airport.

I don't give a shit!

You threw me under the bus!

"She's got a lot to learn"?

Go to hell.

Joe was right.
You live to cut down your friends.

Okay. I don't know
what your boyfriend told you--

Don't lie to me, Peach. I'm not stupid.
I'm not Annika.

Oh, come on. Annika may not remember
the night she went on that rant, but I do.

Junior year, Marcy House?
I was there. We were both there.

Are you accusing me of sabotaging Annika?

And me, and anyone else
who edges into your spotlight.

You would rather pick apart your friends
than maybe admit

that you're not being
your most amazing self right now.

It is exhausting being your friend!

I don't know what to say.

I mean, it was a favor, Beck.

And I don't need to love
your self-absorbed poetry

in order to be kind to you.

Where are you going?

Beck.

Beck? Come back.

âª No one knows what it's like âª

âª You and me âª

âª You and I âª

Can I come in?

I owe you an apology.

You were right.

About Peach's douchebag agent.
About Peach.

I told you so.
I told you so.

I'm so sorry.

How do you see things so clearly?

I mean, things I can't even
see for myself?

You must hate me.

Are you kidding?

I loathe you.

Get out of here, you trash goblin!

Whatever. This place is a dump.

Is it honesty o'clock?

Because I've been saving up
some intense constructive criticism.

No, I can't handle it!
Back to secrets and lies, please.

-Ignore that.
-You think?

I'm sorry. This is gonna keep happening.

She needs to get the message now.

You need to stop calling me.

Peach?

I just wanted to say
you were right.

I'm a bitch. I'm sorry.

Peach, what's going on?

Nothing. I just took some pills.

Which pills?

All of them.

Peach?

Peach? Peach?

Peach?

Oh, no.

Joe, I need towels,

and there's a naloxone spray
in the guest bathroom.

- Which one is that?
- It's downstairs!

That's good. Get it all out.

Thanks.

Where's the nasal spray?

- Shit, it must've come out in the hallway.
- It's fine. I'll get it.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

No way.

Peach logged her own suicide?

200 milligrams ibuprofen,
15 milligrams Wellbutrin.

There isn't enough in her system
for a light buzz, let alone an OD.

I see you spying, Joseph.

And you can't prove I wrote it all down.

Jesus, Beck.

This whole thing is an act.

A trap.

Tell me you see it.

I'll call the hospital.

No.

They'll put a 72-hour hold on me.
I'll be committed.

Exactly.

Beck, if this is real,
she needs to go to a hospital.

"If this is real"?

Did you even try to find the naloxone?

Joseph.

Joe, you wait outside.

Yeah.

Thank you for saving me.

Joe does have a point.

You should get a checkup.

What if instead you just stayed the night?

Just in case anything happens.

Whatever you need.

Beck, what I said
about her faking it--

Ugh, please, Joe. Stop.

She could've died.

We're not that lucky.

You two had one fight.

She tries to off herself, like that?
It doesn't add up.

This isn't the first time
Peach has tried to kill herself.

You're kidding.

I've talked her off of a ledge
more times than I can count.

So when she needs me, she really needs me.

I understand.

I understand that I'm too late.

There's too much history.

I understand
without a shadow of a doubt...

Peach wins.

How is a normal guy supposed to compete
with a rich, unstable stalker

who'd rather fake her own suicide
than be apart from you?

Your whole life is braided with Peach's.

Inseparable, now and forever,

until she drags you
into her own personal Grey Gardens.

Right now, she's probably
sinking her claws deeper.

You think wrecking this place
is gonna solve our problems?

Are you high again?

Another person I failed to help.

I thought I could better myself for you.
I couldn't.

I tried to be the perfect boyfriend,
the perfect friend to your friends,

and it wasn't enough. So, to hell with it.

It's freeing in a way,
to know so definitively where I stand.

Where you stand.

To know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

And just like that,
everything clicks into place.

My feet. Runner's high.

It is pretty great.

And I remember
this is why I took up jogging.

âª You must run and hide âª

âª For the hunter, he seeks âª

âª With his devilish pride âª

Oh. She's dead.

Of course she's dead. She fell.

That's right, she fell.

An accident. Happens all the time.

She was running and she fell. Into a rock.

Over and over again.
Okay, let's be real, she was attacked.

Someone attacked her.
But maybe they had a good reason, right?

You ever think of that, Detective?

Shit! Detectives are real

and DNA is a thing
and I just hit that girl with a rock.

God, the sound.
I would never hurt a woman.

But she was a dangerous,
flesh-hungry harpy.

She forced my hand.
That's on her and her family

for screwing her up.
I had to, Beck. I had to.

I knew you'd never forgive me,
but she gave me no choice.

I'm not a bad person.
She was going to ruin you.

But you're safe now. Thanks to me.

I just want you to live your best life.

It's brave, what I do for you.

It's not easy. It's hard.
Sometimes it makes me sick.

I'm brave.

How many guys will do anything
for the person they love?

Honestly, Beck. You're lucky to have me.

It's over. What's done is done,

and now there's nothing
standing between me and...

Paco.

Paco, what did you do?

I couldn't take another night.

I didn't know how many sleeping pills
would knock him out.

Beck, you asked me to help Paco,
but turns out you're gonna save him.

Because it's thanks to you
that I know exactly what to do.

We need towels.
Does your mom have any naloxone?

It would be in the bathroom cabinet.
A nasal spray. Fast.

-Do I call 911?
-Not if you want to see your mother again.

You freak. You little freak.

The universe has a funny way
of keeping us humble.

That beating was karmic. I know it.

I did a bad thing today.

But for a good reason.

And if there's any justice in the world...

you are the reward for all my suffering.

Hey, you.

Oh, Joe, thank God.

Peach was attacked in Central Park
in broad daylight.

I'm headed to the ER now.

She's alive?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Joe Goldberg?

I heard about you and Candace.

She thought she could be happier
with some guy in Rome.

Peach doesn't go anywhere
without that laptop.

If only I could see inside.

Guinevere Beck?

This is the work of a sick mind.

She's obsessed with you.

She wants you all to herself.

It is exhausting being your friend!

I don't need to love
your self-absorbed poetry

in order to be kind to you.

Beck rarely knows what's best for her.

I couldn't agree more.

It's freeing in a way, to know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

Paco, what did you do?

I didn't know how many sleeping pills
would knock him out.

Hey, you.

Peach was attacked in Central Park
in broad daylight.

I'm headed to the ER now.

She's alive?

It's been three whole days
since I've seen you.

I failed you, Beck.

And this is my punishment.
Is this my walk to the gallows?

Should I be preparing last words?

Some humans, Beck, are cancer.

Peach is stage four metastatic.

I tried to cut out the mass
before it consumed you. But now?

Best case, I gotta go in there
and win an Oscar kissing the ring.

Worst case...

she knows it was me.

And it's over.

Is this an ambush?
Will you love me in prison?

Hi.

Oh, no.

I can't believe I told you to get involved
with your neighbor's shit.

It's okay. It's not your fault.

God, I've missed you.

How's Peach?

Oh, as well as can be expected.

Um, do you mind taking off your shoes?

And anything that has touched
other people or the subway?

Sure.

Look who is here.

How are you feeling, Peach?

I'm on to you.

Hmm?

Is this it? The noose, tightening?

You play the gormless ne'er-do-well,
and yet...

-And yet?
-It was you.

You're the one that warned me.
I have a stalker.

Ha!

-Oh.
-We're trying to figure out who it is.

You know, they say most people
are stalked by someone they know.

I mean, isn't that terrifying?

It's like I'm finally understanding
the dark side of celebrity.

This beauty blogger I know
is on her third stalker.

Becks, I'd love some more tea.

Oh, my shackled Cinderella,
if Peach gets her way,

you'll be making organic concussion tonic
until your beauty fades.

Oh, do you want some?
It'd be good for your head.

No, I'm okay. Thank you.

You have pages due.

You have a boyfriend with a black eye.
None of this is okay.

Actually, I'm gonna...

Hey, how long is she gonna stay here?

I don't know. Maybe indefinitely?

She's afraid to stay at her house,
which I understand.

They let her out of the hospital
pretty quick.

Like, three days.
I mean, it was a concussion.

I don't think
she should be your responsibility.

Hey...

when this is all over,
let's go away somewhere.

Just you and me.

Sorry to interrupt.

No, it's fine. What's up?

Just, you know, given everything
that I've been through, um,

male energy in my healing space just
isn't optimal.

So, would you mind
asking Joseph to leave us?

I think he heard you, Peach.

I don't need confrontation right now.
And have him take his gift with him.

I gotta run some errands.

I'm sorry.

Uh, Beck, my tea?

Peach, come lay down.
You look dizzy.

Peach, you really need to relax.

Paris. Two tickets. First class.
I underestimated her.

She's not thinking about me at all.
She's busy making you all hers, forever.

And I put you right in her pocket,

where you can't write, you can't love.

You can't be you,
if you're living for Peach.

I won't let it happen.
I need a new plan.

I'm glad you were all here for me.

Because, now,

it's war.

Hey, Joe!

I'm so sorry, Joe.

It's okay. It's okay, man.
We're good. We're good, I promise.

Go inside, mijo.

Just a little something to say thank you.

-A specialty. Fudge brownies.
-Oh, thank you.

It was kind of you to get involved.

I know things have been
a little bumpy here, the past few weeks.

Try months.

I just want you to know
that we're working on it.

So, if you're thinking
of pressing charges or anything...

And expose Paco's
little chemistry experiment? No.

Claudia--

This whole experience
really did something to Ron.

And I know how it sounds,
but I feel like it changed him.

Like he wants to do better.

People don't change.

And I'm not gonna press charges.

Thank you, Joe.

I owe you one.

-Hey.
-I only got a minute.

Peach is getting an IV vitamin treatment
across town, but I wanted to see you.

Is everything okay?

Listen, I'm going away for a few days.

Peach's family has a place in Greenwich
and she said she'd feel safer there.

I bet she would.

And what about school?

-What about us?
-Joe, she almost died.

But not quite.

I know you've been through a lot,
but risking your future

for the same person
who tried to sabotage your career,

like, a week ago...
I mean, it's a little crazy.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

But I'm always gonna be honest with you,
and honestly...

she's manipulating you.

Why in the world would she want--

Because... You really can't see this?

If you become your own person,
she won't be able to control you.

I know that you don't want to hear it,
but the suicide attempt was a show.

She was never in any real danger.

Oh, so, she just attacked herself
in the park?

No. No. I'm not saying that.

Good. Because the whole victim blaming
is starting to sound a little 4chan.

Yeah. Uh...

She's in love with you.
You know that, right?

-I gotta go.
-Beck, no. I'm sorry. Wait--

No, it's fine. Thank you for being honest.

Okay. Think.
Peach is taking you out of town.

But that's just a prelude.

She eases you into her world
and then snatches you away forever.

I'd follow you, of course,
but, Beck, I hate French food,

and you love New York,
and I need to save you.

Ah, my face is killing me.
Thanks a billion, Ron.

Okay, Greenwich.
That's where this stops.

Connecticut's Gold Coast.

Land of hedge fund managers
and Mayflower descendants.

Shouldn't be hard to find you.

World gets a lot smaller when
you only have to search one percent of it.

And just like that,
the Internet gods provide.

Only an hour drive.
I love a mini road trip.

I used to take 'em all the time
with Candace.

It'd be nice to make new,
happier memories, actually.

If I'm headed into one-percent land,
I'll need to look the part.

So, thank you, Benji.

This is not how I lose you.
No hesitation this time.

This time, I finish it.

I'm coming, Beck. I'm--

âª I know you belong âª

âª To somebody new âª

âª But tonight âª

âª You belong to me âª

âª Although we're apart âª

âª You are a part of my heart âª

âª And tonight âª

âª You belong to me âª

Candace?

Oh...

Bunny, are you okay?

-Morning.
-Morning.

Car trouble?

No. No.

-No, but I--
-License and registration?

-I was robbed.
-Robbed? By who?

Have you had anything to drink
this morning, Mr...

I need to think, or it's game over.

I'm sorry, Spencer Hewitt.

Can you step out of the car, please?

Absolutely.

Put your hands on the Buick, sir.
Take off your glasses, please.

You gonna tell me
what happened to your face?

Morning, Beckalissima.

What are you doing?

Just eating breakfast.
I was starving.

You don't eat any of this.

Just felt like carpe-ing the diem.
You know.

When I was a kid, I used to come up here,

and my aunt would
make this massive spread,

and, I don't know,
I guess I got inspired by the memory.

It's easy to forget sometimes.
You wanna go to the mall?

Um, you haven't shopped retail since
the Steve Madden incident freshman year.

I feel like slumming it.
And then we can get lunch.

I am craving pizza like a madwoman.

We can top it off with a matinee.
What do you say?

I don't know. It sounds like a lot.
I'm kinda tired.

And that's my fault.

I've been a lot to handle lately,
and I want to make it up to you.

So, why don't you eat your breakfast
and get dressed?

And then, let me spoil my best friend.

Now, eat up.

Just kids. They really
kicked the shit out of me, though.

Took my wallet and my wedding ring.

-Not your watch, though.
-No. No, I got lucky, I guess.

Lucky he wouldn't know
an 80,000 Genevan timepiece

if it slapped him in the dick.
Thanks, Benji.

Apparently, it doesn't take brains
to be a criminal.

Just balls.

If Opie's gonna bone me,
I wish he'd lube up and get on with it.

I'm gonna have to go run your plate,
then I'll let you get home to your wife.

Must be nice being married to a doctor.

Sure is.

You get out on the water much, Officer?

Yeah, you got the look. I can tell.
Listen, be our guest next summer.

The old man's bringing the yacht up
from Nantucket.

What model?

Azimut 62S. The Guinevere.

Quick little minx.

You see that? Contempt.

Opie just decided I'm a rich tool

and of no consequence to
the health and safety of his jurisdiction.

He won't run my plates.

You know...

maybe you should just get home.
Get some rest.

No rest for the wicked,
but I appreciate the concept.

-Thank you so much.
-Drive safe.

I'm just here to be close by
if you need me.

I don't trust Peach, Beck.
And neither should you.

This place is a castle.

Complete with wicked witch
and damsel in distress.

Guess that makes me your knight.
For you, Beck, yes.

Ah, I wasn't planning to break in,

but if you're gonna leave
the back door wide open...

Okay. Nobody home.

My head.

All in all, I thought it'd be worse.

I got a concussion once,
playing soccer, when I was 12.

Puked my brains out.

Not fun, but nowhere near enough
to keep me from my mission.

If anything, it means I need to patch up,

focus, get back in the game.

Oh, wow.

I'm so glad
we got away together like this, Bunny.

This place is adorable.

I'm not leaving this bed
for the next 48 hours.

You in?

Oh, I'm in.

I love you, you know?

The spirit of the '90s is alive
in Greenwich.

I can't wait to see that dress on you.
You have to try it on.

So cold.
I think I'm gonna take a bath.

Oh. Use the one in the master.
It has well-placed jets.

- I like the claw-foot tub.
- Of course you do.

Because you're classy.
Cocktail? I'll get you one.

I want to give you
a life this grand someday.

God knows, you deserve it.

Darling, I made you a Negroni.

Minus the unwanted pressure

from an obviously unstable,
obsessed person, of course.

My hatred for Peach
has practically become sentient.

Now, take your time and relax, okay?

I've got a surprise for you
when you get out.

Oh, and don't forget to use
that geothermal mud mask.

- It is life-changing. Cheers.
- Thanks.

Look at that!

How dare she
invade your privacy like that?

It's perverse! God, I have to pee.

I'll double back for that.

Now, how long is she going to
stand there staring at you?

Hello?

Anyone here?

- Who is that?
- Um...

It's the surprise.

She has a gun, Beck.

She's not in her right mind
and you know it.

I have to do something.

80% of gun accidents happen in the home.

Why is Peach dressing you up like a doll?

Okay, I'm wearing this ridiculous thing.
What's my surprise?

Oh, my God! Raj!

Hey, gorgeous. Long time no see.

I can't wait to catch up, doll.

I thought we said no phones.

Sorry. It's just my brother.

All right. Let's duet.

You know any Sabbath?

Uh...

It's funny
what sticks in your brain.

Sounds. A bit of song.

Give us one second, Raj.

And now, I fear, this chucklehead's
voice calling you gorgeous.

I knew Peach was an instigator.

And this is when her trap
starts closing in.

- What the hell is he doing here?
- I thought it'd be fun.

What happened to you not wanting
to be around male energy?

- I feel much better now.
- Well, that makes one of us.

- You're still mad at me. I get that.
- Do you?

I said your poetry was self-absorbed.
And I'm sorry my words hurt, but--

- But?
- Hear me out.

You are one of the most
talented people I know,

and I hate to see you
conforming to a system

that is designed to crush individuality.

If you want to be a great writer,

you have to get out there
and live a life worth writing about.

What do you want me to do, Peach?
Live off the land?

Cousin Inez finally vacated
the Paris flat.

I talked to my dad.

He said I could have it
and oversee the renovation.

She had a pet ocelot. There was damage.

Wait, you're moving to Paris?

We are moving to Paris, chÃ©rie.

Peach, this is crazy. I--

I don't need an answer right now.
Relax.

I just want you to trip on it.

Hence, Raj.

Look, Paris could be a new beginning
for the both of us.

Say you'll think about it.

Don't do it.

Okay.

Okay.

Ladies first.

Okay! To old friends and new experiences.

Cheers.

I haven't been
this relaxed in weeks.

Wait until that baby kicks in.

So, what did we take
with utter blind trust in you?

Pure MDMA, the slightest dash
of organically-sourced opium.

Well, way to go, Walter White.

I could never blame you, Beck.
Not even for this.

Peach is a master at her game.

Step one, get you alone
in a secluded house.

Step two, invite this Raj person over,

fill you with drugs
and get you to cheat on me.

Step three,
steal you away to Paris forever.

Had to get everything
put away and tidy for Raj, didn't you?

I need to find that gun.

So what have you been up to, Raj?

Well, you know,
finishing up medical school.

Wham, bam, get it done.

What have you been up to, Guinevere Beck?
Still writing?

You should read her poetry.
It's beguiling.

Honestly, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

I thought I did,
but lately it hasn't been so clear.

It was here.

I bet you're doing better than
you think you are.

Beck's just having a little
writer's block. It'll pass.

I want to write
a book about an injured soul.

Someone who doesn't feel like they have
a place in the world as we know it.

Someone on the outside.

You should write about my stalker.

- I love that.
- I know you do.

Peach is playing with me.
She knows I'm here. This is all a trap.

I sound crazy.

Head injury. The car.
I might be a little crazy right now.

No. No, no, no. I'm not.

I'm not. This is real.
She had a gun. Somewhere.

You're not safe.

Raj, feel how soft this feels.

It is soft.

You smell good.

So do you.

Platonic massage train! I call front!

I need a sec.
I'm spinning out.

I got you.

Is this rock bottom?
Because it sure feels like it.

Do you see now?
I would do anything for you, Beck.

I don't know why Candace followed me here.

It's like I hit my head
and bad memories jolted loose.

It's a coincidence, Beck.
You and she are nothing alike.

Nothing. Or maybe you are.
I can't tell anymore.

-How good does that feel?
-Oh, my gosh.

Ah.

Beck, run!

Can't you feel what she's doing?
What she wants?

Don't you want to run?

Maybe you don't.

- Okay, way too far.
- Yes.

-I said, "Platonic massage train."
-Oh, Beck, you're always so skittish.

Yeah, "platonic" means
friends just being friendly.

Yeah, well, I have a boyfriend.

Yes, you do. My perfect girl.

-Well, I don't.
-Me, neither.

I think I need to dance.
I'm gonna go dance.

I feel bad for Peach, really.

It's tragic not to be able to show
who you really are.

And it's turned her poisonous.

That feels good.

Okay, no.

Yeah, a little lower.

Oh, my. I bet Harry
never had to do this for Sally.

- Like that?
- Yeah.

Okay.

I have something. Okay.

Hi.

Hi.

I think I'm done
being mad at you now.

Okay, be right back.
Just gonna climb in from off this ledge...

You're cute.

I really am sorry.

I know. Joe?

Yes?

I don't want to go to Paris.

Note to self: no Paris.

Okay.
I know he's down here somewhere.

- All right.
- Um...

I swear it was here. I just used it.

Oh. Okay.

Another thing I keep learning...

- Yes.
- You got it?

Things can always get worse.

- You want this?
- I don't not want it.

Okay. Here he comes, Big Daddy.

Oh, Beck, I'm so boned.
But not as boned as Raj is about to be.

Oh, God, that's interesting.

I feel like Colonel Kurtz.

An entire night of listening
to Peach Salinger.

Over, and over, and over,
and over, and over, and over.

The horror.
One thing got me through the long night.

My mantra. You miss me.

Packed already?
We don't leave for another two days.

Yeah, about that.
I'm going back to the city.

Good. Great. You have stuff to wrap up.
And then, Paris!

Okay, I've thought about it.

Thank you, but I belong in New York.
I'm not ready to give up yet.

Give up?
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.

I mean, do you want to be an artist
or an institutionalized clichÃ©?

You're asking me to quit my MFA,

leave New York, my friends,
my relationship--

Oh, good God,
you've known him for like five seconds.

- I'm just saying that--
- Do yourself a favor.

Have some self-esteem,
and lose the creepy retail loser.

Do we have to go there?

-I'm just being real.
-Okay, you wanna be real?

What was that last night?

-What was what?
-You kissed me.

We were all rolling.

-You always do this.
-What? What do I do?

Drama out of nothing.

I mean, you were really high.

You were leaning into me,
and quite frankly, being very initiating.

-What?
-And I went with it, because, whatever.

It was a party.
I didn't want it to be weird,

'cause I'm your friend,
and that's what friends do.

That is not what happened.

Jesus Christ, Beck. Be an adult, okay?
Take a little responsibility.

Can we slow down? I'm just saying...

Shit, I'm trying to say
I am your friend, so, if--

Jesus Christ.

I know your family. I know how they are.

I know they wouldn't be okay--

No. No. I'm sorry, you have issues. Okay?

Don't make your desperate
unending need for attention about me.

This entire conversation is insane.

Okay, can we back up for one second?

I am not attacking you.
I came here to take care of you.

Of me? Oh, that's rich. It really is.

Peach, you know, Joe sees it, too.
He's been trying to tell me.

Of course Joe is behind this.

Joe is trash. Joe is nothing.

You're my family.
I'd die for you. Would he?

In a heartbeat.

I need a break.

And what?

Go slum it with a proletariat?
I give you a week.

My Uber's here.

So, what?

You're just gonna abandon me
when I need you the most?

What about my stalker?

I'll text you the number
of a private security company. Call them.

I can't believe you.

After all I do for you!

You just use people!

You are good, Beck.

You're medicine.

You are the antidote for liars,

and you make cheating a distant memory,
and right now,

I love you so much,
the ringing in my head is music.

Hey!

Give me my phone!

I don't have your stupid--

I'm not cheating on you.
He's an A&amp;R guy!

I have to seem available, okay?
It's just business.

Business? We've been through this.

Yeah, we sure have.

You're lying. You cheated on me.

You broke my heart, Candace.
I let you go! Isn't that enough?

There's something wrong with you.

I thought some time away
would mellow you out,

but you're jealous, you're paranoid.
You need help!

Give...

Joseph.

Why are you in my house, Joseph?

Oh, I should've shot this Medusa
when I had the chance.

Peach, put the gun down.
I can explain.

This is breaking and entering.

I'd be totally within my rights
to shoot you right now.

I... I'm here picking up Beck.

Beck's in an Uber.
What are you doing here?

My God. You.

What?

You are my stalker.

Oh, I knew something was off about you,
and I was right.

How long have you been obsessed with me?

Don't deny it, you little shit.

You stole my Ozma, you stole my laptop,

and at this point,
I'm convinced you attacked me in the park.

Why... Wait, why would I attack you
if I'm so obsessed with you?

I don't know how your twisted mind works.
Because you're sick?

You couldn't be more wrong.

-I'm sorry.
-Oh, really?

Then why are you here, Joseph?

Why are you here, Peach? Why are you?

Beck.

Oh.

This is about Beck, isn't it?

I know what you said to her.
You got in her head,

because you can't stand to share her
with somebody so much better than you.

I mean, you were just trying
to get me out of the way.

Oh, my God.

Why are you wearing Benji's watch?

- Why are you wearing Benji's watch?
- You're right.

You're right. I stole your laptop.
I found all the files.

The ones you keep on your friends.
The ones with the naked pics of Beck.

Now, is that for blackmail,
or personal use?

It's an impressive collection.
I made copies.

Now, I have no plans to share,
but if anything happens to me,

my associate, Paco, has been instructed
to publish all the files online

and send a link
to your entire address book.

Now, we can walk away from this.

Peach, we can do that.

We can let it go.

It never happened.

Then, what?

We can go back to New York
and pretend to be friends?

If you like.

No. I don't want you near Beck.
You're dangerous.

I'm better for her than you are.

Take the ticket, Peach. Go to Paris.

Clear your head. Find a nice French girl.

'Cause you know, deep down,

she's never gonna love you
the way you love her.

Stop saying that.

She's never gonna do it.
You can't have her.

Stop saying that!

Joseph?

Family, friends, lovers,
and all the rest, forgive me for this.

But it's not like you can say
you didn't see this coming.

I've always had a complicated relationship
with my own existence.

I was given a second chance on life
after the attack in the park,

and I've decided not to take it.

I thought I could change,

and by changing myself,
alter the world around me.

But change is a fool's pipe dream.

This world is ugly and crass.
People lie and people leave,

and the beauty that does exist
is fleeting and insincere.

Still, every now and again,

someone comes along
who will make you believe in love.

And if you find that person, don't let go.

And maybe together,
you can keep the monsters at bay.

I was never that lucky.
So, I'm ending things on my own terms.

Know that I love you all...

and hope we will meet again
on the cosmic highway.

Stay amazing. Love, Peach AnaÃ¯s Salinger.

What could I do?
She was never going to let you go.

Dispatch to Nico.

Go ahead.

I ran that plate
you asked for.

Car's registered to an Ivan Mooney.
Address in Manhattan.

- Stolen?
- No. Not reported, anyway.

Thanks, Diane.

Well...

you said you owe me one.

You're lucky.
The bullet only grazed you.

I feel lucky.

You wanna talk about it?

Not really, no. If you don't mind.

A favor's a favor.

So, I took your advice. I kicked Ron out.

You were right. People don't change.

Besides, I didn't like the way
he was treating Paco.

The kid needs a real
father figure in his life,

not some drunken asshole, you know?

That was nearly a week ago.

It's been a whirlwind since then.

I thought I'd have to
explain my wounds to you,

but you didn't even notice.

I suppose I can forgive you for that,
what with your best friend dying and all.

You did ask me
to go to the funeral with you,

which I think is a good sign.

You need emotional support right now,
and that's my specialty.

So, the fridge is fully stocked.

I grabbed a couple of Xanax off Annika,
just in case.

You're going to get through this.

It'll take time, but I'll give you
as much time as you need.

And I know, once the dust settles,

you will find
you're better off without her.

You might not ever admit this, of course,

but I'll know, and that will be
all the validation I need.

I'm gonna head out.

Just text me if you need anything, okay?

Okay.

Joe?

Yeah?

Can you stay?

I can stay as long as you want.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

I love our little routine.
Always the same, but never stale.

Your father was never consistent,
and you're still healing from that.

With my help.

And guess what?
Now that I've made our mornings sacred,

you're actually writing.

One day, I'll tell you about Candace.

She broke my heart.

But you are good.

You make cheating a distant memory.

Peach is taking you out of town.

I need to save you.

License and registration?

I'm sorry, Spencer Hewitt.

Dispatch to Nico.

Car's registered to an Ivan Mooney.

I kicked Ron out.

You were right. People don't change.

Peach has it out for me.

If I just keep being
the perfect boyfriend,

you'll realize that life is
so much healthier away from this toxicity.

You have issues. Okay?

Don't make your desperate
unending need for attention about me.

It's freeing in a way,

to know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

Anyone here?

I would do anything for you.

I'm not a bad person.
She was going to ruin you.

But you're safe now. Thanks to me.

That first perfect month,

we'd been to hell and back,
we'd done the hard work,

and we were closer than ever.
We were living the dream.

Couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Couldn't keep anything off each other.

I was ready to wait it out
during the grief period,

no matter what that looked like.

But it only brought us closer together.

That month after the funeral was...

It was intimate. Real.

It just made us...

more.

But then, over the next few weeks,
something happened.

Falafel.

I couldn't tell you the exact moment
things went wrong between us,

but. uh, wrong they have gone.

So, that's why you're here in therapy,

to find out why
your relationship went south?

Oh, it didn't just go south.

It's over. And I want to know why.

Listen, here's the deal.

Don't think of this as an office
or me as a shrink.

We're just two dudes shooting the shit.

Why don't we start
when things were good with you two?

Hmm, my first kiss? Good question.

I was 14,
and I was going out with this boy, Matt.

You know, we told each other
all the good stuff.

He was so sweet.
And we went to see Hitch together.

Oh.

And I was waiting for him
to make the move.

Waiting?
So, what? That was your first kiss?

No, it was two nights later
on a school camping trip.

In a tent, in the rain.
With his best friend, Chad.

-Chad?
-I know.

- Chad?
- I know.

But Chad, he just... He went for it.

And I've always had trouble
with that kind of thing.

The whole good guy versus bad boy bit.

Don't look at me that way.
Trust me, I wish I could have a redo.

I still feel like a hootsie for it.

A "hootsie"?

That should totally be a word.

No real words?

Only fake ones.

- Punkclassical.
- Photobomb.

- Vajazzle.
- Ravey.

We connected on every level.
It doesn't get any better.

Everythingship.

I love that. It's, like, our word.

Everythingship. A noun.

A meeting of the minds, bodies and souls.

Okay, Beck. You ready?

Wait, it can't be.

Are we redoing my first kiss?

We're redoing your first kiss.

Wow.

I'm finally gonna kiss the right guy.

It was an everythingship.
It really was.

We were in a really healthy place.

I had even stopped relying on,
you know, these certain crutches.

- Crutches?
- Yeah.

Checking social media,
sneakin' a peak at a locked screen.

It was time to stop. 'Cause we were real.
I just needed to--

Trust.

Sure.

I'll see you after work.

Yeah, about that. I may have gotten fired
from the yoga studio.

May have?

I got fired.

Apparently I fell asleep leading Savasana.

It's fine. I can find another job.
I can...

Come work at Mooney's.

I know, I know. Big step.

-Joe.
-Come on. It's perfect.

Flexible hours. You have time to write.

I want to help.

I can't ask that of you.

Well, you're not asking. I'm offering.

But big steps feel right
in an everythingship.

Yeah, yeah. I get that.

Oh, don't worry about this.

I'm in early stages of asymptomatic
glaucoma, so I got a prescription.

I swear this makes me
such a better listener.

They should do a study.

So what happened next?

Oh, hey, Ethan,
do you mind taking a picture of us?

Oh...

Uh... I'm sorry,
I think I just need to sit down.

I pre-gamed the new Safran Foer
by reading Eating Animals,

and I'm test-driving veganism now
and I'm just feeling a little faint.

Oh...

Of course.

You two are absolutely adorable,
and I am a lonely, vegan island.

Someone needs a burger.

Or somewhere to put his meat.

Okay, that was bad.
I meant it sympathetically.

-We have a hashtag now?
-Too much?

It's perfect.

What happened next was
we were doing great.

It was safe to open up
about the very hardest things.

You know, uh, Peach went on a date
with JSF in high school.

I thought that grief was really
the last frontier.

Apparently he ate pork belly.
Very scandalous.

I mean, Peach always said that...

Um...

-You can talk about her, you know?
-Yeah, I know.

You haven't mentioned her
since the funeral.

It's been over a month.

And we were at that frontier together.

Actually, I think I'd rather save it
for therapy, if that's okay.

Therapy?

Except, it turns out, we weren't.

Yeah. I used to go,
about a year ago, but I stopped.

But then after Peach, I thought it was...

worth it to go for a bit.

Honestly, Dr. Nicky's been really helpful
dealing with my grief.

I think we need more stars.
They're in your office, right?

Yeah.

Don't get me wrong.

There's nothing wrong
with going to therapy. It's just...

It's a bit troubling when your partner
hides something from you.

Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?

I hear you, Paul. Not cool.

Forgive me, Beck,

but for the purposes of this session
with your therapist,

you are Renaldo, tall, dark and man-bunned
backup dancer for BeyoncÃ©.

And I, Paul, well, I manage a bar.

Every asshole in this city
has the same, not-so-special problems.

It won't be hard to hide who I am.

You two seemed pretty copacetic,
sort of...

Things were Ross and Rachel
with you and Renaldo.

Yeah, I guess they were.

Until they weren't.

See, I thought I'd eliminated
all the obstacles between us, Beck.

Benji. Peach.
But now, another has reared its head.

And he's sitting right in front of me.

All right, Paul,
let's keep digging into this.

All right, tell me, when did you see
the first cracks with Renaldo?

Well, having Renaldo at work
was amazing,

but it did force me to confront

some slightly careless aspects
of his personality.

I tried to cut him some slack.

You know, new job, and somewhere in there
he's still grieving, right?

-Hey.
-We need to talk.

About what?

Look, this is uncomfortable.
She's your girlfriend,

and, Lord knows,
I'm not one to criticize, but...

Beck is terrible, Joe. Okay?

She's always late.
She leaves the register open.

She doesn't know how to organize by genre.

Just this morning,
she chewed out a 14-year-old

for buying American Tragedy for school
because she hates Dreiser.

Everyone hates Dreiser,
but this is a bookstore, okay?

We're trying to sell books.

And I hear you, buddy.

You're caught up hard
in the tilt-a-whirl of punani.

And that is something
I struggle with every day.

But here's the thing, brother.

Shitting where you eat
just leads to confusion and E. coli.

So I'm gonna let you ruminate on that
for a little bit.

Yeah, we were a little imperfect.

But I still thought
we were in great shape.

If that was the worst of our problems.

Mooney's: Rare and Used.

This is Officer Nico,
Greenwich Sheriff Department.

I'm looking for a Mr. Ivan Mooney?

Speaking.

I'm calling about a Buick
registered to your name.

Yeah, I gave that car
to my nephew, Spencer.

Is he in trouble?

No, I was just calling about
a little fender bender he had.

It was nothing. Have a nice day.

That was too close.

I just saw my job as
keeping the outside world away

so Renaldo could heal.

Hey, Ethan said you were late again today.

Yeah, I know. Sorry.

It was hard to find a line
between boss and boyfriend.

Between supporting and enabling.

But you did say the hours were flexible,
and that I'd have time to write.

I did.
But you haven't been writing.

Thinking about writing
is a part of the process.

Okay, that sounded like bullshit
even as I said it.

I'm sorry.

The truth is,

I've been having really vivid dreams
about Peach.

I'm sorry about that.

It's not your fault. It's just...

Her face, it's...

fading, and I didn't think
that would happen so fast.

But she comes at night,

so now I am too tired to write
and falling behind at school.

And now I'm failing you
by being bad at this job.

I couldn't tell if I was helping.
I thought I was.

It's pathetic. The only good thing
in my life right now is therapy.

It's the only good thing?

Joe, don't be like that.

Or I was totally wrong

and there were dark forces at work
I wasn't privy to.

Claudia!

There are people who are fully
delusional about their relationship.

-Claudia!
-Get your scrub-ass outta here, Ron.

Karen, stop being a meddling bitch
and tell me where Claudia is.

For example,
my neighbor's alcoholic boyfriend

literally has to be chased away
with a baseball bat.

This isn't over, Karen.
You can't hide forever, Claudia!

-Do I know you?
-No.

You don't know me at all?

-No.
-Then what're you staring at?

But we were different, I thought.

It sounds like working with Renaldo
at the bar wasn't such a hot idea, huh?

I mean, sure,
it was difficult to navigate at times.

But it had its good parts.

Beck.

Beck.

âª Unwind your watch âª

âª Shut your eyes a minute âª

âª 'Cause your heart killed mine âª

âª But now I close the distance âª

-Hi.
-Hi.

What is this?

I thought we could use
a little date night.

Meatball subs. Your favorite.

Well? What do you think?

I think one errant candle could destroy
an entire collection of rare books.

But...

you...

are worth it.

I feel bad for girls who don't eat.

It always made me sad with Peach.

What?

Uh, you're talking
about Peach. It's good.

Yeah, I guess so.

You know, I had this Little Mermaid
sleeping bag when I was a kid.

God, I loved that thing.
But then it started to smell.

Bad. Like fungus bad.

I couldn't bring myself
to get rid of it, though.

-A security blanket.
-Exactly.

But then I lost it.
And even though I was sad,

I was kind of relieved because I didn't...

I didn't actually have to get rid of it.

And it's the same with Peach.
There is a part of me...

Oh, God, it sounds terrible.

Not that I am comparing Peach
to a cheap nylon sleeping bag. I...

This metaphor made a lot more sense
when I came to it with Dr. Nicky.

I think all this Peach stuff is coming up
because of my birthday.

December 3rd.

You remember.

'Course.

Anyway, Peach made such a big deal
about birthdays.

And she always made sure
I felt super special

and would plan the whole thing and...

now I don't...

-I'll handle it.
-No, Joe--

No, what do you want?
A night at the Met?

The tasting menu at Momofuku?

Hell, I'll even sing karaoke
with Annika and Lynn.

That's sweet.
That's really, really sweet. But I...

I think I'd rather keep it
low-key and small.

No. No to small. No to low-key.

I don't know, Lynn.
Beck was pretty emphatic.

Dude, Beck's a Sagittarius.
She craves attention.

This is a test, okay?

Part of the fun is making a guy think
that you don't want something

and seeing if he still comes through.

-No, Beck's not like that.
-Let me give you a little lesson on Beck.

Every year, she wants to "keep it simple."

And every year, whatever guy
that she's dating royally blows it.

And Peach swoops in on her Manolos
and throws Beck a party for the ages.

Only now, no Peach.
God rest her beautiful soul.

So you're saying throw a party?

I'll help.

I need a distraction.

And I think
because I was anxious about this,

my judgment was a little off.

If I bury my sorrows
in any more booze and boys,

I'm gonna get syphilis. Again.

And Annika's still at Esalen
on her grief retreat, so...

But she didn't like Peach.

None of us liked Peach.

But we loved her.

Losing a friend is super complicated, Joe.
I need this. Beck needs it.

Which is why I was stupid enough

to think Renaldo's friends
should be listened to, ever.

It'll just be some friends,
some NYU people.

We'll make it a surprise party.

Hmm? A book theme.

And everyone can come dressed
as their favorite literary character.

What do you say?

Put it to you this way.

Would you rather do something
and be wrong,

or nothing and be wrong?

Surprise party?

Mmm. I thought it would cheer him up
after the death of his beloved Shih Tzu.

Get his mind off of things.

And?

Did it?

It was the beginning of the end.

Because you threw him a surprise party?

No, because that's when I realized
he was cheating on me with his therapist.

Oh, shit. You scared me.

- What's all this?
- Uh...

It's my girlfriend's birthday.
I'm throwing her a little...

Well, it's not so little.
It's a surprise party.

Kind of a literary theme. Thus...

I'm going as Ernest Hemingway.

Old Man and the Sea. The Sun Also--

I know who Hemingway is.

Nice cake.

She's lucky to have a man who cares.

Facon-wrapped date? Facon-wrapped date?
Facon-wrapped date?

- Thanks, man.
- Good call.

Facon-wrapped date?

It's 9:40. Beck was supposed to be here
at 9:00 to meet for dinner.

She'll be here. Relax.

You know what you need,
my friend, is a drink.

Hey, get this man a Catcher in the Rye.

No, no, no. It's fine.

- She's here!
- Oh!

Everyone, hide.
Places, people. Hide!

Surprise!

How American.

Who is that?

That's one of Beck's school friends,
I think. I don't know. I'm texting her.

I would have guessed, yeah.

What?

Rude to stare,
especially in Asian cultures.

Mr. Darcy, I take it?

-Indeed.
-Predictable.

Says Elizabeth Bennet.

God, no. Dorothea Brooke.

Middlemarch.
Named my shelter cat after George Eliot.

I love her.

-The cat or the author?
-Both.

Meow.

Hi, hey, I'm sorry.
Can we chat for second?

Oh, Joe, Joe, this is Constantine.
He lives in Bushwick.

That's fine. Where the hell is Beck?

Do you want to touch his mustache?

No. No, no. Lynn. No, Lynn,
I don't want to touch his mustache.

- Joe--
- I don't get it.

I've tried to be the perfect boyfriend.
I've bent over backwards.

I gave her a job. I threw her this party.

-What else can I do?
-People are puzzling.

Peach committed suicide
and she is the strongest person I know.

Knew.

Beck isn't just puzzling.
She's impossible.

Like, where is she right now?
It's selfish. It's rude.

- But it's Beck and that--
- Joe.

- Ah, shit. Hey!
- Surprise!

Can I speak to you for a sec?

Joe, this is not what I asked for.
I said quiet and I said small.

-Right, yeah. Lynn said--
-Oh, now you're listening to Lynn?

In retrospect, a misfire.

-Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
-I'm Hemingway. Again, misfire.

Look, I appreciate the gesture. I just...

I can't be at a party and pretend
that everything is okay without Peach.

I am not a robot.

Well, what about the other day?
The relief you talked about?

Grief isn't a straight line, Joe.

I know.
You've just been hard to read lately.

What is that supposed to mean?

-Where were you?
-I'm sorry?

Beck, I called. I texted you.

Yeah, I know, I just...
My, um... My therapy session ran long.

Dr. Nicky and I were really
making some headway.

And then I guess I just...
I went for a walk and...

-You guess? Therapy and a walk?
-Yes.

Then why do you smell
like three glasses of rosÃ©?

Because I sat down at some stupid bar
with my journal

trying to work through shit, Joe.
That's it.

-Okay, so then why didn't you call me?
-I forgot.

But it's your birthday, Beck.
We made dinner plans.

Well, I just... I lost track of time.

Shit.

Beck, just tell me.

Just tell me. Tell me the truth.

And we can get through anything.

Okay, if you can't tell me, then show me.
Show me your phone.

Are you serious right now?

You said yourself,
you have a hard time with good guys.

-What are you talking about?
-The hootsie stuff.

Okay, I'm... Okay, fine.

You want to see my phone? Have at it.

But if you do this, it means
there is absolutely no trust between us.

And if we don't have trust,
we have nothing.

Do you trust me?

You know what? I can't do this right now.

Happy birthday to me.

âª Happy birthday to you âª

âª Happy birth... âª

With his therapist?

You're sure?
That's a pretty heavy accusation there.

How do you know?

Experience.

Candace.

There are certain tells.

You can see it in their eyes
when they look at you.

You've been cheated on before?

My last relationship.

I was blind.
I only saw what I wanted to see.

But I didn't make that mistake again.

This time I made sure
that Renaldo was different.

So I knew if he was lying or cheating,

then someone was using him.

Look, I'm not one of those shrinks
that are obsessed with the past,

but I think in this case,
we should take a look.

Why don't you tell me
about your childhood?

But we're not here
to talk about my childhood, right?

We're talking about my relationship.

Which ended because of a surprise party?

No. That's not when it ended.

I brought you a donut.

It's glazed.

Oh, hold up.
So you were just back together?

Regardless of your suspicions?

Mmm, didn't matter. That was the past.

All right, so, what happened next?

Things were good at first.

But then, it started to feel
like something was different.

I feel like I'm hungrier than sushi.

-Okay, pizza?
-Too saucy.

-Thai?
-We had Thai for lunch.

Why do I always have to pick?

It's okay. I'll choose.

It's a horrible feeling.

To know things have gone wrong,

and there's nothing
you can do to change it.

Falafel.

You know something or someone
has come between you.

But I had to be sure.

-I'll see you after class, okay?
-Okay. Bye.

Heart. Heart. Heart.

I wanted to be wrong.

I never wanted to be wrong
so badly in my life.

I was begging to be proven wrong.

But it was looking like I was right.

You trust someone.

You give them your heart,
and what do they do?

Is there even a punishment
that fits the crime of lying,

of manipulating like this?
Of breaking someone's heart?

I guess I'm bad at picking good people.

But I'm good at catching
bad people red-handed.

Are you following me?

Answer me right now.
Were you following me?

No, no, no.

I was in the neighborhood
and then I saw you.

God, stop lying.

No, just... tell me why. Why, Joe?

It's the being late, the secret texts.
You've been different, Beck.

You're being crazy.

Are you sleeping with him?

Who?

-Your therapist.
-Oh, my God.

Are you? I need to know! I want to know!

No! I am not sleeping with him.

Who's the fox?

-What?
-The fox. The fox, Beck!

My friend. Emma Fox. From Brown.

But I guess that wasn't readily apparent
on the texts from my phone, huh?

-Beck--
-Don't.

Joe, I told you.
If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

I know. I know. I'm sorry.

Me, too.

You and I, we're over.

And that... That's when it ended.

That's one hell of a story.

-What's your diagnosis?
-My diagnosis?

Yeah, yeah. What do you make of it all?

Well, you might think I'm crazy

'cause I've only known you
48 minutes, but...

I think there's two of you.
Two Paul Browns.

One that's been hurt in the past,
feel betrayed and hopeless.

But the other one has faith,

and in spite of the evidence
to the contrary,

he believes true love exists.

And that is someone I think I can help.

Our time is up now,

but I'd be down to seeing you again,
if you'd like.

I don't think so.

Everything I do,
I do to protect you, Beck.

Peach, Benji, they left me no choice.

They were dangerous.

I think you might be in danger again.

But I need absolute proof first.

And these days,
the quickest way to a man's truth...

is through his computer.

And if I find what I'm looking for,

Dr. Nicky will be handled.

I mean, he followed me.
That's just... It's not okay.

I get it. You feel violated.

Pretend I'm Joe, okay?

What would you say to him right now?

The more you want me,
the less I want you.

I know it's messed up, but it's true.

Of course you think I'm hiding shit. I am.

Hiding what a complete, ugly mess I am,

behind this, like, cute,
acceptable version of being a mess.

It's insane.

I haven't dealt with the shit
that went on with me and Peach.

Or my dad. Or Benji.

And instead of putting it into my writing,

I'm hibernating with you.

And I resent you for it.

I need space to heal.

But every time I turn around,
you're standing there,

ready to make it all okay.
But only I can do that.

And if you really love me,
you'll see that.

You'll let me go.

Are you afraid
you might be pushing away a good thing?

Do you think Joe might be good for you?

Maybe. But it's what I need.

That doesn't sound like
an illicit affair.

That sounds like
a messed up girl in a crisis

and a pretty decent therapist
she's lucky to have.

It also sounds like you were right
to end it with me.

I was wrong about all of it.

The only thing I wasn't wrong about
was loving you.

So, I'm letting you go.

-Hey.
-Hi.

Thanks for opening the door,
all things considered.

Uh... look, there are a million things
I could say right now.

But all that matters is I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Jealousy got the best of me.

And I was threatened that you needed
someone to talk to who wasn't me.

And I know you deserve that.
You deserve to figure your stuff out.

And if I was a smarter man,
maybe I wouldn't let you go,

but I'm guessing that's what you need.

So I will.

Goodbye, Beck.

Goodbye, Joe.

Turns out, it is like the movies.

The second it's over,

all you can remember is the stuff
that made you fall in love.

Blazing through your mind,

this rom-com montage
made of the sweetest poison.

Everythingship.

I love that.

Iâd never felt this way before,

where you love the bad things
about someone...

as much as the good.

Maybe even a little more.

Love isnât a strong enough word.

And sometimes it scares me...

to love someone so completely
and not have them love you back.

I'm happy to see you here.

I didn't think you'd come back
after our last session.

Oh, that's the thing.
I don't... I don't understand it.

That's why I'm here.

-What don't you understand?
-Love.

You and seven billion other people
on this planet.

If we understood love,
I'd be out of a job.

I have to say, it's sort of unique
to everybody, like a fingerprint or...

a strand of DNA
or the song you lost your virginity to.

"Hungry Like the Wolf."

Some people have a hard time
letting love in.

Some people are built for love.

Some people... some people are searching.

Searching for someone who can love them
in the way that they deserve.

That's you.

- You look like shit.
- Thanks.

What happened?

My girlfriend dumped me, all right?

So, if you don't mind...

Mmm.

I love you, Joe.

Your face. Oh, my God.

I'm just messing with you.

Are you gonna leave Beck alone?

Or will she end up like me?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Stay away from Paco, because if you don't,

I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

You were right. I kicked Ron out.

People don't change.

Who is that?

Rude to stare,
especially in Asian cultures.

Benjamin J. Ashby.
This guy is everything wrong with America.

Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the worst.

How many guys will do anything
for the person they love?

I just want you to live your best life.
And the cost was a corpse.

You can talk about her.

Actually, I think
I'd rather save it for therapy.

It's a bit troubling when
your partner hides something from you.

Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?

I hear you, Paul.

If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

We're over.

What happened?

My girlfriend dumped me.

It's been three months
since I lost you, Beck,

and it was a loss.

But I'm in a new place. A better place.

I'm with Karen Minty.

My little neat freak. Literally.

How you can live with these
un-alphabetized, I cannot understand.

Any other system is just hostile.

What are you waiting for, babe?

Again? I don't know if--

No, pervert. Grab the typewriter.

She keeps me guessing.

She's equal parts neat and freak.

Holy shit.

I'm happy. She's happy.

We're good for each other.

Okay, she's not perfect.

You know, with a Kindle,

you can store a zillion more stories
and recipes,

and there are zero dust mites.

Oh, yeah? Your show's back on.

Yes, Queens!

Yes, King of Queens.
Nobody's perfect.

We don't share everything,
but we share the right things.

The truth is, Beck, I don't miss you

the way I thought I would.
Not since Karen.

And you, you're doing great.

Your essay about Peach went viral.
You got a book deal. Good for you.

I hardly look at your Facebook.
Two or three times a day max.

No checking your email.
I don't go by your place.

Old me would've spent
the rest of the night

trying to hunt down Mr. Anonymous,

but you're not my job anymore.

This is my job now, and I love it.

For the most part.

- What an asshole.
- I know, right?

I'm not saying
I deserve all this attention,

but "an overrated mess" is pretty harsh.

Wait. What?
I'm talking about Peach's deathbook.

This dude claiming
that she ghosted him at Coachella.

Where were you?

I had to check my comments.

Really?

Sorry I'm late, Rebecca.

There was this essay in The Believer
that would not let go of me.

Beck's not short for Rebecca.

Oh, it's a joke.
As if my last name was short for Rebecca.

Guinevere, short for Rebecca,
what did Janice say?

Who's Janice?

She's my editor.

Just call me this weekend, Beck.

"You do not sound like you.
I am not in love with these pages."

No wonder you needed me, Becky.

You make your own Yaddo.

This is no longer your home.
This is your writer's colony.

Kill all distractions.
Surrender thy phone.

My phone? Blythe...

Come on.

Goodbye, Instagram.

So long, Facebook.

Goodbye, Twitter.

I'm freeing your mind.

I can't just go dark, out of nowhere.

You're not J.K. Rowling.
We'll all be fine if you take a time-out.

Not my router! What about research?

And I'm going to ask Ethan
where Joe gets all his typewriters,

so you can be the most analog princess
in all the land.

Hey, how is Joe?

Are we really going to do that?

No, I would never want to... you know.

Yes.

Yes, just put it all on the page.

Let it flow.

I was just curious if he was still with...
Is it Karen?

-What's her last name again?
-Minty.

Minty.

Yaddo.

Minty. Yaddo.

So you don't find
yourself thinking of Renaldo at all?

No. No, that's the thing.

Yeah, he dragged me into so many messes.

With Brad, I don't have to clean up
any messes. There are no messes.

-He is--
-Simple?

No. No, he's not. No, he's just...

He knows who he is,

which means I don't have to
drive myself crazy watching his back.

-In fact, I have all this free time now--
-Crap.

We're out of time.
We'll pick this up next week?

Yes. Therapy. Karen.
This is all working.

There's many ways
to the top of the mountain, Paul.

Maybe Brad's what you need.
Maybe Brad's your Sherpa.

Enjoy the ride, man.

Maybe Dr. Nicky
is on to something, Beck.

Karen doesn't expose me to toxic people
like Benji or Peach.

Dealing with them was, ugh, stressful.

Trying to make sure
you were okay all the time...

Fine, so I still do need to know
if you're okay.

I'm happy. I want you to be happy.
It's what happy people want for people.

What the hell? No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

Where did you go?

How the hell am I supposed to be great
with you being gone

if you're actually gone?

âª All of your love
I love your love âª

âª All of your lovin', I surrender âª

âª To all the ways
Those wicked ways âª

âª The wicked way that we're together âª

âª And now I'm feeling
Like I've got a sickness âª

âª Tongue-tied and white lie addicted âª

âª I don't wanna stop for a minute âª

âª No, I'm never gonna give you up âª

âª It's heavy âª

âª Heavy how I want you so bad âª

âª Heavy when it hits me so fast âª

âª Heavy and it's driving me mad âª

Desperate Characters. Number Seven?
Is that all I am to you?

You get a book deal because of me,
because, let's face it, Peach died.

And you wrote about her death.

And that's just not something
you would have done if she were alive.

I was so damn happy with Karen.

But I'm not sure I can be happy
if I don't know you're happy.

- What? Yes!
- Yeah.

- Yes!
- Yes! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Joe!

This is on you, Beck.
You put Blythe and Ethan together

and you left me to deal with them.

The most spectacular thing
just happened for us.

We're moving in together.
Ethan just asked me. Just right now.

I mean, you know what they say.
When you know, you know.

Inspiration calls. Goodbye, love.

You are insane to move in with her
this quickly. You barely know her.

I don't know.
I mean, you love who you love,

and love tells you what to do. Easy peasy.

Stupid, stupid.

You just... You don't always know
how it's gonna work out.

Sure you do.
Look how happy you are with Karen.

Well, good luck finding a place.
The market's shit right now.

Okay, I'm not worried.
The law of attraction. When you know...

I know.

If I could go anywhere, I'd probably go
to New Zealand, to see Mordor.

When you know, you know.

I would go to Paris. Paris all the way.
Wouldn't have to think about it.

What about you, Joe?

Yeah, I've never been to Paris.

I'm going to Six Flags this weekend.
Have you guys been there?

Six Flags? Really, Pac?

Mom's a new person since Ron's gone.

Sorry, sorry. I get in the elevator,
and we stop on every single floor.

I'm telling you, it was like,
12, 11, 10...

Is this Italian? Yeah, no, thanks.

Hey, Claudia?

You should put something in your stomach,
you know? Something else?

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm not the bad guy here.

Hijo, Mami changed her mind. We're going.
Let's go. Grab what you want.

Bye.

See you, Pac.

At least now we know she's on something.

I'm sorry I ruined dinner.

Serves me right for trying to help.

No, Karen.

You are so good.

You, too, babe.

"Babe." You said "babe" was
a default for unimaginative lovers.

But then, you never cared for people
the way Karen does.

You were so caught up in you,
you never thought to take care of me.

And honestly? It's worth all the "babe."

This is too sad. You wanna take a walk
to a Froyo truck or something?

Froyo sounds lovely.

For me, it's like,
just how present he is, you know?

-It speaks volumes about his heart.
-I know.

-He just looks you right in the--
-Reading Lord of the...

Joe! I, uh...

-Right. This is your hood.
-Right.

I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Beck.

Karen.

-Congrats on the book deal.
-Thanks.

I'm actually having some writer's block.

Thought I'd take a walk around the block.

You live near here?

No, I just... I like it around here.

I'm listening to that podcast
you told me about--

Podcasts. The droning.
Just get to the point, you know?

-Yeah...
-Babe, I'm starving.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's...
Walk safe, Beck.

You, too!

Bye, Karen.

Ugh. Hello?

"Walk around the block."

You thought you'd disappear

and I'd show up at your door
screaming how I can't live without you.

Well, take a look, babe. This is me,
living without you. I don't need you.

Wait, hold up.

Hey, that was
the everythingship girl, right?

Ex-everything. Yeah.

What? No. I'm coming in tomorrow night,
and she is taking over for tonight. Yes.

- What can I get for you?
- Hi.

Oh, no. I know before I know.

I should delete you.

I'm with Karen, and you're right.
She is nice.

I should ignore you. I will.

Oh. Damn.

So, you're talking to Joe again?

Not talking. Just texting.

How much?

Couple times.

A day.

All right, you want me to give you
shrink bullshit

like, "how does that make you feel?"

Or do you wanna get real about this

and admit this is something you do,
and we should take a real look at it?

I'm not falling for Renaldo.
I'm not going down that road again.

Are you trying
to convince me of that or you?

No. It's...

It's innocent. I bumped into him.

I could tell that he missed me, so I...

I texted him. To be nice.

Okay. Walk me through this,
will you, Paul?

Now, Renaldo sends you the first text,

and you know this is already something
that you've put to bed, and?

Congrats again.

Also, the asshole on Medium
who called you overrated? Just jealous.

So, do you want to see
my potential author photos?

I suppose I am an expert.

Here I come.

Friends.

Just friends.

So what are you reading right now?

I haven't opened it up yet.
Have you?

I have been there
and it didn't work out.

To say the least. We know this.

Sounds to me
like you're flirting.

I'm not flirting with him.

He's with the wrong girl.

I mean, his new girlfriend, she's...
She puts stickers on pictures.

And they've been together
three months, right?

I mean, her profile, her life?

It's all bachelorette parties
and fortune cookies and blood...

blood drives.

What if Joe likes those things?

They're not Joe things.

The one thing I know from sitting
in this chair all these years

is that the only people
that know a relationship to the core

are the people
that are in that relationship.

Well, if that's true,

then why don't I know what's going on
with Brad and me?

Last week, I was happy.

This week, I'm comparing everything.

Like, um, Brad calls me "babe."

All right? Renaldo and I used to make fun
of people who say "babe."

Now I'm babe? Like,
how does one just become babe?

I'm gonna give you a metaphor, okay?
Think of your relationship as a house.

And that's Brad and me.

There's a mouse in that house.

I'm the mouse?

Well, I'm not one of those people
who would ever kill a mouse.

No, you're not going to.
You're gonna focus on your house.

The house that you built for you and Brad.

Forget about the mouse.
The mouse is a pest.

Okay, so, as the mouse, I'm just supposed
to walk away? Leave the alleged house?

So, that's it. Just stop texting.

Brad is good for me.
I like the house, our house.

Yeah. I think you
do like your house, Paul.

But what if I know for a fact
this man wants this mouse?

Maybe he does.

How do people catch mice?

In a trap.

And isn't one of the reasons
why you guys fell apart

is because he made you feel...

Trapped. Oh, come on.

I'm just saying, I could metaphor
circles around you all day long.

I have great metaphors.

But I think you know
what I'm driving at, Beck.

Law of attraction.

Ethan and Blythe scored a place
the day they went looking.

So, they bask in the knowledge
that the universe is on their side,

and I get roped into a quote,
moving party, end quote,

which is not a thing.

Note to self. Make new friends.

- Hey!
- Oh, no.

-Sorry I'm late.
-You're kidding me.

-Let me help you with that.
-Oh, it's okay. I got it.

Of course no one mentioned
you were coming.

The last time I saw you in that shirt...

Blythe didn't tell you
she blackmailed me into this?

...you were bent over
the bookstore counter at 2:00 a.m.

I'm not thinking about that.

And suddenly I miss texting,

because you in the actual room
does things to me that I can't control.

-Is Karen here?
-She's working.

âª Something tells me
Mine is not the first... âª

Yes, you smell good.
Your heat. Your sweat.

But Karen brings out the best in me
and you bring out the worst.

Your knees, your legs.
They're just knees. They're just legs.

âª You're power trippin' âª

âª Yeah âª

âª You're power trippin' now âª

âª You're power trippin' âª

Hey.

Oh, thanks.

Apparently we've been invited

to the Swedish word
for a housewarming party on Thursday.

You know, I have to admit
I had my initial doubts about them,

but they're adorable together.

Obnoxiously cute.

Cheers.
To the Joe and Beck moving company.

We may be just okay...

But we work for free.

How's writing going?

Harder than I thought.

Well, that's true of all things in life
that are good for you. Don't you think?

Like moving a whole house of tasteful,
yet surprisingly heavy furniture?

No, you know what I mean.

So, have you been to Staten Island yet?
You know, to meet the Mintys?

You looked me up.

I guess that means
that you're back on Facebook.

Which means you noticed I was off.

Hey, I am just looking out for my friend.

Babe.

Babe. You had to do it?

Claudia, honey, can you hear me?
Claudia?

Ugh, she's completely out of it.
Hand me that blood pressure cuff.

Girl, what did you do?

What is this?

-Should we take her to a hospital?
-So she can lose her job? Hell no.

She could lose everything, Joe.
She could lose Paco.

She's not dying.
She's just very strung out.

She just needs a couple of days to detox.
Get out the woods.

And you know what?
She deserves that chance.

Addiction is a monster.

It doesn't care
if you're a good nurse, a good mother.

I don't want Paco to see this.

Do you get claustrophobic easily?

Quite the little detox dungeon
you got here.

Mooney would kill me for this.

Benji already destroyed ten grand
in inventory in here.

-You sure she's gonna be okay?
-I got this.

Uh-oh. She's waking up. In a cage.

- No! No, what are you doing to me?
- Hold her. Okay, Joe?

I would freak out, too.

Hold her down. I got a sedative.

- Hurry up, Karen.
- What are you doing?

- Hold her down.
- Let go of me!

- I'm trying to help you.
- No!

Like Benji freaked out.

Anyone would.

And he died in this cage.
His corpse was right here. I killed him.

I got you, girl.
I'll be here when you wake up.

Karen's got this. Claudia's not
gonna die in this cage, like Benji.

Benji's body. The smell. I did that.

I'm not a killer. No one else
is dying in here. I'm not a killer.

-Jesus, Joe.
-I'm sorry.

I told you I got this.

Sorry, babe. Sometimes detox is messy.

Oh, Beck. She has no idea
how messy this could get.

They're still at the spa?

Yeah, you know how you love Six Flags?
Well, this is...

really just like their version
of Six Flags.

Are you telling the truth?

I wish I was telling the truth.

I'm always telling the truth.

I thought I was sleeping there.

Nah, you get the bed.

I do?

Thanks, Joe.

I hope she's having fun. Mom.

She is.

You know she loves you.

She always says
love is what really makes a family.

Well, if that's true,
then you can count me and Karen, too.

Which means I have the authority
to tell you to get to bed.

Get to bed, young sir.
Brush your teeth.

I got the ice chips.

Thank you. You're a godsend.
Here, honey.

You're gonna feel better soon, okay?

He's back.

He's back.

Who's he? What? Is she okay?

She thinks this place is haunted.

Impossible.

Benji was too lazy to run
his own business, let alone haunt mine.

There you go, honey. Let it go.

Hi, Ron. Can I help you?

I'm looking for Claudia.

Well, she's not here.

But you know where she is.

How the hell does he...
Oh, he doesn't. He's testing me.

I'm sorry, I don't.

Well, it's not like her
not to text me back.

She told me that you two broke up.

Is that what she said?

Not quite self-defense.

No one would believe
he was robbing the place.

A parole officer. Respectable.

Can't say he wouldn't deserve it.

I'll mention that you swung by
when I see her, if you'd like.

Thank you. You do that.

Karen has Claudia handled.
Karen sent me home.

Karen kind of doesn't need me.

Hey. Can I steal you
for an hour tomorrow,

maybe rent your brain?

I could use a reader and some sea breeze.

No. I shouldn't. I won't.

It's a date.

Shit! It's fine.

You're not heroin. You're a human woman.

We're friends. I have self-control.

And besides, what could happen

on the upper deck of an immensely popular
tourist destination?

In a word, wow.

It's such a relief to hear that.

I must have rewritten the end
a dozen times.

I've been in lock-down, torturing myself,
trying so hard.

I was starting to spin out, you know?

More than you realize, Beck.

The fresh air helps.

Karen is good.
I need to be good for Karen.

I think I'll write another one
from the male perspective.

Hmm.

Assuming I can procure your services
on an as-need basis.

Karen is good. I need to be good.

Let's give it a shot.
What do you think I'm thinking right now?

Please move further away.

Mmm... I think I know
what you're thinking.

Or move closer.

Yeah?

No, don't move closer.

I think...

you're thinking what I'm thinking.

We can't do this.

We're not gonna do this.
We are not doing this, Beck.

Well, that was a mistake.

-Never again.
-Ever.

Never again. Again.

Never again. Again.

Nicky, I'm so sorry,
but I have to cancel.

Don't worry.
I am very much not in that house anymore.

Nicky, my man, it's Paul.
Hey, what can I say?

Your advice worked wonders.
There's no mouse in my house.

You make me weak, Beck.

Karen's handling Claudia,

and I'm a bad person
because I'm letting her,

while I'm letting you handle me.

My neighbors are gonna hate me.

Paco.

Oh. Shit!

I was supposed to handle Paco.

You're a drug, Beck.
You're worse than pills.

I am worse than Claudia.

I gotta go.

-Wait, what did I do?
-I'm sorry. It's nothing.

All right.

Everything, Beck.
Once again, you swallow me whole.

You make me forget everything else,
and other people pay the price for it.

Oh! Pac, I'm sorry I'm late.
There's another showing, if you wanna go.

I wanna see my mom.

Stop lying. Where is she, Joe?

She's okay. I promise.
But trust me, you're better off here--

Don't say that.

You have no idea what's better.
She's my mom.

I do get it. Okay? I do.
My mom used to disappear all the time.

She had problems. All moms have...
All people have problems.

She just has to deal
with some stuff. Okay?

She's coming home as soon as she can.

She didn't say goodbye.

She always says goodbye.

Hey, I didn't know you were
coming back tonight. Where's Paco?

What are you thinking?
It's one more day. Two tops.

-He needed to see her.
-No, he didn't.

Mom.

Oh!

Baby.

Baby, I'm so sorry.

It's okay, Mom. You have to get better.

I swore I wasn't gonna get sick again
and then I did.

This is it. I'm gonna change.

I just need... I need a little while
to get my shit together,

and then I'm going home,
and I'm all yours, mijo.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to put on a kid.

I know. But he needed this.

All right, mister.
Take Paco home. Make him do his homework.

I'll stay here till she falls asleep.

Then I can meet you at
the housewarming party for a few minutes.

You want to go to that?

Blythe is... She's a little out there,
and Ethan's a talker.

I wouldn't be offended

-if it's not your scene.
-I wanna go.

I'm burnt out.
And this place is kind of creepy.

-No offense.
-Mmm.

None taken.

Personally, I'm of the opinion

that all penetration under patriarchy
is rape, and so before I...

Oh, Blythe. Beck, Blythe.
Are you here?

I've never wanted someone to appear
yet not appear so badly.

...in addition
to watching BeyoncÃ©'s Lemonade...

I'm a junkie. It's better to just
not have access to a fix.

My methadone. Thank God.

...had to hire a literal homeless person,
off the street, to help us move it.

-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

You must be Blythe.

I am, because I must.

Blythe!

Percival! Back from the ashram.
Tell me everything. How was it?

Isn't that Beck?

Oh. Beck and a bottle of booze.
What could go wrong?

Yes.

Little Karen Minty, how are you?

I mean, uh...
Sorry, I mean little as a compliment.

I'm sorry.
I've had a few.

Cheers to that, lady.

Hey, uh, can you help me
open a couple of bottles?

I have butterfingers,
'cause earlier I was touching butter.

If I leave them alone,
they'll talk about me.

Christ, babe, go. If you don't leave,
we can't talk about you.

Hmm.

- He's such a good guy, right?
- The best.

My heart just fills up
when I see him with Paco.

Most guys don't give a shit, but Joe...

Joe will do absolutely anything
for someone he loves.

The heart in him, you know?

I'm so happy for you guys.
Will you, uh, excuse me?

What did Karen tell you?
What did you tell Karen?

Leaving you alone together was a bad idea.

Hey.

Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

Stop.

Do you think either of us can stop?

What we're doing is wrong.

But...

I didn't get it, but now I see it.
I really see it.

See what?

You are so good for me.
I mean, you helped me so much, and...

you're the best thing that ever happened
to my writing, which is everything.

But...

But the world is twisted, and unfair,
and let's face it...

I am no good for you.

But Karen Minty is.

And I am jealous.

And I wish I did things differently.

I wish I hadn't shut down
after Peach died.

And I hadn't pushed you away.
But, I think it...

It came from how scared I was to need you.

But...

I am a mess,
and you deserve better.

You deserve to be with someone
who's perfect for you.

You're right.

Thank you.

No thanks needed.

You're right, Beck.
Karen is good for me.

And we just saved someone's life together.

That alone should tell me
I'm in the right place.

Karen is perfect.

It's over.

-No, it's just a commercial.
-No, no, no, no, no.

Our it. Us.

You're dumping me.

No, I'm not dumping you. You're amazing.

I'm amazing, but you kind of, what,
don't wanna do me anymore?

Look, there's never a good time to--

Do not talk for a minute, please.

We're a good team. I see that.
I just... There's something missing.

I don't know what it is.
I wish I could buy it.

I wish I could buy it at the store
and take it home. But I can't.

Oh, she's gonna slap me.

My curling iron.

No? Okay.

So, you're okay?

We're adults. It happens.

I'm not stupid, okay?
I knew something was off.

- Now she's gonna slap me.
- Oh.

Uh, I mean, maybe we should talk?

Okay, then.

That's it.

Of course she takes the high road.
She knew all along.

Karen and I don't see the world
the same way.

But you? You, Beck?

This is it.
This is that moment in the movie.

This is when I run through the rain
to win you back.

Okay, it's not raining,
but this is the run in the rain.

This is where I declare to you...

You got me, babe!

Beck!

No, I'm sorry.
I just... I meant to tap it.

I'm sorry.

What the hell, Joe?

I was thinking about what you said
at the party.

You're pushing me away
because you think it's the right thing.

It is. It's the right thing.

No, the right thing is to be with
who you should be with.

Even if it's messy. You make it work
because you know you belong together

and I know we belong together.

So, you tell me you know it, too...

and you got me.

Yes. Get up here.
But take the stairs.

The drama.

What are you gonna do next?

Torch the place
the next time we have a fight?

For you...

My dear, for you...

...the drama is worth it.

I got good news.

My editor loved my new pages.

I was so happy,
and all I wanted to do was call you.

And share it with you.

Well, it's a good thing
I showed up with that rock, then.

She's not gonna let you in, man.
You don't know what she's been through.

I heard you helped.

Thank you.

Hey.

This was never Ron's fault.

You can't be serious.

He helps us every day.

-You call that help?
-Yeah, I do.

-I can't do this alone.
-Claudia, you're not alone.

Karen was right.
Addiction is a monster.

You lied to me.

Paco, I didn't lie--

You said things would get better.

You said I had you and Karen--

-You do. Just because we're apart--
-Karen's gone!

She's switching jobs.

She's mad at my mom for Ron,
and we're never gonna see her again.

Well, that's not gonna last. I promise--

You can't promise!

You say you wanna help, but you can't!
Can you, Joe?

Everything is worse.

Hey. I needed to hear your voice.

In a totally non-obsessive,
casual sort of way. Call me, please.

Karen, hi.

Do you work around here?

No, just walking around the block.

I won't keep you.
I just had to say thank you.

I owe you.

For what?

Turns out you're my
get-out-of-Joe-free card.

You... You showed me who he really is.

And that is?

Besides a liar and a cheater?

I really have to go.

Of course. Just be careful.

I got a feeling you're no Candace.

Okay. What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

Hey, look, I couldn't fill in
the ex shoes either.

Whoever this girl is,
she's still got her claws in him.

Well, this has been fun.
You got to play the spiteful ex.

Now, let's just say goodbye.

Yeah, I'm sure you two will be fine.
Of course, you gotta know.

What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

Or worse.

Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

Enjoy it while it lasts, Beck.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

The only good thing
in my life right now is therapy.

It's a bit troubling when
your partner hides something from you.

-Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?
-I hear you, Paul.

-Are you sleeping with him?
-Who?

Your therapist.

No! I am not sleeping with him.

If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

We're over.

Karen is perfect.

I've never wanted anything more.

Except you, Beck.

-It's over.
-You're dumping me.

Joe Goldberg?
I heard about you and Candace.

She thought she could be happier
with some guy in Rome.

It's just how she left so suddenly...

Are you gonna leave Beck alone?
Or will she end up like me?

-He never talks about Candace.
-You must sleep deeper than I do.

What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

Or worse.

Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

Candace.

Candace.

Candace!

Candace!

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry!

Candace!

Candace!

Thank God you had
that third glass of pinot.

I want to wake you so you can hold me.

But then you might ask
what I've dreamt about.

And it doesn't matter, Beck.

What matters is what's real. This.

Us.

Goddess of war. Seven letters.
Athena?

Oh, no, that's six.

Ishtar? No. No, no, no.
Freyja. What about Freyja? Freyja?

Or you could try seven letters.

Okay, here. Can I see it?

Yeah, okay...

Oh!

Sekhmet. Yeah. S-E-K-H...

No, she's an Egyptian goddess. What?

Nothing. I just...

I like watching you reach into
your mind palace

for random bits of information.

I like it when you say
things like "mind palace."

In mine, by the way, you're the queen.

-Oh, wow!
-Yeah, right?

I missed this. Our routine.

Unless, of course, this is what you do
with all your girlfriends.

All of them. The whole harem.

How many have there been, by the way?

Girlfriends? Really? Haven't we done this?

I mean, besides Karen,
you've only told me about one.

What's her name,
who went to, like, Europe?

God, what was her name?

You know her name because you heard
me calling it last night, didn't you?

Now you want to know more.
Of course you do.

Why would I call another woman's name
in my sleep?

Oh, Candace, right?

Is this a problem?

-Yeah.
-She still in France or wherever?

Uh, Italy. And I don't know.
I don't really care.

Well, why did you guys break up?

This is a problem.

Because she dumped me.
Because we were thoroughly incompatible.

The night you pulled me
from the train tracks,

you said you went chasing a girl.
Was that her?

Yeah, and it was really dumb of me.

The truth is, some people seem to function
to show you what isn't right for you.

And others...

show you exactly what is.

Saved for now. But I know you.

You won't stop asking questions
until I do something about this

and stop dreaming about Candace.

How do you exorcise someone?

A shaman? A hypnotist?

We can't sleep another night
with a ghost in our bed.

Hey, I forgot.
I have to run payroll up to Mooney today.

So I'm gonna have to rain check on lunch
with the girls. Is that all right?

-Yeah, that's fine.
-Okay, great.

Don't lie to me, babe!

I know you got the messages.

Please, just meet with me. Hear me out.

Apparently, the Doc's got
lady problems of his own.

Sorry about that, Paul.

Is everything okay?

-With--
-Yeah. Yeah.

So, uh... you've been having these dreams.
When did they start?

Uh, just right after Renaldo
and I broke up.

Right. And you broke up with Renaldo
because he cheated on you.

So now you're having dreams of your
previous ex in the arms of another man.

But it makes sense losing Renaldo
would kick all that back up, right?

But Renaldo wasn't cheating,
as it turns out.

In fact, we're back together now,
and things are better than ever.

Okay. So you wanna know
why the dreams haven't stopped?

Exactly.

Can you think of why
you don't want to face your ex?

I don't think I understand the question.

Well, in your dream,
you say you're trying to reach him.

But you can't because
you put yourself in a cage.

I don't put myself in a cage.
I find myself in the cage.

Whose dream is this?

See, we are the architects
of our own dream.

You have some unfinished business
with your ex and you need to deal with it.

Trust me.

If you don't deal with this,
if you don't face it,

it will haunt you, man.

Uh, yes, face Candace.
I'd sooner slam my nuts in a door.

But anything to stop screaming her name
in my sleep.

Come on, asshole. I'm hungry.

Terry, are you kidding me?

Here. Here, here.

Can I help you out with that?

My hero.

You guys playing here tonight?

Yeah, if I don't starve to death
before then.

You should actually come see us play.
We put on a pretty good show.

-We're Heathcliff's Misery.
-Wuthering Heights?

Very good. I'm Candace.

Oh. Hey, I'm Joe.

Thanks for your help, Joe.

My pleasure, Candace.

Fucking Candace. I mean, look at her.

No wonder he's dreaming about her.

She's got this whole icy redhead,

"Follow me into this cave, Jon Snow" vibe.

Okay, if you think
I post a lot of selfies...

And she's not even Joe's type.

I thought he was only into
mildly slutty smart girls.

So funny.

I mean, honestly,
she hasn't posted in a year.

This account's not even active.

She ran off to Italy. Allegedly.

Why do you even care about this chick

if y'a'll are in mad love
and she's in Italy?

Well, we don't know if she even is.

I mean, she could secretly be here
and they could be banging.

Or he is still in love with her.

He's telling her that she's his forever
and I'm just his right now,

and then he feels guilty
for being with me.

Okay, can we talk about
what you're really doing here?

No. I know what you're gonna say.

Babe. Your career is taking off.
You're falling for a genuinely good guy.

And you think that there must be
something wrong.

Because good things must be taken away
from Guinevere Beck.

Yeah. Hashtag, daddy issues.

Oh, my God. You guys are so right.

Is that the guy?

- Yeah, it's totally the guy.
- Is he following us?

Hi. Hello. Hi.

Douchey man. Hi.

Do you want to join us?
'Cause there's room.

- That's what I thought.
- Oh, God, what a dick.

What does he think, one of us killed her?

What are you talking about?
Who is that guy?

He hasn't talked to you? Peach's family
hired him to look into her death.

- Like a PI?
- Yeah.

It's all her mother.
God forbid the ladies at the club

think her perfect daughter killed herself.

- What?
- Ugh. She was doomed.

Her whole family's House Slytherin.

Oh, shit.
We're gonna be late to cryo.

-Becks, last chance.
-I wish. I have to, um, send Blythe notes.

Well, have fun. Love you.

- Bye.
- Later.

- Smooches.
- Let's just...

-Bye.
-Bye.

You mean Bushnell?
Yeah, I love Candace Bushnell.

Although, honestly,
I can't really stand SJP.

You know who I mean. Joe's Candace.

Yeah, I just don't really
want to get into it.

- Why?
- Where is Joe?

He said he had to see Mooney
to sign payroll or something.

-Really?
-Yeah. Why?

Uh... nothing.

I saw you two were friends on Facebook.

Yeah, I'm also friends with John Oliver
and Ali Farka TourÄÂ©

and Blythe's great-aunt Siobhan
on Facebook.

Doesn't mean I really know them.

But you knew her, right?

Come on. It's just, for whatever reason,

Joe doesn't seem to want
to talk about her.

Yeah, I'd maybe respect his wishes
on this one.

Why? What happened?

He says it was nothing,

but clearly that's not true,
or you wouldn't be this way.

It wasn't nothing.
He was really messed up when it ended.

And he even disappeared for, like, a week.

-Where did he go?
-I don't know. Where do sad guys go?

But when he got back, it was same sweats
at work for, like, eight days straight.

Shit got dark.

But then he met you,
and you brought back the light.

Serious.

You make Joe happier
than I've ever seen him.

And that's what matters, right?

Just let it go.

Dr. Nicky was right, Beck.

I don't like looking back.
I don't see the point of it.

But if my choices are

stare straight at Candace,
at what happened to us,

or end up like lonely Dr. Desperate,
well...

Oh! Hey, Santa. Whatcha got there?

Well, that depends.

Have you been
naughty or nice, little girl?

Ho-ho-ho.

I'm sorry, I gotta stop that.
I... That's too gross.

I want to pepper-spray myself.

-Here.
-I thought we said no gifts.

Did we? I must've missed that.

Bunny.

My favorite.

- It's a first edition.
- Are you shitting me? Really?

- Mmm-hmm.
- I'll cherish it forever.

This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever given me.

Thank you.

"Be with me always, take any form,
drive me mad.

Only do not leave me in this abyss,
where I cannot find you.

Oh, God, it is unutterable."

I thought we said no phones.

I'm sorry, Bunny. It's just my brother.

Who's Elijah?

-Give me my phone, Joe.
-He's not your brother. I know that.

Give me my phone back.

Is Elijah going to be there?

Don't start this again.
It's just business, Joe.

Yeah, for you it is.
But guys like this are predatory.

-I don't think you should go alone.
-You're not coming with me.

Why? So he can at least think
that he can get you into bed?

Exactly.

Yeah, I am outside.

Where are you?

Oh, I see you.

Mooney always told me

a book is far greater
than most hands it passes through.

Some simply aren't worthy.

That's why it's up to people like us.
People who believe in second chances.

Maddie Johnson.
I'm Candace's friend.

So, I heard about you and Candace.

Yeah. Yeah, we broke up.

I mean, seriously,
I heard some kind of crazy stuff...

The Peach I knew?

No way. Why it's great
you're writing the article.

And kudos to Jezebel for wanting
to spotlight the fact

that depression doesn't present
like people think.

- Yeah, I agree.
- Wait...

You were with Joe Goldberg
the night we met, right?

-Yes. I was, actually.
-Yeah.

I remember you.
God, I was wasted that night.

Didn't you guys have, like,
a mutual friend or something?

Did. Candace? She... Long story.

I think they dated.

Oh, they did.

But I can't say I was shocked
when it didn't work out.

What happened, exactly?

Uh, there were rumors she cheated on him
with the guy who signed her to her label.

Which, to be honest, sounds like Candace.

I thought they worked through it,
but then suddenly she was off to Italy.

Just gone.

You still in contact with her?

That's the weird thing.
She ghosted everyone she knew.

So, even her family? She just...

Well, she really only has her brother.

And he's got theories of his own.
But Jimmy's not exactly well.

What kind of theories?

Crazy ones. Like, for starters,
he thinks Candace is dead.

Where are you?

There you are.

Excited to announce
I've officially signed with...

-Plumchapell Records.
-Plumchapell Records.

World ain't ready
for me and my new rep.

Ah, here we go. Elijah Thornton.

Yo, so I said, "Diddy,
you drop that bass line in the bridge,

and you got yourself a hit on your hands."

- I know what he's talking about.
- Yo, you know that track.

- Tell me it's not all about the bridge.
- It's all about the bridge. Cheers.

- I'll be right back.
- All right.

-Hey, Elijah?
-Mmm.

I'm Joe.

Look, man, um, just send your demo
to my assistant, okay?

And we'll call you.

Do you get all of your clients
to sleep with you?

Or did my girlfriend
just seem like easy prey?

-I'm sorry. Who's your girlfriend?
-Candace Stone.

I saw you. In your car.

You've been texting her.
You've been harassing her nonstop.

I mean, is it fun for you?

Do you like
pushing girls around?

What are you talking about, man?

I'm sorry, okay? I had no idea.
I thought she was single.

Honest to God, man, I...
She never even mentioned you.

Okay? I'm glad you brought it up.

Look, man.

She's been on me from the second we met.

I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but,
you know, you gotta know who you're with.

She's the type, you just give her a look
and then just... spread wide open.

Tell you...

Bitches are gonna be bitches, right?

What the hell are you gonna do?

Ah.

Oh, shit...

Hey, man, did you, uh... Would you want?
Do you want a bump?

- Yeah, yeah.
- Whoa, bro!

- My favorite.
- It's a first edition.

- Are you shitting me? Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

I'll cherish it forever.

This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever given me.

Thank you.

Goodbye, Candace.

Me and Jimmy.
The first man in my life. Hashtag, twins.

Hartley Psychiatric Center.
How can I help you?

Hi, uh, can I speak to Jimmy Stone?
Is he still a patient there?

I'm sorry, we can't release
that information.

Actually, I'm family. I'm his sister.

I've been away, abroad.
My name is Candace.

I should be his emergency contact.

One moment, please.

Ms. Stone, my name is Janice Ahn.

We tried contacting you.

Very sorry to tell you this,

but your brother passed away
six months ago.

Hey, Beck? Are you here?

Hey. I tried calling you earlier.

-What's up? Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

I need you to tell me
what happened with Candace.

What?

Okay. You heard me, right?
Well, I... I don't know.

I don't know why I'm having these dreams.

I don't care about the dreams, Joe.
I want to know what happened.

I want to know where she is.

Why? What does that even matter?

Because I am going crazy over here.

Because there's no evidence
that she was in Italy at all.

Evidence? What does that...
What do you mean?

Are you looking into her?

No one's heard a single word from her
since she left.

I mean, she went completely AWOL--

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
-...on social media.

Who moves to Italy
and doesn't post any pictures?

What are you talking about, "no one"?
Who are you talking to?

-Maddie.
-Maddie. Maddie Johnson? Why?

Because you won't tell me anything.
Why do you think?

She told me that Candace cheated on you.

Yeah, she did. A lot.

And the guy she was screwing,
he fell off a building.

And then Candace disappeared,

and then you supposedly went to Italy
to chase her, but if...

If she wasn't there, then...

And her brother...
Apparently, he thinks that--

He thinks Candace is dead.

And that I had something to do with it.

Do you know Jimmy was convinced
that I was a Russian spy?

Or did you hear about the time he tried
to attack his mother with a knife?

Or the six times he tried
to commit suicide?

Having him committed was the single most
responsible thing Candace ever did.

He hated her for it, and he blamed me.

Look, I'm gonna show you something.

She changed her name when she left.

She always talked about
starting over like that.

Never thought she'd do it, but...

Beck, she cheated on me.

She broke my heart.

Oh, my God.

What is wrong with me?

I'm so sorry, Joe.

'Cause my mind,
it goes to the darkest places sometimes.

If you believe that I'm capable
of something like that--

No, that's the thing. I don't.

I know in my heart that is not you.

That could never be you.

I did lie, though.

I didn't follow Candace to Italy.

If you wanna know where I went,
I can show you.

You ready?

Joseph. What's wrong?

Were you seen? Did you talk to anyone?
Did anyone know you were there?

All right, your clothes. Take 'em off.
Give them to me!

Okay, okay.

I killed him.

Listen to me, boy.
So long as you tell no one, you are fine.

Men, they go off to war,
kill people every day,

then come back
and get on with their lives.

Hear me? His life is over. Not yours.

Now, Joseph...

Some people deserve to die.

I'm sure you had your reasons.

Ah, Joe. Perfect timing.

Just finishing up supper.

- Bridey, this is Beck.
- Hi.

Nice to meet you, dear.

Hey, old man. This is Beck.

Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mooney.

I'm Guinevere, but people call me Beck.

Oh, here.

It was a stroke. Little over a year ago.

I still make it up at least, what,
once a week to visit you?

It never gets any easier,
seeing him like this.

He was such a force.

You still are, of course.
Now, I can get a word in.

-Oh, sorry, Bridey.
-No worries.

He, uh, took me in
when I was just about Paco's age.

Taught me everything I know.
He's really my only family.

And it's my fault he's like this.

-What?
-When everything went down with Candace...

I was just...
I was trying to win her back.

Or I was too busy
feeling sorry for myself.

I hadn't been able to visit in a while.

When I found him,
he'd been lying there for two days.

-Joe...
-That week...

I was here... with him.

Sometimes you can't talk about something
because you feel shitty about it.

This wasn't your fault.

And you're not alone anymore, Joe.

You didn't let go of my hand
the entire way home.

It feels good.

Who knew sharing my darkest secrets
would make me feel so light?

- Emma?
- What?

From, uh... Emma from Brown? The fox?

Oh, yeah. Um...

She's thinking about moving to New York
and has a million questions.

-You should... You should answer.
-No. It's okay. I'll call her tomorrow.

It was a solid excuse at the time.

But I've scoured your social media

and you don't have a friend Emma
from Brown.

Sorry, Bunny. It's just my brother.

But you're not Candace. You're not.

Ah, shit.
The alarm is going off at the store.

I gotta go.

Don't worry. I won't go in if there's been
a sign of forced entry.

Well, I could come with you
and be your backup.

I was an orange belt once.

That's all right.

You go on in.
You save those judo moves for later.

I better get in there
and shave my legs.

I've made a lot of mistakes, Beck.

Trusting my parents would come back
for me some day was a mistake.

Loving Candace. Forgetting Mooney.
Trying to help Claudia. All mistakes.

But what all of that has taught me?

Everything goes to shit
when I don't follow my instincts.

Get up on the fence. Don't move!

-Hey, come on. Be cool.
-Shut up!

Unlock it.

Ow! Ahh!

There we go.

Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.

Just take whatever you want.

You were... for months.
He tasted you.

He was inside you. In the bed I built.

He's been defiling you.
Taking advantage of you.

-On your knees. Now!
-Oh, God...

I have a family. I can make it right.

Please! I have a family, man.
They don't deserve this.

Some people deserve to die.

I know in my heart that is not you.

That could never be you.

He'll get what's coming to him.

This, Beck, is between me and you.

Hey, you. About time.

What happened?

You told me I was crazy.

What?

You told me I was crazy
for even thinking it.

If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

You said that to me. Do you remember?

-What are you talking about?
-You know what I'm talking about.

There's no Emma Fox.

I'm only gonna ask you this once.

And I need the truth.

Are you, or were you ever,
fucking your therapist?

Answer me.

Answer me!

Yes.

You don't love me.
You never loved me.

Yes, I was. I did. I... I cheated.

But it's over now.

It was a lie. It was all a lie.

I've done nothing but dote on you.

-Support you.
-I know.

-Love you.
-I know, Joe.

And look at what you've done to me.

What I did.

You dig into my past. You dissect my life.

You paint me out
to be this monster, this...

Someone who could hurt people,
who could do terrible things.

But who is the monster here, really? Who?

Why?

Joe...

I've never...

I've never loved anyone
the way that I love you.

And...

I didn't know
what to do with that, because...

I didn't think that I could have it.

Or keep it.

Is that true?

If you love me, we have a chance.

Say it again.

I love you, Joe.

I love you, too.

No dreams.

It's the first time in weeks
there are no ghosts in our bed.

Because you love me, Beck.

Where are you going?

I'm just gonna get us some breakfast.
Do you have any requests?

Mmm...

-Waffles.
-Okay.

I love you, too, creeper.

Hey, stranger.

Hey, Beck. Joe's gone, right?

-You just missed him.
-Good.

I just wanted to give this back.

Still not talking to him?

Paco, I don't know
what went down between you guys,

but I know how much Joe cares about you.

I wish you'd give him another chance.

Just tell him sorry I had it so long.
I forgot it was still in the ceiling.

In the ceiling?

Yeah, above the toilet.

He said it was a good place
to hide things.

Oh, shit.

My phone!

-I must've dropped it in the subway.
-Oh.

What the hell?

Ugh.

Oh.

Yeah. Hey. I'm on my way, bro.

Ozma of Oz.
And who said anything about Joe?

No, no, no, no, no.

- Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Hey, I'm back.

Hey, Beck.

You in there?

Yeah! Um...

I'm just not feeling so great
all of a sudden.

Do you think it's something you ate?

I don't know. Good question.

Hmm.

Ahh! Shit.

Hey. Sorry.
I think it was the milk, actually.

I'm gonna go get some more.
Do you want anything?

-What happened?
-Oh. Nothing. It's just...

It's a paper cut that keeps opening up.

Here, let me see.

Beck, you're shaking.

I just... I get weird with blood.

Let me see... Ooh! Ooh!

-Can I get you a Band-Aid?
-No, no. It's fine. It's okay.

Beck, sit down. Sit down.
Let me take care of you.

Hey, Annika just texted.
She's totally freaking out.

Something about her psycho roommate.
I'm gonna go check on her, all right?

I'll call you later.

Move, Joe!

Don't forget this. It's yours.
Wait! Stop, stop!

Stop.

I love you, Candace.

I don't care about what happened
between you and Elijah.

And if you love me, we can get past this.

We can get past anything. And I...

I know you do. I can see it in your eyes--

-No, just let me go, Joe--
-Tell me you don't love me.

I don't! I don't love you. I never have.

You don't mean that. You don't...
You don't mean that. Stop it!

-You don't--
-You're crazy!

What are you gonna do about it, Joe?

Hmm?

Joe!

Joe!

Joe! Joe!

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You...

Everyone just calls me Beck.

And you're Joe...

Goldberg.

People find "the one." I believe that.

I was in love once. Candace.
She broke my heart, Beck.

I should've seen the signs.

But we never do.

Exhibit A. Claudia. Single parent.

You think she knew Ron was a shitbag
when she fell in love?

You're a freak.

So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

A guy needs to protect himself.

I had to be sure you're safe.

I just need to know who you really are.

- You're smart.
- Shit!

My phone!

I must've dropped it in the subway.

Except in the ways
you are really not.

Like not locking your phone.

And that means I'm still logged into you.

Maybe we could get a drink sometime?

Sure.

Hell, maybe I'm just a fool in love.
It just feels right.

I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve.

You have questionable taste in friends.

Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

You fall for the wrong men.

Get up on the fence.

Beck, were you ever
sleeping with your therapist?

Yes. I cheated.

But it's over now.

What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

I need you to tell me
what happened with Candace.

Why? What does that even matter?

Because there's no evidence
that she was in Italy at all.

No one's heard a single word from her
since she left.

I know you.

You won't stop asking questions
until I do something about this.

What the hell?

I'll call you later.

This, Beck, is between me and you.

Joe! Joe!

- Move!
- Mr. Mooney--

- Move!
- I was just organizing the shelf.

You think you knew my business
better than I do?

Get in! And you'll stay in
until you understand.

- Understand what?
- Who I am to you.

Joe!

Joe!

Joe!

I'm here.

Joe...

why...

am I in here?

That's good.

Because we're talking.
We're getting it out in the open.

-You hit me!
-I'm sorry.

Beck, I'm sorry.

I didn't want you to freak out.

Joe! I am locked in a glass cage!

Temporarily.

-How long?
-What?

How long are you gonna keep me in here?
If this is just temporary.

Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead. I...

I need to know that I can trust you.

To see the truth.

What truth is that?

Everything I have done,
I have done for you.

Even this?

Even this.

Oh, God.

I wish I knew what you were thinking.

Tell me.

What's in the box? Tell me.

Tell me I'm crazy.

Tell me you didn't kill Benji.

Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

If you knew what I knew.

Shit, Beck, that's right.
You have no idea.

I promised you the truth
and I'm gonna give you that.

Wait, Joe! Don't leave!

I'm not. We're gonna get through this.

Joe?

Joe! No, Joe! Joe! Joe!

That could've gone worse.

I knew you'd be scared.

That's why I tried to protect you
from the truth.

Now I need to protect us from the world...

...long enough to work this out.

So business as usual is the best cover.

As far as your friends are concerned,
you're going off the grid.

And it wouldn't be a true social media
detox without announcing it to the world.

I'll be back soon.
The basement is off-limits

until I finish open-heart surgery
on a first-edition Sylvia Plath.

Nice. What kinda condition she in?

Fragile. Very fragile.

Evidence. Evidence is all I need
to prove to you that I'm not some sicko.

I'm your protector. You'll see.

Let's skip the "nothing to see here,"
get straight to moving along.

No, this is my building.
That's my neighbor, Claudia.

- Your neighbor, huh?
- Yeah.

So then you know the piece of shit
who gave her a concussion?

-Yeah, his name is Ron.
-I know who he is.

That's him.
Why is he not in the back of your cruiser?

Victim insisted
it was an accident.

She has a kid. Paco. Where is he?

I didn't see any children in there.
Probably for the best.

Joe.
You can't leave me in here.

I'm... I'm not. I'm sorry.

It's pointless to try to explain anything
to you without evidence. So...

no more secrets. Ask me anything.

So we both knew Benji was a dick, right?
What you didn't know...

He was a murderer.
He killed an innocent kid.

He's playing dead.
He's playing dead. Oh, shit.

No remorse. I fully maintain
he was sociopathic and dangerous.

Dangerous for you.
And Peach, she was obsessed.

She was hoarding these. For years.

She needed to own you,
to trap you, to make you her pet.

And what happened once she was gone?

You blossomed. You were published.

I get why you'd be freaked.
They're all stuffed in like this.

But they're just mementos, you know?
Like holding onto an old photograph.

Or you wearing my shirt to sleep.

You can't tell me that's so crazy.
It's the stuff of a million love songs.

I know this is a lot. Honestly,
I'm terrified sharing this with you.

But if we're being honest,

your life has been better
since you met me.

You just didn't know how or why until now.

Beck, I love you.

And loving someone means
you will do anything for them.

Benji's.

I had to burn his body.

And Peach?

She tried to kill me.
That was straight-up self-defense.

- It was self-defense--
- Oh, God!

No, please don't.

- Please!
- No, no, no, calm down. Please.

- Please don't hurt me!
- Please calm down.

No, you don't understand.
Please calm down. Beck--

- You killed them!
- Beck! Beck! Beck!

-You're a murderer! You freak!
-No, that's not true.

- Get away from me!
- No, you--

- Please don't hurt me.
- You don't understand.

I would never hurt someone I love.

Tell that to Candace, you sick fuck!

You're not listening.

Help!

Help!

Help!

Help me, please! Please!

Good morning.

- Get away!
- Jesus! It's okay.

What were you trying to do to me?

I was just making it cozy. Look.

You were sleeping so deep.
I didn't want to disturb you.

Well...

consider me disturbed.

Here, I brought you breakfast.

Somehow, being inches
from a bucket of my own pee has...

killed my appetite.

Oh, well, I emptied the bucket.

In case you ever doubt
what I'm willing to do for love.

And you're not gonna want to pass up
avocado toast from Dudley's.

And coffee how you like it.

I always wondered what that was for.

Oh, yeah.

Mooney claims he built it
for secure cash transactions.

I never saw anybody down here but me.

I spent a lot of time in here
when I was younger.

I was always getting into trouble.
Mooney...

He...

He was my Mr. Miyagi.

If Miyagi was a Soviet prison guard.

Who am I to you?

-You're an asshole.
-Yes. But who else do you have?

Your father,
who used your armpit for an ashtray?

Your mother,
who never did anything to stop him?

Or maybe you miss that insect-ridden
group home that drove you to my doorstep.

You don't care about me.

This place could be your salvation.

Here, you're safe...

surrounded by
the greatest works of humanity.

With no choice but to absorb...

...the wisdom of better men.

Beck, in the end,
the cage was a good thing for me.

I'm hoping it'll be the same for you.
Look, hence, typewriter, paper.

No distractions.

It's the low-tech writer's retreat
you always wanted.

I feel bad for you, Joe.

Was that pity? Disgust? Empathy?

Beck, I am really
putting myself out there.

The least you could do
is acknowledge that.

Hey! Not today, little man.
Hey! Look at me.

Are you out of your mind?
What do you think you're doing?

Get your hands off him.

I caught this punk trying to steal
the gun from the register!

Okay, all right. It's not loaded.

Oh, it's loaded.

I'll handle it.

Sit. This is not a toy.

- I know. I'm not dumb.
- I think you are.

I think only an idiot tries
what you just pulled.

I know why you want a gun, Paco.

Even if you don't kill yourself
with this thing first,

the second you use it on Ron,
your life is over.

That is the definition of dumb.

I'm sorry.

I know that was harsh.

It's a key to my place.
You can go there. It's safe.

Cool down. Crash as long as you need to.
And we'll talk about this later.

I'm not thinking straight
and it's your fault.

Beck, I can only buy us so much time.

And my patience is wearing thin.

Joe, where have you been?

-Hey.
-Hey.

Let's skip the small talk.
I just want to know if Beck is okay.

-Wait, what do you mean "okay"?
-We had a fight. I haven't heard from her.

Oh, I think it's okay to tell you
she's on a writing retreat.

Yeah.

It's all good, relax.
She's not texting us either.

-Okay.
-I just wanna know she's safe.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

What was the fight about?

Uh...

I caught her cheating.
With her therapist.

- No way.
- What?

-Oh, my God. No way.
-Dr. Nicky? Is she kidding?

-Beck!
-Whoa. Joe, I am so sorry.

- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
- So sorry.

- We had no idea.
- I thought we could work through it.

But then she ghosted me.

Wait. When she texted,
she said that her retreat was therapeutic.

-You don't think that she's still--
-I mean, yeah.

Wow.

Wow.

I really thought you two were endgame.

It just kinda shakes your faith,
you know? I don't know.

Do you really believe
that Beck and I are the real deal?

Joe, I've known Beck a long time,
and I have...

I've never seen her happier.

Or, like, more grounded or whatever.

I really think that you bring out
the best in her.

I think she brings out
the best in me, too.

Hey, maybe it's not so bad.

Maybe she's really
on a writing retreat, you know?

Or maybe she's just
trying to dodge that PI

'cause she doesn't feel like
talking about Peach.

PI? What do you mean?

Apparently a Salinger
would never commit suicide,

-according to the Salingers.
-It is so messed up.

They hired this guy.

He's been asking Lynn and I
all of these questions.

He even used the term "foul play."
Can you believe that?

Joe, we both know what you did.
Why are you surprised?

I'm not gonna finish these wontons.
You want 'em?

Okay.

Thank you.

I recommend the ponzu.
The sweet-and-sour is too sour.

Noted.

You haven't started writing.

I'm still waiting for that surge
of inspiration I was promised.

You seem like you're doing
a little better.

Maybe it's relative.

Yeah.

I caught Paco trying to steal a gun
from the register today.

What? Why?

Ron put Claudia in the hospital.

So Paco... I tried talking to him.
I think I just made him angrier.

Well, you got your girlfriend locked up
in a cage, a PI snooping around...

and you're worried
about your neighbor's kid.

I know. It's pretty dumb.

No.

It's sweet.

Joe,

I know...

there's a good heart in there, somewhere.

Joe?

Yeah?

I have to pee.

Oh, no, tell me you're not using

Henry Pelham's cartography
as a seat cover.

Sorry, I couldn't find any Dan Brown.

-Yeah. I'll get--
-Joe?

Can I...

Can I just please use the bathroom?

Please. This is dehumanizing.

You can trust me.

Thank you. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

- Joe?
- I can't.

I'm sorry.

Joe.

Joe, please.

- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

I am so stupid.

This whole time, I was wrong.

How did I not see this?

If you see this place as a prison,
that's all you're gonna be, a prisoner.

If you see it as an opportunity
for introspection and growth,

voilÃ , we have a future together.

You say you're a writer.
I fell in love with a writer.

Maybe you should be writing.

What now, Joe?
You're gonna go jerk off to my panties?

Or do you need to cut someone up
before you can get hard?

How the hell did you end up here?

Your life has been better
since you met me.

You just didn't know how or why.

You paint me out to be this monster.

Someone who could hurt people,
who could do terrible things.

"You used to wrap yourself
In fairy tales

Like a blanket

But it was the cold you loved

Sharp shivers as you uncovered
The corpses of Bluebeard's wives

Sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming

Slid one glass slipper
Over your little toes

A perfect fit

But by the schoolyard, real princesses
Floated by you on fall winds

You saw the gulf
Between you and the rich girls

And vowed to stop believing
In fairy tales

But the stories were in you
Deep as poison

If Prince Charming was real
If he could save you

You needed to be saved
From the unfairness of everything

When would he come?

The answer was a cruel shrug
In a hundred fleeting moments

The sneer on Stevie Smith's face
When he called you a fat cow

Uncle Jeff's hand squeezing your ass
In the Thanksgiving kitchen

The accusation in your father's eyes
When you told him what happened

From every boy masquerading as a man
That you let into your body, your heart

You learned you didn't have
Whatever magic turns a beast into a prince

You surrounded yourself
With the girls you'd always resented

Hoping to share their power
And you hated yourself

And that diminished you even more

And then, right when you thought
You might just disappear

He saw you

And you knew somewhere deep
It was too good to be true

But you let yourself be swept

Because he was the first
Strong enough to lift you

Now in his castle you understand

Prince Charming and Bluebeard
Are the same man

And you don't get a happy end
Unless you love both of him

Didn't you want this?

To be loved?
Didn't you want him to crown you?

Didn't you ask for it?
Didn't you ask for it?

Didn't you ask for it?

So say you can live like this

Say you love him
Say thank you

Say anything but the truth

What if you can't love him back?"

What if you're not the one?

No, now is not the time
to abandon principles.

I have to believe love conquers all,

and if you love me,
it's only a matter of time.

But time is not on our side.

I don't want to think worst-case.

I don't like having to scour your place

for evidence that'd link me
to your disappearance.

It's all starting to feel a little dirty.

'Cause I'm not doing it for you anymore.

I'm doing it for me.

And I'm not a selfish person.

You said you believe
I have a good heart, "somewhere."

I hope you don't mind
if I take a minute to look for it.

Claudia?

Joe. What are you doing here?

I'm looking for Paco. Is Ron around?

No. And I was hoping
that Paco went to find you.

I lost my cell phone when...

Nurses said they tried calling
the apartment but nobody answered.

So you have no idea where your son is?

Jesus, Claudia.

So damn easy to judge, huh?
Who the hell are you?

I'm the only one in this city
who cares about your son, apparently.

Why do you do this?

Why do you protect the man
who does this to you over your child?

Over and over? You're his mother.

Mothers are supposed to protect
their children from men like him.

I don't need a concerned neighbor
bursting in here

and blaming me for my own concussion.

Ron has connections. He's made threats.

You wanna know
why he's still in the picture?

I stand up to him, I lose my boy.

I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

Yeah, of course you didn't.

You have no idea
what it takes to live my life.

They don't write books
about women like me.

No one would think to.

Joe Goldberg?

Hello, PI.

Have we met?

Hi. I work for the family
of Peach Salinger.

-Just a couple quick questions.
-Okay, sure. Of course.

How well did you know Peach?

He's asking, but he knows already.

Not well. Through my ex, Guinevere Beck.

Well enough to be saddened by her passing.

You been to her house in Greenwich?

That's where she died, right? No, no.
I heard about it through Beck.

I know that Peach was having a hard time
when they were out there. Um...

Yeah. I think you should talk to Beck.

I've been trying to
get ahold of Beck, actually.

Yeah, well, we broke up...

so I'm not really in touch.

In fact, if you found me, that means
you probably found Lynn, Beck's friend.

She's the one to ask.

Beck, she might be out of town, writing.
She does that.

So, good luck. It was nice to meet you.

You spend a lot of time at her place
when she's out of town?

Shit.

Well, I...

He saw me.

I still have a key.
No, in fact, I had a key.

I returned it last night.

Should I be worried?
Are you following me?

Your ex ever tell you
that Peach had a stalker?

I mean, I know... I remember
the awful Central Park incident.

Peach was attacked, right?

But I wasn't aware it was anything
more than a random robbery.

The same individual may have been
in the house the weekend Peach died.

Seriously?

Found an item.
We're testing it for DNA now.

Wow.

That would be crazy.

I forgot the goddamn jar.

Well, if it's true,
I hope you find the guy.

I should've pissed myself.

Let me know if there's anything I can do.

Thanks, Joe. You mind calling
if you think of anything else?

Yeah.

And does urine even hold DNA?

Will do, Ross. Yeah.

One thing I learned
from my own time in a cage, Beck.

Never let yourself panic.

No matter how bad it is, you find a way
to stay calm and keep your wits.

I've been stupid to be mad.

I messed up,
and you're trying to help me do better.

I know it's hard to understand,

but sometimes we do difficult things
out of caring for someone.

I know the demons that drive you.

I have them, too.

It takes discipline...

to prevail.

That's why I work you so hard,
why I demand perfection.

My love for the books. Respect.

I'm trying to teach you a code to live by
so that you don't end up like your father.

And when I fail, you lock me in.

Exactly.

Because I love you.

I only hope it'll be enough.

Hey.

Hey, I'm sorry
that I went a little crazy before.

What's for dinner?

What's wrong? What happened?

You remember the PI?
He paid a visit.

You should've seen him.

I don't think he bought a word I said.

I'm not a killer.

I didn't plan this.

If I was some premeditated,
cold-blooded monster,

I wouldn't have missed anything that would
come back to bite me in the ass like this.

What did you miss?

It doesn't matter.

Unless it does, in which case you'll know
because I'll go to prison.

You might get exactly what you want.

I'll go down for something I did for you.

And you'd love that, right?
I mean, that's what you think of me.

No. That's not true.

You're not a monster, Joe.
I know I've said some stuff, but...

Come on, you can't expect me to be chill.
I mean, look at us.

For the record,

I don't hate you.

I am trying so hard to understand you.

Can you blame me
if I need a little help getting there?

What about Paco?

What about Paco?

If you go to jail,
the kid is screwed, right?

You think that's what I want?

You're the only person
who is there for him.

I think about what happens to people
who don't have anyone.

Joe, for Paco, okay?

Let's try and figure out a way
through this so that you can...

So that we can be there for him.

Claudia! Just open the door. I want to...

Just want to talk to you. Just...

Hey, let me in. Just wanna...

You little piece of shit!

Paco.

Paco, come here. I want to talk to you.

Paco, come here. Not gonna hurt you.

- Paco?
- Paco!

Get over here. I wanna talk to you.

Paco, come out here.

You're dead.

Hey, Ron.

- Joe!
- Paco!

Okay. This is what I need you to do
so no one finds out about this,

because people are not really
gonna believe us

about the way it happened, right?

Okay, there's blood in the hall.

You clean that up with soap and water,
and then hit those spots with bleach.

Really pour it on, all right?

Now, this next part
might sound a little weird,

but I think it might do the trick.

See this? It's Ron's phone.

I'm gonna be texting your mom from it.

Maybe Ron's boss, a few of his friends.

So they think he's still alive.

Exactly. So I'm gonna keep that going.

I'm gonna take it far away
from here, get rid of it.

All you have to do is say
you don't know where he is.

Shit.

Ron will never hurt or scare you
or your mom ever again.

And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

But it's over.

It's all over now, forever. Right?

He was a bad man.

Yeah.

He was.

Does that mean it was right to kill him?

Sometimes...

we do bad things for the people we love.

Doesn't mean it's right.
It means love is more important.

Hey, go home.

I believe that, Beck.
Love is more important.

But the world is a cruel place.

If I get caught for any of this,
I doubt a jury will see it the same way.

And you?

Will you?

There you are!

Read this, Joe.

A blind-verse rendition
of your love story with Dr. Nicky?

Keep reading.

What exactly is this?

It's the story of everything that happened

once I started having an affair
with my therapist.

I was broken and trusting
and I needed help.

And he, little did I know,
he was obsessive and very sick,

and would stop at nothing
to get closer to me.

And if you skip to the end,
there's this part

where I talk about a box of mementos
that I found on Nicky's property.

Evidence. A jar of teeth.

Joe, don't you see?
Nicky is your way out, Joe.

Our way out.

It's perfect.

I get it now.

- You get what?
- You.

You did everything... for me.

No one has ever loved me
the way that you love me.

I mean, you gave me everything.

Let me give this to you.

I mean it. I understand.

I was scared. I could've done something...

something really stupid
when I found that box.

But this...

This gave me time to think.

I hurt you. I scared you.

I understand if you hate me.

I love you, actually.

More than ever.

And I can wait until you're ready.
It's not so bad in here.

You take care of me.

And no one has ever
taken care of me before.

Not like you.

That's all I ever wanted to do.

And when you're ready,
we can take my story public,

and then you and I,
we can go somewhere and start our life...

And I haven't
thought beyond that.

But, Joe, I...

I know that I am better with you
than without you.

Beck.

If you were in here, this would be
our moment to kiss as, like,

the music swells and everything.

But I know...

I know you don't trust me enough yet.

I get it.

We're crazy.

Beck!

Wait, wait, wait, please.
Wait, I know you're angry. I know.

You have no idea what I am,
you fucking psychopath.

I knew it was too good to be true.

What, all the nice things I said to you
while I was locked in a cage?

You actually believe that all of this
is somehow justified.

It is.

You are insane.

You think that you did some bad shit
and that I did some bad shit

and that this is equivalent?

Yeah, I lied. I cheated.
But I didn't stalk you,

I didn't hit you. I didn't kill people.
I didn't do any of this!

There's not a line in the world
that I wouldn't cross for you.

I didn't ask you to swoop in for me.

But you did. Your life was a mess.

Yes, but it was my life.

And I didn't need some sociopath
on a white horse to clean house.

I mean, what gives you the right?
You thought that I would be grateful?

You...

you are him.

You are the bad thing.

You are the thing
that you should have killed.

If you let me out, we can just talk.

You know what I think?
I think that this was all just an excuse.

An excuse to justify
creeping into girls' lives

and violating the shit out of them.

I think you love it. The power.

-You love it!
-No.

- No, I don't.
- I think that this...

this was the perfect excuse
to take out people like Benji and Peach,

who've always looked down on you
and your whole miserable life.

-God, but you--
-No.

You are not special.

You're broken.

I could never love you.

Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.

Joe?

Help!

Help! Help!

Paco! Paco, thank God. I need your help.
Open this door right now.

Joe, he is downstairs. And he's crazy.

Joe?

Paco, he has killed people.
He's gonna kill me.

Open this door right now.

Paco, open the door!
Open the door, please!

Please! Paco, no! No, Paco!

No!

Keys. Keys.

When Mooney locked me in,
I learned a big lesson.

Hide a spare key so you can get out
of the goddamn cage.

- I didn't want it to be like this, Beck.
- I know.

I know. Just...

put me back in there.

These have been
selling like crazy.

Is it true she worked here?

Yeah, it's true. I knew her well.

I'm so sorry.
It's really tragic.

It's pretty weird when someone dies

and you literally can't get away
from them on the news.

Enjoy the book.
She was a really good writer.

You really were, Beck.

I miss you so much.

It's been a weird four months.
I had to do a lot for you, in the end.

âª I need my girl âª

âª I need my girl âª

You wrote the story.
All I did was bring it to life.

The story was perfect,
so everyone believed it.

There he is!

Doctor! Doctor!
What drove you to murder Guinevere Beck?

Yes, she was definitely
having an affair with her therapist.

That evil .

You know, our friend Peach Salinger
was trying to get Beck to stop seeing him.

So it's like,
did that psycho kill Peach, too?

I received the manuscript
in the mail.

It was odd, but far and away

the most moving prose I'd read
since Zadie's second-to-last.

It was also the most horrifying,

because I came to understand

that Beck was illuminating
her very own imminent murder.

That's when I knew.

I had to show it
to my literary agent right away.

It's true, maybe not everyone
was completely convinced.

Bullshit.

But you know what? Doesn't matter.
The evidence was overwhelming.

Thanks to your hard work...

and mine.

It was the last thing
we ever did together.

In the end, you couldn't love me.

I feel at peace with that now

because I loved you
the absolute best that I could.

And I gave you what you wanted.
I feel good about that.

I helped you become the writer
you so wanted to be.

Your lurid memoir of Dr. Nicky
was the lead,

but I cobbled that manuscript together

from every one of your pieces
fit to print.

The book is yours, Beck,
and it made you famous.

It's sad you're not here to see it.

But I know you would be so happy.

So, California.

That's great, you know?

You got the job. Paco's gonna love it.

Yeah, I think so. Weather's so good.

So, Ron.

Disappeared into thin air. I don't get it.

But, you know,
everyone knew he was a troubled guy.

He had gambling debts.
Who knows? It's for the best.

I know I haven't always been
the nicest about it,

but thanks for always being
so good to my son.

Yeah, it's nothing. Really.

I'll let you say goodbye.

Hey, Pac.

I'll miss you.

Me, too.

Hey, you know,
it's okay if things are hard sometimes.

You can still be a good person.

And have a really good life.
That's what I want for you.

This is good. A fresh start.

You're gonna put
the bad things behind you.

Yeah.

You, too.

I'm trying. I am.

But I'll admit, it's getting harder
to live with so much heartbreak.

And there are days
I just don't believe in love.

I tell myself to keep my heart open.

That in the end, I was wrong about you.

Every relationship
teaches us hard lessons, right?

That's their gift.

To make us ready for the day when someone,
maybe the one, walks in,

who could truly love us...

and we could truly love them.

Well...

hello there.

Who are you?

You've got that hoodie.
You don't like to be stared at.

But your legs are bare.
You like a little attention.

Okay, I'll bite.

Hey, Bunny.

-Candace, you're--
-Alive.

Yeah.

So, I think we have some
unfinished business to talk about.

.......... ********** ..........

Love,

this is why you're not for me.

Once upon a time, I believed in love.

Sure, I'd been hurt before,
but I'd learned from that,

and I wanted to fight for a fresh start.

The real thing this time.

So, boy meets girl,

boy knows this is a something special,
and he thinks,

"Let me do everything I can
to make this right."

So, I did.

I was brave.

I was vulnerable.

I won her the old-fashioned way.

I tried to do everything right

for her.

I knew you have to do anything for love.

So I did.

I did whatever I had to,

whatever it took.

I love you, Joe.

I love you too.

I heard about you and Candace.

You know, I thought we were pretty happy,

but she thought she could
be happier with...

some guy in Rome, so...

It's just how she left so suddenly...

But she did not trust me.

So she started asking questions
about the past.

Candace?

I think they dated.

Oh, they did.

But I can't say I was shocked
when it didn't work out.

Who's Elijah?

Give me my phone, Joe.

- He's not your brother, I know that.
- I don't love you.

I never have.

She started digging for stuff
that should have stayed buried.

I picked wrong.

I made mistakes.

Love had made me blind.

Joe!

And now...

Joe!

...love turned to poison.

Tell me I'm crazy.

Tell me you didn't...

kill Peach.

Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

And when love dies, it really hurts.

The bottom line is...

she couldn't love me back.

And our love died.

I thought that was the end.

A sad story.

A broken heart I'd have to heal from
to love again.

But no, there was more hurt in store.

Candace.

I think we have some unfinished business
to talk about.

Yeah.

And so I realize this is what I get

for trying so hard.

I can't love again.

I can't risk it. It's too dangerous.

The only fresh start is a start

without love.

Cut!

We're gonna go again from the top.
Quickly.

Nice.

Print that.
We're gonna go again from the top.

This...

is what it's come to.

âª I'm a troubled man âª

âª Changed by the things I do âª

âª True, but it's funny how âª

Love has taken me to dark places.

But Los Angeles...

has gotta be as dark as it gets.

When you're running from someone
who thinks they know you,

the best place to hide
is a city they think you hate

because, well, I do.

Hi, gorgeous people!

Just wanna say thank you. Wow.

Three million followers?

I'm honestly choked up
thinking about how much I love each...

I'm closing my heart,
like an out-of-business bookstore,

and I'm here for the moment
where everyone is too into themselves

to ever connect with another person.

It's the worst city in the world
and the last place I wanna be,

and that's perfect.

It's temporary.

Regroup, get some cash together,
figure out next moves, go.

Never look back.

It's a chance to get back
to who I really am:

a quiet guy...

...who just wants to lead a quiet life.

I've done time in uglier cages.

Welcome. I'm Delilah.

Will Bettelheim. Nice to meet you.

Your credit came back sparkling, Will.

Oh, good, good.

But I looked you up.
You're not on the socials.

Like, at all.

Thought you might be some kind of freak.

Just not great
at keeping up with that stuff.

Do you not keep up
with brushing your teeth?

I'm kidding,
I'm kidding. Okay.

I just have this vacancy
on the first floor.

- Do you wanna see it? It's bigger.
- I like the second floor.

It's quieter.

All right.

So rent's due on the third,

No loud music after ten.

Two pet limit.

And don't cook meth in your kitchen.

You got it.

You can keep the furniture if you want
or just let me know

and we can have someone take it out.

The last tenant
kind of left in a hurry, so...

hopefully it'll be better luck for you.

I'm in number one if you need anything.

That sounds great.

All right. See ya.

Home sweet prison.

It's uncomfortable, all of this.

But that's good, I'm detoxing.

Detox should be uncomfortable.

I've left so much behind.

And I know there's a side of me

that I let get out of control,

and now controlling is everything.

But, that said,

cold turkey leads to rebound,

leads to heartbreak,

if not crime scenes,

and posthumous best sellers.

Addiction management is key.

Ten minutes a day.

Do not fixate on any one person.

Do not get involved,
do not even look them up,

because I know I can get swept up.

But that's not happening.

This is a fresh start.

In my dreams...

Beck's alive.

She forgives me for everything I did.

She apologizes for everything she did.

And she says, "Don't worry,

Candace is gone.

Forever."

But then I wake up...

and remember.

I think we have
some unfinished business to talk about.

Okay.

Okay, let's go somewhere

and we can sit and talk.

As long as it's nice...

and public.

Are you gonna tell me what you want?

I'm craving French fries.

Candace...

- Hi. What can I get for you?
- Fries, please, a side of ranch.

Vanilla milkshake.

You want anything, bunny?

- No.
- Okay.

I'll be right back.

I want you to know I want it to stay gone.

I mean, you sure thought I was dead

or you wouldn't have
just left me there, right?

I was prepared to count my blessings
and never come back.

That's not how any of it happened.

So, anyways, there I am,

in a new town,

a new girl,

and I walk into this store,

and there's this book...

by a woman named Guinevere...

Beck.

You did it again, didn't you?

What do you want, Candace?

To kill you with my bare hands.

I'm kidding.

I could never.

I'm gonna go to the cops,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

Nope, sorry, not that either.

Too easy on you.

People.

People are predictable.

I cannot afford to be predictable.

My life depends on that.

But love, love is what kept me open,

alive, different, real.

And I also can't afford to do love,
so you see my dilemma.

Lady, how many photos does it take?
Come on.

Are you like, "Lady, come on.

How many photos does it take?"

Crazy thing is,
she never posts any of them.

That's, like, gotta be a diagnosis, right?

Precocious, unsupervised kid
who thinks she's not a kid.

Ms. Strauss secretly has six chihuahuas

so she walks them in shifts.

And you?

You are Will Bettelheim,

LA newbie.

Yeah, that's me.

Who is protecting her?

No, no, she is not my problem.

What's your Insta?

Or do you only have a Finsta?

- I'm a little behind the times.
- Clearly.

Anyway, I'm @Ellie-Eyeballs.

So...

you have a girlfriend yet?

Holy shit.

Ellie, how old are you? Like 14?

Fifteen.

Basically 16, so...

No, she's not my problem.

It was nice to meet you.

Cool.

Manners.

Thank you so much for stopping by.

I appreciate being the first call.

So Delilah, she's not a hooker.

It's what you're thinking, right?

Yeah, no, she's a reporter,

that guy's a publicist,

and he just paid some crazy kill fee to
not run something about someone famous.

- It's sick, she's a genius.
- Ellie?

No harassing the tenants.

I'm not. We're old friends.

Well, you're late for school, smart-ass.

Too young to be Ellie's mom.

Is that my shirt? That's my fucking shirt.

- How many times...?
- Sisters.

Can you please not wear that to school
and destroy it, please?

If Delilah counts
as parental supervision,

- it explains everything.
- It looks hotter on me, though.

Cool story. Any day now.

Note to self: steer clear
of their entire red flag galaxy.

Hey.

You lay a finger on her,

and I will vivisect
your individual scrotums.

She's a kid.

In Los Angeles,

grocery stores aren't just a place
you buy carrots,

they're a pristine, non-GMO Disneyland,

and king among these is Anavrin.

Come for the spring lettuce mix,

stay for the perfect life
that could be yours

if you spend enough
and quit gluten, you fucking asshole.

And yeah, obviously, Anavrin is...
wait for it...

"nirvana" spelled backwards.

So, no experience at all in sorting
or bagging perishables?

Well, I'm a quick study.

It's a coveted job.

Yeah, all the casting directors shop here.

- So...
- Oh, I'm not an actor.

Okay, let me xerox some photo ID

and I'll call you ASAP
and I'll let you know.

Sure thing, ID.

Damn.

- I know... I know I brought it. I just...
- Are you reading that?

Re-reading.

It feels like it gets
more relevant every day, right?

How... so?

Oh, this guy's struggle trying
to get past his mistakes, you know?

I don't like to get political,
but I will say

our world is done for
if we don't think about that.

How to be better.

- I can't believe you just did that.
- Did...?

Made a Russian novel
sound like something I'd want to read.

Uh, I don't mean to spring this on you...

Ever thought about working in a bookstore?

We've been having a time moving product.

You know, I thought
with this whole hacking democracy thing,

people would be like,
"Yeah, I wanna read some Russian stuff.

What's up with that place?" But...

they're intimidated, you know?

Hm, there's nothing to be intimidated by.

It's human experience. It's universal.

I think I just felt my soul
come back into my body.

I love it.

You sound like such a...

a reader.

Maybe it's 'cause
it's my favorite thing to do.

That...

and...

recommending the perfect book.

Can you start tomorrow?

- Yeah.
- Perfect. Let's get you an apron.

A new apron?

Joy.

Hello...

you.

No, fuck, no, I'm not doing that.

I'm not gonna try to figure out
who you are,

why you look so concerned

about the state of that heirloom tomato.

- Oh, did I get you? Are you okay?
- It's okay.

You have a way with people.

They just like you.

Your shirt is faded, but fresh.

You like to take care of things.

Your shoes are clean, but more.

You walk in a town where nobody walks.

I won't say hello.
I'll accidentally bump into you.

You'll never even know I was here.

Excuse me?

Do you think this peach looks like a butt?

There is no wrong answer.

It looks a little like a butt, yeah.

Right?

Hm. Thank you.

Are you flirting?

I'd like to think you are,
but it's just... I can't.

I should also inform you that...

all peaches look like butts.

I should walk away.

Oh, yes.

Well, thank you for your honesty.

I might go out on a limb
and suggest that...

bell peppers can be extremely vaginal
depending on how you cut them.

I hadn't noticed that,
but I definitely will now. Thank you.

Yeah, no problem.

Were you following me?

Shit.

Well, I mean...

Truth. That is what will
shut this down, truth.

Not initially, but then yes.

I was, completely.

I am sorry...

if I seem skeevy.

No.

I mean, you might've...

if you looked like a skeeve, which...

I guess is me saying, good choice...

showering today.

Good.

I debated, so...

Hm.

All right.

Oh!

You work here?

The apron.

Oh, yeah.

Will. I just started in the cafe.

Me too, um, I uh... I manage the kitchen.

I do most of the buying for the store.

I was just shopping for my dinner.

Anyway, sorry. Love.

It's my name, I mean.

- No.
- Cool. It's nice to meet you, Love.

No way.

Yeah.

I'll see you in the break room then, Will.

No, not biting.

I'm not that guy anymore,

and I don't think I ever will be again.

I can't be.

Love, you are not for me.

Mooney's Rare and Used,
this is not.

But hey, who needs Cervantes
when you've got chakra clearing?

Ralph Waldo Emerson? No.

Reading the Akashic records? Full shelf.

This is gonna be harder than I thought.

But this is the only safe place
for me right now.

No offense,
you look like you're ready to puke.

Just tell me what you want.

I'm getting to it.

Here you go.

Now you really look
like you're gonna puke.

Sorry, excuse me.

Mmm.

Shit.

At least when I'm here,
it's less about the people,

more about the books.

Excuse me.

Yeah, how can I help?

How can you help?

Yeah. Um...

Can you tell me
if this Carl Jung book is vegan?

Uh, if the... if the book is...

New here, huh?

Yeah, your apron is, like, very fresh.

Does everyone in LA walk around
like they own the place?

You got me. I just started this week.

The books are made from trees.

- I'm pretty sure those are vegan.
- I'm just messing with you, old sport.

Forty.

- Calvin.
- Hey.

Did you tell our new friend Will here

that it was Vegan Author Month
at the cafe?

I will get Will on the right page.

I know you will.

Will...

I think you are gonna do really well here.

I like your whole look.

It's very, um... I've-read-a-book.

Calvin...

So that's...

Forty's parents own the place, obviously.

Shit. He was being cool just now,

but if he comes back
and it's still wrong...

I got it. Don't worry, Calvin.

Watch the register.

Hi.

Let me guess. Hurricane Forty?

Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

Don't worry.

He almost never actually fires anyone.

You know how some people are,
like, starring in their own movie?

Well, his...

is about a hilarious misunderstood genius

working with idiots.

Right, one of those.

What? Do...

Do I have something?

No, I was just trying to figure out
what your movie is.

Oh, I think it might be the one where
the woman gets the guy in trouble at work

for slacking off.

I'm sorry, I got to go. Thank you, though.

I cannot let you in.

Are you running away from me?

What? No.

I feel like you are.

- I don't think...
- Don't think.

We have about six minutes,
which I think we can make that work.

You like that?

Now say, "I like that, Love."

I like that... Love.

It's just you...

and me.

What's wrong?

I don't do this.

Not anymore.

I don't fantasize

to some impossible version

of a woman I barely know.

It's not good.

No.

It's hard to have
a fresh start, Love,

when the past is on your mind.

Thank you.

Hang on one second.

Hello?

You don't think I have
your fucking number?

I'm not interested
in seeing you dead, Joe.

Truly.

Or turning you in because, best-case,
you go to prison forever.

- I'm hanging up.
- I wouldn't.

See, you'd go to prison as you.

You'd sit there for the rest of your life
thinking you're a good man.

I'm gonna show you who you really are.

And when you see it...

you'll beg me to turn you in.

It's gonna be really fun
fucking destroying you.

And I deserve that.

Candace, listen to me.

You're insane!

Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

I'll see you soon.

It doesn't take a genius to hunt someone

if you really, really want to.

You see, that's another thing
I learned from you.

Bye, Joe.

I'm getting paranoid.

There's no way she found me so soon.

There's no way.

I won't let Candace get in my head.

That's what crazy people do,
make you crazy.

Who asked you to film me?

No one.

It's just for fun.

Not a good liar.

I'm not mad.

Just give me the phone.

You asshole.

I was making a movie for school.

Ellie.

Shit.

Just a grown man

who put a hand on a teenaged girl.

All good, as long as I fix it.

Which I...

will do right after I fix another thing
I've gotta fix first.

Fuck, I'm starting to believe
in cosmic punishment, Love.

Not just punishment,

actual death.

If LA is hell,

surely the Hollywood DMV
is the Ninth Circle.

Hi, I need a driver's license.

- ID and proof of residence?
- Yep, it's all there.

Is everything okay?

Slow system.

That is completely unacceptable.

Ma'am,
come up to the window, please.

Just wait, I'll fix this.

I know that voice.

Sir?

This woman has an appointment.

Just like I just had an appointment.
You just helped me five seconds ago.

What are the chances?

She has to come back with somebody
that can speak whatever she speaks.

Arabic? I mean, it's pretty common.

Excuse me, does anybody speak Arabic?

- Anyone?
- I can.

Thank you, sir, please.

Come here. Nobody's gonna skip you, right?

Thank you, everyone.

See?

Someone who can help.
Wasn't that hard to ask.

Some people, huh?

Okay, this is all in order.

You'll step over there
to take the written test.

Okay, thank you.

Will. Kismet, right?

I mean, what are the chances?

I don't always...

cause a scene.

I promise.

That was pretty impressive.

Good, because I actually
frequently do cause a scene.

Well, I have to take this test.

Well, you got this. Here.

For luck.

Next in line, please step forward.

Are you really who you seem to be?

Could anyone be that light and fearless?

You know, I didn't
because I promised myself I wouldn't,

but now it would be weird not to, right?

You're kidding me.

Are you the only woman in Los Angeles

not showing off for strangers?

Speaks well of you,
but does make it trickier.

Unfortunately,
I know exactly what I need to do.

Ellie.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

It's a new phone.

Since it's my fault you...

It's a little upgrade.

You'll be making movies
on the thing, right?

Cost a chunk of my rent,

and the more money I need,
the longer I stay,

but one problem at a time.

I guess that's Ellie for "thank you."

I didn't mean to scare you.

You didn't.

Of course not.

I'm sorry, anyway.

I was trying to do
this whole vÃ©ritÃ© thing.

You know, like, you see Tangerine?

I thought you were, like...

hip.

Honestly, I'm more of a book guy.

Why are you robbing your eyeballs
of all things that are good?

Tell you what...

I'm making you a list.

Like, how do you even function
in a world without art?

Don't say you get it in books.
Books take too long.

I'll make you a deal.
You make me that list...

I'll make you a list.

Nothing long. I have a life.

Okay.

Oh, my God, this bitch's feed is so fake.

How do you know?

How... how do you know...

that it's, uh...

it's... it's fake?

Uh, I'm an American and I'm 15.

Why do you ask?

I thought you were too good
for the internets.

Actually, I'm thinking of joining.

I'm just a private person.

Well, so am I.

It's why my page is about my work,
not my dumb face.

See?

- Can I...?
- Yeah.

This is great.

Yeah, I know.

God, you really need a sensei,
don't you?

Are you offering to help?

What's in it for me?

I'll owe you one.

That'll work.

Okay, first thing to know
about being authentic and actually cool...

feeds that aren't lame
help people understand you.

But don't overshare, like, your breakfast.

Unless, I don't know,
is breakfast your brand?

I don't know that I have a brand.

It's not that deep.

Your brand could be, like...

you have good taste in whatever

your thing is.

So go places, look,

if it's interesting, take a pic.

Don't filter, don't hashtag.

Hashtags are thirsty.

That's literally the handbook
to being dope in a sea of basic losers.

Which... most people are.

Just lean into your thing, Will.

But in a not-try-hard

yet-you're-low-key-fascinating
kind of way.

That's how you get her
to fall in love with you.

- What?
- That's why you doing it, right?

- You like someone.
- No.

That's the only reason
anyone posts anything.

I don't like anyone.

Okay.

Uh, the other reason to post is revenge.

You have a nemesis?

I don't have a nemesis.

Don't take this the wrong way, Will.

Please be not this boring
on your Instagram, okay?

I will try my best.

My secretary will bill you.

Thank you.

It's come to this:

get online to blend in,
just long enough to get out

before Candace finds me.

Create a feed of my alleged life
while life happens around me,

but how would I know?

Not that there's much to see.

Friend requested.

Okay.

This sun is nice.

Any place is probably beautiful

when you stop running for one second.

I just want to stop running, Love.

I want a home.

Mom?

Mommy?

- Mommy?
- Joe!

Baby.

Right here.

I was afraid you left.

I went to get sunscreen.

Come here.

It's nice here, right?

We should come here every summer.

It could be our home away from home.

You are home.

Sure, we're home.

No, I mean, my home is you.

Me too, Joey.

Me too, you.

Hey.

Go get some ice cream.

Then meet me back at our favorite spot.

You know, the one from yesterday.
Remember?

And build me a sandcastle.

Okay?

Mommy will be back in just a few shakes.

Okay?

I'm an idiot.

Did I sunburn through this t-shirt?

How is that a thing?

Worth it, all worth it, Love.

Married.

Married?

Hey, Brooklyn!

I know you're in there.

Oh, the happily-wed missus.

I'm sick.

You're a rookie with a sunburn
is what you are.

Calvin told me at the store.

Let me in.

I can help.

Do you have a medical license?

I'm serious, though.

You didn't need to come
all the way over here.

It's no problem.

I live right in the neighborhood.

All right.

Is that salad dressing?

No, it's apple cider vinegar.

May I?

- You want me to...?
- Yes.

Trust me, in five minutes
you're going to love me for this.

Smells great.

Shut up.

Are you okay? This must hurt.

It doesn't.

You felt that too.

But you're married, so you're safe.

It's actually perfect.

Keep it light,

breezy.

There. We'll give that a minute.

Okay, now I need to ask you a question

that's deadly serious and deeply personal.

Okay.

Is that 99-cent ramen?

- Yeah.
- No.

- Yeah.
- No, Will, no.

You're an Angeleno now.

I'm not, actually.

You know, you ex-New Yorkers
are the worst.

I mean, haven't... haven't you ever...
fallen in love

reading Joan Didion

or Raymond Chandler,

or Francesca Lia Block?

You know, these...

- You've never read Joan fucking Didion.
- A little.

- She's next.
- No, you, you're missing out, okay?

This city, is...

it's... it's...

a million cities, it's...

I mean...

We're going. We're going!

Where, exactly?

As many places as we need to
to convert you.

Come on.

Let's go!

- Okay.
- Come on, snob!

All right, hang on a minute.

Need to get my jacket.

Okay.

Just gotta lock up.

It's my favorite place in the city.

I have this theory.

It's not my theory, it's the late,
great food writer Jonathan Gold's,

whose life mission was to know
Los Angeles the best way:

through food.

And, uh, he said,

"There exists for each of us
a perfect taco."

Point is...

Is it good?

...we are gonna find you
your perfect bite.

- It's amazing.
- But is it perfect?

It's a taco.

We have more work to do. Come, let's go.

Wait, hang on, this?

- You're telling me...
- No, no, no. Come on, come on, please.

You are going to love it.
It's going to be so worth it.

Okay.

Thank you.

So you really didn't like it?

No! No, no, no.
I would bathe in that sauce.

Stop lying to me.

I'll figure you out.

This is science.

âª Victories âª

âª Look better when you've called it... âª

âª Misery's the moment when I lost you âª

âª It's pleasure in a costume âª

Oh, so close.

Inches away.

Okay.

Research complete.

Final destination.

Let's hit it!

Let me tell you a little bit
about yourself, Will Bettelheim.

You are not a snob.

You're just old-fashioned.

You like things that are real,

made right by people who care.

You like strong flavors.

Gimmicks don't seduce you.

What seduces you is the real thing.

Therefore...

Roast chicken.

In cooking school,

they used to tell us that you could
tell everything about a cook

based on their roast chicken,

so I became a bit obsessive.

And you are gonna benefit from that.

You went to cooking school?

Yeah.

That's a long story.

VoilÃ .

Okay.

Make sure you have some skin and carrot...

and some crispy potato...

and then I'll rub it around
in the reduction a little bit.

- May I eat it?
- Yes, you may eat it.

I get it now.

Well?

It's everything I like,
made exquisitely, but what's perfect...

is you made it for me.

Is that you're speechless?

Perfect bite?

Perfect.

It's perfect.

Yes!

I knew it.

You were tough...

but...

I am a champion.

Shit.

- I'm sorry. Did I say...
- No.

I have to tell you something, and...

I'm just gonna come out and say it.

The community garden that we walked by?

I got married there...

three years ago.

Um...

We met in school and we were young, but...

I just knew...

- I'm sorry if I sent the wrong signal...
- No, he's dead.

Yeah, conversation killer.

He got sick.

And they, um...

they tried to figure it out.

But... they did not.

- Love, I'm so sorry.
- No.

No, it's...

It is what it is.

It was almost two years ago now.

And, like, look...

my life's great.

And also, nobody really understands.

I mean, who our age gets married,
let alone widowed?

It's, like...

Victorian.

So, you know, people are nice, but...

they can't really fathom
what I'm going through.

Yeah, it's lonely.

I can imagine.

Yeah, I know.

Ever since it happened, I've been able
to see this thing in people...

who've been through it.

I see that every time I look in your eyes.

Yeah.

You've felt it.

Real love.

Real loss.

Yeah.

Yeah, well...

Did you fall in love?

LA?

Is it so terrible?

It's not terrible.

Good.

I, uh, I got you a, um...

a parting gift.

Yeah, I thought about getting you
something happy, but...

Of course.

- Joan Didion.
- Let's face it,

what you're more interested in
is something...

smart and complex.

A little... dark.

Right?

That's what makes you feel at home.

How do you know that?

Well, 'cause...

me too.

I wanted to think you don't know me.

You can't, but I'm not too proud
to say when I'm wrong.

And maybe I was wrong about you,

and maybe, even a bit, all of LA.

And all I can say is,
I hope I'm also wrong about me.

Maybe I don't need to shut down forever.

Maybe I don't need to run away so fast.

And if that could be...

with you...

Blow.

Ellie.

God, it's from The Big Lebowski.

It's going on your list.

It's two a.m. Does your sister...

Oh, shut up, Dad.

She's right inside.

I just have insomnia.

From the 14 Frappuccinos.

Okay, sorry. I just wanna make sure...

Okay, Mr. Rogers, good night.

Good night.

Oh, Will,

someone came by looking for you.

Old friend?

Jesse. No, Jasper.

He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back

and that he'll be by.

- Fuck.
- Thanks.

Honestly, he seemed a little creepy.

What can I say, friend?
I have creepy taste in friends.

Ew!

Who is Jasper?

Why is he looking for you...

Will?

How are we gonna take care
of this problem?

So here's the thing, Love.

Cut!

It wasn't easy for me to get here,

to buy myself a little time,

this slim chance at a new life.

And then...

I saw you.

And, you know, I really do believe
that things happen for a reason,

that all the hard stuff and the craziness,

and frankly, my own mistakes...

they maybe all led me here...

for a reason.

At least I hope...

that's true.

Because I'm working as hard as I can
to make a fresh start here.

- What the hell were you thinking, Calvin?
- Ray said to stock more fiction.

Yeah, he meant fiction
that people actually wanna read.

- Okay, I just figured that...
- What?

There's a human alive
who wants to read Crime and Punishment?

Look, dude, find a way to move these

or, uh... something's moving.

It's delicate,

the whole... thing.

I have this vacancy
on the first floor.

I like the second floor.

'Cause it's not just a new home.

It's a new me.

I live right in the neighborhood.

Kismet, right?

I mean, what are the chances?

And when something like that happens,

when it's right,

you start to feel everything aligning,
like fate saying yes.

But again, delicate.

Anyway, this is a bad time,
the worst time,

for a complication.

Maybe I should run right now, Love.

But now I don't want to.

I need to figure out a way
to see this through,

whatever it is...

with you.

You win, Love.

I'll stay.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

- So, Copper River next week then?
- Sounds good.

- Is that a promise?
- You bet.

All right, fingers crossed.
Tell Theresa I said hi.

Thanks. Will do, Love.

I'm an optimist.

And that, Love, is why I'm gonna say,

"I can't wait
to tell our story to our kids."

I know, it's hardly begun,

but it's how I've always been.

Even as a kid, one glance from a girl

and I was trying out
my last name with hers.

I don't think that's wrong.

I think love should come out of nowhere,
sweep you up completely.

But let's not conflate optimism
with certitude.

I've learned some hard lessons,

fools do rush in.

And I've been the fool more than once.

If I'm honest, I saw red flags

and explained them away.

I wanted love so badly,

which is why I have to see
with clear eyes now.

You know what?
I'm gonna wait for the kings.

- Okay.
- Which is, like, soon?

Find those flags
before we've gone too far.

What's her name?

- Cindy.
- Cindy?

And this isn't to say
I'm not optimistic, so...

our story, I suppose it begins a week ago.

âª All this time I was trying to find âª

âª Some drug to fill this hole âª

âª It was my mistake to trust in fate âª

âª To show me the way to go âª

I got here,

and within minutes, I knew...

I'm in a strange land.

Duck-lipped,

stoned, suspiciously happy lemmings
everywhere you look.

This guy, LA in a nutshell:

the Unabomber with a three-picture deal.

Welcome to a city
where people trying to disappear

aren't actually trying.

Can I get a selfie with you?

Yeah, sure.

Poor guy.

Must really hate all the attention.

- All right, have a good one.
- Hendy, can I get one?

And then there was me,

the one in four million
not wanting to be discovered.

All right.

Step one in my effort...

tacos

with a man with a means

to bring a new, unlocatable me
into existence,

at least according
to his carefully worded ad on Craigslist.

Ever think how basically everything now
is GMO frankenfood?

Like... like, what exactly

is all of this hacked corn
doing to our epigenetics, right?

Apparently, California's got its
own brand of conspiracy theorists.

Yes, take caution,
lest you have a less-clean liver.

...you can give pigs fresh air
so they don't even need antibiotics.

Just a thought.

- Cages are never the answer.
- Totally, never.

So,
what I need...

I got you.

Get out, no trace.

If I want to leave today, say...
say, to Mexico...

Great choice.

Food's cleaner, cheap,
you'll love living there.

But I can't stay forever.

I have unfinished business here.

But would not recommend a return trip.

Getting out to escape Candace
was imperative,

but so too was the option to return

and actually deal with her
when I was ready.

What I need is something
more comprehensive.

Okay.

Here's the deal.

Truly airtight, livable ID takes... years.

The Will you see before you,

I micro-tweezed
like a bonsai for a decade.

I'm employable.

Background check me,
good luck not dozing off.

Actual face online?

No, can't find it.

But google me and I feel real.

And that, my friend, is a labor of love

far too intensive to even put a price on.

Okay, I get it.

I appreciate you can even help me at all.

Uh, so do you have it with you or...?

Follow me.

I realized
that with my Candace issues,

buying what this guy had to offer
wasn't enough,

and I didn't have ten years
to methodically sculpt a new identity.

You got the benefit
of being a white dude.

No one ever suspects shit
when it's a white dude.

I realized I needed to be him.

Will seems okay
for a guy who's been in a box for a week.

Without Mr. Mooney's help

it took two full days
to put this thing together.

Stressful doing it
with Will watching me, tied up.

You should be so proud of yourself.

Three quarter-inch plexi's a beast.

Yet those edges are a thing of beauty.

...attention to detail...

I gotta think Mooney would be impressed.

I'm guessing it represents
more to you too.

Safe space, perhaps?

One you felt you needed
as a child for protection...

I know everyone in this town
likes to talk about their feelings,

so if you want a therapy session...

tell me about Jasper.

Look at you now.

Able to put yourself on the outside,

that must be so empowering...

Who... is Jasper?

Come on.

He said you have something of his.

He's looking for me.

- Cannot keep me in here, Joe.
- I told you, this is temporary.

Then what is the plan?

I'm... Look, I didn't...
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I didn't... I didn't think.

I acted.

It was an emergency.

- You can let me out.
- That's great, I would love to.

Let's just figure out a way
to do that safely for us both.

As soon as Jasper goes away.

See, you're not hearing me.

This cage isn't great.

I need light.

I need my meds.

This isn't gonna be good for you.

If you want me to consider your needs...
just tell me what this guy wants.

Jasper Krenn.

Met him on what a layperson might term
"the dark web," all right?

Not even a client.
I looked into the guy...

didn't like, turned down the gig.

So you've never even met?

No.

He doesn't know what I look like,

so he won't know that you're just
some random asshole

who hit me in the head with a brick
and stole my life,

if that's what you're asking.

Okay, okay.

Okay, hold... hold on, hold on. You...

You charge a fee...

in advance of meeting.

You didn't give him his money back.

That is probably correct.

You have to pay him back.

I'd love to help, but I spent it.

And my earning potential
is somewhat curtailed by being in a cage.

How much do you owe?

Three thousand dollars.

It's no problem.

It's just 2,700 more than I had

due to the lack of planning
that preceded my departure.

Teach a man to fish...

you feed him for a lifetime.

Teach him how to make a counterfeit book,

and maybe, just maybe...

he can cobble together
a little something worth...

Three grand.

Best I can do.

Three grand it is.

I'll admit, bar was low.

Mooney would have thrown the thing
back at me, had me do it 50 more times.

Fortunately, an LA bookseller
is practically an oxymoron.

At least now I'd be able
to send this Jasper fella on his way,

get back to our story:

you...

the person who may

just make paying a $3,000 toll

to stay in this urban Gomorrah

worth it.

If only you weren't such an early riser.

It's becoming clear,

the more I see of you,

the harder it is to see you clearly.

If I don't want to get hurt,

I have to keep a distance
till I've done my due diligence.

Hey!

You keep wandering off. Here.

Though that's hard
when you keep inviting me to things.

I just didn't want to get in your way.

Oh, that's impossible.

Wow!

Look at that opah.

- Is that Ecuadorian or local? Thank you.
- Local.

I know you're making
all of this up to impress me.

You don't have to try so hard.

If you told me that fish was an alien,
I would believe you.

No, that's why it's good
you took me up on this.

For a guy who works at Anavrin,

you sorely lack an understanding
of the pescatarian lifestyle.

I'm a pescatarian ignoramus.

Are you okay? You look a little...

Mmm.

No.

Too soon, too much, too good.

Yeah, I just wanted to stop
thinking about it and just do it.

Interested?

Hate the idea?

I'm sorry, what did you say?

Lunch today.

My friends.

I think we should
just rip the Band-Aid off.

They're very LA, but they're also great,

and... they're important to me.

So...

And now you want me to meet
your friends?

I really, really need
a clinical distance. No.

I'd love to.

Shit.

Earth to Spock.

Come in, Spock.

Where'd you go, old sport?

You had that look
like when Keanu sees the black cat.

"Oh. Glitch in the Matrix."

We kissed and I saw the ghost
of Guinevere Beck,

my Matrix is glitching.

Yeah.

Yeah, uh, no.

I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

You know what?

Let's see here.

How about we move the women's lit display?

Like, why are we separating them?

That's sexist.

Right?

And besides, I woke up
with a completely brilliant idea.

- What's the idea?
- Movies.

- On loop in... in the bookstore.
- Oh, no.

Movies that are... wait for it...

also books.

Kill it with fire.

It's a great idea.

- Dope movies like Pulp Fiction.
- Not based on a book.

- Whichever of the Star Wars...
- Again...

Fifty Shades, obviously.

One for three, marginally.

We are gonna sell so many books,
it is going to blow your fucking mind.

- Can't wait.
- So just come clean this up,

set up the screen,

and when it all looks so cute
you wanna fuck it,

holla at your boy.

Namaste.

I'm sorry,

did you think this was a real bookstore?

Bless your heart.

It's cute.

Hey, Bettelheim?

Jasper.

He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back.

This is Jasper?

He looks like a manager
at a comic book store.

Sorry, who you looking for?

Well, you, Mr., uh, Will B.

Girl at your apartment
said you worked here.

Did she mention that I left word for you?

I'm... I'm sorry. I'm Jasper.

Oh, right. Man, I have been
having trouble reaching you.

I'm sorry, my phone's been weird,
you know?

But here, your money.

Here.

- It should all be there.
- All 50 grand?

I'm sorry, 50?!

That's some of it,
I got to liquidate the rest.

Oh. Oh, it's okay.

But I'll need it today.
Is that still all right?

That's great.

Perfect.

Hey, one other thing, uh...

- Sure.
- Check this out.

- Wanna show you something.
- What?

What are you doing?

It's okay, it's okay. Squeeze hard.

Right at the knuckle, a little higher.

Good. Good, good, good, good good.

Now...

I'm gonna need you to...

just gotta hold that for me.

Great, and, uh...

drop her in there.

There you go.

Now, over at St. Henry's
they have a fantastic microsurgeon,

Dr. Daniel.

As long as you're there
in the next 10, 12 hours,

good chance it'll reattach.

Provided you have this. So...

give me a call
when you have the rest of the money.

Probably sooner
better than later, I'd think.

Good to finally meet you, Will.

This is bad.

Easily leave-town bad.

But this is your town, Love,
and I can't leave you.

It's 50 thousand, Will! It's not three!

Can we please talk about
the $47,000 discrepancy?

Can we talk about my hand?

Oh, no.

I told you everything.

I told you everything,
and now it's too late.

I admit, I thought
his whole "needing meds" thing

was a ploy.

Fuck Jasper.

He's just some asshole
Russian mafia-adjacent wanker.

Were you even followed?

How would you even know,
you amateur!

They've found me and it's over

and you exposed us and now they're...

Oh... okay.

Oh... Will?

Hey, buddy.

Do you have any money anywhere?
Think, Will, think.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Will, listen to me,
no one knows you're here.

No one can take care of you
if the guy you stole from murders me.

Am I making sense?

Rufus...

he owes me 50 large.

He's good, he just...

Text him the code word.

This is important.

When I was eight, I broke my arm,

and they put a pin in it
and it's been transmitting,

so don't you go to the hospital.

They will chip you like a dog,
you understand me?

Thank you so much for caring, Will.

I can and I will neutralize
that chip for you.

Okay.

What was that code word?

Apparently, Rufus is someone
who conveniently owes Will

50 large.

While this feels too easy,

right about now the universe
owes me a little easy.

Spoke too soon.

That's not gonna work.
I have a lunch with you.

12-2.

And I hate Rufus.

Damn it.

I have to cancel our lunch, Love.

For the record, I'm opening sobbing.

- Hey.
- Just calling to hear if you were crying.

- You sound fine.
- Crying on the inside.

I'm sorry.

You're direct. You do what you feel.
You just pick up the phone.

I'm just sorry I'm not gonna see you.

This is how you handle rejection.

You want me to not feel bad
about blowing you off.

What can I say? Forty's a dick.

He sent me on a run to Alhambra

to get a sample of the competition's
compostable picnicware.

Forty said that?

Well, my coven's gonna be, uh...

sad they don't get to meet you today.

Yikes. Please don't let them hex me.

I'm sorry, I wanted to be there.

Yeah, I know, me too.

Talk later, 'kay?

Wanted to be there so much I decided
I had to at least drop by, you know?

I don't have the time to join you,
but I can spare a few minutes.

Especially when I've learned
how friends say so much about a person.

Will can't make it.

- He's sorry he can't be here.
- No.

Like how influenced you are
by their opinion,

- how much they secretly run your life.
- I'm bummed.

I was so ready
to meet your new man-friend.

And by "meet,"
Gabe means "judge and deem unworthy."

I'm sorry,
who are you talking about?

Lucy Sprecher.

She met Love at a rally for LGBTQ rights.

Back then, Lucy was an unpaid intern.

Now she's a social savvy power agent
whose clients include all the Jennifers,

the Kates, and the EU's
top-selling Instagram poet.

- Okay, okay, okay!
- She is coming for me!

Just ignore Lucy, she hates everyone.

Please ignore Sunrise.
She overcompensates for my bitch face.

Yeah, I do, babe. You're welcome.

- I love it.
- Okay. Okay, have you...

Here we go.

Sunrise Darshan Cummings, Lucy's partner.

Ironically never met of sunset
she didn't like.

Stay-at-home mommy blogger,

and Earth guide
to their adorable toddler, Candle.

Sunrise cannot be this happy

unless blending functional mushrooms
in your almond latte

is the grail we have all been seeking.

They source it from this incredible
biodynamic flaxseed guy.

Whatever that meant.

Gabe Miranda.

Small business owner,

which in his case
means a pansexual acupuncturist.

"Student," air quotes, of psychedelics.

Mostly dates men, but does something
I'm not gonna try to pronounce,

that's essentially...

fingering women to orgasm
on a pile of yoga pillows

packaged as a spiritual practice.

And you and Gabe

go back the farthest.

Besties.

So, this Is the Love squad.

Teeth-achingly, hippy-dippy,

unaware of the glaring privilege,

driving their so-called conscious choices.

Do they secretly want to sleep with you?

Own you?

Steal you away?

To Paris?

- Oh, my God.
- Will and I kissed.

- You kissed?
- Yeah.

I love that.

I wish Will did,

'cause I'm pretty sure I scared him
and now he's avoiding me.

And this is it,
this is when I get annihilated.

Well, then maybe he's an idiot
who should go fuck himself.

Okay, or maybe he's shy.

Love can be a little forthright.

Compliment.

So maybe the idea of meeting
three more of us is genuinely scary.

You're soft.

- Am I too forthright?
- No.

- Real men love that shit.
- Right.

Let's focus on what
is actually important here.

Which is...?

That your heart maybe wants back
in the game.

Maybe it's time.

I just, um... like him.

Aww!

I know I don't talk about...

James much.

I just really thought, you know...

I met my soulmate,

and that's done, and...

so the rest of my life will be,
like, you know...

Oh, honey, I know.

No, no, I'm...

It's fine.

But no one excites me,

you know, no one makes me miss them...

like James.

But now I'll just be doing something...

- random and I'll miss Will.
- Aw!

I don't even know him.

- Am I being crazy?
- Oh, no.

No, I think that maybe...

maybe you're falling for him a tiny bit.

That's so terrifying.

Aw. That's why
we're here for you, beautiful.

Waitress,
bring us all the desserts!

- I want 'em all!
- No!

Sorry.

I take it all back.

I love your friends.

And I see you, Love,

I hear you, and...
I get it now.

Am I losing my mind?

Hell, I've arrived.

It's called the San Fernando Valley.

At the borders of which
anyone with an architect's degree

is apparently denied entry.

A party...

at noon...

on a Tuesday.

Well, I'm glad these people
found each other.

Look forward to never seeing them again.

It'd be great if I had
the faintest fucking clue

what this Rufus guy looks like.

Hey.

I'm sorry to bother you.

Would you happen to know
if there's a Rufus here?

Are you John Mayer?

No.

No, I'm Will. I'm looking...

There you are, bitch.

He's not John Mayer.

You're a manwhore, John Mayer.

I'm guessing they won't be any help.

Oh, my God, look over there.

Oh, my God. It's totally him.

Hold on.

That's airport guy.

What's he doing here?

What is it about this guy that makes
people act like they're in a customs line

with an ass full of heroin?

No, it's Hendy.

You gotta get a picture of him
with me in it.

Hendy?

Hendy.

Okay, Hendy.

Comedian.

AKA Henderson. FKA Josh Bunter.

Kicked cancer. Interesting.

Is ostentatiously zen about it.
Predictable.

Wait a second, this is Vacuum Guy?

Ethan loved this gag.

Oh!

Brexit!

Right?

Apparently,

Hendy's got a hard-life-lessons
man-of-the-people thing working for him.

Apartment three?

Oh, great.

Is this party gonna get any more weird?

- What happened to your hand?
- Uh... Oh, it's...

Oh, you're really not from here.
I asked, but I actually don't care.

I've been up for two days
chasing that whole Jared Padalecki thing,

but he's been laying low,
so I kind of detoured here

to find this hairstylist, Kido.

Word has it he can confirm...

Really couldn't care less about Kido
or why Delilah's here at all.

If anything, I've only got more reason
to get the hell out of here.

...Rufus who knows the owner of this house
who's a producer

- and he knows Kido...
- Wait, I'm sorry, did you say Rufus?

Yeah, my girl Tanika knows him.

The friend I'm looking for
has a buddy, Rufus.

Could you...
could you maybe point him out for me?

You're kidding me.

Delilah.

Hey, long time.

You look great.

I look like a walking red-eye
from Pittsburgh, but you look great.

- What are you doing here?
- Just working on a piece.

'Course you are.
Always the smartest girl in the room.

Yep. It's exhausting.

Yeah.

What, d'you go for
the president's curly fries?

Sorry, this is Will.

Hi. No, it was an accident at work.

It might need surgery, but it's, uh,
you know, it's okay.

Well, if you do, Dr. Daniel

at St. Henry's Medical Center.

Uh, if you go, tell him we're friends
and he'll hook you up.

Thank you. Thanks.
Really, I appreciate that.

- Yeah.
- Hendy!

Uh... excuse me, guys.
Great to see you, gorgeous.

Well!

He seems pretty great.

Drool a little more,
it's a good look on you.

Did he come up in one of your pieces?

Meaning is there shit on him? Scoop?

- Inquiring minds want to know?
- Never mind. If you don't want...

Let me just give you
the Idiot's Guide, okay?

Being famous...

don't make you magic.

Cover shit in gold,
it's just super shiny shit.

I had a feeling you might know that,

but I was wrong, and now I pity you.

- Excuse me.
- Hold on. You gonna point out Rufus?

You're a big boy. Figure it out.

- Hey.
- Yeah?

- Rufus would like his Negroni.
- All right.

Thank you.

Hi.

Excuse me.

Rufus?

Oh, you found me.

Yes.

Hey, lose the clothes if it's all right.

Hope you like Air Supply.

I'm kind of kind of
on a ballad jag right now.

You look different
than your picture on the app.

It's Todd, right?

Actually,
I'm here for "Battlestar."

- You're not Will.
- No.

He told me to use the code word.

I'm helping him out.

Here I'm about to blow you.

I got your shit in my bag.

There you go.

It's okay if I count it?

You shittin' me?

These are pills.

Same ones, man.

But faster acting.

I got a new source in Quebec.

What about the 50 grand?

The 50 grand?

Would you settle for that blowjob?

It turns out
Rufus has been supplying OG Will

with off-brand Canadian meds

for a rather severe bipolar disorder.

Explains so much.

Evidently,
Will kept just enough of a grip

to turn me into his TaskRabbit.

But hey, he needs them.

Nope, I won't take 'em. Flush 'em!

Keep your poison.

What do you mean?

I went to the Valley for you.

Farewell to that small part of Will
aspiring to sanity, I guess.

You'll feel better.

Yeah, then you take 'em, fucker,
'cause I don't believe you.

You should believe me!

Believe me when I tell you...

I could hand you to Jasper.

I wouldn't have your problems anymore.

Learned something today.

Screaming at crazy

can reopen a wound.

Love, this is trial by fire for you.

Hey, I really think
we need to talk.

Oh.

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, my God! What happened?

Oh, it's... it's nothing.

- Oh, no, what did you do?
- No, it's fine.

It's a cut, it's nothing.
What do you want to talk to me about?

You lied to me.

- What?
- Lunch.

Forty?

He's a bad alibi. He's been telling me
everything since we were born.

Shit.

- Is Forty your brother?
- My twin brother.

And you called him a dick,
which he can be,

but you were also lying.

You own Anavrin.

That's what I get for not trying
to find out everything about you first.

My parents own Anavrin.

I just work there.

I was trying not to instantly
complicate things

by waiting to tell you.

But you...
you complicated things by lying.

Why would you lie?

So I could walk through
fire for you.

So I could slay dragons to stay near you.

- I just... I don't know you.
- Yet.

- You don't know me.
- Yeah, well, apparently.

Because I thought that we were...

I mean, we kissed, Will.

This is... This is not a good time.

This is not good timing.

This is about your ex, isn't it?

- Yes.
- No.

She really hurt you.

I can smell your shampoo,

and nothing you're doing is making it
easier for me to see you clearly.

But guess what? My husband hurt me, too.

Among other things, by dying.

So, I understand why this is hard for you,

but it's also why I just say things now.

'Cause there was things
I was waiting to say to him.

And I... I don't know
if this is just a fling

or something more, but either way...

I think it's a mistake to do
the bullshit thing that you're doing.

- No, it's not bullshit...
- Yes, it is!

You don't need to run away.

Please, no.

- Stop.
- You can...

Please! Stop!

Just stop!

Okay.

You don't need to yell.

Ever.

I liked you.

This sucks.

You're bleeding again.

Why are you here?

You've actually lost
a lot of blood today, Joe.

Is that what you are?

My lost blood?

Really all-in on this one.

I guess that's you, right?

See a girl once.

I'm... I'm trying...

to do it right this time.

As opposed to with me.

What went wrong with me, Joe?

We both know what happened.

You can haunt me forever,

you will never get me to say
I didn't do everything I could for you...

- for us.
- Look at me, Joe.

- No, you are not...
- Look at me.

You are not here.
I am not arguing with you!

Hey, Jasper, yeah.

Yes, it's Will.

I am on my way.

Thank you for coming. Is that my...?

Perfectly preserved
and anxious to get back to Daddy.

Great. It's right in here.

Look...

I am not Will Bettelheim.

This is.

Well, this is a first for me.

My name is Joe Goldberg.

I just needed his name

and his life for a little while.

So you put him in
a Hannibal Lecter thing, I see that.

I assume you realize
that you need psychiatric help?

I'm not crazy, okay?

My ex-girlfriend's stalking me
and this is the best I could come up with.

But can I please have my finger?
'Cause this is Will.

He took your money. Take him.

Well, if you couldn't get it out of him...

Right?

I mean...

You sure, now?

- You ain't got it?
- Please don't.

You don't have to do this.
You don't have to...

You see, Joe?

No.

You don't understand.

But I do.

I'm trying to survive.
He wanted to hurt me.

Well, you hurt him.

And you hurt me.

I loved you.

- More than I've ever...
- Then you hurt me.

Look at me, Joe.

Sometimes...

we hurt the one we love.

Right?

You're not afraid Love will hurt you.

You're afraid you'll hurt her.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

No. Please stay.

Please.

Stay.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Hendy was right.

Dr. Daniel, one impressive microsurgeon.

Thank goodness for these pain pills.

They're gonna block out
more than one type of pain tonight.

Knocking out Anavrin's security cameras
will cover up another.

Sometimes I wonder
if I understand love at all.

The thing transforms us.

But into what?

Love turned me into something else
back then with Beck.

My hope now...

is that you can turn me
into something better.

Because of this is all I am,

I may as well turn myself into Candace.

âª All of your love
Give me your love, give me your love âª

âª Give me your blood
Give me your blood, give me your blood âª

âª It's all that I want... âª

âª Give me your blood
until I want no more... âª

âª Anything else of the world before... âª

âª Give me your blood
till I want no more âª

âª Give me your blood
until I can't remember âª

âª Anything else of the world before âª

Hey.

Wow, it smells amazing in here.

I did not just make you an entire meal.

I am angry and embarrassed

and I shouldn't have texted you back.

I just...

I was just also hungry, so I... you know...

I'm glad you kissed me.

It did not seem like it.

I was.

I was also freaked out,

not because you did it,
but because of how it felt.

I didn't expect...

you.

This.

I wasn't looking...

for this.

I want it, but I can't...

have it...

right now with you...

or... or anyone.

She really hurt you, huh?

Mm.

No.

No, I hurt her.

I really hurt her.

So you understand, I can't...

Did you wanna hurt her?

No.

Of course not.

So what I'm hearing is that two adults...

both knowing the risks...

I don't think she knew.

Okay, well, you know,
none of us know anything.

You know?
But you put on your big girl pants

and we give things a shot.

I have to believe that hurting her was
the last thing you wanted to do, right?

- That was a question.
- Yeah, that's right.

- Okay.
- Right.

How about I take care of me...

you take care of you...

I try not to hurt you,
you try not to hurt me.

You know, what else is there?

I'm just...

I'm... I'm afraid.

Yeah.

Relationships are scary.

You don't get all that goodness
and possibility with zero risk.

But, Will...

you cannot hurt me.

I want to believe that.

Okay.

Thank you.

I just...

- Just come here.
- Okay.

Look, to be honest,

I feel...

so shitty...

about the way it went with her.

So I can't...

I can't...

till she's...

really gone.

No, it's valid.

Yeah, no, I...

Okay, two things.

One...

friends.

Okay, friends can be good.

We can just call this a friendship.

That might help.

Okay, great.

Poof, friends.

And two...

I felt the same way about James.

And I don't want to sound corny,
but I did this thing,

where I took a bunch of his stuff
and I put in a box and I...

let it go in the ocean.

I'm not really one to hold on to things.

It's not... Um...

You could just, you know, write a note.

A goodbye.

Burn it.

Something.

And I would help you.

Friends support each other.

Whatever you call us...

it feels right.

Because we're an "us."

And if we are an "us,"

then, dare I say it...

this...

this is home for now.

And I should probably be a good neighbor.

Oh...

Try that guy.
These two are full and that one...

Eats the quarters, yeah.

You don't have to be all nice.

I feel bad, like I did something.

No, it's not you, you were just
in the line of fire when Henderson...

We go back.
We met, like, eight years ago

when I was dancing at this bar downtown.

Not just to do it, but because I was
actually pursuing something.

I wanted to be Carrie Fisher.
She's such a great writer.

But I was stuck in Covina
and my mom was such a cunt,

and one day, I was just like, "Fuck it.

Let me get a fake ID and get out of here

and go follow my dreams."

It's hard to imagine her
with dreams.

Henderson was cool.

He, like, gave me copies
of Syd Field, Save the Cat.

And he was like, "You're actually good,"

which nobody ever...

And I had heard, or whatever,

that he had young girls around,

but I just thought
I was talented and special.

One day, I was at his place,

and I had, like, three sips of beer,

and I got so fucked up.

Eight years ago? You were, like...

Seventeen.

Anyway, I remember being like,

"How is it ten p.m.?"

And I look down and...

my skirt was pulled up.

So you're saying Henderson...

Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.

Have you ever tried...?

To what? Tell anyone? No.

Who?

I tried to do a story years later,
but nobody would talk to me.

Guess why? They're all like I was.

Underage...

strippers...

not white...

The world would eat them alive.

And that's why I don't lose
a drop of sleep

on any of these motherfuckers
I write about.

They all deserve it.

My math says 49% of humanity
deserves to die in a fire.

Don't do that. You, like...

You nod as if you're somehow
not one of them.

Well, let me give you the gift of honesty.

You...

act nice because you're not.

And I may not know
what kind of bad you are...

but I got my radar the hard way.

So...

stay the fuck away from me
and my sister, okay?

Have a fantastic day.

Tell me I didn't eat those.

Do you know...

how much oxidative stress
those things put on your body?

I'm guessing a shower
is out of the question?

Did you say Jasper came around?

I paid the man.

And he went on his way.

If things were different,
I'd say I owe you 50 grand.

- Why? You got it laying around somewhere?
- Nice try.

It's spent.

- What were you thinking?
- Honestly...

a little while ago I fell in love.

And she needed help.

So I just did it.

You've been putting meds
in my drinks, huh?

That's green juice.

Thanks.

Well, my current reality is...

suboptimal, but even so,

upgrade from where I was.

At one point,
I thought I saw you murder a guy.

Crazy town.

Well, glad to have you back.

I guess it's goodbye, Beck.

I'm sorry.

I really am.

Goodbye, you.

How did that feel?

Like a good first step.

Still can't wait to tell our story
to our kids.

How we decided to walk before we ran.

Started out as friends.

The past...

is prologue.

I made mistakes, yes.

And I'll learn from them.

Prove...

I'm worthy...

of you.

Hey, should I open another bottle?

I know we'll get there.

I'm optimistic.

It's just...

who I am.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

Nora Ephron once wrote,

"Men and women can't be friends

because the sex part
always gets in the way."

But we're making it work, Love.

Keeping it simple.

We're friends.

Just friends.

Want you to know I wouldn't blame you.

It's a tough scenario
when they go full sorority ho on ya.

Oh, come on. She's...

our boss.

And it's for the best.

Can you imagine what I'd do to Calvin
if we were together?

Or worse, what I might do...

to you?

You leave me gifts every day.

I enjoy them as friendly offerings.

I can't let them mean
anything more because you...

Oh, that is phenomenal.

We still spend time together.

Between your busy work schedule
and volunteering at a soup kitchen...

you could use all the help you can get.

It's not that I don't want you.

We have a connection, something deep.

But the last time I loved someone...

Well, I can't risk repeating history.

So really, this is me protecting you
by being your friend.

You see? This is easy.

Platonic.

Safe.

Just friends.

I don't know, man.

From what you're telling me...

it would be easier
for you and this chick to...

smash.

Don't say "chick."

Lady friend?

You won't tell me her name, so...

You gonna guess or what?

T.

D.

S.

M.

Dude, slow down.

You'll be dead before you kiss the girl.

Hint, it's a place.

Madrid.

So is she pretty?

I'll be back at lunch.

Man, you could talk to me,
the least you could do is talk to me.

You're living under a false name
in a new city,

that's mega-lonely.

Maybe you could use a friend, too.

Like I said, I already have a friend.

I don't think you understand
how friendship works.

Man, I'm just kidding.

How about
a heritage grain bowl for lunch?

Oh, man.

That was great.

Okay.

Hi.

You can play. Just stay close.

- You want to play?
- There you go, go on the slide.

I promise we didn't drag you here just to
watch our child almost bash their face in.

Yeah.

We have news.

- We have a date.
- For the wedding?

- Yes.
- Oh, my God!

When? Where?

- October. It's a formality, obviously.
- It's more than an formality.

- It's gonna be modest.
- It's gonna be huge.

- We're on a budget.
- We're not.

I want to make your cake.

- No.
- No way, no.

That's too much work for you.

Your only job at this wedding
is to drink and dance.

- Yeah.
- Please? I mean, I'll be amazing. It...

Come on, it would mean so much to me. I...

Not to be corny, but...

baking is how I express my love.

- Don't do that.
- Come on, don't break my heart.

- Of course!
- Oh, fine!

Yes! Yeah-yeah-yeah!

Oh, my God, okay, I am so excited.
I have so many ideas.

And I have all this energy
that I don't know what to do with.

Oh, there it is.

What is where?

You cook when you're happy
and you only bake when you're frustrated.

Let me guess.
Will Bettelheim flaked on you again.

Does he even exist?

And if so, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's obviously not into you.

Yeah, well, that's impossible.

Okay, look, if you're determined
to ignore the red flags,

then, yeah, you've gotta
take your cues from him.

- Or a radical idea: Bumble.
- True.

No.

But the second
you start to feel desperate...

- Ripcord.
- Yeah.

We'll see.

I'm definitely walking the line between
desperate and, you know, shameless.

Will, hope you're not triggered
by the word "moist."

Oh, it's like eating pure sex.

How am I supposed to resist this?

If only the universe
would send me some sign,

some platonic way
to stay in your good graces.

William fucking Bettelheim.

Can I get a different sign?

Love's buns, am I right?

Well,
that's accidentally horrifying.

Your sister's very talented.

Whereas your twin brother
literally reeks of privilege.

Who shows up to work unshowered?

Who shows up anywhere in a kimono?

So, I couldn't help but notice,

you are crushing it.

Like, customers are talking about books.

This is about Love, clearly.

Does he not know I'm not a threat?

But if I might humbly

make one suggestion...

Here it comes, some clumsy version
of "stay away from my sister."

Journals.

You know, the muse strikes like lightning,

and the best ideas are always
the ones that slip away.

You're a writer.

Director-producer, but writer first.

I almost forgot, this is LA.
He's not interested in me,

he needs me to be interested in him.

You know, managing the store
just kinda helps me recharge.

I've got five features in development,

two properties I'm chasing.

Love, I'm not stupid.

This mix of humblebrag and gibberish

is your douchebag brother's attempt
to keep his enemy close.

Annapurna actually is set to produce,

and my dear friend, Daniel Day-Lewis,

is attached to this dope pitch
I've been kicking around.

And last I checked,
family automatically trumps friends

in the social hierarchy.

I need to win this guy over.

But DDL's oeuvre is not about that
four-quadrant hero's journey bullshit.

So I'm, like, birthing the scenes

instead of impaling myself
on the rocks of a three-act structure.

"A good story cannot be devised,

it has to be distilled."

That's Raymond Chandler.

Exactly.

Sport.

Come with me to Harold Night after work.

I'm talent scouting.

An improv show?

I'd rather watch a cat massacre.

That sounds dope.

Incoming... non-ironic brah request

for one William Bettelheim.

Gotta go. Gotta write my morning pages.

Maybe this is good, Love.

A benign thing
that'll deepen our friendship.

Now we share a brah.

He's a social creature.

Never alone, therefore never working.

There you are, cute, innocent...

Where did he go wrong?

Forty wrote and directed
a short film called The Third Twin...

...au pair one summer.

Uh, and so Love and I were making
our own breakfast.

...that may have won a Grand Jury
prize at Sundance,

and he hasn't done a thing since.

His inspiration evaporated
in a haze of Hollywood parties

and VIP events.

Then at a certain point,
those evaporated too.

Your brother is a sycophantic
fame-grubbing Hollywood has-been,

so of course our first friend date

is in a sea of sweaty,

thirsty Hollywood outsiders.

You can't play that cello in here.

This is daycare.

Wait, did someone move the symphony?

Young, hungry, and broke,

masquerading as
actors-slash-writers-slash-directors

to take the pain out of being
nannies-slash-baristas

slash-disappointments.

This room is a self-fellating
ouroboros of desperation.

He isn't even watching.
What are we doing here?

You're crazy.

All right, thank you!

We are Trigger Warning!

But stay in your seats.

We've got a special treat for you.

It's a secret set

from someone you may know.

I knew it.

Henderson!

A-ha! That's who we're here for.

Hendy and I go, like, way back.
I'm... I'm writing this role for him.

- My skirt was pulled up.
- So you're saying Henderson...

All right,
how many of you guys

have seen the movie
and love the movie Love Actually?

All right, get the fuck out.

I'm serious,
I don't want you laughing at my shit

because then I'll be
second-guessing my taste.

All right? All right, strap in

and get ready for a 15 year old
cultural staple

that's more cancerous
than my actual cancer.

Um... So just, like, five minutes,

I promise, just long enough
for me to reconnect with Hendy.

Okay, hang on a second.

From what you know, is he...

Is he a good guy?

Oh, yeah, he's like, the best.

I mean,
he used to be kind of a party monster.

Um, then the cancer, like,
really set him on, like, a higher path.

Just... Okay.

Jonah, man, long time no see, dude.

Um, I just have
some business with Henderson.

No, no. You've got some balls, Quinn.

Come on, man. Like, you're a manager now.

You're not a bouncer.

I'm... I'm sober now.

Then take Henderson
off your amends tour.

Okay, well, I'm sure
if you just let me speak to him...

What, you're gonna let her through?
What is she? 13?

- Are you serious, man?
- Ellie.

Oh, no.

Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.

Fucking manager.

Five years ago,
that guy was Henderson's weed dealer.

And he would not know talent
if he was choking on its dick.

- Cool.
- Let's just go.

I would follow your brother,
but I think you'd agree,

I need to follow
the unprotected 15-year-old first.

What's up, you need a ride home?

Um, nah, I'm good. I'm a few blocks away.

No candy from strangers, huh?

Have fun.

Ellie.

You scared me.

Oh, okay, this cannot be our thing.

What, are you following me?

- No, I was at the show.
- Why?

You're not funny.

I was with a friend.

Listen, I have to ask.

Uh, hanging out with Henderson,
you know, your... your sister has...

history with him.

Oh, my God.

Did Delilah put you up to this?

Yeah, 'course I know she slept with him.

He's one of a hundred,
she's one of a thousand.

- So why are you hanging out with him?
- I'm not.

I'm chasing an internship.

And Delilah's okay with that?

I stole Henderson's email
from her contacts.

Don't you dare tell her.

- Ellie, you know guys like that...
- Guys like what?

Wait, let me guess. She called him a perv.

Know who else she called that?

Half the fucking cast
of Sesame Street, okay?

It's her go-to.
And who do you think you are?

Oh, my God, you're so kind.

You're so protective.
You're like my daddy.

- Is that what you like to hear?
- No.

- Do you want to fuck me, William?
- No.

- No, yeah, of course you do!
- Never mind.

Of course you do!

Everybody wants to fuck the 15-year-old!

Oy, she's precocious, all right.

I'll leave the parenting
to her sister for now.

Especially because
I have caretaking needs of my own.

Cafe Gratitude.

What's the occasion?

You got laid, didn't you?

Tell me everything.

U.

You're an arm away from death.

Serves you right for changing the subject
away from your lady friend.

Well, there's nothing to talk about,
we're still friends.

Still platonic.

But why?

'Cause her pheromonal effect on you
ceased overnight?

No, it's not that I don't still...

Well, what are you trying to prove?

That I won't repeat history.

With respect...

you need to see a shrink
'cause you are fooling yourself.

Your deal is we're all subconsciously
trying to date our moms over and over.

Patterns are set young,

and all romance is basically
reenacting parental dynam...

What? I'm quoting my shrink.

- Oh!
- And... and he's right.

Both my mom and my fiancÃ©e
are very withholding.

I'm sorry, are... are you married?

Engaged.

Her name is Gigi.
She lives in the Philippines.

Is this the one
you sent all your money to?

Yeah, man. I told you I love her.

We met online.

One day, we'll meet in person.

Will, you are 100% disqualified
from giving me relationship advice.

It's Manila.

Well, yeah,
I gave you the biggest hint ever.

Wait, hey, are we just gonna play games
until my meds run out again?

If I have a future at this company,

corner office, natural light.

Transfer to another branch.

When I know,
you will be the first to find out.

Wait, you're not eating?

No. No, the lady friend's a baker.

What?

Stop playing games
and just wife her already.

Hey, and while you're at it,
take her name and give mine back to me.

Hey, Love.

Hey. How's it going?

I'm already drooling.

Shit.

Well, that's embarrassing.

Were... were you expecting something?

What? No. No, I didn't mean...

It's not like I'm owed a muffin.

- A muffin?
- Uh, a strudel.

Maybe a light religieuse.

Oh, great.

Three-hour project,
I'll get right on that.

This is weird, right?

All I meant was that I'm grateful
for whatever I can get.

Which is...

whenever you want.

- Or if you don't...
- You're right, this is weird.

Shit. If I could kiss you right now,

you'd know I meant no harm.

But apparently, friendships
are more fragile than relationships.

I'm sorry.

For what?

I just don't know what you expected.

Sport.

Hi.

So, uh...

Now that I know
you're not a crazy person...

- I gotta ask.
- And here it comes.

What are your intentions with my sister?

Apologize to you, marry you,

send your brother
out of strangulation's reach.

Intentions?

Yeah.

Not to be all like, you know...

but um...

if you were to hurt my sister,

I could make life
very difficult for you at the store.

Love and I are just friends.

Don't get me wrong, she's amazing.
I'm the problem.

I'm kinda getting over some stuff,
you know?

I'm working on myself.

Oh, shit.

Dude, are you...

Are you in recovery?

- Nope.
- Kinda.

Man, me too. Which... which program?

SLAA?

Wait.

Just because I choose to live so openly
does not mean you have to answer that.

I'm in AA, and you know...

for right now...

that's enough.

Thanks, man.

Yeah. You know, I um...

actually have this killer idea
for, like, a psychological thriller

set in the world of celebrity rehab.

Let me guess.

An addiction counselor
turns out to be a celebrity stalker?

Holy shit.

I think you just cracked it.
Are you... are you a writer?

I'm just a reader.

Speaking of Love...

does she seem off to you?

I think I might have offended her.

I wouldn't sweat it.

She's, like, very wound up lately.

She's always baking.

But like...

who bakes for the baker?

You know?

Your brother's right.

I've been taking your talents
and you for granted.

Maybe in my attempt to give you space,

our friendship's become one-sided.

Maybe I can feed you like you feed me.

Don't walk out on me!
Ellie, stop right there!

Are you or are you not
dicking around with Henderson?

Good, Delilah, set her straight.

Are you or are you not spying on me?

You were at his not-so-secret set.

Not exactly discreet.

- How much did you pay Will to follow me?
- What are you talking about?

The house manager texted me.
She's one of my tipsters.

Listen, Ellie...

Henderson is bad news.

- You need to believe me.
- Why?

I don't even know what happened
between you two

because you won't tell me
anything about it.

Maybe because there's nothing to tell.

You're a walking after school special.

Hey, not everything is a story, okay?

You think everyone is damaged
because you're damaged.

Matter of fact, you love damage so much,

you made it your full-time job,

and it turned you ugly.

Oh, hey.

One,

what the fuck are you doing
creeping around my sister?

Two, why the fuck would you not tell me?

Delilah, I ran into her.

The last thing I wanted was any of this,

but so you know,
I actually did try to talk to her,

and she said... she said it was harmless.

Oh, okay. Yeah, good neighboring, okay.

Did you reach her little heart

with your little words?

She's 15, Will!

Doesn't matter what she thinks
because the age of consent is 18.

She said it was an internship.

Really.

How can I help?

Just...

stay the hell out of the way
while I take down the bad man.

What are you gonna do?

Same thing Ronan Farrow does,

except faster and with a personal agenda.

It's only a matter of time
before I Harvey the shit out of Henderson.

I have rumors and sources,
and eventually I'm gonna have evidence.

Her heart's in the right place.

I just wish I could trust Delilah
to protect her little sister.

More to the point,
I wish I could trust Ellie, period.

Full disclosure,
I put some family-friendly spyware

on the new phone I gave her
to protect myself.

Crazy the lengths parents have to go to
to keep an eye on their kids these days.

- Now, it's going to help me...
- It's a new phone.

...protect her.

I wasn't lying, Love. The last thing
I want to be in is her business.

But I meant it when I said
I'll make myself worthy of you.

That means not turning a blind eye
to obvious cries for help from a child.

Here's what I've learned so far.

Teenagers' inner lives are,
on the outside, boring

and borderline nonsensical.

In Ellie's defense,

she's smarter than her chuckle buddies.

Bottom line, though,
Henderson's correspondence

seems as benign as the others.

She seems to be working for him.

He seems to respect her taste.

And all of their texts are about films,

which brings us to tonight's event:

obscure film screening
with a group of mixed-gender adults.

Not my idea of a good time,
but, I gotta say, harmless.

I think I can stand down,
which is a relief because, frankly,

I've gotta focus
on salvaging our friendship.

Let's face it, me baking for the baker

is a one-way ticket to a kitchen fire.

So I'm getting creative
and I owe my inspiration to your brother.

Love and I
were making our own breakfast

from total junk every morning.

Oh, no.

I stole it from work.

Don't tell my boss.

Okay.

Fancy!

Mm! It smells like absolutely nothing.

Well...

That, my friend, is where you are wrong.

S'il vous plaÃ®t.

Merci.

Et voilÃ !

Chilla Wafers?

I have not had this since I was a kid.

- Forty put you up to this.
- Kind of.

But he neglected to mention
you call them "Chilla Wafers."

Oh, yes. This is an art.

You take the challah,
you soak it in the cocoa,

then you take that wet blob
and you put it between two wafers.

- That sounds delicious.
- Will, it is...

...terrible.

Like, inedible.

Please don't actually try this.

It's the thought that counts.

And so, uh...

What is this called?

It's breakfast, it's lunch,
sometimes it's dinner.

It was the best I could do as a kid.

Which, you know, well, uh, it's pathetic.

Anyway, try it. Try it.

Uh...

I'm sorry.

I am so sorry.
I did not mean for this to be romantic.

Are you kidding?

I mean, look at this.

Are you a sociopath? I mean...

I told you, I'm... This is...
I'm trying to not hurt you.

And I told you that's stupid
and giving me zero credit.

Okay, I don't...
I don't care what you think you are,

I care about your actions, what...

what you do.

And these mixed signals, I mean...

peak shitty.

Oh, Love.

I'd like to ask if you're okay,

but I don't wanna be accused
of hitting on you.

What do you care?

I don't want the plants
to be over-watered.

- Ellie, if something happened to you...
- Oh, my God.

Just shut up about Henderson.

It's not his fault, okay?

- What do you mean?
- We were all watching a movie.

There were snacks.

I ate...

something.

Next thing I knew,
I was lying on the balcony.

Henderson was a good guy.

He chewed Jonah out for the edibles

and he even paid for my town car.

Ellie, are you saying you don't remember,
like you lost time?

Don't.

You sound like Delilah.

Shit. You can't tell my sister.

She'll blow things
way out of proportion. Please.

Please don't tell her.

Okay.

I won't tell Delilah.

I'll just have to do
the parenting myself.

Tell me how to hack a celebrity.

I...

require more information.

Henderson. An underage girl.

Probably dozens.

That's all you need.

Okay, but hacking?
What are you looking for?

Evidence he's a pervert,
something that'll take him down.

Are you doing this for the baker?

No.

I'm trying to protect a kid.

No offense, but you don't strike me
as the vigilante type.

Which means you're getting something
out of this other than altruism.

Like...

sense of self-worth?

To prove you're a good person?

Will...

listen to me closely.

If you don't quit the faux shrink bullshit
right now and help me,

I will know you are a bad person,

and I have no trouble
doing bad things to bad people.

I...

bow to your superior self-justification.

I can probably hack the man,

but first I require two things.

One,

the dude's jacktop.

No celeb keeps gross shit
on the cloud or their phone

since Celebgate 2014.

So if he's smart,
he's got a dedicated perv device, hence...

Jacktop, okay.

What's the other thing?

A second laptop.

With WiFi.

Not a chance.

I need to download my tools, man.

Unless you know Python, Perl, Lisp...

There are ten ways you could send
an SOS with one minute of WiFi...

Linux, Nexus, Hashcat...

Or I could teach you how to hack.

By the time we're done,
your victim will be of legal age.

What is going on with you today, huh?
What is this?

Don't blame me. You're the one who has
all the time in the world to work out.

I've been swamped.

I've been managing our parents' store,

rewriting my feature,

and now I'm in development
on False Promises with Will.

It's like Promises in Malibu,

but with fake people.

Yeah.

I get it.

Didn't know you two
were spending so much time together.

Why are you so prickly about Will, huh?

Is something going on?

If something's going on,
you should tell me

because... twinsparency.

You know, it's really funny

how you only seem to care
about twinsparency

when you have nothing going on.

Wow! Wow!

Fuck that. Come on.

You know I'm just trying to protect you.

Why are you all up in my shit today?

Because you're avoiding.

You keep glomming onto people thinking
that's what's gonna make you successful.

Will can't help you.

You need to help you.

Why don't you just do the work?

Or maybe you're threatened
by the possibility

that Will and I could become closer
than you ever could.

Good game.

Yeah, write a script.

Fuck.

The plan: get in Henderson's house,

get jacktop to Will.

Not my first rodeo, thank you, Peach.

But this one's a celebrity.
Finding his place...

Surprisingly easy.

Oh, he bought his historic Hollywood Hills
compound from dear friend Judd off-market.

Address unlisted, of course,

unless you look for Joshua Bunter in LA
voter rolls, which are public record.

Libertarian. Fucking sleazebag.

Henderson's pad,
built in the 20s, four-bed, three-bath,

original tile, shallow-pitched
exposed wood ceilings,

and very high walls.

Scratch breaking and entering.

I need to be invited in.

Which means scoring an invite
to a legendary Henderson party.

VIP only.

It's too bad my dear friend Forty
is non grata.

No, I need to befriend somebody
on the edge of fame.

Henderson's pre-celeb pals.

And what better place to find a nobody
who thinks he's somebody...

than the improv crowd.

Cross-reference Hendy's Insta tags
with Facebook

with people he ats on Twitter
out of his hundred thousand followers,

and you find...

Freddy.

He's my ticket in.

But in order to become an insider
in the cult of improv,

I've got to speak the lingo.

Freddy's whole thing is yes-and.

Only gets you so far.

Then the game of the scene takes over.

God help us.

Scenes are built on agreement.

Someone makes an offer.

Chucky said you want to kiss my peepee
behind the swingset.

No matter what, you say, "Yes, and..."

Yes, I said that.

And...

I want him to watch.

Which is a great way to indoctrinate
female teammates into Hollywood.

You want to be famous? You gotta be game.

Someday, if you're lucky enough,
you can say yes-and to Henderson.

All right, guys, that's our show.

Thanks for coming.

That was great. Good job.

I'm glad you could see me up there
'cause you could see me in my element.

Nobody advances in this cult
with talent alone,

they climb with heat, connections,

and for that,
I must channel my dear friend Forty.

Hey, Freddy.

Yeah.

- Great show.
- Oh, thanks, man.

- You used to be in WolfJizz, right?
- Oh, yeah, totes.

And that team had instant group mind.

Totes. I saw you at Del Close
a couple years back.

Eugene said you were a must-see.

Oh, you know Eugene?

He's but the tip
of a second-hand bullshit iceberg.

Man, Eugene is the best teacher

I've ever had.

Such strong initiations.

Like, I got to guest spot
a few fuck around shows,

and watching him and Billy
and Henderson mind-meld...

- It's church.
- They're good, yeah.

You know? So I just moved from New York.

You and Hendy
used to be on a Harold team, right?

Oh, Chudthumper?
You know that?

- Yes! Your object work was brilliant.
- That group was crazy.

Oh, thanks, man.

Hey, uh, speaking of Hendy, you know
about the after-show thing at this place?

- No, but it'd be sweet to catch up.
- Yeah, you should come.

Gate code is D-I-C-K-S.

- Classic Henderson, right?
- Classic.

- I'll see you there?
- Yeah.

Chudthumper...

Well, that was only mildly debasing.

Now, all I need
is to slip in and out with a jacktop,

unnoticed in a stream of white guys.

I know, I'm using my privilege for good.

Old sport?

What are you doing here?

No. No way. Did he follow me?

I hit it off with someone at the theater.

Did you and Henderson make up?

Not yet, but I'm seizing the bull.

I'm... I'm doing the work.

I'm gonna pitch False Promises
live and in the flesh.

So go ahead.

Poor bastard didn't even get
an invite.

So much for unnoticed.

Forgive me, Love,
I've gotta ditch your brother, ASAP.

"Dicks." Classic.

I want to know who from
the Family got cut from the guest list.

Take care. Send me the pic.

See that chick?
That's Henderson's agent.

- I'm gonna find a bathroom.
- Okay.

It's risky to leave Forty
in a force field of anti-sobriety,

but I'm not his babysitter.

I'm here for Ellie.

Tina.

Tina.

Forty. It's been a minute.

Oh, what are you working on these days?

I'm so glad you asked.

I have got this psycho-sexual thriller

set in a, um, a celebrity rehab facility

that I think Henderson
would be perfect for.

It's real, it's fucked up,

- funny, star vehicle...
- Oh, wow. How does it end?

Well, you would need to know
the beginning and the middle...

Wow, sounds promising.

- Yeah, let's set up a meeting and we can...
- No.

Mm-mm. No way.

Why?

Forty, you know when people
talk about having it?

You don't have it.

It is a combination of talent
and work ethic.

And I'm telling you this to help you

because you can have ideas
and nothing to say.

But here's the silver lining:

you're rich.

You don't need to struggle.

You could, like, finance
indie films or something.

You'd be so good. You're so fun.

Think about it, okay?

I love you.
I'm trying to protect you. Mwah!

Mm-hmm.

Henderson's inner sanctum.

It's so... normal.

It's a certain kind of assault,
but bad taste does not a predator make.

I wonder how many people Josh alienated

as he climbed the mountain
to become Henderson.

And how many girls Henderson traumatized
once he had all the power.

It's Chekhov's knife.

And as soon as we see it,

then you know throats are gonna get cut.

But we don't know whose,
and we don't know why.

Sure, she's...
she's cutting an apple right now,

but the audience
is gonna be subconsciously terrified...

Oh, shit.

...for the human apple.

It's powerful, man.

Old sport!

I am pitching False Promises

to these fine fuckers,

and I'm on page six,

which now that I'm saying it out loud,

feels like page three.

I should leave, I should just leave,

go help Ellie, let Forty screw Forty.

Sport? Sport.

Forty, hey...

Forty, your sister's asking for you.
Let's get out of here.

No.

Boo-oo!

Party foul!

Tell her... tell her I'm mid-pitch.

I'm en fuego. She'll get it.

Forty!

Please, let me take you home. Come on.
You don't want her to see you like this.

- Yo, Captain Buzzkill!
- Why not?

This is exactly...

what she expects, promise.

Do you have any idea how painful it is

disappointing someone who is that perfect?

You would be surprised.

Hey, you know what?

You need to be drinking that swill
if you're doing blow.

- Get down. Hey, easy, easy.
- Henderson, Henderson.

- Yeah, no, I have a pitch for you.
- We got a lot of catching up to do, buddy.

All right? But let's just, uh,
not mix business with pleasure.

Let's just call Tina and we'll set up
a meet with the both of us.

Henderson's trying to help.

- No, I'm... I'm good. Let's talk.
- No, no, I know you're good.

As a matter of fact,
I'm the one that's tired.

Actually... Everybody, guys,
I'm tired, so...

All right, whatever.
Fuck you, young people.

I'm in my 30s, I'm down a nut,
and I need my eight hours, so good night!

Did this guy just tank his own party

to make Forty feel better about leaving?

- Oh, Henderson, man, I owe you an apology.
- No, shh.

- I'm really sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey. You're a delicious prince.

Okay?

Get home safe.

Bygones are bygones.

Here, I'll get you to Love's, okay?

No, no! No, please, please.

I don't... I don't want to go to somewhere
funded by Quinn blood money.

Don't... don't you get the curse yet?

Okay, okay, then we'll go to mine.

- Okay.
- All right?

Hey, buddy, do I know you?

Will. We, uh... we met at a party, Valley.

- Oh, the finger guy, right? Yeah.
- Yes.

You're Delilah's friend.
So you know Ellie.

Yes.

And...

she's very smart.

Did you just yes-and my small talk?

Yes, and I regret it.

Hey, keep practicing.
That was really good.

She... Ellie is...
Is she your intern or...?

Yeah, that kid is so, so smart.

Ah, it's the least a privileged
white male asshole can do.

Hey.

- What did he take?
- No idea.

It happened so fast.

I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry.

What did you take?

Would you mind putting on some tea?

I'm sorry.

There you go.

Do you think I'm talented?

Of course I do.

- That's why I push you.
- But...

do I have to, like...

live in a shitbox like this
to be a real artist?

Like...

where even are we?

Hey.

You're with me.

Always will be.

And that's all that matters.

What's the point?

Even if I made something really good now,

nobody is gonna care about it.

That's not true.

Whatever you write, I can't wait...

to read it

'cause it's gonna come from you.

I'm sorry I didn't look after
your brother tonight.

It's not your job.

It's mine.

And Forty's fragile.

Life just keeps kicking the shit
out of him.

Always has since we were kids.

Everybody sees the money.
They don't understand he never...

He never had a chance.

Oh, when he was little, he was confident.

Creative.

So sweet.

Then, this one summer...

the year my parents launched Anavrin,

they left us with this...

fucking crazy au pair.

Forty saw way too much, too young.

Now I'm the one
who picks up the pieces because...

he needs someone.

He's a good person.

He just does some bad things sometimes.

I'm sorry.

That's hard.

But that's love.

See, this is what I'm talking about.

I'm not perfect either.

Codependent brother...

A widow...

You haven't even met my parents yet.

You deserve better...

than another broken soul.

We're all a little broken.

Yet some pieces still manage
to fit together.

Shh! He's sleeping.

I told you.

We have to be quiet.

You're a different kind of
woman, Love.

This time will be different.

I will never hurt you.

If anything, we can heal each other,

and I promise, I'll never take
your cooking for granted again.

Morning, old sport.

How do you like your eggs?

Sunny side up.

And I will try my hardest to accept

being in a damn throuple
with your brother.

How much longer?

Ask the shitty burner you bought.

Well, good news,

dude was easy to crack.

The bad news, the dude was clean.

It's impossible.

I scrubbed all his files, accounts,

search history, Pornhub.

Well, I did my job.

If I'm willing to put my faith in Love,

then maybe Ellie deserves the same trust.

She's smart.

How you feeling?

Embarrassed.

Hey, I'm really sorry
I puked in such close proximity to you.

- Ah...
- It was a bad edible.

So gross.

Thanks for not narcing me out.

It's on your list.

A bookseller gets murdered
in the first 20 minutes,

so, uh... if it's too much for you,
I'll understand.

All right, gotta get to Hendy's.

The hustle never stops, William.

You're gonna come home
to the first book on your list.

- It's a hardcover.
- I'm already bored.

For Ellie, something dark,

funny, ambitious,

a break from the dreck
that crosses Henderson's desk.

Bettelheim.

- Oh, speaking of.
- So here is the crusher.

I have been...

giving it some thought,

and I don't think False Promises
is gonna happen.

It's a short story, not a feature film.

Oh, I'm sorry. That's a real shame.

It's okay.
We'll think of something better, right?

A real showcase for Henderson.

My lunch with him
is still on the books for next week, so...

That's great.

Hey, can I ask?

What happened between you two?

You know, I don't actually remember
much of the night in question.

I mean, there was not much at that party
that wasn't in my system.

It was all gonna...
come up eventually, right?

Just wish it hadn't been
all over his secret toy room.

- Secret toy room?
- Yeah.

It's one of those old Prohibition houses

with the hidden speakeasy doors.

Henderson has transformed it
into this whimsical little...

creepy dungeon, I guess.

And I went full Exorcist on that shit,
just like...

You said it's creepy.

Imagine if you collected kids' stuff,

yet also were low-key
a bit of a fucking sadist in the sack.

- That.
- A secret room.

Huh.

I'm disappointed I missed that.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

I take care of him
every single day.

All day long. And you're gonna bawl me out
for one night with my friends?

You think I'm stupid?

- You think I'm gonna believe this shit?
- No. I think you're paranoid.

You need help.

I'm not done talking to you.

- Don't touch me!
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

- Let go of me. You're hurting me.
- You think I'm a fool?

Is that what you think of me?

- Why can't you just do right...
- No, please!

...and love me
like you're supposed to, huh?

It's been said
that dreams are illustrations

from the book
your soul is writing about you.

So why do I keep dreaming
about my childhood?

Dr. Nicky would have said
I have unprocessed feelings

about how my parents
didn't take very good care of me.

But now you do.

In so many ways.

Hey, you.

You make me kinder,

more selfless.

You make me feel good.

So good, I forget whatever darkness
resurfaced in my sleep.

I lose myself in you,

find myself through you,

and when I'm with you,

we're the only two people on Earth.

It's Forty.

Can that wait?

No, I ignored him three times last night.

Okay. Hey.

Lovey, where you been?

Uh, Phone died. What's up?

Ted Hope is what's up.

Ran into him at NeueHouse.

Told him I am this close
to attaching Hendy to my new project,

and he wants to see the full pitch.

Can you even process that?

That's great.

That's really great.

Now all I need to do is mind meld
with our idea machine, Will.

You haven't heard from him, have you?

He... um... hmm.

Yeah, you know,
I haven't heard much from him.

The guy must really not be feeling well.

Yeah, poor guy. Oh.

One other thing.

My inner Sasquatch is coming out,

so I'm gonna need you
to, uh, cut my hair before this meeting.

Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon?

Yeah. Uh, why do you sound
so out of breath?

I'm on the elliptical, you know. Gotta go.

Old me would be annoyed
by such an intrusion.

But new me

wasn't even fazed by it.

- And you know why that is.
- Oh, right there!

Because I finally feel

like I'm becoming a better man.

That's so fucking good!

And it's all because of you.

Didn't peg you for an outer space guy.

Oh, it came with the apartment.

Along with the pink, fuzzy pillows.

Hey, you can see my house from here.

All the better to spy on you.

Not that I've needed to
since I trust you completely.

Let me guess.

Forty?

When you text him back just...

don't tell him about us.

But if your brother knew about us,
maybe he'd give us some space.

Remind me again...

why "us" is a secret.

Whenever I start dating someone,

Forty tends to feel threatened.

You know, he doesn't have
many people to count on

so he needs me.

And his sobriety is always
the most fragile in the first...

you know, right after he's slipped.

Let's just give him a week or two

before we, you know,

shove our euphoria in his face.

Even your empathy is a turn-on.

If you're euphoric now, just wait,

just wait until Santa Barbara
this weekend.

I know.

And there goes Santa Barbara.

What if...

we take a rain check

on Santa Barbara?

The more time you spend with him now,
the cooler he'll be when we do tell him.

Anything for you, Love.

I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

Okay.

Well, I guess that means
we'll have to make up for that

lost Santa Barbara sex some other way.

So, this is what it feels like
to be nourished and at peace.

Um what do you think you're doing?

Working on a project?

What project?

I told you, I don't want...

I'm not hanging out
with Henderson anymore.

Why? What'd he do?

He just drinks too much.
It's embarrassing.

This explains why she hasn't
been texting Henderson all week.

Huge relief.

Goetz's dad's girlfriend needs a PA

for a short that starts shooting
next week.

Painfully derivative,
but a credit's a credit.

Till then,

I'm expressing myself through collage.

I never thought I'd say this,
but I feel for Delilah.

She's only trying to protect her sister
from the same sleazeball

she fell victim to.

Just... do not ruin my walls.

Yeah, she so wants to be at power top.

- Tell me about it.
- Mm-hmm.

Can you believe she put
that spy software on my phone?

Shit.

- You sure it was her?
- Who else would it be?

So you're not gonna tell her you know?

Obviously not.

It's way more useful
if she thinks it's still working.

This is what I get
for trying to out-tech a teenager.

It's a good thing I have another way
to keep tabs.

Henderson's jacktop.

Even if he's realized
it's gone missing by now,

I've disabled Find My Friends,

and he hasn't been diligent enough
to un-sync his IMs.

Ellie hasn't fallen in line,

she's gotten craftier.

I could tell Delilah, but then
I'd have to explain how I know.

Or I could take care of it.

The brave, good, right thing to do,

the kind of man you'd want me to be.

People have secret rooms
to hide something shameful

and doubtless, illegal.

If I find what Hendy's hiding,

I can get him arrested and Ellie safe.

I'll make you proud.

With Hendy out of town,
perfect time to get back inside his house.

But first, there's someone else
I have to take care of.

Eat it up.

I paid a lot
for those macrobiotic sea vegetables.

Okay.

Okay what?

Okay, let's have the conversation.

If I let you out...

then what?

Is this a joke?

No, the only joke is me pretending
that keeping a man in a cage

is helping me be my best self.

No.

What's your plan?

My plan is...

to forget any of this happened...

and to live happily ever after
with Gigi in Manila.

Gigi, Will's internet fiancÃ©e,

a.k.a. least promising plan of all time.

If you bring me the Beast Wars box
in my coat closet,

I can make a fake passport,

and you will never hear from me again.

I have an idea.

You like games.

Love 'em, in other contexts, dude.

Right.

I will let you out...

if you prove

you'll never turn me in.

Prove my loyalty?

And how am I supposed to do that
from inside a cage?

I don't know. You're smart.
I believe in you.

Don't give up.

You need something
to get your brain juices flowing.

You need a project.

What do you need this time?

I need Henderson's home security disabled.

He's hiding something.

Sounds familiar.

You're gonna need a jammer.

Question is which kind,

so I'll need to know what system he's got.

Oh, am I allowed to touch a laptop

to help you...

help me help you do this thing?

Stop. That one.

Is that a sign by the hedge?

People put those signs around their house
to make them feel safe

because they are, respectfully,

idiots of the highest magnitude.

'Cause it only makes it easier
for people like me

to find out which frequency
they're broadcasting on.

Once you jam the frequency,

all the sensors are disabled.

Good ol' Hendy has obviously
never seen The Bling Ring.

Okay, Hendy, where's the toy room?

What is this? Like a Narnia situation?

Oh, Mr. Tumnus.

Huh.

Wouldn't have pegged him
for a Dickens guy.

Oh, how very supervillain-y.

It's like Hendy's id
ate too much candy and porn

and threw it all up.

'Cause nothing's worse
than a sex dungeon with dust bunnies.

Could he be more obvious?

Delilah was right.

He's a bad man
who deserves to be punished.

It's only fitting
that she break the story wide open.

Come on.

You can do this.

Attagirl, get to work.

With Hendy being capably dealt with,

I can go back to my Love bubble with you.

No, you don't understand.

- Oh, my God.
- Yes, please.

- [That is crazy.
- {Love] Hey!

- Look who I ran into.
- Hi.

Old me might have been annoyed
by this coincidence,

but your friends are refreshingly chill
and easy to talk to.

I read in our Kundalini Cookbook
that golden milk is a life-changer.

Into Kundalini, okay.

Actually, I'm not, but Gabe is.

Constantly retweets his guru.

I mean, I'm just curious, I'm a novice.

Oh, I can help you out with that.

- Will it help my stress-induced gastritis?
- What?

Oh, Emma showed up to set the other day
with her head and eyebrows shaved,

so I spent the last 72 hours
emotionally blowing the director

just trying to get her, like, un-fired.

- What've you done about the tummy stuff?
- Ashita..

- Good.
- But she says it's a pitta imbalance,

Of course.

Yeah, but she refuses to do blood cleanse.

Because it tastes like fresh anus.

Did she just say "blood cleanse"?

Tell me you're doing reiki. Come on.

Or, you know, cupping will help.

This is great, but it's not
gonna work because, hello,

it's past life trauma.

Always.

Shit, that wasn't a joke. Say
something. Say something, anything.

Have you tried going to the doctor?

Like, a Western medicine doctor?

I'm kidding.

I'm obviously kidding.

That's funny.

I mean, everyone
has their own lens, right?

Of course.

You're disappointed.

I flunked, I embarrassed you.
How do I fix this?

Okay, can we just tell 'em?

Okay.

We didn't accidentally run into you guys.

- We planned it!
- Yeah!

- Surprise!
- Really?

- Yeah.
- Well...

If I didn't know you better,
I'd call that a sneaky,

insecure Beck kind of move.

Do I know you better?

Okay, so...

I just thought...

that if I was going to meet
your insanely tight inner circle,

you know, I would get in my head

and, like, research everyone, and...

I just wanted you
to be able to be relaxed.

You did this for me.

Okay.

Then can someone please tell me
what the hell a pitta imbalance is?

- Oh, yes.
- Oh, honey.

I thought you would never ask. Um,

it's usually stress-induced...

I love him.

And just like that,

I'm part of the tribe.

No longer on the outside looking in,
thanks to you.

Did you invite him?

No.

Hey, Forty, I thought it was your day off.

Just coming in for my green juice.

- Well, join us. Grab a bun.
- Yeah.

Wait, Love, weren't you checking out
agave wholesalers today?

Yeah, I was going to
and then we all ran into each other.

Mm-hmm.

Why don't you just sit down?

Why?

So you can lie to my face right now?

Yeah, I've been knowing
that you two were hooking up.

And I was just waiting
for you to come clean.

And you don't even have the decency

to invite me to your coming-out brunch.

We can talk when I cut your hair...

No, you're not touching my hair!

Forty, this is not the time or place.
You need to stop it now.

Hey, hey. Just let him go.

What Forty needs are boundaries.

Oh!

It isn't him.

He's punishing me.

God.

I hope he's not drinking.

I should... I should text his sponsor.

Honestly, you could both
use some boundaries.

But I don't blame you.
Every one of us has a blind spot.

No.

I shouldn't.

This is crazy.

I am... crazy!

You're not crazy.

You are trying to be a good sister.

Here is where old me would suggest
you need to distance yourself,

even if that meant pushing Forty
further toward the edge.

Then why do I feel so shitty?

But new me, the me I'm becoming
because of you,

is going to make this better for you, me,
and Forty.

Forty wants to be...

Can you just...?

Forty wants to be included.

All right? So let's include him.

Standing Sunday brunch thing.

Beach day once a month.

Once.

Yeah, I think he would really like that.

Starting now,
I'm gonna be a better friend.

I'm gonna help him come up
with a killer pitch.

Busier he is with a viable project,
the less dependent he'll be on you.

I cannot ask you to do that.

You didn't. It would be my honor.

Aw, man.

That...

That was heaven.

That was medicine.

They should bottle you, Delilah.

They should.

You okay?

What? Yeah, yeah.

You sure? You seem...

kinda distant.

I'm sorry,
are we that kind of fuck buddy now?

You know, we can talk about real stuff...

without violating
the fuck buddy code of ethics.

It's... It's been done.

Okay. Um...

I am... dealing with a thing.

And I could actually use
some professional advice.

Like from... Yeah, of course.

But like so fucking off the record,
it's not even funny.

Okay, OTR, I got it.

Okay.

Someone anonymously...

sent me some photos that I know for a fact

were taken by a certain
high-profile celebrity.

And some of the girls in the photos,

maybe all...

are underage.

That prick you've been trying to nail,
Henderson.

Maybe one of your sources
is trying to give you some more ammo.

Maybe.

I want to write the exposÃ©. I want to...

nail his one remaining ball
to the ceiling, but...

the more that I think about it...

I'm one of the girls.

Oh, no, man, Delilah...

And if I break the story,
and it comes out later

that the same thing happened to me,
then I lose all credibility.

The whole story just gets picked apart.

I could take the photos into Sex Crimes.

I'll say that I got them anonymously.

Yeah, so some star-fucker cops
can get paid off to bury them? Yeah.

I know the right people
to talk to, Delilah.

Don't you trust me?

Okay.

Come on, people must have told you
you look like a model.

- We should get a drink sometime.
- You're single?

It's complicated.

I'm going out of town tomorrow,
but I could take you out tonight.

Tonight doesn't work,
but how about now?

Seems like you've got
your hands full already.

Oh, he's a big boy.

I'm gonna need you to stay here for a bit.

Read your book. I'll be back.

- Don't go too short like last time, okay?
- I'm not.

You asked me to do this.

Top of the morning, will.i.am.

I hope we didn't wake you.

I hope we did.

So I can apologize
for losing my shit yesterday.

Oh, it's already forgotten.

You are one magnanimous motherfucker.

And we...

are going to make a great team.

Right. I told Forty that you said
you would help him with his project.

- Only so I can have more of you.
- Absolutely.

Schweet.

I had to push the Ted Hope meeting
because I was irate after...

Well, we don't need to talk
about the brunch anymore.

Uh, but It's fine. I'll pitch him
when he gets back from South By.

Sounds like a plan.

But you and I should get started
this afternoon.

- Okay.
- Also, Lovey said something

about all of us going
to the beach later today?

Oh, right.

Sooner than I'd care to, but...

Great.

But I need Love...

to go with me
to buy a new suit for the pitch.

Sure, let's go shopping.

No, like, just me and Love.

I get self-conscious
when I go suit shopping because of...

my thighs.

Forty, Will and I have plans.

It's fine. Will doesn't mind.

Do you, old sport?

Your brother is a monster.

Not at all.

Happy shopping.

Becoming a better person
is way more aggravating than I thought,

but I'm still going to find a way
to help your brother.

How's book one?

Margarita just rescued the rape victim
from eternal damnation.

So, uh, you know... light beach reading.

That's the book guy?

He doesn't play for your team.

No fair. You already have Hendy
so why do you get all the hot zaddies?

Okay, first,

Will is like a eunuch to me.

And Hendy?

He is not my zaddy either.

Which reminds me,

I'm going to his screening tonight.

Text me and invite me to sleep over
so D thinks I'm at your place.

Thank you.

Why hasn't Delilah
gotten Henderson arrested yet?

Flaming Hot Cheetos.

Stress food, very bad sign.

Management should really get that fixed.

What do you need, Apartment Three?

Just wanted to make sure
you got that envelope on your doorstep.

How did you know about that?

I saw a girl drop it off.

What'd she look like?

I saw her from behind.
She had a... hoodie.

Why?

Nothing.

Doesn't seem like nothing.

Hey, is someone harassing you?

No.

Delilah, I've seen the look on your face.
If someone is bothering you, just...

- Hi.
- Hi.

If someone is bothering you,
go to the cops.

- I'll go with you.
- Would you relax? Nobody's stalking me.

This is about Henderson.

The woman you saw dropped
his kiddie porn photos on my doorstep.

Well, this is great, right?

I showed 'em to a cop,
and he said they're useless

and he can't do shit with them
because Henderson's not in them.

And the backdrop's completely nondescript.

Bastard's smart.

- Shit. Shit, shit, shit!
- So what are you gonna do?

Stick 'em in a drawer until somebody else
blows the whistle on him.

If the police had found them on Henderson
or in Henderson's house,

then they could've made a case,
but as it is...

whoever swiped them
bungled the shit out of this.

Double fuck!

Promised to help your brother,
but now I have to make sure

Ellie doesn't
walk into the jaws of perversion.

I'll have to keep it short with Forty.

Sit down.

In the end,

our guy has to murder all three women.

It's like... the ultimate irony.

So what do you think?

That it sounds like the most
anti-feminist horror film in history,

- which is saying a lot.
- I think it's really good.

You don't think it gets wonky
in the middle?

- No.
- You don't think we need to, like,

spitball that page 90 shit?

He's not going to let me leave
until I say...

Honestly, I think it's genius.

Okay...

don't throw the G word around
if you don't mean it, Will.

- I do.
- I knew it.

Man, I wish I could go
to South By Pitch Fest tomorrow.

It's fine.

Gives us more time
to work the dough, right?

I think we are on a roll.

I think... we should go all night?

How do I get out now
without this six-foot-one baby

throwing a tantrum?

No, no.
You don't want to overwork the dough.

I think you should go to South By tonight.

Pitch it tomorrow.

- For reals?
- Take the red-eye.

You said Ted Hope is there, right?

Show him you're in demand.

Start a bidding war.

- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

- I'm gonna do it.
- Good for you.

Where you been?

At the market.

For four hours?

You should ask your son.

He wanted to play hide-and-seek
and scare Mommy.

I'm gonna get the rest of the groceries.

You're old enough to know that your mom...

sometimes accidentally tells a little lie.

But I know you always tell the truth.

Come here, Joey.

Come here.

Pain, it can make people truthful.

Hey.

What you doing with that rope?

Don't worry, it's for Henderson.

Uh-huh...

And what exactly
are you planning to do to him?

Gonna get him to confess on video,

ruin his career, and get him arrested.

Why? What'd you think I was gonna say?

Someone else, not you...

a less stable person might see...

Hendy's depravity
as justification for killing him.

That's not me.

I know.

I know it's not.

You're thoughtful, controlled...

The more I learn about you,

the more clearly I see
the answer to your question.

How can you...

be sure I'll be loyal once you let me out?

The answer is...

there is no answer.

No matter what I say, you will never
be sure if I'll turn you in.

But I need to be sure, Love, for us.

Hold on.

I know you want to do the right thing

or you wouldn't have asked at all.

I've done business with bad people,
you're not them.

You...

do bad things when you feel trapped

or, key, to protect someone, which...

we all hope we would have the courage
to do that.

To me, that makes you more good than bad.

I think you're a good man.

You could kill Henderson,

but you're letting justice
take its course.

That's what a good man would do.

He's biased, but I hope he's right.

But to really be good, Joe,

you have to let me out of here.

Another impossible puzzle, Love,

but for you, I'll try to solve anything.

It's not the best time,
but you always come first.

Hey, you.

Did you tell Forty
to take a red-eye to South By?

I may have mentioned it, yeah.

I really wish you would have asked me.
Film fests are tough on his sobriety.

I didn't realize that, I'm sorry.

I appreciate that,
but it still feels weird,

like you were trying
to get him out of town

so that you wouldn't have
to deal with him.

Being attracted to very smart women
is a double-edged sword.

- I would never do that.
- He said you used the words "bidding war."

I should lie.

Half-truths just end up getting me burned
so I should lie.

Will, please do not make this worse
by lying to me.

I have to because I can't tell you
the whole truth,

which happens to be I did it
to save someone helpless.

Speaking of, need to stop her, now.

Hello? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm... I'm here. I'm here.

You're right.

I just wasn't thinking. I messed up.

And from now on, I'll do better.

I promise.

That is what I needed to hear.

Now I have to go.
I don't want to miss my flight.

- Your flight?
- Yeah.

I'm going to be Forty's sober companion
at South By.

Kill me now.
Kill Forty, kill everything.

- Have a great trip.
- Call you from Austin.

Perfect. Now I have to get Ellie out
of Henderson's, then get his confession.

I'm not sure how to do either.

What could go wrong?

- @Ellie-Eyeballs, hey.
- Hey.

So bad news.
Jonah's girl came down with the flu

and Jonah's the one with the print,

so no screening tonight. Sorry.

Here, I'll call you an Uber.

Wait, dude, I came all this way.

We can still hang.

I can show you my short.

It's still in progress, but...

Listen, we're friends and it's cool.

I mean, you're massively cool, but...

you're also 15,

so we're not hanging out
in my house alone.

What is his game here?

Okay, neurotic.

I'm not some random girl child.

And you said for weeks
you would watch my short.

All right, fine.

But you have to promise me
you won't tell anybody

that you were here alone with me, okay?
'Cause it's kinda...

I get it.

I'm a vault. Scout's honor.

Oh, this is his clever trick
to make her feel safe,

like she chose.

You're a filmmaker.

I saw some Rear Window
and a little bit of...

Florida Project, but with your own pathos.

I... I think you could've
held on the last image a bit longer.

That's what I was thinking.

I'm proud of you, Eyeballs.
Now I really wanna hear your feature idea.

Great. I've got a whole pitch prepared...

And I have, like, a super early morning.

Dude, ten minutes.

It's right up your alley
and I think you'll like it enough

to share it
with your producing partners, really.

Well, I never pitch without
at least one Scotch in me for luck,

so in your case, what do you want? Juice?

Uh, yeah, I'll take a watermelon.

Okay.

No alcohol. Interesting.

And a twist of GHB
for roofie-ing the teenaged girl.

What the heck?

A little piece of advice: don't get a cat.

Here.

Cheers.

To making art.

To his dose kicking in first,
which it will.

It's a hell of a lot stronger.

All right.

What the fuck. Hey.

Hey, hey.

Huh? What?

Easy, easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

Who are you?

Untie me!

- Oh, white male celebrity privilege.
- Help me! Help! Help me!

You know this room is soundproof.

- You built it to be soundproof.
- Help me!

Help me!

I'm going to help you after you confess

to what you've been hiding
in this little...

secret room.

Secret room? What...?

You mean this room
that everybody knows about?

This is just standard, mass-produced
Pleasure Chest kink.

It's not illegal.

Hiding his real perversion
behind healthy fetishes is smart

and evil.

I'm not talking about kink,

I'm talking about your thing
for underage girls.

Like the one upstairs, for starters.

Ellie? I never touched her.

I don't have a thing for underaged girls.
This is insane!

The pictures in your cigar box
suggest otherwise!

Those aren't mine.

I'm holding them for a friend, all right?
He knows he needs help.

I'm not gonna kill him.

Just scare him into telling the truth.

What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?

No, no no! What do you want?
What do you want?

- Ow!
- No, no! What do you want?!

You know what I want.

The truth.

Okay, okay!
They're mine, they're mine!

Okay, I... I never touched them, I swear.

They would fall asleep
and I would take their tops off,

snap a few photos, which I wouldn't
share with anyone, and then...

Who gets hurt? Nobody.
They don't even remember.

Delilah remembers.

You're wrong.

And if you believe any
of what you just said, you're sick.

These are kids.

Listen, man,
if I did this to your girlfriend...

a long time ago or something,
I'm really sorry.

I'm sorry. I...

I can pay you both.

I don't want your money.

I want your confession on video.

What?

I can't do that.

That would destroy me.
I'd lose everything.

Oh...

You deserve to.

No, no, no! Okay, okay, okay!
I'll do it, I'll do it! Please.

Remember...

this is of your own volition.

Okay.

Don't look so scared. Take a breath.

Now, look into the camera.

What do you want me to say? What, I'm...?

I'm a sicko?

Okay, fine, I'm... I'm bad.

All right, I'm disgusting.

What, do you think I like this shit?!

My stepdad, he... he touched me.

Stop that.

When I told my mom about it,
she made me promise not to tell anyone.

- No, stop. I don't want stories.
- All this started when I was nine.

- I was only nine years old.
- Henderson... Henderson, shut up.

- This happened to you too, didn't it?
- No. No, no, no.

- That's why you're doing this?
- No.

You hate yourself
so you're trying to destroy me?

I'm warning you.

- We're the same.
- No, no...

I'm nothing... like you.

I know you. You...

You're from my party, right?
You're Forty's friend.

You were trying to help him,
you were trying to be a hero.

Is that what you think this is, huh?

You feel like you're a piece of shit
so you're trying to be a hero.

- That's enough.
- Ruining my life is not gonna save you

from your demons, all right?
What we went through, this shit stays.

No amount of sex or drugs
or success or religion

or surviving fucking ball cancer,

that's not gonna save you, okay?
Nothing can.

He's trying to get in my head.

- Love can.
- We're nothing alike.

Love is the biggest phony of them all.

You want something real?
An orgasm is real.

He's desperate.

He's trying to win with words and ideas
that add up to nothing,

but the truth: he is bad.

Someone needs to stop him
and he knows it.

No.

No, this isn't me.

This isn't me anymore.

I didn't want to do that.
I didn't do that.

Get it together.

A suicide.

He slit his wrist, regretted it...

went for help, fell going up the stairs.

No, no no no, can't have another
jar of urine scenario.

Shit.

Hendy?

All right, later, loser.

I'm leaving.

I just have to clean up my blood.

No, no, no!
That is my blood mixing with his.

The robots are not our friends.

This can still look
like an ill-conceived suicide.

I just need to clean what got smeared

while leaving the rest alone.

I can still be good.

Tonight was just a setback.
Everyone has setbacks.

Okay, okay. Be cool.

- Is there a problem, officer?
- You were illegally crossing, sir.

A little late
to be taking out the trash, huh?

What's in the bag?

Stuff... for Goodwill.

This is it, the end of our story.

Hendy was right, I was delusional
to think love could save me.

What the...?

These are limited edition.

They're too... big.

They're yours if you want 'em.

All right, here.

I was gonna write you up
for jaywalking, but, uh...

you can go.

I've been spared.

I've been saved,
and there has to be a reason for that.

Maybe it's because Hendy was wrong.

Love is real, and I have more to give.

Hey, man, uh, can I get a Texas Trio?

And the bread, is that gluten-free?

Do you have gluten-free bread?
Could you work that out for me?

Yeah, we got that. No problem.

How are you, dude?

Good. Just getting my grub on.

Gonna go on a a diet for sure.

Maybe it's because I help people

who need someone to look out for them.

Growing up,

I felt unsafe.

Powerless.

I'm so sorry.

You kept Mama's secret.

Joey, you're such a good boy.

Do you want to know another secret?

One of these days...

I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

All your fake passport stuff,

everything you need.

You're...

letting me out?

This might be the dumbest mistake
I've ever made,

but if Will's right,

it's also the one thing that will prove...

that I'm good.

I knew it.

I knew you'd do the right thing.

I can rest now, Love,

knowing I'm the man you want me to be

and the bad is behind us.

- You ready?
- Yeah, but we need to buy another ticket.

I met this, uh,
total smokeshow at breakfast.

We were both reaching for the queso,

and it was, like, this...

insane destiny moment.

That's not like you.

I know. Um, I just...

Look, I've never felt
like this before, okay?

Just, like, instantly, like...
Oh, my God, there she is.

You look amazing.

Um, this... this is my sister, Love.

Hi.

I'm Amy.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

I cannot believe
there are no charging stations.

Fucking Arizona.

Well, we could call a tow,

but, uh, you know, what the fuck,
it's gonna take way too long.

Let's just take the PJ.

I know jets are wasteful,

but I don't want you driving
through the night,

and my mom...

really hates it when people are late.

God, I cannot wait for you to meet her.

- What time is Love getting there?
- Who knows?

She's on her new boyfriend's dick
like herpes.

Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but...

Will, right? She's bringing him?

Yep.

Move, Joe.

Wait, stop! Stop!

Stop, Candace.

I love you.

Just let me go.

Tell me you don't love me.

I don't! I don't love you.

I never have.

What are you gonna do about it, Joe?

Don't do this!

Stop!

Looks like it's gonna be
a proper meet-the-parents Wellkend.

Oh!

Hi. Yeah.

Forty Quinn here.

Yes, like the number, but spelled out.

F-O...

I now truly understand
the term "love of my life."

My life makes sense now with you in it.

Complete. Not closed.

More open to the world
and everything beautiful than ever before.

Nothing to hide.

You've asked me to meet the parents.

Might be messy, family can be.

But whatever comes,
we'll get through it, together.

I don't wanna.

Can your parents really be that bad?

Worse. They can be worse.

Okay, remember,

they charm so that they can manipulate.

My mom is a lot.

Just give in to her crazy.

And my dad is impenetrable.

Just don't take it personally.

Try not to.

I still do.

Is there anything I can do to support you?

We could have a signal.

Like...

What is that? Are... Are you Spider-Man?

No, no.

Um, it's... it's, uh...

ASL for "I love you."

In, like, a friendly
you know, like, platonic way.

I love you.

In the non-friendly way,

but I'm waiting to say it.

Why rush when we have
the rest of our lives?

Hmm!

My dad's gonna like that shirt.

I know. I do my research.

America's surrogate dream parents,
Ray and Dottie Quinn.

Ray is a Pasadena golden boy

who comes from old-school money.

Dottie is the spark plug
that gives him life.

They met in the naked hot tubs
at Esalen,

eloped shortly thereafter.

Joan Baez is rumored to have officiated.

Dottie opened Anavrin
with Ray's family cash.

What started as a pet project has evolved

into a global brand largely due to Dottie,

all centered on the Quinn family motto,

"Transparency and realness."

This weekend is Ray and Dottie's
30th anniversary,

and they're making up
for their quickie wedding

with a wellness bacchanal.

Ray and Dottie's vow renewal
will be the culmination

of packed community...
say it with me now...

"Wellkend."

Shoot me in the face.

But whatever you need, Love.

These people may pretend to be real,
but you and I really are.

- Speaking of messy family...
- Hey.

Did you know Ja Rule
and Ashanti never banged?

Okay. And?

I don't know, it just kind of ruins it
for me knowing their love was never real.

Can you check out?
It fucks up inventory when you steal.

- Is that kombucha?
- Stop being so codependent, okay?

'Buch has about as much alcohol in it
as fresh-pressed juice,

and I want to pour one out for Henderson.

Because it was our thing.

Did you hear they're saying
it was a suicide now?

Too good for this world.

Another melancholy clown
dies by his own hand,

and his adoring fans
and acquaintances grieve deeply

for, oh, about the next one
to two news cycles.

Are you making it to meetings?

I'm in such a positive place right now

and AA is a breeding ground of negativity.

Speaking of circle jerks,

you still coming to Mom and Dad's
Wank-end?

Yes, of course.

Forty, just promise me
that you won't do anything...

Gotta go. Amy's in the whip.

Is everything okay?

Yeah.

No.

Forty's gonna go off the rails again.
I can tell.

It's gonna be bad.

You like the girl he just met, right?

Sure.

We went to the movies.

We didn't even talk.

What can I say? He's on pattern.

Meets a girl, each a new
impossible-to-predict type of bad for him,

and then he tries
to get our parents to like her,

then he flings himself off a cliff
when they don't.

Leaving you to clean the splatter.

I can neutralize.

I can distract. I'm good with parents.

We got this.

Sure, I could tell you
were my sister is, but...

what is this about?

It's about Joshua Bunter.

- You might know him as...
- Henderson.

Clearly, I need to be
in two places at once,

with you and near Ellie.

Just crossing the T's here.

We know from Henderson's IMs he was
planning on seeing your sister that night.

Yeah, I don't read the news.

It's, like, so depressing,
but I... I thought he...

offed himself.

Delilah's smarter than these guys.

Yeah, well, it seems that way.

And I've got parental tech
to keep an eye on Ellie

and the fallout
from Hendy's tragic suicide.

Well, Ellie's not home right now,

but I can call you when she is
if you want, or, like...

Oh, no. I have to go into work.

I'm sorry.

Bye.

Were you at Henderson's
the night he died, Ellie?

What are these?

- What do you think they are?
- Don't evade with a question.

- You evaded with a question first!
- Jesus!

Half the time you treat me like an adult,

but, wait, suddenly, I'm a kid because
you can't get it together to be an adult?

You really wanna know?

Those are Henderson's.

No, they're not.

They're random.

They're... He's not even in 'em.
They're just...

I know...

because he did it to me.

I don't believe you.

- Where's your photo then?
- You don't believe me? You need proof?

Listen, don't get mad at me because
he was a bad guy and you fell for it.

He was my friend!

He wasn't your friend, Ellie!
Let me guess.

He made you promise not to tell anyone
you were hanging out alone together?

Basic predator move.

You are a lot of things...

but you're not stupid.

Ah, ooh, ooh! Hi.

- Hello.
- Hi, babe.

Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you guys are here.

Oh, my God.

- How are you?
- I'm good.

Yeah, this is great.

Well, thankfully,
teenagers text emotional gibberish,

so I know Ellie's okay.

All right, put the phone away.

Welcome to the Hellmouth.

And I'm in a Wes Anderson movie

set in a weirdly Caucasian ashram.

- Hey, Dad.
- Lovey, hey.

Hey.

This is Will Bettelheim.

Oh. You related to Bruno?

Ray's a not-so-secret fantasy fan.

He's referring to Bruno Bettelheim,
author of...

The Uses of Enchantment is a classic.

No relation, I'm just a fan.
It's good to meet you, Mr. Quinn.

Call me Ray.

Will?

Finally we meet.

Oh!

You are delicious.

The pleasure is all mine, Dottie.

Come here, darling. You look beautiful.

- Hey, Mom.
- I'm sorry, I'm all over the place.

- Let's get you a drink.
- Okay.

Sounds good.

- Forty.
- Sport! Hi, Love.

Where'd she go? There she is.

You gotta meet my girl, Amy.

Amy, come here.

Hi there.

Will Bettelheim,

Amy Adam.

Nice to meet you.

It can't be.

Am I hallucinating?

This is her hand, this is real.

Candace is here.

Will Bettelheim...

What a great name.

Almost sounds made up.

Is she trying to spar with me?

That's funny, I was just thinking,
"Amy Adam."

How totally un-google-able.

This is a game to her.
She's enjoying this.

I'm so happy to see you again.

She's crazy, Love.

I'm also so hungry
I could eat my own hand, so let's...

- Oh, no, don't worry. Just eat mine.
- Oh!

Like the kids say, "Fuck my life."

Oh, good, you're awake.

Shh-sh-sh-sh.

It's okay, you are totally safe.

I have a surprise for you.

Can you promise to be calm?

Okay, good.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said. I'm an idiot.

Okay, I'm stupid. Let's just go home.

You're just saying that
because you think it's what I wanna hear.

No, I'm saying that

because I'm tied up in the back of a van.

I had to...

so we could get here...

to talk.

I am so sorry.

- But it's all gonna be worth it.
- Where are we?

Lake Mahopac.

You remember that amazing picnic we had?
I brought all your faves again.

No, just, okay...

I know... I know you don't want to hurt me.

- I would never hurt you.
- Just untie me. Untie me.

I can't do that yet, you know I can't.

Just hang on.

Thanks. Thank you.

Candace!

Listen, you don't understand.
Don't do this!

Stop! Please, don't do this!
Shh! Sh-sh-sh-sh!

Stop...

Stop!

How?

How did she manage this?

So tell, tell! How you two met.

We're dying to hear.

- Yeah, tell us.
- Well, we were at...

- South By.
- Yeah, and...

- Amy was giving me stalker eyes.
- I was interested, but so was he.

- So she reached for the queso.
- Oh, the queso!

- And, um, it felt like...
- It was fate.

Inseparable ever since.

Enjoy it while it lasts.

Yeah, we actually road-tripped
back from Austin.

Got to know each other
a little bit better.

And what are you doing?

- Amy is an indie film producer.
- Oh, come on.

[Forty[ Yeah,
we're actually already in soft prep

for a film we're trying to get going.

Honey?

He could pretend to care,
like, if he wanted to.

Wow, these waiters are so slow!

Oh, you want a drink?
I'll... I'll grab you a drink, bunny.

Yeah, could I get a 'buch, please?

- Virgin, obviously.
- Yes.

Appreciate you.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

What are you doing here?

I told you I'd show up
to give you what you deserve.

So here we are.

Merry Christmas.

How do I get this time bomb
away from you, Love?

- Want to know how I found you?
- I would love to hear.

So, I was feeling like shit
one fine afternoon,

when I saw this clickbait
about how the stars live.

I mean, who doesn't need
a little escapism?

So I clicked and there was this link

about how all the cool kids
go to Henderson's house,

and although
I wasn't familiar with his work,

I was curious about this random douchebag

high as balls on his coffee table,

which is when I first set eyes
on my new dreamy beau.

Of course, your brother
destroyed my life,

our life.

And he's such an idiot.

And I keep watching and...

No.

Couldn't be.

Could not be.

I was trying to help you, Love.

Altruism is dangerous.

Shocked you'd choose LA.

But I found you.

Great.

What's the move?

You gonna tell them this dramatic tale?

I mean, it is their special weekend,

so I'll wait if and when I have to,

But in the meantime, I am going
to protect them from you, bunny.

Especially...

your gorgeous girl.

Lucky man, Will.

- I missed you, babe.
- Aw!

Yeah, we can, uh,
situate ourselves for dinner.

The fuck?

I didn't know you bite your nails.

I don't.

Not since I was a kid.

Well, what, is meeting my parents
making you nervous?

'Cause I don't care what they think.

And now I have to do this vow renewal.

I cannot believe
I have to call my parents "lovers."

Then don't.

- Do you.
- No, I can't. My mom gave me a script.

I mean, she said, "Make it your own,"

but I'm pretty sure
that means, "Don't change anything."

Do you want some space to work?

I can go to Forty's yurt.

Yeah, actually. I mean, if you don't mind.

No.

The kombucha thing
is not a good sign. I just...

- I know, I get it.
- Okay.

Don't get lost out there.

I will help you, helicopter sibling.

I need to keep eyes on Candace
so I can protect you from her,

but...

lest I accidentally stumble
into Jeff Bezos' lodge,

I need the blessed yurt map.

Will?

Everything okay?

It's perfect. Thank you.

I just, you know,
wanted to check out the Truth Yurt.

- I was also looking for...
- Care to partake?

- I don't really...
- I insist you be here now.

Okay.

It's fine. I won't inhale.

Now inhale.

So, fresh in from New York, huh?

Yeah.

I remember being in New York
when I was a kid.

Ah, to be young.

Oh, you're still young.

Tell that to my vagina.

No one warns you.

You wake up one day drier than the Sahara.

If it weren't for this wonder lube
we've developed,

I don't know what I'd do.

It's already so difficult
to reach orgasm at this age.

Is this really happening?

Anyways,
it seems like you understand, Will.

What a chin.

She's not flirting,
she's testing me.

I'm drugged. She hopes it's truth serum.

I think your daughter
is the most amazing woman...

I've ever met.

I like you for Love.

Between the obstacle course
that is Dottie,

and the more fundamental issue,

that every millisecond
of this Wellkend is scheduled,

how do I get Candace alone?

How do I do this, Love?

How do I get her away from you?

Let the wolf awakenyour unconscious.

Meet your id.

Hey.

On the plus side,
she's striking out with the Quinns.

Schadenfreude is karmic suicide.

Dad, do you actually...
Do you have a minute?

Not now, son,
I've got doubles with Bozzi from the Palm.

Right. Sorry, Bozz.

Let's go, Bozz.

Shit.

It's okay.

Forty always...

you know, tries to impress our parents
with these girls.

Can you just help?

Ali Wong's in studio
to talk about Henderson,

or as she knew him, Josh.

I will make a film that premieres
Sundance 2020 at the Eccles.

Friday night slot.

Then goes on to sweep the Gothams,

winning two, no,
three Indie Spirit awards.

Fuck the Oscars.

I hear and accept you, Forty.

Is this gonna work?

'Cause my car is really old.

Yeah, that shiny, new Prius is all yours.

All you need is a group hug and 35K.

I...

will find the perfect partner.

That's good.

We hear and accept you, Gabe.

I will fulfill my life-long dream...

of... traveling to Italy.

Italy?

Seriously?

She is obsessed with me.

Okay, come on,
somebody needs to help her. Go.

- I accept you.
- I accept you.

I hear...

and I accept you...

Amy.

You... sorry um...

I'm not feeling well.

- I... I think I'm just dehydrated.
- It's okay.

Don't fear love.

Hug.

I'm... I'm sorry,
I... I just need to lie down.

Don't... try... anything.

I am texting someone
on the outside every hour.

You hurt me or the Quinns,

I reveal your identity to everyone,

and everything to get turned over
to the authorities.

Are you crazy?
I'm just trying to talk to you.

Oh, you mean like the time
you left me for fucking dead?!

She can't hold a knife.
One swift move and...

No, no, she's wrong, I don't hurt people,
especially women,

especially when they're
out of their minds.

No, that is not me.

Candace, can we...

- please just have a truce?
- Stay...

away from me.

I think this is just
some big misunderstanding.

Stop gaslighting me!

You don't want to protect them.

You want to hurt me.

Go ahead.

Do it.

I can't.

It's a lot harder than it looks.

What are you guys doing in here?

Hey.

Is everything all right?

Yeah, um...

Allergies.

Will snuck me some Claritin. Thanks, man.

No problem.

Let's go.

Time to get pretty.

Ooh.

All right.

All right, well...

So, I brought two,

and you can pick whichever one.

Oh, I'm... I'm fine with either.

Amy, are you okay?

Look, I know my mom can be a handful.

And I know my dad can also be a handful.

Thanks. It's... it's...

not really that, it's more...

You can tell me anything.

I am a vault.

I don't want to sound crazy.

Well...

you won't and you aren't.

Something bad happened to me...

out in a place like this.

Just, I... I got lost with a guy
who I kind of thought was bad news.

It... it turned out fine, though.

Well, that's good.

Yeah, I mean, you're...

probably being triggered.

Trauma lives in the body, so,
you know, you can't control it, but...

At the risk of sounding like my mom,

maybe Shaman Open can help.

It's... it's really no big deal.

You and your family
have been so welcoming.

- Oh...
- And also cool.

I'm glad you think so.

So tell me,
how did you and Will meet?

You two seem so great together.

Oh. Um... work.

I basically forced him to date me.

Ooh, does that get complicated?

- Working with someone you're dating?
- Not really.

Does it get complicated
with you and Forty?

Oh, no, we're great. We're... we're good.

He... We're actually hiring.
Cinematographers.

Already?

Isn't that a bit early?

No, just... just establishing...
like, tone.

Yeah, where do you work?
Have you met my friend Lucy?

She works at United.

- Oh, I'm independent.
- Mm-hmm.

And I usually just fly Southwest.

I meant the agency.

- United Talent?
- Oh, right. Um...

No, no. I don't think I've met her.

No, it's...
It's an easy mistake.

Dad. Finally.

Um... did you get my email?

It's not every man
that can pull off linen.

Can you say hi to me at least?

Forty, I don't want to hear it.

Okay, okay.

Uh, look, I know, but...

Amy actually has a really
incredible idea...

Amy.

Ugh, another walking visible panty line.

Let me guess. She wants to open a...

vegan junk food restaurant,
like Krystal-with-a-K?

Will,
ask him how much he wants.

In times of triangulation,

it's best to stay awkwardly quiet.

Did Forty tell you how he doodled
on his SAT Scantron?

I had to donate a building
to Dartmouth to get him in.

Okay, Dad...

you know that I've struggled
with drug addiction on and off, my...

It's not eczema, Forty.

Addiction's not an on-and-off thing,
and it's no excuse for being a bum.

One hundred K,
this is the last time I ask.

Will... Will has heard the pitch.

Yeah, I have.

I think it's a great idea.

Your son shows real promise.

Well, if my son wasn't such
a big flapping pussy,

he wouldn't need other people
to carry his water for him.

I'm not writing you another check.

Get a job.

And a life.

Well...

That is my Postmates.

Yo quiero Taco Bell.

Forty. Forty, are...

Are you okay?

Yeah.

He's a douche, and I am so done

with all of this vegan bullshit.

You should come with.

Uh, you can service my sister
post-chalupa.

What does the future hold?

Okay. Um, what were you and Amy
talking about earlier?

Oh, why? Did something seem...

No, no. I just...

I caught her in a lie.

And, uh... now I'm worried.

I knew we were on the same page.

I agree, she's...

she's the worst.

Get rid of her now.

Wait, what?

No, that's aggressive.

And, plus, it would upset Forty.
I mean, what is going on with you?

Wrong page.

I know we're not in the Truth Yurt,

but we can still be honest
with each other, right?

You've been... off.

You feel weird, ever since we got here.

I want to tell you everything.

And I will, soon, but for now...

You want to know why I'm weird?

'Cause your family is insane.

I warned you.

You warned me? Your mom can't stop
telling me about her vagina.

She did what?

And your dad,
I just stepped in it with him

trying to help Forty,
which you asked me to do,

and then he made me eat a chalupa,
and now I'm sick.

Wait.

- Forty ordered Taco Bell?
- Yeah.

What...

What? What's happening?

Well, I have to go.

Forty always orders Taco Bell
before he relapses.

You are so obsessed with your brother.
This is not normal.

Just to recap,

you now have a problem
with my mom, my dad,

Forty, me,

- this chick Amy for some reason...
- You don't like her either.

I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I am trying...

to be the perfect boyfriend.

I want to be so badly,

but you fed me to the wolves, literally.

Thanks for making a stressful weekend
so much worse by starting this fight.

Our first fight.

I blame Candace.

It's time for her to go.

Um, no, I... I...
I look like cat shit right now.

I'm on my period.

Okay, who gives a fuck. Just let me in.

Jesus, what kind of assholes have you
dated that care about that kind of stuff?

Why are you here?

Uh, I need those pictures back.

Um... why?

I think you look great...

for the record.

Yeah, uh, they're trying to get a full
picture of what Henderson was into.

I told them that I got a lead on someone

who has some knowledge of some
young girls that we could follow up with.

D, they want to know why he did it.

Okay.

What's wrong?

I left them right here. I...

Hi.

Have you guys seen my brother?

No, not since cornhole.

Are we literally drinking
the Kool-Aid right now?

Goodbye, cruel world.

Candace must go,
but first things first.

Time to apologize.

You're more important than my pride.

Love, I'm sorry.

I cannot be the one
that makes you feel better right now.

I am looking for my brother
and trying to handle my mother and...

Okay, I'll help. I'll find Forty.

Okay.

Thank you.

- Delilah, hey.
- Hey.

Any chance you're with Ellie?

That's what I get
for not parent-spying on her for an hour.

No, but I... I have some texts from her.
Hang on.

Okay, uh, the... the Alex Theater
is doing a Chandler thing.

- You could try that, but I gotta go.
- Okay, thanks.

Fucking crackheads.

Um...

My parents aren't just parents,

they're lovers.

They're, um...

I hate rom-coms.

I do. Take away my ovaries.

Want to know why?

Because throughout my life,
when I look at my parents,

their love doesn't feel like one.

You know, it's, um...

fighting over which toilet paper to buy.

And then...

plunging the toilet together
when it gets clogged.

It's being there...

when someone's damage
makes them impossible.

Knowing...

that they are so much more
than their worst moments.

You're not talking about them.

Contrary to internet opinion,

my parents' love is not perfect.

You're talking about us.

It's, uh...

It's sticky,

messy,

often potentially way too much to handle.

But it is so much better than perfect,
because...

it's real.

Wait. Wait, I want to go.

Forty...

No, I want to go. I want to go.

Um...

- Forty?
- Um, remember...

when they, uh, they dragged us
to the Hoffman Institute

because, uh,
they had differing definitions

of the word "monogamish"?

That was real.

- I have more. I just, uh...
- Enough, son.

I... I just need a smoke.

Just need a smoke.

Oh, um, not that one. No, it's fine.
It's... it's okay. Got it. It's okay.

- It's okay.
- Oh!

It's fine. Everything's...

You look lovely, Mom.

Let's go. It's okay. Shh.

- I don't feel good.
- Yeah.

I do.

Let's party!

Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

- How are you guys doing?
- You've done enough.

All you ever have to do
is keep your brother safe. You failed.

You disgust me.

You're a fucking hypocrite.

Earth mommy dearest.

Oh, Love.

It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I saw what your mom did.
Are you okay?

My dad hit me a lot.

Why couldn't you tell me?

Probably...
same reason you couldn't tell me.

I couldn't tell you
because I wanted us to stay us.

I didn't want it to be polluted
by all this fucking...

I guess...

my life has been dark.

Well, who you really are...

the dark, that's not a burden.

You don't have to push that away from me.

I want to know you.

I want to know you.

You know, the more I get to know you,
the nicer it is.

I don't just mean the cute parts.

As far as I'm concerned...

we will stay us...

no matter what.

Yeah, I feel like I've been, um...
I've been acting weird,

and I feel like it's because
there's all these things

that I felt like I couldn't tell you,
but, like, fuck that.

Okay, um...

You remember the, um...

the Nilla Wafers, the au pair?

Of course.

My parents started Anavrin

when we were, like, 13.

And they hired this woman, Sofia.

She was, like, 19. She was from Spain.

The way Forty tells it...

she was his first love.

To this day, he does not acknowledge

that it was was abuse.

And eventually my parents
caught them together,

and...

so much shit ensued.

And... they let her go.

And she was troubled.

She killed herself.

Forty's the one who found the body.

Yeah, and nothing has ever
really been the same.

My parents kept everything quiet
with money.

Yeah.

I get that Forty is a lot. I know.

And I know
that I take care of him too much.

But...

you've met my parents now,
so you know why.

I'm stuck with him.

No.

We are.

I don't think
I've ever been in love before.

It's been infatuation.

This is it.

Accepting you're not perfect
and loving you more for it.

What the fuck?

I'm sorry, did that trigger you?

Can I tell you I love you yet?

Whenever you're ready.

In the meantime, let me say...

I love you...

Love.

Ugh, it's a complicated word.

Oh, yeah.

Is there another word we can use?
Our word?

Um...

I wolf you.

I wolf you too.

I like it.

It's like you're part of my pack.

I am your pack.

- Hey!
- Klepto.

The police came for these.

- The actual police or your fuckboy?
- Why would you take these?

I couldn't believe he would do this.

But I do now.

I'm sorry I was being such an asshole.

It's okay.

I think we should burn those.

If these photos were ever leaked...

every time someone googled the girls,

it would just...

What would you want done with yours?

Hey, just so you know...

nothing could ever
make me see you different.

Tell me again what happened.

Um, my boyfriend... ex...

We fought.

And he...

He took me to the woods.

Um...

I don't remember what happened next.

I just... I... I woke up.

Like...

buried.

We sent a car out. No tire marks.

No, he dug a grave.

A lot of tree removal in that area, right?
Loose dirt.

No one saw anything?

You happen to take any pictures
or save any texts between you?

No!

He has my phone!

I mean, isn't there any DNA
where he buried me alive?

This isn't CSI, all right?
We're in Putnam County.

So you have no proof?

Honey, let me level with you, all right?

I looked you up.

You have a rap sheet.

Ever had any friends go through
with reporting assault?

This'll be labeled domestic violence.

This isn't...

He tried to murder me.

The best we can do
is get a restraining order.

Right, temp for three months.

For a permanent one,
you'll have to stand before a judge,

- so will he.
- But it will be permanent?

Well, three years.

And then file again.

If you have no pics, no proof...

What am I supposed to do?

He thinks you're dead?

You want some really
off-the-record advice?

Stay that way.

This is unreal.

Figured you'd come find me.

Crazy family
we've fallen into, huh?

So now you see I'm not...

I'm not afraid of you anymore.

If you really had something on me...

- you would've turned me in already.
- I'm not afraid of you either.

Why would you be afraid of me?

Candace, it was an accident.

End of story.

I never tried to kill you.

Yeah. You know what they say?

You never know if you're fight or flight
until you're forced to find out.

Turns out...

I'm fight.

So now I found you,

I'm not going anywhere,

and I don't care what story
you tell yourself,

because all I have to do
is wait for you to mess up.

Murder has a way of following you.

And you're not getting away with it.

Things aren't over with Candace.

But I have to rest
before I plan my next move.

Wellness is exhausting.

Huh.

A postcard from Will in Manila.

It's going well with Gigi.

If I stay committed to being a good man,

things might work themselves out.

My God, why aren't they burning?

We need kindling.

Oh, man.

Evidently, there's toxins in Polaroids.

All right, there's one more.

- Aw.
- I wolf you.

Mm. Do you now?

Yeah.

Do you want to go to the stockroom?

Yes, I would like that very much.

Stop with the PDA.

Before anybody asks...

Amy picked me up from a meeting,

where I found a new sponsor.

Can't name names, but, uh...

let's just say the Academy robbed him.

Anyway, I will have to make amends.

So I promise I will apologize
to both of you...

whenever I get to that step.

You don't need to do that.

I'm just glad you're okay.

I really am.
And, um, I'm staying busy too.

I mean... adapting this book
Amy found for us is going to consume me,

in the best way possible.

Thank fuck we got that option.

What's the book?

I thought you were busy prepping
Bang, Marry, Kill.

Yeah, that felt like more
of a second feature.

But, uh...
Amy turned me on to this memoir.

Yeah, this main character, Beck...

she really speaks to me, you know?

- She just wanted to be loved.
- Mm.

- She's worse than Eva Braun.
- Oh! Ugh!

Anyway, just waiting for the deal points
to come through, but...

Oh, my God.

Holy fuck.

- No way.
- What?

- Hold on.
- What happened?

No way.

Now they're saying
they think Henderson was murdered.

Benji, Peach, Beck,
Ron, Jasper, Henderson...

Well, if... if that's true,
a famous man like Henderson,

they won't stop
until they find who did it, right?

- Right.
- He won't get away with it.

Murder has a way of following you.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

Who here among us really knew Henderson?

The famous belong to everyone
and none of us.

Well, I knew him pretty well, I think.

One time, before I was
about to go onstage,

some dude comes over
and dumps wine all over my front

on purpose.

Well, Hendy sees this,
and what does he do?

Number one,
he punches the guy in the face.

Number two, he took off his own shirt

and gave it to me.

And number three,

he pulled this perfectly clean bra
out of his pocket

and gave that to me, too.

Oh, by the way, that was
during his comedy prop era, of course.

I think.

The point is,
I don't care where he got the bra...

I heard they found his body
in a sex dungeon.

Come on, Gabe.
Don't kink-shame the dead.

No, I'm not, okay?

But I loved him. You know why?

He was real. Damn it, Hendy.

A tale told by an idiot...

She's still here,
hanging on like a sucker fish.

Embraced by your friends.

Everyone's happy you get a break
from your gig

as Forty's primary caregiver,

but I will be victorious
in this war she has waged.

Stop her permanently.

Not Henderson permanently,
that got away from me.

But permanently nonetheless.

I swear to God, if they ever find
the cowardly shit stain who did this,

I'm going to bash his fucking head in.

- Forty.
- I know this is hard,

but you need to find a silver lining,
bunny.

Bunny. What an absurd nickname.

I used to find it sweet.
But it's not sweet. It's psychotic.

A bunny boiler is what she is.

He was murdered, babe.

When my ex attacked me,
it was the worst day of my life.

But I didn't lay down and die.

I came out stronger.

That's the thing with tragedy.

It makes you live for the now.

Yeah. Live, for now.

No, no. This can be managed.

Move in with me, Ames.

Ditch the B and B, and be my hausfrau.

Forty, Forty...

maybe... maybe it's not the best
to make big decisions

when you're grieving, you know?

Can you just let me have this? Please.

Like...

I can't be here, okay?
I, like, need some matcha.

Forty.

I think Vampira is buried right over here.

Speaking of which,
I spy the coveted third totem.

What?

- Where?
- What's happening?

Wham and bam, girls.

Oh, my God. I think you're right.

Oh, both wearing the shit
out of that pink lacy dress.

Oh, my God! You got number three!

- Right.
- Yeah!

What's number three?

Oh, right. You're new here. Okay, so...

We have this theory...
well, it's actually Gabe's theory,

which is that Los Angeles
has seven totems,

and once you find all of them,
you're officially an Angeleno.

- And can never leave.
- Yeah.

We all found them ages ago,
but Lucy never found the dress one.

- Hey, till today.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- No, this one can count for you, too.
- Oh, great.

Stuck in LA forever,
what could be better?

Are you all right?

- You seem...
- Like a guy attending the memorial

- of a guy he just killed?
- ...pensive.

- I have to keep it light for you.
- It's funerals.

Of course. Um, yeah.

- So, what are these totems?
- Oh, oh!

Got it, lovely. Thank you.

Uh, number one,

a rollerblader in booty shorts.

Number two, a ghetto bird. Um...

Police helicopter.

Number three, two starlets wearing
the same dress, as observed.

- Uh, number four, a pack of coyotes.
- Oh, yeah.

Right? Yeah.
Number five, a dog in a stroller.

Number six, an off-brand superhero.

But out of context,

not in front of Grauman's
'cause that's too easy.

Yes, of course. Uh, and number seven,

a palm tree... on fire.

- On fire.
- Yes.

- It's on fire.
- Right.

Sounds intense.

Yeah, they are.

Of course Delilah is here
with a flask.

This must be hard on her. That's my fault.

But I saved her sister from far worse.
This I know.

Especially in the rain.

Hey, um, I gotta pop by work. So, later?

A celebrity has died suspiciously.
They'll work harder to solve it.

Did I do enough at the scene?

- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Little late to be taking out the trash.

- For Goodwill.
- Hey.

Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Of course.

I wolf you.

I wolf you so hard.

Okay.

Bye, guys.

- Bye, Lovey.
- Bye, babe.

Thanks to Forty, I have new intel.
Candace has an Airbnb.

She needs a place to lower the mask,
to be herself.

I'm going to find it,
and when I do, Hollywood ending.

Happy anniversary, Mr. Kennedy.

I'm getting around to it.

I know, I know, it's not feminist.

I want to.
I want our kids to have it, too.

Proposition?

It's been a year.

Let's do it, while we're young.

And then when we're in our 40s,

we can drive around
in a big painted van

like the Partridge Family.

Well? Thoughts?

If we know what we want, why wait?

We can have both.

For example, I heard
the new walk-in's not hooked up yet.

Anyone could walk in.

Mm-hmm.

What Candace and I had was
never real. I'm certain of that now.

The way she lies. Effortless.
Like... breathing.

I feel bad for Forty.
He can't resist her Lolita act

any more than I could.

Is she sleeping with him?

Or did she make up some lie
to get out of that, too?

Maybe she's decided it's an acceptable
price to pay to ruin my life.

Or maybe they're in love.

One upside
to Forty's constant online pleas

for validation is it's easy to figure out
where he's gonna be, any given time.

He's on his way now
to play Dungeons & Dragons

at Joe Manganiello's house.

He's been tweeting about it incessantly
for a week.

So what's it gonna be, bunny?

Do we tango here, or...?

Elsewhere it is.

The air feels charged.
Santa Ana winds.

Anyone with a lick of common sense
would get the hell out of this town

before it's too late.

But not us. We had a date with destiny.

I'm reading too much Chandler.

Where is she going in such a hurry?

Is she meeting someone?

That is a cop.

Probably unrelated,
but I can't be too careful.

Shit. Okay, okay. It's possible
I'm the tiniest bit paranoid.

Shit. Candace one, me zero.

- What's up, Ellie?
- Hey.

- What you reading there, Will?
- Oh, uh, Chandler.

Nice one.

You should really watch the film, though.

Robert Mitchum
is my second-favorite Philip Marlowe.

Okay, who's your first?

Just so I know who to picture when
I'm staring at the boring little words.

Oh, Elliott Gould, of course. Sex on legs.

Probably still can get it.

I'm glad to see she's feeling better
after all that happened with Henderson.

Fuck me!

What happened?

I grabbed the fucking curling iron,
thought it was the brush. Ow!

- You okay? Run it under cold water. Here.
- Here you go.

One thing I know. When a traumatized
woman tries to keep it together

when she's actually falling apart,
this happens.

Is that better?

- Ellie, can you get me an ice pack?
- Yeah, um...

I saw you at Henderson's memorial.

Well, this feels like a trap.

- The woman I'm seeing, her brother...
- Love and Forty Quinn?

Yeah, I know who they are.

Forty used to take up permanent residence
in Hendy's anal cavity

before he was ejected
for being a junkie prick,

but far be it for me
to question the company you keep.

- I'm gonna go.
- Maybe, yeah. Just...

go and forget all about it,

just like everybody else is gonna do
after they're done canonizing him.

She's not wrong. Henderson
may have gotten what he deserved,

but in the eyes of the public,
he's a victim, a hero, even.

That's gotta sting.

I'm sorry, Will.

My sister's a little upset,
and she's also a bitch.

I'm taking all of them down.
Beginning with his succubus of an agent,

followed by anybody else
that turned a blind eye.

They're all complicit.

She should see a doctor,
but if I suggest it, she might injure me.

Okay, Jessica Jones,

four ibuprofen and a Xanny.

Take it down a notch, okay?
We'll watch a movie.

It sucks that she has to manage
her sister like this.

Uh, Will? Maybe you wanna join?

Tonight we're gonna be streaming
the 1992 classic

- The Player, starring Tim Robbins...
- We have work to do.

You're a good sister.

I know. So, uh... you in?

- Murder, Hollywood?
- She needs someone right now,

no matter how cool she's acting.

- Candace can wait until tomorrow.
- You got any popcorn?

'Course I do. I'm not an animal.

Oldest of sports.

Is it bisexual pescatarian week
again already?

- Man, time flies.
- What's D-FOL?

Dark Face of Love. The "the" is silent.

We are setting up a temp production office
in the back.

- Who's we?
- Me and Amy.

And you.
Giving you a producer credit, brohamulus.

Forty, I'm not qualified.

You're hilarious.

It's no pay, just points on the back end,

and as much festival poon
as you can schnorf.

He knows
I'm dating his sister, right?

Uh-oh.
Did you not get enough sleep last night?

I was up late.

Okay, well,

still need you to sign
the production contact sheet.

Okay. What's a loan-out?

You can just make something up.
Like, Bettelheim Productions.

Bettelheim Films. Bettel...

That name is really aggressive.

It's not gonna marquee well at all.
We'll brainstorm.

What's Amy's address?
She didn't fill it out. So I can do it.

I know it's in Echo Park.
I wanna say Loma Vista Lane?

I'm not sure what the number is.

That's a start.

All right.

First production meeting is 19:00.

All hands on deck.

Sorry, Fortinbrah,
just made other plans.

Boop!

- Up for a road trip?
- Where to?

Glendora. It is a drive,
but the things that this donut shop does

with fresh strawberries
should be considered a sex crime.

That's intriguing.

Pick me up at six?

Okay. Two hours to get
the tactical advantage I need

to stop Candace. I can make this work.

Only two rentals on Loma Vista Lane,
and one isn't really her speed.

This feels more like Candace.

The Gothic Barbie dream house.

"Historic Victorian home
in Angelino Heights.

Private bathroom, balcony. Tee-pee access.

Rachel is a superhost
with a five-star rating

who recently relocated to Berlin."

Cross-reference Google Maps,

and bingo.

Candace found me, I found her.

Toyota Camry. Same as yesterday.

I should listen to my instincts.
This is bad, Love.

Plainclothes cop?

Henderson? Maybe Will talked?

Jasper's associates got to him in Manila...
No, that's crazy.

Dr. Nicky hired a PI from prison.

What's he got on me?
Oh, no, no no.

This city is fucking endless.

If I can't disappear into all that...

No, Love, I don't want to disappear.

I want to eat donuts,
impress your parents.

Hear my name, my real name, on your lips.

Pack of... No, thank you.

Fucking LA traffic.
I'm so late for you, Love.

Is that the Toyota?

No, no no. Oh, Love.

You're having me followed.

No. There has to be an explanation.

If you're gonna show up an hour late,
you should call.

She's furious,

or the doors are about to fling open
with an army of law enforcement.

It's hard to say.

I'm so sorry.

Hey, I don't do apology assault, Will.

You stood me up,
you'll get to apologize on my time.

Understood.

So far, so weird.

That doesn't look like the face of a woman

who just learned something
unspeakable about her man.

Maybe I should just...

Love...

Is everything okay?

I don't know. You tell me.

When I was walking up just now,
there was a man leaving here.

Yeah, that's Alec Grigoryan.
He's a private detective.

My family's been using him for years.

He was here, why?

Well, I hired him to look into Amy.

- Oh.
- You trust me.

It's Candace you don't trust
because you are smart and true.

- But...
- Why wouldn't you say something?

It's not a big deal
unless he finds something, right?

I think hiring a PI
is actually kind of a big deal.

Not if you're a Quinn.

I can't believe you're being so casual.

I don't know why you're freaking out.
You don't even like her.

Would you ever hire someone to follow me?

I don't know. Why? Should I?

Who are you right now?

The thing is, people take advantage
of people with money.

It's just a fact, okay?

I'm not gonna apologize
for protecting my family.

Ever.

Privilege check, aisle one.

- I just think...
- What?

My parents offered to help.

We can pay them back, and...

Can we talk about this?

You're just detoxing.

I just think...

I'm some spoiled rich girl?

Independent, but always have
a golden parachute if I need it?

- Well, yeah.
- It's not what I meant.

You did.

I'll call Alec tomorrow morning.

Tell him to stop following Amy.

I get how it's too much.

Okay? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for missing our donut pil...

I told you,

don't apologize.

Salmonella?

- You're an idiot.
- Yes.

No secrets, Love. Please.

I really don't do well with secrets.

Barry. Okay, Barry,
don't be such a massive pussy.

Just match Ray.

Don't you want your name
on something relevant?

Something that matters,
something... Exactly.

Yes... Of course I'll tell my dad.

Thank you, Barry. Thank you.

Thank you.

Barry's in the bag.
Put him down for 100K.

Great. I have a hair thing.

Oh, okay.

Bye. Treasure you.

Fucking Barry.

Can I help you?

I'm looking for Will.

Oh, sorry. He's not home right now.

I'm Amy. You are...?

The building manager.

Oh, cool.

I love these old Deco places.

I'm glad Will opted for some charm
and not some soulless condo.

- How do you know Will?
- Friends.

But, you know, it's complicated.

You were at the memorial yesterday,
weren't you?

Yeah. Hence, complicated.

Will and I used to date.

He has a pair of earrings
I've been trying to get back.

- Do you think you could...
- Did you know Henderson?

Forty did.

His comedy really wasn't my speed.

And I don't mean to speak ill of the dead,
but he seemed kind of like a perv.

Oh, you can't actually come in.
It's against the law.

Um, but what do they look like?

Like, dangly little green stones.

Do you have any idea where they might be?

Um...

Nightstand?

Okay, I'll go... I'll go look.

So, are you from Brooklyn, too?

Not originally,
but that's where I met Will.

That's cute. Who followed who?

I'm sorry?

To LA. Did you follow him or him you?

Oh. We were already broken up

so more of a coincidence
that we both ended up here.

Well, I didn't find any earrings.

Um...

Damn it.

All right. I'll hit him up later.
Thank you so much.

Yeah, no problem.

- This is Love.
- Miss Quinn.

- Alec Grigoryan.
- Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

I've decided
I want to call off the investigation.

You can charge me for the whole day.

Well, I think you're gonna wanna see
what I found.

Can you meet?

Now that you've called off the dogs,

I can get back to the work
of getting Candace away from us.

- Hey, Casanova.
- I'm gonna keep walking, Ellie.

I'm just impressed.

Our little Will caught the eye
of heiress Love Quinn

and is sneaking around
with a secret ex-girl.

Did not think you had that much game.

Ex-girl?

I appreciate how you're not racist
towards gingers.

Ginger? What are you talking about?

Came by looking for earrings. Come on.

- That's, like, gotta be code for...
- Candace, here.

Listen to me. That woman, she's...

She's what?

- What?
- She's no one.

- You are so lying to me right now.
- Go home.

Hey, just because you're dripping
in hoo-ha doesn't mean you're all that!

Asshole.

Candace coming here crosses a line.
I need a new plan.

If you think about it,
she's already living on borrowed time.

She resurrected
like some sort of ginger vampire

to suck my life away.

Dealing with her is nothing
but balancing the cosmic scales.

It's not safe, her walking around free.

She's dangerous, not just to me.
To your brother. To you.

Night off. That works.

Seems bunny's home.

"Rope bondage." "Tight binding."
"Krav Maga"?

Candace!

Untie me, you... bitch!

- I'm sorry,
- Oh!

- what did you call me?
- Ah!

Not Candace. What?

Hi.

I... I just... I...

Just save your lies for the cops.

No, this is...
this is not what it looks like.

Oh, really?

Candace Stone?

You're not a film financier.
You're a waitress, barely.

Spent a good few weeks
in a mental hospital last year.

You have no money, no family,
no permanent address.

And so you tried to con us.

- Wouldn't be the first time.
- Love, okay, please...

The one thing I still don't understand
is what you want with Will.

His name's not Will.

- Jesus Christ, what...
- It's Joe Goldberg.

He's my ex-boyfriend.

I know this sounds crazy,
but I am telling you the truth.

He attacked me and almost killed me.

- He what?
- Yes. And he killed the girl after me.

Is this some kind of joke?

I... I wish it was.

I only came here to protect you.

Before you went to Austin
to date my brother or after?

No, to protect all of you.

But especially you.

If he loves you,

that's the most dangerous thing.

Take a look inside.

Now, bitch, what's your name?

Will.

Why did you break into my home, Will?

I didn't break in.

- I was just...
- Don't lie to me.

I learnt Krav Maga.

And I'm not afraid to use it.

Iâve made mistakes, but, oh my,
is this a new first prize?

The door was open.

Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

I'm sorry.

- I asked you a question.
- Please.

Come on, Will. Consent 101.

Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

No, no. No, it's not.

Who knows
how to tie people up like this?

This woman is clearly
some kind of perverted sex worker.

Not that I'm judging.

- Think.
- Think.

Who's Candace?

Amy... Adam. That's why I'm here.

I see.

And you were going to...

That's... that's...

That's not what it looks like.

I was supposed to creep in
and surprise her.

In bed. She wanted me to tie her up.

- And, you know, it... This is...
- You're telling me

this is some kind of scene you negotiated?

We're both really vanilla, I admit.

But she keeps asking,
and I wanna be more GGG.

This is not the first time
she has flaked on me.

This is the first time I have been beaten
and tied up for it, though.

Jesus. You poor, pathetic boy.
You went to Home Depot.

Can I give you a piece of advice?

Um, maybe untie me first?

Don't try so hard. This isn't you.

You're not rape fantasy guy.

I'm not.
Not even a little bit.

You're demeaning yourself, man.
Let me tell you something about Amy.

She's hardly been here
since she rented my room.

- I can hardly feel my hands.
- I know the type.

Come to LA with stars in their eyes,

but few, if any,
have the talent to make it.

So they starfuck.

You know, she's dating some douche-canoe
with a stupid name.

Forbes? Francis?

Idiot.

Mm-hmm.

A lot of men in LA should just be taken
out of the gene pool.

Murdered by an unhinged dominatrix.

Remember me, Love.

I'm inclined to untie you.

But you try anything stupid,

and I throat punch you
with my Louboutin, dig?

Yes.

Yes, I dig. I dig.

Ah.

Call yourself a Lyft, sweetie,
and get the fuck out of my house.

Candace two, me zero. Damn it.

It smells amazing.

It's a new recipe.

Taste?

That... It tastes...

Like shit?

- I'm sorry. It's... it's salty.
- Yeah.

It's 'cause I used salt instead of sugar.

Sucks being lied to, huh?

What is this?

Open it.

Truth time.

Tell me it isn't you.

It's me.

Is your name Will Bettelheim?

My name is Joe.

Joe Goldberg.

- And Amy...
- Is Candace Stone. I know. I...

Why did she tell me
that you buried her alive?

- That's what she believes.
- Yeah, well, she also believes...

that you killed a woman,
and that you're basically Dexter.

Candace Stone is crazy.

Clearly!

But there also must be some grain of truth
because you look so pale right now.

So just tell me.

I can find out.

Anything. Right?

Unlimited resources.

Okay. Can...

Candace is the reason I left New York.

She's obsessed with me.

She destroyed friendships, relationships.

- I had to leave my job.
- Okay.

Say you're right. She's nuts.

What about the other girl?

Guinevere Beck.
The Dark Face of Love herself.

Yeah, that was tragic.

But we went out on one date.

My main takeaway

is she posted a photo of us
to make her actual boyfriend jealous.

I never saw her,

until months later
I heard she passed away.

You tell me how Candace knows
about that at all.

Why do you think I had no social media?

Why do you think I changed my name?

I wanted to disappear,
and she followed me.

I just wanted to be free.

And then I met you.

Love, I am so sorry I lied.

Why didnât you tell me...

the moment that she showed up with Forty?

I was terrified.

Well, I sent her away.

With a few threats, a lot of money.

So sheâs gone for real.

But fuck, Will.

Joe?

I don't even know
what I'm supposed to call you now.

Call me whatever you want.

Call me Will. You can call me Joe.

You can call me that fucking liar.

Call me in the middle of the night.

Call me happy, sad, sick,

for favors,

for sex, for a laugh,

a cry...

Donât ever stop calling me.

I have never loved anyone
like this before.

Me neither.

Which is what makes this so hard.

It's over.

How long have you um...

How long have you known?

Youâve been keeping this from me
for two months?

You lied.

Why?

How am I...?

You can't. You can't. You can't.

You can't be sick.

It would be easy
to blame Candace for this,

and I do, but I blame myself too.

I broke my own rule.

But what is life without Love?

I guess I'm gonna find out.

Well, if it isnât Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Douchebag.

I came by to drop off my badge
and my apron.

You donât have to quit.

I do, Forty.

Actually... you don't.

Look, Love told me everything,

and while we agreed
that you are a lying ball sack,

we also agreed

that you probably donât need
to be punished twice.

So just, like, stay out of her airspace
for a while. Okay?

Are you saying I should stay?

For now.

I went to bat for you.

Why?

Because it's nice having you around.

Youâre real.

You did lie about your identity,

but you are still more authentic

than half the fuckers I know.

Thanks, man.

If being Fortyâs bitch
means I get to stay in your orbit,

sign me up.

Like I said, heâs not a bad guy.

Youâre not one
of those self-loathing Jews, are you?

- Spoke too soon.
- What?

Joe Goldberg.

Great name for a producer.

Will Bettelheim...

made you sound like a Nazi, so...

Thank you for giving me another chance.

And thank Love for me, too.

Land of second chances, am I right?

This can work.

Iâll just go back to loving you
from a distance.

Lifeâs a divine comedy.
A tale told by an idiot.

A sadistic idiot.

Speaking of sadists,

Iâd endure a ten-hour session with Rachel

for just five more minutes
of you not hating me.

Please do something.

Hey, Delilah?

What?

Itâs worse than I thought.

Howâs it going?

Hmm. How's it going? Um...

This town enables rapists.

You mind if I take a look?

Wow. This is quite a whoâs who.

Oh!

Oh, look, I made the cut.

Donât touch, please. Don't touch.

Iâd be worried,
but half of Hollywood is up there,

including Johnny Carson,

who Iâm pretty sure has been dead
for years.

This is a lot, Delilah.

You don't think I know that?

Iâm trying to topple the patriarchy

from my two-bedroom apartment,

and it is, one, impossible,
and, two, deranged,

and I just...
I just want somebody to hurt...

like I'm hurting.

Is... Is this okay?

Oh, look at you, asking for consent,
very fucking woke. Gold star.

Iâm sorry he hurt you.

Palo santo and synthetic watermelon.

Odd combo, but it works.
Wise and irreverent, like her.

Will...

Sheâs not in her right mind,
and neither am I.

This is bad.

So why doesnât it feel bad?

Okay, wait. You're upset.
Maybe we shouldnât...

I just want to feel good again.

Me too.

She needed someone.

I suppose it's the least I could do.

This whole thing that you're doing...

Is a lot.

And I have ten unpleasant phone calls
I need to get to, so...

- Maybe you should just go.
- Yeah, okay...

So, I have a thought aboutthat.

Oh?

Chasing this story...

You know the story already.
It's... it's your story.

- Are you saying...?
- I'm saying...

you go after the whole town
if you want,

but what if you tell your story?
Think about how powerful that would be.

It might encourage others to do the same.
You wouldnât have to chase them down.

They would follow your example
and come forward.

Did you just mansplain
and patronize me in the same sentence?

Thanks for the D, Will. Bye.

I gotta get out of this town, Love.

Can you believe this?

Seven totems.

And once you find all of them,
you are officially an Angeleno.

...and can never leave.

Starlets in matching dresses.
Dog in a stroller.

Off-brand superhero.
Rollerblader in booty-shorts. Cop chopper.

Pack of coyotes.

And the burning palm tree.

As Raymond Chandler said,

"There is no trap so deadly
as the trap you set for yourself."

Maybe Iâll stick around for a while,
push my luck.

One thingâs for sure,

you canât beat the donuts.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

It's weird,

the things you do
when you're broken up with.

I considered stepping
in front of a car the other day

just so you'd look at me.

I know, I should run.

Candace could storm in
with a SWAT team at any moment,

and, honestly, it would be a convenience.

Everything hurts,
and nothing is okay without you, Love.

You... don't make it easy to check in.

I'm shut out, and you want me to know it.

I just want to know you're okay, Love.

And, maybe, to know you're hurting too.

Goddamn curtains.

I...

What the...?

Who the fuck is that?

There are a lot of seedy characters
in this town, Love.

It's a good thing you moved
your spare key to... to the bird house!

Shit. Shit.

If I go over there,
you'll know I was watching.

If I don't... Oh, damn it.

I get it now.

The curtains aren't to shut me out.

They're a kindness
because you've already moved on.

Okay.

Not so long ago,

that was me,
with your fingers in my mouth.

Me, eating your delicious cooking.

Me, tasting the food in your mouth

when you couldn't wait
till after you'd swallowed to kiss me.

Didn't think you were one for pretty boys.

Could you really be
into all those muscles?

Who is this monster?

That...

is Milo.

It's not really my business.

- Milo. Milo what?
- Milo fucking Warrington.

You know,
he used to be James's best friend.

Love's late husband James?

Exactly.

He just spent two years traversing Asia

so he could sprinkle James's ashes
all over the Himalayas.

And now he's back,

traversing Love's vagina. Again.

'Cause he does that periodically.

- So he's a...
- Scumbag.

I would Poltergeist the shit out of him
if I was James.

I need answers, Love.

Well, maybe it's a comfort thing.

I mean, they've both been
through something terrible.

Yeah.

Maybe for her, it is.

But he's been sweet on her since college.

He could not stand it
when she chose James.

And then guess who was Mr. Attentive
at the funeral?

Yeah. He stayed for weeks after.

Cooked, cleaned, bathed her,

went down on her every night.

Nobody does that shit out
of the kindness of their own heart, Joe.

He was preying on her

when she was vulnerable.

And now he's doing it again.

Picking up the pieces
when your body's barely cold.

He's a predator,
and you're falling for it, Love.

Don't worry, sport,
she's not falling for it.

Love will give herself permission to do
what she needs to do to heal,

but she is still very broken up over you.

She does not look very broken up.

Challenge accepted.

Watch this.

Milo Warrington,

Australian Zen Buddhist travel blogger

with a penchant for holding baby animals
with his shirt off.

Sponsored by Patagonia,

which is easier
when your dad owns Patagonia.

He free-climbs, plays guitar,
trains horses,

volunteers in third-world countries?

No, he's too perfect. No guy like this
actually exists outside a romance novel.

I smell a fraud.

And you look too enchanted, Love.

What's up?

Really? Bringing Mr. Didgeridon't
around just for Joe to see?

It's all a little Dottie of you.

You cannot possibly be into him.

Okay, first of all, never compare me
to Mom again.

And secondly, I'm actually into him.

No, this is good for me.

And I don't need you coming in
on behalf of Will,

or... Joe,
or whatever the fuck his name is,

trying to make me feel
some type of way about it, okay?

Milo is good. At least he's honest.

Is he, though?

Do me a favor.
Focus on your own shit, okay?

Move to the light, as Dottie would say.

- Hey, Forty.
- Hi, Salami Nips.

As I suspected, she is not over you.

- Did she say that?
- She did not need to.

This is what Love does when she's hurting.

She, like, gets a little basic

and pretends to like things
that she definitely does not like

in order to seem normal.

And also, it's the only time
that she'll snap at me. It's a tell.

Makes sense.

When I was getting over Beck,
I glommed onto Karen Minty.

Good, but wrong for me.

Is that who Milo is? Is he your Karen?

Okay, so you know
what you have to do now, right?

Get back on the horse,
start dating around,

show Love how free
and happy you're living.

She will hate that.

I'm not the vindictive type.

And she's not really the jealous type.

Oh! I'm sorry,
did the two of you share a womb?

Yeah, trust me, okay? She gets jealous.

Now let's set you up.

Forty.

Why are you helping me?
I lied to your sister.

I lied to you.

I tangled you up in this...
this Amy-Candace mess.

Hey. As Shakespeare once said,

"Bitcheth was crazy."

You lied out of necessity. Okay?

That guy is a pie-hunting snake

in Tarzan's body,
and I do not trust him.

My gut says you're good,

he's bad, case dismissed.

I'm starting to see what you see
in Forty. He is smart.

And he loves you hard. I get that.

All right. I need something good
for your Flingr profile.

Spit me some literature, please.

Flingr?

You are not putting this poor,
innocent man on there.

I suggest Magnolia.

It's mostly queer,

but straight girls troll
for gays to beard,

- and they are aggressive as fuck.
- Oh.

I know it's a deeper conversation,
but I'm just saying,

- I could have all the pussy I could...
- Eat.

Eat... or whatever.
So, by all means, you take it.

Goldleaf is another good one.

It's only for celebrities,
so we would need to get you verified,

but, uh, it's safer for people like us.

You up on the lingo?

"PnP," whatnot?

"Party and play," a.k.a. drugs and sex?

Oh! If someone hits you
with a "What's up," capital T,

that means "Tina," which means meth.

- Why is Tina meth?
- Oh, and you definitely need to watch

for kitten-fishing thirst traps.

- What?
- Pictures.

Like, if it's a close-up head shot,
she's fat.

If it's a group shot, she's, like,
really insecure,

but, like, wants to seem fun.
And if she has a pixie cut...

- Oh, and...
- Okay.

Thank you both. Wow.
That's a lot to think about.

And I will.

Thoughts?

Chum in the water.

You know, I gotta hand it to this
guy, he takes a gorgeous picture.

Not that it's difficult

when the subject is you.

Uh, what was that?
No. Did I just like his photo of you?

- Son of a...
- Hey, creep.

- Hey.
- Do me a favor.

Instead of Delilah,
fuck anything else. Cool?

How... Why do you know about that?

Just be a normal person

and rebound on Flingr
instead of your literal neighbor.

- Can you do that?
- Elle?

Can you scrounge up some more quarters?
We need three more.

Fine.

But if I come back
and witness anything nasty,

I'm running away forever.

- Hi.
- Apartment three.

- Delilah, I'm sorry, I...
- Stop, it's no big deal. Okay?

You can stop avoiding me

and pay your fucking rent
because it's late.

- That's right. I'm sorry.
- And stop apologizing.

Okay.

But, hey, Flingr is a great idea

because you clearly need some training
on how to be a single human man in LA.

Noted.

What's that,
four people now suggesting Flingr?

Do I smell desperate?

Maybe I do.

Bye, creep.

Here are your quarters.

Why do you hate Will?

I mean, he's grumpy, and I give him shit
'cause I kinda hate him,

- but, I don't...
- I don't hate him.

Ever think maybe it's because I like him,
I don't want things to blow up?

Which you know will happen.

Then he'll have to move,
or we'll have to move, and it just...

Can't things just be simple for once?

Fair enough.

"Ten Dating Apps
for Those Who Hate Dating Apps."

And the profiles of several
rather promiscuous-looking ladies.

Out of pure, morbid curiosity.

I know these apps are helpful

and there are success stories,

but how lazy and anti-feminist is this?

Swipe yes or no based off of a glance

at a retouched selfie? It's barbaric.

Bring me the days
when a man would ride horseback

for hours just to sit beside a woman

for tea, without the promise
of a graze of a single finger.

Some of the pictures
don't even have faces in it.

And what the hell is "cuffing season"?

"Sonnet2Me."

Hmm. "The App for Readers.

Less photo-based, more conversational.

For those interested in getting to know
someone who actually reads."

Mmm, okay. I'll bite.

What's in a name, indeed.

Oh, the saga
of Will Bettelheim must continue.

Joe and his heart are reserved
for one person.

Are you really the jealous type, Love?

I guess we'll see.

What are your favorite books?

Total honesty, I'm not the biggest reader.

I just really want to date a guy who is.

4-Hour Workweek changed my life.
You should read it.

Anything Tolstoy.

And Bukowski.

Bit of a romantic.

What's your story?

- I moved here a few months ago.
- For the industry?

Me too!

From where? What are your goals?

Any fetishes I should know about?

"But you can't get away from yourself,

moving from one place to another."

That's... The Sun Also Rises.

You know your Hemingway.

It's very sexy.

I couldn't agree more.

Uh, cheers.

Higher.

It's in portrait mode, right?

I'll get the room. You walk in two steps,

get on your knees, we fuck,
you leave, no talking.

- Um...
- "If you think it long...

and mad..."

Take some on your phone.
Your camera might be better.

"I shall lift my arms,

and my roots shall set off
to seek another land."

Let's get you an Uber home.

Thanks to Forty's constant reposts

to his Stories, I can see you've been
looking at my profile, Love,

but choosing not to engage.

Now that's a sign, right? You're jealous.

Oh, my God.

- You went all the way to Glendora?
- Yeah, of course.

Meanwhile, Milo's account
is getting more and more intimate.

And now you're eating sex crime donuts
with him and not me.

- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

- What are you doing?
- I'm... I'm just reorganizing. Per Forty.

Is that the garbage?

- Yeah.
- Oh. I got it.

- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm already back here.

Okay, thanks.

What did you want to talk to me about?

Well, as you know, I go to Bali next week,

and I should be there
for about ten months.

Mm-hmm?

Yeah, you said you were really excited.

This is the moment he asks
you to come.

He's trying to Peach you,

- and I have the pleasure of hearing it.
- Well,

not anymore.

I'm tired of traveling.
And this,

you and me,
has been really good, hasn't it?

- Oh, no.
- Yeah, it's great.

Right. So, I'm thinking,

what if I stick around a while?

What if you and me give this a real shot?

I want you to be my girlfriend, Love.

I'm sorry...

Just a little dry.

Wow.

Milo, that's, um...

I don't want you to make that decision
because of me.

But if staying in LA feels right, then...

you should.

Okay.

So, the big guy is sticking around
like a stupid fucking boomerang.

Do you want to be his girlfriend, Love?

Enjoy. I hear the beaches
in Manila are beautiful.

Hey.

Hey.

I heard you're... online dating.

Forty told me twice

- or, like, 100 times.
- Yeah.

- He's very supportive, I guess.
- It's going well?

You are curious.

It is, actually. Yeah, I mean, it's all...

That's really great.

I'm glad
you're putting yourself out there.

I was just also curious.
What name are you using? Will or Joe?

Love.

Will.

Interesting.

Forty was wrong.

You aren't jealous. You are disgusted.

And I don't blame you.

While I've been on a fool's errand
of pointless dates,

Milo has leveled up,
and you are falling for it.

I think I've been putting my attention
in the wrong place.

Is it the Avengers bod?

Or the "born into old money
but went the New-Age route" thing?

Oh, is it the sex?

Damn. This is really uphill.

Is it his lung capacity, Love?

- Will?
- Shit.

Of course, your best friend, now.

Gabe! Man, what...

That's crazy. I just saw, um, Milo.
He, you know, he's...

It's a coincidence. I guess he's hiking.
Everybody's hiking today.

- You hike often?
- Uh...

I'm getting into it, yeah.

Will, I have
an especially potent bullshit detector.

You mind if we just sidestep
these forced niceties?

Stop the little white lies.

Love values radical,
it-hurts-even-to-say-it honesty

above anything else.

And she caught you in a fucking whopper.

I know.

- I know...
- That being said,

in almost ten years of our friendship,

I don't think she has ever talked
about someone

the way that she has talked about you.

Not even James.

So I think there's still hope.

But this whole Flingr-whore,
jealous stalker thing,

it is not a good look.

You wanna know
why Love is so attracted to Milo?

- Yes.
- He worked on himself.

Damage attracts damage.
Healthy people like healthy people.

- What if I'm damaged?
- Honey...

everybody came here because they are.

The point is what you do with it.

Maybe it's time you faced this
like a true Angeleno, hmm?

Terrified to know what this means.

Come along.

How are you feeling?

Crazy.

Nervous.

What are you afraid of?

That one of these will graze a
nerve, and I'll become Sloth from Goonies.

Um...

I don't know.

Ow.

What are you afraid of?

I don't know, I'm afraid this won't work.

That is what you thought I wanted to hear.

What are you afraid of?

Okay. Breathe.

Think. Answer honestly
because your psycho friend Gabe

is a human lie detector.

I'm afraid...

this will work.

And?

I'll say something... true.

Something bad.

You'll tell Love.

And I'll lose her forever.

What is in these needles?

The truth does not scare Love.

This would.

Love, your friend is a sorcerer.

So, you believe your truth...

makes you unworthy of love?

I need to stop talking now.

Yes.

And, therefore, unworthy of Love.

Yes.

- Mommy?
- Joe.

Baby.

- Get in here.
- I was afraid you left.

I'm so sorry.

What's happening?

My home is you.

Who would you be
if you didn't have anyone to love?

Joey, you're such a good boy.

What did you lose...

that makes you chase love so much?

Today's the day.

We're getting out of here.

Where are we going?

I don't know yet.

But we're never gonna see him again. Okay?

I'm sorry I did this to you.

I thought he'd be better this time,

but he was worse.

We're done.

We're out.

- What are we?
- Out.

That's right. Pack your stuff.

Take only the important things,
none of those books.

You hear me?

Okay, you can take one.

I'm gonna go to the bank,
and I'll be back at four to get you.

And it'll be just the two of us.

As long as we're together,

we'll always be home.

You have been in the pursuit of someone
to love and care for for all of your life.

What if...

you were that person?

What if you're all that you need?

Say it with me, "I...

- I...
- ...am all I need."

...am all I need.

Again.

I am all I need.

How are you feeling?

Free.

Full.

It's the power of self-love.

As Mama Ru says,

"If you cannot love yourself,

how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?"

Hm.

Okay, easy.

Easy now. You're gonna feel
a little out-of-body for a while.

All right?

You're a wizard.

Thank you.

But this is not a cure-all.

It's a practice.

You're still gonna experience
dark thoughts and emotions.

What is important
is that you follow it up with,

"And I'm okay with that."

"I'm okay with that."

Good. Good, good.

It's also important
you keep that temple clean, okay?

I'm gonna suggest
a quick seven-day cleanse.

Eew!

Dude, I love green juice,
but celery is basically Satan's butt plug.

It's not that bad.

Oh, I can't look at you
while you drink that.

But we do need to chat, re: D-FOL.

We gotta find a big name to play Beck.
Or maybe...

we take the auditions on the road.
Like, look for our Scarlett O'Hara.

Do you have any thoughts?

It's kind of nice how Forty
sabotages his own process so much.

It takes it out of my hands entirely.

Shouldn't we write a script first?

What you writing?

Ellie, what are you doing here?

Checking in to see
how the dating world's treating you.

Being neighborly.

I don't buy it.

Celery juice?

Ugh, what is wrong with you?

This kid knows what's up.

He's on a juice cleanse,
trying to fix himself, win back my sister.

Flingr was a bust, huh?

The kid is Ellie Alves, by the way.

Read in the trades you acquired
a pretty big piece of IP, Forty Quinn.

Trades?

Yeah,
I had my agent put out a press release.

Shit. Fuck. Damn it, Forty.

If you need any help with development,
I'm really good with coverage and notes.

And there's the real reason
she's here. Little opportunist.

- What are you, 12?
- I'm almost 16,

and I can guarantee you
I know more about film

than any idiot assistant
to come out of WME.

- Oh, here we go.
- All right, Hermione,

who was originally supposed to play
the Terminator?

OJ Simpson, but James Cameron thought
he looked too nice to play a killer.

What's the longest narrative film shoot
in history?

- Boyhood, 12 years.
- Not even close.

The Thief and the Cobbler, 29 years.

- Doesn't count. It's not live-action.
- Not what I asked.

Okay.

Okay.

What say you, sport?
Should we hire ourselves an intern?

Well, Forty's no Henderson.

And Little Miss Ballsy
is bound to find opportunity elsewhere.

Probably with less honorable people.

The devil you know, right?

Fine.

After homework,

limited hours,
only with Delilah's written permission.

Okay, Dad.

Beautiful and artful,
though a bit of a violation.

Because I know
you would've never consented to this.

Uh, not my business.

If you want to be with someone
who posts intimate pictures

without your knowledge for millions
to enjoy, it's your choice, Love.

And I'm okay with that.

- Hey.
- Hey.

So, remember how you mansplained to me
that I should write my Henderson story?

Vividly.

Am I sweating? Why am I sweating?

Well, I'm not saying I did it,

but if I had written it and submitted it,

I might have gotten confirmation
that it's gonna be published

in Variety fucking magazine.

Holy shit, Delilah! That's so great.

Let's be clear, though,
this is not a thank-you.

I will never thank you. Clear?

- So...
- What is happening here?

Yeah. So clear.

What is happening here? Are you...

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. That is so good.

Mmm.

It's Meyer lemon and plum curd
and Italian buttercream.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

My favorite so far.

You've said that
about all of them.

And I meant it every time.

Sunrise and Lucy will be stoked
with any of these, babe.

You're...

incredible.

Thanks.

But if you call me "babe" again,
I'm gonna stick you in the oven.

So...

I found a place.

Little bungalow in Atwater.

Close enough I can jog to you,
but not so close it's clingy.

- What about...
- I canceled Bali.

You said if it felt right for me to stay,
then I should.

And... this feels right.

I want to see where this goes.

Milo, I care about you a lot.

And this has been great.

I just...

I like the way things are.

I'm not sure
I'm ready to change the dynamic.

The dynamic where you call me
when you need to get over another guy?

Yes. But it's not just that.

You, more than anyone,
know that I am a package deal.

Forty...

he needs me.

He's working on this film, which,
quite frankly, is bound to fail

because they all do.

And when he does, he'll implode.

I can feel it.

It's just like the earthquake.
We all know the big one is coming.

- He's a grown man, Love.
- But he's not, really.

One thing I love is your honesty.

Maybe it's time to get honest
with how codependent you are with him.

Hey, look.

I'm... falling in love with you.

And it's okay if you're not there yet.

I can wait.

Just... let me.

Please.

Will? Will, wake up.

Oh!

What happened?

You Exorcist-vomited
all over my favorite top

and then passed out.

Oh.

Same thing happened to me
a couple years ago

when I read that celery
was negative calories.

I ate nothing else for three days

and then projectile barfed
all over my own birthday cake.

- Oh.
- Enough of this juice shit.

I'm ordering burgers and shakes.

So?

Ugh.

It's hard to read.

But I still couldn't put it down.

It's incredible.

Well, don't sound so surprised.

It's weird
how powerful vulnerability can feel.

I don't think I would've had the guts
if you hadn't angered me into it.

Still not a thank-you.

You know you can always count on me
to say the wrong thing.

If I told you I was proud,
would you want to hurt me?

- Probably.
- Okay.

- Yeah.
- Well.

I'm definitely not proud of you.

So... did you really think you
were gonna juice your way

back into Love Quinn's heart?

Wasn't about her.

Not really.

What? You trying to reach
your goal weight?

Just want to clear the noise.

Did it work?

I don't know.

Maybe I'm cynical, but I...

really don't think any of that stuff works
for anyone who's truly broken.

Serves us better
to just keep barreling forward

and hope the demons can't keep up.

So...

might as well be who you are.

This is not outrunning demons.

This is slaying them.

- No thanks to you.
- Zero thanks to me.

Nice to meet the real you, Delilah.

You're really quite beautiful.

Oh, no.

This is good.

Everything's better with a little whiskey.

In fact,

this night could do
with a little bit more.

You up for a walk?

My first impression of you was...

weirdo.

Oh, come on, you can't be surprised.

- You had no social media.
- Oh!

You show up with a backpack, all New York.

Most people show up
like overeager labradoodles.

I couldn't pull shit out of you.

Almost like you were purposely trying
to have no personality whatsoever.

Ow!

In vino veritas.

Hey, you asked for it.

Okay, my turn.

What was your first impression of me?

Be honest.

- Definitely do not be honest.
- I thought you seemed nice.

Okay, you're such a liar.

Why don't you wash your mouth out,
try again. Veritas.

Oh, well, here goes.

I thought you seemed sad.

I could see how much you had
on your shoulders.

It's a lot.

Also, I have this bad habit
of trying to fix people.

Thus, the unfriendly New Yorker.
So I'm sorry about that.

Hey...

Stop apologizing.

You still think I'm a weirdo?

I mean, I always trust first impressions.

Thing is,

I like weirdos.

Damaged finds damaged.

Every time.

Fuck me.

David Fincher.

Come on. He's a personal friend.

Can we just get him in here,

so we don't have to do
the whole phone call thing?

No? Okay.

What if they take fingerprints?
What if they take DNA?

Not like there's a crusty jar of piss
in Peach Salinger's house or anything.

Guard's playing deaf and dumb.
It was worth a try, though.

What a night, huh?

How long do you think they'll keep us
in here?

I don't know.
I think it's like a six-hour hold.

And then they take our fingerprints
and shit.

Shit, shit, shit.

Are you okay?

- I just...
- Benji, Peach, Beck, Jasper, Hendy.

...don't like confined spaces.

Okay. Well, don't worry.

I got this.

Is this really your first time
being arrested?

Is it not yours?

Delilah.

Fincher, thank God!

Really?

Can you get us out of here?
It was just a big misunderstanding.

We were barely tipsy.
We weren't even driving...

I heard why they brought you in.

That doesn't sound

- like a misunderstanding to me.
- Finch.

You need a lawyer.

I'm sorry, but, uh...

I can't help you.

Will, you know anybody with pull
who isn't a jealous fuck?

It's no problem, sport.
I have a guy for these things.

Just sit tight. Oh, and, hey...

I'm so proud of you.

Oh, my God. In an alley.

Bettelheim. Alves.
You're next for processing.

Fab.

Mexico's only a few hours away.

I could start there.
Will did say I'd like it. Then go south.

Keep going.

There you go.

All right, let's go, D.

You and your friend are free to go.

Apparently,
you have some pretty powerful friends,

William Bettelheim.

Thank you, Officer.

Wait, I know you.

Yeah, he's my neighbor.

You've probably seen him
around the building.

Thanks for your help.

Is that it?

If not, I know where to find you.

Well, the sun's already up.

It's beautiful.

I actually have to get to work,

but thank you

for a night I will not soon forget.

Yeah, that was fun.

Should probs stick to friendship
from now on, though.

For Ellie.

Friends?

You're such an idiot.

Are you guys fucking kidding me?

Elle, I...

You left me alone all night
so you could get laid?

Why do you have to be such a slut?

Friends.

Indecent exposure.

It's a really good title for something.
It kind of rolls off the tongue.

Indecent exposure.

I'm not telling you anything.

How lewd... conduct.

Hey, gents.

Salami.

You don't like surprises.
And you hate roses.

She hates roses.

It's like he's not even trying,

and yet, somehow he still tries too hard.

- Later, fellas.
- Bye, Vagemite.

Oh, hey,

really looking forward
to your next failed attempt

to lock down my sister.

I'm loving the enthusiasm.

Don't do it.

Forty...

I know it's not easy for you
when Love's attention's on someone else.

But I'm gonna be around,
so it'd be nice if we could be cordial

like adults.

Your sister and I are happy.

And it'd nice if you could be happy
for her, too. Huh, champ?

Shit.

Interesting. See, the way that I see it,

you're not gonna be around long, at all.

'Cause you're a Neanderthal.

Wow, when are you gonna grow up?

When are you gonna realize that
natural deodorant is not working for you?

Guys, letâs take it down.

Whatâs going on?

You're the reason why Love
canât do anything good with her life.

Youâre a fucking albatross
around her neck.

- Milo...
- I wonder what James,

your best friend, is thinking,
sitting up in heaven,

watching you fingerbang his wife
'cause you canât keep your dick hard.

Hey!

Oh, my God. Forty.

Thatâs enough.

Get the fuck out, Milo!

He started it!

- Oh, grow up!
- Me?

Iâve been biting my tongue
for a long time.

But maybe if you paid less attention
to your idiot brother,

and more attention to whatâs actually
in front of you,

you might've noticed sooner
that James was sick.

She said get out.

Yeah? What are you gonna do?

Be a big man?

Hope she takes you back?

What?

I remembered
where I knew your friend from.

Great. Bye.

Stopped him for jaywalking,
right outside your place.

Pulled some limited-edition headphones
off him.

Really? You were that cop?

He was throwing them away, D.

William Bettelheim
drives a beater Honda Civic

and makes $12 an hour working
at a grocery store.

Those headphones alone cost
more than he makes in a week.

You ran a background check, Finch?
What the hell is wrong with you?

Listen, Delilah, that was the same night
that Henderson was murdered.

Whatâs a guy with no real money,
no assets doing,

getting rid of $600 headphones

at 4:00 a.m.
the same night a celebrity was killed?

The same celebrity

who is the spokesperson
for those fucking headphones?

Okay, just stop, Alex Jones.

Look, I know you didnât like seeing me
with another dude,

but this look is not cute.

If you wanna be exclusive,

you can ask me out on a real date,
and then weâll talk.

But Iâm not entertaining your ego anymore.
Goodbye.

No, D.

Doesnât mean anything.

My skirt was pulled up.

So youâre saying Henderson...

- Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.
- How much did you pay Will to follow me?

Just wanted to make sure you got
that envelope on your doorstep.

- How did you know about that?
- This is quite a who's who.

- Oh, look, I made the cut.
- Apparently,

you have some pretty powerful friends,

William Bettelheim.

Thereâs no way.

You see? Nothing.

All right.

Hey.

That was the most disgusting display
of toxic masculinity.

Okay, I don't need you, or you,
or anybody to defend me,

or my honor, or whatever you think
makes you entitled

- to do what you just did.
- Okay.

Miss "Sic the PI on my Girlfriend
for My Protection,"

retract the claws,
lest you scratch yourself with hypocrisy.

Yeah. Weâre all a bunch of assholes.

Yeah, youâre right. It wasnât our place.

Iâm sorry.

I'm sorry too.

We just...
We love you too much. Donât we, sport?

Always.

I should get going. I have dinner plans.

Another date?

It's just dinner with a friend.

Hey.

Youâre a good friend...

Joe.

My name.

My real name in your mouth is like poetry.

No matter what happens,

no matter how much self-work I do,

a part of me will always miss the home
that is you.

And Iâm okay with that, Love.

What in the actual... fuck?

Holy shit, perv!

Ew.

Oh.

Hey, Finch, itâs me. Uh...

Just call me back.

I got a nanny cam

in my apartment
when my crazy ex... broke in.

I was gonna ask
if you wanted to have dinner tonight.

Until I saw youâd already been by.

And found some keys.

Give me the phone.

Donât make me take it.

What are you gonna do?

I will scream.

It's soundproof.

Just think about Ellie.

She will be alone.

Hey, booger.

This is Dale.

Say hi.

Come on. Get in the car.

Your dad will be home any minute.

You said it would just be us.

How exactly did you think
that was gonna happen?

Come on. I donât have time for this.
Get in, Joey.

Get in the car.

No.

Oh, no, no, no.

No, no, no!

Don't panic.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

I would never do anything
to hurt you or Ellie.

Will, please, do not leave me in here!

I just need to make some arrangements,
and you will never see me again.

I promise you and Ellie will be fine.

Together.

I just need you to trust me.

Can you trust me, Delilah?

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

Please let me out!

Ellie needs me.

I know she does.

I won't say a word.

Okay? Fuck Henderson.

You think I ever shed a tear
over that asshole?

And... and whatever this...
human aquarium thing is,

I will not tell a soul.

I want to believe you, Delilah.

You don't have to worry. I'm not stupid.

Oh, far from it.

I want your story to end like Will's,
but you are a jaded gossip columnist

with a cop for a fuckbuddy.

- Did you tell him you found this?
- No.

No. I was going to,

but I didn't,
and now I'm definitely not going to.

You want to prove I can trust you?

Delilah.

- H-Hey.
- D!

Finally. What is going on?

Um...

I heard Ben got another DUI. Uh...

Can you confirm?

That's what's so important right now?

Girl's gotta pay rent. So?

Yeah.

But... you didn't hear that from me.

- Okay, thanks. Bye.
- No, hang on.

Hang on, um...

I've been thinking about
what you said, and, um...

I want to take you out. Like, a real date.

Are... are you free tonight?

I can't tonight.

Um, but soon. Yeah, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

Yeah. All right.

You said prove it. I proved it.

As soon as she's free,

she could run straight to him
and tell him everything.

Okay. You know what? You're right.

It'd be naive to just trust me at my word,
so why don't we just come to an agreement?

Okay? Let's negotiate.

Do you want to buy my silence? I'm game.

That'd be ideal, but what do I have?

- A few hundred bucks?
- Please, Will.

- I don't want to die in here.
- You won't.

I promise.

And I mean it.
I won't let this situation go bad.

I've been through that.

I'm gonna let you out tomorrow.

After I've made some arrangements
for me to escape.

What?

Will, no! Will, don't leave! Will!

- Delilah will go free.
- Will! Please don't leave me.

Even if it means
breaking my own heart.

To be a man who's worthy of you,

Love, I have to let you go.

Goodbye, Love.

In another reality,

I'd be packing a picnic you made

for us to share at Griffith Park
instead of the passport Will made me

in case I ever needed it.

I'd be buying you peonies, Love,

not a plane ticket for tomorrow
at 9:02 a.m.

Oh, I wish things were different.
But now, I have to leave. Forever.

In another reality, I wouldn't have to lie
to Ellie about where her sister is.

For both of their benefit.

Oh, facial recognition.

Well, big sis will be back to Ellie soon.
Very soon.

No Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

You know those are my favorite.

You're going to need more than that.

You're gonna be in here
another 16 hours.

You're leaving again?

Oh, what the fuck are those?

- No. Uh-uh.
- No, no no no.

- No, no, no, no, no.
- Uh-uh, no.

They're time-release.

There's a timer. Watch.
I'll set it to three seconds.

And when it's up...

See? They unlock automatically.

So you eat, and we cuff you to the table,

and then we set the timer to go off
when I am on my way out of the city.

After that, you're free.

How will I get out?

I'm gonna leave the doors unlocked.

Once they're set,
you can't reset them till time's up.

I don't want you
to drive yourself crazy

trying to override the timer.

There is no override.

- Unlock.
- For what?

For your sister.

Okay.

I'm leaving this here
for when you get out.

I'm sorry
our friendship had to end like this.

She'll hate me forever,

but she'll be fine tomorrow.

You have aseverely fucked concept
of friendship.

Now all I have left
is to say goodbye

to you.

Okay, so they're all gluten-free
and gastritis-friendly.

- Oh, my God! The lemon. Incredible.
- Yeah? But is it perfect?

How does Moroccan chocolate sound?

- Like heaven in my mouth.
- Oh, yeah. Let's go with that one.

But you can't just agree.

What about this other recipe
I've been working on?

- It's vanilla and almond and praline and...
- Love, please.

Stop.

What? I'm...

- You just deserve the best. I'm just...
- Well, what's wrong?

Is this about Milo or...?

No. I mean, I was using Milo.

I haven't thought about him since he left.

- Will, on the other hand...
- Oh, okay.

There it is.
You think you let a good one get away.

No, I'm sorry.
Are we all conveniently forgetting

- that he lied to you?
- No one's forgetting.

But maybe he deserves a second chance.

I'm a Quinn.

Once burned, we tend to cut our losses
and move on.

Okay. You are not your family.

Your new mantra. You're welcome.

If you still want the guy, go get him.

- What if it's too late?
- Then he's not who you thought he was,

- and in that case, boy bye.
- Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

Yeah.

- I'm gonna do it.
- Good.

Good for you. I'm proud of you, Lovebug.

- You deserve it.
- Look at you. You're amazing.

Yes. You're thriving.
Look at what you've done.

...all three.

Wait, is that
the praline one right there?

Yeah...

"Dear Love.

You've changed me.

I used to see the world as black or white.

Now everything is gray and messy,
full of nuance

and beauty because of you.

In an alternate universe,
we'd still be together.

A team. Ready for anything.

But where I'm heading now,
I have to go on my own.

I want to be the man you think I am,

so know I am doing this
to do the right thing.

And that means saying goodbye.

Wolf you always, Joe."

Sport, you are not gonna believe this.

- I bet I'm also not gonna care.
- What's that?

I ran into none other
than Kathryn "Hurt Locker" Bigelow

at Manganiello's last D&D night.

I elevator-pitched her D-FOL. NBD, right?

Guess who just called me.

- Tell me.
- Her assistant. Okay?

Apparently, Kathryn read the book

after we talked,
and now she wants to see a script.

She's, like, thirsty for it, dude.

Ugh, if I don't feign enthusiasm,

he might burst into tears
or start freebasing. Or both.

Forty, wow. Congratulations.

- It is so well-deserved.
- Right?

Yeah, so we gotta get to work,
like, right now.

Oh, no.

The whole script needs a polish,
and I gotta get it to Kathryn, stat.

Literally,
her assistant used the word "stat."

What do you need me for?
Go over it with your manager.

No, I need your genius, 30 minutes,
then go on about your whatever.

Timing couldn't be worse,
but this is important to him,

which means important to you.

So, my parting gift to you.

It's creepy when you get quiet like that.

Thirty minutes, okay? That's all I have.

Schweet! You're so fucking money,
and you don't even know it.

So candid, I love it.

Wow, pedestrian.

- It's good, right?
- I'm still reading.

The truth? I don't want this movie
to actually get made.

Thankfully, odds of that are worse
than Forty's dialogue.

But at least I can keep him
from embarrassing himself.

Okay, there's a little exposition
in here that you don't need. Like here.

You don't need Dr. Nicky to say

how long he
and Beck have known each other.

- They already know that.
- True, but I want to emphasize it.

Why?

'Cause, man, like,

why should it always be the woman
keeping track of shit like that?

Feminism.

What's this fuckbonnet doing?

Hey, you can't park here!

- It's a no-parking. I said you can't...
- What're you doing?

You can't... What are you doing?

- Let me go!
- Oh! What the hell?

- What're you doing? Wait!
- Unhand me, brah!

- Rape!
- Wait!

- Rape! I said rape!
- No!

- Wait!
- Forty, shut the fuck up!

Fuck. Why is this happening?
What do I do?

Benji, Peach, Ron, Beck,
Jasper, Henderson.

Jasper goons? Salinger's?
Was Hendy involved in organized crime?

I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

And now I've dragged this poor idiot
into my bullshit.

You have to calm down, Forty.
You have to calm down.

Deep breaths.

I'm so sorry, Joe. This is all my fault.

What are you talking about?

I'm not the man
that you think I am. I'm...

I'm an addict.

I know you're an addict.

No, Joe. A gambling addict, okay?

It's called "cross addiction"
and when it rains, it pours.

I've been in the hole for months.

I told them I was gonna make
the money back with this movie,

but they are obviously...

How's this for an act one
turning point?

Syd Field would be proud.

Though if this were a movie,
I wouldn't believe it.

No more talking!

All this time, I've been worrying
that my own sins would be my undoing,

only to be kidnapped
because of Forty fucking Quinn.

As cages go, this one's, uh, posh.

That was a little toasty, gentlemen.

Can we maybe use a more breathable hood
next time?

Oh, you should see your face right now.

Forty.

Did you hire these men to kidnap us?

It was pretty convincing, huh?

I really got you with that gambling shit,
didn't I?

Thank you,
Dame Helen Mirren's master class.

See you at the next meeting.

Yes, see you.

Igor's in the program,
and he and his brother Dimitri repo cars.

And I didn't think
they were gonna go for this, but...

anything for the right price, I guess.

This is fucking insane.

Even for you.

Okay, it's unconventional,

but we have to break out
of our comfort zone

if we are going to connect with the muse.

You connect with the muse.

I'm out of here.

Mmm. About that...

See, if either of us tries to leave,
Dimitri will shoot us.

Do... do you... even hear yourself?

Dimitri don't give a fuck, bro!

And B-T-dubs,
he confiscated all your shit,

so you might as well just settle in.

Dimitri.

Can I please have that back?

You...

write script.

Yes!

Okay.

Uh...

You're right. I mean, it is a great idea
to connect with the muse,

but I'm not very useful to you

- if I'm being held hostage. Should...
- No can do.

He will not let us out of here
until we have a completed script.

Relax, man. Stop fighting the process.

Besides,
I heard this is how Toni Morrison does it.

What?

She's, like, a very famous black chick
who writes books?

I know who fucking Toni Morrison is.

I highly doubt she writes at gunpoint!

Oh, no, no no.

I just meant that she writes in hotels.

Forty, I didn't sign up for this!

Could you get that?

- What are you doing here?
- What's all the noise about?

Hey.

What is she doing here?
This is not a safe environment for her.

Relax, Grandpa.

She's fine.
She's across the hall in um...

- Suite 216.
- Yeah.

And Dimitri knows that she can come
and go as she pleases.

Yes, but... what's she doing here?

He hired me
as your guys' writer's assistant.

Shit, Forty.
Uh... at least I can keep an eye on her.

I thought of everything.
This is gonna be fun. All right.

Now, uh, who wants room service?

Are we eating, or are we working?

Â¿Por quÃ© no los dos?

This crazy, entitled, sick
son of a bitch.

How has he lived this long?

And so many accidents can happen
in a hotel room.

No, no, I can do this.
Quickly fix the flawed script,

get my passport, and go off to Mexico
before Delilah's 16-hour hold is up...

and I leave you forever, Love.

"Wolf you always, Joe."

Glad I caught you.

Join me for dinner tonight.

You pick the place. Just the two of us.

What? Did your crackhead shaman tell you
to olive-branch me?

Don't be absurd.
Shaman Open conned our entire family.

Shaman Kevin, however,
is authenticity personified.

And, yes, he believes
I need to mend my relationship with you.

You disagree?

- You need a shaman to tell you that?
- Come on, Love.

I'm trying. I want us to be friends.

It's essential for my growth,
and I can't imagine it would harm yours.

Baby...

it's okay.

You need this just as much as I do,
you know?

Start breaking down the walls.

Let's start tonight.

We'll have cocktails and dessert,
and we'll have fun.

It'd be good for us.

Good for the whole family.

Okay, Mom.

- How's the dialogue trim going?
- Already got a page off.

Good. Okay, if we cut some fat
from the bottom of act two,

- the flow will be much smoother.
- Dope.

- What are you drinking?
- Kombexy. It's kombucha and dexedrine.

Oh, it's my secret weapon
for staying focused.

I'm diagnosed ADHD.

Of course you are.

Great. The pharmacy's open again.

I could pressure Forty
to face his eternal battle with sobriety,

- but that would take time I don't have.
- Boom!

With Ellie's edits, we are at 118 pages.

Same length as The Hurt Locker.

Fin.

Oh, thank God.

I hit every moment.

Check it, comrade.

Well, it's a script.

Who's the man, Joe? I'm the man!

I'm the man! I'm the man!

You look like somebody just pissed
all over your rainbow.

What's wrong with her?

Nothing's wrong with me.

I just don't think you're done.

- Oh, no, no.
- Say more.

- First off, the script is predictable.
- Okay,

I was staying true to the source material.

And the female perspective
is sorely lacking.

- Okay...
- No. Ellie is too smart

and way too honest. Shit.

Beck was real.
She humps a pillow multiple times!

Okay, okay. What would you suggest,
Sofia Coppola?

Don't do it, Ellie.

- I think you should start over.
- Fuck.

Figure out who Beck really is
and why you're the one to tell her story.

That seems a bit drastic.

Let's not...
Look, let's do a quick Beck pass, huh?

It's gonna need more than a quick pass.

Forty, where are you going?

I gotta get out of here.

Oh, great. Well, let's tell Dimitri
we're making a change of...

Forty, stop.

Wait, stop! What?

What?!

He does not handle criticism very well.

If I lose him,
I'll never get my passport back.

Smash cut to apocalypse.

Okay, go back to your room,

order all the food you want,
and go to bed.

I can't tell if you're a worse producer
or babysitter.

Just don't leave.

Ah.

White male fragility.

Six bars and finally...

- Got something against the hotel bar?
- It was too stuffy for me.

And also, I was blacklisted.

Got you a seltzer.

Figured you'd find me.

You're just like that.

Are these all you?

I politely requested
a bottle of tequila,

but the asshole bartender
wouldn't sell it to me,

so I had to buy it shot by shot.

How high is his tolerance?
How is he alive?

I can't imagine what it's been like
to watch this slow suicide

year after year.

- Why don't we go back to the hotel room?
- She's right, you know.

I don't know dick about writing women.

It is predictable, and it's not...

special.

Do not let this escalate.

Talk him off the ledge.

- You're talented.
- I'm a loser.

I'm such a loser,

I'm still texting the girl
who used the fuck out of me.

What girl? What are you talking about?

- You're not talking about...
- Amy. Sorry, Candace...

or whatever her name is today.

He's still in touch with Candace?

- Why are you two still talking?
- Closure.

She wants it. And I do too, I guess.

- This can't be happening.
- God!

Why can't I just meet, like, a nice girl

like Jessica Alba,

who won't lie to me,
and who just wants to have my babies

and love me forever?

Like... is that... is that too much to ask?

Of course not. You deserve that.

- Candace is not that. No more texting.
- That's what I want.

That's it.

Yes.

- Attention, everybody! Excuse me.
- Forty, stop.

Attention, everyone.

Congratu-fucking-lations, you two.
Get over here.

Come here.

I am feeling particularly generous
this evening,

and there is nothing sweeter in the world
than newlyweds.

So here is my proposal.

I will give the happy couple ten grand
in cash...

- Wow.
- Are you serious?

...if this handsome groom...

will let me kiss his beautiful bride.

Forty, let's get some coffee.

How dark is he going to get?

- I don't like this.
- I know, but we can pay the mortgage down.

Maybe he'll let it go.

No.

He enjoys this.

He's a sadist.

Hoo!

And before it's even begun...

- Enjoy it.
- ...Forty has ruined their marriage.

I've seen Forty the addict,
Forty the braggart,

the crybaby, the manipulator.

But I've never seen this side.

Your brother, Love, is dangerous.

Get me a drink.

No. We're going back to the hotel.

Get my passport, escape.

You're coming with me, or don't,

but I'm done.

Wait. Wait.

What... are you doing... now?

Since you're leaving me forever,

that is the time
you started drinking your seltzer,

and it's going to be very important
to you later

when you don't know where
or when the fuck you are.

Why wouldn't I know those things?

Oh...

I kinda definitely dosed
your seltzer water with LSD.

He's joking.

He has to be.

I just felt like we really needed this

if we were gonna have
a breakthrough tonight.

You drugged me?

Yeah. And I didn't know
how much you'd trip,

so I just gave you
four times the usual dose

to make sure that it would work.

I've never taken acid before in my life.

Oh...

Okay, you're gonna be fine.

Everything's gonna be fine.
Just three rules.

One, cars are real.

Two, anything you want to try,
please do it from the ground first.

And three, if you cannot stop sobbing,
just drink a Moon Juice.

Okay, sport. You gotta be careful
'cause you're about to feel everything.

All I feel is rage.

I tried, Love,
but your brother's a lost cause.

Hey. Let's get a selfie.

- Do we have to?
- Yes, why not?

Okay.

Nice.

So, is this what you had in mind?

Skin care advice and selfies?

Your father's cheating again.

Oh.

But it's fine.

Or it will be fine

once you, me, and Forty remind him
what an incredible family he has.

You know, him seeing us together here
is gonna make him very happy.

Wow.

Seven likes already.

Anyway, Forty's clean and working.

I have a healthy libido still.

Fuck you, menopause.

And, you know,
everything would be picture perfect

if you hadn't let Will slip away.

But c'est la vie.

- Anyway, we all have our part to play.
- No.

- Excuse me?
- No, I'm sick of us always pretending.

You pretending
that Dad's cheating doesn't hurt you.

Or that Forty isn't a walking time bomb.

No, instead you just slap
a Shaman Kevin Band-Aid on it.

That's not true.
You're completely off base.

Oh, like I was off base about you sweeping
the au pair incident under the rug?

You've had too much to drink.

What that woman did to Forty was criminal.

Then what did you do?
Oh, yeah, I remember.

A sage smudge.

- She should've gone to jail!
- It was impossible.

You pretended like it wasn't happening
until it was too late.

- He's your son!
- I did what I had to do!

You know,
I love this family unconditionally,

- and I will do...
- I know...

what unconditional love feels like.

This is not it.

Wikipedia says kick-in times
are variable.

This trip's gonna last, oh,
nine to 16 hours.

So getting my passport back quick
without Forty's help is job one.

I'll have to deal with Dimitri on my own.

Question is, where is he?

If only I hadn't been brought here
in a hood and jumped out the window.

Am I tripping, or is that you?

Hey, you.

Well, you smell a little drunk,
honestly.

What are you doing here?

Um...

I was hoping that I would run into you.

Forty mentioned

that he might be writing here
this weekend.

I saw you on his Instagram this afternoon,
and I put two and two together.

I'm gonna miss how smart you are.

That letter you wrote...

it shattered me.

Are you really leaving LA?

Your sadness, disappointment in me.

The goodbye I wanted to avoid.

Okay, well,

if you have to leave,

meet me tomorrow.

For lunch, okay?

You know, we've been through a lot...

in such a short period of time,
and I care about you.

Oh, no.

Can we just meet for one more lunch?

Shit. It's kicking in.

This is not how I want to remember you.

Oh...

- Okay.
- What? No.

- I understand.
- Speak.

No.

Love, Love.

Come here. It's in your hair, sweetie.

- I'm so sorry if she called you.
- I drank.

My daughter's having one
of her drama queen days.

- I'm sorry.
- I see it now.

- I'm sorry.
- Let's go get cleaned up.

Your mother's a demon,

dragging you to hell with her.

I have to rescue you from her.

Four hits of acid.

It's okay.

It's all in my mind.

- I've ridden harder rides.
- Where are we going?

Is that me?

Is my intuition telling me to go that way,

or is every horror fan in the universe

currently screaming
at me not to follow the creepy kid?

Did I teleport or...

No, it's acid.
This is a Grateful Dead concert.

I love you, Love.

I'll get through this.

Candace? No. Deadhead concert.

Very bad writer.

I'm sorry tonight didn't turn out
as you expected.

I swear I didn't mean to upset you.

We just...
never talk about the right things.

If I did such a horrible job,
how'd you turn out so well?

Oh, you're biased.

Or you're lying.

I never lie to you.

You're the only other Quinn
who can handle the truth.

I know I can be hard on you sometimes,

and that's because you're strong, like me.

I really do see so much of myself in you.

One day you'll have children,
and you'll understand.

When they need you,

like you need me right now,

it's no longer so hard to love them.

I'm gonna get us our suite.

Meet me up there whenever you're ready.

Joey! Joey! Joey.

Mom?

Hey. Welcome back, Mr. Producer.

Your mom's not here, but use that.

Ellie was right.

The whole thing needs to be
from Beck's perspective.

What does Beck want?

What did Beck feel?
What did Beck dream about?

Beck,

the poor girl who lost her life
to give us this story,

what was she searching for
in that sea of men?

We need to see her, Joe!

- Beck! Come on, man! Think!
- Beck! Come on, Joe! Think!

I think I'm dead.

He poisoned me,
and I died, and this is my hell.

I need to become Beck.

I need the earth to split open
and swallow me whole.

Let's role-play.

You be Dr. Nicky, I'll be GB.

- I can't.
- Come on.

I was your patient.

Why did you take advantage of me?

I am not doing this.

Why did you take advantage of me?

- I was trying to help you.
- I needed a therapist,

not some psychotic asshole posing
as Prince Charming.

Okay.

- I hear you.
- What gives you the right?

- You thought that I would be grateful?
- ...grateful?

Your life was a mess!

Yes, but it was my life!

- And I didn't need some sociopath...
- And I didn't need some...

- ...on a white horse to clean the house.
- We can't do this!

Come on, Joe, do it.

- Choke me. Do it. Don't be a pussy hat.
- Forty, I can't do this!

- You're not special. You're broken.
- You're not special. You're broken.

I could never love you.
You are the bad thing.

You are the thing
that you should have killed.

Do it.

Wow. That was, like, um...

Joaquin-level method. Way to s...
Way to commit.

Respect.

Oh...

Okay, okay. Uh-oh. Crying.

You know what that means.
Rule number three,

we're just gonna drink
some Moon Juice, okay?

What fucking Moon Juice?
We don't have any Moon Juice.

Shh, shh, shh.

You're gonna go to Anavrin,

you're gonna buy some Moon Juice.

Maybe some cassava chips,

some dried apple slices.

What about Dimitri?

"Mama Ru" is the safe word.

If you just say that, he'll let you out.

There's been a fucking safe word?

Of course.

I'm not a crazy person. All right?

But we can only use it once,

so make it count.

I wou... Oh.
I would come with you, but, um...

I think I'm peaking.

You can do this, Joe!

Mama Ru! Mama Ru!

What? How the hell did I get here?

Is this the hotel room?

Did I leave and come back? Or...

What in the hell?

Was the blood real? Did I wash it off?
Is it on my shirt? Was that really there?

What is even real?

How long was I gone and what did I do?

Grocery bags. That is a clue.

Good. You stopped crying.
What did I tell you?

Moon Juice is the shit.

- Did I leave this room?
- Yeah.

Where do you think all this came from?
Feeling good about Beck now.

When you were, um... strangling me,
I really got it.

I don't have a car, so...

How did I get to Anavrin?

Or back?

How should I know?

I am breaking story, brah.

I'm, like, balls deep
in Dr. Nicky's psyche over here.

How do you think Dr. Nicky
hid his sociopathy for so long?

How long was I gone?

- Answer my question, I'll answer yours.
- Why does he have to be a sociopath?

Maybe he's a man
who would do anything for love.

Your turn. How long was I gone?

About an hour.

Not enough time to get all this
and do something bad.

Or three.

Difficult to say. I was in flow.
Somewhere between one and three hours.

- You're getting that look again.
- What look?

That weird panicky look you had
when you came in.

You kept saying
there was blood on your hands.

- Was there?
- Couldn't say.

Yeah. Every time I looked at your hands,
all I could see was lobsters.

Who else might've seen me?

Dimitri.

Dinner break. What?

When I came back from the store,
did I have anything on my hands?

No. Hands clean.

Go write.

Okay. This is good. Hands clean.

Everything's fine.

On track. Mexico City. 9:02 a.m.

Your ringtone, Love.

I need to make sure you're okay.

I need my phone.

- No phone.
- Man, it's important!

No phone!

I'm trying to work!

You're welcome.

Thank you.

Be normal.

I'm normal.

- Hey you.
- Hey.

You look terrible. Are you in a bathroom?

Yeah, I... I, uh...

I'm... I'm sorry...

if I seemed weird earlier

in the hall.

I was...

overwhelmed saying goodbye.

No. That's why I'm calling. Okay?

Listen to me.

No to goodbye.

I refuse your goodbye.

You are the first thing in so long
that has felt right.

Now, I grew up with toxic,
conditional love, and I am done.

I forgive your stupid lie.

I just... I want to be with you.

I want a life with you.

Do you...

want that, too?

Yes.

More than anything!

Okay.

Whatever you're running from,
we can figure it out together.

If only that were true.

Once Delilah's free, we can't be here.

Um...

What if we...

What if we leave together?

Start over.

Just the two of us.

Away from your parents.
You could finish cooking school in Paris.

Or anywhere. Anywhere you want.

Wow, that sounds amazing, but...

what about Forty?

I can't... leave him with them.

Um...

Yeah. Of course.

We'll take Forty with us wherever we go.

Thank you.

Thank you.

I am so happy.

I can't wait. Okay.
Will you meet me tomorrow morning?

Um...

I have something to tend to.

But then I'm yours.

I wolf you.

I wolf you more.

This night does have a silver lining

We will make it work.

I'll negotiate with Delilah,

buy her silence.
We will be in another country.

We won't have to look over our shoulders.

Forty, we'll, uh, figure that one out.

Everything is going to be all right.

Joey...

There you are.

- You gave Mommy a scare.
- You are not here. This isn't real.

Oh, Joey...

Do you really think your love story
is gonna have a happy ending?

- Stop.
- People like us don't change.

I've changed.

Then why are you already thinking of ways
to get rid of Forty?

I'm not. I haven't been.

So many accidents that can happen
in a hotel room, can't they?

- You're not real. I'm not gonna...
- Of course

you're gonna kill him.

Just like Delilah.

It was a done deal
once you threw her in that cage.

She's already dead.

You're wrong.

I let Will out.

And I'm gonna let Delilah out.

I've changed.

Are you sure?

Forty.

Are they real?

Are my hands... Are...

Whoa.

I figured it out.

And you were right. It wasn't sociopathy.

It was a crime of passion
by someone who loved her.

Where is he going with this?

But Dr. Nicky didn't love her.

She was just his side piece.

Her ex-boyfriend loved her, though.

What ex-boyfriend?

She mentions him a few times in the book.

Casually. Never even by name.

He seems harmless.

But he murdered her in a jealous rage,
and he framed Dr. Nicky.

Nobody suspected him, though.

He's just a... normal guy.

Like you or...

me.

You want to know how I figured it out?

It's okay, baby.

I'll forgive you.

I'll tell you how I know.

Because it's exactly what I did.

I was in love with Sofia,

our au pair.

My parents said I was too young,
but... I wasn't.

I loved her.

And she loved me.

It wasn't just some dumb crush.

It was love.

When I found out she was seeing
some college guy,

I felt this rage inside of me.

Like an animal made of teeth and of fire.

And I blacked out.

And I killed her.

I came to,
and I was standing over her.

My parents made it look like a suicide.
Made it go away.

Do you know...

how painful it's been?

Carrying around a secret like that?

More than he'll ever know.

You were just a kid.

A confused kid.

You're forgiven.

You don't think I'm a monster?

No.

I think you have a bright future.

And on acid, at least,
he's a savant.

What you just pitched to me,

it's a great movie.

I think you should write it.

You should fictionalize it.

Taking as many liberties
as possible.

You should write it.

Um...

I, um... don't know what's going on
between you and my sister, but...

she would be crazy to let you go.

I think we're gonna make it.

It's been 11 hours.

Most of it must be out of my system
by now.

And there's still time.

I'm sober and free.

Forty?

Let's, uh, hope
he just went out for coffee.

Come on, Ellie, I don't have time.

- What?
- Hey, um,

do you think you could get yourself home?

Can I pick up my phone
and request an Uber?

Yeah, I think I can manage that.

Okay, great. Well, see...

Now, I just have to get to Delilah
before those cuffs open up.

In another reality,

I'd be heading to the airport, but...

I'm rewriting our movie, Love,
because of you.

The hero races to the cage,

he raises the door, and steps inside,
eager to set Delilah free,

and begin the rest of his life.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

We're friends, Delilah.
We're good friends.

I'm not going to hurt you.

Please!

But I wouldn't have. No.

No, no... no.

I don't want to die in here.

You won't.

I promised. I meant it.
I wouldn't have done this.

I worked so hard for you, Love.

This couldn't have been me.

But she was a threat to us.

She could've exposed me. Kept me from you.

I had motive.

I want to be with you.

No, it doesn't make sense.

Because if I did this,
I don't deserve you.

What it makes me, there could be no us.

I knew that. I knew that!

The acid.

What happened last night?

I have to know who killed Delilah.

Even if it was me.

The bar. We were at the bar.

Everything was fine. And that was...
What? Eight-ish?

Cheers!

That is the time
you started drinking.

You drugged me?

Dosed, 8:52 p.m.

And then things were not fine.
I don't know where or when the fuck I was.

Are you really leaving LA?

My daughter's having
one of her drama queen days.

Too much time unaccounted for.

That is time to murder.

If not, where was I?
What the hell was I doing?

- Go for Forty.
- Forty, I am so glad I got you.

I was hoping that...

Sucker. Leave a message.

Hey, it's me. It's Joe.

Oh, what a night.

I wanted to check in on you,
so call me when you get this. Thanks.

Okay, step one.

She needs to be alive.
I can't have people looking for her.

Like Officer other David Fincher.

Shit. Ellie.

No, I couldn't have done this to her.

Right. Facial recognition. That's great.

Let's go.

Shit!

I can't just leave her here.

Whoever did this either left in a hurry
or just wanted this to be my mess.

Is this a frame job?

Are the police on their way?

I should run.

No. I can't leave her here.

I can't leave her for anyone to find.

I also can't move her in broad daylight.
I've got to wait till dark.

It's taking a chance either way,

but Los Angeles heat,

decomp's gonna happen fast.

At best, buys five to six hours.
But I'll make the most of it.

Figure out what the hell happened
last night.

T, M.

Dude, slow down.
You'll be dead before you kiss the girl.

He was the only one who knew
this was here.

I took his name. Caged him.

I mean,
revenge wouldn't be out of the question.

Why kill Delilah, not me, though?

You exposed us, and now they're...

Could have been off his meds. Right.

Hello?

Kamusta?

Uh, hi. I'm looking for Will.

Hello?

He didn't give a real number

because he is not in Manila?

He was here, killing Delilah?

Hello, friend! What's up?

Will!

Oh! See that? Living proof.

I have let people out of the cage,

made friends, even, from the experience.

Was that Gigi who just picked up?

It's everything I told you, man.

I never doubted it.

Okay, I did. But I shouldn't have.

Like I shouldn't have considered Will
a suspect.

He is a good man.

Why do you look like someone hit you
on the head with a rock,

threw you in the trunk of their car?

I'm tired, that's all.

Talk to a brother. Joe, you can tell me.

Why do you think I gave you
my real number?

Honestly, Will,
you have some real mental health issues.

Because...

I know you can get yourself
in interesting jams.

But you want to do right.

- If I can help...
- Why do you wanna help me?

We all just gotta just try
and do the decent thing, moving forward.

You know when you pick up a spider,

and you bring it outside
because you want it to live?

But let's say when it's in your hand,

it dies anyway,
and you don't know if it's your fault.

But it was in your hand?

Well, no, it's... I mean,
it's an imperfect metaphor,

but the... the point is,
you... you wanted it... to live.

If I'm hearing you right...

you have someone in your cage...

who is now dead.

But you don't think you killed them.

Will, it wasn't me.

I mean, I don't know that
because I was on a lot of drugs.

But I was going to let her go.

Just like you.

I don't think you'd kill someone
you intended to keep alive.

Honestly, Will, I don't know
what happened, and I have to know.

I really feel like I...
I would not have done this.

I believe you.

But, end of the day...
only you know who you really are.

Whether you really wanted
to let that spider go or not.

Thanks, Will.

Anytime, Will.

I don't think I did this to you.

I'm going to prove I didn't.

Find out who did.

Far be it from Forty to answer a text.

Especially when he's responsible
for my night being a black hole.

I would be sleeping off
the night's debaucheries

if I hadn't woken into a nightmare.

I'll rest
when there's not

a murderer on the loose.

It's open.

Hey.

Whoa.

I thought I had a rough night.

Love, hey.

- Weren't you writing?
- Yeah, your brother's got a process.

What are you doing here?

You don't... remember?

Oh, God, was I that drunk?

Did I get this wrong
and I'm just embarrassing myself...

Of course I remember.

The greatest call of my life.

- The greatest?
- Yes.

If we're together, we're okay.

I love you.

I love you... Love.

I can figure this out for us.

Oh, about that. Um...

"I'd go anywhere for you" thing?

I meant that, I did.

But now that I am sober...

could we just slow down that part
a little bit?

Of course.

- Okay.
- Perfect.

Because time is what I need
to find out who did this to Delilah,

clear my name, protect you,
confirm I'm worthy of you, Love.

Uh...

Does this mean
you're not screwing my sister anymore?

- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

Probably just the four tabs of acid
working their way out of his system.

You were on acid last night?

That's your brother's process.

I didn't know he was gonna dose us.
I kept him out of trouble.

Okay, but where is he? Is he okay?

I can't believe
you didn't mention anything.

Forty's fine.

I saw him get in the car
when I left the hotel, like, an hour ago.

Speaking of missing people...

Anyone see my sister?

- No.
- I haven't seen her.

It's fine.

I just wanted to show her
this death threat she got.

What? Let me see that. What?

This is awful.

Because of the article?

Is that what happened?

Some Henderson crazy followed me
to the cage?

Slit Delilah's throat
because she showed them who he really was?

- We should show it to the police.
- I will.

Hey, Ellie. Maybe you shouldn't go back
to your apartment

till your sister gets back.

But we can walk to the market.
I can make you some breakfast.

Okay. Um...

Yeah, we'll let Will shower off the night,
and we can get going.

Poor girl has no idea
her life is about to change.

Forever.

Joey.

You don't have to hide.

Remember when we came back,

what I said?

How things would be different?

I meant it.

He's never gonna hurt us again.

Ever.

You hear me?

What the...?

The hell?

Freeze, asshole!

- Calvin.
- Crying...

You know what that means.

Rule number three.

- If you cannot stop sobbing, just drink...
- Moon Juice.

You're gonna go to Anavrin.

I left while I was tripping.

Went to Anavrin.

What says
I didn't make a detour to murder?

Or I went straight to Anavrin and back.

Maybe Calvin can put me there long enough
to account for all the lost time.

- Bettelheim. Right?
- Other Fincher.

- Just what I need.
- I'm sorry, what's your nameagain?

Fincher.

Officer Fincher.

That's right. Delilah's friend.

You seen her around lately?

Hm, and operates
with all the nuance of Columbo.

I haven't, actually.

Now, if her phone worked, I could
have her tell him she's chasing a lead

from Paul Rudd's holistic nutritionist,
but alas, it doesn't.

I hope she's okay.

Why would you say that?

Well... her sister, Ellie,
mentioned she hadn't seen her either.

And, actually...

they got this.

I was gonna bring it by the station.

Apparently, that article she wrote
has got a lot of Hendy fans stirred up.

And I hate to overreact.

Supposedly, some real sickos
have been DMing her.

One even broke into Henderson's place

and tried to stab him a while back...
But I mean, I'm sure you know all this,

after what happened to him.

- Of course.
- So...

Again, I'm probably overreacting...

but I'm glad
someone's looking out for her.

And at the risk of laying it on...

Oh, and I should tell you...

she broke things off with me.
I think she really likes you, man.

Uh...

If you see her, have her call me.

Will do.

Statistics force me to consider
Officer Douchebag as a suspect.

Too often, it's the jealous boyfriend,
spurned lover.

As much as I'd like to pin it
on him,

all I see is a heartsick puppy dog.

Okay, you gotta remember the part

where you were ranting about
how all the peaches were mad at you.

Calvin, I'm glad you find this so funny.

- I just really need to find...
- I know, find your wallet.

Uh, just, the next time you do acid,

please record it for your future self.

And by that, I mean all of us.

Believe me. I wish I had.

What... What time would you say
that I got here?

11:18. How do I know that?
Because you didn't turn the alarm off.

Made me come down here and jump your ass
like you were some common criminal.

So, I just got a Moon Juice,

and then... when did I leave?

Oh, uh, you were all on me about Cheetos.

Like we carry that ish.

Cheetos? Oh, no.

- Had to be...
- Flamin' Hot?

Ah! So you do remember some fun stuff.

For Delilah.

You kept saying you needed snacks
for the basement.

You kept asking me where the door was.

- I was like, "Sweetie, this is California.
- No basements."

The basement.

I must've thought
that's where the cage was.

I was headed to see Delilah.

Hold on. None of this stuff was there.

No Cheetos, nothing. So...

Did I happen to mention
where I was headed when I left?

Yeah. That would suggest a level
of clarity that you did not possess.

Which is why I didn't say anything
last night,

but you need to pay the store back,
even when Forty's with you.

Forty was with me?

You're kidding, right?

I thought he never left the hotel.

You don't remember him
trying to get one of us

to shove a Grey Goose-infused tampon
up his ass?

So he could keep his high
at a "cruising altitude"?

If Forty was with me,

I would avoid the storage unit
at all costs.

That's why none of the food
for Delilah was there. I never went.

If only my alibi would pick up
his fucking phone.

And by now, Love,
you're wondering where I am.

Hey! Uh-uh. I think one cup's enough
for a 15-year-old.

Okay.

Okay, now.

If you could chop these?

- Okay.
- Here.

You can tuck your fingers underneath.

- It's safer that way and hold the knife...
- Like this?

- All right.
- Now hold your knife like this.

- Up here?
- Mm-hmm.

- Like that?
- Yeah, that's it.

So, how long have you and your sister
been on your own?

I guess my amazing life here started
after my dad got sick.

Which is awesome

when he's your only friend in the world,
and you also hate your mom.

Oh.

Okay. Sounds like we have the same mom.

The punchline, obviously,
is that my dad died.

Don't. It's so awkward.
Let's just move on.

Um...

How are these?

I mean...

if the film thing doesn't work out,

you should consider culinary school
in Paris.

Those are really even. That's really good.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

So your dad left you
with the shitty parent. And then what?

Delilah bolted first.

I endured a couple more years,
and then showed up and ruined her life.

It's fine. Feeling's mutual.

- Something like that?
- Yeah. I can take those.

Thank you.

I pray your brother's home,
just so I can figure this out, Love.

Will. What a pleasant surprise.

- Wish I could say the same.
- Come in.

I was sorry to hear you're leaving LA.

Actually, I'm still working on that.

Nothing's definite yet.

Well, then perhaps
we can persuade you to stay.

Please.

I wanted to thank you.

Forty was all but inconsolable
when I picked him up this morning.

He said you were really there for him
last night.

I was?

The night's a bit blurry.

You don't have to pretend with me.

I know what he confessed to you.

Confessed?

I killed her.

Holy shit! How could I forget?

My husband and I appreciate the burden
our son's put on you.

We also want you to know
we're here to ease your burdens.

However great they may be.

Your secrets are safe with us, Will.

Never has a threat worn
such a luxuriant veil.

And just what is it your parents think
they know about me?

What the hell did I tell Forty last night?

- Mom!
- I'll let him know you're here.

Add it to the list of mysteries.

No.

- Couldn't be.
- Joe...

Would you fuck me?

Come on. You would totally fuck me.

Forty's my alibi, not my suspect.

Just because he killed before
doesn't mean he'd...

Well, unless he was crying to your mother
this morning

because he killed again.

Did I tell him I had Delilah in the cage?

That she was the reason
I had to give up on you and leave town?

Would Forty kill to keep us together?

Old sport.

Aw.

Comedown is a bitch.

But that trip. I mean...

We touched God.

Like, "tickled-His-balls" touched.

Inspired work, Broseph.

Forty?

My Gaia. My Isis.

Oh, thank you.

Soothed my weary soul, as usual.

I love you.

Bye, boys.

Hoo!

What an epic night. Ooh!

Look at him.
Heâd have to be a complete sociopath.

Or blacked out.

Oh, are you gonna puke?

'Cause that's totally fine,
just not over here.

It's antique camel hair on demo.

That is for you.

Bro, seriously?

You complete me.

I have to admit, I'm a little foggy. Uh...

I remember we made the run to Anavrin.

Yeah, that place.

Where did we go after Anavrin?

What was that?

You know, um...

- It's kind of a blur.
- He's lying.

Why is he lying?

We stopped somewhere else, right?

Yeah. Again, man, it's such a blur.
I don't really know. Um...

Are you okay?

You know, this is your fault.

All right? You were the one that wanted
to go see Delilah, and...

I would never have done it
if it werenât for you.

Holy shit. It was him.

I'm like, really, really sorry.

What are you sorry for?

I know that you know what I did.

I was with Candace last night.

Candace?

I know that I screwed up.

But if you hadnât booty-called Delilah,
I never would have called her.

Booty-call?

Forty has no idea what happened.

I told you that we should go back to work,

but you made Igor drive us
to that random corner downtown.

What is this place, Betteljuice?

Is "Delilah," like,
code for you getting homeless vag?

He didnât do it.

He dropped me off
and then went to screw Candace.

You told me to go.

Worse, he left me there alone.

So youleave me on a corner?

- Completely out of my mind?
- Yeah.

Look, I fucked up, all right?

And I fucked her, and I fucked us.

I told you we were only sexting
now and again...

Motive, I had.
He gave me means. Opportunity.

I was lonely, okay? And, like...

redheads, you know?
I just figured whatâs the harm in...

"Whatâs the harm"?

I had to leave everything behind
because of her.

- She is the reason I lost everything.
- But you found Love.

How could you leave me for her?

Iâm really, really so sorry.

Please forgive me. Joe, come on. Please?

I can forgive your brother
for seeing Candace.

What I canât forgive
is him leaving me there

with a head full of acid.

Look...

Oh, God.

Okay, I'm gonna be right back. Okay?

I'm just gonna be right back!

Unless this was Candace.

Some elaborate plot to set me up.

But why kill Delilah?

Why not just kill me?

She had her chance.
Still, this doesnât mean it was me.

Forty can put me there.
Whatâs to say I went in?

Hold up.

Hey, wait.

Take this.

Give it to Delilah.

And when you fuck her,

you think of me.

Okay?

So don't ghost me.

All right?

Or do.

Get it?

Oh, man.

But why canât I remember it?

Am I just clenching my eyes shut
against some truth I donât want to face?

Hey, you.

You need to get over here now.

Ellie's freaking out.

Hey, hey. Um...

Everything was fine, and then...

She's convinced something happened
to her sister.

Stay the hell away from me.

Ellie.

I said stay the hell away from me!

Don't! Let go! No!

- Stop!
- It's okay.

Stop. Let go. Let go of me. Stop.

Let go.

It's just me.

It's gonna be okay.

Itâs not gonna be okay!

Itâs always gonna be a mess!

- What? Whatâs gonna be a mess?
- My life.

My whole fucking life!

Why won't she respond to my texts?

Iâm sure she has a good reason.

Sheâs never left me alone
this long before.

I know something happened to her.

You donât know that.

She was pulling away from me.

I could tell.

Everybody wants to get away from me!

Why?

Whatâs wrong with me?

Ellie.

There's nothingâs wrong with you.

Nothing.

Itâs not you.

It's me.

Don't ever think that.

I know what you see, Love.
A good man.

But I have my doubts.

You are a genius, Forty Quinn.

If I was your agent,
I would be sucking your dick right now.

That's quite an endorsement.

Well, somebody woke up
on the wrong side of an acid trip.

Okay. Um, look...

- Last night was a mistake. Okay?
- Yeah.

The good kind, right?

No.

- I was high.
- Yeah.

I hate when I slide
into a girlâs vagina without meaning to.

Stop. No. Iâm serious.

If Joe hadnât booty-called Delilah,
I would never...

Wait, what?

The manager from his place?

That Delilah?

See? Heâs right.

You are all about him.

- And you were just using me...
- Wait, Joe said that?

- Did he tell you what to say to me?
- God. Just stop.

You are obsessed with him.

I mean, why else would you still be here

after my sister paid you to go?

I am trying to protect you...

and your sister
from a guy who buried me alive.

So you say.
You also said your name was "Amy Adam,"

which, come to think of it,
sounds really stupid.

What, was "Britney Spear" already taken?

If you had a brain,

you could read
between the lines of your own script

and see that you cracked the case.

Hector, the hot sculptor boyfriend
who got jealous and killed Beck

and framed Dr. Nicky?

Itâs Joe.

Okay, so now if Dr. Nicky is so innocent,

why don't you take your theory to him?

I tried.

He wouldnât talk to me. No one will.

You know, itâs a little hard
when everyone sees you as the crazy ex.

Maybe ask yourself why that is.

Oh, God.

God!

What is it about Joe fucking Goldberg?

Why is it that no one can see him
for what he is?

Careful. You're talking about my family.

Huh.

Donât come crying to me
when he kills your sister.

One of those days,

it seemed the sun
was in a rush to come down.

Good thing.
With it comes the cover I need.

No closer to knowing who killed Delilah.

But I got to get her body off my hands.

Only question is how.

Not getting caught, that I can manage.
I've been here before.

Itâs Ellie. What is best for her?

That is what I promised her.

Promised them both.

Is it better to know Delilahâs dead...

...or always wonder?

Which version of this is worse?

Get Delilahâs phone fixed, man.

Give Ellie a sister a little longer.

She hears what she needs to
before losing Delilah forever,

and the rest would be on us.

If there can be an us.

If Iâm not the monster
who took Ellieâs sister,

we could take care of Ellie.

Be a family.

Thatâs the best ending of all.
The one where love makes everything okay.

Delilah.

Itâs Amy.

Willâs ex.

Look, if youâre in there, open up,
all right?

Fuck.

Amy Candace.

I was just thinking.

We never got to live out
our spectrophilia fantasy.

Ours is a forbidden love,
but if Iâm a ghost, right?

I mean, Iâll be in and out,
and you wonât even know it.

I mean, youâll definitely know it, but...

Wait. Hold up! Hold up.

Take this. Give it to Delilah.

And when you fuck her, think of me.

Promise? Anyway, so don't gho...

Delilah.

Iâm so sorry.

I donât know what happened to you,
and I want to know.

I told you you would walk out of here.

And I failed you.

But Ellie will be okay.

She will know you love her.

And no matter what...

I will never let her get hurt.

- Back the fuck up!
- Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

Ah! Oh!

I told you, Joe.
It was just a matter of time.

This isn't what it looks like.
I didnât do this.

Oh, bunny.

Your phone.

- Now!
- Oh, shit!

- Give me your phone, Joe.
- Okay, okay.

- All right.
- Unlock it.

- I can't fucking see.
- Now!

Hang on.

The police are never gonna believe you.

Youâre locked in a cage
with a dead body, Joe.

I think they might believe me this time.

What are you doing?

What are you gonna do?

Thought Love might like to come
and see what youâve done.

No, please! Candace...

Candace, donât do that.

- Leave her out of this.
- You wish.

Sucks to have someone pretend to be you,
doesnât it, Joe?

If I killed this woman,

then I deserve this.

I thought I only ever acted
from a place of love.

To protect.

- No!
- Stop!

But what type of man would do this?

I'm gonna show you
who you really are.

Has Candace been right all along?

Have I been fooling myself?

Have I just been refusing to face
who I really am?

- Fucking lying!
- No!

Stop! Youâre hurting me!

- Get off of me!
- Fucking lying!

- Stop!
- Tell me his fucking name!

Get away from me!
Let go of me! You're crazy!

What am I?

What did you do?

What did you do?

You shouldnât have done that, Joey.

You shouldnât have done that, Joey.

You shouldnât have done that, Joey.

What did you do?

- Love.
- What's going on?

What did you do?

Told you what he did to me,

Beck, and God knows who else.

You couldnât believe me, so I proved it.

Let him out of there.

No.

This asshole is going to be in a cage
for the rest of his life.

Call the cops.

I just wanted you to see it first.

You're crazy.

Tell her.

Tell her you didnât do this!

I did.

Sheâs right.

Everything she said about what I did...

is true.

Iâm sorry.

Youâre not crazy.

I tried to kill her.

I blamed it all on her.

But that was a lie,

like so many others.

I thought I was doing it
for the best reasons,

for love.

But, Love...

it wasn't.

It was never really love.

I never knew love until I met you.

I would do anything for you.

I just want to be good enough for you.

I told myself that I could be different,
I could do it another way.

But if that was true...

Delilah wouldn't be...

dead.

I couldn't face the truth
because I didnât want to lose you.

I did this.

She figured out I'd killed Henderson,

and I killed her.

Is this how I was always
destined to end?

Alone, unloved,
waiting for the police to arrive?

Could things have gone any differently?

If Iâd walked
into a different bookstore...

- Who am I to you?
- You're an asshole.

One not run by a Soviet
prison guard.

Or maybe...
if Iâd had different parents...

Mom? Mommy?

You were protecting me.

It had to be done.

Youâre a good boy, Joey.

Everythingâs gonna be okay.

Listen carefully to every word I say.

You would never hurt anyone.

And that's the truth.

Never.

Much less kill someone.

No...

You're a good boy.

It was just an accident.

A terrible... accident.

Yeah. Yeah, okay?

Iâm done with excuses.

I'm done blaming everyone else
for the things Iâve done.

I once told Beck,

I learned a lesson
when Mooney locked me in.

Hide a spare key.

Love! Hey!

God, leave me alone!

So you can get out
of the goddamn cage.

Love.

But itâs time I take responsibility.

Love.

Accept the punishment for my crime.

That a cage is where I belong.

Whereâs Candace?

What happened?

I took care of it.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

Dostoevsky wrote,

"If a man has a conscience,
he will suffer for his mistake.

That will be his punishment
as well as his prison."

Everything's gonna be okay.

What did you do?

Why are you looking at me like that?

I'm so sorry.

Why? I mean, she was crazy.

She was gonna hurt you.

And us.

And I fixed it.

We can be together now.

I don't think we can.

I think I broke you.

- I'm fine.
- Listen to me.

This is not your fault.

This is not you.

Everything I told you is true.

Beck, Henderson,

Delilah...

I killed them.

Their blood is on my hands.

Joe.

You didn't kill Delilah.

I did.

- You know that old clichÃ©...
- You're a sneaky, manipulative bitch.

"You can choose your friends,
but you canât choose your family."

My brother
and I learned that lesson early.

We can still enjoy what we have, right?

Absentee parents, too self-absorbed
to notice a fox in the henhouse.

- Hold on, what are you...
- Shh.

Nobody to show us
what healthy caretaking should look like.

Forty was a child.

She was a rapist.

I stopped her.

I protected Forty because I had to.

Because nobody else was.

Better they thought it was him.

Forty was blacked out, a victim.

Theyâd cover it up,
coddle him like always.

I could stay close, protect him.

We need utter privacy...

But families donât heal
from something like that.

So I began to fantasize about a new one.

If we were ever lucky enough to have it.

When James died,

I wondered if the family I had
was the only one I deserved.

And then I saw you.

I knew right away, in my gut,

I recognized something in you. And, hey,

smart, sexy, funny,

a little darkness that made you
less storybook, more real.

I started to fantasize again.

When you pulled away,
I told myself, "I can fix him."

For a while, it was working.

I showed you how to heal.

Oh, you were stronger than I knew.

I showed you what I wanted
by showing you what I didnât want.

When you stood by me, united,

I knew together we could be better
than the family I was born into.

I wolf you.

I wolf you too.

Maybe I got a little obsessed.

Maybe I used my parents' means
to do a little digging after Candace left.

They owed me that much.

I devoured your dead exâs book,
front to back.

All the articles, all the think pieces,

reading between the lines.

And I realized,
Guinevere Beck was unspecial and mediocre.

She didnât deserve you.

And then,

I found the real you, Joe.

You were even smarter,

more passionate,
more devoted than Iâd known.

Youâre crafty...

and earthy.

And it must be said, you bring out genius.

Donât think Beck couldâve written that
in a million years without your push.

Yeah, you did some terrible things,

but thatâs what sensitive people do
when theyâre trapped

in a bad relationship.

I tried to coax the real you out.

If you could trust me,

show me your heart,
even the darkest parts,

then weâd be starting our future together
on the right foot.

But then, Delilah.

She found out who you were and recoiled.

You lost faith.

You were gonna give up on us.

Our little family in the making.

So I followed you.

Take this.

Give it to Delilah.

And when you fuck her,

you think of me. Okay?

Oh, thank God!
Oh, please, you have to help me.

Listen, Will is insane!

- Oh, my God.
- These handcuffs, I think there's a key.

I don't know if Will has it,

or if there's a spare.
I really don't know.

I promised him I wouldn't say anything
about what he did,

but I really don't think he believes me,

and so I really need your help.
I need to get out of here, please.

He said he'd be back later.
He's high on something.

Please, just hurry.
He'll hurt me, he'll hurt both of us.

Just hurry. Please just help me
before he gets back.

I dealt with Delilah the same
way I dealt with the au pair.

Iâm protecting you because I want to, Joe.

You didn't break me.

You opened your heart to me.

We're soulmates, Joe.

What the fuck?

Joe?

Please, say something.

What about Ellie?

Ellie? We have to talk about your sister.

Hey.

- It's okay, all right? I come in peace.
- At, like, three in the morning.

I mean, come on.

Do you know
Delilah's been getting death threats?

Yeah, I do.

And I was actually thinkingthat you might
be able to help me out with that.

How?

Uh...

I don't know, just walk me through
some of the stuff around Henderson.

Anything you might remember
that stands out.

No detail too small.

That sound chill?

I know this routine
from every movie I've ever seen.

You're trying to entrap me.

Ellie's gonna be fine.

And you don't think I would... You know...

If I didn't have a plan for her.

Oh, you have a plan?

It's simple.

First, we make Ellie a suspect
in Henderson's murder.

- What?
- Don't judge yet, okay?

Let me finish.

Step one,

we frame Ellie for Henderson's murder
with an anonymous tip.

Love, tell me you didn't already do that.

Where were you
the night Henderson was murdered, Ellie?

Yeah, Delilah's been protecting you.

Your texts with Henderson show
that he already had plans that night.

And a new tip places you
in his house the night he died.

I didn't do anything.

I just wanna take you down to the station,

ask you a few questions.

Step two

is lawyer her up
with the Quinn family's finest.

Between the total lack of evidence

and the fact
that she's a 15-year-old girl,

it instantly becomes a joke.

I'm letting you finish.

Well...

that's when Delilah's body
will be found with a suicide note.

She becomes a posthumous feminist icon
for taking down her abuser.

The shock waves will destroy the case.

Ellie will walk free
with settlement money for life.

She could even use this scandal
to jump-start her career.

And most importantly,

the investigation becomes poisoned.

And you are never mentioned in connection
with Henderson again.

That will never work.

I mean, it wouldn't...

if my family didn't basically own
the LAPD.

It's the way the au pair got cleaned up.

Ellie is going to emerge stronger,
smarter,

- and better off.
- Like Forty?

- Watch it.
- Okay, Ellie, then.

What kind of sick mind
thinks forcing a teenager

into the system is doing her a favor?

If you have a better idea,
I'm open to that.

I'm sorry, it's very hard to think clearly

in the river of crazy you're spewing!

Okay, get a grip.

I thought you were the last person
who'd be hysterical.

Hysterical? You killed Delilah!

Because you killed a fucking celebrity.

You know why this is happening?

Because while I was seeing you,

really seeing you,

you were busy gazing at a goddamn fantasy.

A perfectly imperfect girl.

You saw what you wanted to see.

But I was always right here,

the whole time.

It wasn't that hard.

You just had to look.

Um...

I have to finish making a wedding cake,
so...

Love. Love! Wait, wait, wait! Please.

Please, let me out.

Love? Love!

A crazy person has locked me in
a cage, but now is not the time to panic.

Ellie's in danger.

Is she, though?
What if Love's plan is good?

She sounded sincere. Slow down.
Think. Okay.

Now... do I believe Love
has Ellie's best interests at heart?

Nope. Okay. I have to get free.
That's clear. Simple. Impossible.

I think I finally understand
what Beck went through.

It is a lot to process.

What did Beck do in this situation?

- I love you.
- Right.

She pretended to love me.

All I ever wanted
from Beck was to be seen.

Really seen and accepted.

You saw me.
Even the parts I'm ashamed of.

You're asking me to see you,
to love you.

I don't know what to feel, Love.

But I know what to do.

Are you in trouble for the gun?

Not at all.

So, we can be together forever?

I love you so much, Joey. So, so much.

It isn't hard to convince somebody
you love them

if you know what they want to hear.

Have a good one, mate.

- D-FOL mobile production office.
- Forty, thank God.

Listen, Iâm at the police station
right now,

and they're not letting me leave.

I need you to bail me out

or whatever you did
for Will and my sister.

Wait, Ellie?

- What did you do?
- Nothing.

It has something to do with Henderson,
but I didnât do anything.

This cop Delilah knows brought me here,

and the guy who keeps trying
to ask me stuff,

I think heâs a homicide detective.

Please. Delilah's missing.

Can you just come down
to the Wilcox station?

No can do, Iâm on the East Coast.

Are you serious?

Sit tight, okay?
I'm gonna send Morris your way.

- Whoâs Morris?
- He's a family lawyer

on call for DUIs, D and Ds,
and bailouts under $600K.

He'll have you out in no time.

Forty, things are getting weird.

Hey, I promise. Iâve got your back, okay?

Just say nothing,

act dumb, and don't drink anything,

'cause they'll steal your DNA.

Dr. Nicky. Hi, Iâm Forty Quinn,

I'm the writer/producer
of the upcoming feature-length adaptation

of Guinevere Beckâs The Dark Face of Love,
directed by Kathryn Bigelow...

Yeah, that's great.
Could we just get to it, please?

The only reason why I'm here
is because the warden made me.

I'm assuming you bribed him.

Okay, brass tacks. I like that.

I'll just say it then.
I don't think you killed Guinevere Beck.

No shit.

Are you one of those fans,
the "Free Dr. Nicky" subreddit?

Former patients, conspiracy nuts.

Listen to me carefully.

Nothing they say matters.

They say that you're innocent.

Don't you want to go free?

No.

I'm guilty of destroying my marriage,

my wife, my kids.

I didn't kill Beck, but I am guilty.

I'm guilty of using her.

And she's not the first. She's...

She's the...
She's just the first to end up dead.

No, I'm a bad person.

I'm exactly where I deserve to be.

Wow, this is... not what I pictured
when I was writing you.

I expected more
of a wrongfully-convicted vibe.

I've had all that.

But by the grace of God,

I've been given eyes to see things
a whole other way.

You see, I've turned my body and my spirit

- over to a higher power.
- Yeah, me too, bro. All the steps.

I'm good, Mr. Quinn.

You know why?
'Cause I'm walking with Christ.

And if I repent,

- I will be forgiven in the end.
- Meanwhile, there's a killer out there.

Oh, there's evil everywhere in the world,
you see.

But I prefer to deal with the evil
that I see in the mirror each day.

Dope. Um...

You're not curious
about the mystery patient of yours

with the fake name
that could never be located?

Yes, I read the subreddit, okay?
It's fucking research.

I don't want to bring a whole media circus

down on a guy
who's just trying to work his shit out.

That...

That's Paul Brown.

Yeah. He told us his name was Will,
but his real name...

Stop.

If you're right,
you stay away from that man.

No, no. We can stop him.

No, no, no, no.

If he killed Beck...

there's no telling
what this man is capable of.

What's done is done.
He'll be punished, but not by us.

Trust in divine justice.

Put your faith in the universe, man.
It's the only thing that'll set you free.

Cool. Will do.

One problem.

He's dating my fucking sister, Reverend.

So, why don't you just tell me everything
that you know?

Or her death will be on you.

God bless you, and God bless your sister.

Fuck.

Amy turned me onto this memoir.

This, uh, main character, Beck.

It's Joe.

Shall we?

See you soon, Ms. Alves.

Yeah, have fun.

Oh, and one more thing.

Wherever your sister is,
sheâs got 12 hours to show her face,

or Iâm calling CPS
on an unattended minor.

You know,

in addition to the missing persons report
I just filed.

Can he do that?

Letâs talk outside.

Just give it a minute.

Itâs the Quinn family.

Yeah, well,
they always have a lot going on.

She might not stay
front of mind for too long.

You know what?

My schedule's clear.

There's no harm in putting a tail on her.

If I see anything fun, I'll call you.

Muffins?

Yeah, I, uh...
seem to remember owing you one.

I didn't have time to make a religieuse.

The first time I ever tasted a muffin...

was in a group home.

My mom never let me have one, ever.

Wow, that's basically child abuse.

And she said, "They're cupcakes, Joey.
Read the ingredients."

Well, she wasn't wrong.

- You never talk about her. Is she still...
- Alive?

Around.

She was a saint.

I was a handful.

It seems like you just wanted sugar
for breakfast.

Like a normal kid.

- At least you had her around back then.
- She did her best.

What are...

Are you fucking kidding me?

Is this what you're afraid of?

No poison, Joe!

No, no no no. Love. Love?

- You think I'm crazy.
- It's not that.

No. I didn't want to say anything.

About what?

I can't eat food

when there's a body rotting
three feet away from me.

I do need to eat.

Just open the cage.

Only long enough for me to move her out.

Love, I do trust you.

I need you to trust me.

I do.

Joe. No!

No, I'm pregnant!

I'm pregnant.

Joey...

Joey, I know you're in there.

Joseph.

Nothing bad's gonna happen.

Why are you hiding, bub?

He's here to take me away.

Just... for a little while.

I'm not... the best for you right now.

What happened. This is better.

Why did you let him come back
over and over again?

So you could have a dad.

You need a father.

I only need you.

I don't expect you to understand this,

but a boy needs a strong man

to teach him right from wrong.

I tried to give you that, but I failed.

What's wrong with you, it's my fault.

I'm sorry.

You needed a real father.

A father.

I'm going to be a real father.

Are you sure it's...?

I made Milo use protection.

Joe... Joe.

Say something.

Right.

Right, you think I'm a psycho now.

Did you actually believe
I wanted to hurt anyone?

I hated doing that to Delilah.

I'd just taken the test.
I had just found out.

I mean, was I gonna let this destroy
our baby's life?

My whole life...

I've been doing what it takes...

when I love someone.

And I love you.

I love you.

I don't know what to say.

Say, "Love, I get it."

Say, "Love,

we both had to learn how to survive
really young."

I mean, how old were you the first time?

Nine.

I'm so sorry.

You were just a child.

So were you.

So is she.

She?

It's just a feeling.

A daughter. A girl.

I was stupid to think
you would forgive me.

I had to tell myself you would
so that I could go through with it.

But you hate me now.

Love...

If you want to hate me...

run...

turn me in...

hurt me...

just fucking do it.

I'm not gonna keep you here.

Candace said I'd face myself.

Maybe this is it.

Facing you.

This...

It's not covered
in any sort of dating manual.

That's very true.

I understand if you can't love me anymore.

Or don't want to.

I do want to.

Real love doesn't evaporate

when things get hard.

I will earn back your trust.

I will do whatever it takes.

Nothing is more important than this.

Is it weird if I ask if you still want
to go to Lucy and Sunrise's wedding?

âª Got my eyes on the face
of the danger in you âª

So, this is, in fact,
a little weird.

Ellie's not answering.

I can't exactly peel away to look
for her yet.

You don't trust me.

And why would you?
Even I don't know how I feel.

How can I judge anything you've done,

when it was not so different
from the things I've done?

But if I let myself forgive
and just be happy with you,

with all the light and good
that comes with your bad,

what kind of father does that make me?

No! I'm sorry.

- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Gabe! I need to speak to my sister.

Right fucking now!

Okay, then you are gonna
have to call her later.

Is she with Joe?

Will fucking Talented Mr. Ripley?
Okay, look! Listen to me!

She's in danger.

- You are back on the hard stuff...
- I'm sober, you asshole.

Okay, this is a sacred day, and your drama
is not gonna get in the way.

I cannot deal with... No, Forty!

Look, hey, Forty!

- God! Your sober coach...
- Love!

...will be here in ten.

With love, Forty, grow up.

Yeah, crack again.

Fuck you.

Can't fix everyone.

Love makes you do some crazy shit.

Like move across the country
for a girl you barely know,

who already has a girlfriend...

No one could accuse you
of being cold, Love.

Of having no heart.

I remember the first time I saw you
at work.

You were screaming at a studio exec,
like some goddess of destruction,

and I was like...

"She scares me.

She will burn it all down
for what she cares about."

That's the moment I saw what
and who you are.

It's also the moment
I fell in love with you.

My queen,

together we will raise children
who fear nothing.

Whose hearts are the size of the moon.

And who are real and true.

Like you.

All I've ever wanted is to love
and be loved by someone real and true.

Me too.

You're my soulmate.

- Yes, I am.
- Beautiful.

Is that what we are?

- Soulmates?
- I love you, baby.

Is this what real love is?

Knowing and accepting anything.

I love you so much.

- Your vows are better than mine.
- No, they weren't!

- I mean it.
- I mean it.

Well, by the power vested in me

by the Divine Mother
and the state of California,

I now pronounce you...

married.

Ah!

Go on, kiss her. Come on!

- Do it!
- Kiss her!

We're having a little girl together.

I am terrified,
but maybe that's how every parent feels.

All I know is,
I can't protect her if I'm not there,

and I won't be there if I can't love you.

What?

I love you.

You do?

Yes.

Still?

More.

Close the store and leave.

- It's the middle of the day.
- Calvin, just...

put up a "closed for inventory" sign
and get the fuck out.

Whatever you say.

Yeah, thanks for the tone. You're fired!

Good.

As a courtesy, I'll evacuate everyone

before their pathetic junkie boss
fires them, too.

Oh, my!

Okay, okay, okay, you jerks.
You can totally turn on your phones now,

and if we could gather
for the most gorgeous cake

you've ever seen in your life,

courtesy of Ms. Love Quinn.

Yeah!

Okay, I'll go in, calm him down a little.

Give me five minutes
then follow me, okay?

Five minutes. Trust me.

Ellie.

Ellie, I've been worried.

Don't come near me!

What's going on?
Did Forty say something crazy about me?

Because he's been doing that all day.
He's not in his right mind.

You know me.

Please, I can help.

I don't know where to go.

Cops are sending CPS to my house.

Forty told me to meet him here,

but he's in there ranting
on Love's voicemail,

- and he's scary.
- It's okay.

- Love and I are gonna take care of that.
- He's ranting about you,

saying you killed Beck,

and that you tried burying
someone named Candace alive.

Does that sound like me?

- Why would he think that?
- He's high.

Where is my sister, Will?

I don't care about the rest of it,
I don't.

Where is Delilah?

- Did you hurt her, Will?
- No.

Then where is she?

Ellie, this is my fault.

The Quinns are very powerful,

and they get away with evil things.

I got wrapped up with them...

and so did your sister.

So, what?
They're, like, out of The Godfather now?

Ellie,
I don't think Delilah is coming back.

- What?
- I wish it was any other way,

but we need to protect you
and get you away from them.

- My sister...
- Is gone.

You cannot go home.

CPS is not great either.

Come with me.

- Look, you need to go.
- Okay, breathe.

- No, listen.
- You're a little worked up.

- Sit down!
- No, for the last time, I'm not high!

I'm... I'm not.

Is Joe...

Did you read my texts?

You can't even finish a thought.

No, okay, Love. I will say this nicely,

I will do breathwork with you later.

I have to save you from
a literal fucking serial killer first.

I'm handling it.

Please, go.

Okay.

I trust you. Whatever you want, I'll go.

But before I do,

just for my peace of mind...

walk me through the plan?

Okay, take this.

Go out the side doors
in case someone follows you.

Go to Union Station, get on a train east.

Keep going east, okay?

- When you get where you're going, call me.
- Where am I going?

- To start your life.
- I have a life.

Ellie, you are one of the smartest people
I've ever met.

- You can do this.
- Do what?

Start over.

Find a city.

- Florida might be a good place to start.
- I'm 15.

Basically 16, right?

When you get there,
I will help you get legal ID.

I will send you money
as long as you need it.

I will not abandon you.

- Then what the fuck is this?
- This is what we need to do!

I hate you.

You brought the Quinns into our lives,

and you're the reason Delilah's gone.

Dead, right?

She's dead?

I'm sorry, Ellie.

And now you come in here
acting like some kind of hero?

Well, fuck you. Fuck you!

I am not a hero. Believe me.
You want the truth?

I killed Henderson,

and I don't feel guilty about it.

What I am is all that stands between you
and people who are worse.

Now let me help you.

You ruined my life.

I am truly sorry. Side door.

Burn in hell.

She should hate me.

But as long as she's safe.

Is this what fatherhood feels like?

Why are you protecting him?

Why aren't you listening to me?

Because you let people
get in your head, Forty.

No... no.

I have cracked this, okay?
I can see the Matrix,

and it is exactly what Candace tried
to tell us.

Look around him.

People disappear.

People die in weird fucking ways.

First, it was Beck and her friends,

and now Ellie's sister is missing.

Henderson was murdered,
and we had just been at his house.

- All right? Look, Candace told...
- Candace was crazy!

Listen to yourself,
you sound like a conspiracy nutjob.

You have blind spots.

Joe, he's in your blind spot.

He is a blood-thirsty wolf
in your blind spot.

Joe, you're late.

- Come in.
- Joe, you can just wait outside...

No, no.

I insist.

Here's the deal. Our family,
we can make your life a living hell.

We can get you sent to prison.
And we can do a lot fucking worse.

Okay, well, I don't know what it is
you think I did,

so tell me, and we can talk about it.

Which part? The part
where you have a pattern of lying

and stalking and killing in general?

Or the part where you fixated
on my sister?

I will never hurt Love.

- You are never going to get to.
- Okay, this is enough.

Okay? Joe, we can let him simmer down.

- No, Forty!
- Hey!

- Stand back.
- Oh, my God. Put that away!

- Don't be insane!
- This is the sanest I have ever been.

You protect me, I protect you.

Forty... let's talk.

Joe, if you take another step,
I will shoot you.

Love, for the last time, go.

You don't want to hurt him.

Yes, I do.

And if you would listen to me,
you would understand why I have to.

Forty, if you do this,
I will never forgive you.

You will never see me again

or the baby.

Our baby.

A little girl.

- You're...?
- Yeah.

Do you actually think
I would let Joe near me

if I didn't think, in my heart,

that he was worthy of being a part
of our family?

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You would bring a child
into this world like... like us?

- That is your shitty self-esteem talking.
- No.

You are just as broken as I am.

You're just a much better liar.

Jesus, Love...

you think I don't know?

After all of these years,
you really think that I am that dumb?

That I don't know what you're capable of?

I have tip-toed around it my entire life,

and it has eaten me alive.

I love you,

but you are crazy

if you think that you would be
a good mother.

Forty, don't punish your sister
because you're angry with me.

You're right,

I have done terrible things...

in the past.

What I care about now is her

and our child

and you.

You think...

that knocking up my sister
makes you a new person?

No.

I don't.

- No.
- Get on your knees, psycho.

Forty...

Dostoevsky contended
the bad want to be punished.

- Forty, please.
- Stay back, Love.

I said, stay back.

If the bad are not caught,

they'll seek out their own punishment,

one way or another.

Close your eyes, Joe.

At least some punishment is quick.

Oh, no.

Oh, no.

And some punishment will never end.

Are you two okay?

Oh, my God.
If I was one second later...

Officer involved in a shooting. Man down.

Send an ambulance to Anavrin.
I need a sergeant to respond.

- Forty...
- I saw the moment you knew...

your brother was gone,

and I saw you look at me.

I knew, in that moment,
that you needed me

like I've never been needed,
and you always will.

Sometimes, a man gets exactly
what he wishes for,

and that can be
the most perfect punishment of all.

No!

No!

So, karma and I, we're in a fight.

Some people, they get what they deserve.

Some people don't.

And each day that passes,

justice seems more and more
like a literary conceit.

In Crime and Punishment,
the hero willingly walks into exile.

He is killed, but he's also found love.

And if he repents, he can be redeemed.

He and the woman he loves can be saved.

You can't save someone from
themselves. We wanted to... with Forty.

The grief was rough at first,

but his last gift to me
was when heroic Officer Fincher

started to look at him
for Henderson's murder.

The Quinn machine shut it down,
made any future investigation radioactive.

Side effect wiped my slate clean.

Not that the real slate can ever be clean.

But it's hard to stay sad...

when there's new life growing.

And here I am.

No one can absolve me.

I gotta do the time.

Not every Siberia is cold.

Some are 73 and sunny
with eco-conscious landscaping.

I'm ready to meet my daughter.

I'm ready to be the good father
I never had.

To make the family I always dreamed of.

The one she deserves.

It's funny how fate works.

I had no idea that the cage I was building
all this time was a trap for me.

And when I found myself here, locked in,
I thought this was the end.

But that's not how destiny
works, is it?

This is just the beginning...

because this is where I had to be,
exactly...

where I had to be to meet...

you.

There you were,

with your books and your sunshine.

So close, but worlds away.

I will figure out a way,
a way to get to you.

See you soon... neighbor.

Subtitle by Matheus Modesto

.......... ********** ..........

I've always believed in The One.

That there's someone out there for me.

A perfect match, a soulmate.

And for The One, I would do anything.

I've had my heart broken more than once.

Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

And things haven't always
been easy in my life.

What did you do?

But all that felt worth it
when I met Love Quinn.

I wolf you.

I loved her.

I embraced all of her,
even the hard parts.

All you ever have to do is keep
your brother safe. You failed.

But I was wrong... about Love.

Find a city. When you get there,
I'll help you get legal ID,

I will send you money, not abandon you.

Burn in hell.

And by then, it was too late.

We can be together now.

I don't think we can.

- Really, really, truly.
- No, I'm pregnant!

And then I realized
who I really need to protect.

Our daughter.

For her, I moved to some soulless,

wealthy suburb outside San Francisco.

For her, I'd marry the monster,
her mother.

For her, I'd lock myself into this prison.

Not sure how I'm ever going
to get us both out.

But there's one part of the old me
I can't quite shake.

I still believe in The One.

That the right person is out there for me.

I never thought to wonder
what happens after boy gets girl.

'Cause we know:

"And they lived happily ever after."

Fade to black, roll credits.

I should have asked more questions.

'Cause I've been in
some harrowing situations in my life.

But this?

I could really use a map.

Joe. Joe.

That's your cue.

It's time to cut the umbilical cord.

But I've forged my way
in the dark before, I can do it now.

I have to.

To protect my daughter.

Congratulations, Dad. It's a boy.

- It's a boy?
- Hey.

- Hi.
- I'm fucked.

And so is he.

- Careful. Careful.
- And what's our future president's name?

Henry.

Does he have a middle name?

Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

We were told it would be a girl.

Oh, probably just shy.

- Kept the goods hidden.
- Karma. God owed us a boy.

As I was saying, fucked.

Now that the baby's here,

at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.

We moved to Madre Linda
for the schools, after all.

When that patented NorCal fog burns off,
you can see for miles.

Miles of nosy neighbors,
peering suspiciously

from behind lawn care equipment
and video doorbells.

But, hey, safest neighborhood
in the Golden State.

And who wouldn't sell their soul for that?

We have everything.

So he has everything.

The perfect family,
funded by Quinn blood money.

We wanted to get here all on our own.

You compromise when you have to,
when it's for them.

Welcome home, Forty.

Maybe we can use his real name.

We're a family.

Me, a boy and his mom,
who is usually great

but occasionally murders people
with her bare hands.

What could go wrong?

We've barely left the house
since that drive home from the hospital.

âª But this life is shit
And I just don't want it... âª

âª I hate to be a buzzkill... âª

I'd imagined parenthood would feel
like an essay by Nicholson Baker.

Tiny moments made magnificent.

Yeah.

âª "Good things happen
To people that are bad" âª

Or maybe a novel
by Louisa May Alcott.

Hard work but rewarding. Noble, even.

- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

âª I don't wanna be a buzzkill âª

âª I hate to be a buzzkill... âª

Turns out,
parenthood is Groundhog Day

as written by Jean-Paul Sartre.

Joe.

Despite living in some Greek myth

about pushing a boulder
of baby poop up a hill,

it's incredible, the urge to protect.

I feel it in my bones.
I would do anything for him.

"I thought of Gatsby's wonder
when he first picked out

the green light
at the end of Daisy's dock.

He'd come a long way
to this blue lawn, and it..."

It's okay.

What I don't feel is connection.

The more I try to bond, the more he cries.

He knows we don't have it.

- You okay?
- I'm fine.

"I'm fine" is code
for "nipples are bleeding,

hormones still a mosh pit,

haven't slept in six months,
and have not begun to process

the death of my brother."

I'm here. Where's my perfect boy?

Look what Glamma got Forty.

Also not processing Forty's death,

Glamma Dottie,
who got a condo 30 minutes away.

Mom, his name is Henry.

Well, Henry smells like he needs a change.

I'll do it. If you just, uh...

take a few photos for my feed.

- Okay.
- Though she is chronicling her grief

extensively on Instagram.

And her shaman officially confirmed
that Henry is Forty, reincarnated.

Given how ecstatic he is
when she comes around

and how, well, not with me,
Dottie's Shaman might be right.

At least I have a small remnant
of my former life.

There's no bookstore
in this circle of hell,

but I found willing buyers online.

And I send the profits to Ellie...

whenever I hear from her.

On the rare occasion
we do venture into the wild, Forty...

No, no. Henry inevitably cries
before we're handed our lattes.

Aw.

My twins had an oral fixation
for the record books.

Sherry, by the way.

As in, locally famous momfluencer
Sherry Conrad.

Her blog slash podcast slash brand,
Heart-Shaped Mistakes...

Kill me... is a mecca
of humblebragging and superiority

fronting as hard-earned wisdom.

- I'm Love.
- Quinn-Goldberg?

- And this is Joe?
- Yeah.

And Mr. Handsome here is Forty, is it?

- Henry. It's Henry.
- Crazy it's taken months for us to meet.

Yeah. Well, newborn, you know.

Oh, my God. I completely understand.

Glad we're able to run into each other.

We gotta get coffee together, Love.
I'll share all my secrets.

That tone,

warm with an undertone
of Peach-level condescension.

You're doing great. Bye.

Thanks. Bye.

Like I need her approval. What the fuck?

She's lucky I didn't stab her
in the eye. Let's go.

Thing about trying
to keep a human infant alive,

you can't afford to think too hard
about who you're in the trenches with.

I'm in the trenches with a woman

who jokes about stabbing someone
in the eye,

- but is actually perfectly capable of it.
- Want some?

Mm. Thank you.

I don't let myself think
about who Love is, what she is.

My job is to be a good husband
so I can be a good father.

Hey, Natalie!

Hi.

I don't get what her problem is.

- What? Who?
- Our neighbor, Natalie.

She didn't give us a housewarming gift,
nothing when Forty was born.

Henry. Henry.

Yeah, I think you're right.
She seems a little off.

What, did I kiss you wrong? Or...

No, no, I'm just tired.

And this place is a mess.
And Sherry just said to my face...

- basically, that I'm a mess.
- She's an idiot. Just lie down.

I'll take care of this, take care of him.

Shh.

And there he goes.
Every time I touch him.

Just fucking let me do it, Joe. Joe. Joe.

It's fine.

Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

Hey, hey, hey.

Why does my own child not like me?

You know, babies can tell
when your heart's not in it.

- I... What...?
- No. I'm sorry. It's all in my head.

Go fuck yourself.

Love's right.
My heart's not really in it.

How could it be when you stole it?

Love?

Hey, uh...

we're running low on diapers,
so I'll be right back.

Honestly, you're what's gotten me
through this imprisonment.

The green light at the end of my dock.

Knowing you feel the same as I do.

Hello, neighbor.

I don't want it
to happen here like this.

I want you some place luxurious.
You deserve that.

The car is fine. Shut up and kiss me.

Did you just read my mind?

- Hey, neighbor.
- Hi, Natalie.

You must be so under-slept.
I hear your baby crying all the time.

- Oh.
- No, no. Babies cry. Just...

I get why you might be sleeping
in a grocery store parking lot.

Here. I thought I'd save you a trip.

You've been watching me too.

- Thank you.
- One more thing.

Don't believe the bullshit
about breastfeeding preventing pregnancy.

My sister got knocked up so fast.

Friends tell friends. So...

Are you flirting with me?

Sure, the condom thing may be
a little joke from a neighbor

with a mild taste for stirring the pot.

Just friendly. Very friendly though.

Exciting as that is, I have to be careful.

I can't just walk out of this web.
The spider has my child.

Also, truth? I've made...

mistakes in the past.

Would you be a mistake?

Who are you?

- Where are you going? Great, feed Henry.
- Oh, just...

I got winded going up ten stairs.
I need to hit a gym.

Shit.

Whenever I hang with Henry,
I'm reminded of two things.

One, he hates me.

Two, I have to protect him at all costs
from what happened to me.

Joey!

- Where's your mama now?
- Run, you little bitch!

- Run, you little bitch!
- Come get some.

- What are you scared of?
- Get him!

Come on, Joey!

Open the door.

- You freak!
- Come get what's coming to you.

- Boys! What's going on here?
- Teacher! Run!

Boys! What did...?

Hey, hey. Joe, Joe. Let me in.
Hey, it's me, it's me. Let me in.

Dude, you okay?

Bro, why do you do this to yourself?

- They're the ones who do it.
- You asked for it.

- Quit saying your mom's coming back.
- She is.

If she cared, would you be here?

- You don't understand.
- Fine.

Just shut up about it, okay?

- I don't see why...
- The rest of us are trying to deal

with how no one fucking wants us.

Face it. When our parents gave us up,
they threw us away forever, man.

Natalie!
Oh, my God, look at this place!

Who are you?

On the surface, a realtor,
and you're good at it.

You wanna make things lovelier.

You left college early
when you met your husband,

tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,

about whom there is even less to learn

unless I wanna take the word of publicists

paid to manicure every inch
of his online footprint.

Is this what you wanted?

Marry someone older, busy, never home

while you sell houses to rich assholes

and pick up his dry cleaning?
Is that love for you?

Do you love him?

Do you long for something deeper, true?

Like I do.

- I know.
- I think someone...

- Like, I think maybe...
- Oh, Love Quinn!

Come hither.

- Hi.
- Hi. This is Kiki, and this is Andrew.

- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

Love's gorgeous baby boy is,
what, seven months?

- Yeah.
- Oh, I miss that age.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love, I was glad to see you in class.

- Fucking kicked my ass.
- Oh, I know.

That class is for really fit people,

but you'll get used to it.

- I had so much baby weight to lose.
- Same. I had quite the journey.

I mean, much worse than yours.

It was. It really was.

Is it just me
or is everyone calling me fat?

- Oh, oh, no.
- No, no, no.

And would that even be a pejorative?

I mean, beauty doesn't have a size, Love.

Come latte with us.

- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

Okay.

- Yeah, I could go for some coffee.
- Amazing.

Great! We got a group.

I might not have solved
the mystery of you yet,

but I know one thing:
I wasn't wrong to be intrigued.

Forgive the pun.
This speaks volumes about you.

I didn't even know
this hell-burb had a library.

Libraries represent
the very best of civilized society,

the housing of an egalitarian access
to knowledge.

It's what separates us from the apes.

And yet, it physically hurts to see
the condition of most of these books.

Mr. Mooney once said
the way a society treats its books

is the most accurate harbinger
of its fate.

You see enough broken bindings,

you know that Rome's burning
or will be soon enough.

But there's still something to fight for
in this wretched world.

Oh, what's little man's name?

- Oh, it's Henry.
- I dated a Henry.

- Henrys are great.
- Well, Henry thanks you.

Excuse us.

Hard to be invisible
with the greatest lady magnet

in the history of the species
strapped to you.

The Fifth Season, Gone Girl, Seabiscuit.

Okay, I'm stumped. Why those?

Who are you?

Oh, Henry, okay.

All right, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

- Hi.
- So are you gonna chase after her,

- or could I help you with something?
- Yeah.

- I'd like to apply for a library card.
- You've come to the right place.

Good.

Fill that out for me.

We have a great kids section
just in the corner.

And... you can take that home with you.

Natalie picked it out for you.

You are flirting with me.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

When they start to crawl,
it's a miracle anyone survives.

I'm so blessed
we have three incredible nannies.

Oh, my God.
It's twice as insane with twins.

It's kind of why I started writing.
To just share.

So others won't make
the mountain of mistakes I did.

Yeah. What is the name of your blog again?

Oh, she's Heart-Shaped Mistakes.

- You seriously haven't read it?
- No.

- It's small.
- She invented momfluencing.

- Don't be humble.
- No. It's fun.

I can stay home with my twins.
What do you do for work?

- Well, I used to... I'm trained as a chef.
- Oh.

Yeah, and I, uh...

I haven't really had much time
since he was born, I guess.

- Well, yes.
- Your job right now is to connect

with your baby and your man.

So easy for you to say.
Has your vagina even recovered yet?

- Oh, my God. You're embarrassing her.
- Don't be vagina-phobic.

God! I wish someone would've told me.
Sex is hard to get back into.

- But connecting intimately? So crucial.
- Mm-hm.

Endorphins, oxytocin,
it's incredible for the breast milk.

In fact, if you're not orgasming,

your breast milk isn't doing it
for your baby's precious growing brain.

- Well, we're all over that, so...
- Oh.

Okay.

Tender Is the Night is widely
considered Fitzgerald's darkest work.

It's about marriage and infidelity.

Invitation? Or a warning?

- Okay. I finally got him down.
- Mm. Good work.

And I got you...

a pain au chocolat.

Don't get me wrong.
This isn't some German fairy tale

where a witch keeps me locked up
till it's time to eat me.

Love is nice, giving.

I fell in love
with a certain version of her.

What do you think?

- It's okay.
- Exactly. This is the best bakery in town?

Shoddy lamination. Too sweet.

- Definitely didn't use French butter.
- Yeah. Yeah, banish them.

Off with their heads. Done.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Am I interrupting your reading?

- No, no. No, you're not.
- Seems like I am.

- Just come back. Come back, Love.
- Fuck.

- Stay. Stay.
- No, Joe. Why?

- Why won't you talk to me?
- What? We talk...

Something is going on.
You're always distracted.

- I'm not distracted.
- Why won't you tell me?

I've got him.

I'm gonna take him to his grandma's.

- Love.
- No, don't worry about it, Joe.

Enjoy the quiet.

Where are you?

- Hello.
- Hey, neighbor.

Care for a drink?

How'd you get my number?

My husband, Matthew, works in tech.

So...

not at all invasive tech.

Why are you nervous?

Got some checkered past
you're trying to hide?

No, I'm not worried about me so much as...

you know, the future of civilization.

Ah.

Well, that's a lost cause.

You know, I feel I should warn you.

There's no such thing
as privacy in Madre Linda.

Including here.

See.

All the cameras in my house.

One out here is broken. That's why
I spend so much time by the pool.

It's the only place in this entire town
I don't feel like I'm being watched.

Boop. Boop.

There.

You want us to be alone?

Even that's not really privacy.

Matthew will see I turned them off
and wonder why.

It's so weird,
I don't remember putting on a leash,

just kind of...

slipped around my neck at some point.

You're a prisoner too.

I guess
marriage isn't really built for secrets.

Or people aren't really built
for marriage.

Come with.

I need another drink.

To new friends.

"Who can often have
a better time together than old."

- You got my book.
- Hmm.

- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

Here. Is that okay? Can I see it?

Aye. Just put pressure on it.
That should stop the bleeding.

Do you have a first aid kit?

Yeah.

It feels right.

Taking care of you.

There. I think you'll live.

- Does it hurt?
- Nothing more wine won't cure.

You feel it too, don't you?

What?

That feeling
when you're first with someone.

All the tension, possibility...

I wish I could bottle it.

It's better than anything.

I feel it.

I thought it would stay, with Matthew.

Do you think it inevitably goes away?

I think if it's right...

it stays.

So how long did it stay with you and Love?

It's hard to say. Um...

I didn't know the real her...

when I fell in love.

- I know how that feels.
- I got swept up.

By the time I realized, it was too late.

I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave her.

People leave all the time.

Not Love.

Our daughter... We thought
we were gonna have a little girl.

Anyway...

I'm in it now...

with Love.

Are you?

Kids aren't handcuffs.

Matthew has a stepson.

- We don't see him much.
- That sounds terrible, for the kid.

It's fine, actually.

You know why?

People are happier
when they aren't lying to themselves...

and everyone else.

So, what are you doing here?

- I can't leave him either.
- Oh!

I can't do that to him.

Even if it means I stay in this...

Dwell Magazine, Twilight Zone
fucking purgatory forever.

- Is it that bad here?
- Ha.

If you're not careful,

you'll start caring about private schools,

stock portfolios,
start reading on a Kindle.

Fuck.

You wanna see my reading room?

We've always slept in separate rooms.

I'm an insomniac.

Also, a slob.

Everything suddenly feels real.

I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

Hey, where'd you go?

Get out of your head.

Come here.

No. Husband, father. I can't.

I'm sorry.

I gave you the wrong impression.

- I'm pretty sure you didn't.
- No.

I'm just looking for a friend.

Shit.

No, never again.

I promised myself I would do this right.

Love. Hey, I thought...

I got there...

and then I thought about seeing my mom,

and I went and got HÃ¤agen-Dazs instead.

Are you okay? You look a little flushed.

I just had a drink with the neighbor.

- Hmm.
- You're right. She's crazy.

Look, I'm sorry for running off.

I just...

I was just thinking about our vows.

Oh. Yeah.

The ones we wrote on In-N-Out bags
on the way to the courthouse.

You said you would always share a bite
of your pastry with me.

That's... That's so generous.

- I am generous.
- You really are, and I'm an asshole.

- No, you're not. You're just...
- I am. And it's been so crazy.

And I was just thinking about that bite.

And you were hungry?

- Yeah.
- Me too.

That feeling you wanna bottle,

turns out, it can come back.

Maybe this is what we were looking for
in each other, Natalie.

What I needed from you.

A way back to Love.

Maybe, thanks to you,

I can make this work.

I should have told Sherry we were busy.
This is gonna suck.

Something tells me
she's not someone you say no to.

It'll be fine.

I have you...

and pie.

- Quinn-Goldbergs.
- Hey.

- Step right on up.
- Here you go. This is for you.

- It's gluten-free.
- Oh, great.

Yes.

Fun fact,
Sherry had to post an apology video

in August 2020 after it was discovered

that she had a massive party
while the rest of us were home,

clutching hand sanitizer.

Rumor was, the whole neighborhood got
a secret vaccine

manufactured for the Queen of England
and were thus immune to COVID.

I don't believe in conspiracies,

except when they're about
unfair advantages of being rich.

Those are true.
Trust me, I married a Quinn.

Go get you some Pinot.
It's from my friends' winery.

They 3D-print their wine barrels.

Hi.

Thank you.

Oh, that's Kiki and her husband, Brandon.

And there's Andrew and his lawyer husband.

I can't remember his name.

Jackson.

Andrew, Jackson. Now, that is unfortunate.

Oh, my God.

- How could I forget?
- They seem okay,

if you discount the obscene
one-percenter bubble they live in.

Mm. I have to discount that
or we'd have to guillotine both of us too.

Then they're a nice couple.

Contrary to our gracious host.

Never trust a queen bee.

Let me show you around, Love.

- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

Ah, you must be Joe.

Finally, we meet. Cary Conrad.

'Cause is your life even a brand
without a perfectly imperfect soulmate?

Oh, my God.

Mission accomplished. I cannot tell
who the bigger douchebag is.

- Nice to meet you.
- Let me show you the grill setup.

Okay.

A sea of awkward nerds made good.
Tech made the money, wives did the rest.

Clothes, hair, Barry's Bootcamp,

and they go from kid-stuffed-in-locker
to 21st-century master of the universe.

- It's kind of sweet.
- Kiki tells Dakota, "Don't bother Daddy.

He's micro-dosing ketamine.
It's his special time."

If you overlook the haze
of narcissistic delusion

that just the right biohack,

you'll live forever.

It's all paleo. Well, keto, really.

I find when I I.F.,
I'm good on any amount of fats.

- I.F.?
- Intermittent fasting.

You don't?

Well, I mean, obviously you must not
because you're genetically blessed.

Let me get in there.

Oh, yeah.

Lucky. Super high metab.

The guys come and train with me.
I'm a monster. You'll love it.

Is he flirting with me
or inviting me to join Fight Club?

Help yourself to meat.

I'll be back.

I didn't know
Lena and Chris were back from Paris.

Oh, and apparently had the best time.

- They're open, the marriage.
- Oh.

No judgment from me.

Really?

- None?
- I spent my summers growing up

on a commune,
so I got a big dose of all that.

Whatever works, right?

You are such a breath of fresh air, Love.

I'm glad you moved here.

- My pleasure.
- Oh.

Hi.

Natalie and Matthew Engler.

- Oh, she looks amazing.
- She is a bad person.

Matthew was married
to this incredible woman named Mimi,

mother of his child, and then, well...

He met Natalie, and...

We're far too feminist
to ever say a woman stole a man.

She's nice enough.
Great realtor, you know. A cheater.

Good to know
when a person lives next door.

Mm-hm.

Oh, I must say hello to Les.
He's sourcing us a French bulldog.

- I'm empty. I'm gonna go fill up.
- Okay.

You're here, with him?

Looking perfectly content.

Was our evening nothing?
A mistake for us both?

Ever sat in a virtual reality pod?

- Joe?
- No, I can't say that I have.

Oh, Cary's got one in his garage.
It's insane.

Not even just for porn.
But also the porn is spectacular.

We as a species
deserve to go extinct.

So my friend Rachel in L.A.,

she said the brother's a crackhead
who got himself killed.

And the dad's shady too.
Apparently, Anavrin is a front.

Money just papers over that garbage fire.

And, of course, she took her daddy's cash,
bought a whole new life here,

where the rest of us work
for what we have.

- Amen.
- Amen.

Hi.

Can I top off your wine?

- Hi.
- Oh, my God!

Okay.

May I state the obvious?
Sherry Conrad is a terrible person.

- Can you fucking believe that?
- Who runs this town, so...

you kind of can't
get righteously indignant

unless you also wanna be lonely.

Well, I have friends.

Where, in L.A.?

You need some here too.

I assume you came here for the schools?

Well, now, you know those come at a cost.

Pinot, please.

Look, they hate me.

Think I stole Matthew from their friend,
who by the way, was cheating first, but...

Point is,

everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

You mean, around Sherry and her mafia?

It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

They just called my family a garbage fire.
I don't really see that happening.

Okay. Fair.

So do what I do. Get her to respect you.

Authenticity scares the shit out of her.

Do you, no apology, loud and proud,
and you'll cow her into,

if not submission,
at least basic fake friendship.

Okay, great. One problem.
I don't really know who I am these days.

I just had a baby,

and everything's a...

There's nothing authentic
or intimidating about me.

I'm just a stay-at-home mom going insane.

I guess there's some...

things I need to figure out.

So if you could do anything,

what would you do?

Just for fun?

Okay.

So this is stupid.

But I have this fantasy
of opening a bakery.

I'm a trained pastry chef in another life,

and feels ridiculous to think about
in a town where nobody eats gluten.

I eat gluten.

Seriously?

You know what?

There's a space available
that might be perfect.

Could be wrong.

Or this was fate.

Call me if you ever wanna see it.

Thank you.

It's really nice
to have an actual conversation.

I can't believe
we've been living next door for months.

Joe's seen more of you than I have.

Oh, not really.

I keep telling Matthew, I'd love to have
you both over for a drink sometime.

It's crazy, we haven't had
either of you at the house yet.

We'll do it soon.

Yeah, that sounds great.

Definitely.

What is wrong?

I have been doing everything
for this family,

and you've been fucking the neighbor.

- What? Wait, what are you talking about?
- I'm not an idiot, Joe!

I'm not having an...

Look, I don't know what she said,
but I told you the truth.

We had a drink.
She started acting a little crazy. I left.

Then you came home and fucked me
for the first time in six months.

- What is that? A coincidence?
- Fine. I like that she flirted.

Is that what we're doing now?
Policing each other's minds?

- Are we not allowed to have a fantasy?
- Don't give me that.

There's nothing simple about it
when somebody gets stuck in your mind.

- I don't care if you fucked her.
- Sounds like you care.

Are you obsessed with her?

- It's not like that.
- Really?

- Yeah.
- You sure?

I'm sure. Because it was like that
with you, Love! I married you.

The man I fell in love with would do
anything for the ones he loves.

I still would. I moved here.

We're in this fake, plastic suburban hell.

- We moved here for the baby.
- He was supposed to be a girl.

What does that fucking matter?

I don't even... I... I don't... It doesn't.

It feels so emblematic
of getting it wrong,

of feeling like I am gonna
fuck him up. Like he knows.

He looks at me like I'm a monster.

How do you think I feel?

You remember what Forty said.
Five seconds before he died.

That I'd be crazy if I ever thought
I could be a good mother.

Well, he was out of his mind.

Maybe he wasn't.

We...

both...

have done bad things.

I wanted to move here so that...

we could start new...

be safe and never have
to do anything bad ever again.

We get to choose.

We get to choose. We are safe now.

We're together.

I promise, no more.

No more bad things ever again, okay?

While we're telling the truth,

you are a great mother.

Thanks.

Does that mean
I can stop reading Sherry's shitty blog?

There's still time to bond with him.

Try reading him something
other than Fitzgerald. He is a baby.

Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

Should we go home?

Yeah, let's go home.

- Hey, are we okay?
- Hey.

- He's been great all night.
- Okay.

Go get some rest. I got him.
Really. I got him. I got him.

- Thank you, thank you.
- Good night.

- Thank you, thank you.
- I love you, Forty.

Oh.

You're okay, Henry.

"Happily ever after" looks
a lot different than I thought.

And a family, the reality of one,

might not be for everyone...

but it's all I've ever wanted.

So I'm gonna make this work.
No matter what it takes.

Goodbye, you.

Nineteen bucks? It's crazy.
I'll give you 2 bucks.

This isn't a pawnshop, sir.
We don't negotiate late fees.

Manager. I wanna speak to a manager.

Hi, Natalie.

Yep.

Yeah, I wanted to see that place
you were talking about for a bakery.

Amazing.

"But he could not think
of a story to tell Frog.

Then...

Uh...

Toad poured a glass of water
over his head."

Am I the asshole here?
I'm sorry. That's a bad word.

Is it me?

I'm trying.

I'm in over my head.

He said, using an idiom
his son will never understand

because it's impossible
to communicate with babies.

Yeah, right. Exactly.

How are we supposed
to understand each other?

How am I supposed to do this right?

I wanna do this right, Forty...

Henry. Henry.

Henry, you see?

You're getting into my head.

I'm gonna do everything I can.

I just don't know what that means yet.

I...

So wait, you don't hate me?

Yeah, same here.

Same here.

Okay. Yeah, it's a good talk.

Yeah, let's keep reading.

Uh...

"'Why are you pouring water
over your head?' asked Frog.

'I hope that if I pour water over my head,
it will help me to think of a story.'"

It's cute, right?

Build-out's already mostly done for you.

And the tenant left all the appliances?

Kind of had to.

Look, I'm not gonna lie.

This town isn't exactly
the easiest market.

Your stuff has to be good.

- That, I'm not worried about.
- Then nothing to worry about.

Except landlord has another offer.

But he loves me, so sign
a 3-year lease today and you're golden.

I already sent you papers to e-sign.

- Can I...? Can I see downstairs?
- Yeah, let's go.

Okay, so I know how it looks,

but I was told this is
the best walk-in freezer on the market.

Let me show you the other storage room.

Permits are easy.

So you can have
this place up and running crazy fast.

Bottom line, in the right hands,
this place could be a raging success.

So, what do you think?

This is just the beginning, Henry.

Frog and Toad are great. But wait
until you meet Pippi Longstocking.

You'll freak out.

I'm just leaving the library. What's up?

Hey, Love. You okay?

Um, Joe.

What's wrong?

I think we need to go to couples' therapy.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

Henry Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

We're a family.

Now that the baby's here,

at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.

Hey, Natalie. Hi.

My heart's not really in it.

How could it be when you stole it?

No. Husband, father. I can't.

Sorry. I'm just looking for a friend.

Everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

Even around Sherry and her mafia?

It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

- I have this fantasy of opening a bakery.
- There's a space available.

Call me if you wanna see it.

Natalie. I wanted to see
the place you were talking about.

You can have this place up crazy fast.

This place could be a raging success.
So, what do you think?

Hey, Love. Hey, you okay?

Joe, I think we need to go
to couples therapy.

So, what brings you in?

- What?!
- Shh. Don't wake him up.

Love, what did you do?

What did you do?

We had a fight.

Obviously.
You wouldn't be here if you hadn't.

Yeah. I caught him cheating.

Good, we're diving right in.

It's okay, Henry. I won't let
anything happen to you, I promise.

Love, I told you, nothing happened.

If anything, she came on to me.

You kept a box.

I know what that means.

I know you.

So you kill her?

Technically, I didn't cheat.

"Technically"?

I caught him about to cheat.
It's the same thing.

The difference is
that I almost did a bad thing

and she did a terrible thing.

I can't say what she did,
so I'm the villain.

I'm not saying I'm blameless.

But she went crazy.

What does that mean, "crazy"?

You're the shrink, that's your job.

She flew off the handle...

and broke a vase.

A vase.

- It was priceless.
- Cheap and tacky.

Impossible to undo.

Don't fight, don't make it worse.
There's no telling how she'll react.

Okay.

I broke a vase.

It's just, sometimes, I get passionate.

What are you doing?

Her phone, Love.
Her trackable, traceable phone.

Did you even think about that
before you buried an ax in our neighbor?

No. No, I didn't plan it
like some psychopath.

I... Fuck.

There's this too.

I, um...

- I signed the lease for the bakery.
- You signed a lease for our crime scene?

Give me this.

I thought it would be good,
a reason I was here with her.

I know there's a mess to clean up,
but I couldn't leave

and let somebody come in here.
And now we have...

- You know, time to cover it up.
- We have no time. There's no time.

I'm not good at this.
You backed me into a corner,

- and I was trying to protect our family...
- Let me focus!

I got it!

So you have a new baby?

- Yeah.
- Yeah, Henry.

- Sometimes we call him Forty.
- His name's Henry.

A good therapist would dig
into why our child is named

after her dead addict brother.

So, Joe, how have you found
the transition to fatherhood?

A tangle of dread and failure.
Oh, and, also, murder.

It's great.

A little challenging.

- For both of us.
- For me more than him.

He's been... and he'd admit...

checked out, going through the motions.

And it's like, "Why...?
Why isn't his heart in it?

And why won't he try?"

- I have been trying.
- You're saying you've been all in?

When you're only truly present
maybe 50% of the time?

Textbook. She'd rather make it
about me and Henry

than look at her part in this.

Okay. Love, we need a story.

A reason she died.

She was unstable and unhappy,

- and she killed herself.
- With an ax?

She fell off a cliff
and hit her head. I don't know!

She needs to disappear.

Shh.

Never to be found, never to be autopsied.

Her phone, her iPad,
her car are impossible to hide.

So we need to move her...

things somewhere
and her body somewhere else.

Okay. Uh...

Where?

There's a state forest

30 minutes from here.

We bury her in the woods.

That worked so well with Candace.

I think, she's been holding
my past relationships against me.

Well, you do have a pattern.

Don't bite, don't bite.

And you don't?

You wanna throw Candace
in my face right now?

Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's talk about how we handled that.

What did you do with her body?
Or Delilah's, for that matter.

- Because you have never shared.
- I told you, I took care of it.

And I am asking you
how you took care of it.

It's safer if you don't know, okay?

Shit! Okay.

You know, in L.A.,
there was this man named Jasper...

who came after me
because of Will Bettelheim's debts.

And he needed to disappear.

- What did you do?
- I broke him down into smaller parts.

- How? With, like, a saw?
- Yes.

Also, it was...
You know, eventually, it had to be...

In the end, a meat grinder was the way
to get him in a bag.

At Anavrin?

- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Are you fucking kidding me?

- I used that thing all the time!
- What is your idea?

Do you have a better one?
Of course you don't

because you murdered our neighbor
in a fit of rage.

No regard for the consequences.
This, today, Love, look.

This? You did this.

You put our family in danger, Love.

- Where are you going?
- To take care of the baby.

You can deal with Natalie. You cared more
about her than your own son anyway.

- Shh! It's okay. It's okay.
- I was wrong, Natalie.

I thought you were a threat
to my marriage.

But the real problem
with my marriage is my fucking wife.

- So we don't know where to go from here.
- "You" don't know where to go from here.

He may not know either,
but when you speak in "we,"

you leave no room
for his individual experience or yours.

The "we" is codependence
masquerading as love.

I'm...

- Sorry.
- Don't be.

If you don't know
how to communicate healthily,

it's because it was never modeled for you.

Oh, funny,
it's already "blame-the-parents o'clock."

I'll be honest with you.

I don't think this fight has anything
to do with Joe's so-called cheating.

She doesn't?

- You don't?
- Mm-mm. Not really.

Do you know what it is about?

Not yet. But keep talking.

So why don't you tell me
what you went through, alone,

in the aftermath of the argument.

- Well, I...
- Actually...

I'd like to hear from Joe first.

She would?

Maybe she can sense the inequity here.

Yeah, well, like I said, nothing was ever
going to happen with this woman.

But, after the fight,

I felt obligated...

to get rid of her for good.

"Obligated"?

Forced.

By your wife?

Yes.

How did that make you feel?

Fuck Love. Fuck her. Fuck this.

Fuck whoever made these bags.

Where is that little perforated line?
Which end is it?

I should let Love take the fall for this.
But, no, she knows what I've done.

She knows me. Fuck marriage!

All right, Natalie.

This is the story of your disappearance.

You show my wife the bakery.

She signs a lease.

An hour later, you text your husband.

No emoji, no emotion,
like the rest of your texts with Matthew.

It's terse, all business.

The rental in question is
a cute cabin you manage,

30 minutes out on the border
of the state forest.

Your car, phone, iPad,

and all their invasive
location-tracking technologies will take

a scenic drive to the property.

Your body is headed somewhere else
but more on that in a moment.

Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck my life.

No, no, stop. Reel it in. Think of Henry.

I cannot get this wrong.

The point is, Natalie,

although your stuff will make it
to the cabin, you simply disappear.

Your last text will be to your sister,
suggesting you are deeply unhappy,

leaving plenty of room for interpretation.

Rumor: Did you leave
your cold and distant husband?

Were you abducted? Assume a new identity?
Who can ever say for sure?

And in the event
there are traffic cameras in town...

So you put an end to the other woman
and you feel...

Emasculated.

Here's the problem
my wife left us to clean up.

Natalie, your trackables
and your body need to part ways

somewhere a person would
reasonably pull over if they were alive.

And then, well... Then I need to find
some magically perfect place

to leave you forever.

Burying you in the woods is
the best I've got.

If she wanted it her way,
she should have done the hard part.

This isn't me though.

I put this behind me.

I changed... You know what's funny?

For Love. For her.

Because I wanted to be good enough
for her. And look at me now.

I'm worried about Henry.

I don't recognize Love anymore.

I don't even recognize myself.

Maybe you were on to something, Natalie.

Kids aren't handcuffs.

When I'm done cleaning up Love's mess,
I am packing my bags,

taking Henry and getting the fuck out.

You were going to leave me?

- Are you insane?
- Uh-uh.

No.

You must listen.

I am listening, every word. How...?

There's a difference
between a reaction and a response.

The latter is thoughtful,
the former, impulsive.

Why does everybody think I'm impulsive?

Who is "everybody"?

You know, she's good.

Uh...

Does someone else make you feel like this?

Good morning. Hello?

Hey, Mom.

Hey.

Sleepy Forty.

Aren't you a little gift?

Why didn't you answer my calls?

Oh, I've been busy.

I signed a new lease
on a cute little bakery in town.

- A bakery?
- Yeah.

I need to head to the market.
Can you watch him?

He should be down for a nap.
I need to start stocking the shop.

Hold on. A bakery?

- In a town that's peak keto?
- Yeah, yeah. I will convert them.

I told you
that Quinn family finances were in flux.

We'll figure it out.

As in,

I can't guarantee
I can help you with a lease, financially.

Mom, that is very different
than vaguely mentioning "flux."

It's a three-year lease
with a huge deposit.

I would have told you
if you'd taken the time to ask.

Is this another one of your episodes?

"Episodes"?

You know, it all feels a tad impulsive.

So, what is it about these...

labels that are so hurtful?

Well, it's like...

nobody gets me.

Why I do things, how I do them.

It's like, I just wanna be
a good role model for my child.

And that means doing more.

Stay with the feeling. "Nobody gets you."

Shit. It's hard to stay angry
when she's so... But what's not to get?

She's relatable except for the part
where she's an ax murderer.

Is that gettable? Is it my fault
if I don't want to get that?

Um...

I just remembered this moment at the...

at the store.

- Fuck.
- I got you.

- There you go. You need a...?
- Thank you.

- Need a hand with any of this?
- No, I'm good.

All right.

Shameless.

Yeah.

I'm a fem-gen major
if that's any comfort at all.

It's Feminist Gender
and Sexuality Studies.

So I aim to be fluent.

- Nice.
- Yeah.

I'm Theo, by the way. What's your name?

I'm married.
And half these groceries are for my baby.

Yeah, yeah, if there's one thing
I know about babies,

they really love yeast.

They just guzzle the stuff.

- That's for the bakery I'm opening.
- Oh, shit. Where is it?

- Um, off Main Street, near Town Square.
- Okay.

- Oh, where Sweet Dreams used to be.
- Yeah.

Before that, it was Curry Home for Dinner.

So the pun name is a requisite.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

- You're from here?
- I am, I am.

And you are new in town.

They haven't converted you
to full-time athleisure yet.

Congratulations.

Oh.

Yeah, L.A. runs strong in these veins.

Damn, girl.

So you got a new town, new baby,

new bakery, banging body.

You're just doing it all.

It's a tax.

What were you feeling when
this stranger paid you so much attention?

Guilty.

'Cause it felt so good.

And then really sad

'cause I didn't want that from a stranger.

I wanted that from my husband.

And just like that,
she's the victim again. Masterful.

How does that sit with you?

I'm flattered.

Mm.

Your face tells a different story.

If anything, you seem repulsed.

Dumb, back-stabbing face.

No. What...? No.

No, no, no. Look, I haven't been
as present as I would like...

lately.

Parenthood is an adjustment.

But I'm...

- I'm here, right?
- True.

Maybe being here is already
a radical concession,

given you were on the verge
of leaving for good.

So why didn't you?

Leave her?

Maybe I'll take Henry some place
like this lovely rental cabin of yours.

Pretty, quiet.

You could have helped me vanish, Natalie.
But now... it's time to vanish you.

Your husband won't suspect
you're missing for a day.

All that remains is
a cryptic text to your sister,

then I gotta hike ten miserable miles,
catch a ride home and start packing.

Oh, what's this?

"Tell me I shouldn't fuck
the boring neighbor"?

"Boring neighbor"?

Is that all I was to you?

Is that all you were?

A restless housewife? A stereotype?
Maybe Love was right about you.

No, no, no. She had no right to kill you.
Still, things could've gotten messy fast.

Maybe I would've made a mess.
Maybe Love was right. No, she wasn't.

- Shit.
- It's not a trick question.

Why didn't you run?

Well, because...

I couldn't convince myself
that Henry would be better off.

He needs both of us.

So you stayed for the child,
not for your wife.

Unfortunately, that's our time for today.

I'm giving you homework.

"How to talk."

The reflective listening exercise will
help structure difficult conversations.

Slow down, respond...

- instead of react.
- That's Love's homework.

Mine is to prevent her
from murdering this therapist.

And I'd like to see you
as soon as possible,

given we are in a bit
of a triage situation.

Is it that bad?

You want me to tell you
whether or not you should be together.

The truth is, the easiest thing is
to end this marriage.

Either one of you have
the power to do it tonight.

You must choose to stay together
every minute from now until death,

and that takes a lot of will

and something both of you are willing
to fight for.

So far, I've only heard you fight
to be right.

You need a deeper purpose.

Henry. If nothing else, Love and I...

And don't say "Henry."

If children were enough reason
to stay married,

we'd have no divorced parents.

Shit.

What's the only thing worse
than couples therapy?

Coming home afterward.

Dr. Chandra's "How to talk" worksheet is
mostly about how to listen,

which may be useful if we ever talk again.

Okay, so Sherry's wedding cake
was lemon-raspberry.

So I think that gluten-free, sugar-free,

fucking happiness-free cupcakes,
that should be a safe bet.

Andrew and Jackson's kid's party.

We're still going to that?
Don't you think that...?

Wait. Do you have some packing
and running to do?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me try it again. I'm sorry.

What I'm hearing is that you think

that Natalie and us should be
the only people

who mysteriously
don't attend today's party.

Not better.

- That's not what I'm saying.
- No?

What I'm hearing is that you would
really like some alone time.

So I'm gonna go take Henry
and let you work in peace.

Not what I said.

You two again.

Yes, us again.

There you go.

That was a quick read.

Need me to find another beautiful woman
to recommend the next one?

I already found one.

I was hoping you could show me
the rare books section.

What makes you think we have one?

A dumbwaiter indicates a basement

where a mole-rat person looks after
the valuable books.

But I'm guessing...

We don't have anyone down there right now.

Okay, yeah.

Well, maybe you could escort us.

We'll be very quick.

I promise.

And here we are.

Yikes. These poor books.

You looking for anything specific?

You know what,
I think I'll know it when I see it.

Mind if I take a look?

- Please.
- Okay.

I thought you said
no one worked down here.

Oh, I do, sometimes.

When it's slow upstairs.

Interesting. Keep her talking.

So... you're an artist.

I'm a librarian who draws.

Looks like more than that to me.

Anything other
than Victorian science books down here?

Okay, nosy.

I illustrate books sometimes.

- It's just a side hustle though.
- Bingo.

So is there anywhere that I can see
your work, like online maybe or...?

Why?

- You write a kids' book?
- No, I'm just a connoisseur.

Here we go.

Wildflowers of New York.

Do you need a 100-year-old gardening book
instead of a new one upstairs?

Nothing beats the classics.
I can have this back in a few days.

No. You're not supposed
to take these ones home.

Okay. I can read it upstairs.

I think he should calm down
in just a bit. Right, Henry?

That's okay. Just take it.

- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

Glad someone's got my back.

Less than ideal to steal, of course.

But Ellie needs cash,
and I can't touch Quinn funds

for fear of them finding out where she is.

And let's be honest,
it feels good to fix something.

Especially when everything else feels
so unfixable.

Oh, shit. I knew it, we're late.

What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?

- Is this really the life I want?
- Hi.

- Welcome.
- The only thing worse than a kid's party

is a rich kid's party.

A little bit to the right.

One more.

Oh, you're early.

Hi. Yeah, I...

- We thought that...
- Oh, it's fine. Fine.

Most of the gang's here to help set up.

Um...

Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna put these somewhere.

Hey, boys! Look who's here.

- Hey!
- Yo, Joe! Let's get you drunk!

Stop. But seriously...

- how drunk do you wanna be for this?
- Love!

- We didn't think we'd see you today.
- Oh.

- You left in such a hurry the other night.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry for ghosting.

My mom was watching the baby,
and Dottie has an expiration time.

Alcohol? Pills?

It's no judgment. I could only imagine
what she's been through. Oh!

I could cry right now.
Being a mom of twins...

Losing one would be like... losing both.

I made cupcakes.

- You made those?
- Gorgeous.

Yes. I am also opening a bakery.
A cute little spot on Main Street.

I love that.

So brave.

You've heard
that spot hasn't had much success,

- but it's never had you, mama.
- Yeah.

I was hoping you lovelies would be
my guinea pigs.

Don't worry, they're organic
and, like, everything-free.

They're lemon-raspberry.

You know, I'm not really a fan
of lemon or raspberry.

- Already hit my macro.
- I'm fasting.

Oh!

We should get our kids in their costumes.

Screw your liver.

Seventy percent of G-clearance happens
in the peripheral tissue.

This is what fun looks like
in Madre Linda: glorified productivity.

I want the best for my son.
No denying, this beats a group home,

but there's gotta be
a third bowl of porridge.

Bottom line, 45-minute orgasm.

- No way.
- Sick. I'll invest.

Things I've learned
in the past ten minutes:

ejaculating too much can deplete focus,
so Cary patented "injaculating."

Sherry started nicknaming me
"The Stallion."

And Gil is only
a hair less outsider than me.

Judging by the gasps he gives
every time Cary says the word "ejaculate,"

I'd guess that Gil waited till marriage.

- Daddy! Daddy!
- Thank you, tiny intruder.

Hey. Having fun?
I want you to meet someone.

This is Joe. Joe, this is Zoe. Zoe, Joe.

I've seen you at the library.
I read to the kids there.

You and Henry should join. It's fun.

- We can carpool.
- Maybe.

Rather lose another finger than carpool
with Mormon Neville Longbottom.

So far, nothing about this place
worth fighting for.

- Oh, my God!
- Uh-oh. Sherry's siren song.

Duty calls, men.

Don't eat sugar! Honey, no!

Go ahead. I can watch the little guy.

Yeah? Okay. Thank you.

- Sure, no problem.
- Nice guy.

Maybe I'm still looking
for reasons to run.

Get that... No, baby. Oh, baby girl, no!

You have completely spiked
their blood sugar, Love.

- No, they're sugar-free.
- There's sugar in raspberries.

- We don't let them eat fruit. Come on.
- Oh.

Let's go, babies. This way.

Cary, I am so sorry.

That's fine. They're kids.

Hey, I'll give the wife
a little you-know-what later,

and she'll just lose all memory of this.

Don't worry. I got the twins wearing
those Vital Rings of Matthew's.

Matthew...

See?

Heart rates and blood sugar,
totally normal.

Does this have GPS?

Oh, yeah. Leave it to Matthew.

He could give a shit about your health,
he's just horny for the data.

It's pretty spotty,
but it gives you the general idea.

- We all wear them.
- No.

No, no.

If Matthew has access to Natalie's ring,
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

Do you think they could see
that her heart stopped?

- I didn't invent the fucking ring.
- Stop!

Hey. Hey, man.

No, listen to me.
We need to stop production, then.

He hasn't put it together yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

Natalie's been gone over 24 hours.
Our window is rapidly closing.

- What? Are you bringing him?
- Wanna leave him in the car?

That's Bad Parenting 101.

Witnessing us dig up a body isn't?

He has barely any depth perception,
which you should know.

What I'm hearing is, even as I am doing
everything in my power to save my child,

my parenting skills aren't up
to your standards.

Is this important right now?

Oh, fuck!

Why does she look like that?

I had to remove her teeth.

Right. Dental records. Yeah.

Where did you put them?

The teeth? Don't wanna find them
in a hidey-hole in my house.

You won't. It's safer if you don't know.

- What?
- Might want to wait in the car with Henry.

I can handle it. Just fucking do it.

We'll see.

It's cracked. Maybe that's good.

Could've just broken when...
In the bakery when she fell.

But what if it didn't?

Still have to move it.
The body can't be where the ring died.

- So just...
- Yeah.

I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

What now?

I know where to go.

You said we needed a permanent solution.
We're on the edge of town.

They're pouring a foundation tomorrow.

Under a slab of cement is permanent.

- How did you know we'd rebury her?
- I didn't.

I drove past it yesterday,
so I looked into it. A backup plan.

How many of those do you have?

Do you just drive around
making mental notes

of good places to disappear people?

Considering who I'm married to, yeah.

I kind of have to.

Oh, I'm the psycho.

How did you get rid of her so fast?
How did you know where to go?

- What were you planning for?
- What are you insinuating?

Why is she doing this now?
We have a body to take care of.

If this is a partnership,
I'm better off alone.

- Love?
- Why don't you love me anymore?!

- You know why, you just won't say it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

You had a hook to my throat.
And then I said I was pregnant.

And then we just went on
and pretended like it didn't happen.

No, no, no, we didn't!
It was a bad moment. For both of us.

- It was a bad moment a lifetime ago.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

You act all pure and noble,

like you have reasons
for what you do when you do it.

But when I do it, I'm crazy, right?

I'm some manic nutjob.

"But, oh, wait! Oh, wait!

She's a mom now,
I guess I can't slit her throat."

He... is the only reason I'm alive.

How do you think that makes me feel?
I can't trust you.

I can't trust you either!

I was trying to...

Yes, yes. Yes, I did things.

But I've worked hard to be better
and I am not that person anymore.

But now,

I will be burying bodies
until I'm 70 years old!

Because if I'm not 100% into you
all of the time,

you will keep killing people!

If I'm not enough for you, you'll kill me.

You said that out loud?

I want you to listen closely.

Fifty percent of my married clients want
to kill each other.

It's normal.

And here's the better news,

neither one of you is gonna kill
your spouse.

You're many things,
but you are not murderers.

The intensity here is a very good sign.

You're not fighting to be right,
you're fighting for your lives.

Deeper. Right?

- Scarier.
- Joe.

Can you think of any times
when you felt as violent as you did

toward Love in your fight?

A few.

No, I'm pregnant!

I'm not a violent person.

What if sometimes you are?
What if that's normal?

Stop. Stop!

I don't wanna hurt anyone.

I believe you.

So, what's the feeling under the rage?

Fear.

Fear that...?

Joe, stay with the violent thoughts.

You're broken. I could never love you.

You're crazy!

What did you do? What did you do?

If someone...

sees me...

- Why does she look like that?
- I had to remove her teeth.

If someone sees the real me...

they'll go away.

For good.

What about you, Love?

When else have you felt the way
that Joe makes you feel?

When I feel...

- protective.
- What are you fighting to protect?

- My family.
- Why specifically family?

That's what you do.

What do you get from your family?

I don't know.

A family is supposed to...

love you unconditionally.

Why is that so important?

Why does love have to be unconditional?

Because if anyone...

saw...

how ugly I can be...

They'll go away for good.

Fair to say one of the things
you have in common

is fear of abandonment so deep,
it feels downright kill-or-be-killed.

Metaphorically speaking.

When our patterns line up like this,

it's very, very hard
to see the other person

because it's dangerously close
to looking in a mirror.

We're talking about
the worst things, so why do I feel relief?

So how are we, um...

I'm sorry. Joe and I.

...supposed to make this work?

That's the perfect word.

"Work." Because that's what it takes.

Let go of unconditional.
There's no such thing.

There's agreeing
to show up the best we can.

In the best marriages,

each partner challenges the other
every day

to be a better version of themselves.

- Sounds like a lot of fighting.
- Sure.

But is all fighting bad?

Maybe this isn't two opponents in a ring.

Maybe this is two on the same team

fighting for the same thing.

That sounds good.

Having someone on my... team.

Yeah.

Yeah, that sounds nice.

There you go.

You know what else
they don't tell you about teammates?

The sex is better.

Like, "Don't bother to describe it
to your unmarried friends" better.

The passion fueled by the deepest trust.

And it's fucking primal.

A team.

Is that what this could be?
It does sound really nice.

Love knows me better than anyone ever has.

I'm starting to understand
why that's so terrifying.

Joe. Joe!

- Hey.
- What, what, what?

Look.

Oh.

Oh. Wow.

I think they're the Shermans'.

They put up "lost bunny" signs
the other day.

Look, the mom is protecting her babies.

Look at the bunnies, Henry.
Henry, look at the bunnies.

Must've gone through there.
I had no idea there was a hole.

Henry...

Do you like that?

And just like that, there you are.

The girl... The woman I fell in love with.

Warm, playful, honest,
and beautifully, radiantly maternal.

I'm such a fool. I've been distant, cruel.

How can you ever forgive me?

I'm so sorry about what I said. Um...

Of course you love our son.

Of course that you are all in with him.

It's not just him.

It's not just our son.

This is new.

Exciting.

The joy of being a team.

And I'd be remiss if I didn't admit,

we have an excellent therapist.

I have to tell you something.

I would absolutely kill for you.

Love, I would kill for you too.

And Henry.

Okay, so...

I promise to do everything I can...

to make sure you never have to do that.

I promise too.

Never again.

Thank you.

Love.

There are going to be things
out of our control, so...

I'm thinking about a way we can...

help each other
to make sure we never go there.

We can make a safe space.

A safe space?

It's very therapized.

Mm.

What'd you have in mind?

Even with therapy,
our wounds may take a long time to heal.

We can't just erase our worst impulses.

But maybe we can control them.

âª My heart belongs to only you âª

âª I've never loved as I love you âª

âª You've set a flame
Within me burning... âª

We can't be sure
what or who might come at us,

but I know from experience,
this gives us options.

This offers us time to slow down,
reflect and respond.

It feels nice trusting you
with this part of me.

âª I'll always be your slave, my darling âª

âª Through the coming years... âª

For the most part.

âª There were some times
When I was doubtful âª

âª Of this new love affair âª

âª But now my mind is no more doubtful âª

âª I've found my heaven âª

âª With the help of a prayer... âª

We're putting down roots,
building a future for our son.

âª A melody... âª

You'll dominate
your little corner of this town.

And I...

I'm gonna find mine.

It's time.

- This gonna become an everyday thing?
- I hope so.

What did you do?

I couldn't help but notice
your rare books need some attention, so...

I have expertise in that area.

Oh, so you want a job.

Well, you know you need a Master's
to work in a library, but...

Do you though?

I will think about it.

Thanks.

Cement is set.

We're in the clear.

- Anything from next door?
- Not that I can see.

She's been gone for days.

He's gotta know by now.

I wish I knew what he was thinking.

Hmm. You.

What are you doing here?

I own the place.

Hang on a second.
Theo, who's there?

- Oh, hi, Love.
- Hi, Matthew.

Uh, Natalie's not here right now.

Oh, no, I came here to see you.
I came here to see both of you.

- I did. I brought you some cupcakes.
- Thank you.

Love, this is my son, Theo.

- I didn't know you had a son.
- Stepson from my first marriage.

Thank you, but we're dealing
with something right now.

Let's go.

- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

Have a good night.

So?

So... they know.

Shit's about to hit the fan.

We've got this. Together.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

Love, what did you do?

We bury her in the woods.

Love, this is my son, Theo.

- I didn't know you had a son.
- Stepson from my first marriage.

I got the twins wearing those Vital Rings.

- Does this have GPS?
- We all wear them.

If Matthew has access
to Natalie's ring,

he'll be able to see exactly where she is.

I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

So... they know.

We've got this. Together.

Things are always better in the morning.

At least that's what Scout tells us.

And who am I to argue with Harper Lee?

Then again, Scout didn't help

to cover up the murder
of the next-door neighbor's wife.

Here, in Madre Linda,
safest neighborhood in the Golden State,

every passing morning brings
more attention.

A woman has disappeared.

It's domestic noir come to life,
and people are here for it.

Keep it going.

Hold, hold, hold.

Squeeze glutes.

Starting.

It's been three days since the sleepy town
of Madre Linda was rocked

by the disappearance of Natalie Engler.

The 32-year-old realtor was last seen
leaving her home for work.

Her vehicle was found outside
a cabin near Redwoods State Park.

- Ready, sweetie?
- Yeah.

All right, here we go.

Her husband,
tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,

who made his fortune
in cutting-edge surveillance,

has not made a public statement.

God, I hope she just ran off somewhere.

For now, friends are hopeful

that the police will find her
with the help of this community.

Reporting live from Madre Linda,
Ryan Goodwin, Channel 3 News.

We got it.

Every day it's the same fucking story.

We need him to give a statement.

And our son is mercifully
once again sleeping.

- Can I make you some eggs?
- There's more vans than yesterday.

I wish they'd move on already.

You are worried.

I'm sure they will. Soon.

Your previous mistakes were cleaned up
by the family fixer.

No media or police to deal with
when they've been paid off.

When do you think
everything will die down?

A week, maybe two.

How can you be so calm?

Experience. Try killing
a celebrity comedian without a fixer.

Joe.

I'm scared.

Dr. Chandra said
that we should give words to our emotions.

Well, I'm...

scared.

I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.

We have done everything right.

But the ring?
That was a close call, but we fixed it.

We talked to the cops.

They didn't raise an eyebrow.

This won't take long.

Is there anything
you can tell us about Natalie Engler

or her relationship with her husband?

We just moved here
a few months ago with a newborn,

so we haven't had much time
for socializing.

Yeah. She did help me lease my bakery,
but other than that,

I don't really know them.

- I wish we could tell you more.
- Can I refill your coffee?

Of course they're not gonna act
like they're suspicious.

True. But we haven't given them
a reason to be suspicious. What?

A few questions, sir.

Matthew, Channel 6.
A quick statement, please.

Hey, hey.

Look.

Have the police said anything?

Get off my property
or I'll have you removed.

- Matthew, statement.
- Can you say something?

He's innocent, but he's acting guilty.
That's strange but... good.

Good for us.
If he goes down for this, we're free.

You're doing
your Lady Macbeth thing again.

Like when you wanted
to frame Ellie for killing Hendy.

You feel trapped
and it's clouding your judgment.

It's probably best
if no one goes down for this, right?

Like, if nobody finds the body,
people will eventually assume she ran off.

Yeah. You're right.

What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

This.

Just normal life.
We keep watching the news, just in case.

We go to work.

We take care of Henry.

I'll keep us safe, I promise.

So...

just be normal.

Exactly.

Something terrible happened
to Natalie Engler.

We had nothing to do with it.

We are just the nice,
normal neighbors next door.

Crying for the camera isn't
for everyone, fine.

But he's just working.

I know why I'm acting normal,
but why is he?

Fuck. The last thing I need is
to inspire him to start watching me.

- Look! Grandma's here!
- Thank you, Mustafa. Ciao.

Why were you talking to our trust lawyer?

Dreadful divorce nonsense.
Don't get me started.

Is that woman still missing?
I had to park two streets over.

Come here, my darling, my darling.

Glamma missed you. Glamma missed you.
Glamma missed you.

I'm sure the husband did it.
You have to watch out for husbands.

Ray would love to have me killed.

You know,
that's if I don't have him killed first.

I assume there's coffee.

Let me get some coffee. Yeah. Yeah.

- Do you think he's warm?
- I think he's just tired.

Maybe I should stay.

You're projecting
your anxiety on your son.

Go run your bakery.

Forty and I are gonna have
a beautiful day.

âª Baby, baby âª

Hey, guys. What can I get you?

Thanks for asking.
But we're here as concerned citizens.

We started the committee
to find Natalie Engler.

Did she ever say anything to you
about wanting to run away?

Or being scared of creepy Matthew?

Um, uh...

No.

Don't you think this is premature?

- We don't know if anything bad...
- Matter of time.

Oh, my God, have you seen
the Tracy Paulson murder docuseries?

I have. Spoiler alert, it's the husband.

- Always the husband.
- Always.

I heard Matthew wasn't even
the first to call the police.

- Her sister did.
- Love.

Have you ever heard Natalie
and Matthew fighting?

Joe and I barely know them.

She showed me this place
shortly before, you know...

This must be so difficult for you.

Thank you.

Honestly, the only thing I can do
to feel normal is come here.

And...

these keto vanilla bean scones.

Sure you don't want one?

- Why not? Oh.
- I would love a couple.

Brandon is coming off of an IF,
so this will be a nice treat for him.

End of each day, check tables
and study carrels for re-shelves.

That's where they go until the last...

Somehow, I chose
the perfect place to be normal in.

An oasis of unpretentious regular people.

I love it here.

Hello?

My grown-up hall monitor
of a boss notwithstanding.

Sorry about that.

I have to say, I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

Unless you're one of those parents

trying to pad a nonexistent
community-service rÃ©sumÃ©

to get his kid
into one of the top schools.

Is she psychic?

Mm-hm.

Hey, Dante. This is Joe.

Dante Ferguson. Former Navy.

One hundred percent blind.
Longtime friend of my new stern boss.

Dante will be your go-to
for any questions. He knows all.

All-knowing Dante's listening
to the news. It's about Natalie Engler.

Oh, no.

Madre Linda has
her own Missing White Woman.

Missing White Woman Syndrome is
America's favorite pastime next to porn.

- Missing White Woman...?
- Syndrome.

When upper-class,
attractive white ladies go missing,

they get tons of media coverage.

- Doesn't happen for other victims.
- Yeah.

Well, the media has a thirst
for anything salacious, right?

Why do I feel like I'm failing a test?

We're speaking of a specific phenomenon.

When white women receive
disproportionately high attention,

a clear message is being sent.

White ladies deserve to be rescued.
The rest of us can fend for ourselves.

Agreed. Obviously.

I'm not sure why you're saying "obviously"

when you didn't even know
about the phenomenon.

Mm. She got you there, beanpole.

- How does he know I...?
- Tender is the Night.

You knew her.

- We're neighbors.
- Shush.

They're about to interview her friend.

- Mind if I have a bathroom break?
- Bathroom's that way.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

- Dante, kill me now.
- Is he cute?

Are you kidding me?

We set up a tip line,

and you can follow us
on Facebook, Twitter,

Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, and Tumblr.

For those of you
that are still using that.

Finding Natalie seems
incredibly important to you.

Oh, my God, it's my number one priority.
Natalie was my dearest and closest friend.

She hated her.

We all loved her.

I'm not really sure why
her husband hasn't told you this,

but I think the public would like
to hear from him.

And she just slipped in
a Matthew dig on live television.

Bitchy, but not the worst thing for us.

Why do you think Natalie's disappearance

has struck such a chord in this community?

Natalie is a woman who cares deeply
for this town and everyone in it.

In fact, one of the last things she did

was lease a space for a bakery
for her next-door neighbor.

She lives right over there.

Did Sherry Conrad just tell
the entire world

that one of the last people who saw
the Missing White Woman was my wife?

I have to reassure you.
Everything is fine. Still fine.

Who the hell is this?

Hello?

Hi. Yeah, absolutely.
What can I do for you, detective?

Fuck me.

When we spoke
to you and your wife,

you said you barely knew Natalie.

Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

Then why is there security footage

of you two chatting
in a grocery store parking lot

two days before she vanished?

Sweating? I need to get it together.

Coincidence. I like to say hi
when I run into a neighbor.

How do you explain...

this exchange?

Does every inch of Madre Linda
have a camera?

Do you typically receive prophylactics
from your neighbors

when you just stop to say hi?

They don't suspect me.
They are just doing their job.

I need to stop sweating.

- You can deal with that if you need to.
- So they can observe my behavior.

No, it's fine. It's okay.

Condoms...

The thing is,
Natalie has a weird sense of humor,

and she gave these to me as a joke.

I still don't know what she meant.

What do they want? A confession?

Wait. That's not a terrible idea.

I wasn't going to say this.
But I think I need to come clean.

I live with a newborn...

and a very stressed wife.

There's nowhere...

for a man to enjoy himself,
if you understand what I'm saying.

Add in a mother-in-law who stops
by unannounced frequently...

We strongly advise you

to not do that anymore.

I will try to contain myself.

Masturbation saves the day for now.

We're at A Fresh Tart and look at this.

We got Madre Linda's
newest baking queen, Love Quinn.

- Are you...?
- I'm making an ironic TikTok.

Delete it!

Okay.

- Sorry.
- Thank you.

- Yep. It's deleted.
- I'm just having a bad hair day.

Looks pretty good to me.

Stop that.

Stop what?

Flirting.

Yeah, okay. Yes. Yes.

- Yes, you are right. You are married.
- Thank you.

Now, what can I get you?

Okay, so my house
is swarming with reporters.

So I had to jump my fence
just to go get some lunch,

which is also the story
of why I forgot my wallet.

Ah.

And now I am gonna die
starving and destitute.

Unless...

you were to...

My issue is that you're still flirting
and I asked you not to.

I'm not flirting with you.
I'm begging you for food.

Okay. Jesus fucking Christ.

Thank you, my lady and savior.

Okay.

- Carrot or chai walnut?
- Carrot, please.

Fuck, did I just fail
a secret personality test or something?

Oh, no, I, um...

That was my first recipe.

And I used to make it all the time
for my brother when he would...

When he came around.

Well, let's see.

Are you fucking kidding me?

What the fuck?

Must be hard with Natalie missing.

You know, I love a media zoo.

How are you holding up?
Do you have people you can talk to?

I wasn't trying to pry. I'm, um...

Mom? I'm sorry. I can't...

Wait, slow down.

Oh, my God. Um...

Okay. Yes. I'm on my way. Mm-hm.

- Is everything okay? What's going on?
- My baby is sick.

- Oh.
- I need to go.

I need to close the bakery
and turn off the ovens.

No, I know. You know what?
I got it. I got it. I can do it.

I know how ovens work. It'll be fine.
Go be with your baby. Go.

- Be with your baby.
- Yeah.

- There's a spare key in the drawer.
- Okay, in the drawer.

Yeah.

What if the detectives
weren't just fishing?

What if they know more
than they were saying?

But no one knew about Natalie and me
except Love, at least, I think.

Unless...

There.

Matthew. What if there were more cameras?

What if she lied to me,
her boring neighbor?

What if Matthew's building a case
against me?

Shit.

I never called you back. I must be calm.

You're a steady, stalwart Atticus Finch.

- I'm sorry, they had more questions.
- I'm at the hospital.

Henry has the measles.

I've been kidnapped,
held at knifepoint, held at gunpoint,

lost a finger, been locked in a cage,

but in my history of scared,

this...

is the most scared I've ever been.

That nurse has been gone
an awfully long time.

It's a quick test. He'll be right back.

I looked at his blood work
and he was infected about a week ago.

How? I thought
the measles were eradicated.

Even with COVID,

there are parents
who don't have their kids vaccinated.

You need to contact anyone
who's been near Henry right away.

You've all had your immunizations?

- Yes.
- Yeah.

I'm sure I did.

Oh, really, Ms. Peace,
Love and Yoni Eggs?

- Are you sure you had Love vaccinated?
- What does...? Yes, don't be ridiculous.

What are the symptoms?

- Fever?
- Cough, runny nose, general discomfort.

Now, in severe cases,
hearing loss, possible seizures.

Correction.
This is the most scared I've ever been.

Is there medicine?

For the fever.
Otherwise, it has to run its course.

We'll keep him a few more hours
for observation.

Okay.

Thank you.

Hi, Margaret, it's Love.

Sorry to be delivering this news,
but Henry has the measles.

I'm calling from the hospital.

Thought I should let you know

since we were all
at Hudson's birthday party last week.

- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God.

Um...

- I'm getting a call. Do you mind?
- I have to go.

- Hi, Sherry. I was about to call.
- I just heard.

Poor little guy!

But you do not need to feel embarrassed.

Embarrassed?

Why don't I handle the calls
so you can focus on Henry?

Um, that's very kind,
but it's important that I do it myself.

Love? Love?

Ooh.

Did you hear about Love's baby?

- What happened?
- What happened?

My heart is breaking for them.

Yes, I have to run, Mustafa.
Can we finish this afternoon?

Good. Ciao.

How were those calls?
I hope your friends weren't too upset.

Why were you on the phone?

If something's wrong, you need to tell me.

I'm buying a vineyard.

- You're doing what?
- Buying a vineyard, Love.

So the money that was in flux
is no longer there.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Your bakery will be fine.

You'll figure it out.

You're amazing.

- Now don't get upset.
- I'm not upset. This is enlightening.

I keep asking myself, wondering:

"Why do I keep trying
to win Sherry's approval

when she keeps stabbing me in the back
like a fucking stealth cunt?"

It's obvious.
I'm recreating my relationship with you.

You're under a lot of stress.
I know you don't mean...

God. I want you to leave.

I came here for a fresh start,
and you followed me here

and brought
all your toxic garbage with you.

You have so much anger.

It's not healthy.

Is this retribution for my sins?

You have to get better.

I haven't always been the best person.

But being your dad...

is changing me.

You get better.

Just get better. I promise
to be a man worthy of raising you.

Ryan Goodwin with the latest
in the Natalie Engler investigation.

Friends close to Natalie Engler say
she went missing

shortly after submitting
the lease for this bakery,

owned by local resident
Love Quinn-Goldberg.

Could this be the last place
Natalie was seen?

Joe?

As if things weren't fucked enough.

So cops are asking you questions,
and my name and business are on the news.

Acting normal isn't working.
We need to do something.

You're right.
You're right. Matthew's a threat.

But everybody already thinks
that he did something to her.

You're saying...?

Frame him. Trying to think
of a word not from a movie.

It's fine. I'm in.

How?

I do still have one thing from the box.

Natalie's scarf with her blood on it.
I only kept it for insurance.

Take care of it.

Whoa. Oof.

Okay.

What? How? No. But it can't be.

I thought I was sweating
because I'm guilty.

The measles, for fuck's sake!
What else can go wrong?

That... That came on fast.

I've gotta get to Matthew's house
to plant the scarf.

Uh. I'm burning up.
Room is spinning. Everything...

I've got to do this. All over a scarf.

Focus, focus.

I should lie down.

You sure about that?

This can't be good.

Weren't you in the middle of something?

Like saving your family?

Yes.

Yes, my family.

I have to plant
Natalie's scarf at Matthew's.

You could hop the fence in the backyard.

No. No, he has cameras.

The one outside is broken.
If you're worried, pop a hoodie on.

You'll look just like
Matthew's douchebag kid.

Sealed and everything.

It's almost like you anticipated
needing it all along.

- Shut up.
- You shut up.

Where are you going?

Where you should be going.
Boo Radley's house.

Okay.

One foot in front of the other.

Where is he?

Where's Henry?

Did you get vaccinated, Joe?

He's not moving! Somebody get a doctor!
Somebody help me!

Joe?

Are you not feeling well?

I'm Nurse Fiona.
I'm going to check you out.

Come in. Sit down.

Open up.

So you think you have a fever, huh?

- If the boys are being mean to you...
- I can take care of myself.

I know.

You can stay here as long as you like.

You're gonna be fine.

You know, I noticed that we don't have
any record of your vaccinations.

- Did your mom ever take you to get a shot?
- Yeah, of course.

I think maybe in the move,
we lost a record or something, but...

she did it.

She was good.

No. No, you shouldn't have said that.

If you hadn't lied, you wouldn't be sick.

Tell the nurse. She was a terrible mother.

- Stop it.
- She was selfish and crazy.

- Stop.
- Didn't take care of you.

Go away. Go away!

- Where are you going?
- It's too late now!

Hey! Look at me! Hey!
Look at me! Look at me!

Calm down.

Calm down.

I think this is real.

What were you doing in my backyard?

Fuck.

Fuck. Fuck!

Love.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Um, here.
I thought I would bring you dinner.

It's tacos.

Very thoughtful of you.

So how is your son doing?

- He's okay.
- Yeah? That's good.

He's, uh...

He's not okay.

Some fucking brain-dead anti-vaxxer
got him sick,

and it's probably getting
other people infected

with some horrible life-threatening virus
that shouldn't even be a thing anymore.

Hey, hey, hey.

It's okay.

- I'm sorry.
- Hey. Mm-mm.

You don't have to apologize.

Oh. I locked up the store.

It was a really nice distraction
from being at home.

Until the news crew arrived.

Mm.

Uh, when are you going back to school?

Uh, I don't know. I feel like...

we should probably wait
until we know about Natalie.

So if you need some cheap-to-free labor
at the bakery,

I'm your guy.

Yeah, come in whenever you want.

I could use the help.

Okay.

That would be great. Yeah.

Especially if it gets me away
from my dad. Even better.

He's really that hard to live with?

Yeah.

He's just never really been
a communicator,

but, you know, his wife's missing.

So if there was a time

to start expressing
some form of emotion, it's now.

But he's not.
He's, like, totally closed off.

I don't know.
I just feel like it's gonna make him,

like, even that more unreachable.

You okay?

- Ms. Quinn-Goldberg?
- Yes.

- A moment?
- Yes. Thank you.

- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

How did I end up here?

Oh, I was coming here to hide the scarf.
Did he catch me trying to hide it?

I'm sick.

I was having a fever dream.

I must have hopped your fence.

I've got the measles.

- So you really...
- I've been immunized.

Surprised you weren't.

It's like he's waiting for me
to give myself away.

What would
a normal neighbor say right now?

Yeah, me too. I should've known.

I have a few gaps in my childhood.

I'm sorry about your wife.

I considered coming over,
but I didn't wanna bother you.

There's that look again.

Does he know I kissed Natalie?

Is he the reason the police are up my ass?

- Natalie said you were becoming friends.
- Shit.

- You had a glass of wine.
- Game over.

Did she say anything to you
about going to visit her sister?

Or he doesn't know anything.

He's just hoping
I can help him find his missing wife.

I'm sorry.

She didn't mention it.

You should rest.

I gave you some Tylenol
to help bring down the fever.

Is it possible Matthew's a nice guy?

Thank you.

Sure.

- There's no updates on my son.
- What's wrong with your son?

He's sick too.

He's in the hospital.

What if he doesn't get better?

What if they get punished for our sins?

I think...

it's not punishment, it's...

They reflect our sins back at us
so clearly, it's blinding.

I never saw myself becoming a father.

Then I met Theo's mom.
People become dads all kinds of ways.

I was even kind of excited about it,
and Theo was a great kid.

But I was young and extremely ambitious.

I was a shitty stepdad
and he hated me for it.

But now his mom's remarried, new family,
and Theo hates her even more.

He's come back here almost by default.

Most of the time,
I still have no idea what I'm doing.

All I know is that he needs me.

He needs me on some primal level,
just like your son needs you.

Are you sure Natalie didn't say anything
to you about taking a trip?

I'm sure she's fine.

She's done this for attention,
and she's too embarrassed to come home.

You don't think
anything's happened to her, do you?

What have we done, Love?

I wanna help, but safest thing

is to let him stay silent and hang himself
in the court of public opinion.

He's okay.

- He's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

Henry's okay.

And I promised him
I'd be a good man, worthy.

I cannot frame an innocent man.
I can't do it.

I'd be killing a mockingbird.

I know that you love Natalie,
but you're not talking to the press.

- I don't care about the press.
- You should.

If you don't tell your story,
they will tell it for you.

You can't be there for Theo
if you're behind bars.

Hey.

Oh, hey.

Oh, no, no.
I didn't realize you were sick too.

- You poor thing.
- It's okay. It's okay. I'm recovering.

- How is he?
- He misses his daddy.

Don't ever scare us like that again,
Mr. Dramatic.

I love you too much.

Did you do it?

What you're really asking is
what kind of father I am.

Wish you could go through the front.

- Reporters, I get it.
- Yeah.

- You sure I can't help you home?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

My wife and kid are coming back.

- You've done more than enough.
- Okay. Get home safe.

Don't wanna find you passed out
by the trash again.

Mm.

I did it.

But then...

I took it back.

Matthew's a decent man.

He already lost his wife.
If we send him to prison...

What kind of people would we be?

Wow.

You get it.

We're better than that.

We are.

What does it mean to be a good father?

To protect, yes.

But can you be a good father

if you're a bad man?

It's not the kind of father I wanna be
and the kind of mother you wanna be.

Thank God.

Our little Scout will be better for it.

âª I swore that I'd become âª

âª A better man for you and I tried âª

âª Tried to change my ways âª

âª And walk the line you follow âª

âª I bore a flame that burned âª

âª A thousand suns for you but it died âª

âª Told you I could never
Love somebody else âª

âª But I lied âª

âª Mm, I lied âª

âª Mm, I lied âª

The vigil was beautiful.

The whole town came.

Is he gonna come out? I don't get it.

Is this some kind of strategy?

Sherry and Kiki
held out the longest,

but that's so they could grab
the best flowers for a photo shoot.

A Natalie tribute, of course.

Tasteful as the day is long.

Let's go. Come on.

I don't think Matthew wanted
to look even guiltier,

but not showing up to your wife's vigil...

- Matthew.
- Matthew, sir.

He's out. Come on. Let's go. Camera up.

...ask you a couple
quick questions, Matthew?

It would mean a lot to Natalie to see
how many people came out here.

How many people care.

It wasn't a strategy.

He waited so long
because he almost couldn't do it.

It's that hard for him to talk about her.

Because he cares.

I am worried about my wife.
Natalie, if you're watching this,

please come home.

Or let me know you're okay.

The truth is, Matthew doesn't have
to go down for this.

We need you.

I need you.

And if somebody out there
has done something to my wife...

I will find you...

and you will be punished.

Thank you.

Has your wife ever left you before?

Have you notified her family?

Matthew, anything to...

That's it?

Contrary to popular belief,
it's not always the husband.

But we're not going down for this either.

They've got nothing.
Even if they find something,

we'll take care of it.

We always do.

Falco.

We found the ring.

Okay.

It's been said,
"Nothing ever happens in the suburbs."

- Hey.
- Hey.

It's an inadequate gesture
for making sure I didn't die last week.

Unnecessary. Thank you.
I'm glad you're better.

If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a call.

Maybe it's more like,
"Nothing ever really changes."

- Hey.
- You're not closed yet, are you?

No, Gil, hey. You're just in time.
What can I get you?

- How about half a dozen blueberry?
- Coming right up.

Hey, I haven't seen Margaret.

- Wanna tell her I said hi?
- Yeah, yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

Margaret would have come too,

but she took the girls to her mom's
while they're recovering.

Oh. Were they sick?

Not anymore.

But they both had it.

Can't tell you how sorry we are
for exposing Henry.

Both your daughters had measles?

Margaret really regrets not saying
anything when you called.

She was just stunned to hear
that Henry had to be hospitalized.

Our girls were pretty minor.

We hope you won't hold it against us.

You see, we just don't believe
in subjecting kids

to toxic injections they don't need

to fight things
their bodies were created to fight.

We don't judge people who do, of course.

Anyway, I... Jeez.
I didn't come here to get on a soapbox.

Again, we apologize.

The most important thing is
that everyone is better now, right?

Thanks.

- Hey, Gil?
- Yep?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

It's been three days
since the disappearance of Natalie Engler.

- Falco.
- We found the ring.

Okay.

Love, this is my son, Theo.

Didn't know you had a son.

I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

I'm at the hospital.
Henry has the measles.

- Who do you think it was?
- Not closed yet, are you?

Can't tell you
how sorry we are for exposing Henry.

We hope you won't hold it against us.

- Hey, Gil.
- Yep?

Well, this came sooner than expected.

The proverbial paint is hardly dry.

Breathing.

It's more than I can say for Natalie.
Meaning, you did the right thing.

Controlled your impulses.

So I won't be frustrated
with you, Love. No.

This is growth,

and it's important I show you
I recognize it...

No. Appreciate it.

I'll set aside the fact that we're using
our son's baby monitor as surveillance.

It's twisted but smart.

Hey, Gil. Hey, buddy.

Hey there.

Hey.

She hit me.

I'm so sorry.

"Slipped and hit your head" is
off the table.

Your wife. She knocked me out.

Can't say it was a shock.

I was shocked.

I said, "Gil? Nice guy Gil?"

'Course she told me what you said.

Not that it justified what she did.
The thing is, if you could have seen...

what she went through
in the hospital with our baby...

Here.

Still, she should not have done this.

That's for sure.

It's a proofing room.
Something about temperature and humidity.

Keeps the dough from getting a tough skin.
I'm not sure I understand any of it.

That's Margaret with her gardening.

Seeds and soil pH and...

Friendly chatter's
a reflex with this guy.

You may have assaulted the one person
who might give us a pass for this.

Love and I are very embarrassed.

Is there any chance
we could keep this between us?

We will not tell a soul
how you recklessly endangered our son.

- I don't know I would put it like that.
- No? How?

Well, it's just... No judgment.

But to dose an infant
with chemicals we know nothing about?

- I mean, I call that reckless.
- Hmm.

Actually, your son has naturally
gained immunity, so...

I'd say it was beneficial.

You know what? I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry, I get carried away.
- No, no, no.

You might be right, yeah.

- Our child is fine.
- Yeah.

Here.

Here, let me help you up.

Ooh.

So, what do you say, bygones?

Okay.

Sure. Bygones.

He's lying.

- Are you absolutely sure?
- I'm cool!

I'm cool. Let me out, please?

No doubt. He'll go straight to the police.

- Fuck.
- Guys, let's be grown-ups about this!

- Now what?
- Come on!

Here we go. Coming in hot, Henry. Hey.

Got to bank to the left.
Here. Open. There we go.

Peek in our window,
you see your typical suburban family

having a typical morning.

You know, it can be blissful...

watching our son discover
the pleasures of sweet potatoes.

All I really need.

I did have a thought.

Mutually-assured destruction.

Get something that he doesn't want
anyone else to know about

and he can't expose us.

- He opens his mouth, we open ours.
- Worked for me once before.

It would have, Benji.

- He may look like a choirboy...
- So did Dahmer.

A plan in place,
a Monday's worth of returns.

I got lots of time to learn what Gil's
hiding behind the Mr. Rogers persona.

Okay. All right. So Google
out of my boss's eagle-eyeline.

Kids are gonna commit hara-kiri.

No child sacrifice in the library, please.

Gil is MIA. He was our reader today,

and I told Lansing
I'd run the boys to the dentist.

- He did not just say "Gil."
- That's so not like Gil.

He's their favorite. Man's a saint.

Except for that one dark thing
about him that Dante knows?

You know better than that.
Not even the saints were saints.

Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.

- I could read to the kids.
- I've got it.

Okay.

Joe Goldberg? Hi.
Did I know you work here?

Did I know you had
your breasts enhanced in 2017?

Vlogged your recovery
from Adderall addiction?

Brother's a roadie
for 5 Seconds of Summer?

Cool to post this?

This is stupid!

Hey, hello? Hey!

- Hey, you...
- I could have one of everything.

Well, I wouldn't tell.

But my ass would.

God, I envy you, Love.

I have so many photo shoots,
next thing you know,

people will be calling me "brave"
and then unfollowing

'cause I'm no longer aspirational.

Mind if I post this?

Oh.

Perfect. Okay, ciao.

Ciao.

- Fuck.
- Love, listen.

That ring, it was supposed
to look like she left it there,

then moved on,
but of course they want to look there.

- What if we missed something else?
- We control what we can.

We keep up appearances.

We volunteer to help with the search.

- God.
- It's gonna be okay.

Okay.

I'll see you at home.

A man in a cage is a problem.

Few hundred citizens combing the woods

where we buried
and exhumed Natalie Engler?

Full-stop crisis.

I don't understand why I would go to this!

- Theo, can you be reasonable?
- You can't make me volunteer!

- That's implied in the word "volunteer"...
- Theo! Keep your voice down.

Dad, they're making you look pathetic.

I am not going.

When you're ready to talk like a person
above the age of 6, I'll be inside.

Hey, was the idea to be so loud,
the whole neighborhood could hear?

'Cause that was gauche.
You sounded like a brat.

You little peeping Tom. You spying on me?

What's up with all the dad theatrics?

Um...

So, apparently, Sherry Conrad
and her creepy little squad

are teaming up with the cops
to go search some state park

to, like, I don't know,
find Natalie out there stacking rocks?

You don't want to join?

I've been waiting
for this opportunity to join a cabal

of soulless, bulimic yoga moms.
I think it's my calling.

They're convinced that he killed her.

I don't want him helping
the villagers sharpen their pitchforks.

You should go. Optics are a thing.
If you don't go, both of you look bad.

Hey, hey, hey.

I will be your search buddy. Hmm?

Tie my shoes and everything?

If necessary.

Brat.

Hey, you should get this fixed by the way.

This "Hands Across
Madre Linda" exercise in the woods

has me dangerously distracted.

What if we did leave something
for John and Betty Volunteer to find?

But we weren't careless, were we?

Focus! One thing at a time.

Need to find Gil's fatal flaw.

"Geology rocks." "Schist happens."

If I've mined anything, it's that
"Rock Star" Professor Gil Brigham

has a taste for geologist humor.

Once taught at Burgess College
in Columbus, Ohio.

Left in his second year. In October. Hmm.

It's abrupt.

Did he transgress with a co-ed?

"Sophomore Burgess student
victim of campus attack."

Could it be...?

Hmm.

Four hours in
and the only fault I can find

is Gil's sense of humor.

Spotless academic career, church,
a dedication to his kids so deep

he may be the inspiration
for those World's Greatest Dad mugs.

Never misses a game, a birthday...

Look, he volunteers
at the children's ward...

And shit! The library.

Better account for today.

Sorry to miss today. A little work crisis.

Sorry to disappoint the kids.

- Who are we stalking?
- Hey.

- No, no, I'm just...
- You seen Peer Gynt?

Yes. In that I stole it for Ellie.

Yeah, I may have taken it home for a read.

You took a 2500-dollar book
that isn't supposed to leave?

You know how when you know a rule exists,

but you don't think it applies to you

because you're quick
and careful, and you work here.

For those of us who didn't grow up
with first editions for coasters...

I'm sorry,
you think that I come from money?

Look what you've done to me, Love.
I smell like the rich now.

Just let me say this.

There were no first editions
on the shelves growing up

because there were no... shelves.

- Right. You were poor.
- Practically homeless.

A bookstore owner took me in
and let me work for free,

and I slept in a cage in his basement.

No, wait. Marienne, hang on.
Wait, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Stop. That crossed the line.
It was an exaggeration.

We straddled the poverty line
my entire childhood,

and I escaped with books.

I learned all about them,

like you wanna know everything
about that one beautiful thing.

It saves your miserable life.

So I...

I misjudged a little, maybe.

Generally, my favorite apologies
are stiff and grudging...

Fair.

I'm sorry.

Ah...

And I guess I might have
to like you after all, Goldberg.

- Perish the thought.
- Hmm.

Since we're friends now,
what else did you take?

A Dickens, a Shelley,
a signed early Strand.

- Nothing.
- Mm-hm.

Make sure that's still true
when I look real hard tomorrow.

Okay?

- Thought we had a deal!
- We did. I'm sorry.

You know, you can't keep me in here
like some animal.

People know that I was coming here.
So you can let me out or the police can.

- When they come looking...
- No one's gonna save you. We...

We already made excuses on your behalf.

Uh...

I'm sorry, Gil.
I want to let you out, man.

I won't tell a soul.

I promise.

I told you, we can keep this between us.

Say...

we knew something about you.

Something you really don't want
anyone to know.

Right, I see.

Okay, I keep your secret, you keep mine.

And this time,
you'll keep your end of the deal?

Yes.

Okay. Okay.

Just... Give me a minute to think.

I got it!

Okay, listen.

Couple years back, our church group went
to a festival for Christ in Vegas.

Christ? Vegas?
Strong starter ingredients.

We raised funds for the Santoses,

who'd lost their home to a fire.

And now, there's this woman, Cheryl.

Christ. Vegas. Cheryl.

Real, you know, fun-lover.
You know the type.

Anyway, everyone else had gone to bed,

but she and I have
a little more in our tanks.

So...

So we take the 600 dollars
that we'd raised, and...

A room with a pile of blow
and a dominatrix dressed as a nun.

Why didn't I start here this morning?

We put it all on red.

And lost.

That sucks. Then what?

Then we had to recoup it
from our own savings that Monday.

- That's it?
- "That's it?"

- We gambled and lost the Santoses' money.
- And you returned it... It was a Monday?

Yeah, but we lied.

You know, we were selfish.

If people knew that, are you kidding me?

Okay.

Okay, fine. I slept with her.

I did.

Real rough-style too.

- Can you define "rough style"?
- You know, when...

I'm trying to give you something.

- Got to do better, Gil.
- Fuck!

Fuck.

So I managed to rolling-pin
the only saint in Madre Linda?

Not even the saints are saints.

But, look, I... I don't know.

My mom's taking Henry tomorrow.

- With everything...
- It's a good idea.

"Committee to Find Natalie Engler"

is organizing a search party in
Redwood State Park, which is Natalie's...

Better give her a frozen one.

In case of an earthquake, right? Or...

we're taken in for questioning.

Joe?

- Tell me not to panic.
- There's nothing for them to find.

What if they do?

What if they get a search warrant
or they start looking around?

"What's in this basement?"

Why is it feeling
like this has become my fault?

It's your fault
your mommy left you here, Goldberg.

We need to get rid of Gil.

We can't have this hanging over our heads.

I know.

Okay, so we built the cage
so that we could stop and think.

What if we've done that and now...?

- What? And now what?
- What you gonna do, Goldberg?

He's gonna cry.

Just like he cries for his mommy
in bed very night.

We didn't want... to do this.

- We did this to protect our family.
- It had to be done.

You were protecting me.
You're a good boy, Joey.

What if the only option is for Gil to...?

She's not coming for you.

No one is coming to save you.

Yeah.

Give me a better idea.

- I can't believe you're saying this.
- I'm just asking questions.

You're saying, "I don't know."

You hit him and put him in a cage
when we could've...

- Sued him.
- The cage was your idea.

- No, no, no. We are not going to...
- How...?

You are not making me kill anyone!

We are not doing that to our son.

I shouldn't.

Not exactly getting my run in down here.

Used to be my son Alan and I
got out there every morning.

Before he went off to Dartmouth.

- He'd get a kick out of this.
- He would?

Come on. His pops knocked down a peg?

You know...

sons and their fathers.

Yeah, I'm new to it.

You kidding?
This idea that you have to mold them

into a good strong man...

How'd you?

Mm.

I came to realize it's a lot simpler
than I was making it.

Here's what you do as a parent:

You keep them healthy and safe
and be a good person.

That's it. Protect, be good,
get out of the way.

To be honest, I'm jealous.

You have it all ahead of you.

Hey, um...

whatever happens here,
I just hope I get to see them again.

...hoping we can buy another 30 acres
of this wonderful property on the coast

that apparently gets
this great fog Pinot thrives in.

Sweetie, hand me
those fleece-y p.j.'s in case it's cold.

Butt Paste. He's been a bit red lately.
So I'm gonna...

Worried?
If you think this vineyard business

is going to jeopardize the bakery,
it's the opposite.

- This is how empires are born.
- Yeah, it's actually not that. I, um...

Does Dad still have that guy Cy?

Probably has that little snake digging
into me right now.

Why, what's up?

I know it was something.

Oh, it's no big. I just...

I got a weird vibe from the guy
I rent the bakery from.

I wanna make sure he's legit.
I don't want to put in all of this work

just to have the property seized
by the IRS.

I'll get you his number.

I did something you're not gonna
be totally... psyched about.

Try me.

My mom...

gave me a number for a guy
that my dad uses to look into people.

You involved your family?

I didn't tell them anything. Okay?

I contacted him directly.
I didn't tell him why. He's discreet.

- You're mad at me anyway.
- I'm not mad. I'm worried.

I'm worried.

- That we can't deal with this?
- That you'll hate me

if we don't do it the right way.

The look on your face when you said
you thought Henry would be hurt if...

I'm sorry. I...

I scared you.

No.

Joe...

it broke my heart.

I see how hard
you're trying to be a good dad.

You're scared one little move is
gonna magically fuck it all up.

No, I know it's not magic
because I saw it growing up, how...

What kids are exposed to sticks.
Fucks them up for life.

You've been through a lot.
You're not fucked up for life.

I know.

But I don't wanna roll the dice
with Henry.

I... You know I understand.

I think about it with Forty.
If he'd grown up differently, maybe...

I get it.

I'm just...

trying to fix this.

Hey.

I love you.

Hey, Cy.
No, of course I'm not busy. What is it?

Really?

Oh, that's rich.

I cheated to get my son
into Dartmouth? Why?

Alan is a stellar student.
Not the world's best test-taker...

Dartmouth received perfect test scores
from your son.

No. He got in on his GPA,
his essay and community service.

And his perfect SAT score.
And there's also...

Yeah, all-American water polo
until a career-ending injury.

- That isn't my son's transcript.
- No? 'Cause there's also this.

That's 50 K you donated
to a Bennett's Fund

to help underprivileged kids have
a shot at college.

- You're good at this.
- What's that got to do with anything?

There is no Bennett's Fund.
Or there is, but for kids like Alan.

Disturbingly good.

That's 25,000 to a Frye family

whose all-star cheerleader Vicky
graduated with Alan.

What? Did they agree to vouch
they build houses in Haiti or some shit?

Wait, wait, wait.

- Wait a second.
- What?

You had no idea, did you?

Why...?

Why would my wife...?

Oh, God.

Oh, no.

Alan.

Not again.

He promised he would be good.

This is worse
than some college scandal.

Alan did something to this Vicky.

It was a payoff.

His beloved Alan is a very bad young man
who hurts girls.

It was Alan in Ohio, right?

The girl who was attacked...

sexually assaulted.

The reason you left.

And he did it again.

I believed
that it was just a onetime mistake.

I made my mistakes at that age, so I...

I did nothing.

Now another girl got hurt.

I made poor Margaret feel
like she had to do all this.

Gil said fatherhood was
just about protecting them

and getting out of the way,

but that's clearly not enough
to keep his son from going wrong.

Which is terrifying
but also exactly what we needed

to get Gil to play ball.

Our next move is to propose
his imminent relocation from Madre Linda.

Too bad for Ellie, my boss busted me,
so this book's back to the library.

I'll try again.

Now, as for Gil,
I wonder if he's marinated long enough.

What? No. No, no, no.

Oh, my God!

Get it off. Get it off him.

- Get it off him!
- I'm trying!

I'm trying. I'm trying.

Joe, we can't just sit here all night.

I... I need you to talk to me.

We need to do something about this.
We need to come up with some plan.

Joe, I really need you to listen to me.

Joe.

Joseph Quinn-Goldberg!

Hey.

This is not our fault.

He did this.

It was his decision.

We did everything to keep our promise.

Why the fuck did he have to...

kill himself? Oh, my God.

He's already ruined his family.

Fuck.

The search is starting soon.

Okay, okay.

I will make an appearance for us.

And then I will be back
as soon as I can. Okay?

Okay.

Okay, okay, okay.

Oh, my God.

Joe.

I have a plan.

In case you find something.

Hi, can you guys hear me okay? Hi.

Okay. Fine.

Thank you all for showing up.

If I may say on behalf
of Natalie's beautiful family,

we are so grateful

to each and every one of you.

Natalie is a fixture of Madre Linda.

We need her,

and now she needs us.

So good luck out there and...

Sorry.

Hashtag, "Natalie, come home."

The story you came up with, Love,
is fit for a steamy psychodrama.

Gil Brigham,
Madre Linda's answer to Ned Flanders,

had a secret.

But it was when you used
the phrase "two birds, one stone"

that I saw your true brilliance.

Two bodies, one story,
if we get this part right.

And we will. I will.

I have to.

It's on me to protect you and Henry.

There's no one else who will.

Here are your flags. Drop them as you go.

Hi, Matthew.

Hello.

- How are you holding up?
- Hmm.

I never really know
how to answer that question

when I'm out searching for my wife.

It's your... I'm sorry. I was just...
I just wanted to know...

I'm sorry this is happening.

I really am.

Well, I guess I have you to thank.

For getting Theodore to come.
He told me you talked to him.

- He called you a kind person.
- I barely said anything. I just...

He seems like a good kid.

Excuse me.

Yo, why is everyone so scared
of Sherry Conrad?

She is fucking pathetic, right?

I hear that her husband,

he has to take pharmaceutical molly
just so he can get it up for her.

Yeah.

Oh, and please tell me
you saw that speech, right?

I have to pee. Be right back.

Okay.

Awful, you know?

But if I was married
to a robot like Matthew Engler,

probably disappear too.

- Did you forget your bullhorn, Sherry?
- Theo!

If you have a theory,
make sure everyone hears it.

Everyone knows what you're doing.

You're trying to cash in
on someone else's tragedy,

- so you can sell your vegan panties...
- Hey! Theo!

And get all these likes on Instagram.

Count to ten, okay? Relax.

Hey, Sherry, are you okay?

He's having a very hard day.
He doesn't mean it.

Right, Theo?

You've done so much.

How about we just get back to it?

- Thank you.
- Of course.

Let's go.

- So that happened.
- "A hard day"?

Fucking seriously?

Does it hurt, Joe?

No idea why they did this to you?

It doesn't matter.

Counselors say I'm a lost cause.
I heard them.

Hey, no, no.

No kid is a lost cause.

Especially not you.

You know, if I were to adopt,
I would want an older kid.

You know why?
Because... you know who they are.

The whole messy truth.

And that's beautiful and worthwhile.

And exactly what I would want in my life.

No matter what happened in the past,

someone out there will want you too.
You're a good kid.

Excuse me, sir.

You calling Uber?

It's gonna rain. Get in.

Is that your best friend Sherry?

You know, it is really hard to stay mad

at the one person
that I can actually stand talking to.

Hmm. Stepdad still a brick wall?

He's got a lot going on.

But he's not a murderer.

Hey, how did you deal with it?

Like...

all the attention and the rubbernecking?

- You mean, about my brother?
- Yeah.

- I read the Vanity Fair article, so...
- Mm-hm.

He insisted that I cut his hair because
I was the only one that did it right.

And he loved the Ninja Turtle movie.

Uh, he always wanted to fast-forward
where the red one got hurt

because it made him too sad.

The shit that doesn't sell magazines.

The part where he was
a whole fucking human being.

The big,

beautiful, sensitive fucking heart.

He was the only person
who ever really knew me.

You know...

publicity...

it has a way of flattening.

Flattening you
and the people you love into types.

And it's really hard because nobody
will ever let you forget what happened.

Yeah.

Rain snuck up on us.

If it clears up soon,
we'll send people back out.

You can be honest.
Today accomplished absolutely nothing.

Besides something exciting
for the social media feeds

of people that barely knew my wife.

The search was always a long shot,

and you had no belief whatsoever
we'd find anything. None.

I've seen everything
up to this point, okay?

And, yes, usually, you're right.

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I mean, if we did find something...

It would probably be something
that indicated she's not alive anymore.

I know this is hard.

And I'd just say to you,
let us keep working.

Dearest Megy,

my heart aches as I write this.

You stood by me in spite of my flaws

and Lord knows you don't deserve
what I've done to you.

I strayed. No excuse.

Idiot me thought Natalie could
provide something I was missing.

When it became clear
she'd never belong exclusively to me,

I lost control.

I do not know what came over me.

Next thing I knew, I was standing there,
with an ax, her body on the ground.

And when I put her in the ocean,

I felt like I was possessed
by someone else.

But I am guilty all the same,
and I can't live with what I've done.

I'm sorry I hurt you.
And I'm sorry you found me like this.

I failed all of you. But especially Alan.

Didn't want to see in him
what I saw in myself.

Maybe you can mold him into a better man.

Tell him and the girls I love them.

And know that I love you, Megy.

More than you'll ever know.

Forgive me,

Your Gily.

Yeah, well, someone wrote a think piece
about my parents' divorce.

Yeah.

It was about the first wives
of tech superstars

and how Silicon Valley discards women.

Thought that was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

Yeah, look at you now.
Got a family tragedy all your own.

I'm not trying to sound flip. It's just...

- Welcome to the club.
- Mm. Do I get a gift bag?

Or does terrible family tragedy
make people more fuckable?

'Cause... Could really use
a silver lining.

Um...

In my experience, yes, but...

you end up resenting
the people who think that fucking you

was somehow gonna make them
more interesting.

Like it's gonna rub off on them
or something.

Don't let people like that define you.

Find the people that get you.

Lean on them.

Forty... My brother, he never really...

got that.

So how do you know who those people are?

You just do.

Um...

- Don't do that.
- Yep.

Oh, shit. I got a text from my dad.

Whoa. They think they found something.

They think they might have just found
a murder weapon.

Morning, everybody.

I'm Detective Falco
with the Madre Linda Police Department.

There's been a development
in the Natalie Engler investigation.

New evidence points to a suspect
in her disappearance

- and potentially her murder.
- We are hardly criminal masterminds.

Gily?

I got your text, honey.

I don't know why you insisted
on the kids staying with my mother.

But sometimes
all it takes is a good story.

Make it solid, sexy, relatable.

Give them just enough evidence.

It has come to our attention
that Mrs. Engler

was involved
in an extramarital relationship

with Madre Linda resident Gil Brigham,

a professor at Stanford University.

In a letter, Mr. Brigham confessed
he murdered Mrs. Engler and disposed...

And the town of Madre Linda settles
into begrudging acceptance

that the sordid tale
of suburban ennui, sex and murder

has come to an end

'cause, well, what bored suburbanite
isn't gonna buy that?

We did it, Love.

Let's be honest,
rebuilding the cage was crazy.

Could've really backfired.
And yet it worked.

We slowed down.

Reflected.

Responded.

Proved we're a team. For Henry.

You look terrible, Herr Gynt.

Oh.

- Sorry, a lot of long nights.
- Yeah, it's fine.

Dante was an absolute liability
when their younger was small.

Just forgot the Dewey Decimal System,

despite it literally being printed
on every aisle, in Braille.

She's being nice to me.

Weird to think disclosing
one's shit childhood could do that.

Hers must not have been
exactly roses either.

You have a kid, right?

- Mm-hm.
- How do you balance it?

She's with her dad these days.

And she throws that away. Curious.

Guess I don't need to ask if you've heard

about the whole awful Gil Brigham thing.

Yeah. Yeah, it's terrible.

Truly.

Does mean we need a new reader.

- You still interested?
- Sure.

- Of course.
- Great.

Oh, and I have a new rec for you.

David Copperfield.

You know, hardscrabble orphan
down on his luck.

Figured you could relate.

She's teasing me, isn't she?

- Ha.
- Anyway, if you wanted to apply

your wizard-level book repair skills,
have at it.

It's almost like
you're flirting with me?

No. No, you wouldn't.
Well, not consciously.

This necklace thing, nervous habit?

Why would you be nervous unless...?
It couldn't be about me. Could it?

You okay there, Joe?

Oh, shit. What was I just doing?

- I'm totally fine.
- Great.

I cannot be thinking
about you like this. No.

No, no, no. This is bad.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

I have a plan.

Mrs. Engler was involved
in an extramarital relationship

with Gil Brigham.

In a written letter, Mr. Brigham confessed

that he murdered Mrs. Engler
and disposed of her remains.

Find the people that get you.

- How do you know who those people are?
- You just do.

I can't be thinking
about you like this. No.

You okay there, Joe?

Oh, no. This is bad.

We've really turned a corner.
We barely fight anymore.

And when we disagree,
we discuss it directly, then we move on.

Guess you could say we're just

- a normal, boring suburban family.
- Whoo!

She said boring. Not me.

Everything's fine.

Sure, little bit of a yawn.

Oh, it's been six months.

- And we don't know how to say this.
- Come on, Love. Spit it out.

Do we need to keep coming?

I know we're already down
to every other week,

but we rarely have anything
to talk about with you.

Or with each other.

Is this financial?

We talked about your mom buying
the vineyard and you feeling strapped.

- No, business is good.
- Love is being modest.

The bakery is a huge success.

I can't believe I'm so happy here.

I'd never call Love a pod person,

but let's just say she's assimilated.

- Joe? How have you been?
- Oh, I'm fine.

Bored, trapped in Pleasantville,
aging so fast,

I forget to jack off in the shower.

I'm good.

Work is good.

- Uh, I've really gotten into lawn care.
- Oh, my God.

- He is obsessed with the lawn.
- The lawn is the foyer to the home.

My love of our glorious foyer is genuine.

After Gil, I realized there's a price
to pay if you want a stable life.

And I am happy

to forego excitement and chaos for that,
to be the husband and father I want to be.

I can do it, for Henry. I'm great at it.
Lawn mowers are very fun.

Joe's been having
a harder time making friends here.

Excuse me?

I have plenty of friends.
I do, at the library.

- Any friends you don't work with?
- Well, no.

Everyone else is an asshole.

Let me tell you what Love is not saying.

Not having friends puts
a lot of pressure on a partner.

- Do you feel pressure, Love?
- Yes.

She does?

One person cannot fulfill all our needs.

It's crucial to have friends
outside a marriage.

It takes some of that pressure off.

I don't see great candidates
for BFF here in Madre Linda, but...

Okay.

I will try harder.

I'm annoyed, but promises are easy
when your priorities are clear.

Make our marriage work.

So our time's almost up, but I should ask.

How's your sex life been?

- It's good.
- It's great.

It's great. I should have said great.

Wait.

Ah. Not again.

Hold on, I just...

- I need a sec.
- Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

I'm tired anyway.

Remember what we used to say? I wolf you.

Yeah.

We should bring that back.

We also never rip each other's clothes off

and fuck like wildcats anymore.

We've been domesticated.

- I'm sorry about...
- No, it's fine.

I wolf you.

Wolf? We're dog-on-a-leash now.

This is fine. It's normal.

It's fine.

And if it feels like it's not,
maybe I'm the problem.

Maybe you and Dr. Chandra are right.

My introvert tendencies are
the reason I feel off.

Joe, mm, can you tilt your chin forward?

But did you have
to make Sherry your best friend?

Oh, my God.

The camera is loving Henry's authenticity.

Um... Guys, are we sure
puppies is the right theme for the party?

I'm not usually indecisive. It's just...

Sherry keeps saying that...

Parties indicate your child
and family are socially adjusted

and an integral part of the community.

And a critical part
of getting into The Ashman School,

Madre Linda's premiere private Pre-K.

- Shoot me.
- We're doing everything right.

Joe, no one wants
to go to a birthday party

where Daddy looks
like a Cymbalta commercial, okay?

So, Love, let's get
some singles over here,

and, Joe, just shake it off.

Just shake it off.

Come on.

Something about fitting
into suburbia has changed you, Love.

You went from being horrified
by the ostentatiousness of a kids party

- to Keeping Up With The Conrads.
- The other side.

And yet, you make belonging look
so effortless.

- You do seem happy.
- No Cymbalta here.

Why do I still feel
so on the outside?

Joe, come over here, sweetie.
The vibe is much better.

- Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

I think Theo's visiting home.

Theo.

Yes! Yes!

Finally!

We got it.
These invitations are gonna be adorable.

Yeah.

- Thank you so much, Sherry. Really.
- Yeah.

Joe, I like it when you appreciate me.

Oh, my gosh.

If you could see his hair.

Mari, do me the favor of describing.

Oh, my.

Okay.

Whole vibe's very
Patrick-Bateman-meets-Venetian-gondolier.

Oh, okay. Right. Let me just go fix it.

Oh, no, no. No. Wait, wait.

Dante, cover the floor?

Okay, here's one.

Favorite classic fantasy series.
Let's say 1970s through '90s?

Okay. Give me a minute.

Yes, I notice Marienne in that way,
but I cut it off instantly.

I'm married, so she and I are friends.

Am I supposed to feel bad
that I'm friends with people at work?

Dragonriders of Pern, maybe.

Okay.

But, you know, as a kid, I hid them.
I was afraid they were for girls.

Why? It's dragons fighting space worms.
That is not gender-specific.

- Trying to fit in is the worst.
- Exactly.

- How is this helping your portrait?
- Who said I was doing a portrait?

Well, I mean, I guess, sort of.

I had been working on this sketch
of the Little Prince and the Fox.

Couldn't get the Fox,
and your vibe today inspired me.

It's for this illustration contest
put on by this fancy imprint,

and this year, it's reinterpret
a classic of children's lit.

"It's the time you lavished on your rose

that makes your rose so important."

Hmm.

Um, anyway, I probably won't
even submit, so...

You have a habit of talking yourself out
of things. Is this something you do often?

All right, Sigmund Freud,
sit back and sit still, please.

I thought this wasn't a portrait.

- So why The Little Prince?
- Just always loved it.

Translations never do it justice,

but the original will always be
my favorite.

Do you speak French?

- My first language. I was born in Paris.
- You don't have an accent.

You wanna be friends
with people who can surprise you.

I moved when I was young,

and it's really just
not that interesting a story, so...

Maybe to her.

Why so wary?

So scared to be seen.

That's what I want in friends,
to be inspired to wonder.

Joe?

- Who is she?
- Show me.

Your drawing.

It's going to be beautiful.

- Thank you.
- Marienne, you have to submit this.

No, no, no.

Did I learn nothing from Natalie?
Why am I holding this?

Put the bracelet down.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

I mean, you look paler than usual,
and that's saying something.

No, everything's fine.

Okay.

Shit. Feeling drawn
to Marienne is just a symptom.

The problem is me, running away from
my perfectly good life and devoted wife.

So, if I'm the problem, how do I fix it?

Smells good, bro.

But the key to truly orgasmic BBQ
is catching the meat yourself.

Yeah, you mentioned.

Six times.

But it's okay because look at you.

Happy wife, happy life, right?

What could say more about my commitment

than agreeing to dinner
with the fucking Conrads?

If putting up with Cro-Magnon man gets
the tips you need

to make Henry's party a success,
I'm all in because I am all in, damn it.

- Are you sure you don't want a top off?
- Ugh. It won't kill me.

Ugh.

That one.

I heard he's on probation at school
for showing up to a midterm drunk.

- Oh.
- Thanks.

Imagine what his grades look like.

Actually, I thought he was doing okay.

That one's determined to self-destruct.

He got arrested in high school, two DUIs.

Just a matter of time before he starts
cooking meth like Jessica Sherman,

winds up dead in a ditch.

Mm.

I mean, he seems like a good kid
in a tough situation,

- but I know you know him better than I do.
- No.

No, you're right.

- He just needs some better influences.
- Yeah.

Pretty capable in the kitchen,
Miss Quinn-Goldberg.

Next time we'll be hunting
the pigs ourselves.

Is that right?

That'd be my husband.

Better watch out, Joe.

Cary's gonna wind up dragging you
on his hunting trip tomorrow,

make you a better man.

Actually, there's a spot
with your name all over it.

It's just what you need, my friend,

to recharge those masculine batteries,
if you know what I mean.

- I do not.
- We hike. We hunt.

We don't have to restrain
our, uh, natural impulses.

It's an incredible feeling,

letting out that part of yourself
that you have to cage.

Unleashing my impulses
is the opposite of what I need to do.

No, thank you. Hard pass.

It sounds great, but I do think
that we have Henry's party...

No, no, no. It sounds great.
You should totally go.

Sherry and my mom can help
with party prep.

Be great for you
to get to know the guys better.

Saved by the bell.

We're almost to the day.
My brother's September 2nd.

- Theo.
- Hi.

You look nice.

- What are...? What are you...?
- Oh, I, um...

It's street cleaning tomorrow,
so thought I'd give you a heads-up.

Car's in the driveway.

Yeah, but to warn you
not to put them on the street.

Okay.

- Okay, wait. Wait, wait, Theo.
- Yeah.

Are...? Are you okay?

Yep.

Never better.

Really? Because I heard that...

Hey.

Why do I feel like I walked
into the middle of something?

Oh, by the way,
the lawn, it looks impeccable.

Richard Yates-level attention to detail.

He's read Yates?

- He's weirder than ever, huh?
- He's not weird.

He's a kid. Kids are weird.
Cut him some slack, okay?

Why are you acting so...? No, no, no.

Stop looking for trouble.
You are fine. I am the problem.

So why do I feel
like you're hiding something?

Dr. Chandra would say
I'm falling into old patterns. No.

I'm committed
to being a good husband and father.

That involves things like lawn care

and making sure there are
no fraudulent charges from hotels

where you're conducting an affair
with the stepson of the woman you killed.

Yeah, I know how crazy I sound...
Love! What the fuck?

One, two...
Twelve Uber charges in Palo Alto?

Are ride-shares
the seedy motels of NorCal?

How the fuck did I miss this?

Hey. He's down.

What? Something wrong?

Do you know about
these Uber charges in Palo Alto?

Are you asking me or accusing me?

I'm calling the credit card company
to cancel. I just wanted to make sure.

Sometimes Theo texts me when he's drunk
and I get him an Uber.

What?

Nobody looks out for him, Joe.

And with Matthew,
it's good to keep a line open.

Is there something else
you're not telling me?

Love?

- Okay, he kissed me.
- He kissed you?

Yeah. It was before he left for school.
I mean, obviously, I shut it down.

- That's shutting it down?
- Don't yell.

- You've been sneaking around.
- That's crazy.

You made me feel
like something's wrong with me.

And I've done everything you asked.
You've been lying to me this whole time!

What the fuck was that, Joe?

You are clearly not happy.

I hope this weekend helps you get
your shit together. Something has to.

Being with men
in the woods is not my thing,

but I couldn't say no to you
after what I did, so here I am.

You can go on ahead without me if you...

Nah, no man left behind.

Cary and I made that pact at 'Manjaro.
He carried me up the Barranco Wall.

Kilimanjaro. What an amazing...
How much longer to the campsite?

Nothing bonds you like the altitude shits.

Why is male small talk so terrible?

'Manjaro was such an eye-opener.
When I got back,

Kiki and I started unschooling the kids.

Unschooling?

It advocates for child-chosen activities

instead of textbook-based learning.

Books can be the worst.

Mind-confiners, right?

Cary's the expert, even though
Sherry's all in on The Ashman School.

I respect how they make it work.

Can I tell you something?

Cary saved my marriage.

I made all this money in my 20s.
Didn't have to work, so I stayed home.

I loved being the kids' unteacher.
But, also, I was...

I just didn't feel like a man.

I was angry all the time.

I came here broken.

Cary helped me embrace my inner beast.

To grunt and breathe and scream and...

And cry.

To let go.

All's fine and well for this guy,
his inner beast's a Persian kitten.

Letting go is scary.

It's something about these woods,
with these men, that makes it feel safe.

I'm excited for you.
Your life's about to change.

How coddled was his life
to believe he's safe among men?

I wasn't even safe among boys.

You like that shit, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

Oh, this is so fun. This is so fun.

You're gonna cry for your mommy too, huh?
Just like your buddy Joe!

You okay?

Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I'm in worse shape than I thought.

...if you hadn't been snacking
the whole time...

You know what?

Welcome to the Promised Land!

- You went all out.
- His minions went all out.

Got here hours ago.

It started off as a hike
and ended as a run.

Way too much energy. Yes!

Claim your digs.

Then we'll gather more wood.
I'm glad you're here, boys.

Let's go.

Faith over fear. It's time to check out,
so we can check in.

Let's hydrate! We're gonna do
some sweating, boys.

Mm-mm.

Rule number two. Only food we eat
is what we kill ourselves.

We'll go over the rules at dusk.

What is this,
Fight Club in the redwoods?

- I haven't eaten all day.
- Yeah.

Let me tell you a story.

One time I got caught in a 'lanche,
split-boarding at 'Hoe.

In the snow two hours
before they rescued me.

Most suffocate in five minutes.

If I can survive that,
pretty sure you can survive this.

Let me translate.

Cary got stuck in an avalanche in Tahoe.

Must we abbreviate everything? Confusing.

Who's got the arms to gather fuel with me?

I'm on it.

Chop-chop. Let's run.

Yeah! Let's do this!
Fire is life, boys. Fire is life.

- You actually like these trips?
- I like that Andrew likes them.

No, in all honesty, they really have been
a savior for our marriage.

I'm sorry.

How?

We come undone.

The first time I came out here,
I wept like a baby.

All it took was trying to make fire.
Some make it farther before they break.

Why would anyone wanna get to that point?

Your kid hasn't reached the terrible twos

or my personal favorite,
the fucking fours,

but he still has tantrums?

Henry's an overachiever in that area.

So don't you ever wanna scream
and cry and break shit?

Cary says this trip's about being a man.
I think it's about being a kid again.

Hmm.

Here.

You can have a meaningful experience
while maintaining

a normal blood-sugar level.

Thank you.

Hello. Welcome. What can I get you?

Uh, yeah, can I get one of everything?

Oh. I forgot my wallet again.

Ugh.

Well...

That's all right.

On the house. Study fuel.

Mm.

I'm actually taking some time off.

To process the whole Natalie thing.

You could have told me
you were struggling.

No, I couldn't 'cause you drew a line.

- No more e-mails, only Ubers.
- Right.

Thank you.

But, um...

I am worried about you.

Are you?

'Cause I've been worried about you.

I... I heard your husband yelling at you
the other night,

and I know that we are, like...

Whatever,
but if you need someone to talk to...

- Yeah, I have friends for that.
- Right.

Sherry Conrad.

- We have more in common than you think.
- You're both human women.

Totally.

Come on, she's, like, an inch deep.

You're only friends
because she's the only option in town.

It's not a crime to fit in, Theo.

Maybe you'll understand that
when you're older.

You've changed.

That's not always a bad thing.

Enjoy the muffins. Okay?

I learned this mating call
outside of Cartagena.

Three minutes later, a doe popped out
of the brush, started nuzzling my cock.

Will it ever stop?

All right, let's go. Circle up!

Rules!

One, we already know, make our own fire.
Well done, my brothers.

Whoo!

Two, we only eat what we kill.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Three, issue with a fellow hunter?
You fight it out.

Four, no phones, no shirts. No exceptions.

Other than that,

no rules!

- Yeah!
- Grunt!

Scream!

Embrace your inner beasts!

- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

Yes!

Come on! Let's go, Goldberg!
I'm gonna get you dirty tonight, boy.

Shit.

Love, you had your tribe in L.A.
You even found one here.

But if this is my pack,
I think I'm meant to be a lone wolf.

You ready to feel like a high-speed,

low-drag apex motherfucking predator
out there?

Shit.

Thattaboy.

Now listen to that drum.

Huh?

How does it make you feel?

Appropriative.

You've been disconnected for so long
that your manhood is literally shrinking.

Love told Sherry about your dick issues.

You told her?

Come on.

Feel that.

You feel alive right now, don't you?

And you want more.

Tell me I'm wrong.

He's wrong.

It's fine.

I do, yeah.

You're my charge tonight, Joe.
I'm not letting you leave my side.

Now we hunt.

I can't believe they said no presents.

At least I won't be paying
for his therapy.

Got any more wine?

Hello?

Theo, I can't talk.

You're where?

Keep up the pace, Goldberg.

I didn't give you permission to stop.
Beasts don't stop.

Faster.

- Wait. Hang on. I need a second.
- Boo-hoo. Get up.

- I need a minute.
- There are no time-outs in life.

On your feet.

Jesus Christ.
Does your penis have mounds on it?

No. I am not that guy,
as much as Cary deserves it.

Quiet.

- You hear that?
- What?

Oh, what the fuck now?

Wait here.

Things aren't gonna work out
between me and Cary.

I'd say now is my chance to escape.

But if he doesn't come back, I'll starve,

or be eaten by whatever I'm hunting.

This is what I get for being a pacifist.

Woo-hoo!

- Uh... No.
- Take it.

- Take the squirrel.
- No.

- Kill it.
- No, no, no.

Are you okay with your life as it is?
If you wanna get your dick up again...

- I don't see how the two are related.
- It's about being a man!

Let go of the squirrel. You're hurting it.

Yeah. You think I'm a bully?

Fine.

You know the rules.

"You got a problem with a fellow hunter,

you fight it out."

Come on, Joe.
I'm gonna need you to hit me.

No one is coming to save you, you pussy.

I'm not playing this scene
from this movie.

Come on, bro! Clock me, motherfucker!

What you gonna do, Goldberg?

Fucking hit me!

Now!

Oh, shit.

No one is coming to save you.
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

Don't!

- Help. Help.
- What happened?

- Cary...
- He fell.

Is he okay?

- He fell.
- Shit.

Hey! No phones.

Are you serious? This is an emergency.

- He's not breathing.
- Shit, there's no signal.

- He's dead.
- We don't know that.

What's going on? Oh, God.

We don't know that. He might not be.

Come on. Come on.

- Come on!
- What are we gonna do?

Come on, wake up.

Wake up.

What are you doing, Goldberg?

You saving me?

I'm fucking moved, man.

- Oh, my God. You're alive.
- Of course I'm alive.

Been taking glutathione for a decade.

I'm impossible to kill.

Ooh.

And this fucking guy...

He's gonna tell them
I threw him off a fucking cliff,

that I'm crazy, whatever
the opposite is of "part of the tribe."

Goldberg is a fucking animal.

Come here.

You are one fine specimen of a man, Joe.

Let it out.

Yes, Joe. Let it out.
Good man. That's it. You got this.

You got this. This is your 'Manjaro.

- There he is.
- You're good.

Welcome to the other side.

You got this. Yeah!

I came to the woods,
afraid of the darkness inside me,

but they saw it

and accepted me anyway.

Is this what it feels like
to have friends?

Fitting in is not always the worst.

Yes, they're silly. Yes, what happens
out here is fucking nuts.

All I know...

is I feel like me again.

- I didn't think it would take so long.
- You could have killed yourself.

- Or someone else.
- That might be stretching it.

- You don't know that!
- I was driving a scooter.

An electric scooter.

Ah.

They arrested you
for driving drunk on a scooter?

Yeah.

You ever been on one?

- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

- Ready for the hill?
- Yeah.

We're charging the hill.

Let's go!

Oh, fuck.

- Ow.
- See? It's not that easy.

Is it?

I can't believe
I've never done that before.

Well, you know, it is a perfectly
socially-acceptable way

for adults to get around now, FYI.

Um...

So the rumors about...

me taking a leave of absence
because of Natalie...

Um...

They're not true.

I...

I'm flunking out because...

I can't stop thinking about you.

If you want me to shut up, I will.
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

I'm just trying to figure out...

how I can focus when all I want is you.

Theo, shut up.

No.

It's like you're playing house.

But none of this actually makes you happy.

I'm playing house?

You're a teenager chasing
after a married woman.

What's your endgame?

Did you go to the bakery
for that frosting tip or Alaska?

I got distracted
with the sourdough starter.

I saw that boy get out of your car.

What are you doing?

It's nothing. I'm just helping him out.

You missed Henry's first steps.

What?

You might have seen
if you'd picked up when I FaceTimed you.

Oh, he's down for the night now.

Love, Love,

all parents make mistakes.

God knows I did.

I missed my son's first steps.

It was anticlimactic.

I don't even think
I really remember yours.

What the fuck am I even doing?

I mean, I'm happy here.

- Everything's fine if Joe would just be...
- Blame Joe all you want.

The truth is, you preferred him
when he was a problem to fix.

You like someone to save.

It's the dynamic you had
with your brother.

So let me be blunt. Grow up.

That boy will distract you from your son.

I know you love Henry,
but that doesn't mean you won't harm him.

Here, have some of my cab sauv.

Much healthier addiction than a teen boy.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
my crush Rachel Maddow is waiting.

This is very impressive.

Hey. Hi. Wow, you made it home on time.

Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

I'm...

I think
Henry's a little young for hunting.

These are gifts from Cary.

They're for us. His and hers.

Huh.

Wow.

Hey.

Hi, hi.

- Hey, you smell bad.
- Yeah, I know, it's awful.

I'm gonna shower,
but first, I need to apologize.

- No. Joe...
- I have been working so hard

to keep myself in line,

I forgot there are healthy ways
to let things out.

I'm sorry I didn't tell you about...

You don't need to tell me everything.

I trust you.

- Wow. That was some weekend you had.
- Yeah. Really, it was.

Fuck, okay, okay.

- People are here. Get a shower real quick.
- Yeah.

Okay.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I can't remember a time
when I didn't long for someone

who totally accepted me.

The bad with the good.

Why is it that a person who can do that
always comes at a cost?

Your friend Paulie's doing better.

Thought you might wanna know.

If you'd given it back to that bully,
I wouldn't have told on you.

It's what he deserves.

- I chickened out, I guess.
- Yeah.

'Cause you're not like him.

I know what it feels like
to get picked on.

I'm sorry, it's not fair.

We'll look out for each other.

Deal?

Deal.

You were right, Love.
This party wasn't just about him.

We did it. We kept him safe.

Doesn't mean he'll happy all the time,
it just means we're here for him,

no matter what.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

You're an animal.

I think we're gonna have to get...

somebody to...

soundproof the bedroom.

- I think I know a guy.
- Mm-hm.

What?

- Fuck.
- What is it?

Fuck. The bakery. The alarm's been off
for, like, four hours.

It's probably okay.

- What if someone...?
- Look, I'm sure the sensor's

- just on the fritz, but I'll go. I got it.
- Yeah?

I really got it.

And by that,
I'm afraid what I really mean...

is that I used primitive tools
to carve out the time and space I need

to go on a certain kind of hunt.

I'll admit, this is all a bit elaborate.
And this ploy will only fool you once.

But after what happened with Natalie,
you can't blame me for covering my tracks.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, my God.

Oh, fuck.

Cary actually taught me
an important lesson, Love.

I can't completely cage
what's inside of me

or, when it bursts out,
it comes for blood.

Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

keep it on a leash, take it out for walks,

but make sure it knows the rules.

No keepsakes.

Are you okay?

No social media, just watching.

So now I have you, Marienne.

Arms always full of books.
Never leaving the library before dark.

No one to hurry home to.

We're just friends.

So, what is it about you?

I can't pin it down.

All I know is that I've felt more alive
these past few days watching you

than I have in a long, long time,
Marienne.

But... you can trust me
with this secret, Love.

Juggling the two of you is confusing,
I'll admit.

But I'm up for the challenge.

You won't find out.

You can't.

I'll be careful. So, so careful.

Things will be different this time.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

What are you doing, Love?

That boy will distract you from your son.

I can't cage what's inside of me.

Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

but make sure it knows the rules.

So now I have you, Marienne.

Things will be different this time.

Oh.

If you look up "klutz,"
there's a picture of me.

Oh.

Okay.

Here's what I've learned about you
in the last few days, Marienne.

You like things that make you feel.

You're whimsical and artsy. You don't like
things that go together too perfectly.

You find beauty in the flaws.

Unexpected pairings.

You're deep, reverent, rooted,

yet adventurous.

You're at home in chaos,
but something tells me not by choice.

You take care of books
and art and young minds,

but who takes care of you?

No. No, no, no. This is not why I'm here.

I'm here, well,
to figure out why I'm here.

Why you, Marienne?

So I must leave everything as I found it.

I like following you.
You're interesting and unpredictable.

And that inner part of me
that needs this is mostly satiated,

but in the spirit of self-awareness
and maybe conquering that inner thing,

I ask again,

why am I drawn to you?

Great! Yeah, sure.

Shit.

Oh, all right.

Okay.

Okay, great.

Home early.
It's very unusual for you.

Yes, yes, I know that place.

Okay. Yeah, great. I'll see you there.

What's got you stepping
out of your routine?

I dearly hope it doesn't involve
pegging someone on this bed. RIP Peach.

Okay, now you're just playing with me.

Lipstick.

Are you going on a date?

My wife.

I deserve this.

Aw, Daddy's still working.

She's the best wife ever...

while I'm doing this.

All to prove you aren't worth it.

You are just a fleeting crush.

- Dad, hey, what...?
- Hi.

What about Tokyo?
You said you'd be away till next month.

Yeah. Team's wrapping things up, so...

Okay, well, congrats
on your sudden ability to delegate.

Thank you.

So, like, you forgot
to sleep over there, or...?

I just got off a long flight, Theo.

- It's good to have you home.
- Good to be home.

Did you wanna ask why I'm here?

Of course.

Of course.

- What happened at school?
- Decided to take some time off.

With everything that happened,
felt like it was starting to get to me.

Hey, that's okay.

I can understand.

- We could go grab some food.
- I can't. I've got stuff to do inside.

Yeah, yeah. For sure.

Remember when we crashed Dad's
beloved Maserati? We were all banged up.

But better to suffer in silence
than let him know what we did.

This feels like that.

Only, I can't take this damaged thing
to the wrong side of town

and claim someone stole it.

I cheated on my soul mate.

What's wrong with me, Forty?

If you were here, you'd laugh.
You said I'd be a terrible mom.

Number two might be in me as we speak,
and there's no one I can tell that...

I'm not sure I want it.

Stop insinuating.

It's not Theo's baby.

Couldn't be, I don't think.

What am I doing?

Your phone is dead in my nightstand
because you are dead.

And no one will ever read this.
So, what am I confessing for?

Speaking of terrible mothers...

Ugh. The last thing I need is a weekend
all about Dottie and her second act.

I wish you were here.

I need you.

âª The visions never stop âª

âª These ribbons wrap me up âª

âª But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut âª

âª In your car, the radio up âª

âª In your car, the radio up âª

âª We keep tryin' to talk about us âª

âª I'm someone, you may be my love... âª

Oh, my God. Theo, stop it!

What the fuck?

What the fuck are you doing?

Thought that would get your attention.
This shit's romantic as fuck.

- What are you talking about?
- According to all the rom-coms

of your generation,
this is what the guys do to get the girl.

First of all, I'm not that old.
And this is not a game, Theo.

Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Sorry.
I don't know what to do.

But you're ignoring me.

I just... I need your advice

'cause you're the only person
that I actually trust.

So my dad's back.

He's already sequestered in his office.

And I just...

I don't know.

I don't know what to do.

He's not doing well.

Yeah. Your dad is grieving, Theo.
It's a roller coaster that doesn't end.

I was just texting my dead brother.

- Come here.
- What? No.

Just go take care of your dad.

I know he can be a dick,
but try to see where he's coming from.

I bet it's not a bad place.

Okay.

Can I ask you one more thing?

Sure.

Do you think of me
during sex with your husband?

- Seriously?
- Because yours is the only face I see.

You need to leave.
Go take care of your dad.

Do I deserve this?

Is this new baby a gift or a punishment?

God, that sounds terrible. Am I terrible?
Why did I do it, Forty, if I'm so happy?

- Need help over there?
- No, I got it.

Smells amazing.

I don't deserve him.

I don't deserve her.

She's making food,
so I'm nourished all weekend,

and here I am counting the minutes
till she's gone so I can follow you.

- Perfect bite. Ready?
- Ooh.

Oh, yeah.

Mm.

Let me be clear. You fascinate me.

But Love is my soul mate,

mother of my child,

love of my life.

And my job as a husband
and a father is to keep it that way.

I'm happy.

Of course you are.

Your mind's on nothing but your wife.

All the time.

Hey, you okay?

Yeah.

Yeah.

How do you get it so fucking moist?

Come show me.

Yeah. Just like that.

That was great.

That was so great.

I appreciate you taking
this meeting face-to-face.

I like to know I can put you in a headlock
when I'm not getting through to you.

A loving headlock.

I can only assume
the best part of this is now behind us.

I'd appreciate if you tell me
before you hire an investigator

to look into your wife's case
that's closed.

- Is it? You bought that?
- What did he find?

He tell you
the neighbors' daughter's a coke dealer?

Wanna take a look?

- Help yourself.
- Oh.

Bottom-line it, anything remotely
interesting in all this guy's work?

One thing that's interesting to me
is your neighbor, the baker,

Quinn of the L.A. Quinns,

meaning she probably has her own PIs
who know what you're up to.

And the most litigious father this side
of Republicans whining for a recount.

Except Ray Quinn, he wins.

- I haven't broken any laws.
- A look this bad should be illegal.

You mean, my trying to figure out
who murdered my wife? Can you imagine?

You do understand what will happen
when the townspeople learn

you're having them investigated?

They'll make noise.

- Great.
- No, not great.

I just spent six months trying to put
some light between this company

and words like marital affair, murder.

- Different lanes.
- I'm not disappearing your ass

back to Tokyo while I spend another six
putting out more fires you've lit.

Different fucking lanes!

This isn't about the company.

Oh, because you and the company I protect
aren't at all the exact same thing?

Listen, I...

I understand that you're grieving.
That's reasonable.

Grieve.

But this?

This will cost not just you
but every person who works for you.

You'll destroy lives for nothing

because the worst offense
the townspeople are guilty of is

tacky athleisure.

It stops now. You get that, right?

âª If you cover my mouth with your hands âª

âª Try to silence me âª

âª I'll scream out as loud as I can âª

âª Shouldn't bite the hand that feeds me âª

âª But you're not the man âª

âª And when I stick it to you
We'll see who's dramatic âª

âª You say that I'm safe âª

âª While you look for someone... âª

Alrighty.

Thank you.

âª I think you're a bit too late... âª

Maybe I'll actually get
some answers this weekend. God, I hope.

Changing lives is my passion.

That's why I bought Casa Gaia Vineyard
and intend to make it a hub

for transformation

and organic, biodynamic fine wines.

Course, Dottie befriends Sherry

and her billion followers.

Lot of chances to sell mommy-juice.

These women are about to experience
a defining moment in their lives.

The Women Optimizing Motherhood
and Business Summit

will set a path into the future.

Hashtag "W.O.M.B."

I'm drowning in her estrogen.

Now let's toast.

To womanhood, motherhood

and the entrepreneurial spirit.

And cut. Yes!

That was perfection.
I'll check this file and AirDrop you.

The Internet is gonna swoon
when you post this.

- Thank you for being here.
- Hey, Sherry.

- Sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

- Did the nursery take our little man?
- Practically took him out of my hands.

This could not have come at a better time.
You look exhausted.

It begins.

Yeah, I haven't made it to my room yet
but thank you.

Trust me. Come Monday, you will be
the picture of relaxation. Want some?

I'm good.

Not pregnant, are you?

- Keep it together. She smells fear.
- I'm on a mini detox.

You are? Oh, my God.

- Is it Joe's or that neighbor kid's?
- Keep your voice down. I was...

I have seconds before kickoff.
We'll finish this later.

Maybe a little lipstick, sweetheart?
You're pale.

Remember pretending to be orphans?

That was fun.

Your work face, giving nothing away.

Excuse me. Where's Narnia?

Oh, it's in Kid Lit.
You see that tree over there?

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

You're leaving mid-shift?
Could this be opportunity knocking?

Hey, Dante.

Marienne asked me to take care
of the overdue notices?

Was that at the desk here?

Her office. She'll be back in an hour.

Okay. I think she meant while she's out.

So diligent...

after taking three hours
to shelve that one cart this morning.

Thank you.

Okay.

Doesn't exactly scream skeletons
but then neither do you.

There's nothing in your work files
or search history.

It's just, there's no "you" here at all,

which tells me
I'm not looking hard enough.

Hmm. "Recovery." This is a surprise.

This deepens my curiosity,
and now I need more.

"Child endangerment"?

"Neglect."

"Abuse."

This can't be right.

The ex-husband, I presume.

The more I know,

the less I understand.

Who are you?

What I do know,

your problems are serious.

You're a mess.

I have a loving wife, a son.

I can't have anything to do
with your red flags.

This itch has been scratched.

"What did I want? A tarnished
marriage that takes so much work to heal?

A family that consumed me?

No, I deserved better.

All at once,
I knew what that looked like."

What does it look like?

"I realized I had more to offer."

And so, I started writing.

Eventually, I started my own company,

and it was hard.

It was exhausting.

But if I could do it, you can too.

That's it?

All right. Who has a question?

- Yes, right here.
- Given all you've accomplished,

how do you stay so humble?

Is she joking?

I start the first half hour
of every morning expressing gratitude.

A great way to remember that none of us
can get through this life without help.

All right. Who's next?

If you're supposed to be giving us
the secret of joy,

what is it?

I don't hear you saying
what a 21st-century professional mother

is supposed to do to find happiness.

Simple.

If you focus on watering your own grass,

you never have to wonder
if it's greener anywhere else.

But what does that mean? I...
I water my own grass, and I don't...

- Okay, next.
- It's fine. You don't what?

You don't feel how incredibly green
your own grass is?

Is it possible
that you don't wanna succeed?

That you feel guilty for what you have
and you sabotage your happiness?

I would suggest a look inward
and read my book.

To read more about your narcissistic climb
to success, when, poof,

you suddenly discovered
you were deserving?

Sounds like privileged bullshit to me.

I'm not sorry.

She doesn't know what she's talking about.
I do want to succeed, obviously, right?

You are powerful. You are loved.
You are forgiven.

Mm. Thank you.

I am sorry.

- We've moved on.
- It's not too late to turn the day around.

Sherry had the brilliant idea, we do
an IGTV interview with each other and...

We want you to be a part of it.

- Interview for what?
- Our brands.

But also to counteract
your little outburst.

You were right about one thing.

Women need to see other successful women
supporting each other.

How better to use our privilege, right?

Hashtag "You can sit with us."

Sure.

Hello, goddesses.

I'm at the W.O.M.B. Summit

with Heart-Shaped Mistakes creator

and fellow twin mom Sherry Conrad.

Sherry,

your blog moves me.

But it's your heart
that really touches me.

Oh, Dottie.

Oh, woof.

You are a shining light for us all.

- Thank you for being my soul sister.
- Vomit emoji.

And last but not least,

my pride and joy, Love Quinn-Goldberg.

I'm so proud to have raised a daughter
whose grit nearly matches my own.

- Nearly?
- Doing it all.

Husband, business, 1-year-old,
all with possibly another on the way.

Oh, my God, Mom.

- Oh, my God, Love! Amazing!
- What the fuck?

- What are you doing?
- Sherry, give us a second.

- Love, I just...
- Seriously, get the fuck out.

Thank you.

How the hell could you do that?
I'm not sure. I haven't told Joe.

It's not surprising. The problems
in your marriage keep stacking up.

Mom, it has nothing to do with you.

My life, my marriage, my womb,

none of your fucking business,
and not to share on social media.

- Don't speak to me like that.
- Somebody has to.

You're the reason
Forty and I are fucked up.

- Don't talk about him.
- No wonder that our life turned into this.

All you ever showed me
was to get the prince,

build a castle,
and then burn it all to the ground.

Says the princess who was given all
the mattresses in the world to sleep on

and still complains she can feel a pea.

I gave you the world,

you ungrateful, little bitch.

You have no idea
what I had to do to give it to you.

Your choice to fuck the neighbor boy
or blow up your life

has nothing to do with me and everything
to do with you being spoiled and bored.

I'll take the blame for spoiling you.
But the source of your unhappiness?

Look in the mirror instead of spouting
your hypocrisy at everyone else.

Dad, I got you dinner.

Dad?

Come on, you can be mad at me,
but at least eat something.

What the fuck?

Almost ready to go, Goldberg?

No, you go ahead. I'll close up.

The smell of your perfume could
erase everything I've learned today.

- Best to hang back for now.
- No way. You know the rules.

Do me a favor
and stay down there a sec, okay?

You hired a lawyer?

- Let's talk outside.
- No.

Is that your ex-husband?

No, you don't have any rights,
you fucking junkie.

That doesn't sound right.

- Listen to me...
- Get your hands off...

- Get your hands off me!
- No, no... Hey, no, we're not done.

Hey!

- What is going on here?
- Hey, man, I'm sorry. That...

This looks bad, right?
I knocked that over by accident.

It must have sounded crazy.

I'm... I'm Ryan Goodwin.

If I look familiar, Channel Three News.

I recognize you.
I think you should leave, Ryan.

Yeah, sure.

Sure.

Look, you know, exes.

- But the respect's there.
- Don't look at her. Just go.

Yeah.

Talk later, Mare.

- You okay?
- You shouldn't have done that.

I didn't ask for your help.

What part of "stay out of it"
did you not understand?

Was that too hard?

You really had to run up here
like some white knight

and get in the middle of my shit?

You're crazy!

Which is 100%
none of your goddamn business, Joe!

- You sick fuck!
- I see it now.

This is why "you."

- You're a pattern.
- Thought he'd be better this time.

If you look up "klutz,"
there's a picture of me.

You're a lost lamb
attracted to wolves.

- Ergo, what I feel...
- Just let me handle it.

...it's not because you're special, it's...
Wait for it. It's mother issues.

How's that for self-awareness?

Am I amusing you?

No, no, no. No.

I'm sorry. Also, I'm not sorry.

I'm not one to let bullies bully.
I would've done that for anybody.

Okay.

Fuck Dottie.

What's she know?
We were accessories to her.

A couple of purse dogs she'd overfeed,

then scream at
when we shit on her Gucci wallet.

Fuck Dottie.

I hate her.

I hate you too.

For leaving me with her.

You should've just eaten me
in the womb, Forty.

Did you just answer me?

What the fuck?

Forty?

God.

I am wasted.

So wasted.

Oh, my God. Forty!

Wait.

Are you really here?

Yeah, of course, Lovey.

I live inside you.

I'm always here.

âª Just call my name and I'll be there âª

All seriousness though,

how happy are we that I am
the only thing living inside you?

Dodged a bullet.

- Good job, vagina.
- Did I though?

Dodge a bullet? I mean...

I am relieved,

but, I don't know, I can't help but wonder
if maybe another baby would calm me down.

- Focus me a little.
- First of all, no.

And, B,

do you really think
focusing is what you need?

I thought I needed to get married.

Then move and start over.

Then a bakery.

Then someone who wasn't my husband.

I get it though. That kid is pretty cool.

Kind of reminds me of me.

Forty, I don't know what happened.

I fell so in love with Joe.

But now I don't... I don't even...

like him...

anymore.

I mean, he makes me feel bad for being me.

That's not how your soul mate's supposed
to make you feel, right?

I'm self-sabotaging, aren't I?

Yeah.

- Why can't I just be happy?
- Oh, Lovey.

You're not happy
because Joe isn't your soul mate.

I am.

There is one person

who understands
what you have been through.

I slept on those mattresses too.

I mean, that pea fucking killed me.

I am so sorry.

Don't be sorry for surviving.

You were the strong one.

You always knew
it was gonna turn out this way.

It's why you held me so tight.

âª I'll be there âª

âª I'll be there âª

âª Just call my name and I'll be there âª

Mommy issues.

I can't believe it's taken me this long.
I'm growing.

"The absence of burden causes man
to be lighter than air,

to soar into heights,
take leave of the earth, free.

What then shall we choose?
Weight or lightness?"

- Hey, what...?
- Hey. It's an emergency.

I'm sorry for calling so late.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- What happened?
- Sprinkler system malfunctioned.

I tried to get somebody to look at it,
now thousands of books are destroyed...

- and I'll lose my job.
- That won't happen.

Not your fault the county's too cheap
to invest in building upkeep.

You happen to have called
the best book doctor in the world,

so we'll figure out what's salvageable.

It'll be fine.

Okay. Well, I'm choosing to believe you.

This is about books.

For the love of books.

I would've done the same thing
if Dante called.

I'm sorry.

About earlier.
I know you were just trying to help.

I know it's no excuse,

but my ex-husband brings out my worst.

It's okay.

We're all works in progress.

"When you've been worked on for so long,
you never know you're done."

Jericho Brown.

You know his work?

What am I doing, using my old games
on you? I'm not this guy anymore.

I read his work in The New Yorker,
and that line... stayed with me.

But I don't know
his writing much, actually.

The way you've handled
those books. The care.

Only a mother... Oh, there. Yep.

Okay, stop.

But just to pass the time...

It's a personal question,
but we are technically off-hours.

Just ask it.

What's your daughter like?

Amazing.

Kind, funny,

likes to go out
and look for fairy rings at the park.

Excellent at finding them.

Loves to draw.

Like her mom.

Yeah, nothing in this world beats
the feeling of...

Of looking at your child

and knowing you're watching
someone grow up better than you.

How could you do anything
to hurt your child?

All I see is love.

Your turn.

- What's Henry like?
- Oh, he's a terrorist.

No, he's... He's adorable, he's sweet.
A big fan of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

No surprise,
you've seen him with the bottle.

I really hope he's better than me.

Why do you look like that?

I had this idea...

of happily ever after.

Perfect family, picket fence.
Now I have that.

I want what's best for my son.

I'm just worried that this suburban,
cookie-cutter existence isn't...

Isn't it. I know it's nothing compared
to your situation.

- I shouldn't be complaining.
- No, I get it.

Raising kids is a whole different game
once you've gone through the system.

Soon as you told me
you didn't come from money,

all of a sudden
I could just see it on you.

Yeah, I had been in a dozen foster homes
before I hit 18,

and still, even though I knew
it made no sense, I...

I never stopped thinking
my mom would show up and save me.

She never did, of course,

but sure made me wanna be
a better mom though.

I held on to that same hope.

For years.

And got my ass kicked regularly for it.

I think it kept me going.

But she never came back either.

I never talk about this with anyone,
not even Love.

Despite her best intentions,
she could only understand to a point.

But you understand completely.

Um...

We should get back to it.

What happened with Ryan?

I'm sorry.

I'm not okay with what I saw,

and I would like to know
how someone who treats you like that

could have custody of your child.

We were both addicts...

when Juliette was a baby.

One night, I...

I sailed through a red light.

And the other driver
was very seriously hurt,

and the way that we collided,
if Juliette had been on the other side...

Reckless endangerment of a child.

That disaster, and the fact
that he got clean before I did,

is how Ryan got full custody.

The lies he's told ever since is
how he's kept it.

The lies?

Well, you know, he's got money.

Beloved local celeb, a white man.

And I think we can both agree,
white men get a million chances in life.

So when he accuses me of child neglect,
for not showing up for my visitation,

they believe him.

Even when I swear
he gave me the wrong address.

He can have me arrested
for destruction of property

for keying his car that I barely scratched
'cause I chickened out.

And my favorite,

verbal and emotional abuse
for calling him a dickhead.

Yeah, and he's had this case built
against me for years,

and everyone believes him,

everyone takes his word over mine
because... who am I?

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry for what you've been through.

Nobody forced me
to get behind the wheel that night.

That's...

That's a choice I live with.

Yeah, but everything else,
Ryan manipulating the justice system,

somebody should stop him.

- I volunteer, happily.
- Well, I am working on it.

I just met a new lawyer
for dinner last night.

Lawyer. You weren't on a date.

He thinks joint custody is doable

if I can just show
how I'm really doing now

and the judge sees it.

If I was sure Ryan could never find us,
I would grab Juliette and run to Paris.

And spend our days
drawing outside SacrÃ©-CÅur.

That sounds magical.

For you.

Tragic for me to lose you.

I shouldn't have reduced you to my issues.
You're nothing like my mother.

You adore your child
and she should be with you.

You're just who you are.

You don't hide or embellish,
you own your mistakes

and stand up to the strikes
against you. You're so...

Oh! No! Please, no!

It's okay, look.

I think, it's... It's just us.

Oh, shit.

Love is gonna kill you.

Haven't really been yourself this weekend.

- You really pregnant?
- This is a hangover.

I'm not pregnant.

I'm sorry to hear that.

It's fine.

Then what's going on?

I don't know.

I'm just not happy.

And it's not Joe's fault.

He's just not my soul mate.

No one who tries to love you really
measures up when you're a twin.

Well, I know from my own twins,
you are absolutely right.

But the whole soul-mate thing,

it's mostly bullshit.

You choose your soul mate.

Cary and I,

we had some fundamental problems.

I didn't even like him for a while.

But I decided he was my person,

and I made it work.

Love, it's mostly chemicals.

Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin.

To activate all three,

exercise, eat some protein,
squeeze in eight hugs a day.

- Mm.
- When you're happy and healthy,

then you can make real choices.

And that includes choosing your life mate.

That easy, huh?

It is not easy.

But it is so worth it.

Dear Forty,

you've been my best friend
since before we were born.

My other half.

But I can't keep holding back
because I miss you.

I can't raise a family
with a broken heart.

I have to choose Joe now.

I'll always love you.

But I have to say goodbye.

For real this time.

As much as it hurts.

Goodbye, you.

The fuck? What are you doing here?

You called me.

You drunk-dialed me at 4 a.m.

I was worried, so I... So I Ubered.

I'm sorry.
I don't remember that happening.

Oh, wow.

It's proof
that I'm in your subconscious though.

Okay.

I can drive you home,
but I need you to listen.

I care about you a lot.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Can I just say something really quickly?

Sure.

My dad is a lot worse than I thought.

I went into his office,
and he hired a PI to stalk people.

And he has all this insane conspiracy shit

about Natalie's murder

with these names of people in Madre Linda,

including you and Joe.

What?

Nurse Fiona,
I think you'll like this. It's...

Wait for you outside, beautiful.

Hey, kid.

Love that book.

Sorry, today is not a good day.
I have to...

He gets mad at you and he hurts you.

He says he's sorry,
it'll never happen again,

and he gives you flowers, right?

There are a lot of bad men out there,

and sometimes you can't tell
until it's too late.

Go outside and eat with the other boys.

I know now, Marienne.
I know why "you," and it's no pattern.

But today starts the next phase

of my growth to know you exist,
to see you, to love you even,

and to never have you.

Because as long as I love you,
you'll be in danger.

Hi. Hi, can we talk?

- We have a lot to do today.
- You wanna forget what happened.

Go back to business as usual.
I can't go back.

It's only a matter of time before I'm
making treasure boxes for Love to find.

- Marienne...
- I have feelings for you.

I know nothing can happen.

You're married,
with the cutest baby on the planet,

and I'd never do anything
to split up a family,

and I need you to know that.

Not that you'd ever,

obviously, because...

you love your wife,

and we were just exhausted
and caught up in the moment.

So don't worry, I don't...
I don't want anything.

I just...

It can go away.
It can dissolve into nothing. Okay?

Cool?

Wait.

It's... It's not nothing.

I'd never break up your family.

- I'd never do anything to hurt Henry.
- I know.

I'd never get in the way
of you getting your family back.

- I would never hurt Juliette.
- I know.

Oh, no.

We can't do this.

I know.

Shit.

No, you...

- You have to go before this...
- I know. We can't.

I came here to quit.

I thought this would make it easier.

You don't have to do that.

But we should talk
when we're a bit more clear-headed.

I have never felt more clear-headed.

But I do need time to figure out
what I'm gonna do about Love.

I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

I will stay ahead of her this time.

- You're home early.
- Hey.

There you are. Did you not get my texts?

We need to talk.

She knows.
How the hell could she already know?

- Is everything okay?
- No.

Theo told me that Matthew hired a PI
to look into people.

He doesn't think Natalie's case is closed.

Okay. So, what does he have?

I don't know,
but I may be able to find out.

- How?
- We know Theo has a crush on me...

- And you wanna use that?
- Sort of.

Like, okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can shoot it down.

But I could... pretend
like he had a chance.

Like, 19-year-olds will do anything
if they think sex is on the table.

Well, this took a turn,

but if Love's focused on this,
she'll be too distracted to notice us.

I know, I was... It's crazy,
and I'm asking you for a lot of trust,

- but I really...
- It's a great idea.

I trust you.

We are a team.

The best team.

We are the best team.

Even if we're not soul mates,
it's a kind of love.

And it keeps her eyes somewhere else,
so the rest I can give to you.

This is great for everyone.

.......... ********** ..........

- Previously on You:
- Get your hands off me!

- I'm Ryan Goodwin.
- Go.

- If something's wrong, tell me.
- I'm buying a vineyard.

My dad is a lot worse than I thought.
I went into his office.

And he has
all this insane conspiracy shit,

including you and Joe.

We are a team.

The best team.

Marriage is a game.

When things are going well,

my wife and I are on the same side,
an unshakable team.

âª Sometimes you just wanna âª

- âª Feel good, feel good âª
- âª You know I like to âª

- âª Feel good, feel good âª
- âª I love it when you âª

- âª Feel good, feel good âª
- âª Hit it âª

- Love in the Time of Cholera?
- You got it.

- Oh, my God! That is impossible.
- Yeah!

- Go do it. Be better.
- Okay, I got this.

- Right now, my game...
- We are so good at this.

...is being a good husband... No, no.

No, the best husband,

so Love doesn't get suspicious
about what's really going on.

That I can't stop thinking about you,
Marienne.

It's been two days
since our sprinkler-soaked night.

You haven't texted, but I know better
than to overplay my hand.

All right, so far, so good.
He's gonna meet me to talk.

If I wasn't so in love with you, Marienne,

I might find this more upsetting,

but as it stands,
I have to play just jealous enough.

You had to deploy your lace bra for that?

Yeah.

I know it's all a bit spooky, but...
It also kind of feels like no big deal.

Is it just me
or doth the lady protest kind of a lot?

The sooner we find out
what Matthew could have on us,

if anything,
the sooner we can fix it, right?

She might be more attracted to Theo
than she's willing to admit,

but she's also right and distracted,

which is necessary to keep her
from Spidey-sensing you. Speaking of...

Oh, the library fundraiser is coming up.

My boss asked me to stay late
the next couple of nights.

Uh, I would have said no.

But I think that will make her
even more irritable than usual,

so I hope that's okay.

Yeah. I mean, of course. Should I...?
Should I put it in my calendar?

And have you both cross? No, no, no.

It'll be pretty boring.
I wouldn't want to inflict that upon you.

How'd I end up
with such a thoughtful husband?

This game is tricky.

Juggling you and Love won't be easy.

But if this is the game I have to play
to get closer to you, then game on.

Though you haven't texted me back,
Marienne,

I know you felt what I felt in the rain.

This seems elaborate.

Yeah, and Alice in Wonderland,
a story dear

to friends-of-the-library chairwoman
Sherry Conrad, which is fabulous...

You feel it right now.
You're pretending you don't.

And don't get me started
on how the friends of the library

only visit the library
when there's a gala.

You're cautious about us,
which is smart.

But it means
I need to be a little bit bold.

I thought about you all weekend.

Really?

Um...

'Cause I couldn't stop thinking
about those goats that faint

when they're startled.

You know, like, what the fuck, Darwin?

- I thought about you too. A lot.
- I knew it.

- But it can't happen again.
- And here's the speech.

Look, I gave it a lot of thought,
and for so many reasons,

- first and foremost being you're married...
- That's true.

But it's not that simple, I promise you.

I understand.

...that if I push too hard,
I risk losing you.

Mommy.

Hey, no running, remember?

Ryan surprised me
by dropping her here this morning,

but she's having so much fun helping out.

- Aren't you, mon petit chou?
- I didn't think it was possible,

but in her presence,
you are even more exquisite.

You must be Juliette.

Hmm?

- Look what Dante found for me.
- Oh.

Is that Hans Christian Andersen?
Let me guess. Little Mermaid fan.

Hey, Dante.

Hey.

Aw.

- Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
- Yeah. Someone was doing cartwheels.

Okay, we're going to have
to get these fixed before your dad sees.

I can cover for you.

Thanks, but my car is in the shop.

Let me take you.

Does he have to come?

Ouch. What'd I do to her?

Sorry. Yes, that would be great.

Thank you.

Hey. I'll get back to it.

- Hey.
- Mom still hasn't shown up

and she won't answer my calls.

Isn't today the meeting
to finalize her divorce?

Yeah, three hours ago. I mean, she flaked.

Classic Dottie.

Any chance you could watch Henry?

Me, you and our kids,

it's not exactly the quality time
I had in mind today,

but what would the perfect husband do?

Sure. I'll be there soon.

Okay. Thanks.

- Hi.
- I'm sorry to pop by like this,

- but I just heard something terrible.
- What?

My caterer, for the library fundraiser,
got frostbite.

- Too much infrared sauna.
- Oh, my God.

So she's out.
Then I realized, you could fill in.

Oh.

I mean, that's really flattering,

but I haven't catered in a long time.

Don't be silly.
I'm sure it's like riding a Peloton.

I have to develop a menu.

- I'd have to hire people.
- I will handle staff and logistics.

You do the food,

collect the compliments,
get exposure for your business.

Don't make me beg.

- Okay.
- Mm! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Mm...

- What?
- You have a glow about you

and I noticed it on game night too.

Yeah, I mean...

I took your advice.

- About choosing your soul mate.
- Mm.

Joe has been so attentive lately.

I love that. And the sex life?

Back on track, I assume?

No. I don't mean to pry.

No, Joe's just been really busy with work.

No judgment. Have you seen the studies

on how quickly
our sex parts get bored of each other?

But, you know,
it doesn't have to be an issue.

You are so hot, Love.

- Just hack your sex life.
- Like...

with supplements?

A lot of ways to increase Joe's libido.

Tap into his fantasies,
really make him feel like a man.

It's what I've done with Cary,
and my vagina has never been happier.

Look, I'll send you a post
I wrote about it.

Along with an RSVP list of the guests

- with food allergies.
- Okay.

Thanks again.

Whoo!

- Oh, my God.
- Sorry. Sorry. I know, I'm early.

- Yeah. Thank you for meeting me.
- Yeah.

Oh, that's...
That's not why I asked you here.

Okay.

Um...

Sorry, I feel like there's mixed signals,
'cause, like, first, we have sex.

- Can you...?
- It's all right. And then you know...

You say that it can't happen again,

and then you're, like,
stripping at your window,

asking me to meet in secret.

Yeah, you're right.

You're right. I'm a mess.

I guess this is what happens
when your parents get divorced

and you see how easily
your own marriage can fall apart.

- Are you and Joe...?
- Oh, no, no, no.

- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Hey.

You're not alone.

Honestly, like,

we're friends.

I'm your friend, if you need anything.

Okay.

I mean...

- if you really wanna help...
- Mm-hm?

Could you find out
what your dad has on me and Joe?

What...? What do you mean?
What does he have?

- I don't know. That's the thing.
- Okay.

Then... Then why?

I... I mean...

We've talked about this.
My family's in the public eye.

My parents are chopping off
each other's heads in this divorce.

- It shouldn't make my family interesting...
- If it's not like a literal crime,

- he's not gonna show anyone.
- But this is a major trigger for me.

I can't help but worry
when people have information on my family.

- I know it's not rational...
- It doesn't have to be.

I get it. I do.

People are fucking vampires.

You know, that can scar you for sure.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Yeah.

You get it.

Yeah, okay. Yeah, well, you know,
I'll sneak into his office.

See what I can find.

Thank you.

What's your favorite fairy tale?

- Jack and the Beanstalk.
- No.

Yes. Hell, yes. Jack was a little badass.

I wanted to be him. Screw princesses.
I know I wanted to...

How do I make you see
I could be your happily ever after?

Hey, can I say something?
And you don't have to say anything back.

It's been a long time
since I have felt this happy.

This feels so easy.
So I just wanna say thank you.

Can we go back to the library?

Baby, your glasses aren't ready yet.

You wanna play a game?
We can play "I Spy."

Okay.

Uh, I spy with my little eye...

something that begins with the letter M.

- It's Mommy.
- Yeah.

Good job, baby.

You're thinking what I am.
Is this the family we were destined for?

What's wrong?

Um, it's... It's Ryan.

He's giving me a heads-up

that Channel Three is making
a sizable donation to the library

and he will be at the fundraiser
to present the check.

You don't think it's a coincidence?

No, I mean, he's furious
that I'm reopening custody.

It's a power move.

He wants to show me
he can hurt me, even at my job.

Do you think he's watching us?

He feels ownership over me, okay?

Sick as it is. And you stood up to him.

So he's never gonna let that slide.

So this, you and me, we can't.

If Ryan finds out that I was
with a married man, however innocently,

he'll use it and I'll never get custody.

You're right. Ryan is a problem,

but there are always problems
in love stories.

I'll find a way to solve this one,
for you.

One time, I needed a fix so badly

that I broke my molar
with a pair of pliers,

knowing that they'd give me Oxy for it.

That's where this disease took me.

I couldn't wake up without Adderall.
I couldn't go to sleep without Oxy.

Interesting.

Let me tell you what I've learned
about your ex, Ryan Goodwin.

He's not a morning person.

He wears tighty-whities.

He's obsessed with protein shakes
and his workout regimen.

It's like he's training
for the asshole Olympics.

His mom, Harriet Goodwin,

who's also his private chef,
maid and nanny, by the looks of it.

It's not okay, Marienne.

He's gaslit his way to full custody,

when he doesn't even give
your daughter the time of day.

He leaves Juliette to his mom

while he works out with Wes,
his "best friend."

Wes makes Ryan feel superior.
So that tracks.

Ryan is technically sober.
But he's an emotional powder keg.

He's transferred
his addiction to drugs and alcohol

to an addiction to his body and status.

Ryan's sobriety is hanging by a thread.

You put a pebble into the machine
and wait for it to fail.

Fuck. How many shakes does one man need?

Grandma's home.

Where have you...?

- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

Especially after how royally
your father fucked me in the arbitration,

considering that I'm sober as a saint.

One would expect the prenup
to fuck me out of Anavrin,

despite the fact that I created it.

It's the part where he found a way
to get around my lawyer

and take my second-act vineyard,
my second act, for spite.

I'm sorry.

Sorry doesn't even cover it, Love.

I did everything I was supposed to do.

This is what happens
when you marry the wrong man.

- Do you disagree?
- About Dad?

No, he treated you horribly.
That's why I don't speak to him anymore.

Then why are you being so quiet?

I feel...

sad.

I know it's the right thing.
I'm glad that it's over.

But it feels like a...
Like a kind of loss.

You're right and it's sad.

I'm sorry to disappoint you.

That's not what I'm saying.

No, I should have known
the marriage was over two years in

when your father stopped
wanting to do anal.

I don't need the details.

Don't be such a prude.
I'm doing you a service.

You need to know what to look out for

- in your own marriage.
- My marriage is nothing like yours.

So you're not sleeping
with the neighbor's son?

I'm not discussing this with you.

Mom!

It's enough.

Where are you going?

Shit.

I am calling a Lyft.

Excuse me for hoping
my daughter would lend a sympathetic ear.

Knock, knock.

Mm. Leez. Hi. Come on in.
Please. How long has it been?

- Gosh, couple years, right?
- Yeah, couple of years. That's right.

Thanks, Theo. I'm hearing great things
about your work on the corporate side.

The team loves you. You've come
a long way from the cocky, young coder

- who hacked my e-mail.
- My asshole days are far behind me.

Here's the thing. Not too far, I hope.
I need your help with something. Please.

This looks...

like a lot of security camera footage.

Yes. It is. It's every perimeter camera
and doorbell cam in Madre Linda.

Live feeds and cloud archives,
there's all of it.

Not gonna ask how you got it,

but what do you need me for
if you already have access to these?

I need you to help me sort it.

I'm drowning in footage
from a million cameras.

I need the ability to look
at particular people on particular dates.

- You want my facial-recognition algorithm.
- I do.

I had a scary meeting
with the FBI after that one.

No, no, no. They'll never know.

What you want will take a long time.

Oh, I don't think it will,
not if you're involved.

And I'm prepared to dramatically overpay.

Plus, you'd be doing a service
to the world.

How so?

Finding a murderer.

So you're Cary's friend?

Yeah, I'm sorry, how old are you?

I don't need to define myself
by something so arbitrary as a number.

Okay.

Don't worry, this isn't a sting.

So, FYI, I do this as a service,
someone's gonna deal,

so I serve as a means
of medicating the public,

protecting communities
likely to be profiled by the police.

I donate all my proceeds to NAMI.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness.

I'm beginning to think
this generation may just save us all.

That'll be $1,237.37.

I only take Bitcoin.

The lengths I will go to for you,
Marienne...

including sneaking in while Ryan's at work
and Juliette and Grandma are at ballet.

I hope Ryan enjoys his new shake recipe.

Adderall in the morning
and Oxycontin at night

to reintroduce small amounts
into his system.

All in an effort to fire
his neurotransmitters

that are predisposed towards addiction,
thus inciting the phenomenon of craving.

If the combo of cravings
and emotional dysregulation

don't trigger a relapse,

then disrupting his morning routine will.

He'll be off the beam
by your next custody hearing.

And we can thank my son's toys for that
never-ending supply of drained batteries.

I should go but not before I unearth more
about my nemesis.

Does this man own a book not written
by Tim Ferriss or Tony Robbins?

What's this?

It hurts me to leave these here.

He doesn't deserve any part of you,
but it's temporary, Marienne.

I'm gonna fix it for you.

Fix him.

âª Freak like me âª

âª You want a good girl
That does bad things... âª

What happened to my wife?
Am I in trouble?

You look nice.

How was your day?

She smells like The Body Shop.

- It was good.
- Yeah?

Yeah. What's going on?
Planning to cook for an army?

Um...

Sort of?

The caterer for the library fundraiser
dropped out.

So Sherry asked me if I would pitch in.

That's amazing.

You and my wife in the same place.

I've got six people at the bakery

setting up this insane stove situation.
I'm gonna be up all night.

I know your boss is picky,
so I hope I'll make her happy.

I'm sure you will.

I just wanted to make sure
that I made you a nice dinner first.

Okay.

Something is up with her.

Did she kill someone else
and she's trying to distract me?

I have a little less time.

- Okay.
- A little you time, actually.

Oh, no.

This isn't happening.

Shit! I have nothing left.

After you.

- Just maybe not right this second.
- Oh.

- Just maybe not...
- God. I'm sorry.

- I don't know what I was thinking.
- I've had a long day.

- It was a good idea.
- Yeah, of course.

I don't know why I'm trying to blow you
the second you walk in the door,

that's silly.

I did not anticipate this.

Love is unpredictable.
I'm gonna have to fix this.

âª Super duper
We're the party troopers âª

âª We don't need no bad advice... âª

Thank you, shitty batteries.

Fuck.

Thank you, Taschen.

Turns out, playing AmÃ©lie is kind of fun.

Well, you gotta be shitting me.

Considering you just ingested
a megadose of stimulants,

the dragon is unleashed.

No, no, no.

Fuck!

Fuck!

Are you okay? I'm sorry.
I was coming by to update you,

and then I heard screaming, so I entered.

I just burned a bunch of fucking almonds.

I've got, like, 500 other things
I need to do right now. So...

Okay.

So then it's not a good time
to tell you that I couldn't figure out

what my dad has on you and Joe.

Yet, yet.

It's fine.

I will.

Also, while I'm being honest,

it's really hard to stand here
and have a conversation with you,

as though I'm not totally distracted
by how much I want you.

Okay.

All right, let's forget
that I said anything.

Oh.

Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just...

Was it the dad thing
or the hitting on you?

I don't...

I don't know
what the fuck is wrong with me.

Hey.

No, I used to have my shit together.

Hey. Hey, stop it.

Don't be stupid, okay?

Are you sure? Oh, okay.

Oh, fuck.

He called his shithead buddy
to help with the tire.

Hopefully he won't be too helpful.

Brutal, man. Brutal.

Yeah.

And just like that, Ryan Goodwin
takes one small step off the wagon...

Today's already so fucked.
I'm calling in sick so we can get blasted.

- ...and one giant leap toward rock bottom.
- Let's do it.

You're welcome, Marienne.

You like it?

No.

I love it. It's been sold out everywhere.

It was my feeble attempt at an apology
for last night's misfire.

I know that I've been off 'cause of work.
I've been distracted and I'm sorry.

- I should be saying I'm sorry.
- Wait. There's more. Just open it.

Oh, my... Where the fuck
did you get Donut Pal?

It's the magic of my love for you.
No, they opened in Berkeley.

So I paid a kid to stand in line
and courier them over here.

The look on your face
when you bite into one of those...

Doughnuts aren't objectively sexy,

but you make them
the hottest thing on Earth.

Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

I...

I thought
you didn't find me attractive anymore.

Fuck. I've been so single-minded
in my pursuit of you.

Tonight my focus will be on Love.

It has to be,
because if Love is not happy,

we will never get the chance to be.

You know, I...

My mom was just in my head.
Their marriage was so toxic.

Yeah. No, I guess, it's understandable.

But we are not them.

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, this is her.

Um, I should get this.

- You should go get changed.
- Yeah.

Okay.

- Hey, hey, Mom.
- I know I'm late.

I just took a little siesta and forgot
to set an alarm. I'll be there soon.

What are you talking about?

Don't you need me to watch Forty
while you're at the fundraiser?

Oh. No, we got a sitter.
You just take care of you.

So now I'm not good enough
to watch Forty? Is that it?

- Have you been drinking?
- What?

- I need to see Forty.
- You're drunk.

I am not.

You're just mad at me
for bringing up the neighbor boy.

- Okay. I have to go.
- You're keeping my baby from me.

- Don't drive.
- Please let me see Forty.

- I can't deal with you right now.
- He's all I have left.

Little bitch!

Little bitch.

Sweetie, can you help me
set this table up?

No mat.

When the guests arrive,
it'll be packed in here.

That'll keep you
and Love apart, right? Shit.

Love is not stupid. This could be bad.
Why did I agree to this?

Okay. Okay, I need a plan.

I need to keep Love
as preoccupied as possible.

Great. Bye.

Gotta hand it to you, Marienne,
you have outdone yourself.

You think I should just check in on them?

I'm just being neurotic, actually.

Always. But is it too much
to hope she stays back there

- and you two never meet?
- Whatever you think.

There you are.

Undeniably you.

Original, haunting, real,
never mind Alice and the Queen.

You're the red rose herself.

Yeah, I'm just being neurotic.
Thank you so much.

I was looking for you.

- Big problem.
- Yeah.

I forgot to note everyone's
food intolerances on the seating chart.

- Can you...?
- Yeah, of course.

Okay. Um...

You, come!

- We can do this fast.
- Okay.

And just like that,
our fairy tale turns dark.

I should make a disaster
in the kitchen truck,

turn up the oven, scorch the quail,
but it's too late.

It's like I'm watching my own execution.

My man!

- Things work out with Taschen?
- It was great. Yeah. Thank you.

Better than great, actually,
no sign of Ryan means

he's probably in hour eight
of a drug binge with his buddy.

Baby, baby.

I'm sorry, you must be Love. I'm Marienne.

Joe's told me so much about you.

- You're Joe's boss?
- Mm-hm.

- It's so great to meet you.
- You as well.

He's probably told you
how much of a taskmaster I am.

No, I wouldn't say that.

It's true. I do have exacting standards,

which is probably a euphemism
for being a bossy pain in the ass.

No, no, he really...

He really loves working here.

Good.

Even if there's late shifts.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a gem.

He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up and...

I'm, um...

I'm seeing someone.

We're in that "hang out
as much as possible" phase,

so Joe's been picking up my slack.

- Really?
- Yeah.

That's so sweet.
Yeah, no, he doesn't seem to mind at all.

Oh, that's very good to know.

Whatever you're saying
seems to be working for now.

Hey, hey, heads up.
Fifty grand coming through.

What the fuck?
He should be out of his mind.

How is he even standing right now?

Here we go.

- Not a fan?
- He's my ex.

Hello. You both look lovely.
What should I do with this?

Don't want it out
before the big unveiling.

Let me show you.

Excuse us.

Hey, Dante.

That guy is the fucking worst.

Oh, Dante,
one cannot even begin to fathom.

He seems smug, I suppose.
But recovery can't be easy.

Recovery? That prick's never been sober.

His AA stuff is all for show.
There's drugs in his protein shake.

- Like, today?
- Always.

I took a sip on accident once.
I got so tweaked, I couldn't sleep.

And then I realized,
he pounds that stuff all day. Every day.

I have been played.

I couldn't dose Ryan

because he's been dosing himself
the whole time

and his tolerance is through the roof.
How did I miss this?

Dante! How's it hanging, buddy?

So much better now that you're here.
Will you excuse me?

Joe Goldberg, right? I'm Ryan Goodwin.

We met the other night
when I wasn't being my best self.

That's right. It's good to re-meet you.

You fucking cockroach.

Oh! Fuck!

That's meat. Where are you from?

- New York.
- The city?

Brooklyn.

- How's the wine?
- It's okay, I guess.

You know, it's interesting.

I've seen you,
lurking in the back of meetings,

pretending like you're invisible.

But given the way
you're nursing that drink,

you don't strike me as someone
who has a drinking problem.

Fuck, how much of me did he see?

You gotta try this.

It is, like, Iberian or some shit.
Yeah, give it a taste. Come on.

Come on, taste.

What is this?
A sociopath's power play?

I don't know what you're up to,
but I bet my dick, it's about Marienne.

Stay away from her.

Enjoy the party.

I lost this round,
but this isn't over.

Not when you are at stake.

This looks amazing. Unh!

I am so good.

Unh. I knew you'd do me right.

Thanks.

I can't wait any longer. This is torture.

Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

What?

Didn't you read the post I sent you?

Yeah, that really spun me out, Sherry.

The biological importance
of making your man feel like a man?

I...

I just don't think
I'm one of these hot wives.

Oh.

You should've kept reading.

Okay...

Hot Wife is a term...

Right.

...for women in open marriages.

Like me. Cary and I are polyamorous.

Love, please, tell me you got the part
where I sent you a post I wrote.

As in, that's my secret sex blog.

Oh, I do not think
that I picked up on that.

Well, now you know.

And the more time
we spend with you and Joe,

well, we can't stop thinking
about the two of you.

We would love...

to take our relationship to a new level.

Would you be game?

Oh.

Sorry, it's my babysitter.

What the fuck?

- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

Let's hang up on your mother.

We don't need to speak to her.

Thank you.

Stephanie, what a pretty name.

Oh, don't worry, he's not a baby.

No, no, he's the reincarnation
of my son, Forty,

and he loves a good taco.

Don't you, baby? Yes.

My daughter's trying to keep him from me.
She's selfish like her father.

I think we're missing
a couple of "gordatas."

Uh...

- They're coming right out.
- Bless you, Persephone.

- You're a good person, aren't you?
- I guess.

I just want Love to understand
where I'm coming from,

but she refuses to listen.

No one will listen.

Except you.

I'm getting my gordatas.

Chrissake.

No, I need my power back.

I need justice. I need karmic retribution.

- Do you want hot sauce?
- I want all the hot sauce and a lighter.

Excuse me?

I'll give you...

300 dollars for a lighter.

Thank you for listening.

Let's go.

Oh, yeah.

The bastard wanted the vineyard.

Oh, oh!

Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.

Note to self,
if you take a baby on a drunk joyride

to go burn down a vineyard,
make sure you're a rich, white lady

whose lawyer can get you
in a fancy rehab instead of jail.

- Thank you for...
- What the fuck were you thinking?

Just put him to bed, okay? I've got this.

You can sleep here tonight.

Tomorrow, Joe will drive you to rehab.

You'll never see me.

And you will never see Henry ever again.

- You don't mean that.
- I do. With every fiber of my being.

Love, please. I made a mistake.
But I've been punished...

You could have killed him!

You had your family...

and look what you did.

You let your husband destroy
your self-worth.

You neglected your children.
You didn't protect Forty. I did that.

Oh, that's rich.

You liked him broken

- 'cause it gave you purpose.
- Maybe.

But I have a new purpose now
and that's protecting my family.

- From you.
- How can you say that? I'm your mother.

Having no mother would be better.

You think you're so much better than me?
You're just me 20 years ago.

One day, you will lose everything too.

And then you'll see
how cruel you really are.

Oh. Hey.

Did you get it done? Whatever it is.

Yep, just finished up.

So, what were you doing?

He totally passed out.
Think he really needs some rest.

Look, it's none of my business,
but your dad is not okay.

He needs help.

I'll let myself out.

I should be in bed with you,
tracing and drawing on your arm.

Instead, I'm driving an Uber
shuttling Medusa-in-law to rehab.

Bet you're happy
you won't have to see me anymore.

I always thought
we had a good relationship.

I have something to tell you, Joe.

I see how hard you're trying
to make your marriage work, just like me.

I did everything
to keep my family together,

including lying to myself
about who my husband was...

and who my daughter is.

Is this where Dottie tries
to poison me against Love?

Her final act of revenge?

How much do you know
about Love's first husband, James?

Um...

I know they were in love. Married young.

He got cancer and then he died.

Not quite.

When James became ill,
he and Love were already having problems.

After he went into remission,

he asked for a divorce.

And the next thing you know, he was dead.

Surely, she's not suggesting...

I have no proof, of course.
Just a mother's intuition.

You probably think I'm crazy.

I might, if I hadn't seen
what Love is capable of, many times.

This must be hard.

You're loyal.

That's what makes you a good husband.

But Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

If anything were to happen to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

Like a young Gregory Peck.

Could Love have killed her first husband?

I've been so worried about her hurting you
that I failed to remember:

I am also fair game.

But we should be together, Marienne.
I will find a way.

It's risky, but love requires
a hint of madness.

We're all mad here, right, red rose?

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Is everything okay?
- No.

Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

He's threatening to use it against me.

What? We're just colleagues.

We're not. And you know that.

And besides, it doesn't matter

because Ryan will make it look
as bad as possible.

Fucking Ryan. I'll destroy him.

- We can fix this.
- We?

What are you talking about?
You're married.

Your marriage doesn't seem strained.
Your wife is lovely.

Lovely, yes. With a mild habit
of murdering women I care about.

I hated having to lie to her.

I slid into old patterns
and I feel disgusted.

I...

It's not good for my recovery.

I'm at a point where I'm supposed to live
with integrity. I can't be a home-wrecker.

Of course not.

But there has to be another way.

There isn't.

Hey.

I care about you. I do.

And, yeah, there's chemistry.

But...

But, no, I have to think of Juliette.

And I promised myself,
my next relationship would be...

Would be aboveboard and honest.

I'm sorry.

Aboveboard and honest.

How do I give that to you?

You good?

Yeah, yeah, I'm just... I'm tired.

Can I get your opinion on something?

Yeah, of course.

- What do you think about this?
- What is this?

Sherry sent it.
It's from her secret sex blog.

- Sherry and Cary are in an open marriage.
- Hmm.

And... they wanna sleep with us.

Yeah, I thought it was a joke too.

So...? So why are you showing me this?

As a joke, obviously.

Oh.

You don't really look at me the same.

You don't seem interested
in having sex with me.

That's not true.
People go through rough patches.

I don't wanna become...

like my parents.

They couldn't stay in love.

Maybe we need to shake things up.

It sounds crazy, but I read that article.

Opening our marriage.

This loophole cannot be falling
into my lap.

I don't even know how I feel about it.

Sherry just said it was the greatest hack,

and I guess...

Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

I'd rather take
a chain saw to my thigh,

but hopefully, that's negotiable.

Sorry, I'm just being stupid.

Love, Love, stop, stop, stop backpedaling.

You can come to me with anything.

That's what this marriage is, right?

No idea is too crazy?
We talk things through, right?

And we make decisions together.

I love you.

And I love you.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

I need to look at particular people
on particular dates.

I know Theo has a crush on me.
I could pretend like he had a chance.

Love's first husband asked for a divorce.
Next thing you know, he was dead.

Look at you,
making the world more beautiful.

I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I will stay ahead of her this time.

Cary and I are polyamorous.

And we would love to take
our relationship to a new level.

Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

Opening our marriage? This loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

No idea is too crazy.

For you.

Here's the thing, Marienne,

I'm a monogamist.
Some might even say a serial monogamist.

So imagine my surprise when my wife
suggested we read up on polyamory,

aka swinging, aka the lifestyle,

aka a flatlining marriage's dying gasp.

Is it mortifying?

Well...

"Happily ever after is a myth

because people are not static.

Our partners do not owe us a guarantee
that they will never change."

Okay. It's not crazy.

I'm gonna go check on Henry.
I think he'll wake up soon.

I'm leaving out the part where if
your marriage isn't on rock-solid footing,

swinging is all but guaranteed to nuke it,

aka the dream.

Still, after my conversation with Dottie
about the fate of Love's first husband,

I need to tread lightly.

Be game but not too. Make it all her idea.

The Love I first met was a free spirit.

Reality has disappointed her
since we moved to Madre Linda.

I can make it easy to leave me,
no hard feelings, to go follow her bliss.

I learned a new word. "Compersion."

Yeah?

Vicarious joy from seeing your partner
have joyful sexual relations with another.

Hm.

I don't know if this is a good idea.

Shit. Too game.

I'm not sure
we're in a solid enough place.

Okay, back off for a while.

Can I ask you something?

Did you and James ever
do anything like this?

No, he wasn't much of a risk taker.

Plus...

we weren't very far
into our marriage when...

- Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to ask.
- No, it's fine.

James didn't really know what he wanted.

We were planning on having a baby,

and he got cold feet.

And then he got sick,

which was obviously very scary.

But he used it like a shield.

And I wasn't, like,
allowed to be mad. Ever.

I'm so sorry.

That my wife almost definitely
murdered her first husband.

It's fine.

- I probably sound like an asshole.
- No.

Worse.

James let himself become
the villain of their story.

I cannot be the villain of ours.

Listen.

I'm not going anywhere.
Let's not rush this swinging thing.

It just...

It isn't me.

It isn't us.

Which is exactly why we're going to do it.

Hey, Dante. You got a sec?

Hey, yeah. What's up?

Well...

If you don't mind me asking,
you and Lansing,

you guys have been together for how long?

Let's see.

We met when Lansing's boys were 3.
So 13 years.

Stop me if this is too personal.

Have you two always been monogamous?

Are you asking because I'm gay?

Oh, no. No, no, no. I...

I'm fucking with you.

And the answer is, technically, no.

Technically?

We tried a threesome once.

We'd been married a year
and our lives were just work,

kids, eat, sleep, repeat.

- But Lansing wanted to spice things up.
- How'd he convince you?

Didn't have to.

I love him so much.

I thought if this is what he wanted,
I should at least try it.

Just got off the phone with Amy Woodruff.

That name is familiar because...?

She edited every children's book
I'm obsessed with.

- Great.
- Oh, that's cool.

She was calling to congratulate me

on being a finalist
in her imprint's illustration contest...

- Congratulations.
- ...which I did not submit for.

But I seem to recall mentioning to you.

Yeah, yeah. Guilty, I...

I knew you wanted to submit, so...

Dante give us a sec.

Was I not clear?
You're a married man, we are not a thing.

No, we're friends. That's it.
But you missed the deadline

- for the last submission.
- I did.

Knowing how much
you beat yourself up over that, I just...

Decided to do it for me?

I decided to help
because I knew you would win.

The world should see your work.

They're my deadlines to miss.

Yeah, message received.

You're right. Listen, I'm not the type
of guy to go around sticking my nose in,

so I'm sorry.

Good.

- Can I go back to being excited now?
- Please.

Um, I've gotta...

- Fuck. Of course.
- Yep.

Great. It's Madre Linda's
most respected drug fiend.

Your custody hearing is approaching
and suddenly I'm seeing a lot more of him.

- Hi, Ryan.
- Well, you're in a good mood.

Yeah, it's, um, been nice having Juliette.

Smart to keep good news from him.

- So you ready for that thing on Friday?
- That thing?

Where you convince a judge that you're
not using our daughter to punish me?

I would've rather worked things out
like adults.

I thought that's what we were doing.

Juliette, time to go.

- Already?
- Don't argue.

Let me help you, baby.

This is hard on your daughter.

I wish I could fix it.
I wanna fix everything for you.

- Did you have fun? All right.
- Mm-hm.

Henry's down for the night.

Hey.

Come to bed.

Mm. Trying to reignite the spark,

and my move here is make it not so easy.

Sorry.

Long day.

Okay.

- How are we gonna get back to us?
- Love, I'm just tired.

Yeah. Or bored.

So far, so good.

- No, I'm... No, I...
- Maybe that's...

just what marriage does.

You know, I love us.

It's... But it's... It's known.
You know, I want a secret.

I wanna still be fun.

- You are fun.
- No, I mean, like, wild.

Like, you remember
those first few months we...

- You know?
- Yeah.

And now that's just over?

Because I'm a mom and a wife,

I can't be...?

Be honest.

Don't Sherry and Cary seem
more interesting

now that we know they swing?

- I thought you didn't want to.
- I don't know what I want.

I got married so young.

There's a lot of things
I never got to try.

Well, the last thing I wanna do is stand
between you and anything you want.

I have to guide her. Gently.

Do you have any fantasies?

Like, did you ever experiment?

Okay, I made out drunkenly
with my college roommate, you know...

- Total clichÃ©.
- Total.

See. Boring.

No, I'm kidding.
I haven't done any experimenting either.

- So you've never had a threesome?
- No.

Unless you count under the bed
with Peach Salinger and her drug dealer.

You ever kiss a guy?

Would you?

Under the right circumstances,
I don't see why not.

Wow. Yeah, this is just fun
to talk about.

Time to move to the next step.

In all honesty, reading books is great.
But it does somehow feel clinical.

We could talk to the experts.

Bull's-eye.

I'm sure Sherry and Cary would be happy
to give us a walk-through.

I know you're not Sherry's biggest fan.

I'd rather fuck a cactus.

We're talking strictly physical, right?

It would be with Cary.
Also strictly physical.

Yeah, I'm not threatened by Cary
in the slightest.

- We would just be asking them questions.
- Yeah, we're not committing to anything.

The nondisclosure is mandatory.

It's standard practice in a community
as tight-knit as ours.

So do you do a lot of these?

Can't confirm or deny but, I mean,

everyone in Madre Linda has tried
the lifestyle at some point.

Huh. The burbs are even more
miserable than I thought.

Um... I, um...

Aw, damn you.

Oh, yeah, those look worth fucking
my glycemic variability for.

Okay. Well...

- Mm.
- Here you go.

So, when you started the lifestyle,
were you two already in a good place?

Not as good as we are now.

Our marriage grew rock solid
through these little trust falls.

We can take you through a Q and A.

You know, no "presh,"
you'll see, the whole thing, it's very...

You're in control.

Great. Okay.

So let's just get started.
Obviously, STIs we should know about?

- No.
- Good.

Love, let's talk menstruation.

Um, I'm not due for another three weeks.

Cycle twins.

And our kids are at camp through August.

Okay, well, we...

We have a great babysitter.

Henry could stay
the night there if, you know...

Suddenly this feels real.
They really are pros.

Well, let's get to the fun stuff.
What are you comfy with?

Joe, start with an easy one.

Are you good
with Love and I getting physical?

Yeah.

Girl-on-girl, usually a given.

Love and Cary.

I couldn't care less
but can't appear too game.

I mean...

I trust you.

Love, are you good
with Joe and Cary fooling around?

Sure.

But... Are you...?

For the public,
the brand is conventional monogamy.

Some don't understand that
a bisexual man is a truly optimized man.

Okay, I can keep an open mind.

For you, Marienne,
I will walk through fire.

- What about Joe and me?
- Seeing as Love killed

- the last woman I almost slept with...
- That's a no.

- It's fine by me. What do you mean?
- I...

- Do you not want to?
- No, no, no. I thought...

Why?

- Because...
- Okay. Moving too fast.

- Yeah.
- Oh, what's happening?

We've been doing this a while,

and we can tell
when a foundation's a little shaky.

No shame, it's just you two are so...

young.

Hit us up if you get on the same page.

- What the fuck just happened?
- A major setback.

Miss Bellamy.

Let's talk about your day-to-day routine
with visitation.

Who prepares your child's meals?

When Juliette's with me, I do.
When she's with Ryan, his mother does.

'Cause Juliette loves the taste
of unseasoned chicken.

Even when you're practicing
for court, you're still delightful.

Excellent. Don't say that last part.

How would you describe
your recovery from addiction?

- Well, I have my weekly meetings...
- Nope. In the four years since.

- Give me a second.
- She's doing really well.

She needs to be perfect.

I stand before you
with an Ivy League education

and two successful stepsons.

We have been trying to adopt
for three years.

There's always a snag.

I'm being hard on you

- because I know what you're up against.
- I know. I'm trying, I just...

The fucker is plotting something,
and I can feel it.

We'll get there. Keep practicing.

Thank you, Dante.

And I gotta go give Charlie
his lunch break.

- Can I actually talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

So I know it's a lot to ask,

but it would mean so much to me
if you would be a character witness

at my hearing?

Of course. You're an incredible asset
to the library.

Cool. Great. Thanks.

But I actually need you to play up
the whole kick-ass mom thing.

I will character witness
the motherly living shit out of you.

Thank you.

Um...

Yeah, thank you. Uh...

That was hope.

The least I can do...

is hasten the end of my marriage.

Speak of the devil.

I guess we're having fun now.

The swinging book say to test your comfort
by role-playing little scenarios.

Okay, here we go.

The fuck?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's my bad.

You know, it's... It's not the most subtle
come-here of my life,

but I'm really...
I'm not complaining about it.

I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't even see you there.

Role-playing gets complicated fast,
evidently.

I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't mean to throw this over here.

Um...

I saw Joe's car in the driveway.

Yeah.

He's taking a nap.

I know...
I know I should be chill but, like...

Theo.

Oh.

You know, actually, Joe...
That's Joe. He's awake.

And he's watching us.

Well, then we better behave.

Right.

Wait, um, the...

Your dad. The office?

Yeah, I don't know. It's like...
It's impossible.

Okay.

But I'll figure it out.

I will.

Okay.

You're the best.

Fucking creep show.

Theo's still circling Matthew,
but he'll get there.

I gathered.

Did you?

Yeah.

How did that make you feel?

Jealous?

A large amount of nothing. However...

Possessive.

Yeah?

My wife needs to feel
like mildly transgressing

with that idiot rich kid did the trick.

She's not a boring, tired suburban mom.

She's fun. Wild.

Still the Love Quinn who flirts
with strangers in the produce section.

Which is why I'm going to satisfy her
as only someone who knows her can.

Safe. Reliable.

We can do anything together.

Satisfied but still hungry.

I love you so much.

That felt safe?

So safe.

Solid.

Do you think we're solid?
I think we're solid.

- I mean, if you think we are...
- Yeah.

You'll call the sitter? I'll text Sherry.

- Okay.
- Okay.

- Theo. What happened?
- The Wi-Fi went out.

- What?
- The Wi-Fi went out.

Okay, it's probably a brownout.
Just give it a minute.

Do you think it has to do with the dozens
of servers you snuck into your office?

Are you sleeping okay?
Are you getting enough to eat?

Me? Yeah, I'm good.

- Okay. Good.
- You?

Uh... No. I'm... Yeah, obviously, I'm...

A bit of a rabbit hole. I know.

But if there's something...
If you wanna talk about...

Yeah, can we talk about how, like,
people aren't built to live in an office?

Without, like, taking a walk or something,
so their brain can air out.

Right.

Do you wanna walk
to Pobrecito's right now?

We could get some tacos.
We could hang out.

Yeah, I know. I...

Yeah, I'd love that. Um...

I gotta send this thing tonight though.

It's like... It's a letter to the dean

asking if I can drop in
on the classes that I'm missing.

- Really? That's great.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

I mean, I really... I am hungry.

Well, no, no, that's great.

I'll bring you something back.
What do you want? Al pastor?

Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, Dad.

Sure.

Okay, okay, okay.

What the fuck?

It's scary, isn't it?

What is this?

You planted cameras, like...
Like, all over town?

No, no, no. They were there.
I'm just accessing them.

Accessing. But...

You realize
that this is domestic abuse, right?

That you so casually access.

I wouldn't be looking at Love
if she weren't connected to Natalie.

Or you.

What's that supposed to mean?

You tell me.

What is it you think
you're doing with Love Quinn?

- You spied on me?
- I didn't spy on you.

- What? You're accusing Love of murder?
- No.

I don't have proof yet.

But either way, she's a married woman
with a baby living next door,

not to mention a husband hiding
some anger management problem.

- What do you care?
- I care when you do stupid shit.

Oh, that's ironic

since I've been at your door,
trying to get you to eat or sleep.

And you've been fucking buried in here,
obsessed, strung out

- like some fucking QAnon nutjob.
- You're acting like a stupid fucking brat!

Just move on, okay?
She's dead! She's dead!

None of this is gonna bring her back.

Get out.

- What?
- You heard me. Pack your shit.

You're going back to your mom's tomorrow.

Get the fuck out now!

- Hey.
- Hello.

Cary's getting the rest of the things
from the car.

I'm afraid to ask, what things?

Wow, Sherry you look amazing.

I'm doing this for you.
I'm doing this for you.

Well, thanks again for hosting.
This remodel will be my death.

Elon's decorator is brilliant,
but he's so slow.

It's our pleasure.

There's... I made oysters.

Aphrodisiacs. Well played.

Ha, ha!

- Joe, Joe, Joe.
- Are they moving in?

Bring it in.

Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

- Is that Bleu de Chanel?
- No, Cary. It's soap.

Love buys that stuff for me. So I...

A man that doesn't wanna
share his scent. Respect.

I'm sorry, what is this music?

- We'll need to change it stat.
- Babe, I'm all over it.

- You do primary setup.
- Primary?

And your bedroom is...?

- It's upstairs.
- But first...

To a night we won't forget.

To a blame-free exit from this marriage.

I'd like to get this over with,
but how do we get it started?

Okay, let's loosen up a bit, shall we?

I'll start.

Disclosure, I can get quite vocal
in the bedroom.

Don't let it alarm you.

She is a screamer, this one, okay?
I mean, get ready.

Love.

All right, everybody up.

Okay.

Okay. Up, up, up. All right.
Now, shake it out.

Oh, yeah. Full go.

Total liberation.

- I can feel it.
- Get in your hips.

Yes, you, let's do it over here.

- Go.
- Okay.

Okay,

- let's hit this from a spiritual angle.
- This is where they drop the act

- and ask us to join their cult.
- Look each other in the eyes.

She's scared. This isn't her,
but she desperately wants it to be.

Now, if you ever get overwhelmed,
just look at your partner. Connect.

At the end of the day,
that's who you're here for.

And if you feel too overwhelmed,
just use the safe word:

Hakuna matata.

Disney should sue these people.

Okay. No more talk. Let's dance.

Love?

Hey, you.

There's the Love I remember, free, open.

âª I don't need to feel the sun
Let me touch your skin âª

I couldn't be happier for...
Oh, there it is. Compersion.

âª Fill my mind with dirtiness
I'll invade your dreams âª

Come on. I wanna show you
what I set up in the bedroom.

And I'm officially terrified.

I did say I'd endure torture for you.

All right. Just remember,
tonight is a marathon, it is not a sprint.

We have to have each other's backs.

I got you covered.

My magic potions.

Stimulants, lab-grade shrooms,

liquid downregulation,

killer rest-and-recovery aid
but strong as dick.

I KO'd myself, like, six times
before getting my dosage right.

Yes.

This boosts testosterone like a mofo.

Okay.

For you.

Actually, I probably need it tonight.

Okay. Down the hatch.

Thattaboy.

Now...

allow me to introduce you to my ritual

for a night like tonight.

Oh, ho-ho-ho.

Oh, Marienne.

You are the only one who could make
whatever's about to happen worthwhile.

It's okay, you can look at it.

Look at my dick.

Welcome to the real party, brother.

So glad you're here.

What the fuck is happening?

If you don't wanna fuck yourself,

how is someone else gonna
wanna fuck you, my man?

Oh, of course. Cary is Cary-sexual.

Well, don't just stare.
Grab a mirror, join in.

My savior.

Cary, you know what?
This is our babysitter.

- Real quick. Real quick, real quick.
- Hey, we said no... phones.

Hey.

- Is everything okay?
- I'm sorry.

I didn't know who else to call
'cause I have no friends because of him.

Ryan?

An anonymous e-mail went out
to all of my contacts.

I know it was him
because there were photos,

- explicit photos that only he has and...
- Oh, no. I know those photos.

And one of the people he sent it to
is Amy Woodruff, the editor,

the children's book editor.

And... And...

Now she'll never work with me.

He is truly evil.

I'm so sorry.

I knew he was up to something.

He fucking gets off on this shit.

The worst part about being married is
that they actually know you so well

that they can just use it
for the rest of your life.

Listen to me, those photos,

I know, sane people know,
Ryan weaponized them,

and that makes him the bad guy
and a disgusting excuse for a human being.

How am I supposed
to look at him in court tomorrow?

With pity. He's a piece of shit
and you're gonna win.

The rest...

we'll figure out, okay?

I'll help you,

if and only if you ask me to, of course.

Um...

Do you wanna come over?

I just...

I could really use a friend.

I'd give anything to.

Joe, where the fuck are you, brother?

I wish I could, but...

No, no, no. It's okay.

No, you've actually... You've done enough.

Thanks for answering, Goldberg.

You missed the finale in there.
Give it to me.

This will go in the phone bowl downstairs
with everybody else's.

Well, it's go time.

Oh, welcome back.

I missed you.

Someone's loose.

- Are you okay? You still seem tense.
- You think?

- I'm good. No, I'm good.
- He's just a little shy.

Oh, okay, so this is really happening.

Uh... Mm. Ow.

Watch.

Is there something wrong?

Are you okay with this?

More than okay.

I'm embarrassed for us.

Ooh.

This is fine. This is great, even.

Sorry to ask twice,
but is there something wrong?

Hey, sweetie,
just wait for the pill to kick in.

Oh, yeah.

I'm not used to an audience, I think.

Oh, I get it. I get it.
Just remember, look at your partner.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, go.

But I don't want Love,
I don't want Sherry.

I don't want any of this.
All I want is you.

There you are.

There you are.

I knew you'd come.

Big boy.

Yes.

Hakuna matata!

- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fuck!

- Fuck. Somehow I just became the bad guy.
- No, it's okay. It's all right.

Shit.

I cannot let her blame me
for this shit show.

Hey.

What happened?

Who is she?

Excuse me?

Who were you thinking about just then?

Nobody. Just you. It's always you.

Bullshit.

I know you, Joe.

I know what I do will never
be good enough for you.

This was your idea.

Well, I had to do something.

Or what?

Why do you act like I'm not all in?
I am right here.

All I do is worry about you.

I don't need you to worry about me.

I need your heart.

- Henry needs your heart.
- Leave Henry out of this.

I can't, Joe.

Unlike you, I have to be his mother 24/7.

In addition to running a fucking business,

keeping this house together,
dragging you to therapy,

trying to be my sexiest self so you don't
get bored and find another Natalie.

- Can you please lower your voice?
- Why? You hate hearing the truth?

- Our marriage is completely one-sided.
- That is absurd.

You made me kill her.

In addition
to being mother of the fucking year,

I had to run interference
on one of your fucking patterns!

- I killed Natalie for you!
- Shut...

up.

Was that...?

Fuck me.

Maybe they didn't hear anything.

We have to know for sure.

Okay, well,

Sherry has this tell when she's lying,
she scratches her arm.

I'll follow your lead.

Okay.

- There you are.
- Hey.

Take any longer,
I'd have to shuck the corn again.

I'm so sorry, guys. I just got in my head.

I'm good now.

I hope I didn't kill the vibe.

Oh, my God, of course not.

- It's so easy to get overwhelmed.
- Yeah.

Yeah.

Now...

where were we?

I just can't tell.

Something wrong?

Oh, I'm great.
Why don't we get on the bed?

Go.

Hey, Sherry.

I don't know what you think you heard...

But we're...

There you go.
It's gonna end badly for Love too.

Sherry knows Krav Maga.

Go to sleep, buddy.

Let me go!

No! No, please! No! God!

That does not sound good.

He could be at Matthew's by now.

Guess I'm gonna use Cary's gift
from the hunting trip after all.

Cary, let's go back inside.
We can talk about this.

This is it. I never see you again.

I get impaled, Love goes to prison.

Henry grows up in the system.

No.

Are you okay?

Holy fucking shit.

I think that was the best sex
we've ever had.

Yes, it was.

The spark our marriage needed
doesn't come from swinging.

Our love language is violence.

Shit.

- Hey.
- What happened to the car?

Love spilled fruit sauce.
So I'm just getting it before it sets in.

At 5 a.m.?

Couldn't sleep.

Doesn't look like he's gotten much either.

You okay?

What was that last night?

Last night? Oh, we were...
I mean, were we that loud?

We had a kid with a sitter,
had a little fun.

With the Conrads? I saw their car.

Yeah, they were here for a second. Yeah.

Oh.

I thought I heard someone scream.

It was drunken shenanigans.
It was harmless, really. I'm embarrassed.

Stupid fun, really.

Yeah, you and your wife, Love.
Just having fun.

Yeah, again,
I apologize if it disturbed you.

We were saying we should have you over
for dinner sometime soon.

Yeah, real busy with work. But sometime.

Sometime.

I put my best friend...

in a cage.

Oh, my God.

I am so grateful for you.

I don't know anybody else
who would understand.

I don't know what I'd do without you.

Okay.

I'm gonna make breakfast

and then I can contact Henry's sitter
to see if they'll take him longer.

We can just clean up.

We'll go over there.
We'll "good cop, bad cop" them.

She's too good at this now.
This should not be routine.

We will get through this, okay?

I don't want to, I want you...
Shit. Your custody hearing.

Joe?

I forgot, I promised to fill in for Dante.
He's got a thing and I have to...

I'll be fast, meet you soon as I'm done.
Don't do anything until I get there.

- You are, as ever, an inspiration.
- Thank you.

Well, that happened.

- You killed it.
- You were so great.

- Yeah?
- Yeah. Flawless, unimpeachable.

Dare I say, unironically,
mother of the year.

I'm so glad you were here. Both of you.

Thank you.

What was that?

Are Ryan and the judge friends?

You were right. The system is rigged.

Come on, Dante. We're gonna go.

And as long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

Hey. You good?

Yeah, I'm okay. What about...?

Oh, they're... They're just waking up.

Hey.

We're a team, okay?

Till death do us part.

Clearly, my plan has backfired.
My wife seems more into me than ever.

Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

Cary and Sherry
wanna sleep with us.

Opening our marriage, this loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

You've been fucking buried in here.
Obsessed.

Just move on, okay? She's dead!

Get the fuck out now!

Just remember. Look at your partner.

But I don't want Love.
I don't want any of this.

All I want is you.

- I killed Natalie for you!
- Shut up!

Go.

Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

You wanna give me a report?

I'm good, I'm good. Thanks, babe.

Okay, baby. Um...

I'm gonna have to move us
to a purple flag.

You're holding back.

Recognized.

I was in pain 'cause you got
some tape on my wound.

I didn't want it
to sound like I was blaming you.

Oh, my God. Baby, I appreciate
your concern for my feelings.

I'm moving us back to a green flag.

Stay in purple flag for a sec.

Yeah?

Try that bandage again
because it hurts like a motherfucker.

Yes, yeah, just brace yourself.

Breathe, sweetie. Take a deep breath in.

I have some fucking weirdos
in the basement.

Yet, in their own weirdo way,

the Conrads bring out
the best in each other.

Now, Love and me,
we bring out something in each other.

That's why I need to get out.

In Love's mind,
we're finally on the same page

and can face adversity as a united front,
which means Love's taken it upon herself

to figure out how to, quote,
"get rid of the Conrads."

And I am tasked with restoring our home
to a state of Rockwell perfection.

Rockwell by way of Bettie Page, anyway.

All while trying to keep
my son's attention on his cartoon.

Don't worry.

After today, we're never doing this again.

Unread still.
Where are you, Marienne?

I need you to remind me
there's life beyond this.

What's wrong?

You throw your pacifier? Where is it?

R.I.P. pacifier.

And I have to figure out how to trash
Sherry and Cary's smorgasbord of sex toys.

Make it like this disaster of a night
never happened.

This stuff I should keep.

Could prove useful.

Unlike their lifetime supply
of double-headed dildos,

those I've seen enough of.

What the actual fuck?

So last night could have gone worse?

Fuck, this is a Chekhov situation now,
isn't it?

If I touch it,
I all but guarantee it gets fired.

Does that apply in real life?

There's a literary trope
that pops up as often as Chekhov's gun,

where you leave it
and then someone else uses it against you.

Of the two...

Chekhov was a logical man, he'd agree.

At least Henry can't comprehend
what's happening.

I'm trying to protect him, Marienne.

The way no one bothered to protect us.

- Check this out.
- Ooh!

Nurse Fiona?

Morning.

Morning, Joseph.

Are you okay?

Go hang out with your friends.

Who pissed in her Wheaties?

That guy she's dating hurts her.

What are you gonna do about it?
Gonna beat him up?

Come on, man. Didn't you learn
from last time with your mom?

- Dante, what's up?
- Have you seen Marienne?

I'm having trouble reaching her.

She didn't come into work?

I'm worried she got bad news
about the custody hearing.

- Shit.
- I hope not.

But, if so,

I might know where she went.

Tell me where. I can go.

Okay, there's this store.

When she was feeling really bad,
she used to sit outside

and entertain going in.

She hasn't done it in a while.

- A liquor store?
- If she's there,

she's not gonna wanna talk to you.

I should have been with you,
not in Love's latest mess.

I shouldn't have left you alone.

Hey, Dante, can you watch Henry
for just a little bit?

Oh, my God. Yes.

- Bring the little prince here.
- Thank you. I'll be there soon.

Love thinks I'm getting rid of evidence.
Ought to buy me some time.

I'm coming, Marienne.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

These look amazing.

Thank you.

What's up with him?

Mm, stomach problems, stress.

But honestly, I think these will help.

Cary?

Thank you, Love.

You're both acting fucking weird.

I mean...

can you blame us?

And what about you? You...

Holding up all right?

Me?

Yeah.

I'm sure you'd rather spend
every spare minute on your letter.

For Henry's school counselor?

Fuck, that was due today.

I did say I'd help.
If you're comfortable with it.

It's super vital to have her on your side
if you wanna get into Ashman.

I'm not gonna let you write a letter
to help get my son into preschool.

No!

Love, see,
you're getting it wrong already.

It's not the admission letter.

It's a letter of introduction

for the counselor who's gonna get
your son into preschool.

Hey, truth?

One mother to another.

In no universe would I ever jeopardize
that baby's future.

And trust me,
you only get one shot at Ashman.

So Matthew has video of Joe and me?

I always thought
your husband was an abusive dick but...

now, thanks to my dad, there's proof.

So this is what he's been doing?
Recording people?

He's trying to figure out
who killed Natalie.

Does he think it was me?

What? No. No, of course not.

I mean, I don't know. I don't know.

Who knows what he thinks?
He's not on his A-game.

He's not recording people.

He's just... He's accessing all the footage

from all the cameras
everyone's already got.

- What the fuck?
- Okay, okay, look.

He kicked me out.

Theo...

I'm not going back to my fucking mom's.

I just...

I'm gonna go do my own thing.

You know, go have a life, and, um...

I want you to come with me.

Run away with me, Love.

I care about you, like so...

I love you.

I can't stand it.

Just look me in the eye...

and tell me
that your husband is not a violent man.

Okay.

This is what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna go,

I'm gonna go back to my dad's
and get that footage.

It's gonna be hard proof
that Joe is a piece of shit.

I know that it's not admissible

and I know it would get my dad
in a lot of trouble,

but I am saying threaten Joe with it.

You can use it to make a clean break.

I know.

I know, it's a lot.

I need to think.

I'm gonna take care of you.

I promise.

Okay?

He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

I'll be back.

Okay.

Fuck you, Dad.

This is so far beneath you.

I wanna erase everything that ever
made you think you deserve to be here.

Um, what are you doing here?

Oh, shit. My book club meets here.

- What are you...?
- Dante.

We were worried.

- What happened?
- Please don't talk to me

in that tone of voice like I'm about
to jump off a goddamn building.

Have you?

Sometimes I just like to sit
and count the creases in the paper bag.

You're embarrassed.
You don't want me to see you like this.

Did the judge rule against you?

Are you surprised?

Ryan's taking her away from me.

- You can fight it...
- They're moving to New Jersey.

He's got a new job lined up,
a huge opportunity,

cable news and...

could it be any more perfect than that?

Son of a bitch.

I was so stupid
to take this back to court.

- I got greedy.
- You deserve everything you want.

And more.

Yeah.

You can tell Dante I'm fine.

Look.

Fine.

You can go.

I get it.

There are times I hate myself... too.

So much I can barely stand it.

I killed someone.

When I was little.

He was hurting my mom, so I shot him.

That's how I ended up in a home.

So you aren't the only person

who's haunted by shame.

Joe.

Do you think now that I deserve
all the bad things that happened to me?

No, of course not.

- You were a kid.
- My mom felt differently.

Yeah, well, fuck her.

She was your mom. I would never...

Exactly.

You would never.

That is the kind of mother you are.

I struggle...

every day with the fact that I'm capable
of doing something like that.

I hate that I did it, but I did it.

And I have to figure out
how I'm gonna live with it.

And Henry makes it worth it.

- Yes.
- Mm.

- Yes, and I did not see that coming.
- Mm-hm.

Yeah, neither did I.

I just want her back.

You're gonna figure that out.

That's what people like us do.

I don't need to cause any more damage.

You can't.

I'm serious. No matter
how broken my marriage is,

it has nothing to do with you.

It's done.

I'm ending it.

I would do anything for you.

It's just, ask. Just ask me.

What am I supposed to do now?

What do you want?

This.

This is real.

I don't have to pretend with you.

I'm the real me. This is our beginning.

I'll find a way to fix everything,
so that this is our every day.

Cary, you're off-key.

You're not gonna get
the parasympathetic response.

I'm not looking to reduce heart rate.

I'm seeking a state of readiness.

What?

You're gonna break us out of here?

I'm sensing a little bit of a tone.

Well, I'm in a cage and you're planking.

Do you have a plan?

Yes, use everything
that's at our disposal.

- My brute strength...
- Our relationships.

Your friendship with Love?

If you two were friends,

why didn't she tell you about
the dungeon in her basement?

- Hi, Love.
- Hey.

Okay, you could have asked.

Since you're in my phone,

I send my twins a check-in e-mail
every day that they're at camp.

Yeah, sure. I'll send one.

Thank you so much.

So, um...
why did you wanna get into my phone?

Just thought
I should make sure you check in

with your adoring masses.

You're gonna be off the grid
learning how to make placenta tea,

so no posts for a while.

God, you're so smart, Love.

- Even under stress and...
- Stop trying to be my friend.

We are friends.

Were, are... I'm sorry.
I don't know how to talk to you

- in this situation.
- Then why are you talking to me?

Because my life is at stake.

And, also, I happen to care about you
and apparently that didn't go away.

Kind of always knew you had secrets.

I just thought
I knew why you were so hush-hush.

Because Madre Linda is a nest
full of narcissistic vipers?

I mean, yeah, of course.

'Cause narcissism is control.

Do you know how terrifying it is
to not feel like you're in control?

Especially with a kid.

And... who isn't trying
to control us, Love?

We're two women who are smarter
than everyone else

and people can't stand that.

I mean, my influencer bullshit means
I get to choose my flaws.

What gets criticized, when they even see.

It's how I protect myself and my family.

Look where that got you.

Yeah.

I guess one could argue,

I was in a cage of my own making
the moment I had kids.

No, got married.

And at some point,
it all feels like the game is rigged.

This was all and... Hilariously inevitable.

Theo tried to convince me
to run away with him.

You're shitting me!

He's totally in love with you,
and I knew it.

I mean, it's, like, super gross
but I think that's kind of hot.

- Ew.
- Shh.

He also told me that Matthew

has been stealing surveillance footage,
hoping to find out who killed Natalie.

He won't find anything.

You should out him.

- What?
- What do you mean?

On my blog. Yeah, you should say
that we found out that Matthew

has been watching us. He's a creep.

Out him.

Just my opinion.

I thought I knew what love was.

Beck was a child.

And Love? She fooled me into believing
she was someone she wasn't.

The only thing I'm thankful for,
she brought our son into the world

and led me to you.

It's you, Marienne.

Oh, no.

Joe, Theo got information.

Just call me back as soon as you get this.

I left her to her own devices
for too long.

God knows what she...
The Conrads are probably dead.

Maybe she burned their house down,
then bashed Matthew over the head.

Goddamn it, Love.

Who's that, Joe?

Joe...

Thank you.

You were right.
I can't just give up on Juliette again.

I can't let her feel
that her mother could ever abandon her.

So I'm leaving Madre Linda.

You're leaving?

Follow them to New Jersey,
even if it means sleeping in my car,

flipping burgers, whatever it takes.

I'm going to lose you.

I don't regret this.

Good, good.

But how can I stop this
from being the end for us?

Go home, Joe.

Can I at least get my clothes back?

I guess that seems fair.

This wasn't the plan,
but I can't blame you.

You're trying to solve
an impossible problem,

and that problem is Ryan.

Why don't you just sleep
in your office? I don't care.

Travis!

What did you do?

Chekhov, you fucker. I can't, right?

That's the guy Love wants me to be.

Then again, people like us,
we figure it out.

Ryan has to die.

Is that our doorbell cam?

Yeah, ripped it out. Where's Henry?

He's with Dante. I wasn't clear
on when our guests are checking out.

Yeah, I've been preoccupied.

So, turns out,
our friendly neighbor has been hacking

into everyone's security cameras
for months.

- Shit.
- Yeah.

He thinks
his wife's killer is still out there.

Oh, does he?

Yeah, but thank God
for Sherry Conrad who found out

and took it upon herself
to blog about it a half hour ago.

It must be said, Love's good at all this.

Say more, please.

It seems like she found out
what he was doing,

so she and Cary fled
to some undisclosed location.

Whole town's in an uproar.

Scary good.

Which explains a whole slew of suits
that just descended on the Engler house.

My best guess, it's a bunch
of lawyers scrambling to cover up

all the insanely illegal shit
he's been doing.

Wow.

You really have been busy.

Yeah. Well, as were you, it seems.

Shit. The other shoe drops.

The house looks amazing.

Good as new, right?

Quite the team, aren't we?

In the worst way.

Fuck.

- What...? What is this?
- Anton cackling in his grave.

I found that in Cary's stuff.

- Cary?
- Yeah.

That psycho brought a gun into our house?

These people are more fucked up
than I thought.

Um, okay.

Perfect. We could make it look
like a murder-suicide.

Worked for us before.

Listen to her. Our marriage
cannot end soon enough.

Great minds...

Okay.

You want me to wipe it? I hear you.

You're not hearing me
because I'm not saying that.

We need to be clear.

You're erasing everything you've gathered
of your own volition and entirely alone.

And throwing the whole thing away

because, damn it,
I just felt like an upgrade. Got it.

Hey, I'm sorry,
I was just coming to look for my charger.

If I could just get
a little more time here, please.

Show me the thing that's haunting you.

If there's more,
I will do everything I can to help.

I don't trust my neighbors.

- Joe seems okay, but the wife, Love.
- The Quinn, of course.

Yes, Love saw Natalie
the day she disappeared, and she is off.

Okay. Okay, let's see it.

Nat arrives, then she goes in...

Then drives away. What am I missing?

She stayed in there for a while,
then she comes out.

There's a second missing,

and she's wearing
that coat and hat, and...

Keep going.
Do you think that's not Natalie?

I know how it sounds.

Okay, it's not her.
It's the Quinn who killed her,

broke her ring to destroy the bio-data,
staged it at a rest stop,

dropped off her car,
and killed Gil Brigham too,

of all people.

Made it look like a suicide
to frame him for murder.

- I am trying...
- I know what it sounds like.

Or Natalie was a beautiful,
flawed person with secrets.

Part of her wasn't
who you thought she was.

I don't fucking believe that, okay?
I can't fucking believe that.

I just keep thinking.
If I look harder, I'm gonna see it.

Okay, you have combed
through this thoroughly. Am I wrong?

You have to decide if you're gonna
let this hunch destroy you,

your company, this family.

These people are coming for you.
It needs to be gone.

You did the right thing.

So... I haven't seen Joe much.

Can you...?

I'll get him a new one.

Yeah.

God. You know, it doesn't seem fair.

This all. I mean, Joe's the reason
we're all in this position

in the first place.

You didn't do what you did to Natalie

because the Englers were stealing
your Wi-Fi.

You were trying to tell me
how disconnected you felt.

Of course.

Your husband's
screwing someone else while you're what,

changing diapers?

Sherry, shut the fuck up.

Where is he now?

Fuck him. Letting you fix a marriage that
never stood a chance in the first place.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- Easy, hon!
- Is that my nine?

Just sit and be quiet.

New rules. One of you takes this,
shoots the other.

I let whoever lives out.

- Are you insane?
- Wait, what?

Well, if your marriage is so perfect,
stay together, die together.

This is the part of myself
I told you I struggle against.

It took bros in the woods to teach me
it's not something I need to reject.

It can be embraced for the right reasons.

- Thank you.
- Thanks.

He looks like a man riding high
on a string of recent victories.

Big new job, full custody of his kid.

Thanks to Cary Conrad's
black-market elephant tranquilizer,

Ryan's tox report will tell the story,
a guy trying to outrun the demons.

Sadly, the demons won.

I know from my recon
that Ryan is the kind of nutjob

who thinks taking the stairs
will add years to his life.

Well, the irony.

Wait, where's he going?

The elevator, you lazy piece of shit.

You following me, asshole? Huh?

Fuck.

You gotta be kidding me.
My ex put you up to this, Library Joe?

- No, that was me.
- No? All right.

- Speak up. I can't hear you.
- I just want to talk.

Talk, really? Talk.

With this?

New trope: wishing you had Chekhov's gun to fire.

I think I'll call the cops.

Great. I'll tell them
about the drugs in your car.

You tell that bitch,
she's lucky I didn't kill you.

You got it?

Simple overdose is out,

but he was wasted,
stepped too close to the edge,

even took a tragic leap.

It all works, so long as this bastard's...

Alive?

One person cuts out before Shavasana,
I'm doing 20-to-life.

You don't have it in you.

That's for her.

Robbery-homicide may have to do.

Oh, my God. Help!

- Always stay through Shavasana.
- Help! Somebody call 911!

What are you doing back there?

What the fuck?

Holy shit.

Hey.
You've reached Love Quinn-Goldberg.

Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you soon as I can.

Love, hi, it's me. Where are you?
We need to talk right now.

There's no saying this is bulletproof.

Do you really think she would have
given us a gun if it wasn't?

God, will you just finish already? Oh!

Babe, I am trying.

I don't know how you're so regular
without any soluble fiber.

You know what, Sher,
it's like you think we're on a train.

We'll reach our stop,
the door will magically open.

Right. 'Cause I'm not crawling
up the walls like a moron.

Oh, yeah.

'Cause your plan, unlike my shit,
is proving to be real fucking solid.

Hello?

Love?

You here?

Love?

Love?

You know,

we need to start thinking about the kids.

We really need to consider their future.

That's not just an argument
for me to be the one to get out.

Wait...

Why would thinking about what's best
for the kids be an argument for you?

Name Cole's geo tutor.

Monica.

Monica's math.

Who the fuck has
a geo tutor, Cary? No one!

You know what?

We're not gonna fucking debate
which parent gets to live!

Fuck this.

- What are you doing?
- Stand back!

Man, guy told me this would go
through an engine block.

You shot...

my ear.

Oh, my God.

Shit, shit. Let me...

- Just let me see.
- Stay away from me.

- I know head trauma.
- Stop.

Get
the hell away from me, honey!

Hey!

Hey.

They're murderers, Theo!

We think they killed Gil too.
They blamed it all on him.

Wait. Where's Love?

- What do you mean, "Where's Love?"
- Theo, she's half of it!

Don't be an idiot!

She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her.

Now she's delivering a letter to
a preschool counselor half an hour away.

Like she doesn't have two people
locked in her basement.

She'll be back any minute.

I am not exactly in a position
to lie to you right now, am I?

- Get us out of here, Theo.
- No. You don't know her situation.

- Joe is the one that killed Natalie.
- Joe didn't fucking kill her!

Let us out! Now! Find the key!

Let us out!

You'll never believe that he's dead.

Not just because people like Ryan
never seem to die

but because he taught you that you don't
deserve a second chance, but you do.

We both do.

I don't feel bad about this.

It isn't like what Love does.
She is crazy, impulsive.

But real evil has to be dealt with

and you don't do that by letting it live
to take good people down.

Hey, it's Fiona.

Something happened.

Hey. Wondering if I should put Henry down.

I'm not sure when Joe's coming.
Let me know. No presh.

What?

Hey, Dante.
Yeah, thank you so much for taking him.

Let me double-check with Joe. If I can't
reach him, I'll call you in a sec.

Thank you.

Oh, fuck. You scared me.

What are you doing?

Uh, nothing, nothing.

Um...

Is that a key?

I know that it's not true.

What the Conrads said that you did.

What did the Conrads say I did?

That you killed Natalie.

I found footage from the day
that she disappeared.

It was Joe.

I know what he is.
You don't have to protect him anymore.

I need you to leave.

I need you to leave Madre Linda
and never come back.

Come with me, then.

I can't.

It's my family.

We can never...

see each other...

ever again.

You have to promise me.

Theo, I need you to promise me.

Okay.

I promise.

Whatever you want.

Okay.

Okay, you need to go. Now.

I need you to give me the key back.

Um...

- What about...? What are you...?
- No. Don't worry.

I'm gonna let them out,
the second you leave.

Of course.

Okay.

I'm gonna go.

Goodbye, Love.

Theo, wait.

.......... ********** ..........

Previously on You:

I still believe...

- You okay there, Joe?
- ...in The One.

I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

Now he's threatening me.

Stay away from her.

As long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

How much do you know
about Love's first husband?

Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

And you've been buried in here, obsessed!

Just move on, okay? She's dead!

Get the fuck out now!

Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

- I killed Natalie for you!
- Shut up.

Go.

Fuck this.

- What are you doing?
- Stand back!

You just shot my ear.

She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her!

Get us out of here, Theo.

Shirley Jackson wrote

that suburbia
is where people start to come apart.

I thought I'd escape before
that happened to me, but if I'd done that,

I'd never have met you.

I'm not free...

unless we both are, Marienne.

So I had to. You deserve a man
who does what has to be done.

Right now, I have to save my son
from his mother.

Mr. Mooney used to say
there's a monster inside every boy,

all too easy to feed.

If you make it strong, it will take over.

We can save Henry together.

I just need to get us out

before Love feeds Henry so much
as another bite.

They're saying she moved to Ohio.

Yeah, sure. She left her plants
and the picture of her mom.

It was her boyfriend.

- No. Or maybe she ran away.
- I could've stopped him.

- The last time it ruined my entire life.
- You mean, like, with your mom...?

It made her hate me so much,
she put me here.

So I thought, with Fiona,
I didn't want her to hate me.

For the record, you don't know
how your mom feels. You're making it up.

Hey, trust me, I do it too.

But I'll never actually know
why mine left me here.

Neither will you.

Joe?

I'm home.

Fuck. If she sees blood, it's over.

Joe?

What are you doing in here?

Looking for a charger. That's the one.

What a fucking day.

We need to figure out
how we're gonna endgame the Conrads.

- Brainstorm...
- Something is up with her.

Also, we need to have an alibi.

- So I did get an Airbnb in Mill Valley.
- She's barely looking at me.

Sherry and Cary aren't enough
to throw her this off-balance.

And the bakery, I have an order.

It's a big one, so that'll be good
to keep everything open.

And I had a thought about us.

Is this...

Conrad blood?

- No, that's Theo. He came by the bakery.
- Oh, no.

I, uh... He...

Um, I had to...

That's what she can't look at.

Poor Theo.

He's still there, in the basement.

Fuck. Okay, problem or opportunity?

I'll handle him.
Don't give it another thought.

My epiphany.

I was just thinking,

like, we're gonna be through this
so soon, right?

I hope.

- Right?
- Yeah.

I just think it's perfect, so...
To really fucking start a new chapter.

It's time for us
to try for another baby, Joe.

I'm...

actually speechless.

I want nothing more in the world, Love.

Yeah, let's do it.

Too bad, tomorrow,
Henry and I will be gone.

Of course, this all hinges
on the only question that matters.

When I go...

will you come with me?

I'm sorry.

Theo, hi, it's me.
Can you call me and check in, please?

I was too harsh when I kicked you out...

but you don't have to...

Just let me know you're okay, please.

You poor, dumb kid.

I'm so sorry.

- Come on, man.
- He's not coming back.

It's been hours.

Hey, let me see that.

No.

Sher, I took a survival medicine seminar
with a dude who won Season 6 of Alone.

I can't hear you...

because you shot me in the ear.

It ricocheted.

Tell that to the part of my ear
plastered to that bucket.

- Red flag, okay? This is my turn.
- No. No more techniques.

Love's right.
They are gonna argue to death.

Marriage brings out the worst in us all.

- That's not fair. Just let me...
- Don't! You've done enough.

- You're... You're hysterical.
- Fuck you! That is sexist as shit!

I am a feminist...

who grazed you!

Oh, you wanna know
what grazing feels like?

- Hey, hey!
- Don't get hysterical.

- I took a seminar.
- Hey, hey!

Oh, fuck. I'm gonna need more tarps.

No!

Oh, my God.

- Cary?
- You didn't graze me.

You fucking...

shot me in the leg.

- Hey, I've been trying to reach you.
- Um, Joe...

Ryan's dead.

- What?
- Mugging, apparently.

Been a few in the area. Guy with a knife.

Seems like this just went really bad,
but the police still interrogated me.

I feel like this is gonna blow back on me.

- I just know it.
- This was part of a string of muggings?

Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

- Weren't you with Juliette last night?
- Yes, I was. I have an alibi, but...

I also have a very long history
of being fucked by the system.

A system that was made by and for Ryan.

Can I disagree?

Not about the system
but just about this moment.

I'd love to be wrong.

Listen, the man who hurt you,

who wanted to steal your child...

he is now gone forever.

You shouldn't send the mugger flowers,

but I am saying
this is your life getting easier.

- Promise not to judge?
- No, never.

I'm glad he's dead.

Can I tell you something else
that happened last night?

Love and I are officially separating.

Wait, seriously?

But, like, no, I'm... I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

Don't be.

We're both gonna be free... very soon.

Why don't you get out of town
while this Ryan drama dies down?

- Yeah, we should.
- Just think of some place you wanna go.

Anywhere. And just go.

Hey, Joe.

Come with us.

I know, I know, that's crazy.

No, it's not, it's not.

You've been such a rock,
and I let myself fantasize about a...

About a simple, happy, healthy family
for a second, and when I...

When I picture that, I picture you.
And Henry, of course.

And I know you said you love me,

but it was in a certain moment,
I get that,

but I realized, I actually, um...

I love you.

I love you, and...

Yeah, so that.

That's probably way too much, too soon.

No.

Marienne.

Yes!

Yes. Count us in.

We'd be crazy not to try after everything
we've been through to get here, right?

We just have to tie up a few loose ends.

I can't believe we're doing this.

I can. It's fate.

Mm. Gotta go.

Bunch of songbirds just landed on me
and I think we're going flying.

I'll see you in the sky.

You invited me, we have a future.

This will be the last ugly thing
I ever have to do.

Come on.

Love couldn't even finish the job.
So much for a clean break.

The kid knows everything. If he talks...

Finish it. No one would know.

I'm sorry.

I'm so, so sorry.

I would know.

Didn't I just promise the love of my life

a happy, healthy, new beginning?

I will never...

touch her again.

You think
this is because you kissed my wife?

It was once.

Oh, you fucked my wife?

What a mess my wife has made.

I loved her.

Why did she do this?

This is not your fault. She fooled me too.

Are you gonna...

kill me?

There is a hospital 20 minutes away.
My escape window is closing.

I gotta keep this kid
from blabbing the second he's admitted.

Okay, Theo,

I'm going to give you a little nap,
all right?

Cary Conrad uses this stuff all the time.

So it shouldn't exacerbate
your head injury.

Too much.

Julie.

Julia.

Julia Quinn-Goldberg.

- Who do you think it was?
- Word on the street is mugging.

- "The street"? Name your source.
- I saw a tweet.

From "the street"?

No, we went past the crime scene.

There was a lot of blood.
I bet it was Matthew.

- But why on earth would Matthew...?
- Sherry's blog. They're hiding.

Matthew is insane.

And Ryan reported
on the Natalie investigation.

What if Ryan was asking
too many questions?

Hey, hey, heads up!
Fifty grand coming through.

- Not a fan?
- He's my ex.

What if the only way
to hide the truth was to murder him?

The library fundraiser's coming up.
My boss asked me to work late.

Yeah. He's a gem.

He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up.

Not up to your standards?

Yeah.

Can't all be winners.

Hey, can you make
two dozen bloody-looking ones by tonight?

I'm having my true-crime book club
over to dish.

Yeah, sure.

What's your theory?
I think, his ex, Marienne Bellamy, right?

My lawyer friend said
that they were in a custody fight,

and she seems off, you know?

Her ex becomes all successful
and then when she wants him back,

she can't
and it's, like, crime of passion.

What do you think?

You're all scandal-hungry crows
and no amount of feasting

on other people's sorrows is gonna
make your lives less hollow.

I'm sorry.

PMS.

Right.

- I'll have those cupcakes for you.
- Great. Thank you.

Hey, guys.

Hi.

Get away from me!

- It was only supposed to graze you.
- No! That...

- You just made me so mad!
- That was your pull...

- Hey.
- Hey.

Hey.

- You know, you were right.
- What?

Joe's cheating.

Oh.

Oh.

Love.

Kill him.

He was abusive.

He forced you into this.

I'll back you up. You know I will.
Then you can let me out.

Us.

You can let us out.

Everybody will believe you.
It's always the husbands.

You know, they force us
into these shapes and we break.

But you and me, we're strong, right?

All you gotta do is...

He fucking betrayed you, Love.

You're a fucking monster.

I always knew your marriage was a sham.

But... it looks like the only murderer
in this room is you, Sherry.

I can't believe that you just did that.

Unceremonious,

dumping Theo at a loading dock,
but he's safe.

Now there's no time to pack.

It'll be a miracle if I can get us out
before Love gets suspicious.

- Oh, hey, Joe.
- Hey, Lansing.

Hey, Dante, I'm here to pick up Henry.

- Love picked him up two hours ago?
- Yeah.

No.

- Oh, great.
- Was that not the plan?

No, it sure wasn't.

It was. She texted me
and I spaced, so I'm sorry.

Nice to see you both.

See you.

Oh, no.

She can't know.

Smells amazing.

How could she know?

It's roast chicken.

- Hmm. Where's Henry?
- He's asleep.

- I'm gonna check on him.
- No.

Sit.

She knows.

Mm.

Tastes amazing as ever.

- I'm a great cook.
- You are.

You really are.

And I'm great in bed.

Pretty, funny, devoted wife and mom.

It's all true.

Hey, did you check out Twitter today?

A news guy was murdered.

Ryan Goodwin.

I was like, "Where do I know him from?"

So I Googled him, and...

he's your boss's ex-husband.

And I saw him at the library thing.

Where I saw her.

Marienne.

She was lovely.

Stunning, actually.

- Love...
- Do you love her?

I just want the truth.

Oh.

Did you ever actually love me?

The moment I saw you.

I would do anything for you.

I know that you cheated on me
and you lied.

Okay, can we...?

You made me feel like you really saw me.

Like you were perfectly happy.

You made me feel
like I needed to protect you.

You got so upset
killing objectively horrible people.

So I thought, "He's sensitive.
I can do this for him."

I don't remember you asking.

And then I come to find out
that you are happy to murder,

just for a different woman.

Meanwhile, here I am doing it for you.

A teenager, someone innocent.

Yeah, right. He's just a kid,
who you were having an affair with.

We can do this if you are willing to admit
you have not been perfectly happy either.

We have both made mistakes.

I have made some...

big ones.

And I'm sorry, Love.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I tried, and I know
that you've been trying too.

But it didn't work.

And now we can be honest about that

and deal with this like two adults.

- Meaning what?
- We don't have to do anything impulsive.

What's that mean?

James. James.

What you did to him
when he tried to leave.

- Your mother knew and she told me.
- My mother is a malicious bitch.

All I'm saying is
that we can part ways amicably.

Be there for Henry,
support him, co-parent,

and give each other
the chance to be happy.

Love...

I want a divorce.

I'm gonna go check on him.

- Let me get...
- No, I'll check him. I'll get him.

She may come back with Henry or a machete.

Henry's settled down.

You look like you're gonna throw up.

Well, I just said the D-word to my wife.

Okay, yeah, that's fair.

Look, Joe...

I don't like feeling like this.

- I'm so sorry. I...
- No. No.

You're right.

I always thought
that if I did everything right,

life would turn out
the way it's supposed to.

Doesn't that seem reasonable?

I mean, like, with James...

I took care of him.

Doesn't it seem reasonable to think

that he'd wanna be with me
when he got better?

But...

Here's what I need you
to know about James.

My mom was right.

I did.

I did kill him.

But I didn't mean to.

That was my first time using it, and...

the dosage was too high when ingested.

What dosage was too high?

Aconite.

It's a paralytic.

I just wanted to...

I just wanted to stop him.

Keep him in one place
so we could talk it through.

- You wanted to paralyze him?
- Exactly. Yeah.

Temporarily.

Now, you don't have to worry.

This time,
I'm letting it absorb through the skin.

Oh, no. No, no, no.

Do I need to point out
that none of this would be happening

if you hadn't grabbed a weapon?

Oh, wow.

No one will ever love you like I do, Joe.

It's something to think about
while you're lying there.

Okay, this isn't great.

Love...

Apparently, I need
to deliver some cupcakes.

I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

Then... I'm gonna save
our fucking marriage.

What the fuck am I gonna do now?

Theo, come on, answer your texts.

Look, we're mad, that's fine.
But now I'm worried.

Call me back or I'm calling the police.
I'm serious.

Hello?

Joe?

Theo!

Theo!

- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

What the fuck did she do to you?

What's going on? Is Theo here?

Thank you.
If I could just get my voice to work...

Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

No! Shit. He calls the police,
truth comes out and I lose Henry.

What? What?

What are you trying to say?

- You don't want me to call the police?
- Yes! Yes, thank you.

What?

You have Theo.

Uh-huh.

Where is he?

Joe, what did she do?

Where is my son?

In the hospital. In the hospital!

You know what Love's been doing
with him, don't you?

You sick fuck!

You took Natalie from me, didn't you?

Didn't you?

Your crazy fucking wife.

You knew, and you sat in my house
and you said nothing.

I should kill you.

I should kill you right fucking now.

- What?
- Follow my eyes.

Come on. I'm pointing with my eyes.

Check the search history.
You're a tech guy, you know this.

Saint Benedict's Hospital?
This is where Theo is?

- I'm blinking. Yes.
- That what you're saying?

He better be okay.

Yeah.

No police.

No fucking help.

You deserve what Natalie got
a hundred times over, neighbor.

Enjoy whatever Love does to you.

What are you even doing?

The weak spot will reveal itself.

- Weak spots always do.
- Okay.

Maybe we should talk about
what I said when Love was here.

I admire it.

I'm over here trying to save us both
and you've got strategy.

Will you leave the wall alone?

No.

Because whether you love me
or even respect me,

I can figure out a simple cage.

I hacked my body. I hacked the shit
out of our marriage. I can hack this.

What was so bad about our marriage?

What are you talking about?

You hack everything.

Ovulation, child-rearing.

Sure. To get it right.

- To be good enough for you.
- That's hilarious.

I mean it!

Or have you forgotten
that you were a golden boy

and I was this uptight grad student
in huge glasses

- who your mom hated.
- My mom hates everyone.

And I loved you in those glasses.

I've loved every version of you, Sherry.

Everything I've done
since the day I laid eyes on you...

it was for you.

- Guess I'm an idiot.
- You're not.

- You're not.
- You know, Sherry,

until I met you,

I had massive inflammation,

undiagnosed lactose intolerance,

and I did coke every weekend.

I was just powering through
until I met you

and I saw,

she's together, she is optimized.

She is so much smarter than me.

Honey...

I didn't fall in love with you
'cause you were smart.

Ow, ow.

Oh, sweetie.

Come here, come here.

That's okay.

That's okay.

- The truth came out.
- No, no, I wasn't even...

You are smart.

I just mean, I fell for...

sweet and brave...

slay-any-dragon...

smart-enough-to-know-that-I'm-smarter-
but-you-don't-mind-that.

I love that.

You're the best dad to the best kids.

And don't forget 6% body fat.

You're down to...? Jesus.

When we get out of here,
you're gonna have all the burgers.

And you'll be the hottest
one-eared bitch in Madre Linda.

Hey.
I'm gonna put him to bed, he's asleep.

This is not
how I imagined this ending.

Us ending.

Me.

Perfect. I got here just in time.

Okay.

Don't you worry, Joe.

It's gonna be over real soon.

Oh, hey, I...

Got a text from Joe? That was me.

Come in?

- Yeah, no. I should...
- If you have any self-respect,

you'll come in,
so we can speak like adults.

Okay, sure.

Don't fall for it.
She's gonna kill you.

We'll only have this conversation once.

But I need to know,
of all the men in Madre Linda,

why my husband?

Fuck. He told me
that you two are separating...

He did? Oh. That's news to me.

- I am sorry. What?
- He lied.

Get out. Get out.

I'm so sorry. I...

He told me you two were splitting. I...

I really never would have...

Look, I'm... I'm a good person.

Or maybe I'm not, but I am trying.

You didn't answer my question.

Why Joe?

Was he kind to you?

Effortlessly get you?

Smart? Deep?

Good father material?

Yes.

- At first.
- What's that supposed to mean?

I should've trusted my gut.

Something in me knew
that it was too good to be true,

but I just...

He convinced me.

I let him convince me.

I used to think that toxic men looked
at me and saw an easy mark.

And I've looked at myself...

and something in me
that's attracted to toxicity.

No, don't throw yourself under the bus.

She's distorting things.

"Toxic"?

What if I told you
Joe's the one who killed your ex?

No, Ryan was...

No, Ryan was mugged.

Uh-huh.

Why would...?

- Why would Joe...?
- To protect you.

Because he's obsessed with you.

No, I saved you. I did a good thing.

When he's obsessed with someone,
he'll do anything.

I should know.

He was obsessed with me...

until he met you.

Mom?

- Hey.
- I have to pee.

Okay, sweetie. I'm almost done, okay?

Give me five minutes.

Oh, you know what?
You can go use the restroom down the hall.

Yeah.

Yeah. Okay.

Come on, baby.

Hi.

Go straight in there,
around the corner.

Look this way. Look. Come on.

Shit.

Marienne?

Um...

You... and your beautiful daughter,
you need to run.

Disappear.

Ryan's the beginning of what he'll do.

Say you don't believe her.

Say you love me, you trust me.

Then why aren't you running too?

It's not that simple for me.

No.

Okay, listen to me,
maybe it's not my place,

but maybe you think you owe it to your kid
or you're clinging to when things worked,

but, please, if there is ever...

even for a fleeting moment,

a tiny voice in your head,

and that tiny voice is telling you,
"I deserve better"...

listen to her.

That's your partner.

That's your real, true love.

And if you betray her long enough,
you will lose her.

Trust me, I'm still trying
to get mine back.

Mom?

Hey, baby.

Hey.

- Thank you.
- Of course.

You ready? Okay, come on.

Did you believe Love's lies?

You knew it was a trap.
You would've said anything to get out.

A luxury I don't seem to have.

I'd see why you like her.

Tough.

She's got a cute kid.

I can't believe I almost took
that little girl's mother away from her.

The insanity you drive me to, Joe.

Marienne's gonna be fine. More than fine.

She really makes being
a single mother look good.

Noble.

I barely recognize myself anymore.

I was so...

excited.

To be a mother.

And your wife.

And as soon as I became that...

you punished me for it.

I mean, you gaslit me so fucking hard.

I started to question...

every single thing about myself.

But that little voice
in the back of my head

that I've been suppressing
this whole fucking time, it was right.

I'm not the problem.

My husband is the problem.

Aconite, when injected directly,

burns as it moves
through the system to the heart.

Think less slow paralysis,

more total fucking agony.

I'm sorry it had to come to this.

Did you really think
that I wouldn't start to wonder...

what you were growing in the garden?

Wolf's-bane.

- A paralytic.
- No.

It slows the heart.

So I Googled antidotes.

Turns out, I needed biohacking.
Adrenaline.

And who doesn't have that
around here, right?

A little voice in my head
told me to take it.

Before you played your hand.

Joe...

You did this to yourself.

And the hardest part was making
the dose because I couldn't lie to myself.

It had to be enough.

I had to finally stop you.

We're perfect for each other.

But bad...

for Henry.

He'll know what you are.

Those sadistic, tacky,
Los Angeles, little bitches.

Hey.

Hey, don't give up on me, baby.

No, baby. Give me a flag, Cary.

Cary, give me a flag!

Sexy.

No!

No, no, no!

No, we're not letting them win, baby. No!

They'll turn on each other.

Those two-faced, vanilla pieces of shit.

There's a key in here.

Those freaky bitches
don't trust each other.

Baby, they're the weak spot.

They're the weak spot.

All I've ever wanted
was to give Henry

the best life I could imagine.

But what if Love was right?

Maybe she will take the fall
for this whole mess,

but I'm married to her.

If I go down too...

what happens to our son?

After Dottie's meltdown,
Love drew up papers

to prevent the Quinns from ever getting
near him, but if not them or me, then...

I can't let him get put
somewhere like I was.

Jacob?

Jakey, let's go.

Such a nice day, right?

There's nothing I'd rather do
than be with you, buddy.

Done?

Oh, my God.

- Joey? How did you find...?
- Do you hate me?

- What?
- You think I'm bad.

What I did.

- Joey...
- Mom, what's wrong with me?

I know you try so hard to be good.

Then why'd you leave me there?

And why are you taking care of him?

I just...

I made too many mistakes.

And even though I loved you,
still love you...

I was hurting you too.

Sometimes we need to start over, Joey.

Completely.

I didn't have good parents.

But I know what a good parent does.

Protect.

Even if that means protecting from.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

This isn't forever.

I love you more than anything.

Hey.

I don't know what to say.

Be good.

Yes?

Friends and neighbors...

I'd like to thank you for welcoming
my family with open arms,

but... you didn't.

âª I think I've seen this film before âª

âª And I didn't like the ending âª

âª You're not my homeland anymore âª

âª So what am I defendin' now? âª

âª You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out âª

âª I think I've seen this film before... âª

I moved to the suburbs
because I bought into the dream.

Community, prosperity,

and most of all, safety.

But I never felt safe here.

Judged from day one,

for my past, my body,

how I was raising my child.

If I wasn't perfect, I would lose it all.

A game so rigged, it could only exist
in a world that hates women,

especially mothers.

But what choice did I have?

So I played.

And I realized your fence,

your doorbell cam,

you tell yourself you're keeping
your family safe, but it's a lie.

You're too afraid to do what you need
to do to really protect your own.

âª I'm not your problem anymore âª

âª So who am I offending now? âª

âª You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out... âª

I am not a coward.

I do what must be done
to protect my family.

I killed the adulterer next door.

I framed the anti-vaxxer
who sickened my child,

hunted down the reporter
who threatened us.

I trapped the couple
who tried to sabotage us.

Forced them to really see each other.

Babe.

God is good!

She is good.

âª So step right out âª

âª There is no amount âª

âª Of cryin' I can do for you âª

âª All this time âª

âª We always walked a very thin line âª

- âª You didn't even hear me out âª
- âª You didn't even hear me out âª

- âª You never gave a warning sign âª
- âª I gave so many signs âª

- âª I never learned to read your mind âª
- âª Never learned to read my mind âª

- âª I couldn't turn things around âª
- âª You never turned things around âª

- âª 'Cause you never gave a warning sign âª
- âª I gave so many signs... âª

I forced my husband to play along.

But in the end, he was a coward too.

And when I realized
he had grown to hate me,

I killed him.

Better than a messy divorce.

Everybody keeps their dignity.

When the shock wears off...

and you feel safe jogging
in your expensive athleisure again...

...remember, you can
get off the hamster wheel at any time.

You just have to be willing
to burn it to the ground.

In the end, it worked.

There was just enough
half-charred evidence to tell the tale,

including the remains of two human toes,
which were DNA tested.

RIP, me.

Love's farewell filled out details
a burned-out crime scene couldn't.

The rest of Joe Goldberg's body
was never found,

but it was presumed butchered or worse.

Love Quinn became
the Mrs. Lovett of Madre Linda.

Once the nausea passed,
people were ravenous for her.

Her tragic family history,

her quasi-feminist revolt
against upper-class hypocrisy.

A bit of a folk hero,

more famous even than Guinevere Beck.

And without my family
poisoning the well...

Madre Linda began to heal.

Beep, beep.

Hey.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

- How'd it go?
- Oh, you know.

Killed physical therapy, walked 75 yards,

did some intermittent dancing.

Yeah, we should sign up for a 5K.

- A 5K, huh?
- Yeah.

Okay. I'm in if you're in.

Good work, Henry!

Henry arrived
into Dante and Lansing's life

with a note expressing my last wish.

That they protect Henry
as if he were their own son.

Nobody says no to a man
who got turned into a pie.

No, it wasn't fair of me,

but it was the right thing for Henry.

After a long legal battle,

Dottie, bereaved and still not sober,

yielded custody to Dante and Lansing.

Someday when he's old enough,
he can read the rest of the note.

But that's between him and me.

Didn't take long for the town to regroup.

Jackson and Andrew took over
the bakery with a winky rebrand,

Well-Behaved Women.

Yelp suggests the scones are just okay.

The Insta-friendly shirts
are the real draw.

Kiki and Brandon struck gold

when Brandon developed
an at-home poison test

and accompanying app,

after which Kiki named their new baby.

Toxi. Their child's name is Toxi.

We thought,
instead of being prisoners of the cage,

why not master it?

Somehow,
Sherry and Cary made it out alive.

Their first move: use Sherry's blog
to savage Love Quinn

and turn themselves
into the real heroes of the story.

Their next move: write a book, of course.

Caged: A Radical Couple's
Therapy Technique.

As for you,

Marienne,

I looked for you,
but you and Juliette were already gone.

Phone number changed,
no forwarding address.

The end of our story remains unwritten.

Did you pity me
when you read what happened?

Did it erase the fear she planted?
Do you still think about us?

Can't believe how many people left
New York after the pandemic.

Way before that. The election?

But I have to believe
our paths are destined to cross again.

Marriage almost ruined both of us,
but we escaped.

Maybe the scars in our hearts
make them stronger.

Nick!

Nick?

All I know, mon amour...

is I'll search the world if I have to.

I will find you.
