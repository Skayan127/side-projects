1
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,052
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
Everyone just calls me Beck.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,556
And you're Joe?

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,598
Goldberg.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,392
A guy needs to protect himself.

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,311
And your name
was a glorious place to start.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,356
The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,864
-...we could get a drink sometime?
-Sure.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,407
Hey. Let me up.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,743
God, you make me insane.

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,203
Beck, who is this?

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,165
Benjamin J. Ashby.
Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

13
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,208
-After you.
-All right.

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,002
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,631
Do not tell me that you're doing this
because of Beck.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,467
I'm very scared
of what you would do to her.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,094
She show you her ladle?
She's got this red kitchen ladle.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,263
It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank-me thing.

19
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,973
Benji, I'd love your help.

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,726
Unfortunately, I know
you're a pathological liar.

21
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,648
I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,734
So I did what I had to do to help you.

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,665
It's been three days
since our first kiss.

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,753
I have to say, things are looking
pretty good for us, post-Benji.

25
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,547
If you could only watch one movie
for the rest of your life,

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,758
-what would it be?
-Beverly Hills Cop.

27
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,135
-Really?
-Yeah, dead serious.

28
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,222
Okay, I'll bite. Enlighten me.

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,642
Well, it's funny,
but the danger feels very real.

30
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,852
It checks all the boxes.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,272
-What's yours? What's your forever movie?
-Mmm.

32
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,401
I have to go with Pretty in Pink.

33
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,945
Invisible townie girl
swept off her feet

34
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,823
by the one guy who really sees her?

35
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,282
It's a little on the nose, Beck.

36
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,617
I love that movie.

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,789
I'll be that guy. The one who sees you.
You deserve that after Benji.

38
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,873
So...

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,252
your old girlfriend,

40
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,796
that girl at Peach's party
was talking about,

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,880
Candace, is it?

42
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,008
It's customary,
the inventory of past heartbreak.

43
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,802
- Do I want to know?
- But Candace.

44
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,512
I'm not sure
how to tell you about her yet.

45
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,097
It's too soon, Beck.

46
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,392
I mean, I'm an open book.
But it's the old story.

47
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,395
Just thinking you're right for someone,

48
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,188
and you're not.

49
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,732
Hmm. I got about a dozen of those.

50
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,318
-Hmm.
-Maybe sometime over a drink.

51
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,279
Or ten.

52
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,406
-Yeah.
-Ten?

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,242
Ten. Ten, give or take.

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,713
I want to come in. I do.
But I'm gonna make us wait.

55
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,423
You're worth waiting for. Besides...

56
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,507
Bye.

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,177
Right now, I have something
rather pressing to deal with.

58
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,003
"Grab and go"? Really?
"Townie pie"? What the...

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,297
You're dead to me, Benji. Dead.

60
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,592
You're finally moving on.

61
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,888
And now that you've dealt with Benji,
it's time for me to do the same.

62
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,112
How exactly does one get rid of a body?

63
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,156
I can't just google this kind of thing

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,700
without creating
a pretty damning evidence trail.

65
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:07,956
So, I turn to those I trust most for tips.
King, Carr, Franzen, Flynn.

66
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,126
Fun fact: spatchcocking a chicken
and dismembering a human

67
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,128
involve the same six essential steps.

68
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,382
Not sure I'm down for that.
Little intense.

69
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,260
But I think I finally have a plan
for Benji.

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,846
Hey, Joe. I didn't know you were up there.

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,599
Do you mind
if I play some Enrique Iglesias?

72
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,434
I'm trying to bone up on my Spanish.

73
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,978
- Officially the darkest days...
- Sounds great.

74
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,729
-...in the world's history.
-I could pick something else.

75
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:37,068
I got a ton of playlists on here.
I got rock music, club music, jazz music.

76
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,653
I wonder if he's a virgin.

77
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,612
Stick with the Iglesias.

78
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,114
I'll be in the basement
working on some books.

79
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,615
I don't want to be disturbed. All right?

80
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,659
No problem. Thanks, Joe.

81
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,703
Here's what I know.

82
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,664
There can be no dead Benji
for you to mourn.

83
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,165
He needs to disappear.

84
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,377
Already handled the optics
on social media.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,588
Portrait of a dude
hard-partying his way off the grid.

86
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,674
As for the body,

87
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,677
cremation seems expedient.

88
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,888
This will require chemicals,
a steady blaze,

89
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,599
and absolutely no dental records.

90
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,866
Yeah. It looks like I'm gonna need to
slow the biological roll on Benji.

91
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,368
It's about temperature
and it's about humidity.

92
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,080
And dropping the temp this low
puts the books at risk.

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,208
Dry, brittle, lost forever.

94
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,627
My humidifiers won't let that happen.

95
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,090
Gertrude Stein is dead.
She's not coming back to sign books.

96
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,345
Hopefully, this holds him
until I can man up and do the deed.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,222
Come in.

98
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,185
Hi, there. I'm Guinevere Beck.

99
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,854
I'm your new MFA transfer.

100
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,857
Professor Leahy and I agreed
that it would be better...

101
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,779
Sorry. I'm looking for Professor Mott?

102
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,072
Beck, is it?

103
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,907
-Yes. Hi.
-Blythe.

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
-I heard you were joining us.
-Oh. Yeah.

105
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,412
We meet here for workshop
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

106
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
Mott's no Leahy, though,
so bring your A game.

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,126
I intend to. You know, I actually...

108
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,212
I read one of your essays
in the Review last month,

109
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,757
and it was so illuminating.
I mean, I tweeted it.

110
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,511
Social media.
It's like the next great genocide.

111
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,722
Jersey, right?

112
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,641
-Sorry?
-That's where you're from?

113
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,685
No, I'm from Nantucket.

114
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,938
Oh, interesting.

115
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,526
-Where are you from?
-Such a tough question.

116
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,903
Um, I was born in Papua New Guinea,

117
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,988
but my dad worked
for the State Department,

118
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,156
so we moved around a lot.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,242
I actually separated from my parents
at one point.

120
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,910
Did some modeling in Tokyo.

121
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,205
My hair's super unique there.

122
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,885
I'm sorry.
It's my grandparents.

123
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,262
I'll see you in class, okay?

124
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,097
- Okay.
- Okay.

125
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,808
Hey. Yeah?

126
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,062
And then she walked away,
and I melted into the earth.

127
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,148
Sounds like a pretentious bitch,
if you ask me.

128
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,774
No. Blythe's amazing.

129
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,235
She wrote this piece
about how she and her mother

130
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,655
got bulimia together while in Italy.
And she was 12.

131
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,074
- Chic.
- What the... Is that a nose?

132
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,618
It's a dick pic, Annika.

133
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,246
-See? Look. It's just zoomed in.
-No. No.

134
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,498
Why is it against shag carpet?

135
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,042
- I don't know. Perspective?
- I don't get it.

136
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,463
I mean, why do men think
disembodied members equal foreplay?

137
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,591
-They're not aesthetically pleasing.
-Ooh, I disagree.

138
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,261
I have over 200 saved on my phone,
organized by category.

139
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,304
It's my Guggenheim.

140
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:57,935
I got fat bats, boomerangs, banana boats,

141
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,688
late bloomers and Jewish guys.

142
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,064
More power to 'em,

143
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,358
but your friends kind of treat sex
like it means nothing.

144
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,818
Junk in zoom.

145
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,820
- But you're different, aren't you?
- Why am I not surprised?

146
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,199
Honestly, I see her point.
I hooked up with some guy last night.

147
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,453
Knee-deep in before I realize
he's uncircumcised.

148
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,122
It kind of looked like,
I don't know, a hoodie?

149
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,458
- Whoa!
- Bookstore clerk has a turtleneck?

150
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,752
Bookstore manager. But no, not Joe.

151
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,796
Some guy from Tinder.
Just a little down and dirty, you know?

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,633
- Wow.
- Joe is still a maybe.

153
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,469
A "maybe"? I'm a "maybe"?

154
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,430
And you're still screwing other guys?
Beck!

155
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,850
How did I miss this?
How did I read this so completely wrong?

156
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,062
Look, if you want
to bone Benji out of your system,

157
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:41,979
more power to you.

158
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,649
I just want to make sure
that you're respecting yourself.

159
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,109
Look, I'm just saying...

160
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,364
are you being
your most amazing self right now?

161
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,075
I mean, this is... This is my process.

162
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,369
It's like a Benji exorcism.

163
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,707
I'm just exploring my options
in a city of eight million people.

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,501
-It's only reasonable, right?
-Yeah.

165
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,835
I'm gonna get a drink.

166
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,258
I like your tattoo.

167
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,511
I don't have a tattoo.

168
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,390
Love is patient and kind.
And so am I, Beck.

169
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,018
For you, I can be patient.
Maybe this is your process.

170
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,564
Nobody buys the first pair of jeans
they try on, no matter how perfect.

171
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,984
But as much as I'm hoping
this is just a stage,

172
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,528
a quick password search
on your iCloud has revealed

173
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,363
a swipe-fest of millennial man-boys.

174
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,950
Guy with tiger.
Junior William Morris agent.

175
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,578
Viking wannabe.
You've been a busy girl, Beck.

176
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,621
It's more competition than I realized.

177
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:46,043
This thing between us, it's new, tenuous.
And the cost was a corpse.

178
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,588
But I can't get rid of every guy
in New York.

179
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,966
If I want to win your heart,
I'm gonna have to show you.

180
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,057
I'm not a "maybe." I'm the one.

181
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,023
It's time.

182
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:12,945
Time to get rid of Benji, so I can focus
my undivided attention on you, Beck.

183
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,238
On us.

184
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,490
So, I'm gonna need a few supplies.

185
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,993
Hey, Joe. You said you needed to talk?

186
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,412
I do, yeah. So, here's the thing.

187
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,082
I have a secret project I'm working on,
but I got to open up the shop.

188
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,460
So, I thought you could
run some errands for me.

189
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,546
I'll give you a little money for books?
Just between us.

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,467
Yeah. No problem. Between us.
What do you need?

191
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,260
Well, you might have to run
to a few different places.

192
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,392
You can count on me, Joe.

193
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,148
Thanks, Pac.

194
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,320
"The swine and I

195
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,448
Eye to eye

196
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,202
My heart is his

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,831
And that was sunset"

198
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,216
I'm not sure it had the vigilance or depth
that you're capable of.

199
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,176
I just wasn't fully invested.

200
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,720
Interesting, Blythe.

201
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,348
How do we maintain the reader's attention?

202
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,811
We infuse the universal
with painful specificity.

203
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,272
- Or they simply turn the page.
- Exactly.

204
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,402
My worst fear, and I'm not commenting
on Yuri's poem, per se,

205
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,987
is not to be bad, but unremarkable.

206
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,532
Unremarkable. That is the fear.

207
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,284
I hope this was helpful, Yuri?

208
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,328
I think that does it for today.

209
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,457
Next up is Blythe. And Beck.

210
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,752
Send a piece of your choosing
to myself and your fellow classmates,

211
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,129
and we'll review on Thursday.

212
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,131
Okay.

213
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,368
Here's what I've gleaned from
this little exercise in futility, Beck.

214
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,120
You're in no mood to write.

215
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,624
And you need a new bed.

216
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,712
So, hey, maybe your enthusiastic
but ultimately empty encounter

217
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,756
with that Warby Parker-wearing mixologist
could work to our advantage.

218
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,343
I've got time to kill
while Paco's shopping.

219
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,016
You read my mind.

220
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,937
But I have to play this perfectly.

221
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,107
And in order to do that,
I got to break out the big gun.

222
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,654
Mr. Mooney's Buick Skylark.

223
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,784
You bound down the stairs in those tight,
not-too-tight jeans.

224
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,537
You're in flip-flops
and your toenails sparkle,

225
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,914
and your hair is in a bun,

226
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,917
and at least you don't have any hickies,
so there's that.

227
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this is your car!

228
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,719
Uh, you're a life-saver.

229
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,889
You have no idea
how much I need a new bed.

230
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,701
New challenge.

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,956
How do I segue this
from browsing glassware

232
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,084
to, "Holy shit! Joe's the one"?

233
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,462
Weird.

234
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,049
I have one just like this.

235
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,594
Yeah, I know all about it.
Benji told me.

236
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,221
It was my dad's.

237
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,183
The infamous red ladle.
How you like to be spanked with it.

238
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,060
Is that what you really want, Beck?

239
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,438
Is that the guy you're looking for?

240
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,026
Just pick one.

241
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,113
It's all cut
from the same hunk of over-priced wood.

242
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,447
I can't decide.

243
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,117
People trying to buy
some sort of meaning in their lives

244
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,536
with $60 candles and sustainable lamps.

245
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,746
I mean, they all look pretty good to me.

246
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,917
No. I just mean, should I get the queen-
or the king-sized bed?

247
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,044
Your bedroom isn't big enough
to fit a king.

248
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,963
You're right. It's too...

249
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,216
How do you know that?

250
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,598
It's New York. No one's bedroom
is big enough to fit a king.

251
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,271
What's wrong?

252
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,858
This girl, Blythe, in workshop.
She just submitted her short story.

253
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,861
And?

254
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,655
And I haven't even started mine,
and it's due tomorrow.

255
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,367
God.

256
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,703
Hers...

257
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,663
It's brilliant.

258
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,043
It's about a crow
that flies into a woman's house,

259
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,420
runs into the walls
and leaves blood everywhere.

260
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,630
That sounds terrible.

261
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,341
Read it.

262
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
Well?

263
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,857
You might be right.

264
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,901
I know.

265
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,823
Can I ask you something?

266
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,492
Anything.

267
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,243
Promise to tell the truth?

268
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,663
Scout's honor.

269
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,712
Do you think I'm unremarkable?

270
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,058
Unremarkable people don't worry
about being unremarkable.

271
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,365
This is it, Beck.
This is the moment.

272
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,826
I'm gonna show you
just how remarkable you are.

273
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,703
You want it down and dirty? You got it.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,712
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What? I thought that you...

275
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
That I wanted to get arrested

276
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,090
for you going all bush diver on me
in public?

277
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,883
It's not exactly on my to-do list today.

278
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,597
I guess I read that wrong.

279
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,187
You haven't made eye contact
for the past ten minutes.

280
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,273
Things couldn't get any worse right now.

281
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,777
Hello?

282
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,029
Hey, Joe. It's Ethan.

283
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,405
-Ethan from the bookstore.
-Yeah.

284
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,948
Yeah, I know who you are, Ethan.

285
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,285
Right. Thing is, the power's out.

286
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,830
Um, the electrician says
he thinks the system is overloaded,

287
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,373
but he can't
get to the fuse box because...

288
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,125
It's in the basement
with a dead body.

289
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,209
...which is locked.

290
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,046
He thinks he can pop the lock,
but I just wanted to, you know...

291
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,338
No! No, no, no.

292
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,633
Just tell the electrician to go home.
I'll call him later.

293
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,801
You lock up and go home.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,345
I'll deal with it when I get back,
all right?

295
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,222
Okay.

296
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,185
Everything okay?

297
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah, it's fine.
It's just a little problem at the shop.

298
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,230
I should get you home.

299
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,986
I was afraid this might happen.
Six humidifiers

300
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,490
and an AC unit from the late '70s
cranked to its lowest setting.

301
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,535
Even in death,
Benji is a colossal pain in my ass.

302
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,544
Okay. With the AC out,

303
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,923
seems deterioration speed's
really picked up.

304
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,354
Oh!

305
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
Is that ooze?

306
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,028
Things have grown biologically dire
in the Benji department.

307
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,947
Also, the rare book department.

308
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,784
But I can't protect them
until I get rid of him.

309
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,246
Benji has to go.

310
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,893
Hey, what're you up to?

311
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,312
Do you happen to read Chinese?

312
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
Or own a mallet?

313
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,573
The books are safe.
Basement is 100% corpse-free.

314
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,949
Can't burn the body
in the daylight, anyway.

315
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,244
So, the least Benji can do
is wait in the car for a little while.

316
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,834
- All right. Ready for that.
- Ready? Okay.

317
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,502
Okay, let go for a second.

318
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,212
- Okay.
- Yeah.

319
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,798
- It's in the peg!
- Okay.

320
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,342
- Hand me the mallet.
- Yeah.

321
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,600
Should be good.

322
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,101
- Can you do that? That's perfect.
- Ready?

323
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,742
There it is! Go!

324
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:03,994
Say when.

325
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,707
When. When. When.

326
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,673
Cheers to us.

327
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,301
You make a good apprentice.

328
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,554
I was gonna say the same thing about you.

329
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,271
I'm sorry about earlier.
I didn't mean to get so upset.

330
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,608
It's okay.

331
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,401
No. It's not. It's just...

332
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,866
I don't want you to think of me like that.

333
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,169
I like you, Joe.

334
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,756
Like, actually like.

335
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,056
And I was a little in my head,
to be honest.

336
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,434
Blythe's short story
kind of threw me for a loop.

337
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
It's not a competition.

338
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,356
I know, but I wonder...

339
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,026
Am I ever gonna write anything
that amazing?

340
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,364
-You're talented.
-You don't know that.

341
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,908
I know you need to get out of your head.

342
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,455
Forget Blythe. This Blythe person.

343
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,457
Forget everybody.
Just write what you want.

344
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,919
God. Everyone says that like it's so easy.

345
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,213
I know. I know. Okay, so...

346
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,466
Pop quiz.

347
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,176
Don't think.

348
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,846
-Just answer.
-Okay.

349
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,184
What hits you like a gut punch,
when you... The first thought.

350
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,436
My dad.

351
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,479
Before he...

352
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,566
Yeah, right.

353
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,027
Of course.

354
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,490
He was an addict.

355
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,576
It was hard.

356
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,829
And scary.

357
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,417
I mean, there were good days, too.

358
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,087
Like, I always knew
it was gonna be one of those

359
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,508
when I woke up
to the smell of pancakes cooking.

360
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,388
He used this red ladle
to scoop up the batter.

361
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,517
This is the red ladle story?

362
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:41,860
And I would be laughing,
singing along to some bad Top 40 song.

363
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,698
When everything would be right.

364
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,414
But then he'd go out and...

365
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,751
the ladle would go back in the drawer...

366
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,963
and I'd wait for the next good day.

367
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,968
Until there weren't any more.

368
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,808
Wow.

369
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,769
I did not expect to say all that.

370
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,813
I think you're right.

371
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,899
You definitely don't have
anything meaningful to write about.

372
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,983
Ooh!

373
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,778
Benji was wrong about all of it.

374
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,073
His whole red ladle story.
You don't want to be spanked.

375
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,284
You want to feel safe. Loved.

376
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,621
You want someone to make pancakes for you.

377
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,043
Here.

378
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,358
Um... Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

379
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
Coming!

380
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,741
- Is everything okay?
- No.

381
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,618
- Thank God you're here.
- Peach.

382
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,536
- I texted you.
- I should've known.

383
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,621
I'm having a really bad flare-up.

384
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,332
I think I need you to take me
to the emergency room.

385
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,212
Oh, Joseph. Didn't realize you were here.

386
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,423
I told you he was coming.

387
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,925
Peach is really sick.

388
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,637
I mean, this is probably more
than you need to know,

389
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,432
but I have a rare chronic bladder disease
called interstitial cystitis.

390
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,350
Gosh!

391
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,770
I mean, you know,
some people think I'm being uppity,

392
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,481
but I can't have any fast food.

393
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,526
And if I drink, it has to be a high pH,

394
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,447
you know, like Ketel One,
or Goose and pear juice.

395
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,116
Weren't you doing Jäger shots
at your party?

396
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,412
- Let's get you to the hospital.
- Yeah.

397
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,499
Joe has a car. He can take us.
Right, Joe? You can take us?

398
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,460
Of course.

399
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,714
I mean, I've got a dead body in the
trunk, but, hey, no biggie, right?

400
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,634
This is taking forever.

401
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,427
He took the worst street
to get across town.

402
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,845
Be nice.

403
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,347
I'm in real pain.

404
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,682
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,479
- Joseph.
- Yeah.

406
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm feeling nauseated.
Can you crack a window?

407
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,860
There's like a sort of putrid aroma
that keeps wafting in the back seat.

408
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,571
What can I say? Smells of the city.

409
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,287
Oh, God. I can't deal. I can't deal!

410
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,289
We'll walk. Need to get out of this.

411
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm so sorry.

412
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,133
It's almost the witching hour.

413
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,678
Grab the supplies,
drive the narcissistic cadaver,

414
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,888
formerly known as Benji,
to his final destination,

415
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,141
light a match,
and I'm yours forever, Beck.

416
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, this is a development.

417
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,648
That's him.

418
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,368
"Potassium nitrate.
Six rolls of duct tape.

419
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,663
Fire starter. Twine. Burlap. Wood stakes."

420
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,165
You want to explain what all this is for?

421
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,794
Explain the shopping list straight
out of Body Disposal for Dummies?

422
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,797
I know.

423
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,424
I know how this all must look.

424
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,051
I know involving Paco
was the wrong thing to do,

425
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,138
but things have been
a little crazy for me lately.

426
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,849
I guess I was hoping
I could make the world a better place.

427
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,274
You know what?
It would just be easier if I show you.

428
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,280
Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

429
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,785
Technically, we're not allowed
to plant anything in here.

430
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,787
I was just trying to keep it
a bit under wraps.

431
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,622
And the chemicals?

432
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,624
They dissolve roots.

433
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,251
Fire starter?

434
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,211
I like to grill.

435
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,133
Here.

436
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,347
There you go.

437
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,934
-It's good.
-Thank you.

438
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,936
So, he built a garden. So what?

439
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,981
I told this guy,
stay away from my girlfriend's kid.

440
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,275
And what does he do? He gives him money?
For errands?

441
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,280
Hey, I told you,
I'm a parole officer, okay?

442
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,284
We see guys like this all the time.
He is a sicko. I feel it in my gut.

443
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,412
Will you go back inside?

444
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,540
Just tell your mom
I'm gonna be right there, okay, buddy?

445
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,542
All right. All right. All right.

446
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,630
The kid's got ADHD.
Tough to manage at times.

447
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,632
But that's what makes him vulnerable
to freaks like this.

448
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,885
Look, I apologize if I crossed a line.

449
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,137
I just noticed how hungry
Paco is all the time, you know?

450
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,931
I gave him a few dollars
to go to the store,

451
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,849
honestly, so he could
buy himself a sandwich.

452
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,935
I lend him books from time to time, too.
That's all.

453
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,605
He just seems a little neglected.

454
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,689
Are you kidding me right now?

455
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,234
I'm not saying they're unfit.
A lot of people drink.

456
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,152
-That's it! I--
-All right! All right!

457
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,780
Sorry to have taken up your time.

458
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,198
Good luck with the garden.

459
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,699
Thank you, Officer.

460
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,368
People. They're easy to fool.

461
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,953
Like these cops.

462
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,456
I'm the nice, straight-edge guy,
so there's nothin' to worry about.

463
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,792
People believe
whatever supports their worldview.

464
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,586
Unfortunately, that seems to
include you, Beck.

465
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,132
You believed you deserved Benji
and his neglect.

466
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,009
And you believe you deserve Peach
and her drama. And on and on.

467
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,179
I want to call and tell you, but I can't,

468
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,557
because there's
a traditional waiting period

469
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,643
between every goddamn communication
when you're trying to date someone.

470
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,812
I hate this generation.

471
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,596
Thank you.

472
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,434
Thanks for staying with me.

473
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,021
Honestly, I don't know
what I would've done without you.

474
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,940
You can always count on me.

475
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,692
Thanks.

476
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,655
So, what do you think about Joe?

477
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,327
Uh... Yeah, you know, I like him.

478
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,621
I think I might really like him.

479
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,291
I mean, I wasn't sure if I was ready
to get involved, but maybe...

480
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,793
Okay, you can't be serious.

481
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,087
I mean, the guy works at a bookstore.

482
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,176
Beck. Look, I know you.

483
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,553
You don't want to spend
your fifth anniversary

484
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,264
going dutch at Katz's Deli.

485
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,393
You need someone to take care of you.

486
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,981
So you can write, be free, happy.

487
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,320
Not someone like Joe
and his financial limitations.

488
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,446
That is not fair.

489
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,865
Nobody pays me to be fair.

490
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,829
What do you say we get a bite to eat?
'Cause I'm starving.

491
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,622
I think I better skip it.

492
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,960
I should really get home.
Glad you're feeling better.

493
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,688
Oh, no, no, no. Not now.

494
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,523
Okay, Beck, all right.

495
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,442
Hey. How's the patient?

496
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,028
Better. Thanks for the ride.

497
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,239
The doctor said it was good
that we came when we did.

498
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,283
Oh, yeah?

499
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,788
Why don't you meet me back at my place?
Maybe we can pick up where we left off?

500
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,039
What about Peach?

501
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,542
-What about her?
-Where is she now?

502
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,961
Indochine. It's her comfort food.

503
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,758
Perfect. Peach is gulping steamed
Chilean sea bass down her scrawny gullet,

504
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,343
and I'm about to get caught.

505
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,637
So, what do you think?

506
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,556
I think you complain
about not being able to write,

507
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,975
but then you, you know, drop everything
for some medical emergency,

508
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,436
which, by the way, many believe
to be psychosomatic in origin.

509
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,023
I meant about you coming over.

510
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,942
I wish I could. I really wish I could,

511
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,070
but I'm just really busy right now,
so, in fact, I should go.

512
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,197
Look, I know Peach showing up
was bad timing,

513
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,700
but I wasn't exactly writing
when she showed up.

514
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,578
-No, I know.
-Pro tip of the day.

515
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,914
Screen your calls
when you're trying to burn a body,

516
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,708
because it turns out, things slip out
that you didn't actually want to say.

517
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,295
...but, you know, you're sending
some mixed messages, right?

518
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,630
What is that supposed to mean?

519
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,050
I'm trying to do what you want,
but I can't tell what that is.

520
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,385
Like, build you a bed,
be with you on the bed,

521
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,470
drop you down the block

522
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,721
because your friend is asking,
and not very...

523
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,014
Seriously, Joe, shut up.

524
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,933
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

525
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,144
But...

526
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,273
Hey! How's it going?

527
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,901
Good. That's one hell of a bonfire.

528
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,197
Yeah. What can I say?
I went a little crazy.

529
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,033
You know,
you're welcome to join if you like.

530
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,701
Please say no. Please say no.

531
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,453
That would be great.

532
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,918
But we need to get back to the car
before it gets any darker. Good luck.

533
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,712
-Yeah, have a good one.
-You, too.

534
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,889
I believe in love at first sight.
I had it with you, Beck.

535
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,602
And maybe, just maybe,
I destroyed it just as fast

536
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,479
in the space of a single phone call.

537
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,692
Was all this for nothing?

538
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,740
How may we describe
the joy of the king and queen

539
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,409
when they saw their daughter...

540
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,495
I've been calling you, Beck.

541
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,289
But straight to voicemail.

542
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,291
Worst three words in the English language.

543
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,003
I wonder what our kids would've been like.

544
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,463
They'd have grown up reading,
not glued to iPads.

545
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,923
And we definitely wouldn't have named them

546
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,884
things like Gulliver, or Blaze
or Mysti with an "I."

547
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,679
We would've crushed this. Together.

548
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,099
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

549
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,268
Call me back, Beck.

550
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,478
The end.

551
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,618
I don't mean this
to blow smoke up your ass or anything,

552
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:02,915
but your writing makes me think
that Raymond Carver has been reincarnated.

553
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,293
That is so kind of you
to say, Tomas.

554
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,254
I was born in '88, the year he died,

555
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,716
so weirdly enough, you're not
the first person to have said that.

556
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,261
Again, great work, Blythe.
Excited to see what's next.

557
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,514
Beck, we weren't expecting you.
You didn't send along pages.

558
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,477
I know. I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry I'm late, it's just...

559
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,772
I wrote them, but they sounded super emo.

560
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,317
So I ripped them up and started over,
and I lost track of time.

561
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,697
But this feels like me
and what I want to say.

562
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,826
It's only one page, but...

563
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,745
That isn't really enough
for us to critique.

564
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,917
Are we supposed to read it now?
In front of you? That's kind of awkward.

565
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,251
If that's the case,
I should warn you,

566
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,755
I have this facial autism thing
where I can't hide what I'm thinking.

567
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,717
Let's just reschedule your review
for another time.

568
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,118
Beck?

569
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,455
Hey.

570
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,085
Uh, okay, so I hate to admit it,
but you were right.

571
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,294
A little bit.

572
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,674
I will do anything for my friends.
And do I hide behind them? Yeah.

573
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,009
And do I use them as an excuse
not to write?

574
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,680
Honestly, I'd use anything
as an excuse not to write because...

575
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,683
Okay, I'm afraid I might fail.

576
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,436
I'm one terrible page away from confirming
I'm the worst writer in history.

577
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,065
All of that to say,
if I'm sending mixed messages,

578
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,777
it's because I don't know who I am.

579
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,405
So how am I supposed to know what I want?

580
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:02,577
And I know I sound super gross,
like, so, I don't know, millennial.

581
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,370
Don't say anything.

582
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,039
In this moment, you are everything.

583
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:12,545
Here's the thing. If you know who you are,
it's not like you share it.

584
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:17,383
I mean, you're a nice guy
with the "you're remarkable" stuff,

585
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,802
and feelings guy
with the "write what moves you,"

586
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,598
but then, you try and go down on me
in the middle of a furniture store.

587
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,641
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were hiding something.

588
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,812
For God's sakes,
why are you holding a Pendleton blanket?

589
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,860
I've never even seen your place,

590
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,905
and you never talk
about any of your friends.

591
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,364
I mean, who are you?

592
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,453
Okay, that was too much.

593
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,331
Um... It sounded better in my head.

594
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,749
I want to show you something.

595
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,384
You want to know me, Beck?

596
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,059
I'll show you exactly who I am.

597
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,913
This is where we keep the rarest books.

598
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,708
The collectibles. First editions.

599
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:43,094
It's paper, cloth, leather, paste.
It's all vulnerable.

600
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,890
All sensitive to light,
humidity, temperature.

601
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,731
That's why they need to be in here.

602
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,318
To protect them.

603
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,449
I can take you to my apartment.
Any time you want.

604
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,540
I want you to meet my friends. I do.
But this...

605
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,464
this right here, is the most
important place in the world to me.

606
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,551
As weird as it sounds.

607
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,765
These books are more alive,

608
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:35,062
more worthy than most people I know.

609
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,942
You want to know who I am? This is it.

610
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,759
There you are.

611
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,512
That's it. I am officially
out of the Tinder business.

612
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,557
-Bravo, honey.
-I just...

613
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,476
I feel like this is a good step, you know?

614
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,728
Like, this is good for me.

615
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,356
Joe is good for me.

616
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,982
Whatever you need, Becks.

617
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,820
I'm just saying,
and I mean this, honestly...

618
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,699
Maybe a simple life isn't so bad.
Maybe it's what you need.

619
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,701
Maybe I should be looking for that.

620
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,537
Joe isn't simple. He's different.

621
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,123
Complicated.

622
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,378
That's funny. There's a book missing.

623
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,464
Really? What book is that?

624
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,259
Ozma of Oz. No, it was just here.

625
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,887
Joe was looking at it at my party.

626
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,138
I'm sure it'll turn up.

627
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,944
You've deleted Tinder.

628
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,030
And now you've called
and asked me to come over.

629
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,576
My faith in our epic love story
is officially restored.

630
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
I'm sorry, Joe. I was so stupid.

631
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,501
I left your list on my bed,
and Ron found it. I'm sorry.

632
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,670
You're not stupid. It's not your fault.

633
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,588
I tried to explain, but...

634
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,465
It's not your fault.

635
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,636
Guys like Ron are bullies.

636
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,264
We just need to stay
one step ahead of them.

637
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,060
Like the Musketeers. Always one step ahead
of the Cardinal, right?

638
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,478
Hmm.

639
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,605
"One for all."

640
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,357
"And all for one."

641
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,610
Paco!

642
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,737
Get inside.

643
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,032
I can smell the bourbon from here.

644
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,537
I told you. Leave the kid alone.

645
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,833
Look, you may have the cops fooled
with your bullshit tomato garden.

646
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,251
But I'm right.

647
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,795
There's something wrong with you.

648
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,382
I see it in your eyes.

649
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,312
File that away under
"future problems."

650
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,938
Knock, knock. You here yet?

651
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,981
Because tonight...

652
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,360
Tonight, I show you I'm the one.

653
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,500
You can make me pancakes later.

654
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,670
Did you just...
