1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,052
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
Everyone just calls me Beck.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,556
And you're Joe...

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,557
Goldberg.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,434
A guy needs to protect himself.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,145
And your name
was a glorious place to start.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,606
The next thing our little friend
the Internet gave me was your address.

8
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,110
Professor Leahy.

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,070
Professor Obvious wants
to sleep with you.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,782
Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the queen.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,908
How broke are you?

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,995
Benjamin J. Ashby.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,663
Greenwich-born, boarding-school bred.

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,999
God, you make me insane.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,797
I think I know you.

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,341
Oh, the... Right.
Of course.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,342
You're smart.

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,805
Except in the ways you are really not.
Like not locking your phone.

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,099
-...we could get a drink sometime?
-Sure.

20
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,393
What you really need
is someone to save you.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,228
Man, I'm thinking maybe...

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,732
- Whatever you think I did...
- I can help, Beck.

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,900
...you got the wrong guy.

24
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,859
Let me help you.

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,490
Tonight's the night, Beck.

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,783
Our first date.

27
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,036
It just feels right. Right?

28
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,918
I'm looking forward to it.

29
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,129
And I think, obvious hangover aside,
you are, too.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,132
But I've read people wrong in the past.

31
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,760
One day, I'll tell you about Candace.

32
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,847
Every red flag I was blind to.
How destroyed I was.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,683
What can I say? We all have baggage.

34
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,770
But I feel like
I'm dealing with it the right way.

35
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,314
I'm not bothering you, just checking in.

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,115
Hanging with you like this is, admittedly,
honing skills I never knew I'd need.

37
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,742
But hey, handy.

38
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,250
You can't afford new clothes,
but let's be real,

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,710
you'd look perfect in a potato sack.

40
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:15,051
Not a criticism, God knows I am, too,
but you seem distracted.

41
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,014
Of course, a new phone.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,725
Not sure how you went 24 hours
without one.

43
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,645
As you activate your new friend there,

44
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,565
I know you think you're also
deactivating your old one.

45
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,650
But here's where you're wrong.

46
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,320
Your old phone, which I have,
is still logged into the cloud.

47
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,327
And that means I'm still logged into you.

48
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,540
Sci-fi movies are so wrong.
Technology is our friend.

49
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,251
You've reached Benji.
Leave some love. Namaste.

50
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,714
Hey. Look, you haven't texted back.
Just let me know you're okay, okay?

51
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,342
That's all I ask.
This is really annoying, Benji.

52
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,514
It is annoying.

53
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,683
You're not thinking about us,
you're thinking about him.

54
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,312
I kind of thought
I took care of that for you, Beck.

55
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,689
Wanna start off the class
this morning?

56
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,607
Sure.

57
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,902
Good. My last TA was like
a little mouse, afraid of public speaking.

58
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,487
- It's my job.
- Well, lucky us, you're good at it.

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,531
So, we're still on for tomorrow?
Drinks, poetry?

60
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,575
Nothing, if not up for both of those.

61
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,504
They came for the big day.
Want me to move 'em down to the basement?

62
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,965
No, I'll do that.
Just get started on the window display.

63
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,927
Hey, I was thinking about making cookies
for hashtag, release day.

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,888
Amanda Chantal Bacon has a dope recipe
in Moon Juice Cookbook:

65
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,057
Cook Cosmically
for Body, Beauty, and Consciousness.

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,808
- Kill me.
- Sounds great, Ethan.

67
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,644
Oh, and, uh, that kid is back.

68
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,561
Paco?

69
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,818
Hey, speed-reader.

70
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,571
-Hi, Joe.
-What're you reading?

71
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,991
This book about werewolves the girls
in my class won't stop talking about.

72
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,369
It's more about love stuff
than werewolf stuff.

73
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,831
There's... It should be right up here.

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,501
Uh, yeah, it's right here. Here, try this.

75
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,922
Frankenstein?

76
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,258
Yeah, the monster is really cool
and scary,

77
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,718
but also not really the monster.

78
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,720
What does that mean?

79
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,516
Just read it, you can tell me.
Ethan's got snacks, hit him up.

80
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,453
Let me the hell out of here!

81
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,163
Now!

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,500
Settle down, Benji. Let's talk.

83
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,218
Okay, granted, I didn't think...

84
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,595
...too far ahead
when I swung that mallet.

85
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,473
I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison.

86
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,767
The kind you know is bad,
but can't stop taking.

87
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,186
So I did what I had to do
to help you, Beck.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,274
And now there is an adult human male
in the basement of this bookstore.

89
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,483
Somebody!

90
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,401
The basement's soundproof.

91
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,447
The owner loved to read in peace
down here. I'm sorry.

92
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,327
I told you, I don't know who you are.
I don't know why I'm here. I swear.

93
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,039
Confession: I have no idea
what to do with him now.

94
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,582
I'm gonna give you
my family lawyer's number.

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,167
He'll get you paid.

96
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,793
Of course he thinks I want money.

97
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,670
You know who my father is?

98
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,673
Benjamin Ashby II, hedge fund manager?

99
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,134
We have a jet.
We'll send you anywhere in the world.

100
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,763
Best case, that's somewhere
far away from you, Beck.

101
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,726
Worst case, that ends with prison time.
Not an option.

102
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,106
It's a poppy seed bagel. Extra schmear.

103
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,568
Go to hell. I don't eat gluten.

104
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,739
It's an allergy, okay? That shit is real.

105
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,742
Gluten, dairy...
If I ate a peanut, I could die.

106
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,119
Oh, well, gosh,
whatever can I get you?

107
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:15,083
Just, like, a bare burger
wrapped in chard. Or I could do sushi.

108
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,627
- Sushi?
- My diet is limited.

109
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,212
Please?

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,466
Whoever you are, you're not a killer.

111
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,636
Oh, how I wish I was.
This'd be much less complicated.

112
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:32,725
Let me out of here.
I won't say anything to anyone.

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,811
He doesn't even know my name.
I can figure this out.

114
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,064
I'm claustrophobic. My blood sugar's low.

115
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,821
Is this sugar?

116
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,948
I found it in your wallet,

117
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,326
along with three bars of Xanax, Adderall,
half a sheet of, uh, acid, is it?

118
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,162
Whatever. It's not even for me.
I network. I own a business.

119
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,664
That's right. Home Soda.

120
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,791
It's artisanal. It's gonna blow up.

121
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,875
Is it?

122
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,336
Do your investors know you do heroin?

123
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,798
Or, uh, your father?
How about your girlfriend?

124
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,050
I don't have a girlfriend.

125
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,389
Oh, shit!

126
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,517
That's where I know you from.

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,523
You were in the cab! Beck's cab!

128
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,110
She, uh... She said your name.
It's Jimmy. No.

129
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,863
This is Joe. He literally saved my life.

130
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,072
It's Joe!

131
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,533
Now, that's a complication.

132
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,744
Do not tell me that you're doing this
because of Beck.

133
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,373
She's not my girlfriend.
You can have her. Take her.

134
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,376
Careful, Benji. Not winning any points.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,088
If you knew her,
you would not be putting me in a cage

136
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,800
and ruining your life
over Guinevere goddamn-Beck!

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,723
If you want out, you'll do what I want.

138
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,899
The days of being with a man
who doesn't value you, those are over.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,027
If we can get over the first date hump.

140
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,156
Can't help it, worried about Benji.

141
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,033
That's why it's crucial
Benji's out of your picture.

142
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,659
Please.
He's off getting shitfaced.

143
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,661
Or he's in some kind of trouble.

144
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,080
What we have right now
is just a little spark.

145
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,999
Every choice is a message.

146
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,627
With Candace,
I always felt like I was pushing.

147
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,589
But now I realize... Can't force it.

148
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,217
The timing. The spark.

149
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,469
So, you tell me
if you're too distracted, Beck.

150
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,137
You decide.

151
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,933
Sure. Looking forward.
Free at 6:00.

152
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,078
So, it was just one of those
cheesy diaries with a lock,

153
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,663
but I couldn't stop writing.

154
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,833
I just... I felt better having it all down
on paper, you know?

155
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,253
And then I did this little
creative writing assignment

156
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,796
and it just blew my teacher's mind.

157
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,006
She acted like it was the best thing
she'd ever read...

158
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,801
Honestly, part of me thought
this date would never come,

159
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,428
and now it feels so easy, so right.

160
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,848
This is how our story goes, Beck.

161
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,809
And here I am.

162
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,938
Sometimes you just...
You do things on instinct,

163
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,400
because you have to,
and then you scramble. You know?

164
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,402
Yeah, I kind of know.

165
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,447
I totally didn't google you, but if I did,

166
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,492
I might discover
you aren't on social media?

167
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,787
Fact: It renders you
insanely vulnerable with zero upside.

168
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,623
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I like real life.

169
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,792
And what about your job?

170
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,296
Bookstore manager
or international super-spy? Which is--

171
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,507
I mean, is that your goal, or...

172
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,722
I know I'm in a city full of people
with big, fat, neon-sign aspirations,

173
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,309
and I know it's not cool to say,
and it's not big and flashy...

174
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,521
but I love books.

175
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,900
And I want my life to be about
what I actually love.

176
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,779
Yeah, I get that.

177
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,455
Uh, sorry,
just a second. Okay?

178
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,581
Yeah, go ahead.

179
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,458
Hey.

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,548
Yeah, I know it's serious, Peach.
I'm the one who told you I was worried.

181
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
Okay, yes, I'm coming.

182
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,309
I'm sorry, I, uh... I have to go.
This friend, he just...

183
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,897
Apparently he had to go meet someone,
and never came back. It's worrying.

184
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,482
We can pick it up some other time
if you have to...

185
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,900
All right. Thank you.

186
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,152
I hope your friend is okay.

187
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,448
Thought I'd done it.
Gotten Benji out of our way.

188
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,784
Looks like I have to finish the job.

189
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,830
To figure out what to do

190
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,500
with the poster-boy
for white male privilege in the cage,

191
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,710
I need to understand who he truly is.

192
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,172
And to do that,
I need to know what he cares about.

193
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,715
This is totally unfair.

194
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,133
If I knew you were gonna quiz me,

195
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,343
I'd have put more recent books
on the list.

196
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,513
So, bottom line, you've never even read
On the Road.

197
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,390
It's very possible to read a book

198
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,892
without having to read it
in the traditional manner.

199
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,102
You can read about a book.

200
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,728
Yeah, I get it.

201
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,565
You're a fraud.

202
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,359
Give me the stupid book.

203
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,694
I'll read it right now,
you sadistic prick.

204
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,655
Anything to get me out of here.

205
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,783
I do understand
something about you now, Beck.

206
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,078
You somehow think this guy
is all you deserve.

207
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,163
You're looking
a little gray and mealy in there.

208
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah, no shit. You stole my stash!

209
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,127
I thought it wasn't for you.

210
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,047
Fine. You happy? It's mine.

211
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,382
I'm a chipper.

212
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,386
I never do it more than three days
in a row. And I'm quitting.

213
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,721
Okay. Only if you're quitting.

214
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,485
Doesn't work that way.
There's only one way.

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,117
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,539
Just one more thing.

217
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,794
Password?

218
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,844
Leanna.

219
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,889
L-E-A-N-N-A.

220
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:50,019
His phone lock is
another girl's name, Beck. Jesus Christ!

221
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,240
Well, he's been
living a frankly off-brand life

222
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,659
for a guy who markets health soda.

223
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,704
Based on the evidence,
not missing you when you're gone.

224
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,831
You don't mean anything to him.

225
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,841
Say cheese.

226
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,845
I was worried. I called his mother.
We were about to call the police.

227
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
And he's high in some random shitberg
in Massachusetts,

228
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,224
according to his geolocation.

229
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,060
Don't say geolocation.
You're not a stalker.

230
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,270
At least we know he's fine.
Just being the worst.

231
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,733
So we're all gonna go
try that new bar tonight, right? In SoHo.

232
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,318
You are such a lush.

233
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,737
Shit! I can't go. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm supposed to have drinks
with my thesis advisor.

235
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,991
- Ooh!
- Ah!

236
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,410
Ugh! Scale one to ten, how pervy?

237
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,120
He won an award for a book of poems

238
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,499
that probably has 35 references
to, like, vagina lips, so...

239
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,084
Well,
banging your professor is, like,

240
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,002
-a grad-school rite of passage.
-Is it?

241
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,963
Annika's like the Wikipedia page
for sluts.

242
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:04,343
Whatever! I banged my bio professor.
It was fine. Notably, I passed the class.

243
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,346
You know, eyes on the prize.
Ovary up, girl.

244
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,515
Beck doesn't want to "ovary up."

245
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,227
He controls my status as a TA.
He could knock me out of my housing.

246
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,896
Or, you could not figure it out
and report him.

247
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,107
I think it only works that way
in the movies.

248
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,817
Whatever. We're seeing you tomorrow.

249
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,737
My party?

250
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,449
Tomorrow's the anniversary
of my parents' divorce.

251
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,202
The party I always have
to distract myself.

252
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
Of course, sorry. I'm coming.

253
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,046
One more line, man. Come on.

254
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,425
Just tell me your plan,
and I will help you.

255
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,010
Where is she right now?

256
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,762
She's partying her face off
with Lynn and Annika, right?

257
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,181
Actually, she's about to
meet her thesis advisor, but...

258
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,893
glad to hear you take her seriously.

259
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,354
See, this is what I'm telling you.

260
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,442
You see this hardworking writer-chick.

261
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,985
How could you not?

262
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,530
She's branded the living shit
out of herself across the Internet.

263
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,034
I want you to know,
if I wasn't about to be late to see you,

264
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,662
I would beat this guy bloody
for the way he talks about you.

265
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,041
I'm telling you, this is her thing.

266
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,753
Right now, she's got on red lipstick,

267
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:26,508
and she's getting ready
to work her professor hard for that A.

268
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,761
I'll see you later, Benji.

269
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,933
Hey. Come back. I'm hungry.

270
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,363
There's a directness.
That's what's special about your work.

271
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,949
So if it's not direct to the bone, cut it.

272
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:55,871
Thanks, that's, um, really helpful.
And coming from you, it means a lot.

273
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,291
A lot of people
find a direct woman irresistible.

274
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,503
You should lean into that
in your life, as well.

275
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,673
Yeah. Um, easier said than done.

276
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,802
Well, you can always practice on me.
I'm safe.

277
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,889
You really have
nothing to be nervous about.

278
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,395
The world is your bright red apple.

279
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,606
You think he writes these lines
in advance? Like a poem?

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,778
I wish I had your confidence.

281
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:33,325
Putting your work out into the world
is a service.

282
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,202
I'll try and remember that.

283
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,162
I wouldn't tell you
if you weren't talented.

284
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,373
I'm happy to share all my secrets.

285
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,919
So, Beck, maybe it's time to acknowledge
what there is here.

286
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,640
Don't touch me.
That's not sexy, it's repulsive.

287
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,023
-Sorry, but this is not--
-You invited me to.

288
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,484
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you flirt brazenly.

289
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,738
You wear clothes so sheer,
I can see your nipples.

290
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,698
-What do you call that?
-That's crazy.

291
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,951
If you want to stay on the safe side
of the plausible deniability zone,

292
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
cover your tits,

293
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,917
stop the blowjob eyes and write better.

294
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,838
I like you,
but clearly you're overworked.

295
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,092
It's only right to release you
from the TA position.

296
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,218
No, no, please.

297
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,219
Get some rest.

298
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,894
You're right to be angry.
Some things can't just be allowed to be.

299
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,772
Something has to be done
about someone like him.

300
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,121
Hello?

301
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,041
Hey, where are you?

302
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,087
I'm in the Village.
Maybe we can, uh, finish our talk?

303
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,590
Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

304
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,314
Are you staring at my lipstick?

305
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,192
No, no. No, I'm not. I'm not.
No, it's just different.

306
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:35,447
I just... I wanted to try something new,
but you're right, it's not really me.

307
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,741
So, why did you call me?

308
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,452
I don't know. Spontaneous impulse.

309
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,621
It's okay.
You'll learn you can tell me anything.

310
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,374
We cut it short last time because
a friend of yours was missing, right?

311
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,460
Oh, God, he's fine. He's just an idiot.

312
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,753
Agree with you there.

313
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,672
But you want to keep it light.
I can do that.

314
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,590
Okay.
This couple here, coming in the door...

315
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,010
What do you think? First date?

316
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,056
Third. She's not sure
she wants to seal the deal.

317
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,183
Hmm.

318
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,602
And those two?

319
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,895
-Where?
-There.

320
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,689
Brink of divorce.

321
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,816
Oh. That's cold.

322
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,026
Okay.

323
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,867
-Oh, that's easy.
-That's us in 30 years.

324
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,328
And that was way too much.

325
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,540
I love that.

326
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
Wow. You're in super good shape
for an old guy.

327
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,423
Thank you! And you,
if I may say, are hot as ever.

328
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,967
But in a dignified, age-appropriate way.

329
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,928
It's all the yoga. It keeps me young.

330
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:48,645
To be honest, Joe,
I'm so happy that you could come tonight.

331
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,317
It's been the worst day.
My thesis advisor, he made a pass at me.

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,985
Huh. You're kidding.

333
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,528
The most embarrassing part is,

334
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,323
I actually thought
he believed in me and my work.

335
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,491
This isn't your fault.

336
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,493
Dumb shit like this happens all the time.

337
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,625
Starting to think I'm some kind of magnet
for dudes with serious issues.

338
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,338
So what are you gonna do?
About your thesis advisor.

339
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,924
I don't know. Get through it.

340
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,761
I believe in you.

341
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,393
Hey, do you want to come to a party
with me tomorrow?

342
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,229
Already booking our next date?

343
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,607
It's at a friend, Peach Salinger's.

344
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,192
Like J.D. Salinger?

345
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,819
-I mean, yes.
-Whoa.

346
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,947
-But she doesn't like to talk about it...
-Wow.

347
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,989
...and she's a sweetheart.

348
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,533
Her family's just a little... You know?

349
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,535
Whose isn't?

350
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,549
Mmm. I like yours better.

351
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,139
Let us give thanks to our lord,
Stephen King, who bestoweth books

352
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,726
so that our bookstores
in third-dimensional locations may live.

353
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,562
It's cool how you get in
the monster's POV.

354
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,483
You understand why he does stuff,
almost like it's, um...

355
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,610
Justified?

356
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,489
Yeah. But then it's weird 'cause he's bad,
but not all bad.

357
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,782
Quick Twitter break from Benj.

358
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,577
I mean, maybe Dr. Frankenstein's
the bad one for even making him, right?

359
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
Well, I think it's open
to your interpretation.

360
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,167
We ready?

361
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,548
Let's do it, then.
Release the kraken! Hey!

362
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,216
Come on in. Hey, good morning.

363
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,219
Cookies, homemade. Not just for me.
Get a book.

364
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,598
Thank you so much.
Your receipt is in the book.

365
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,558
Thank you so much.

366
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,101
Whoa. We need another box already.

367
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,811
Ethan, could you watch the register
for a second?

368
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,146
Kid ran down to the basement to get it.

369
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,940
-What? No.
-Yeah. I saw him grab your key.

370
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,318
Paco!

371
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,122
Paco!

372
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,000
What did I say?

373
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,586
-I'm sorry.
-I told you not to come down here.

374
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,088
-I just wanted to grab a book.
-Don't be an idiot.

375
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,549
-Why would you do that? Why?
-I'm sorry.

376
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,857
So, what happened
with you and Professor Vag-lips?

377
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,360
Let's just say I better find a better job,
or some kind of housing, or...

378
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,571
I don't know.

379
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,116
Okay, enough of this shit.

380
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,247
Peach, no, I can't...
I can't accept it. Stop.

381
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,250
Look, it's just first,
last and a deposit, okay?

382
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,091
Don't be so noble, okay?
Just take the check and stop stressing.

383
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,008
Here.

384
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:19,272
Jesus Christ! If you want to kill me,
what the hell are you waiting for?

385
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,193
Why would I want to kill him?
Who wants to kill people?

386
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,030
Three cups. One is your brand, Home Soda.

387
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,532
It's the best, right?

388
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,535
So prove it. Tell me which one it is.

389
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,537
If I get this right, I get a fix?

390
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,830
If you get this right...

391
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,208
I'll let you out.

392
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,350
-I need a palate cleanser.
-Cup two.

393
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,150
Three.

394
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
One, two, or three?

395
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,037
I don't know.

396
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,210
Wait! None of them, okay?

397
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,839
They all taste like stale,
cheap drugstore soda. They're not mine.

398
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,384
They're all yours.

399
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,886
That's bullshit!

400
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,387
Home Soda is, obviously.

401
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:40,020
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
You psychopath!

402
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,238
Fine. You win! I lose!

403
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:56,536
We all lose, 'cause what am I gonna do
with this lying sack of shit, Beck?

404
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,538
You want Beck, right?

405
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:05,837
Let's be clear. She does not want to be
with a guy like you.

406
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,340
I can help you.

407
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,677
No, actually, she invited me
to a party tonight. To Peach Salinger's.

408
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,680
A Salinger party? Uh, Joe.

409
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,643
She's taking you to add texture.

410
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,897
She wants to seem interesting.
Like she hangs out with real folk.

411
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,774
She's deep. She's an artist.

412
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,691
Truth?

413
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:32,113
Beck will always leave someone like you
for someone who can take her places.

414
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,201
We never made it to a single party 'cause
she couldn't jump on me fast enough.

415
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,664
She's playing you for a chump,
my friend.

416
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,503
So, yeah, it was really bad.

417
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,507
Basically, food poisoning is the reason
why Peach and I are friends.

418
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,801
Puke does bond you.

419
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,220
She show you her ladle?
She's got this red kitchen ladle.

420
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,722
It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank-me thing.

421
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,016
She's kinky as shit. With me.

422
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,104
Because I'm loaded.
Not you, 'cause who are you?

423
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,856
So, hopefully nothing
gastrointestinal happens,

424
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,900
but I do hope you guys like each other.

425
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,994
You want to change that, you need me.

426
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,333
Shit.

427
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,591
One look and I can tell you,
not my crowd.

428
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,096
What they are
is everything Benji claims you want to be.

429
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,308
Beckalish! Hi.

430
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,809
Hey.

431
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,145
Mwah, mwah.

432
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,271
Thank you.

433
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,523
-Is this Joseph?
-Joe.

434
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,066
Am I just texture here, Beck?

435
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,153
- Now, Joseph--
- Just Joe.

436
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,196
I'm gonna have to borrow our friend here.

437
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,325
So, uh, make yourself at home.
Everyone here is friendly.

438
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,743
Brown people don't bite.

439
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,537
Alumni.

440
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,833
Where'd you go?

441
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,209
I didn't.

442
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,380
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

443
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,479
Annika Attwater.
Rich and hashtag, carefree,

444
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,315
building a brand
as a body-positive influencer,

445
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,777
which seems to involve wearing
a lot of free stuff on Instagram.

446
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,781
Lynn Lieser.
Publicist. Hashtag, cocktail lover.

447
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,449
Daughter of a surgeon and a tech CEO.

448
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,911
Adopted. Has all the smugness,
none of the angst.

449
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,196
If you have a full set,

450
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,324
each one of them is worth
three times as much for a collector.

451
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,410
You read that one?

452
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
Just the first one.

453
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,580
Typical.

454
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,712
You think I need some illiterate
working in my shop?

455
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,340
Hey!

456
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,637
If you want to work in this shop,
you learn the value of these books.

457
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,556
Mr. Mooney, please.

458
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,850
Everything you need is in there.

459
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,560
Let me...

460
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,687
Joseph. There you are.

461
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,485
It's Joe. Just Joe.
This is a lovely collection, Peaches.

462
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,865
It's Peach. And, I mean, you've probably
read more of these books than I have.

463
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,827
A good salesman
has to know his product, right?

464
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,791
So, you met Beck at a bookshop, right?

465
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,709
That's right.

466
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,380
Only in New York.
And then you just happened to meet again.

467
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,383
Casual tone, detective eyes.

468
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,635
Well, it's lucky we did.

469
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,971
She was on the tracks,
at the time.

470
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,433
So I heard. God! Thank goodness for you.

471
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:33,688
I mean, being in Greenpoint of all places,
at the very right moment.

472
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,945
Oh! It's time for the toast.

473
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,630
So in the time I was in there,
you attract Benji 2.0?

474
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,383
Peach looks thrilled.
Are you thrilled?

475
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,219
What do you want?

476
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,440
So which Beck are you?

477
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,527
The one I see or the one Benji does?

478
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:31,287
Hey, stranger. How you holding up?
Having fun?

479
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,418
Beck...

480
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,507
Why did you bring me here?

481
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,637
I don't know. I thought it could be fun?

482
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,641
I don't think I have a lot in common
with your other friends.

483
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,728
I like that about you.

484
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,318
I always think I'm gonna
love these things, yet somehow never do.

485
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,404
Then why did we come?

486
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,573
It's been this way since Brown.

487
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:11,786
It just feels like I'm getting sucked in,
and I could just be me,

488
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,540
yet that somehow never feels
quite good enough.

489
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,586
You know, I stole this dress.
To fit in. Which is pathetic.

490
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,712
I don't know about that.

491
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,173
Not as pathetic as the fact that
Peach wrote me a check to keep me afloat,

492
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,051
which I don't want to cash,
but now I have to.

493
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,640
Look, if you're not one of them,

494
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,519
it's just 'cause stuff didn't
just get handed to you.

495
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,938
-It didn't.
-Right, and when it's like that,

496
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,108
sometimes, to survive...

497
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,322
you have to show some teeth.

498
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,868
And I'm guessing that
yours are pretty sharp.

499
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,214
I'm glad we met. Glad we're friends.

500
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,509
For the love of Christ.

501
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,934
- Joe?
- I know that voice.

502
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,477
Joe Goldberg?

503
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,397
Maddie Johnson. I'm Candace's friend.

504
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,817
Great. Little soon for you
to hear this, Beck, but here we go.

505
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,570
Wow, Maddie, that's crazy.
It's so good to see you.

506
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,781
-Um, this is Beck.
-Hi.

507
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,740
Hey.

508
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,495
So, I heard about you and Candace.

509
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,413
You know, I thought we were pretty happy,

510
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,207
but she thought
she could be happier with...

511
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,043
some guy in Rome, so...
You know, I get it.

512
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,962
She's following her bliss.

513
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,839
It's just how she left so suddenly...

514
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,718
I mean, we were all kind of hurt.

515
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,430
Would you excuse us? My Uber's here.
It was nice to meet you.

516
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,848
I'm sorry. It was good to see you, Maddie.

517
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,231
I just felt like that needed to be over.

518
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,275
Let's get you home.

519
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,491
...be here for Paco.

520
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,202
What could he possibly
need from me...

521
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,663
He needs someone
who isn't drunk, Ron.

522
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,998
How about that?

523
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,915
Geez!

524
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,419
What the hell is wrong with you?
Punching a wall?

525
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,296
You think wrecking the place
is gonna solve our problems?

526
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,429
-It's okay.
-It's not okay to yell.

528
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,264
Grown-ups do it all the time.

529
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,057
Grown-ups are assholes.

530
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,061
Some people used to yell at me, too,
you know.

531
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,190
And I don't want to be like them.

532
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,693
I got you something.

533
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,998
I can't take this in the house.

534
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,876
Ron.

535
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,924
So, all the bathrooms in the building
have the same kind of ceiling.

536
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,718
So, go in the bathroom.

537
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,889
The ceiling tiles around the vent
move if you push them.

538
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:23,186
So you push one, pop the book in there,
slide it closed.

539
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,564
Like a secret hiding place.

540
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,149
Cool.

541
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,986
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

542
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,281
Have a good night, pal.

543
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,912
If you want it, it's here.

544
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,721
You are not responsible
for my feelings, I am.

545
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:04,018
But for the record, I feel like congealed,
day-old egg rolls right about now.

546
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,688
What was the point of taking me
to that party?

547
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,315
Benji was right.

548
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,109
Benji!

549
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,381
Honestly, I get how he feels.

550
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,343
You left me here to die!
You left me to die!

551
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,057
Enough of this. Just kill me!

552
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,447
Hi.

553
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,700
I, uh...

554
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,663
I just... I want to ask you
to please reconsider.

555
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,459
I need the TA job. I need housing.

556
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,548
Can we, um, maybe discuss placing me
with another advisor?

557
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,593
It's the middle of the term.

558
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:25,516
I know, um, inconvenient, but it's...
it's really important.

559
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,477
I wish you the best...

560
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,523
but I really can't,
in good conscience, do that.

561
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,609
I understand.

562
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:53,127
So, I... I guess I'm realizing
I have no choice...

563
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,720
but to share this.

564
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,809
And that is...

565
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,395
Well, it can fit in one tweet.

566
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,899
A list of six women
who have a story about you.

567
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,193
Not hard to find.
Didn't take much asking around.

568
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,655
What's the term again,
harassment or misconduct?

569
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,950
Anyway, they were too scared
to come forward, but then we realized,

570
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:28,204
it's harder to dismiss seven women
with the same story.

571
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,122
That's not possible.

572
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,583
I've done nothing inappropriate.

573
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,588
You want to make yourself a public liar,
that actually would sink your career.

574
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,549
Blackmail is not something you live down.

575
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,722
You're trying to call my bluff,
but I'm not bluffing.

576
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,850
So, your call.

577
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,985
I've had a lot of time to think
in here.

578
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,907
You're right. I am a fraud.

579
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,328
I've done things worse than you.

580
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,294
And that's how I know.
Joe, you're not a killer.

581
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,092
I'm gonna tell you something,

582
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,886
and once I tell you,

583
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:30,474
I'll know your worst secret,
and you'll know mine.

584
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,894
Then you can let me go.

585
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,821
He's so shitfaced!

586
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,990
Yeah! He's gonna be a superstar!

587
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,618
Lot of interesting stuff
in Benji's nightstand. But he was right.

588
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,497
The thumb drive
is by far the most interesting.

589
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,832
It started out

590
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:59,962
your standard-issue frat hazing,
but a certain intensity kicked in.

591
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,883
Blame the coke. Or the homophobia.

592
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,427
Teach this bitch a lesson!
Teach him a lesson!

593
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,347
They all stood there, laughing.

594
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:15,436
And Benji was the worst,
because he stood there holding the camera.

595
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,146
Dumbass! Wake up, dumbass!

596
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,565
Oh, shit!

597
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:24,653
Their parents made it go away,
but Benji kept a copy of the video,

598
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,947
I assume to hold over friends' heads.

599
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,909
Instead, I get to hold it over Benji's.

600
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,245
And he doesn't deserve it, but he's right.

601
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,874
It is enough to buy his freedom.

602
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,344
Should I have changed the subject?

603
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,471
On that balcony. Tried to kiss you sooner?

604
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,224
It's not fair,
how easy it is to kill a spark.

605
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,060
It's a miracle love ever happens,
if it's not a myth.

606
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:56,977
Hi.

607
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,942
Thanks to you,
I showed that professor some teeth.

608
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,569
And?

609
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,157
What's that?

610
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,617
A "thank you" donut.

611
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,036
It worked.

612
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,121
Hmm.

613
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,873
That's good. I'm glad.
I mean, I was worried--

614
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,874
You were right.

615
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,627
And I have housing,
and can rip Peach's check up,

616
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,296
and generally live to fight another day.

617
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,715
And I wouldn't have had the guts
if you hadn't...

618
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,844
So, really, thank you.

619
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,971
All I want to do is help, Beck.

620
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,975
I mean, you saw something in me, and God,

621
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,728
not everyone gets why I'm here,
and what being a writer means.

622
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,190
It's the most... I mean,
it's the only important thing, and...

623
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,193
you helped me to not lose it.

624
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,906
Aren't you gonna look?

625
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,992
See if I guessed the right flavor?

626
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,081
No bullshit. Classic.

627
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:04,044
Even, old-school, and secretly better than
all those crazy, trying-too-hard ones.

628
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,882
It is nice to be seen.

629
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,302
It's a good guess.

630
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,265
It's good.

631
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,446
Come back here.

632
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,045
So, plain glazed a yes.

633
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,214
Noted.

634
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,676
I have to go to class.

635
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,970
Have a good class, Beck.

636
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,287
Did you get it? The video?

637
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,709
Maple latte, almond milk, two stevia.
Did I get that right?

638
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,798
Yeah. Yeah, I saw the video.

639
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,301
Yes, yes, yes!

640
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,268
Oh!
Mutually assured destruction.

641
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,353
Let's talk about something first, though.

642
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,941
What you said about Beck
basically being a gold digger?

643
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,902
I was just being honest, that's all.

644
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,071
What you are is wrong.

645
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,700
I'd go so far as to say
you create the problem

646
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,787
when you assume this stuff,
when you treat her like trash.

647
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:09,420
You cast her in a role that isn't her,
and you trap her in it.

648
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,423
Bro, I'm done with her!

649
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,924
Say I can trust you.

650
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,971
I've got the video, right?
I mean, a solid maybe.

651
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,933
The thing is, that doesn't make up
for the damage you've done.

652
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,934
I'm sorry.

653
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,563
If it was between me and you, Benji,
honestly, I would roll the dice.

654
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,606
I would.

655
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,025
Like you said, I'm not a killer...

656
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:38,449
but this is about her.

657
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,409
I'm telling you.

658
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,623
I'm scared. I'm very scared
of what you would do to her.

659
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,794
Maple almond latte...

660
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,676
two stevia, two tablespoons of peanut oil.

661
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,724
Could've gone either way.

662
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,226
He's lied about so many things.

663
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,063
Who knew? The peanut allergy was real.

664
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,663
I guess Benji's gonna die an honest man.
