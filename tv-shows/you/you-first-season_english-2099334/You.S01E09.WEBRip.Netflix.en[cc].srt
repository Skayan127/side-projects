1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,219
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,014
The only good thing
in my life right now is therapy.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,433
It's a bit troubling when
your partner hides something from you.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,602
-Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?
-I hear you, Paul.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,146
-Are you sleeping with him?
-Who?

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,230
Your therapist.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,442
No! I am not sleeping with him.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,069
If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,237
We're over.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,614
Karen is perfect.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,074
I've never wanted anything more.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,452
Except you, Beck.

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,829
-It's over.
-You're dumping me.

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,250
Joe Goldberg?
I heard about you and Candace.

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,586
She thought she could be happier
with some guy in Rome.

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,547
It's just how she left so suddenly...

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,800
Are you gonna leave Beck alone?
Or will she end up like me?

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,095
-He never talks about Candace.
-You must sleep deeper than I do.

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,931
What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,475
Or worse.

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,728
Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,325
Candace.

23
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,996
Candace.

24
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,418
Candace!

25
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,340
Candace!

26
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,179
I'm sorry!

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,057
I'm sorry!

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,559
Candace!

29
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,852
Candace!

30
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,824
Thank God you had
that third glass of pinot.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,744
I want to wake you so you can hold me.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,581
But then you might ask
what I've dreamt about.

33
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,250
And it doesn't matter, Beck.

34
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,503
What matters is what's real. This.

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,838
Us.

36
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,437
Goddess of war. Seven letters.
Athena?

37
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,523
Oh, no, that's six.

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:17,030
Ishtar? No. No, no, no.
Freyja. What about Freyja? Freyja?

39
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,282
Or you could try seven letters.

40
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,868
Okay, here. Can I see it?

41
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,624
Yeah, okay...

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh!

43
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:34,464
Sekhmet. Yeah. S-E-K-H...

44
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,466
No, she's an Egyptian goddess. What?

45
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,301
Nothing. I just...

46
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,303
I like watching you reach into
your mind palace

47
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,138
for random bits of information.

48
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,225
I like it when you say
things like "mind palace."

49
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,352
In mine, by the way, you're the queen.

50
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,520
-Oh, wow!
-Yeah, right?

51
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,191
I missed this. Our routine.

52
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,610
Unless, of course, this is what you do
with all your girlfriends.

53
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,528
All of them. The whole harem.

54
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,073
How many have there been, by the way?

55
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,493
Girlfriends? Really? Haven't we done this?

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,079
I mean, besides Karen,
you've only told me about one.

57
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,748
What's her name,
who went to, like, Europe?

58
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,833
God, what was her name?

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,171
You know her name because you heard
me calling it last night, didn't you?

60
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,090
Now you want to know more.
Of course you do.

61
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,175
Why would I call another woman's name
in my sleep?

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,010
Oh, Candace, right?

63
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,512
Is this a problem?

64
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,222
-Yeah.
-She still in France or wherever?

65
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,808
Uh, Italy. And I don't know.
I don't really care.

66
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,768
Well, why did you guys break up?

67
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,019
This is a problem.

68
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,607
Because she dumped me.
Because we were thoroughly incompatible.

69
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,192
The night you pulled me
from the train tracks,

70
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,112
you said you went chasing a girl.
Was that her?

71
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,947
Yeah, and it was really dumb of me.

72
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:46,869
The truth is, some people seem to function
to show you what isn't right for you.

73
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,954
And others...

74
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,250
show you exactly what is.

75
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,796
Saved for now. But I know you.

76
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,091
You won't stop asking questions
until I do something about this

77
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,635
and stop dreaming about Candace.

78
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,972
How do you exorcise someone?

79
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,099
A shaman? A hypnotist?

80
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,893
We can't sleep another night
with a ghost in our bed.

81
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,480
Hey, I forgot.
I have to run payroll up to Mooney today.

82
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,318
So I'm gonna have to rain check on lunch
with the girls. Is that all right?

83
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,486
-Yeah, that's fine.
-Okay, great.

84
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,702
Don't lie to me, babe!

85
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,746
I know you got the messages.

86
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,581
Please, just meet with me. Hear me out.

87
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,084
Apparently, the Doc's got
lady problems of his own.

88
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,715
Sorry about that, Paul.

89
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,093
Is everything okay?

90
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,388
-With--
-Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,559
So, uh... you've been having these dreams.
When did they start?

92
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,312
Uh, just right after Renaldo
and I broke up.

93
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,774
Right. And you broke up with Renaldo
because he cheated on you.

94
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:02,195
So now you're having dreams of your
previous ex in the arms of another man.

95
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,114
But it makes sense losing Renaldo
would kick all that back up, right?

96
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,949
But Renaldo wasn't cheating,
as it turns out.

97
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,660
In fact, we're back together now,
and things are better than ever.

98
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,539
Okay. So you wanna know
why the dreams haven't stopped?

99
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,624
Exactly.

100
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,210
Can you think of why
you don't want to face your ex?

101
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,961
I don't think I understand the question.

102
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,547
Well, in your dream,
you say you're trying to reach him.

103
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,008
But you can't because
you put yourself in a cage.

104
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,762
I don't put myself in a cage.
I find myself in the cage.

105
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,473
Whose dream is this?

106
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,227
See, we are the architects
of our own dream.

107
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,814
You have some unfinished business
with your ex and you need to deal with it.

108
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,398
Trust me.

109
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,693
If you don't deal with this,
if you don't face it,

110
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,320
it will haunt you, man.

111
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,449
Uh, yes, face Candace.
I'd sooner slam my nuts in a door.

112
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,912
But anything to stop screaming her name
in my sleep.

113
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,581
Come on, asshole. I'm hungry.

114
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,753
Terry, are you kidding me?

115
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,090
Here. Here, here.

116
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,008
Can I help you out with that?

117
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,970
My hero.

118
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,305
You guys playing here tonight?

119
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah, if I don't starve to death
before then.

120
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,937
You should actually come see us play.
We put on a pretty good show.

121
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,817
-We're Heathcliff's Misery.
-Wuthering Heights?

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,112
Very good. I'm Candace.

123
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,614
Oh. Hey, I'm Joe.

124
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,700
Thanks for your help, Joe.

125
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,785
My pleasure, Candace.

126
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,957
Fucking Candace. I mean, look at her.

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,792
No wonder he's dreaming about her.

128
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,711
She's got this whole icy redhead,

129
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,506
"Follow me into this cave, Jon Snow" vibe.

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,801
Okay, if you think
I post a lot of selfies...

131
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,012
And she's not even Joe's type.

132
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,223
I thought he was only into
mildly slutty smart girls.

133
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,225
So funny.

134
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,437
I mean, honestly,
she hasn't posted in a year.

135
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,063
This account's not even active.

136
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,232
She ran off to Italy. Allegedly.

137
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,692
Why do you even care about this chick

138
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,944
if y'a'll are in mad love
and she's in Italy?

139
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,363
Well, we don't know if she even is.

140
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,617
I mean, she could secretly be here
and they could be banging.

141
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,535
Or he is still in love with her.

142
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,748
He's telling her that she's his forever
and I'm just his right now,

143
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,459
and then he feels guilty
for being with me.

144
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,586
Okay, can we talk about
what you're really doing here?

145
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,672
No. I know what you're gonna say.

146
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,635
Babe. Your career is taking off.
You're falling for a genuinely good guy.

147
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,595
And you think that there must be
something wrong.

148
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,598
Because good things must be taken away
from Guinevere Beck.

149
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,850
Yeah. Hashtag, daddy issues.

150
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,897
Oh, my God. You guys are so right.

151
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,482
Is that the guy?

152
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,029
- Yeah, it's totally the guy.
- Is he following us?

153
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,157
Hi. Hello. Hi.

154
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,452
Douchey man. Hi.

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,038
Do you want to join us?
'Cause there's room.

156
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,546
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, God, what a dick.

157
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,965
What does he think, one of us killed her?

158
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,509
What are you talking about?
Who is that guy?

159
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,429
He hasn't talked to you? Peach's family
hired him to look into her death.

160
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,515
- Like a PI?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,725
It's all her mother.
God forbid the ladies at the club

162
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
think her perfect daughter killed herself.

163
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,854
- What?
- Ugh. She was doomed.

164
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,815
Her whole family's House Slytherin.

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,027
Oh, shit.
We're gonna be late to cryo.

166
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,241
-Becks, last chance.
-I wish. I have to, um, send Blythe notes.

167
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,410
Well, have fun. Love you.

168
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,246
- Bye.
- Later.

169
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,123
- Smooches.
- Let's just...

170
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,792
-Bye.
-Bye.

171
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,018
You mean Bushnell?
Yeah, I love Candace Bushnell.

172
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,021
Although, honestly,
I can't really stand SJP.

173
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,065
You know who I mean. Joe's Candace.

174
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,359
Yeah, I just don't really
want to get into it.

175
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,944
- Why?
- Where is Joe?

176
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,240
He said he had to see Mooney
to sign payroll or something.

177
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,285
-Really?
-Yeah. Why?

178
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,870
Uh... nothing.

179
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,624
I saw you two were friends on Facebook.

180
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,294
Yeah, I'm also friends with John Oliver
and Ali Farka TourĂ©

181
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,463
and Blythe's great-aunt Siobhan
on Facebook.

182
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,797
Doesn't mean I really know them.

183
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,966
But you knew her, right?

184
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,554
Come on. It's just, for whatever reason,

185
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,556
Joe doesn't seem to want
to talk about her.

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,059
Yeah, I'd maybe respect his wishes
on this one.

187
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,646
Why? What happened?

188
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,065
He says it was nothing,

189
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,484
but clearly that's not true,
or you wouldn't be this way.

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,489
It wasn't nothing.
He was really messed up when it ended.

191
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,449
And he even disappeared for, like, a week.

192
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,244
-Where did he go?
-I don't know. Where do sad guys go?

193
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,916
But when he got back, it was same sweats
at work for, like, eight days straight.

194
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,209
Shit got dark.

195
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,838
But then he met you,
and you brought back the light.

196
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,256
Serious.

197
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,509
You make Joe happier
than I've ever seen him.

198
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,511
And that's what matters, right?

199
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,098
Just let it go.

200
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,776
Dr. Nicky was right, Beck.

201
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,612
I don't like looking back.
I don't see the point of it.

202
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,489
But if my choices are

203
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,283
stare straight at Candace,
at what happened to us,

204
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,578
or end up like lonely Dr. Desperate,
well...

205
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,749
Oh! Hey, Santa. Whatcha got there?

206
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,126
Well, that depends.

207
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,212
Have you been
naughty or nice, little girl?

208
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,839
Ho-ho-ho.

209
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,425
I'm sorry, I gotta stop that.
I... That's too gross.

210
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,386
I want to pepper-spray myself.

211
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,888
-Here.
-I thought we said no gifts.

212
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,599
Did we? I must've missed that.

213
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,984
Bunny.

214
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,027
My favorite.

215
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,156
- It's a first edition.
- Are you shitting me? Really?

216
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,950
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'll cherish it forever.

217
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,214
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever given me.

218
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,842
Thank you.

219
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:56,108
"Be with me always, take any form,
drive me mad.

220
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,695
Only do not leave me in this abyss,
where I cannot find you.

221
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,908
Oh, God, it is unutterable."

222
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,286
I thought we said no phones.

223
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,955
I'm sorry, Bunny. It's just my brother.

224
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,553
Who's Elijah?

225
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,182
-Give me my phone, Joe.
-He's not your brother. I know that.

226
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,892
Give me my phone back.

227
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,395
Is Elijah going to be there?

228
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,607
Don't start this again.
It's just business, Joe.

229
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,860
Yeah, for you it is.
But guys like this are predatory.

230
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,072
-I don't think you should go alone.
-You're not coming with me.

231
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,242
Why? So he can at least think
that he can get you into bed?

232
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,284
Exactly.

233
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,165
Yeah, I am outside.

234
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,209
Where are you?

235
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,753
Oh, I see you.

236
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,211
Mooney always told me

237
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,715
a book is far greater
than most hands it passes through.

238
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,800
Some simply aren't worthy.

239
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,389
That's why it's up to people like us.
People who believe in second chances.

240
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,493
Maddie Johnson.
I'm Candace's friend.

241
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,165
So, I heard about you and Candace.

242
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,126
Yeah. Yeah, we broke up.

243
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,921
I mean, seriously,
I heard some kind of crazy stuff...

244
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,971
The Peach I knew?

245
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,183
No way. Why it's great
you're writing the article.

246
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,852
And kudos to Jezebel for wanting
to spotlight the fact

247
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,021
that depression doesn't present
like people think.

248
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,732
- Yeah, I agree.
- Wait...

249
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,944
You were with Joe Goldberg
the night we met, right?

250
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,279
-Yes. I was, actually.
-Yeah.

251
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,449
I remember you.
God, I was wasted that night.

252
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,038
Didn't you guys have, like,
a mutual friend or something?

253
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,834
Did. Candace? She... Long story.

254
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,420
I think they dated.

255
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,255
Oh, they did.

256
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,217
But I can't say I was shocked
when it didn't work out.

257
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,594
What happened, exactly?

258
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:15,474
Uh, there were rumors she cheated on him
with the guy who signed her to her label.

259
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,644
Which, to be honest, sounds like Candace.

260
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,982
I thought they worked through it,
but then suddenly she was off to Italy.

261
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,483
Just gone.

262
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,776
You still in contact with her?

263
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,322
That's the weird thing.
She ghosted everyone she knew.

264
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,158
So, even her family? She just...

265
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,744
Well, she really only has her brother.

266
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,749
And he's got theories of his own.
But Jimmy's not exactly well.

267
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
What kind of theories?

268
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,423
Crazy ones. Like, for starters,
he thinks Candace is dead.

269
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,608
Where are you?

270
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,486
There you are.

271
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,117
Excited to announce
I've officially signed with...

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,537
-Plumchapell Records.
-Plumchapell Records.

273
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,290
World ain't ready
for me and my new rep.

274
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,299
Ah, here we go. Elijah Thornton.

275
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,643
Yo, so I said, "Diddy,
you drop that bass line in the bridge,

276
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,020
and you got yourself a hit on your hands."

277
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,022
- I know what he's talking about.
- Yo, you know that track.

278
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:49,651
- Tell me it's not all about the bridge.
- It's all about the bridge. Cheers.

279
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,196
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

280
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,122
-Hey, Elijah?
-Mmm.

281
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,624
I'm Joe.

282
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,544
Look, man, um, just send your demo
to my assistant, okay?

283
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,254
And we'll call you.

284
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,674
Do you get all of your clients
to sleep with you?

285
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,594
Or did my girlfriend
just seem like easy prey?

286
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,724
-I'm sorry. Who's your girlfriend?
-Candace Stone.

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,435
I saw you. In your car.

288
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,938
You've been texting her.
You've been harassing her nonstop.

289
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,523
I mean, is it fun for you?

290
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,317
Do you like
pushing girls around?

291
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,693
What are you talking about, man?

292
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,073
I'm sorry, okay? I had no idea.
I thought she was single.

293
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,829
Honest to God, man, I...
She never even mentioned you.

294
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,501
Okay? I'm glad you brought it up.

295
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,763
Look, man.

296
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,143
She's been on me from the second we met.

297
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,938
I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but,
you know, you gotta know who you're with.

298
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,277
She's the type, you just give her a look
and then just... spread wide open.

299
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,157
Tell you...

300
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,743
Bitches are gonna be bitches, right?

301
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,413
What the hell are you gonna do?

302
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,751
Ah.

303
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,474
Oh, shit...

304
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:50,689
Hey, man, did you, uh... Would you want?
Do you want a bump?

305
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,192
- Yeah, yeah.
- Whoa, bro!

306
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,973
- My favorite.
- It's a first edition.

307
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,935
- Are you shitting me? Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

308
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,020
I'll cherish it forever.

309
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,234
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever given me.

310
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,319
Thank you.

311
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,417
Goodbye, Candace.

312
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:12,229
Me and Jimmy.
The first man in my life. Hashtag, twins.

313
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,291
Hartley Psychiatric Center.
How can I help you?

314
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,336
Hi, uh, can I speak to Jimmy Stone?
Is he still a patient there?

315
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,672
I'm sorry, we can't release
that information.

316
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,970
Actually, I'm family. I'm his sister.

317
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,472
I've been away, abroad.
My name is Candace.

318
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,226
I should be his emergency contact.

319
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,728
One moment, please.

320
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,151
Ms. Stone, my name is Janice Ahn.

321
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,736
We tried contacting you.

322
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
Very sorry to tell you this,

323
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,824
but your brother passed away
six months ago.

324
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,666
Hey, Beck? Are you here?

325
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,673
Hey. I tried calling you earlier.

326
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:28,096
-What's up? Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

327
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,770
I need you to tell me
what happened with Candace.

328
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,396
What?

329
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,946
Okay. You heard me, right?
Well, I... I don't know.

330
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,490
I don't know why I'm having these dreams.

331
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,202
I don't care about the dreams, Joe.
I want to know what happened.

332
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,995
I want to know where she is.

333
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,872
Why? What does that even matter?

334
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,043
Because I am going crazy over here.

335
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,254
Because there's no evidence
that she was in Italy at all.

336
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,175
Evidence? What does that...
What do you mean?

337
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,718
Are you looking into her?

338
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,221
No one's heard a single word from her
since she left.

339
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,472
I mean, she went completely AWOL--

340
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,099
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
-...on social media.

341
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,185
Who moves to Italy
and doesn't post any pictures?

342
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,270
What are you talking about, "no one"?
Who are you talking to?

343
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,858
-Maddie.
-Maddie. Maddie Johnson? Why?

344
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,611
Because you won't tell me anything.
Why do you think?

345
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,659
She told me that Candace cheated on you.

346
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,911
Yeah, she did. A lot.

347
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,457
And the guy she was screwing,
he fell off a building.

348
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,543
And then Candace disappeared,

349
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,922
and then you supposedly went to Italy
to chase her, but if...

350
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,092
If she wasn't there, then...

351
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,683
And her brother...
Apparently, he thinks that--

352
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,017
He thinks Candace is dead.

353
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,396
And that I had something to do with it.

354
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,900
Do you know Jimmy was convinced
that I was a Russian spy?

355
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,364
Or did you hear about the time he tried
to attack his mother with a knife?

356
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,575
Or the six times he tried
to commit suicide?

357
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,122
Having him committed was the single most
responsible thing Candace ever did.

358
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,709
He hated her for it, and he blamed me.

359
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,004
Look, I'm gonna show you something.

360
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,262
She changed her name when she left.

361
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,821
She always talked about
starting over like that.

362
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,573
Never thought she'd do it, but...

363
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,247
Beck, she cheated on me.

364
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,919
She broke my heart.

365
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,095
Oh, my God.

366
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,266
What is wrong with me?

367
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,393
I'm so sorry, Joe.

368
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:26,107
'Cause my mind,
it goes to the darkest places sometimes.

369
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,111
If you believe that I'm capable
of something like that--

370
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,988
No, that's the thing. I don't.

371
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,034
I know in my heart that is not you.

372
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
That could never be you.

373
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,422
I did lie, though.

374
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,721
I didn't follow Candace to Italy.

375
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,641
If you wanna know where I went,
I can show you.

376
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,737
You ready?

377
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,081
Joseph. What's wrong?

378
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,628
Were you seen? Did you talk to anyone?
Did anyone know you were there?

379
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,257
All right, your clothes. Take 'em off.
Give them to me!

380
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,175
Okay, okay.

381
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,930
I killed him.

382
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,852
Listen to me, boy.
So long as you tell no one, you are fine.

383
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,772
Men, they go off to war,
kill people every day,

384
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,649
then come back
and get on with their lives.

385
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,945
Hear me? His life is over. Not yours.

386
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,739
Now, Joseph...

387
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,037
Some people deserve to die.

388
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,665
I'm sure you had your reasons.

389
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,462
Ah, Joe. Perfect timing.

390
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,089
Just finishing up supper.

391
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,009
- Bridey, this is Beck.
- Hi.

392
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,552
Nice to meet you, dear.

393
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,682
Hey, old man. This is Beck.

394
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,393
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mooney.

395
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,313
I'm Guinevere, but people call me Beck.

396
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,858
Oh, here.

397
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,575
It was a stroke. Little over a year ago.

398
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,038
I still make it up at least, what,
once a week to visit you?

399
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,166
It never gets any easier,
seeing him like this.

400
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,501
He was such a force.

401
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,170
You still are, of course.
Now, I can get a word in.

402
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,093
-Oh, sorry, Bridey.
-No worries.

403
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:09,187
He, uh, took me in
when I was just about Paco's age.

404
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,108
Taught me everything I know.
He's really my only family.

405
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,528
And it's my fault he's like this.

406
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,782
-What?
-When everything went down with Candace...

407
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,451
I was just...
I was trying to win her back.

408
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,079
Or I was too busy
feeling sorry for myself.

409
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,914
I hadn't been able to visit in a while.

410
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,584
When I found him,
he'd been lying there for two days.

411
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,133
-Joe...
-That week...

412
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,054
I was here... with him.

413
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,354
Sometimes you can't talk about something
because you feel shitty about it.

414
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,485
This wasn't your fault.

415
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,743
And you're not alone anymore, Joe.

416
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,250
You didn't let go of my hand
the entire way home.

417
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,085
It feels good.

418
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:19,174
Who knew sharing my darkest secrets
would make me feel so light?

419
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
- Emma?
- What?

420
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,772
From, uh... Emma from Brown? The fox?

421
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,524
Oh, yeah. Um...

422
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:42,197
She's thinking about moving to New York
and has a million questions.

423
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,954
-You should... You should answer.
-No. It's okay. I'll call her tomorrow.

424
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,123
It was a solid excuse at the time.

425
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,375
But I've scoured your social media

426
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,545
and you don't have a friend Emma
from Brown.

427
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,173
Sorry, Bunny. It's just my brother.

428
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,803
But you're not Candace. You're not.

429
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,223
Ah, shit.
The alarm is going off at the store.

430
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724
I gotta go.

431
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,436
Don't worry. I won't go in if there's been
a sign of forced entry.

432
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,648
Well, I could come with you
and be your backup.

433
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,067
I was an orange belt once.

434
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,237
That's all right.

435
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,407
You go on in.
You save those judo moves for later.

436
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,161
I better get in there
and shave my legs.

437
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,917
I've made a lot of mistakes, Beck.

438
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,547
Trusting my parents would come back
for me some day was a mistake.

439
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:47,971
Loving Candace. Forgetting Mooney.
Trying to help Claudia. All mistakes.

440
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,807
But what all of that has taught me?

441
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,604
Everything goes to shit
when I don't follow my instincts.

442
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,694
Get up on the fence. Don't move!

443
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,487
-Hey, come on. Be cool.
-Shut up!

444
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,990
Unlock it.

445
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,700
Ow! Ahh!

446
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,951
There we go.

447
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:19,127
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.

448
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,628
Just take whatever you want.

449
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,178
You were... for months.
He tasted you.

450
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,932
He was inside you. In the bed I built.

451
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,852
He's been defiling you.
Taking advantage of you.

452
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,979
-On your knees. Now!
-Oh, God...

453
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,068
I have a family. I can make it right.

454
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,490
Please! I have a family, man.
They don't deserve this.

455
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,951
Some people deserve to die.

456
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,788
I know in my heart that is not you.

457
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,583
That could never be you.

458
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,344
He'll get what's coming to him.

459
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,722
This, Beck, is between me and you.

460
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,945
Hey, you. About time.

461
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,618
What happened?

462
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,708
You told me I was crazy.

463
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,253
What?

464
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,799
You told me I was crazy
for even thinking it.

465
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,970
If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

466
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,391
You said that to me. Do you remember?

467
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,480
-What are you talking about?
-You know what I'm talking about.

468
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,985
There's no Emma Fox.

469
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,827
I'm only gonna ask you this once.

470
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,122
And I need the truth.

471
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:29,257
Are you, or were you ever,
fucking your therapist?

472
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,348
Answer me.

473
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,850
Answer me!

474
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,523
Yes.

475
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,402
You don't love me.
You never loved me.

476
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:53,114
Yes, I was. I did. I... I cheated.

477
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,492
But it's over now.

478
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,370
It was a lie. It was all a lie.

479
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,166
I've done nothing but dote on you.

480
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,376
-Support you.
-I know.

481
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,336
-Love you.
-I know, Joe.

482
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,464
And look at what you've done to me.

483
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,798
What I did.

484
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,802
You dig into my past. You dissect my life.

485
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,096
You paint me out
to be this monster, this...

486
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,724
Someone who could hurt people,
who could do terrible things.

487
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,770
But who is the monster here, really? Who?

488
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,777
Why?

489
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,994
Joe...

490
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,625
I've never...

491
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,464
I've never loved anyone
the way that I love you.

492
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,178
And...

493
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,809
I didn't know
what to do with that, because...

494
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,772
I didn't think that I could have it.

495
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,318
Or keep it.

496
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,283
Is that true?

497
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,541
If you love me, we have a chance.

498
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,878
Say it again.

499
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,551
I love you, Joe.

500
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,641
I love you, too.

501
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,336
No dreams.

502
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:19,010
It's the first time in weeks
there are no ghosts in our bed.

503
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,763
Because you love me, Beck.

504
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,687
Where are you going?

505
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,113
I'm just gonna get us some breakfast.
Do you have any requests?

506
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,364
Mmm...

507
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,200
-Waffles.
-Okay.

508
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,298
I love you, too, creeper.

509
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,083
Hey, stranger.

510
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,418
Hey, Beck. Joe's gone, right?

511
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,963
-You just missed him.
-Good.

512
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,465
I just wanted to give this back.

513
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,801
Still not talking to him?

514
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,680
Paco, I don't know
what went down between you guys,

515
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,683
but I know how much Joe cares about you.

516
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,309
I wish you'd give him another chance.

517
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:57,483
Just tell him sorry I had it so long.
I forgot it was still in the ceiling.

518
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,277
In the ceiling?

519
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,029
Yeah, above the toilet.

520
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,948
He said it was a good place
to hide things.

521
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,603
Oh, shit.

522
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,611
My phone!

523
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,823
-I must've dropped it in the subway.
-Oh.

524
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,659
What the hell?

525
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,633
Ugh.

526
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,427
Oh.

527
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,223
Yeah. Hey. I'm on my way, bro.

528
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,562
Ozma of Oz.
And who said anything about Joe?

529
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,107
No, no, no, no, no.

530
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,963
- Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Hey, I'm back.

531
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,980
Hey, Beck.

532
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,607
You in there?

533
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,234
Yeah! Um...

534
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,907
I'm just not feeling so great
all of a sudden.

535
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,658
Do you think it's something you ate?

536
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,913
I don't know. Good question.

537
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,915
Hmm.

538
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,252
Ahh! Shit.

539
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,762
Hey. Sorry.
I think it was the milk, actually.

540
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,057
I'm gonna go get some more.
Do you want anything?

541
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,269
-What happened?
-Oh. Nothing. It's just...

542
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,480
It's a paper cut that keeps opening up.

543
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,564
Here, let me see.

544
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,775
Beck, you're shaking.

545
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,027
I just... I get weird with blood.

546
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,112
Let me see... Ooh! Ooh!

547
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,782
-Can I get you a Band-Aid?
-No, no. It's fine. It's okay.

548
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,160
Beck, sit down. Sit down.
Let me take care of you.

549
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,687
Hey, Annika just texted.
She's totally freaking out.

550
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,856
Something about her psycho roommate.
I'm gonna go check on her, all right?

551
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,483
I'll call you later.

552
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,074
Move, Joe!

553
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,250
Don't forget this. It's yours.
Wait! Stop, stop!

554
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,710
Stop.

555
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,923
I love you, Candace.

556
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,217
I don't care about what happened
between you and Elijah.

557
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,178
And if you love me, we can get past this.

558
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,347
We can get past anything. And I...

559
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,516
I know you do. I can see it in your eyes--

560
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,185
-No, just let me go, Joe--
-Tell me you don't love me.

561
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,939
I don't! I don't love you. I never have.

562
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,615
You don't mean that. You don't...
You don't mean that. Stop it!

563
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,907
-You don't--
-You're crazy!

564
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,790
What are you gonna do about it, Joe?

565
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,917
Hmm?

566
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,916
Joe!

567
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,293
Joe!

568
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,339
Joe! Joe!
