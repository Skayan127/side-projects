1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,052
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
Everyone just calls me Beck.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,556
And you're Joe...

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,557
Goldberg.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,101
People find "the one." I believe that.

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,230
I was in love once. Candace.
She broke my heart, Beck.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,440
I should've seen the signs.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,941
But we never do.

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,777
Exhibit A. Claudia. Single parent.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,030
You think she knew Ron was a shitbag
when she fell in love?

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,032
You're a freak.

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,658
So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,785
I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,204
A guy needs to protect himself.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,373
I had to be sure you're safe.

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,626
I just need to know who you really are.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,003
- You're smart.
- Shit!

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,379
My phone!

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,131
I must've dropped it in the subway.

20
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,759
Except in the ways
you are really not.

21
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,552
Like not locking your phone.

22
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,221
And that means I'm still logged into you.

23
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,598
Maybe we could get a drink sometime?

24
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,682
Sure.

25
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,561
Hell, maybe I'm just a fool in love.
It just feels right.

26
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,230
I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve.

27
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,565
You have questionable taste in friends.

28
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,818
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

29
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,738
You fall for the wrong men.

30
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,031
Get up on the fence.

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,204
Beck, were you ever
sleeping with your therapist?

32
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,456
Yes. I cheated.

33
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,374
But it's over now.

34
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,044
What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

35
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,297
Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

36
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,424
I need you to tell me
what happened with Candace.

37
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,550
Why? What does that even matter?

38
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,386
Because there's no evidence
that she was in Italy at all.

39
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,806
No one's heard a single word from her
since she left.

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,808
I know you.

41
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,644
You won't stop asking questions
until I do something about this.

42
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,522
What the hell?

43
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,775
I'll call you later.

44
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,487
This, Beck, is between me and you.

45
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,497
Joe! Joe!

46
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
- Move!
- Mr. Mooney--

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,190
- Move!
- I was just organizing the shelf.

48
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,442
You think you knew my business
better than I do?

49
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,238
Get in! And you'll stay in
until you understand.

50
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,657
- Understand what?
- Who I am to you.

51
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,206
Joe!

52
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,596
Joe!

53
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,224
Joe!

54
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm here.

55
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,406
Joe...

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,163
why...

57
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,499
am I in here?

58
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,128
That's good.

59
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,756
Because we're talking.
We're getting it out in the open.

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,300
-You hit me!
-I'm sorry.

61
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,011
Beck, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,222
I didn't want you to freak out.

63
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,851
Joe! I am locked in a glass cage!

64
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,977
Temporarily.

65
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,316
-How long?
-What?

66
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:58,780
How long are you gonna keep me in here?
If this is just temporary.

67
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,616
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead. I...

68
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,454
I need to know that I can trust you.

69
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,290
To see the truth.

70
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,959
What truth is that?

71
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,754
Everything I have done,
I have done for you.

72
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,048
Even this?

73
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,926
Even this.

74
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,141
Oh, God.

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,396
I wish I knew what you were thinking.

76
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,023
Tell me.

77
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,700
What's in the box? Tell me.

78
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,287
Tell me I'm crazy.

79
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,333
Tell me you didn't kill Benji.

80
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,838
Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

81
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,675
If you knew what I knew.

82
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,183
Shit, Beck, that's right.
You have no idea.

83
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,394
I promised you the truth
and I'm gonna give you that.

84
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,275
Wait, Joe! Don't leave!

85
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,113
I'm not. We're gonna get through this.

86
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,782
Joe?

87
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:31,414
Joe! No, Joe! Joe! Joe!

88
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,299
That could've gone worse.

89
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,761
I knew you'd be scared.

90
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,056
That's why I tried to protect you
from the truth.

91
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,100
Now I need to protect us from the world...

92
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,353
...long enough to work this out.

93
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,940
So business as usual is the best cover.

94
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,779
As far as your friends are concerned,
you're going off the grid.

95
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:11,370
And it wouldn't be a true social media
detox without announcing it to the world.

96
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,795
I'll be back soon.
The basement is off-limits

97
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,256
until I finish open-heart surgery
on a first-edition Sylvia Plath.

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,801
Nice. What kinda condition she in?

99
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,845
Fragile. Very fragile.

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:36,020
Evidence. Evidence is all I need
to prove to you that I'm not some sicko.

101
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,981
I'm your protector. You'll see.

102
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,030
Let's skip the "nothing to see here,"
get straight to moving along.

103
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,241
No, this is my building.
That's my neighbor, Claudia.

104
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,617
- Your neighbor, huh?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,577
So then you know the piece of shit
who gave her a concussion?

106
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,122
-Yeah, his name is Ron.
-I know who he is.

107
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,626
That's him.
Why is he not in the back of your cruiser?

108
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,711
Victim insisted
it was an accident.

109
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,465
She has a kid. Paco. Where is he?

110
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,260
I didn't see any children in there.
Probably for the best.

111
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,728
Joe.
You can't leave me in here.

112
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,856
I'm... I'm not. I'm sorry.

113
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,942
It's pointless to try to explain anything
to you without evidence. So...

114
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,279
no more secrets. Ask me anything.

115
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,995
So we both knew Benji was a dick, right?
What you didn't know...

116
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,459
He was a murderer.
He killed an innocent kid.

117
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,712
He's playing dead.
He's playing dead. Oh, shit.

118
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,092
No remorse. I fully maintain
he was sociopathic and dangerous.

119
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:52,305
Dangerous for you.
And Peach, she was obsessed.

120
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,974
She was hoarding these. For years.

121
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,186
She needed to own you,
to trap you, to make you her pet.

122
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,104
And what happened once she was gone?

123
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,858
You blossomed. You were published.

124
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,410
I get why you'd be freaked.
They're all stuffed in like this.

125
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,039
But they're just mementos, you know?
Like holding onto an old photograph.

126
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,334
Or you wearing my shirt to sleep.

127
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,754
You can't tell me that's so crazy.
It's the stuff of a million love songs.

128
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,884
I know this is a lot. Honestly,
I'm terrified sharing this with you.

129
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,093
But if we're being honest,

130
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
your life has been better
since you met me.

131
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,807
You just didn't know how or why until now.

132
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,810
Beck, I love you.

133
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,147
And loving someone means
you will do anything for them.

134
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,660
Benji's.

135
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,079
I had to burn his body.

136
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,581
And Peach?

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,042
She tried to kill me.
That was straight-up self-defense.

138
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,379
- It was self-defense--
- Oh, God!

139
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,755
No, please don't.

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,925
- Please!
- No, no, no, calm down. Please.

141
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,760
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please calm down.

142
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,971
No, you don't understand.
Please calm down. Beck--

143
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,180
- You killed them!
- Beck! Beck! Beck!

144
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,058
-You're a murderer! You freak!
-No, that's not true.

145
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,768
- Get away from me!
- No, you--

146
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,853
- Please don't hurt me.
- You don't understand.

147
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,647
I would never hurt someone I love.

148
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,567
Tell that to Candace, you sick fuck!

149
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,861
You're not listening.

150
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,707
Help!

151
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,834
Help!

152
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,129
Help!

153
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,466
Help me, please! Please!

154
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,664
Good morning.

155
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,959
- Get away!
- Jesus! It's okay.

156
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,214
What were you trying to do to me?

157
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,675
I was just making it cozy. Look.

158
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
You were sleeping so deep.
I didn't want to disturb you.

159
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,138
Well...

160
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,099
consider me disturbed.

161
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,523
Here, I brought you breakfast.

162
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,694
Somehow, being inches
from a bucket of my own pee has...

163
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,946
killed my appetite.

164
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,990
Oh, well, I emptied the bucket.

165
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,910
In case you ever doubt
what I'm willing to do for love.

166
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:09,418
And you're not gonna want to pass up
avocado toast from Dudley's.

167
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,088
And coffee how you like it.

168
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,676
I always wondered what that was for.

169
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,219
Oh, yeah.

170
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,473
Mooney claims he built it
for secure cash transactions.

171
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,059
I never saw anybody down here but me.

172
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,980
I spent a lot of time in here
when I was younger.

173
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,733
I was always getting into trouble.
Mooney...

174
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
He...

175
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,655
He was my Mr. Miyagi.

176
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,201
If Miyagi was a Soviet prison guard.

177
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,662
Who am I to you?

178
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,207
-You're an asshole.
-Yes. But who else do you have?

179
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,711
Your father,
who used your armpit for an ashtray?

180
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
Your mother,
who never did anything to stop him?

181
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,177
Or maybe you miss that insect-ridden
group home that drove you to my doorstep.

182
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,138
You don't care about me.

183
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,182
This place could be your salvation.

184
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,353
Here, you're safe...

185
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,232
surrounded by
the greatest works of humanity.

186
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,651
With no choice but to absorb...

187
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:19,029
...the wisdom of better men.

188
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,240
Beck, in the end,
the cage was a good thing for me.

189
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,286
I'm hoping it'll be the same for you.
Look, hence, typewriter, paper.

190
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,203
No distractions.

191
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,709
It's the low-tech writer's retreat
you always wanted.

192
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,214
I feel bad for you, Joe.

193
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:47,099
Was that pity? Disgust? Empathy?

194
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,395
Beck, I am really
putting myself out there.

195
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,938
The least you could do
is acknowledge that.

196
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,566
Hey! Not today, little man.
Hey! Look at me.

197
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,693
Are you out of your mind?
What do you think you're doing?

198
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,652
Get your hands off him.

199
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,529
I caught this punk trying to steal
the gun from the register!

200
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,573
Okay, all right. It's not loaded.

201
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,491
Oh, it's loaded.

202
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,617
I'll handle it.

203
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,500
Sit. This is not a toy.

204
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,418
- I know. I'm not dumb.
- I think you are.

205
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,046
I think only an idiot tries
what you just pulled.

206
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,672
I know why you want a gun, Paco.

207
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,466
Even if you don't kill yourself
with this thing first,

208
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,843
the second you use it on Ron,
your life is over.

209
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,179
That is the definition of dumb.

210
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,857
I know that was harsh.

212
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,986
It's a key to my place.
You can go there. It's safe.

213
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,865
Cool down. Crash as long as you need to.
And we'll talk about this later.

214
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,795
I'm not thinking straight
and it's your fault.

215
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,589
Beck, I can only buy us so much time.

216
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,008
And my patience is wearing thin.

217
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,134
Joe, where have you been?

218
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,511
-Hey.
-Hey.

219
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,472
Let's skip the small talk.
I just want to know if Beck is okay.

220
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,809
-Wait, what do you mean "okay"?
-We had a fight. I haven't heard from her.

221
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,270
Oh, I think it's okay to tell you
she's on a writing retreat.

222
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,272
Yeah.

223
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,816
It's all good, relax.
She's not texting us either.

224
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,193
-Okay.
-I just wanna know she's safe.

225
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,154
What was the fight about?

227
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,781
Uh...

228
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,453
I caught her cheating.
With her therapist.

229
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,997
- No way.
- What?

230
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,875
-Oh, my God. No way.
-Dr. Nicky? Is she kidding?

231
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,836
-Beck!
-Whoa. Joe, I am so sorry.

232
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,255
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
- So sorry.

233
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,008
- We had no idea.
- I thought we could work through it.

234
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,510
But then she ghosted me.

235
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,638
Wait. When she texted,
she said that her retreat was therapeutic.

236
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,100
-You don't think that she's still--
-I mean, yeah.

237
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,227
Wow.

238
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,979
Wow.

239
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,277
I really thought you two were endgame.

240
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,739
It just kinda shakes your faith,
you know? I don't know.

241
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,033
Do you really believe
that Beck and I are the real deal?

242
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,453
Joe, I've known Beck a long time,
and I have...

243
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,372
I've never seen her happier.

244
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,792
Or, like, more grounded or whatever.

245
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,504
I really think that you bring out
the best in her.

246
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,673
I think she brings out
the best in me, too.

247
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,842
Hey, maybe it's not so bad.

248
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,637
Maybe she's really
on a writing retreat, you know?

249
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,847
Or maybe she's just
trying to dodge that PI

250
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,265
'cause she doesn't feel like
talking about Peach.

251
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
PI? What do you mean?

252
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,311
Apparently a Salinger
would never commit suicide,

253
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,147
-according to the Salingers.
-It is so messed up.

254
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,523
They hired this guy.

255
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,401
He's been asking Lynn and I
all of these questions.

256
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
He even used the term "foul play."
Can you believe that?

257
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,785
Joe, we both know what you did.
Why are you surprised?

258
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,917
I'm not gonna finish these wontons.
You want 'em?

259
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,086
Okay.

260
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,300
Thank you.

261
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,848
I recommend the ponzu.
The sweet-and-sour is too sour.

262
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,394
Noted.

263
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,566
You haven't started writing.

264
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,447
I'm still waiting for that surge
of inspiration I was promised.

265
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,371
You seem like you're doing
a little better.

266
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,750
Maybe it's relative.

267
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,168
Yeah.

268
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,842
I caught Paco trying to steal a gun
from the register today.

269
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,927
What? Why?

270
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
Ron put Claudia in the hospital.

271
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:01,562
So Paco... I tried talking to him.
I think I just made him angrier.

272
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:09,194
Well, you got your girlfriend locked up
in a cage, a PI snooping around...

273
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,781
and you're worried
about your neighbor's kid.

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,367
I know. It's pretty dumb.

275
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,536
No.

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,538
It's sweet.

277
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,419
Joe,

278
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,339
I know...

279
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,469
there's a good heart in there, somewhere.

280
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,143
Joe?

281
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,395
Yeah?

282
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,317
I have to pee.

283
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh, no, tell me you're not using

284
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,580
Henry Pelham's cartography
as a seat cover.

285
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,083
Sorry, I couldn't find any Dan Brown.

286
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,627
-Yeah. I'll get--
-Joe?

287
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,465
Can I...

288
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,470
Can I just please use the bathroom?

289
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,307
Please. This is dehumanizing.

290
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,685
You can trust me.

291
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:49,294
Thank you. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

292
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,189
- Joe?
- I can't.

293
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,526
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,778
Joe.

295
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,866
Joe, please.

296
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,620
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

297
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,040
I am so stupid.

298
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,004
This whole time, I was wrong.

299
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,923
How did I not see this?

300
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,302
If you see this place as a prison,
that's all you're gonna be, a prisoner.

301
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,139
If you see it as an opportunity
for introspection and growth,

302
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,558
voilà, we have a future together.

303
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,606
You say you're a writer.
I fell in love with a writer.

304
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,233
Maybe you should be writing.

305
00:19:54,943 --> 00:20:00,324
What now, Joe?
You're gonna go jerk off to my panties?

306
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,453
Or do you need to cut someone up
before you can get hard?

307
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,395
How the hell did you end up here?

308
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,150
Your life has been better
since you met me.

309
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,777
You just didn't know how or why.

310
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,445
You paint me out to be this monster.

311
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,657
Someone who could hurt people,
who could do terrible things.

312
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,705
"You used to wrap yourself
In fairy tales

313
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,998
Like a blanket

314
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,501
But it was the cold you loved

315
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,839
Sharp shivers as you uncovered
The corpses of Bluebeard's wives

316
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,426
Sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming

317
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,429
Slid one glass slipper
Over your little toes

318
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,514
A perfect fit

319
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,771
But by the schoolyard, real princesses
Floated by you on fall winds

320
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,857
You saw the gulf
Between you and the rich girls

321
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,652
And vowed to stop believing
In fairy tales

322
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,198
But the stories were in you
Deep as poison

323
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,952
If Prince Charming was real
If he could save you

324
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,998
You needed to be saved
From the unfairness of everything

325
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,542
When would he come?

326
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,755
The answer was a cruel shrug
In a hundred fleeting moments

327
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,926
The sneer on Stevie Smith's face
When he called you a fat cow

328
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,514
Uncle Jeff's hand squeezing your ass
In the Thanksgiving kitchen

329
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:53,020
The accusation in your father's eyes
When you told him what happened

330
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,986
From every boy masquerading as a man
That you let into your body, your heart

331
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:06,033
You learned you didn't have
Whatever magic turns a beast into a prince

332
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,747
You surrounded yourself
With the girls you'd always resented

333
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,667
Hoping to share their power
And you hated yourself

334
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,587
And that diminished you even more

335
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:24,217
And then, right when you thought
You might just disappear

336
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,595
He saw you

337
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,307
And you knew somewhere deep
It was too good to be true

338
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,851
But you let yourself be swept

339
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,312
Because he was the first
Strong enough to lift you

340
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,690
Now in his castle you understand

341
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,152
Prince Charming and Bluebeard
Are the same man

342
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,490
And you don't get a happy end
Unless you love both of him

343
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,618
Didn't you want this?

344
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,788
To be loved?
Didn't you want him to crown you?

345
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,707
Didn't you ask for it?
Didn't you ask for it?

346
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,918
Didn't you ask for it?

347
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,961
So say you can live like this

348
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,297
Say you love him
Say thank you

349
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,799
Say anything but the truth

350
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,010
What if you can't love him back?"

351
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,266
What if you're not the one?

352
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,521
No, now is not the time
to abandon principles.

353
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,317
I have to believe love conquers all,

354
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,821
and if you love me,
it's only a matter of time.

355
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,867
But time is not on our side.

356
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,581
I don't want to think worst-case.

357
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,876
I don't like having to scour your place

358
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,546
for evidence that'd link me
to your disappearance.

359
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,882
It's all starting to feel a little dirty.

360
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,386
'Cause I'm not doing it for you anymore.

361
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm doing it for me.

362
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,851
And I'm not a selfish person.

363
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,191
You said you believe
I have a good heart, "somewhere."

364
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,444
I hope you don't mind
if I take a minute to look for it.

365
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,405
Claudia?

366
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,741
Joe. What are you doing here?

367
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,327
I'm looking for Paco. Is Ron around?

368
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,831
No. And I was hoping
that Paco went to find you.

369
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,875
I lost my cell phone when...

370
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,628
Nurses said they tried calling
the apartment but nobody answered.

371
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,381
So you have no idea where your son is?

372
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,426
Jesus, Claudia.

373
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,929
So damn easy to judge, huh?
Who the hell are you?

374
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,433
I'm the only one in this city
who cares about your son, apparently.

375
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,268
Why do you do this?

376
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,396
Why do you protect the man
who does this to you over your child?

377
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,148
Over and over? You're his mother.

378
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,152
Mothers are supposed to protect
their children from men like him.

379
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,155
I don't need a concerned neighbor
bursting in here

380
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,157
and blaming me for my own concussion.

381
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,747
Ron has connections. He's made threats.

382
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,583
You wanna know
why he's still in the picture?

383
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,254
I stand up to him, I lose my boy.

384
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,345
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

385
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,721
Yeah, of course you didn't.

386
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,266
You have no idea
what it takes to live my life.

387
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,353
They don't write books
about women like me.

388
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,855
No one would think to.

389
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,531
Joe Goldberg?

390
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,161
Hello, PI.

391
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,120
Have we met?

392
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,373
Hi. I work for the family
of Peach Salinger.

393
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,626
-Just a couple quick questions.
-Okay, sure. Of course.

394
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,877
How well did you know Peach?

395
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,963
He's asking, but he knows already.

396
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,799
Not well. Through my ex, Guinevere Beck.

397
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,009
Well enough to be saddened by her passing.

398
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,427
You been to her house in Greenwich?

399
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,932
That's where she died, right? No, no.
I heard about it through Beck.

400
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,519
I know that Peach was having a hard time
when they were out there. Um...

401
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,438
Yeah. I think you should talk to Beck.

402
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,274
I've been trying to
get ahold of Beck, actually.

403
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,736
Yeah, well, we broke up...

404
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,698
so I'm not really in touch.

405
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,659
In fact, if you found me, that means
you probably found Lynn, Beck's friend.

406
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,743
She's the one to ask.

407
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,831
Beck, she might be out of town, writing.
She does that.

408
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,709
So, good luck. It was nice to meet you.

409
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,295
You spend a lot of time at her place
when she's out of town?

410
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,297
Shit.

411
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,298
Well, I...

412
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,382
He saw me.

413
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,552
I still have a key.
No, in fact, I had a key.

414
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,053
I returned it last night.

415
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,017
Should I be worried?
Are you following me?

416
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,977
Your ex ever tell you
that Peach had a stalker?

417
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:50,066
I mean, I know... I remember
the awful Central Park incident.

418
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,651
Peach was attacked, right?

419
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,112
But I wasn't aware it was anything
more than a random robbery.

420
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,948
The same individual may have been
in the house the weekend Peach died.

421
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,783
Seriously?

422
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,703
Found an item.
We're testing it for DNA now.

423
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,038
Wow.

424
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,375
That would be crazy.

425
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,627
I forgot the goddamn jar.

426
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,714
Well, if it's true,
I hope you find the guy.

427
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,507
I should've pissed myself.

428
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,968
Let me know if there's anything I can do.

429
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,847
Thanks, Joe. You mind calling
if you think of anything else?

430
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,183
Yeah.

431
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,560
And does urine even hold DNA?

432
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,812
Will do, Ross. Yeah.

433
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,274
One thing I learned
from my own time in a cage, Beck.

434
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,027
Never let yourself panic.

435
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,990
No matter how bad it is, you find a way
to stay calm and keep your wits.

436
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,554
I've been stupid to be mad.

437
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,892
I messed up,
and you're trying to help me do better.

438
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,771
I know it's hard to understand,

439
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,235
but sometimes we do difficult things
out of caring for someone.

440
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,744
I know the demons that drive you.

441
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,955
I have them, too.

442
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,707
It takes discipline...

443
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,128
to prevail.

444
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,341
That's why I work you so hard,
why I demand perfection.

445
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,553
My love for the books. Respect.

446
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:46,141
I'm trying to teach you a code to live by
so that you don't end up like your father.

447
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,019
And when I fail, you lock me in.

448
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,354
Exactly.

449
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,356
Because I love you.

450
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,526
I only hope it'll be enough.

451
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,444
Hey.

452
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,661
Hey, I'm sorry
that I went a little crazy before.

453
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,332
What's for dinner?

454
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,638
What's wrong? What happened?

455
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,099
You remember the PI?
He paid a visit.

456
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,351
You should've seen him.

457
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,937
I don't think he bought a word I said.

458
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,280
I'm not a killer.

459
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,033
I didn't plan this.

460
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,954
If I was some premeditated,
cold-blooded monster,

461
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,249
I wouldn't have missed anything that would
come back to bite me in the ass like this.

462
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,377
What did you miss?

463
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,047
It doesn't matter.

464
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,674
Unless it does, in which case you'll know
because I'll go to prison.

465
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,636
You might get exactly what you want.

466
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,430
I'll go down for something I did for you.

467
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,518
And you'd love that, right?
I mean, that's what you think of me.

468
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,232
No. That's not true.

469
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:24,364
You're not a monster, Joe.
I know I've said some stuff, but...

470
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,992
Come on, you can't expect me to be chill.
I mean, look at us.

471
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,996
For the record,

472
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,458
I don't hate you.

473
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,842
I am trying so hard to understand you.

474
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,679
Can you blame me
if I need a little help getting there?

475
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,394
What about Paco?

476
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,063
What about Paco?

477
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,357
If you go to jail,
the kid is screwed, right?

478
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,150
You think that's what I want?

479
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,945
You're the only person
who is there for him.

480
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,741
I think about what happens to people
who don't have anyone.

481
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,996
Joe, for Paco, okay?

482
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,125
Let's try and figure out a way
through this so that you can...

483
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,008
So that we can be there for him.

484
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,472
Claudia! Just open the door. I want to...

485
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,057
Just want to talk to you. Just...

486
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,478
Hey, let me in. Just wanna...

487
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,954
You little piece of shit!

488
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,557
Paco.

489
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,606
Paco, come here. I want to talk to you.

490
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,111
Paco, come here. Not gonna hurt you.

491
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,583
- Paco?
- Paco!

492
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,418
Get over here. I wanna talk to you.

493
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,637
Paco, come out here.

494
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,519
You're dead.

495
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,271
Hey, Ron.

496
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,452
- Joe!
- Paco!

497
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,136
Okay. This is what I need you to do
so no one finds out about this,

498
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,179
because people are not really
gonna believe us

499
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,597
about the way it happened, right?

500
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,516
Okay, there's blood in the hall.

501
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,145
You clean that up with soap and water,
and then hit those spots with bleach.

502
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,312
Really pour it on, all right?

503
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,273
Now, this next part
might sound a little weird,

504
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,442
but I think it might do the trick.

505
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
See this? It's Ron's phone.

506
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,946
I'm gonna be texting your mom from it.

507
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,700
Maybe Ron's boss, a few of his friends.

508
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,327
So they think he's still alive.

509
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,872
Exactly. So I'm gonna keep that going.

510
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,374
I'm gonna take it far away
from here, get rid of it.

511
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,295
All you have to do is say
you don't know where he is.

512
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,051
Shit.

513
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:21,434
Ron will never hurt or scare you
or your mom ever again.

514
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,145
And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

515
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,772
But it's over.

516
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,526
It's all over now, forever. Right?

517
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,071
He was a bad man.

518
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,323
Yeah.

519
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,284
He was.

520
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,746
Does that mean it was right to kill him?

521
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,000
Sometimes...

522
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,255
we do bad things for the people we love.

523
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,551
Doesn't mean it's right.
It means love is more important.

524
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,514
Hey, go home.

525
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,102
I believe that, Beck.
Love is more important.

526
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,854
But the world is a cruel place.

527
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,651
If I get caught for any of this,
I doubt a jury will see it the same way.

528
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,277
And you?

529
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,238
Will you?

530
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,282
There you are!

531
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,871
Read this, Joe.

532
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,390
A blind-verse rendition
of your love story with Dr. Nicky?

533
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
Keep reading.

534
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,904
What exactly is this?

535
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,157
It's the story of everything that happened

536
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,494
once I started having an affair
with my therapist.

537
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,915
I was broken and trusting
and I needed help.

538
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,670
And he, little did I know,
he was obsessive and very sick,

539
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,298
and would stop at nothing
to get closer to me.

540
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,593
And if you skip to the end,
there's this part

541
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,680
where I talk about a box of mementos
that I found on Nicky's property.

542
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,517
Evidence. A jar of teeth.

543
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:33,316
Joe, don't you see?
Nicky is your way out, Joe.

544
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,610
Our way out.

545
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,154
It's perfect.

546
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,992
I get it now.

547
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,994
- You get what?
- You.

548
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:49,415
You did everything... for me.

549
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,419
No one has ever loved me
the way that you love me.

550
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:58,174
I mean, you gave me everything.

551
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,552
Let me give this to you.

552
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,308
I mean it. I understand.

553
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,477
I was scared. I could've done something...

554
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,272
something really stupid
when I found that box.

555
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,190
But this...

556
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,569
This gave me time to think.

557
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,905
I hurt you. I scared you.

558
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,409
I understand if you hate me.

559
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,372
I love you, actually.

560
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,916
More than ever.

561
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:36,504
And I can wait until you're ready.
It's not so bad in here.

562
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,590
You take care of me.

563
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,804
And no one has ever
taken care of me before.

564
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,597
Not like you.

565
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,849
That's all I ever wanted to do.

566
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,895
And when you're ready,
we can take my story public,

567
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,108
and then you and I,
we can go somewhere and start our life...

568
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,903
And I haven't
thought beyond that.

569
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,863
But, Joe, I...

570
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:09,620
I know that I am better with you
than without you.

571
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,122
Beck.

572
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,835
If you were in here, this would be
our moment to kiss as, like,

573
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,963
the music swells and everything.

574
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,093
But I know...

575
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,555
I know you don't trust me enough yet.

576
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,432
I get it.

577
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,603
We're crazy.

578
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,820
Beck!

579
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,705
Wait, wait, wait, please.
Wait, I know you're angry. I know.

580
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,084
You have no idea what I am,
you fucking psychopath.

581
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,835
I knew it was too good to be true.

582
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,589
What, all the nice things I said to you
while I was locked in a cage?

583
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,677
You actually believe that all of this
is somehow justified.

584
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,595
It is.

585
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,263
You are insane.

586
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,600
You think that you did some bad shit
and that I did some bad shit

587
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,019
and that this is equivalent?

588
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:03,109
Yeah, I lied. I cheated.
But I didn't stalk you,

589
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:08,280
I didn't hit you. I didn't kill people.
I didn't do any of this!

590
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,618
There's not a line in the world
that I wouldn't cross for you.

591
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,204
I didn't ask you to swoop in for me.

592
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,455
But you did. Your life was a mess.

593
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,665
Yes, but it was my life.

594
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:23,212
And I didn't need some sociopath
on a white horse to clean house.

595
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:28,050
I mean, what gives you the right?
You thought that I would be grateful?

596
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,638
You...

597
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,099
you are him.

598
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,477
You are the bad thing.

599
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,856
You are the thing
that you should have killed.

600
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,359
If you let me out, we can just talk.

601
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,947
You know what I think?
I think that this was all just an excuse.

602
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,617
An excuse to justify
creeping into girls' lives

603
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,953
and violating the shit out of them.

604
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,706
I think you love it. The power.

605
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,249
-You love it!
-No.

606
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,959
- No, I don't.
- I think that this...

607
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:07,840
this was the perfect excuse
to take out people like Benji and Peach,

608
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,886
who've always looked down on you
and your whole miserable life.

609
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,220
-God, but you--
-No.

610
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,722
You are not special.

611
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,390
You're broken.

612
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,976
I could never love you.

613
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,107
Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

614
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,777
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.

615
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,041
Joe?

616
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,011
Help!

617
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,098
Help! Help!

618
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,771
Paco! Paco, thank God. I need your help.
Open this door right now.

619
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,232
Joe, he is downstairs. And he's crazy.

620
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,692
Joe?

621
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,946
Paco, he has killed people.
He's gonna kill me.

622
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,364
Open this door right now.

623
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,119
Paco, open the door!
Open the door, please!

624
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,540
Please! Paco, no! No, Paco!

625
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,543
No!

626
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,629
Keys. Keys.

627
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,311
When Mooney locked me in,
I learned a big lesson.

628
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,981
Hide a spare key so you can get out
of the goddamn cage.

629
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,153
- I didn't want it to be like this, Beck.
- I know.

630
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,198
I know. Just...

631
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,326
put me back in there.

632
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,335
These have been
selling like crazy.

633
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,961
Is it true she worked here?

634
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,713
Yeah, it's true. I knew her well.

635
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,424
I'm so sorry.
It's really tragic.

636
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,092
It's pretty weird when someone dies

637
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,720
and you literally can't get away
from them on the news.

638
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,015
Enjoy the book.
She was a really good writer.

639
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,768
You really were, Beck.

640
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,979
I miss you so much.

641
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:14,652
It's been a weird four months.
I had to do a lot for you, in the end.

642
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:19,531
♪ I need my girl ♪

643
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,872
♪ I need my girl ♪

644
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:33,128
You wrote the story.
All I did was bring it to life.

645
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,342
The story was perfect,
so everyone believed it.

646
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,098
There he is!

647
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,060
Doctor! Doctor!
What drove you to murder Guinevere Beck?

648
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,271
Yes, she was definitely
having an affair with her therapist.

649
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,356
That evil .

650
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,651
You know, our friend Peach Salinger
was trying to get Beck to stop seeing him.

651
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,278
So it's like,
did that psycho kill Peach, too?

652
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,697
I received the manuscript
in the mail.

653
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,574
It was odd, but far and away

654
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,160
the most moving prose I'd read
since Zadie's second-to-last.

655
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,287
It was also the most horrifying,

656
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,581
because I came to understand

657
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,043
that Beck was illuminating
her very own imminent murder.

658
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,837
That's when I knew.

659
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,923
I had to show it
to my literary agent right away.

660
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,969
It's true, maybe not everyone
was completely convinced.

661
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,762
Bullshit.

662
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,974
But you know what? Doesn't matter.
The evidence was overwhelming.

663
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,935
Thanks to your hard work...

664
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:31,645
and mine.

665
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,400
It was the last thing
we ever did together.

666
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,485
In the end, you couldn't love me.

667
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,071
I feel at peace with that now

668
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,241
because I loved you
the absolute best that I could.

669
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,328
And I gave you what you wanted.
I feel good about that.

670
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,914
I helped you become the writer
you so wanted to be.

671
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,960
Your lurid memoir of Dr. Nicky
was the lead,

672
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,753
but I cobbled that manuscript together

673
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,339
from every one of your pieces
fit to print.

674
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,843
The book is yours, Beck,
and it made you famous.

675
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,638
It's sad you're not here to see it.

676
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,100
But I know you would be so happy.

677
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,905
So, California.

678
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,948
That's great, you know?

679
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,742
You got the job. Paco's gonna love it.

680
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,953
Yeah, I think so. Weather's so good.

681
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,748
So, Ron.

682
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,293
Disappeared into thin air. I don't get it.

683
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,087
But, you know,
everyone knew he was a troubled guy.

684
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,965
He had gambling debts.
Who knows? It's for the best.

685
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,261
I know I haven't always been
the nicest about it,

686
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:50,140
but thanks for always being
so good to my son.

687
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,436
Yeah, it's nothing. Really.

688
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,648
I'll let you say goodbye.

689
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,197
Hey, Pac.

690
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:07,908
I'll miss you.

691
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,202
Me, too.

692
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:14,122
Hey, you know,
it's okay if things are hard sometimes.

693
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,668
You can still be a good person.

694
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,922
And have a really good life.
That's what I want for you.

695
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,217
This is good. A fresh start.

696
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,432
You're gonna put
the bad things behind you.

697
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,350
Yeah.

698
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,311
You, too.

699
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,610
I'm trying. I am.

700
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,949
But I'll admit, it's getting harder
to live with so much heartbreak.

701
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,329
And there are days
I just don't believe in love.

702
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,500
I tell myself to keep my heart open.

703
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,961
That in the end, I was wrong about you.

704
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,922
Every relationship
teaches us hard lessons, right?

705
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,716
That's their gift.

706
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:10,596
To make us ready for the day when someone,
maybe the one, walks in,

707
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,348
who could truly love us...

708
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,144
and we could truly love them.

709
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,939
Well...

710
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,234
hello there.

711
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,236
Who are you?

712
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,366
You've got that hoodie.
You don't like to be stared at.

713
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:36,663
But your legs are bare.
You like a little attention.

714
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,418
Okay, I'll bite.

715
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,058
Hey, Bunny.

716
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,187
-Candace, you're--
-Alive.

717
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,106
Yeah.

718
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,486
So, I think we have some
unfinished business to talk about.
