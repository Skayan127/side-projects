<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>I still believe...</i>

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,023
- You okay there, Joe?
<i>- ...in The One.</i>

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?</i>

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,260
Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,822
Now he's threatening me.

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,948
Stay away from her.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>As long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.</i>

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,749
How much do you know
about Love's first husband?

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,753
Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

11
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,380
And you've been buried in here, obsessed!

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,466
Just move on, okay? She's dead!

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,593
Get the fuck out now!

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,095
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,514
- I killed Natalie for you!
- Shut up.

16
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,724
Go.

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,521
Fuck this.

18
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,525
- What are you doing?
- Stand back!

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,196
You just shot my ear.

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,951
She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her!

21
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,828
Get us out of here, Theo.

22
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>Shirley Jackson wrote</i>

23
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,595

24
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,766

25

<i>Right now, I have to save my son

34
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,260
<i>I just need to get us out</i>

35
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>before Love feeds Henry so much
as another bite.</i>

36
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,813
They're saying she moved to Ohio.

37
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,316
Yeah, sure. She left her plants
and the picture of her mom.

38
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,111
It was her boyfriend.

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,197
- No. Or maybe she ran away.
- I could've stopped him.

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,119
- The last time it ruined my entire life.
- You mean, like, with your mom...?

41
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,413
It made her hate me so much,
she put me here.

42
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,542
So I thought, with Fiona,
I didn't want her to hate me.

43
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,296
For the record, you don't know
how your mom feels. You're making it up.

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,174
Hey, trust me, I do it too.

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,178
But I'll never actually know
why mine left me here.

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,389
Neither will you.

47
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,810
Joe?

48
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,894
I'm home.

49
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,315
<i>Fuck. If she sees blood, it's over.</i>

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,775
Joe?

51
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,032
What are you doing in here?

52
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,576
Looking for a charger. That's the one.

53
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,000
What a fucking day.

54
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,295
We need to figure out
how we're gonna endgame the Conrads.

55
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,756
- Brainstorm...
<i>- Something is up with her.</i>

56
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,050
Also, we need to have an alibi.

57
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,595
- So I did get an Airbnb in Mill Valley.
<i>- She's barely looking at me.</i>

58
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,765
<i>Sherry and Cary aren't enough
to throw her this off-balance.</i>

59
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,850
And the bakery, I have an order.

60
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,437
It's a big one, so that'll be good
to keep everything open.

61
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,398
And I had a thought about us.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Is this...

63
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,027
Conrad blood?

64
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,409
- No, that's Theo. He came by the bakery.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

65
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,035
I, uh... He...

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,955
Um, I had to...

67
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,999
<i>That's what she can't look at.</i>

68
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,417
<i>Poor Theo.</i>

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,461
He's still there, in the basement.

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,632
<i>Fuck. Okay, problem or opportunity?</i>

71
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,260
I'll handle him.
Don't give it another thought.

72
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,343
My epiphany.

73
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,513
I was just thinking,

74
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,475
like, we're gonna be through this
so soon, right?

75
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>I hope.</i>

76
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,728
- Right?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,065
I just think it's perfect, so...
To really fucking start a new chapter.

78
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,736
It's time for us
to try for another baby, Joe.

79
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,528
<i>I'm...</i>

80
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
<i>actually speechless.</i>

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,371
I want nothing more in the world, Love.

82
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah, let's do it.

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,133
<i>Too bad, tomorrow,
Henry and I will be gone.</i>

84
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:46,054
<i>Of course, this all hinges
on the only question that matters.</i>

85
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>When I go...</i>

86
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,310
<i>will you come with me?</i>

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,918
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,047
Theo, hi, it's me.
Can you call me and check in, please?

89
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,054
I was too harsh when I kicked you out...

90
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
but you don't have to...

91
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,020
<i>Just let me know you're okay, please.</i>

92
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>You poor, dumb kid.</i>

93
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,949
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,501
- Come on, man.
- He's not coming back.

95
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,212
It's been hours.

96
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,714
Hey, let me see that.

97
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,009
No.

98
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,222
Sher, I took a survival medicine seminar
with a dude who won Season 6 of <i>Alone.</i>

99
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,434
I can't hear you...

100
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,645
because you shot me in the ear.

101
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,855
It ricocheted.

102
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,566
Tell that to the part of my ear
plastered to that bucket.

103
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,153
- Red flag, okay? This is my turn.
- No. No more techniques.

104
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,864
<i>Love's right.
They are gonna argue to death.</i>

105
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,866
<i>Marriage brings out the worst in us all.</i>

106
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,369
- That's not fair. Just let me...
- Don't! You've done enough.

107
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,415
- You're... You're hysterical.
- Fuck you! That is sexist as shit!

108
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,500
I am a feminist...

109
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,586
who grazed you!

110
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,797
Oh, you wanna know
what grazing feels like?

111
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
- Hey, hey!
- Don't get hysterical.

112
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,594
- I took a seminar.
- Hey, hey!

113
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,764
<i>Oh, fuck. I'm gonna need more tarps.</i>

114
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,601
No!

115
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,394
Oh, my God.

116
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,231
- Cary?
- You didn't graze me.

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,067
You fucking...

118
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,905
shot me in the leg.

119
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,835
- Hey, I've been trying to reach you.
<i>- Um, Joe...</i>

120
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
Ryan's dead.

121
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
- What?
<i>- Mugging, apparently.</i>

122
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,635
Been a few in the area. Guy with a knife.

123
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:35,264
Seems like this just went really bad,
but the police still interrogated me.

124
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,226
I feel like this is gonna blow back on me.

125
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,978
<i>- I just know it.</i>
- This was part of a string of muggings?

126
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,481
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

127
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:48,027
- Weren't you with Juliette last night?
- Yes, I was. I have an alibi, but...

128
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,906
I also have a very long history
of being fucked by the system.

129
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,116
A system that was made by and for Ryan.

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,743
Can I disagree?

131
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,246
Not about the system
but just about this moment.

132
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,543
I'd love to be wrong.

133
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,671
Listen, the man who hurt you,

134
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,716
who wanted to steal your child...

135
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,428
he is now gone forever.

136
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,723
You shouldn't send the mugger flowers,

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,643
but I am saying
this is your life getting easier.

138
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,189
- Promise not to judge?
- No, never.

139
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,858
I'm glad he's dead.

140
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,117
Can I tell you something else
that happened last night?

141
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
Love and I are officially separating.

142
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,582
Wait, seriously?

143
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,044
But, like, no, I'm... I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

144
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>Don't be.</i>

145
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,340
We're both gonna be free... very soon.

146
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>Why don't you get out of town
while this Ryan drama dies down?</i>

147
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,600
- Yeah, we should.
- Just think of some place you wanna go.

148
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,560
Anywhere. And just go.

149
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,521
Hey, Joe.

150
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
Come with us.

151
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,325
I know, I know, that's crazy.

152
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,035
No, it's not, it's not.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,289
You've been such a rock,
and I let myself fantasize about a...

154
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,418
About a simple, happy, healthy family
for a second, and when I...

155
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,589
When I picture that, I picture you.
And Henry, of course.

156
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>And I know you said you love me,</i>

157
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,677
but it was in a certain moment,
I get that,

158
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,263
but I realized, I actually, um...

159
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,351
I love you.

160
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>I love you, and...</i>

161
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>Yeah, so that.</i>

162
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,695
That's probably way too much, too soon.

163
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>No.</i>

164
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,947
Marienne.

165
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,949
Yes!

166
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,993
Yes. Count us in.

167
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,206
We'd be crazy not to try after everything
we've been through to get here, right?

168
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,667
We just have to tie up a few loose ends.

169
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,503
I can't believe we're doing this.

170
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,881
I can. It's fate.

171
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,009
Mm. Gotta go.

172
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,138
Bunch of songbirds just landed on me
and I think we're going flying.

173
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,019
I'll see you in the sky.

174
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,824
<i>You invited me, we have a future.</i>

175
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,995
<i>This will be the last ugly thing
I ever have to do.</i>

176
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,295
<i>Come on.</i>

177
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,219
<i>Love couldn't even finish the job.
So much for a clean break.</i>

178
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,722
<i>The kid knows everything. If he talks...</i>

179
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,147
<i>Finish it. No one would know.</i>

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,773
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,068
I'm so, so sorry.

182
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,152
<i>I would know.</i>

183
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,030
<i>Didn't I just promise the love of my life</i>

184
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,117
<i>a happy, healthy, new beginning?</i>

185
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,038
I will never...

186
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,459
touch her again.

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,879
You think
this is because you kissed my wife?

188
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,172
It was once.

189
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, you fucked my wife?

190
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,304
<i>What a mess my wife has made.</i>

191
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,557
I loved her.

192
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,979
Why did she do this?

193
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,066
This is not your fault. She fooled me too.

194
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,402
Are you gonna...

195
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
kill me?

196
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>There is a hospital 20 minutes away.
My escape window is closing.</i>

197
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,341
<i>I gotta keep this kid
from blabbing the second he's admitted.</i>

198
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,445
Okay, Theo,

199
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,659
I'm going to give you a little nap,
all right?

200
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,411
Cary Conrad uses this stuff all the time.

201
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,248
So it shouldn't exacerbate
your head injury.

202
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,331
<i>Too much.</i>

203
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,674
Julie.

204
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,803
Julia.

205
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,972
Julia Quinn-Goldberg.

206
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,141
- Who do you think it was?
- Word on the street is mugging.

207
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,560
- "The street"? Name your source.
- I saw a tweet.

208
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,853
From "the street"?

209
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,606
No, we went past the crime scene.

210
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,734
There was a lot of blood.
I bet it was Matthew.

211
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,820
- But why on earth would Matthew...?
- Sherry's blog. They're hiding.

212
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,780
Matthew is insane.

213
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,241
And Ryan reported
on the Natalie investigation.

214
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,328
What if Ryan was asking
too many questions?

215
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,122
Hey, hey, heads up!
Fifty grand coming through.

216
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,957
- Not a fan?
- He's my ex.

217
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,586
What if the only way
to hide the truth was to murder him?

218
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,839
The library fundraiser's coming up.
My boss asked me to work late.

219
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,382
Yeah. He's a gem.

220
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,802
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up.

221
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,476
Not up to your standards?

222
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,811
Yeah.

223
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Can't all be winners.

224
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,736
Hey, can you make
two dozen bloody-looking ones by tonight?

225
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,614
I'm having my true-crime book club
over to dish.

226
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,697
Yeah, sure.

227
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,870
What's your theory?
I think, his ex, Marienne Bellamy, right?

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,498
My lawyer friend said
that they were in a custody fight,

229
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,417
and she seems off, you know?

230
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,129
Her ex becomes all successful
and then when she wants him back,

231
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,882
she can't
and it's, like, crime of passion.

232
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,551
What do you think?

233
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,430
You're all scandal-hungry crows
and no amount of feasting

234
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,350
on other people's sorrows is gonna
make your lives less hollow.

235
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,565
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,653
PMS.

237
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,404
Right.

238
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,826
- I'll have those cupcakes for you.
- Great. Thank you.

239
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,203
Hey, guys.

240
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,286
Hi.

241
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,250
Get away from me!

242
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,419
- It was only supposed to graze you.
- No! That...

243
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,822
- You just made me so mad!
- That was your pull...

244
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

245
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,175
Hey.

246
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,485
- You know, you were right.
- What?

247
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,156
Joe's cheating.

248
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
Oh.

249
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,998
Oh.

250
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,085
Love.

251
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,004
Kill him.

252
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,052
He was abusive.

253
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,512
He forced you into this.

254
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,225
I'll back you up. You know I will.
Then you can let me out.

255
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,309
Us.

256
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,521
You can let us out.

257
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,692
Everybody will believe you.
It's always the husbands.

258
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:53,781
You know, they force us
into these shapes and we break.

259
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,202
But you and me, we're strong, right?

260
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,788
All you gotta do is...

261
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,501
He fucking betrayed you, Love.

262
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,305
You're a fucking monster.

263
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,520
I always knew your marriage was a sham.

264
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:31,110
But... it looks like the only murderer
in this room is you, Sherry.

265
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,746
I can't believe that you just did that.

266
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,503
<i>Unceremonious,</i>

267
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>dumping Theo at a loading dock,
but he's safe.</i>

268
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,632
<i>Now there's no time to pack.</i>

269
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,469
<i>It'll be a miracle if I can get us out
before Love gets suspicious.</i>

270
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,306
- Oh, hey, Joe.
- Hey, Lansing.

271
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,725
Hey, Dante, I'm here to pick up Henry.

272
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,854
- Love picked him up two hours ago?
- Yeah.

273
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,563
<i>No.</i>

274
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,233
- Oh, great.
- Was that not the plan?

275
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,860
<i>No, it sure wasn't.</i>

276
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,779
It was. She texted me
and I spaced, so I'm sorry.

277
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,281
Nice to see you both.

278
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,657
See you.

279
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,120
<i>Oh, no.</i>

280
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>She can't know.</i>

281
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,680
Smells amazing.

282
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>How could she know?</i>

283
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
It's roast chicken.

284
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,396
- Hmm. Where's Henry?
- He's asleep.

285
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,733
- I'm gonna check on him.
- No.

286
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,567
Sit.

287
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>She knows.</i>

288
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,704
Mm.

289
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,167
Tastes amazing as ever.

290
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,086
- I'm a great cook.
- You are.

291
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,337
You really are.

292
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,756
And I'm great in bed.

293
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,970
Pretty, funny, devoted wife and mom.

294
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,263
It's all true.

295
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,057
Hey, did you check out Twitter today?

296
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,018
A news guy was murdered.

297
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,980
Ryan Goodwin.

298
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,899
I was like, "Where do I know him from?"

299
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,860
So I Googled him, and...

300
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,155
he's your boss's ex-husband.

301
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,783
And I saw him at the library thing.

302
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,118
Where I saw her.

303
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,621
Marienne.

304
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,001
She was lovely.

305
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,962
Stunning, actually.

306
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,756
- Love...
- Do you love her?

307
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,762
I just want the truth.

308
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,809
Oh.

309
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
Did you ever actually love me?

310
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,528
The moment I saw you.

311
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,741
I would do anything for you.

312
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,618
I know that you cheated on me
and you lied.

313
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,078
Okay, can we...?

314
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,581
You made me feel like you really saw me.

315
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,044
Like you were perfectly happy.

316
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,631
You made me feel
like I needed to protect you.

317
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,596
You got so upset
killing objectively horrible people.

318
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,558
So I thought, "He's sensitive.
I can do this for him."

319
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,518
I don't remember you asking.

320
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,105
And then I come to find out
that you are happy to murder,

321
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,815
just for a different woman.

322
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,151
Meanwhile, here I am doing it for you.

323
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,153
A teenager, someone innocent.

324
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,157
Yeah, right. He's just a kid,
who you were having an affair with.

325
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:53,246
We can do this if you are willing to admit
you have not been perfectly happy either.

326
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,167
We have both made mistakes.

327
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,089
I have made some...

328
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,548
big ones.

329
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,802
And I'm sorry, Love.

330
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
I never wanted to hurt you.

331
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,099
I tried, and I know
that you've been trying too.

332
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,434
But it didn't work.

333
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,814
And now we can be honest about that

334
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,483
and deal with this like two adults.

335
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,945
- Meaning what?
- We don't have to do anything impulsive.

336
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,071
What's that mean?

337
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,451
James. James.

338
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,414
What you did to him
when he tried to leave.

339
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,211
- Your mother knew and she told me.
- My mother is a malicious bitch.

340
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,215
All I'm saying is
that we can part ways amicably.

341
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,300
Be there for Henry,
support him, co-parent,

342
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,886
and give each other
the chance to be happy.

343
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,308
Love...

344
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,398
I want a divorce.

345
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,287
I'm gonna go check on him.

346
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,664
- Let me get...
- No, I'll check him. I'll get him.

347
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,180
<i>She may come back with Henry or a machete.</i>

348
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,563
Henry's settled down.

349
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,068
You look like you're gonna throw up.

350
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,198
Well, I just said the D-word to my wife.

351
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,742
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

352
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,371
Look, Joe...

353
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,626
I don't like feeling like this.

354
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,923
- I'm so sorry. I...
- No. No.

355
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,590
You're right.

356
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,596
I always thought
that if I did everything right,

357
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,681
life would turn out
the way it's supposed to.

358
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,808
Doesn't that seem reasonable?

359
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,560
I mean, like, with James...

360
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,438
I took care of him.

361
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,343
Doesn't it seem reasonable to think

362
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,202
that he'd wanna be with me
when he got better?

363
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,697
But...

364
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,411
Here's what I need you
to know about James.

365
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,080
My mom was right.

366
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,081
I did.

367
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,125
I did kill him.

368
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,255
But I didn't mean to.

369
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,177
That was my first time using it, and...

370
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,265
the dosage was too high when ingested.

371
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,518
What dosage was too high?

372
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,644
Aconite.

373
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,397
It's a paralytic.

374
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,691
I just wanted to...

375
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,068
I just wanted to stop him.

376
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,196
Keep him in one place
so we could talk it through.

377
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,116
- You wanted to paralyze him?
- Exactly. Yeah.

378
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,909
Temporarily.

379
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,459
Now, you don't have to worry.

380
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,091
This time,
I'm letting it absorb through the skin.

381
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,266
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no.</i>

382
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,661
Do I need to point out
that none of this would be happening

383
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,978
if you hadn't grabbed a weapon?

384
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

385
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,028
No one will ever love you like I do, Joe.

386
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,825
It's something to think about
while you're lying there.

387
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,333
<i>Okay, this isn't great.</i>

388
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,503
Love...

389
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,744
Apparently, I need
to deliver some cupcakes.

390
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,291
I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

391
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,172
Then... I'm gonna save
our fucking marriage.

392
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do now?</i>

393
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,809
Theo, come on, answer your texts.

394
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,105
Look, we're mad, that's fine.
But now I'm worried.

395
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,025
Call me back or I'm calling the police.
I'm serious.

396
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,124
Hello?

397
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,585
Joe?

398
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,008
Theo!

399
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,927
Theo!

400
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,144
- Holy shit.
<i>- Holy shit.</i>

401
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,146
What the fuck did she do to you?

402
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,857
What's going on? Is Theo here?

403
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,443
<i>Thank you.
If I could just get my voice to work...</i>

404
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,779
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

405
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,591
<i>No! Shit. He calls the police,
truth comes out and I lose Henry.</i>

406
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,827
What? What?

407
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,413
What are you trying to say?

408
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,416
- You don't want me to call the police?
<i>- Yes! Yes, thank you.</i>

409
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,919
What?

410
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,884
You have Theo.

411
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,052
Uh-huh.

412
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,929
Where is he?

413
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,724
Joe, what did she do?

414
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,645
Where is my son?

415
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,689
<i>In the hospital. In the hospital!</i>

416
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,942
You know what Love's been doing
with him, don't you?

417
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,277
You sick fuck!

418
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,616
You took Natalie from me, didn't you?

419
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,575
Didn't you?

420
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,870
Your crazy fucking wife.

421
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:54,167
You knew, and you sat in my house
and you said nothing.

422
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,671
I should kill you.

423
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,801
I should kill you right fucking now.

424
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,679
- What?
<i>- Follow my eyes.</i>

425
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,265
<i>Come on. I'm pointing with my eyes.</i>

426
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,270
<i>Check the search history.
You're a tech guy, you know this.</i>

427
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,534
Saint Benedict's Hospital?
This is where Theo is?

428
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,239
- <i>I'm blinking. Yes.</i>
- That what you're saying?

429
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,331
He better be okay.

430
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,959
Yeah.

431
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,293
No police.

432
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,046
No fucking help.

433
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:44,133
You deserve what Natalie got
a hundred times over, neighbor.

434
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,180
Enjoy whatever Love does to you.

435
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,477
What are you even doing?

436
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,146
The weak spot will reveal itself.

437
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,358
- Weak spots always do.
- Okay.

438
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,029
Maybe we should talk about
what I said when Love was here.

439
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,823
I admire it.

440
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm over here trying to save us both
and you've got strategy.

441
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,416
Will you leave the wall alone?

442
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,499
No.

443
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,753
Because whether you love me
or even respect me,

444
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,381
I can figure out a simple cage.

445
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:28,720
I hacked my body. I hacked the shit
out of our marriage. I can hack this.

446
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,145
What was so bad about our marriage?

447
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,855
What are you talking about?

448
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,149
You hack everything.

449
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,942
Ovulation, child-rearing.

450
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,652
Sure. To get it right.

451
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,572
- To be good enough for you.
- That's hilarious.

452
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,573
I mean it!

453
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,451
Or have you forgotten
that you were a golden boy

454
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,537
and I was this uptight grad student
in huge glasses

455
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,415
- who your mom hated.
- My mom hates everyone.

456
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,335
And I loved you in those glasses.

457
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:06,591
I've loved every version of you, Sherry.

458
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,512
Everything I've done
since the day I laid eyes on you...

459
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,223
it was for you.

460
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,393
- Guess I'm an idiot.
- You're not.

461
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,022
- You're not.
- You know, Sherry,

462
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,774
until I met you,

463
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,985
I had massive inflammation,

464
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,197
undiagnosed lactose intolerance,

465
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,783
and I did coke every weekend.

466
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,912
I was just powering through
until I met you

467
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,538
and I saw,

468
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,875
she's together, she is optimized.

469
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,545
She is so much smarter than me.

470
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,629
Honey...

471
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,842
I didn't fall in love with you
'cause you were smart.

472
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,221
Ow, ow.

473
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,014
Oh, sweetie.

474
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,349
Come here, come here.

475
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,185
That's okay.

476
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,813
That's okay.

477
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,942
- The truth came out.
- No, no, I wasn't even...

478
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,777
You are smart.

479
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,488
I just mean, I fell for...

480
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,866
sweet and brave...

481
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,995
slay-any-dragon...

482
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,125
smart-enough-to-know-that-I'm-smarter-
but-you-don't-mind-that.

483
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,254
I love that.

484
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,425
You're the best dad to the best kids.

485
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,677
And don't forget 6% body fat.

486
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,638
You're down to...? Jesus.

487
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,184
When we get out of here,
you're gonna have all the burgers.

488
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,438
And you'll be the hottest
one-eared bitch in Madre Linda.

489
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,330
Hey.
I'm gonna put him to bed, he's asleep.

490
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,591
<i>This is not
how I imagined this ending.</i>

491
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,176
<i>Us ending.</i>

492
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,926
<i>Me.</i>

493
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,519
Perfect. I got here just in time.

494
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,105
Okay.

495
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
Don't you worry, Joe.

496
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,527
It's gonna be over real soon.

497
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,915
Oh, hey, I...

498
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,959
Got a text from Joe? That was me.

499
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,337
Come in?

500
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,175
- Yeah, no. I should...
- If you have any self-respect,

501
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,135
you'll come in,
so we can speak like adults.

502
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,599
Okay, sure.

503
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,275
<i>Don't fall for it.
She's gonna kill you.</i>

504
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,152
We'll only have this conversation once.

505
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,864
But I need to know,
of all the men in Madre Linda,

506
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,199
why my husband?

507
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,828
Fuck. He told me
that you two are separating...

508
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,163
He did? Oh. That's news to me.

509
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,916
- I am sorry. What?
- He lied.

510
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,253
<i>Get out. Get out.</i>

511
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,089
I'm so sorry. I...

512
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,425
He told me you two were splitting. I...

513
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,219
I really never would have...

514
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,681
Look, I'm... I'm a good person.

515
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,933
Or maybe I'm not, but I am trying.

516
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,102
You didn't answer my question.

517
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,437
Why Joe?

518
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,525
Was he kind to you?

519
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
Effortlessly get you?

520
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,659
Smart? Deep?

521
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
Good father material?

522
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,831
Yes.

523
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,711
- At first.
- What's that supposed to mean?

524
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,045
I should've trusted my gut.

525
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,299
Something in me knew
that it was too good to be true,

526
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,382
but I just...

527
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,010
He convinced me.

528
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,888
I let him convince me.

529
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,601
I used to think that toxic men looked
at me and saw an easy mark.

530
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,144
And I've looked at myself...

531
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
and something in me
that's attracted to toxicity.

532
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,401
<i>No, don't throw yourself under the bus.</i>

533
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,986
<i>She's distorting things.</i>

534
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,030
"Toxic"?

535
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,159
What if I told you
Joe's the one who killed your ex?

536
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,038
No, Ryan was...

537
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,790
No, Ryan was mugged.

538
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,085
Uh-huh.

539
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,632
Why would...?

540
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,009
- Why would Joe...?
<i>- To protect you.</i>

541
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,344
Because he's obsessed with you.

542
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,180
<i>No, I saved you. I did a good thing.</i>

543
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,557
When he's obsessed with someone,
he'll do anything.

544
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,808
I should know.

545
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,853
He was obsessed with me...

546
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,105
until he met you.

547
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,565
Mom?

548
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,151
- Hey.
- I have to pee.

549
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,487
Okay, sweetie. I'm almost done, okay?

550
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,030
Give me five minutes.

551
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,618
Oh, you know what?
You can go use the restroom down the hall.

552
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,701
Yeah.

553
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,331
Yeah. Okay.

554
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,540
Come on, baby.

555
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,711
Hi.

556
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,465
Go straight in there,
around the corner.

557
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,262
<i>Look this way. Look. Come on.</i>

558
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,263
<i>Shit.</i>

559
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,772
Marienne?

560
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,567
Um...

561
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,072
You... and your beautiful daughter,
you need to run.

562
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,866
Disappear.

563
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,785
Ryan's the beginning of what he'll do.

564
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,578
<i>Say you don't believe her.</i>

565
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,081
<i>Say you love me, you trust me.</i>

566
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,709
Then why aren't you running too?

567
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,546
It's not that simple for me.

568
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,588
No.

569
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,844
Okay, listen to me,
maybe it's not my place,

570
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:29,223
but maybe you think you owe it to your kid
or you're clinging to when things worked,

571
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,767
but, please, if there is ever...

572
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,438
even for a fleeting moment,

573
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,481
a tiny voice in your head,

574
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,359
and that tiny voice is telling you,
"I deserve better"...

575
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,695
listen to her.

576
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,698
That's your partner.

577
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,659
That's your real, true love.

578
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,913
And if you betray her long enough,
you will lose her.

579
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
Trust me, I'm still trying
to get mine back.

580
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,592
Mom?

581
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,554
Hey, baby.

582
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,056
Hey.

583
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,809
- Thank you.
- Of course.

584
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,984
You ready? Okay, come on.

585
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,862
<i>Did you believe Love's lies?</i>

586
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,615
<i>You knew it was a trap.
You would've said anything to get out.</i>

587
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,869
<i>A luxury I don't seem to have.</i>

588
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,127
I'd see why you like her.

589
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,712
Tough.

590
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,424
She's got a cute kid.

591
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,595
I can't believe I almost took
that little girl's mother away from her.

592
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,515
The insanity you drive me to, Joe.

593
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,435
Marienne's gonna be fine. More than fine.

594
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,979
She really makes being
a single mother look good.

595
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,689
Noble.

596
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,114
I barely recognize myself anymore.

597
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,449
I was so...

598
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,327
excited.

599
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,704
To be a mother.

600
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,083
And your wife.

601
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,378
And as soon as I became that...

602
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,589
you punished me for it.

603
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,804
I mean, you gaslit me so fucking hard.

604
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,224
I started to question...

605
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,936
every single thing about myself.

606
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,074
But that little voice
in the back of my head

607
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,453
that I've been suppressing
this whole fucking time, it was right.

608
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,751
I'm not the problem.

609
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,255
My husband is the problem.

610
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,350
<i>Aconite, when injected directly,</i>

611
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,812
<i>burns as it moves
through the system to the heart.</i>

612
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,564
<i>Think less slow paralysis,</i>

613
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,192
<i>more total fucking agony.</i>

614
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,652
<i>I'm sorry it had to come to this.</i>

615
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,198
Did you really think
that I wouldn't start to wonder...

616
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,036
what you were growing in the garden?

617
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,958
Wolf's-bane.

618
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,085
- A paralytic.
- No.

619
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,504
It slows the heart.

620
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,756
So I Googled antidotes.

621
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,467
Turns out, I needed biohacking.
Adrenaline.

622
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,178
And who doesn't have that
around here, right?

623
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,931
A little voice in my head
told me to take it.

624
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,684
Before you played your hand.

625
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,734
Joe...

626
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,862
You did this to yourself.

627
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,578
And the hardest part was making
the dose because I couldn't lie to myself.

628
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,290
<i>It had to be enough.</i>

629
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,086
I had to finally stop you.

630
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,881
We're perfect for each other.

631
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,425
But bad...

632
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,346
for Henry.

633
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:44,061
He'll know what you are.

634
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,169
Those sadistic, tacky,
Los Angeles, little bitches.

635
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,842
Hey.

636
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,011
Hey, don't give up on me, baby.

637
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,971
No, baby. Give me a flag, Cary.

638
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,681
Cary, give me a flag!

639
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,647
Sexy.

640
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,611
No!

641
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,112
No, no, no!

642
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,615
No, we're not letting them win, baby. No!

643
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,450
They'll turn on each other.

644
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,910
Those two-faced, vanilla pieces of shit.

645
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,418
There's a key in here.

646
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,005
Those freaky bitches
don't trust each other.

647
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,341
Baby, they're the weak spot.

648
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,759
They're the weak spot.

651
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,226
<i>But what if Love was right?</i>

652
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,896
<i>Maybe she will take the fall
for this whole mess,</i>

653
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,397

655
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,526

656
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>After Dottie's meltdown,
Love drew up papers</i>

657
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:22,534
<i>to prevent the Quinns from ever getting
near him, but if not them or me, then...</i>

658
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,121
<i>I can't let him get put
somewhere like I was.</i>

659
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,758
Jacob?

660
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,134
Jakey, let's go.

661
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,100
Such a nice day, right?

662
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,354
There's nothing I'd rather do
than be with you, buddy.

663
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,365
Done?

664
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,618
Oh, my God.

665
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,915
- Joey? How did you find...?
- Do you hate me?

666
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,876
- What?
- You think I'm bad.

667
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,628
What I did.

668
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,299
- Joey...
- Mom, what's wrong with me?

669
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,224
I know you try so hard to be good.

670
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,521
Then why'd you leave me there?

671
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,484
And why are you taking care of him?

672
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,153
I just...

673
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,575
I made too many mistakes.

674
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,704
And even though I loved you,
still love you...

675
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,707
I was hurting you too.

676
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,089
Sometimes we need to start over, Joey.

677
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Completely.

678
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,888
<i>I didn't have good parents.</i>

679
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,891
<i>But I know what a good parent does.</i>

680
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,851
<i>Protect.</i>

681
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,396
<i>Even if that means protecting from.</i>

682
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,774
I'm sorry.

683
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,151
I'm so sorry.

684
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,445
This isn't forever.

685
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,034
I love you more than anything.

Hey.

687
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,791
I don't know what to say.

688
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,635

00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:11,891
<i>Somehow,
Sherry and Cary made it out alive.</i>

797
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,145
<i>Their first move: use Sherry's blog
to savage Love Quinn</i>

798
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,647
<i>and turn themselves
into the real heroes of the story.</i>

799
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,608
<i>Their next move: write a book, of course.</i>

800
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:24,863
Caged: A Radical Couple's
Therapy Technique.

801
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,783
<i>As for you,</i>

802
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,743
<i>Marienne,</i>

803
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,914
<i>I looked for you,
but you and Juliette were already gone.</i>

804
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,167
<i>Phone number changed,
no forwarding address.</i>

805
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,128
<i>The end of our story remains unwritten.</i>

806
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,840
<i>Did you pity me
when you read what happened?</i>

807
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,594
<i>Did it erase the fear she planted?
Do you still think about us?</i>

808
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,513
Can't believe how many people left
New York after the pandemic.

809
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,640
Way before that. The election?

810
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:57,145
<i>But I have to believe
our paths are destined to cross again.</i>

811
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,335
<i>Marriage almost ruined both of us,
but we escaped.</i>

812
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,338
<i>Maybe the scars in our hearts
make them stronger.</i>

813
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,421
Nick!

814
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,091
Nick?

815
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,484
<i>All I know, </i>mon amour...

816
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,865
<i>is I'll search the world if I have to.</i>

817
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,786
<i>I will find you.</i>
