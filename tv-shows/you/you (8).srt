1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,844
Previously on You...

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,095
Stay away from Paco, because if you don't,

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,264
I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,727
You were right. I kicked Ron out.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,061
People don't change.

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,646
Who is that?

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,899
Rude to stare,
especially in Asian cultures.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,362
Benjamin J. Ashby.
This guy is everything wrong with America.

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,033
Your friends are disloyal.
And that Peach is the worst.

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,411
How many guys will do anything
for the person they love?

11
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,623
I just want you to live your best life.
And the cost was a corpse.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,916
You can talk about her.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,003
Actually, I think
I'd rather save it for therapy.

14
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,797
It's a bit troubling when
your partner hides something from you.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,716
Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?

16
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,551
I hear you, Paul.

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,970
If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

18
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,013
We're over.

19
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,222
What happened?

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,891
My girlfriend dumped me.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
It's been three months
since I lost you, Beck,

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,364
and it was a loss.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,867
But I'm in a new place. A better place.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,869
I'm with Karen Minty.

25
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,622
My little neat freak. Literally.

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,417
How you can live with these
un-alphabetized, I cannot understand.

27
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,586
Any other system is just hostile.

28
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,925
What are you waiting for, babe?

29
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,259
Again? I don't know if--

30
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,221
No, pervert. Grab the typewriter.

31
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,722
She keeps me guessing.

32
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,725
She's equal parts neat and freak.

33
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,310
Holy shit.

34
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,939
I'm happy. She's happy.

35
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,733
We're good for each other.

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,238
Okay, she's not perfect.

37
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,615
You know, with a Kindle,

38
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,119
you can store a zillion more stories
and recipes,

39
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,204
and there are zero dust mites.

40
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,664
Oh, yeah? Your show's back on.

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, Queens!

42
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,670
Yes, King of Queens.
Nobody's perfect.

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,215
We don't share everything,
but we share the right things.

44
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,968
The truth is, Beck, I don't miss you

45
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,720
the way I thought I would.
Not since Karen.

46
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,347
And you, you're doing great.

47
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,227
Your essay about Peach went viral.
You got a book deal. Good for you.

48
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,605
I hardly look at your Facebook.
Two or three times a day max.

49
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,277
No checking your email.
I don't go by your place.

50
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,408
Old me would've spent
the rest of the night

51
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,451
trying to hunt down Mr. Anonymous,

52
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,453
but you're not my job anymore.

53
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,456
This is my job now, and I love it.

54
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,503
For the most part.

55
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,050
- What an asshole.
- I know, right?

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm not saying
I deserve all this attention,

57
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,930
but "an overrated mess" is pretty harsh.

58
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,308
Wait. What?
I'm talking about Peach's deathbook.

59
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,311
This dude claiming
that she ghosted him at Coachella.

60
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
Where were you?

61
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,606
I had to check my comments.

62
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,107
Really?

63
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,901
Sorry I'm late, Rebecca.

64
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,362
There was this essay in The Believer
that would not let go of me.

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,489
Beck's not short for Rebecca.

66
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,037
Oh, it's a joke.
As if my last name was short for Rebecca.

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,081
Guinevere, short for Rebecca,
what did Janice say?

68
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,875
Who's Janice?

69
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,585
She's my editor.

70
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,052
Just call me this weekend, Beck.

71
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:52,440
"You do not sound like you.
I am not in love with these pages."

72
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,568
No wonder you needed me, Becky.

73
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,908
You make your own Yaddo.

74
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,912
This is no longer your home.
This is your writer's colony.

75
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:10,124
Kill all distractions.
Surrender thy phone.

76
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,502
My phone? Blythe...

77
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,130
Come on.

78
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,842
Goodbye, Instagram.

79
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,137
So long, Facebook.

80
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,598
Goodbye, Twitter.

81
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,809
I'm freeing your mind.

82
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,646
I can't just go dark, out of nowhere.

83
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,150
You're not J.K. Rowling.
We'll all be fine if you take a time-out.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,532
Not my router! What about research?

85
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,869
And I'm going to ask Ethan
where Joe gets all his typewriters,

86
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,206
so you can be the most analog princess
in all the land.

87
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,583
Hey, how is Joe?

88
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,877
Are we really going to do that?

89
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,715
No, I would never want to... you know.

90
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,343
Yes.

91
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,888
Yes, just put it all on the page.

92
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,932
Let it flow.

93
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,312
I was just curious if he was still with...
Is it Karen?

94
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,564
-What's her last name again?
-Minty.

95
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,481
Minty.

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,983
Yaddo.

97
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,111
Minty. Yaddo.

98
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,908
So you don't find
yourself thinking of Renaldo at all?

99
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,036
No. No, that's the thing.

100
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,874
Yeah, he dragged me into so many messes.

101
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:37,462
With Brad, I don't have to clean up
any messes. There are no messes.

102
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,048
-He is--
-Simple?

103
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,800
No. No, he's not. No, he's just...

104
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,635
He knows who he is,

105
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,388
which means I don't have to
drive myself crazy watching his back.

106
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,140
-In fact, I have all this free time now--
-Crap.

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,228
We're out of time.
We'll pick this up next week?

108
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,733
Yes. Therapy. Karen.
This is all working.

109
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,569
There's many ways
to the top of the mountain, Paul.

110
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,116
Maybe Brad's what you need.
Maybe Brad's your Sherpa.

111
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,744
Enjoy the ride, man.

112
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,206
Maybe Dr. Nicky
is on to something, Beck.

113
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,876
Karen doesn't expose me to toxic people
like Benji or Peach.

114
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,087
Dealing with them was, ugh, stressful.

115
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,798
Trying to make sure
you were okay all the time...

116
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,051
Fine, so I still do need to know
if you're okay.

117
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:29,222
I'm happy. I want you to be happy.
It's what happy people want for people.

118
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,434
What the hell? No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

119
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,519
Where did you go?

120
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,563
How the hell am I supposed to be great
with you being gone

121
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,731
if you're actually gone?

Desperate Characters. Number Seven?
Is that all I am to you?

135
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,851
You get a book deal because of me,
because, let's face it, Peach died.

136
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,686
And you wrote about her death.

137
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,772
And that's just not something
you would have done if she were alive.

138
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,858
I was so damn happy with Karen.

139
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,777
But I'm not sure I can be happy
if I don't know you're happy.

140
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,112
- What? Yes!
- Yeah.

141
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,656
- Yes!
- Yes! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

142
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,699
Joe!

143
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,495
This is on you, Beck.
You put Blythe and Ethan together

144
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,788
and you left me to deal with them.

145
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,291
The most spectacular thing
just happened for us.

146
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,794
We're moving in together.
Ethan just asked me. Just right now.

147
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,215
I mean, you know what they say.
When you know, you know.

148
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:31,177
Inspiration calls. Goodbye, love.

149
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,809
You are insane to move in with her
this quickly. You barely know her.

150
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,479
I don't know.
I mean, you love who you love,

151
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,648
and love tells you what to do. Easy peasy.

152
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,107
Stupid, stupid.

153
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,985
You just... You don't always know
how it's gonna work out.

154
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,489
Sure you do.
Look how happy you are with Karen.

155
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,242
Well, good luck finding a place.
The market's shit right now.

156
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,411
Okay, I'm not worried.
The law of attraction. When you know...

157
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,498
I know.

158
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,093
If I could go anywhere, I'd probably go
to New Zealand, to see Mordor.

159
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
When you know, you know.

160
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,057
I would go to Paris. Paris all the way.
Wouldn't have to think about it.

161
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,476
What about you, Joe?

162
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,896
Yeah, I've never been to Paris.

163
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm going to Six Flags this weekend.
Have you guys been there?

164
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,071
Six Flags? Really, Pac?

165
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,615
Mom's a new person since Ron's gone.

166
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,744
Sorry, sorry. I get in the elevator,
and we stop on every single floor.

167
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,414
I'm telling you, it was like,
12, 11, 10...

168
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,423
Is this Italian? Yeah, no, thanks.

169
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,757
Hey, Claudia?

170
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,136
You should put something in your stomach,
you know? Something else?

171
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,431
What's that supposed to mean?

172
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,891
I'm not the bad guy here.

173
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,980
Hijo, Mami changed her mind. We're going.
Let's go. Grab what you want.

174
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,025
Bye.

175
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,318
See you, Pac.

176
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,240
At least now we know she's on something.

177
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,619
I'm sorry I ruined dinner.

178
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,579
Serves me right for trying to help.

179
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,997
No, Karen.

180
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,460
You are so good.

181
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,254
You, too, babe.

182
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,926
"Babe." You said "babe" was
a default for unimaginative lovers.

183
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,013
But then, you never cared for people
the way Karen does.

184
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,308
You were so caught up in you,
you never thought to take care of me.

185
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,435
And honestly? It's worth all the "babe."

186
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:49,315
This is too sad. You wanna take a walk
to a Froyo truck or something?

187
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,777
Froyo sounds lovely.

188
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,741
For me, it's like,
just how present he is, you know?

189
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,076
-It speaks volumes about his heart.
-I know.

190
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,495
-He just looks you right in the--
-Reading Lord of the...

191
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,468
Joe! I, uh...

192
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,639
-Right. This is your hood.
-Right.

193
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,061
I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Beck.

194
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,105
Karen.

195
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,942
-Congrats on the book deal.
-Thanks.

196
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,028
I'm actually having some writer's block.

197
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,572
Thought I'd take a walk around the block.

198
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,074
You live near here?

199
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,246
No, I just... I like it around here.

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,543
I'm listening to that podcast
you told me about--

201
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:55,506
Podcasts. The droning.
Just get to the point, you know?

202
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,429
-Yeah...
-Babe, I'm starving.

203
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,015
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's...
Walk safe, Beck.

204
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,517
You, too!

205
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,311
Bye, Karen.

206
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,041
Ugh. Hello?

207
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,335
"Walk around the block."

208
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,420
You thought you'd disappear

209
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,924
and I'd show up at your door
screaming how I can't live without you.

210
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,220
Well, take a look, babe. This is me,
living without you. I don't need you.

211
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,638
Wait, hold up.

212
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,057
Hey, that was
the everythingship girl, right?

213
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,311
Ex-everything. Yeah.

214
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:58,152
What? No. I'm coming in tomorrow night,
and she is taking over for tonight. Yes.

215
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,570
- What can I get for you?
- Hi.

216
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,740
Oh, no. I know before I know.

217
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,287
I should delete you.

218
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,706
I'm with Karen, and you're right.
She is nice.

219
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,875
I should ignore you. I will.

220
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,338
Oh. Damn.

221
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,635
So, you're talking to Joe again?

222
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,554
Not talking. Just texting.

223
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
How much?

224
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,269
Couple times.

225
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,646
A day.

226
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
All right, you want me to give you
shrink bullshit

227
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,194
like, "how does that make you feel?"

228
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,363
Or do you wanna get real about this

229
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,324
and admit this is something you do,
and we should take a real look at it?

230
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm not falling for Renaldo.
I'm not going down that road again.

231
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,746
Are you trying
to convince me of that or you?

232
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,456
No. It's...

233
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,334
It's innocent. I bumped into him.

234
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,795
I could tell that he missed me, so I...

235
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,589
I texted him. To be nice.

236
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,301
Okay. Walk me through this,
will you, Paul?

237
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,136
Now, Renaldo sends you the first text,

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,599
and you know this is already something
that you've put to bed, and?

239
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,066
Congrats again.

240
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,987
Also, the asshole on Medium
who called you overrated? Just jealous.

241
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,451
So, do you want to see
my potential author photos?

242
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,417
I suppose I am an expert.

243
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,004
Here I come.

244
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,930
Friends.

245
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,975
Just friends.

246
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,518
So what are you reading right now?

247
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,526
I haven't opened it up yet.
Have you?

248
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,237
I have been there
and it didn't work out.

249
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,448
To say the least. We know this.

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,543
Sounds to me
like you're flirting.

251
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm not flirting with him.

252
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,046
He's with the wrong girl.

253
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,258
I mean, his new girlfriend, she's...
She puts stickers on pictures.

254
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,302
And they've been together
three months, right?

255
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,471
I mean, her profile, her life?

256
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,224
It's all bachelorette parties
and fortune cookies and blood...

257
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,851
blood drives.

258
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
What if Joe likes those things?

259
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,480
They're not Joe things.

260
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,316
The one thing I know from sitting
in this chair all these years

261
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,236
is that the only people
that know a relationship to the core

262
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,614
are the people
that are in that relationship.

263
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,783
Well, if that's true,

264
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,745
then why don't I know what's going on
with Brad and me?

265
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,958
Last week, I was happy.

266
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,543
This week, I'm comparing everything.

267
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:06,632
Like, um, Brad calls me "babe."

268
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,636
All right? Renaldo and I used to make fun
of people who say "babe."

269
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,889
Now I'm babe? Like,
how does one just become babe?

270
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:19,937
I'm gonna give you a metaphor, okay?
Think of your relationship as a house.

271
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
And that's Brad and me.

272
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,441
There's a mouse in that house.

273
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,235
I'm the mouse?

274
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,030
Well, I'm not one of those people
who would ever kill a mouse.

275
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,492
No, you're not going to.
You're gonna focus on your house.

276
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,285
The house that you built for you and Brad.

277
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,246
Forget about the mouse.
The mouse is a pest.

278
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,584
Okay, so, as the mouse, I'm just supposed
to walk away? Leave the alleged house?

279
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,506
So, that's it. Just stop texting.

280
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,967
Brad is good for me.
I like the house, our house.

281
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,261
Yeah. I think you
do like your house, Paul.

282
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,016
But what if I know for a fact
this man wants this mouse?

283
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,600
Maybe he does.

284
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,021
How do people catch mice?

285
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,732
In a trap.

286
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,234
And isn't one of the reasons
why you guys fell apart

287
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,153
is because he made you feel...

288
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,240
Trapped. Oh, come on.

289
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm just saying, I could metaphor
circles around you all day long.

290
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,078
I have great metaphors.

291
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,791
But I think you know
what I'm driving at, Beck.

292
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,299
Law of attraction.

293
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,427
Ethan and Blythe scored a place
the day they went looking.

294
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,472
So, they bask in the knowledge
that the universe is on their side,

295
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,142
and I get roped into a quote,
moving party, end quote,

296
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,603
which is not a thing.

297
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,397
Note to self. Make new friends.

298
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,774
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

299
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,525
-Sorry I'm late.
-You're kidding me.

300
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,360
-Let me help you with that.
-Oh, it's okay. I got it.

301
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,072
Of course no one mentioned
you were coming.

302
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,783
The last time I saw you in that shirt...

303
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,786
Blythe didn't tell you
she blackmailed me into this?

304
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,455
...you were bent over
the bookstore counter at 2:00 a.m.

305
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,499
I'm not thinking about that.

306
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,377
And suddenly I miss texting,

307
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,839
because you in the actual room
does things to me that I can't control.

308
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,509
-Is Karen here?
-She's working.

309
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,101
♪ Something tells me
Mine is not the first... ♪

310
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,396
Yes, you smell good.
Your heat. Your sweat.

311
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,692
But Karen brings out the best in me
and you bring out the worst.

312
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,197
Your knees, your legs.
They're just knees. They're just legs.

313
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,033
♪ You're power trippin' ♪

314
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,495
♪ Yeah ♪

315
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,915
♪ You're power trippin' now ♪

316
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,628
♪ You're power trippin' ♪

317
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,296
Hey.

318
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,384
Oh, thanks.

319
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,719
Apparently we've been invited

320
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,265
to the Swedish word
for a housewarming party on Thursday.

321
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,976
You know, I have to admit
I had my initial doubts about them,

322
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,978
but they're adorable together.

323
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,313
Obnoxiously cute.

324
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,235
Cheers.
To the Joe and Beck moving company.

325
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,362
We may be just okay...

326
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,072
But we work for free.

327
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,414
How's writing going?

328
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,543
Harder than I thought.

329
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,547
Well, that's true of all things in life
that are good for you. Don't you think?

330
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,885
Like moving a whole house of tasteful,
yet surprisingly heavy furniture?

331
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,053
No, you know what I mean.

332
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:48,353
So, have you been to Staten Island yet?
You know, to meet the Mintys?

333
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,147
You looked me up.

334
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,815
I guess that means
that you're back on Facebook.

335
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,818
Which means you noticed I was off.

336
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,823
Hey, I am just looking out for my friend.

337
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,619
Babe.

338
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,375
Babe. You had to do it?

339
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,219
Claudia, honey, can you hear me?
Claudia?

340
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:26,850
Ugh, she's completely out of it.
Hand me that blood pressure cuff.

341
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,436
Girl, what did you do?

342
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,356
What is this?

343
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,864
-Should we take her to a hospital?
-So she can lose her job? Hell no.

344
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,201
She could lose everything, Joe.
She could lose Paco.

345
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,956
She's not dying.
She's just very strung out.

346
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,126
She just needs a couple of days to detox.
Get out the woods.

347
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,129
And you know what?
She deserves that chance.

348
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,756
Addiction is a monster.

349
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,051
It doesn't care
if you're a good nurse, a good mother.

350
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,932
I don't want Paco to see this.

351
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,518
Do you get claustrophobic easily?

352
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,994
Quite the little detox dungeon
you got here.

353
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,371
Mooney would kill me for this.

354
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,915
Benji already destroyed ten grand
in inventory in here.

355
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,753
-You sure she's gonna be okay?
-I got this.

356
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,349
Uh-oh. She's waking up. In a cage.

357
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,686
- No! No, what are you doing to me?
- Hold her. Okay, Joe?

358
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,396
I would freak out, too.

359
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,772
Hold her down. I got a sedative.

360
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,274
- Hurry up, Karen.
- What are you doing?

361
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,317
- Hold her down.
- Let go of me!

362
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,234
- I'm trying to help you.
- No!

363
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,528
Like Benji freaked out.

364
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,364
Anyone would.

365
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:10,120
And he died in this cage.
His corpse was right here. I killed him.

366
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,209
I got you, girl.
I'll be here when you wake up.

367
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,713
Karen's got this. Claudia's not
gonna die in this cage, like Benji.

368
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,631
Benji's body. The smell. I did that.

369
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,217
I'm not a killer. No one else
is dying in here. I'm not a killer.

370
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,136
-Jesus, Joe.
-I'm sorry.

371
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,721
I told you I got this.

372
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,266
Sorry, babe. Sometimes detox is messy.

373
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,605
Oh, Beck. She has no idea
how messy this could get.

374
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
They're still at the spa?

375
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,367
Yeah, you know how you love Six Flags?
Well, this is...

376
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,537
really just like their version
of Six Flags.

377
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,914
Are you telling the truth?

378
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,083
I wish I was telling the truth.

379
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,461
I'm always telling the truth.

380
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,341
I thought I was sleeping there.

381
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,009
Nah, you get the bed.

382
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,302
I do?

383
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,263
Thanks, Joe.

384
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,393
I hope she's having fun. Mom.

385
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,146
She is.

386
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,858
You know she loves you.

387
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,154
She always says
love is what really makes a family.

388
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,826
Well, if that's true,
then you can count me and Karen, too.

389
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,121
Which means I have the authority
to tell you to get to bed.

390
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,915
Get to bed, young sir.
Brush your teeth.

391
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,344
I got the ice chips.

392
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,390
Thank you. You're a godsend.
Here, honey.

393
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,772
You're gonna feel better soon, okay?

394
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,274
He's back.

395
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,609
He's back.

396
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,280
Who's he? What? Is she okay?

397
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,949
She thinks this place is haunted.

398
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,492
Impossible.

399
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,453
Benji was too lazy to run
his own business, let alone haunt mine.

400
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,832
There you go, honey. Let it go.

401
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,719
Hi, Ron. Can I help you?

402
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,472
I'm looking for Claudia.

403
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,558
Well, she's not here.

404
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,520
But you know where she is.

405
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,356
How the hell does he...
Oh, he doesn't. He's testing me.

406
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,733
I'm sorry, I don't.

407
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,402
Well, it's not like her
not to text me back.

408
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,200
She told me that you two broke up.

409
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,416
Is that what she said?

410
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,671
Not quite self-defense.

411
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,007
No one would believe
he was robbing the place.

412
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,009
A parole officer. Respectable.

413
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,969
Can't say he wouldn't deserve it.

414
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:18,308
I'll mention that you swung by
when I see her, if you'd like.

415
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,650
Thank you. You do that.

416
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,705
Karen has Claudia handled.
Karen sent me home.

417
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,416
Karen kind of doesn't need me.

418
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,632
Hey. Can I steal you
for an hour tomorrow,

419
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,008
maybe rent your brain?

420
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,386
I could use a reader and some sea breeze.

421
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,013
No. I shouldn't. I won't.

422
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,390
It's a date.

423
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,225
Shit! It's fine.

424
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,310
You're not heroin. You're a human woman.

425
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,189
We're friends. I have self-control.

426
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,066
And besides, what could happen

427
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,945
on the upper deck of an immensely popular
tourist destination?

428
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,259
In a word, wow.

429
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,720
It's such a relief to hear that.

430
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,848
I must have rewritten the end
a dozen times.

431
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,977
I've been in lock-down, torturing myself,
trying so hard.

432
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,563
I was starting to spin out, you know?

433
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,898
More than you realize, Beck.

434
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,276
The fresh air helps.

435
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,955
Karen is good.
I need to be good for Karen.

436
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,042
I think I'll write another one
from the male perspective.

437
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,959
Hmm.

438
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,713
Assuming I can procure your services
on an as-need basis.

439
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,175
Karen is good. I need to be good.

440
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,723
Let's give it a shot.
What do you think I'm thinking right now?

441
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,895
Please move further away.

442
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,563
Mmm... I think I know
what you're thinking.

443
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,773
Or move closer.

444
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,690
Yeah?

445
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,233
No, don't move closer.

446
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,568
I think...

447
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,657
you're thinking what I'm thinking.

448
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,659
We can't do this.

449
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,789
We're not gonna do this.
We are not doing this, Beck.

450
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,962
Well, that was a mistake.

451
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,090
-Never again.
-Ever.

452
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,396
Never again. Again.

453
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,569
Never again. Again.

454
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,113
Nicky, I'm so sorry,
but I have to cancel.

455
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,158
Don't worry.
I am very much not in that house anymore.

456
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,244
Nicky, my man, it's Paul.
Hey, what can I say?

457
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,289
Your advice worked wonders.
There's no mouse in my house.

458
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,626
You make me weak, Beck.

459
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
Karen's handling Claudia,

460
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,091
and I'm a bad person
because I'm letting her,

461
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,136
while I'm letting you handle me.

462
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,182
My neighbors are gonna hate me.

463
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,767
Paco.

464
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,101
Oh. Shit!

465
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,603
I was supposed to handle Paco.

466
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,022
You're a drug, Beck.
You're worse than pills.

467
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,982
I am worse than Claudia.

468
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,150
I gotta go.

469
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,153
-Wait, what did I do?
-I'm sorry. It's nothing.

470
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,363
All right.

471
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,284
Everything, Beck.
Once again, you swallow me whole.

472
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:50,371
You make me forget everything else,
and other people pay the price for it.

473
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,084
Oh! Pac, I'm sorry I'm late.
There's another showing, if you wanna go.

474
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,544
I wanna see my mom.

475
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,340
Stop lying. Where is she, Joe?

476
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,593
She's okay. I promise.
But trust me, you're better off here--

477
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,677
Don't say that.

478
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,931
You have no idea what's better.
She's my mom.

479
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:13,019
I do get it. Okay? I do.
My mom used to disappear all the time.

480
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:18,191
She had problems. All moms have...
All people have problems.

481
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:23,321
She just has to deal
with some stuff. Okay?

482
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,448
She's coming home as soon as she can.

483
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,826
She didn't say goodbye.

484
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,662
She always says goodbye.

485
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,588
Hey, I didn't know you were
coming back tonight. Where's Paco?

486
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,512
What are you thinking?
It's one more day. Two tops.

487
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,056
-He needed to see her.
-No, he didn't.

488
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,020
Mom.

489
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,440
Oh!

490
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,525
Baby.

491
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,736
Baby, I'm so sorry.

492
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,197
It's okay, Mom. You have to get better.

493
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,659
I swore I wasn't gonna get sick again
and then I did.

494
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,746
This is it. I'm gonna change.

495
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,750
I just need... I need a little while
to get my shit together,

496
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,421
and then I'm going home,
and I'm all yours, mijo.

497
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,257
It's okay.

498
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,926
It's okay.

499
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,104
I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to put on a kid.

500
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,566
I know. But he needed this.

501
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,197
All right, mister.
Take Paco home. Make him do his homework.

502
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,574
I'll stay here till she falls asleep.

503
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,660
Then I can meet you at
the housewarming party for a few minutes.

504
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,287
You want to go to that?

505
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,624
Blythe is... She's a little out there,
and Ethan's a talker.

506
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,917
I wouldn't be offended

507
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,585
-if it's not your scene.
-I wanna go.

508
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,255
I'm burnt out.
And this place is kind of creepy.

509
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,090
-No offense.
-Mmm.

510
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,509
None taken.

511
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,265
Personally, I'm of the opinion

512
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,561
that all penetration under patriarchy
is rape, and so before I...

513
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,648
Oh, Blythe. Beck, Blythe.
Are you here?

514
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,151
I've never wanted someone to appear
yet not appear so badly.

515
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,695
...in addition
to watching Beyoncé's Lemonade...

516
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,449
I'm a junkie. It's better to just
not have access to a fix.

517
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,162
My methadone. Thank God.

518
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,457
...had to hire a literal homeless person,
off the street, to help us move it.

519
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,000
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

520
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,004
You must be Blythe.

521
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,132
I am, because I must.

522
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,342
Blythe!

523
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:55,932
Percival! Back from the ashram.
Tell me everything. How was it?

524
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,268
Isn't that Beck?

525
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:06,442
Oh. Beck and a bottle of booze.
What could go wrong?

526
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,735
Yes.

527
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,742
Little Karen Minty, how are you?

528
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,455
I mean, uh...
Sorry, I mean little as a compliment.

529
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,377
I'm sorry.
I've had a few.

530
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,421
Cheers to that, lady.

531
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,757
Hey, uh, can you help me
open a couple of bottles?

532
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,468
I have butterfingers,
'cause earlier I was touching butter.

533
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,015
If I leave them alone,
they'll talk about me.

534
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,893
Christ, babe, go. If you don't leave,
we can't talk about you.

535
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,196
Hmm.

536
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,158
- He's such a good guy, right?
- The best.

537
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,662
My heart just fills up
when I see him with Paco.

538
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,707
Most guys don't give a shit, but Joe...

539
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,129
Joe will do absolutely anything
for someone he loves.

540
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,214
The heart in him, you know?

541
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,141
I'm so happy for you guys.
Will you, uh, excuse me?

542
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,732
What did Karen tell you?
What did you tell Karen?

543
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,984
Leaving you alone together was a bad idea.

544
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,403
Hey.

545
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,075
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

546
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,576
Stop.

547
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,703
Do you think either of us can stop?

548
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,872
What we're doing is wrong.

549
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,082
But...

550
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:48,628
I didn't get it, but now I see it.
I really see it.

551
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,963
See what?

552
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:56,511
You are so good for me.
I mean, you helped me so much, and...

553
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,681
you're the best thing that ever happened
to my writing, which is everything.

554
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,641
But...

555
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:06,229
But the world is twisted, and unfair,
and let's face it...

556
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,606
I am no good for you.

557
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,027
But Karen Minty is.

558
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,571
And I am jealous.

559
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,407
And I wish I did things differently.

560
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,993
I wish I hadn't shut down
after Peach died.

561
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:25,206
And I hadn't pushed you away.
But, I think it...

562
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,587
It came from how scared I was to need you.

563
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,217
But...

564
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:44,183
I am a mess,
and you deserve better.

565
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:49,522
You deserve to be with someone
who's perfect for you.

566
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,899
You're right.

567
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,429
Thank you.

568
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,806
No thanks needed.

569
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,705
You're right, Beck.
Karen is good for me.

570
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,790
And we just saved someone's life together.

571
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,585
That alone should tell me
I'm in the right place.

572
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,837
Karen is perfect.

573
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,398
It's over.

574
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,069
-No, it's just a commercial.
-No, no, no, no, no.

575
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,071
Our it. Us.

576
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,453
You're dumping me.

577
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,082
No, I'm not dumping you. You're amazing.

578
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,793
I'm amazing, but you kind of, what,
don't wanna do me anymore?

579
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,964
Look, there's never a good time to--

580
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,465
Do not talk for a minute, please.

581
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:55,106
We're a good team. I see that.
I just... There's something missing.

582
00:37:55,189 --> 00:38:00,152
I don't know what it is.
I wish I could buy it.

583
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:04,323
I wish I could buy it at the store
and take it home. But I can't.

584
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,370
Oh, she's gonna slap me.

585
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,998
My curling iron.

586
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,501
No? Okay.

587
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,963
So, you're okay?

588
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,471
We're adults. It happens.

589
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,099
I'm not stupid, okay?
I knew something was off.

590
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,977
- Now she's gonna slap me.
- Oh.

591
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,482
Uh, I mean, maybe we should talk?

592
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
Okay, then.

593
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,614
That's it.

594
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,795
Of course she takes the high road.
She knew all along.

595
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,006
Karen and I don't see the world
the same way.

596
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,426
But you? You, Beck?

597
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,846
This is it.
This is that moment in the movie.

598
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,307
This is when I run through the rain
to win you back.

599
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,894
Okay, it's not raining,
but this is the run in the rain.

600
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,395
This is where I declare to you...

601
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,980
You got me, babe!

602
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,691
Beck!

603
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,576
No, I'm sorry.
I just... I meant to tap it.

604
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,286
I'm sorry.

605
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,579
What the hell, Joe?

606
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,373
I was thinking about what you said
at the party.

607
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,375
You're pushing me away
because you think it's the right thing.

608
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,168
It is. It's the right thing.

609
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,671
No, the right thing is to be with
who you should be with.

610
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,884
Even if it's messy. You make it work
because you know you belong together

611
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,345
and I know we belong together.

612
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,016
So, you tell me you know it, too...

613
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,437
and you got me.

614
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:10,116
Yes. Get up here.
But take the stairs.

615
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,804
The drama.

616
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,473
What are you gonna do next?

617
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,892
Torch the place
the next time we have a fight?

618
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,644
For you...

619
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
My dear, for you...

620
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,317
...the drama is worth it.

621
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,615
I got good news.

622
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,120
My editor loved my new pages.

623
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,543
I was so happy,
and all I wanted to do was call you.

624
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,920
And share it with you.

625
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,551
Well, it's a good thing
I showed up with that rock, then.

626
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,029
She's not gonna let you in, man.
You don't know what she's been through.

627
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,703
I heard you helped.

628
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,415
Thank you.

629
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,418
Hey.

630
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,260
This was never Ron's fault.

631
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,262
You can't be serious.

632
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,889
He helps us every day.

633
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,683
-You call that help?
-Yeah, I do.

634
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,645
-I can't do this alone.
-Claudia, you're not alone.

635
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,241
Karen was right.
Addiction is a monster.

636
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,119
You lied to me.

637
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,914
Paco, I didn't lie--

638
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,333
You said things would get better.

639
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,086
You said I had you and Karen--

640
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,214
-You do. Just because we're apart--
-Karen's gone!

641
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,550
She's switching jobs.

642
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,469
She's mad at my mom for Ron,
and we're never gonna see her again.

643
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,098
Well, that's not gonna last. I promise--

644
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,350
You can't promise!

645
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,853
You say you wanna help, but you can't!
Can you, Joe?

646
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
Everything is worse.

647
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,198
Hey. I needed to hear your voice.

648
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:01,120
In a totally non-obsessive,
casual sort of way. Call me, please.

649
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,207
Karen, hi.

650
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,419
Do you work around here?

651
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,755
No, just walking around the block.

652
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,760
I won't keep you.
I just had to say thank you.

653
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,762
I owe you.

654
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,056
For what?

655
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,726
Turns out you're my
get-out-of-Joe-free card.

656
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:29,273
You... You showed me who he really is.

657
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,649
And that is?

658
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,151
Besides a liar and a cheater?

659
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,486
I really have to go.

660
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,823
Of course. Just be careful.

661
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,910
I got a feeling you're no Candace.

662
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,580
Okay. What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

663
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,792
Hey, look, I couldn't fill in
the ex shoes either.

664
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,962
Whoever this girl is,
she's still got her claws in him.

665
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,637
Well, this has been fun.
You got to play the spiteful ex.

666
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,096
Now, let's just say goodbye.

667
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,560
Yeah, I'm sure you two will be fine.
Of course, you gotta know.

668
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,605
What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

669
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,607
Or worse.

670
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,943
Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

671
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,406
Enjoy it while it lasts, Beck.
