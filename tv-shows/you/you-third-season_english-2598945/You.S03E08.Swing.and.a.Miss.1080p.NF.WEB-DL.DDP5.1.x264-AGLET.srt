1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,580
I need to look at particular people
on particular dates.

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,983
I know Theo has a crush on me.
I could pretend like he had a chance.

4
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,611
Love's first husband asked for a divorce.
Next thing you know, he was dead.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>Look at you,
making the world more beautiful.</i>

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I will stay ahead of her this time.</i>

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,661
Cary and I are polyamorous.

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,498
And we would love to take
our relationship to a new level.

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,293
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,546
<i>Opening our marriage? This loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.</i>

11
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,214
No idea is too crazy.

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>For you.</i>

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,932
<i>Here's the thing, Marienne,</i>

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,062
<i>I'm a monogamist.
Some might even say a serial monogamist.</i>

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,566
<i>So imagine my surprise when my wife
suggested we read up on polyamory,</i>

16
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,445
<i>aka swinging, aka the lifestyle,</i>

17
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>aka a flatlining marriage's dying gasp.</i>

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,033
Is it mortifying?

19
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,412
Well...

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,831
"Happily ever after is a myth

21
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,708
because people are not static.

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,545
Our partners do not owe us a guarantee
that they will never change."

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,174
Okay. It's not crazy.

24
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,010
I'm gonna go check on Henry.
I think he'll wake up soon.

25
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>I'm leaving out the part where if
your marriage isn't on rock-solid footing,</i>

26
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>swinging is all but guaranteed to nuke it,</i>

27
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,646
<i>aka the dream.</i>

28
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>Still, after my conversation with Dottie
about the fate of Love's first husband,</i>

29
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,821
<i>I need to tread lightly.</i>

30
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>Be game but not too. Make it all her idea.</i>

31
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>The Love I first met was a free spirit.</i>

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,345
<i>Reality has disappointed her
since we moved to Madre Linda.</i>

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>I can make it easy to leave me,
no hard feelings, to go follow her bliss.</i>

34
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,271
I learned a new word. "Compersion."

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,397
Yeah?

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,111
Vicarious joy from seeing your partner
have joyful sexual relations with another.

37
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,696
Hm.

38
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,035
I don't know if this is a good idea.

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>Shit. Too game.</i>

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,081
I'm not sure
we're in a solid enough place.

41
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,292
<i>Okay, back off for a while.</i>

42
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,962
Can I ask you something?

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,341
Did you and James ever
do anything like this?

44
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,887
No, he wasn't much of a risk taker.

45
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,637
Plus...

46
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,975
we weren't very far
into our marriage when...

47
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,979
- Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to ask.
- No, it's fine.

48
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,440
James didn't really know what he wanted.

49
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,568
We were planning on having a baby,

50
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,154
and he got cold feet.

51
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,032
And then he got sick,

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,828
which was obviously very scary.

53
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,164
But he used it like a shield.

54
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:31,169
And I wasn't, like,
allowed to be mad. Ever.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,754
I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,340
<i>That my wife almost definitely
murdered her first husband.</i>

57
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,925
It's fine.

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,927
- I probably sound like an asshole.
- No.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,010
<i>Worse.</i>

60
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,555
<i>James let himself become
the villain of their story.</i>

61
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,183
<i>I cannot be the villain of ours.</i>

62
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,266
Listen.

63
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,897
I'm not going anywhere.
Let's not rush this swinging thing.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,980
It just...

65
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
It isn't me.

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,111
It isn't us.

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,740
<i>Which is exactly why we're going to do it.</i>

68
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey, Dante. You got a sec?

69
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,168
Hey, yeah. What's up?

70
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,252
Well...

71
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,340
If you don't mind me asking,
you and Lansing,

72
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,343
you guys have been together for how long?

73
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,511
Let's see.

74
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,848
We met when Lansing's boys were 3.
So 13 years.

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,434
Stop me if this is too personal.

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,563
Have you two always been monogamous?

77
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,066
Are you asking because I'm gay?

78
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,278
Oh, no. No, no, no. I...

79
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,488
I'm fucking with you.

80
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,784
And the answer is, technically, no.

81
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,910
Technically?

82
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,745
We tried a threesome once.

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,957
We'd been married a year
and our lives were just work,

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,709
kids, eat, sleep, repeat.

85
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,671
- But Lansing wanted to spice things up.
- How'd he convince you?

86
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,754
Didn't have to.

87
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,590
I love him so much.

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,803
I thought if this is what he wanted,
I should at least try it.

89
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,806
Just got off the phone with Amy Woodruff.

90
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,225
That name is familiar because...?

91
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,228
She edited every children's book
I'm obsessed with.

92
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
- Great.
- Oh, that's cool.

93
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,940
She was calling to congratulate me

94
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,943
on being a finalist
in her imprint's illustration contest...

95
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,946
- Congratulations.
- ...which I did not submit for.

96
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,992
But I seem to recall mentioning to you.

97
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,370
Yeah, yeah. Guilty, I...

98
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,831
I knew you wanted to submit, so...

99
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,166
Dante give us a sec.

100
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,423
Was I not clear?
You're a married man, we are not a thing.

101
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,092
No, we're friends. That's it.
But you missed the deadline

102
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,094
- for the last submission.
- I did.

103
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,557
Knowing how much
you beat yourself up over that, I just...

104
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,018
Decided to do it for me?

105
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,187
I decided to help
because I knew you would win.

106
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,439
The world should see your work.

107
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,692
They're my deadlines to miss.

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,696
Yeah, message received.

109
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,243
You're right. Listen, I'm not the type
of guy to go around sticking my nose in,

110
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,788
so I'm sorry.

111
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,372
Good.

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,462
- Can I go back to being excited now?
- Please.

113
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,635
Um, I've gotta...

114
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,220
- Fuck. Of course.
- Yep.

115
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,847
<i>Great. It's Madre Linda's
most respected drug fiend.</i>

116
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,434
<i>Your custody hearing is approaching
and suddenly I'm seeing a lot more of him.</i>

117
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,729
- Hi, Ryan.
- Well, you're in a good mood.

118
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,149
Yeah, it's, um, been nice having Juliette.

119
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,818
<i>Smart to keep good news from him.</i>

120
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,320
- So you ready for that thing on Friday?
- That thing?

121
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,449
Where you convince a judge that you're
not using our daughter to punish me?

122
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,413
I would've rather worked things out
like adults.

123
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,662
I thought that's what we were doing.

124
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,790
Juliette, time to go.

125
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,583
- Already?
- Don't argue.

126
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,212
Let me help you, baby.

127
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,214
<i>This is hard on your daughter.</i>

128
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,426
<i>I wish I could fix it.
I wanna fix everything for you.</i>

129
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,553
- Did you have fun? All right.
- Mm-hm.

130
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,479
Henry's down for the night.

131
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,191
Hey.

132
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,404
Come to bed.

133
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,949
<i>Mm. Trying to reignite the spark,</i>

134
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>and my move here is make it not so easy.</i>

135
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,797
Sorry.

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Long day.

137
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,344
Okay.

138
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,851
- How are we gonna get back to us?
- Love, I'm just tired.

139
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,269
Yeah. Or bored.

140
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,062
<i>So far, so good.</i>

141
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
- No, I'm... No, I...
- Maybe that's...

142
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,942
just what marriage does.

143
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,612
You know, I love us.

144
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,158
It's... But it's... It's known.
You know, I want a secret.

145
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,493
I wanna still be fun.

146
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,786
- You are fun.
- No, I mean, like, wild.

147
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,581
Like, you remember
those first few months we...

148
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,251
- You know?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,463
And now that's just over?

150
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,051
Because I'm a mom and a wife,

151
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,886
I can't be...?

152
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,681
Be honest.

153
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't Sherry and Cary seem
more interesting

154
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,646
now that we know they swing?

155
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,441
- I thought you didn't want to.
- I don't know what I want.

156
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,401
I got married so young.

157
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,363
There's a lot of things
I never got to try.

158
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:56,285
Well, the last thing I wanna do is stand
between you and anything you want.

159
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,454
<i>I have to guide her. Gently.</i>

160
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,166
Do you have any fantasies?

161
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,088
Like, did you ever experiment?

162
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,300
Okay, I made out drunkenly
with my college roommate, you know...

163
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,095
- Total cliché.
- Total.

164
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
See. Boring.

165
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,975
No, I'm kidding.
I haven't done any experimenting either.

166
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
- So you've never had a threesome?
- No.

167
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>Unless you count under the bed
with Peach Salinger and her drug dealer.</i>

168
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,940
You ever kiss a guy?

169
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,276
Would you?

170
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,323
Under the right circumstances,
I don't see why not.

171
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,161
Wow. Yeah, this is just fun
to talk about.

172
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,685
<i>Time to move to the next step.</i>

173
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:46,335
In all honesty, reading books is great.
But it does somehow feel clinical.

174
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,755
We could talk to the experts.

175
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,715
<i>Bull's-eye.</i>

176
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,135
I'm sure Sherry and Cary would be happy
to give us a walk-through.

177
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,429
I know you're not Sherry's biggest fan.

178
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>I'd rather fuck a cactus.</i>

179
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,766
We're talking strictly physical, right?

180
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,979
It would be with Cary.
Also strictly physical.

181
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,565
Yeah, I'm not threatened by Cary
in the slightest.

182
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,402
- We would just be asking them questions.
- Yeah, we're not committing to anything.

183
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,530
The nondisclosure is mandatory.

184
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,825
It's standard practice in a community
as tight-knit as ours.

185
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,744
So do you do a lot of these?

186
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,080
Can't confirm or deny but, I mean,

187
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,877
everyone in Madre Linda has tried
the lifestyle at some point.

188
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,089
<i>Huh. The burbs are even more
miserable than I thought.</i>

189
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,092
Um... I, um...

190
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,598
Aw, damn you.

191
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,018
Oh, yeah, those look worth fucking
my glycemic variability for.

192
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,645
Okay. Well...

193
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,356
- Mm.
- Here you go.

194
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:04,955
So, when you started the lifestyle,
were you two already in a good place?

195
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,626
Not as good as we are now.

196
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:14,548
Our marriage grew rock solid
through these little trust falls.

197
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,342
We can take you through a Q and A.

198
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,428
You know, no "presh,"
you'll see, the whole thing, it's very...

199
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
You're in control.

200
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,058
Great. Okay.

201
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,937
So let's just get started.
Obviously, STIs we should know about?

202
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,605
- No.
- Good.

203
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,732
Love, let's talk menstruation.

204
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,402
Um, I'm not due for another three weeks.

205
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,653
Cycle twins.

206
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,824
And our kids are at camp through August.

207
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,243
Okay, well, we...

208
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,995
We have a great babysitter.

209
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,083
Henry could stay
the night there if, you know...

210
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,961
<i>Suddenly this feels real.
They really are pros.</i>

211
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,756
Well, let's get to the fun stuff.
What are you comfy with?

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
Joe, start with an easy one.

213
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,263
Are you good
with Love and I getting physical?

214
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,348
Yeah.

215
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,767
Girl-on-girl, usually a given.

216
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,893
Love and Cary.

217
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,855
<i>I couldn't care less
but can't appear too game.</i>

218
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,605
I mean...

219
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,609
I trust you.

220
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,198
Love, are you good
with Joe and Cary fooling around?

221
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,282
Sure.

222
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,160
But... Are you...?

223
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,915
For the public,
the brand is conventional monogamy.

224
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,837
Some don't understand that
a bisexual man is a truly optimized man.

225
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,217
Okay, I can keep an open mind.

226
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,471
<i>For you, Marienne,
I will walk through fire.</i>

227
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,723
- What about Joe and me?
<i>- Seeing as Love killed</i>

228
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,926
<i>- the last woman I almost slept with...</i>
- That's a no.

229
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,603
- It's fine by me. What do you mean?
- I...

230
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,688
- Do you not want to?
- No, no, no. I thought...

231
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,898
Why?

232
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,109
- Because...
- Okay. Moving too fast.

233
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,779
- Yeah.
- Oh, what's happening?

234
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,822
We've been doing this a while,

235
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,200
and we can tell
when a foundation's a little shaky.

236
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,411
No shame, it's just you two are so...

237
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,872
young.

238
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,502
Hit us up if you get on the same page.

239
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,217
- What the fuck just happened?
<i>- A major setback.</i>

240
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,802
Miss Bellamy.

241
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,057
Let's talk about your day-to-day routine
with visitation.

242
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Who prepares your child's meals?

243
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:35,147
When Juliette's with me, I do.
When she's with Ryan, his mother does.

244
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,442
'Cause Juliette loves the taste
of unseasoned chicken.

245
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,362
<i>Even when you're practicing
for court, you're still delightful.</i>

246
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,281
Excellent. Don't say that last part.

247
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,117
How would you describe
your recovery from addiction?

248
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,330
- Well, I have my weekly meetings...
- Nope. In the four years since.

249
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,041
- Give me a second.
- She's doing really well.

250
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,459
She needs to be perfect.

251
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,920
I stand before you
with an Ivy League education

252
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,797
and two successful stepsons.

253
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,050
We have been trying to adopt
for three years.

254
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,094
There's always a snag.

255
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,512
I'm being hard on you

256
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,224
- because I know what you're up against.
- I know. I'm trying, I just...

257
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,685
The fucker is plotting something,
and I can feel it.

258
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,855
We'll get there. Keep practicing.

259
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,941
Thank you, Dante.

260
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,404
And I gotta go give Charlie
his lunch break.

261
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,245
- Can I actually talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,673
So I know it's a lot to ask,

263
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:47,094
but it would mean so much to me
if you would be a character witness

264
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,053
at my hearing?

265
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,473
Of course. You're an incredible asset
to the library.

266
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,933
Cool. Great. Thanks.

267
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,855
But I actually need you to play up
the whole kick-ass mom thing.

268
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,276
I will character witness
the motherly living shit out of you.

269
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,359
Thank you.

270
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,579
Um...

271
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,167
Yeah, thank you. Uh...

272
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,379
<i>That was hope.</i>

273
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,131
<i>The least I can do...</i>

274
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>is hasten the end of my marriage.</i>

275
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,396
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

276
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
<i>I guess we're having fun now.</i>

277
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:56,121
<i>The swinging book say to test your comfort
by role-playing little scenarios.</i>

278
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,499
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

279
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
<i>The fuck?</i>

280
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,173
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's my bad.

281
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:13,180
You know, it's... It's not the most subtle
come-here of my life,

282
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,767
but I'm really...
I'm not complaining about it.

283
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't even see you there.

284
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>Role-playing gets complicated fast,
evidently.</i>

285
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,445
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't mean to throw this over here.

286
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,947
Um...

287
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,951
I saw Joe's car in the driveway.

288
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,034
Yeah.

289
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,663
He's taking a nap.

290
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,460
I know...
I know I should be chill but, like...

291
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,211
Theo.

292
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,756
Oh.

293
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
You know, actually, Joe...
That's Joe. He's awake.

294
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,184
And he's watching us.

295
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,149
Well, then we better behave.

296
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,525
Right.

297
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,821
Wait, um, the...

298
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
Your dad. The office?

299
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,868
Yeah, I don't know. It's like...
It's impossible.

300
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,535
Okay.

301
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,581
But I'll figure it out.

302
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,708
I will.

303
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,168
Okay.

304
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,088
You're the best.

305
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
Fucking creep show.

306
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,235
Theo's still circling Matthew,
but he'll get there.

307
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,029
I gathered.

308
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,113
Did you?

309
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,031
Yeah.

310
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,992
How did that make you feel?

311
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,537
Jealous?

312
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>A large amount of nothing. However...</i>

313
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,460
Possessive.

314
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
Yeah?

315
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,548
<i>My wife needs to feel
like mildly transgressing</i>

316
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,967
<i>with that idiot rich kid did the trick.</i>

317
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,767
<i>She's not a boring, tired suburban mom.</i>

318
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,356
<i>She's fun. Wild.</i>

319
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,568
<i>Still the Love Quinn who flirts
with strangers in the produce section.</i>

320
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,285
<i>Which is why I'm going to satisfy her
as only someone who knows her can.</i>

321
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>Safe. Reliable.</i>

322
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,377
<i>We can do anything together.</i>

323
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,683
<i>Satisfied but still hungry.</i>

324
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,399
I love you so much.

325
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,319
That felt safe?

326
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,155
So safe.

327
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,447
Solid.

328
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,914
Do you think we're solid?
I think we're solid.

329
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,252
- I mean, if you think we are...
- Yeah.

330
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,296
You'll call the sitter? I'll text Sherry.

331
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,048
- Okay.
- Okay.

332
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,495
- Theo. What happened?
- The Wi-Fi went out.

333
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,122
- What?
- The Wi-Fi went out.

334
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,711
Okay, it's probably a brownout.
Just give it a minute.

335
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,134
Do you think it has to do with the dozens
of servers you snuck into your office?

336
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,515
Are you sleeping okay?
Are you getting enough to eat?

337
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,517
Me? Yeah, I'm good.

338
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,436
- Okay. Good.
- You?

339
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,151
Uh... No. I'm... Yeah, obviously, I'm...

340
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,405
A bit of a rabbit hole. I know.

341
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,952
But if there's something...
If you wanna talk about...

342
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:51,750
Yeah, can we talk about how, like,
people aren't built to live in an office?

343
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,297
Without, like, taking a walk or something,
so their brain can air out.

344
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,381
Right.

345
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,302
Do you wanna walk
to Pobrecito's right now?

346
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,972
We could get some tacos.
We could hang out.

347
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,391
Yeah, I know. I...

348
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah, I'd love that. Um...

349
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,024
I gotta send this thing tonight though.

350
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,027
It's like... It's a letter to the dean

351
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,698
asking if I can drop in
on the classes that I'm missing.

352
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,117
- Really? That's great.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

353
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,077
I mean, I really... I am hungry.

354
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,204
Well, no, no, that's great.

355
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,124
I'll bring you something back.
What do you want? Al pastor?

356
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,835
Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, Dad.

357
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,918
Sure.

358
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,391
Okay, okay, okay.

359
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,952
What the fuck?

360
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
It's scary, isn't it?

361
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,004
What is this?

362
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,300
You planted cameras, like...
Like, all over town?

363
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,720
No, no, no. They were there.
I'm just accessing them.

364
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,804
Accessing. But...

365
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,641
You realize
that this is domestic abuse, right?

366
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,393
That you so casually access.

367
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,980
I wouldn't be looking at Love
if she weren't connected to Natalie.

368
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,066
Or you.

369
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,278
What's that supposed to mean?

370
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
You tell me.

371
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,202
What is it you think
you're doing with Love Quinn?

372
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,832
- You spied on me?
- I didn't spy on you.

373
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,418
- What? You're accusing Love of murder?
- No.

374
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
I don't have proof yet.

375
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:05,384
But either way, she's a married woman
with a baby living next door,

376
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,553
not to mention a husband hiding
some anger management problem.

377
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,223
- What do you care?
- I care when you do stupid shit.

378
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,724
Oh, that's ironic

379
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,685
since I've been at your door,
trying to get you to eat or sleep.

380
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,356
And you've been fucking buried in here,
obsessed, strung out

381
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:23,485
- like some fucking QAnon nutjob.
- You're acting like a stupid fucking brat!

382
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,571
Just move on, okay?
She's dead! She's dead!

383
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,574
None of this is gonna bring her back.

384
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,662
Get out.

385
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,916
- What?
- You heard me. Pack your shit.

386
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,668
You're going back to your mom's tomorrow.

387
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,754
Get the fuck out now!

388
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,720
- Hey.
- Hello.

389
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,933
Cary's getting the rest of the things
from the car.

390
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,560
<i>I'm afraid to ask, what things?</i>

391
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,520
Wow, Sherry you look amazing.

392
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,064
<i>I'm doing this for you.
I'm doing this for you.</i>

393
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,569
Well, thanks again for hosting.
This remodel will be my death.

394
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,488
Elon's decorator is brilliant,
but he's so slow.

395
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,990
It's our pleasure.

396
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,200
There's... I made oysters.

397
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,744
Aphrodisiacs. Well played.

398
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,541
Ha, ha!

399
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,836
- Joe, Joe, Joe.
<i>- Are they moving in?</i>

400
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,045
Bring it in.

401
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,761
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

402
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,764
- Is that Bleu de Chanel?
<i>- No, Cary. It's soap.</i>

403
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,350
Love buys that stuff for me. So I...

404
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,520
A man that doesn't wanna
share his scent. Respect.

405
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,315
I'm sorry, what is this music?

406
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,568
- We'll need to change it stat.
- Babe, I'm all over it.

407
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,488
- You do primary setup.
- Primary?

408
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,114
And your bedroom is...?

409
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,575
- It's upstairs.
- But first...

410
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,372
To a night we won't forget.

411
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,626
<i>To a blame-free exit from this marriage.</i>

412
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,093
<i>I'd like to get this over with,
but how do we get it started?</i>

413
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,807
Okay, let's loosen up a bit, shall we?

414
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,226
I'll start.

415
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,231
Disclosure, I can get quite vocal
in the bedroom.

416
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,566
Don't let it alarm you.

417
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,737
She is a screamer, this one, okay?
I mean, get ready.

418
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,782
Love.

419
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,664
All right, everybody up.

420
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,706
Okay.

421
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,836
Okay. Up, up, up. All right.
Now, shake it out.

422
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,422
Oh, yeah. Full go.

423
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,966
Total liberation.

424
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,343
- I can feel it.
- Get in your hips.

425
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,387
Yes, you, let's do it over here.

426
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,513
- Go.
- Okay.

427
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,267
Okay,

428
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,687
- let's hit this from a spiritual angle.
<i>- This is where they drop the act</i>

429
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,815
<i>- and ask us to join their cult.</i>
- Look each other in the eyes.

430
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,322
<i>She's scared. This isn't her,
but she desperately wants it to be.</i>

431
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,493
Now, if you ever get overwhelmed,
just look at your partner. Connect.

432
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,039
At the end of the day,
that's who you're here for.

433
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,834
And if you feel too overwhelmed,
just use the safe word:

434
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,920
Hakuna matata.

435
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
<i>Disney should sue these people.</i>

436
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,345
Okay. No more talk. Let's dance.

437
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,429
Love?

438
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,224
Hey, you.

439
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,326
<i>There's the Love I remember, free, open.</i>

440
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,788
<i>♪ I don't need to feel the sun
Let me touch your skin ♪</i>

441
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,418
<i>I couldn't be happier for...
Oh, there it is. Compersion.</i>

442
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>♪ Fill my mind with dirtiness
I'll invade your dreams ♪</i>

443
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,679
Come on. I wanna show you
what I set up in the bedroom.

444
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,473
<i>And I'm officially terrified.</i>

445
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,817
<i>I did say I'd endure torture for you.</i>

446
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,238
All right. Just remember,
tonight is a marathon, it is not a sprint.

447
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,283
We have to have each other's backs.

448
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,618
I got you covered.

449
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,166
My magic potions.

450
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,294
Stimulants, lab-grade shrooms,

451
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,754
liquid downregulation,

452
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,716
killer rest-and-recovery aid
but strong as dick.

453
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,595
I KO'd myself, like, six times
before getting my dosage right.

454
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,223
Yes.

455
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,851
This boosts testosterone like a mofo.

456
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,935
Okay.

457
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,315
For you.

458
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,070
<i>Actually, I probably need it tonight.</i>

459
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,074
Okay. Down the hatch.

460
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,911
Thattaboy.

461
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,913
Now...

462
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,585
allow me to introduce you to my ritual

463
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,587
for a night like tonight.

464
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,348
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

465
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,267
<i>Oh, Marienne.</i>

466
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,521
<i>You are the only one who could make
whatever's about to happen worthwhile.</i>

467
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,319
It's okay, you can look at it.

468
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,948
Look at my dick.

469
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,369
Welcome to the real party, brother.

470
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,047
So glad you're here.

471
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,515
<i>What the fuck is happening?</i>

472
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,819
If you don't wanna fuck yourself,

473
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,822
how is someone else gonna
wanna fuck you, my man?

474
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,785
<i>Oh, of course. Cary is Cary-sexual.</i>

475
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,123
Well, don't just stare.
Grab a mirror, join in.

476
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,168
<i>My savior.</i>

477
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,212
Cary, you know what?
This is our babysitter.

478
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,508
- Real quick. Real quick, real quick.
- Hey, we said no... phones.

479
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,384
Hey.

480
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,722
- Is everything okay?
- I'm sorry.

481
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,184
I didn't know who else to call
'cause I have no friends because of him.

482
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,101
Ryan?

483
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,564
An anonymous e-mail went out
to all of my contacts.

484
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,150
I know it was him
because there were photos,

485
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:24,614
- explicit photos that only he has and...
<i>- Oh, no. I know those photos.</i>

486
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,493
And one of the people he sent it to
is Amy Woodruff, the editor,

487
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,537
the children's book editor.

488
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,913
And... And...

489
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,208
Now she'll never work with me.

490
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,669
<i>He is truly evil.</i>

491
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,045
I'm so sorry.

492
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,468
I knew he was up to something.

493
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,597
He fucking gets off on this shit.

494
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:59,190
The worst part about being married is
that they actually know you so well

495
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,651
that they can just use it
for the rest of your life.

496
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,862
Listen to me, those photos,

497
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,824
I know, sane people know,
Ryan weaponized them,

498
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:12,871
and that makes him the bad guy
and a disgusting excuse for a human being.

499
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,999
How am I supposed
to look at him in court tomorrow?

500
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,294
With pity. He's a piece of shit
and you're gonna win.

501
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,378
The rest...

502
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,966
we'll figure out, okay?

503
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,511
I'll help you,

504
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,723
if and only if you ask me to, of course.

505
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,020
Um...

506
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,356
Do you wanna come over?

507
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,191
I just...

508
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>I could really use a friend.</i>

509
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,739
<i>I'd give anything to.</i>

510
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,033
Joe, where the fuck are you, brother?

511
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,411
I wish I could, but...

512
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
No, no, no. It's okay.

513
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,626
No, you've actually... You've done enough.

514
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,254
Thanks for answering, Goldberg.

515
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,392
You missed the finale in there.
Give it to me.

516
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,437
This will go in the phone bowl downstairs
with everybody else's.

517
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,233
Well, it's go time.

518
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,492
Oh, welcome back.

519
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,745
I missed you.

520
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,121
<i>Someone's loose.</i>

521
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,168
- Are you okay? You still seem tense.
<i>- You think?</i>

522
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,171
- I'm good. No, I'm good.
- He's just a little shy.

523
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,772
<i>Oh, okay, so this is really happening.</i>

524
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,194
<i>Uh... Mm. Ow.</i>

525
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,864
Watch.

526
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,127
Is there something wrong?

527
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,797
Are you okay with this?

528
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,717
More than okay.

529
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,677
<i>I'm embarrassed for us.</i>

530
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,943
Ooh.

531
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,657
<i>This is fine. This is great, even.</i>

532
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,662
Sorry to ask twice,
but is there something wrong?

533
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,248
Hey, sweetie,
just wait for the pill to kick in.

534
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,458
Oh, yeah.

535
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,793
I'm not used to an audience, I think.

536
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,631
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Just remember, look at your partner.

537
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,010
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, go.

538
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,848
<i>But I don't want Love,
I don't want Sherry.</i>

539
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,852
<i>I don't want any of this.
All I want is you.</i>

540
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,152
There you are.

541
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,945
There you are.

542
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,287
I knew you'd come.

543
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,478
Big boy.

544
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,023
Yes.

545
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,717
Hakuna matata!

546
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,719
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fuck!

547
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,100
<i>- Fuck. Somehow I just became the bad guy.</i>
- No, it's okay. It's all right.

548
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,690
<i>Shit.</i>

549
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,696
<i>I cannot let her blame me
for this shit show.</i>

550
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,451
Hey.

551
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,999
What happened?

552
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,004
Who is she?

553
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,133
Excuse me?

554
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,138
Who were you thinking about just then?

555
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,142
Nobody. Just you. It's always you.

556
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,225
Bullshit.

557
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,355
I know you, Joe.

558
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,442
I know what I do will never
be good enough for you.

559
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,446
This was your idea.

560
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,281
Well, I had to do something.

561
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,364
Or what?

562
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,328
Why do you act like I'm not all in?
I am right here.

563
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,247
All I do is worry about you.

564
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,957
I don't need you to worry about me.

565
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,211
I need your heart.

566
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,464
- Henry needs your heart.
- Leave Henry out of this.

567
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,924
I can't, Joe.

568
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,637
Unlike you, I have to be his mother 24/7.

569
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,223
In addition to running a fucking business,

570
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,517
keeping this house together,
dragging you to therapy,

571
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,146
trying to be my sexiest self so you don't
get bored and find another Natalie.

572
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,316
- Can you please lower your voice?
- Why? You hate hearing the truth?

573
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,695
- Our marriage is completely one-sided.
- That is absurd.

574
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,322
You made me kill her.

575
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,741
In addition
to being mother of the fucking year,

576
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,452
I had to run interference
on one of your fucking patterns!

577
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,621
- I killed Natalie for you!
- Shut...

578
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,748
up.

579
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,884
Was that...?

580
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,219
<i>Fuck me.</i>

581
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,846
Maybe they didn't hear anything.

582
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,432
We have to know for sure.

583
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,269
Okay, well,

584
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,357
Sherry has this tell when she's lying,
she scratches her arm.

585
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,944
I'll follow your lead.

586
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,530
Okay.

587
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,253
- There you are.
- Hey.

588
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,463
Take any longer,
I'd have to shuck the corn again.

589
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,676
I'm so sorry, guys. I just got in my head.

590
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,052
I'm good now.

591
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,347
I hope I didn't kill the vibe.

592
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,058
Oh, my God, of course not.

593
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,020
- It's so easy to get overwhelmed.
- Yeah.

594
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,104
Yeah.

595
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,022
Now...

596
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,943
where were we?

597
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,658
<i>I just can't tell.</i>

598
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,453
Something wrong?

599
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:55,124
Oh, I'm great.
Why don't we get on the bed?

600
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,383
Go.

601
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,766
Hey, Sherry.

602
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,694
I don't know what you think you heard...

603
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,323
But we're...

604
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,084
There you go.
It's gonna end badly for Love too.

605
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,960
Sherry knows Krav Maga.

606
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,338
Go to sleep, buddy.

607
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,582
Let me go!

608
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,044
No! No, please! No! God!

609
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,754
<i>That does not sound good.</i>

610
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,382
<i>He could be at Matthew's by now.</i>

611
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,188
<i>Guess I'm gonna use Cary's gift
from the hunting trip after all.</i>

612
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,374
Cary, let's go back inside.
We can talk about this.

613
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,925
<i>This is it. I never see you again.</i>

614
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,762
<i>I get impaled, Love goes to prison.</i>

615
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,515
<i>Henry grows up in the system.</i>

616
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,103
<i>No.</i>

617
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,482
Are you okay?

618
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,905
Holy fucking shit.

619
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,243
I think that was the best sex
we've ever had.

620
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,579
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

621
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>The spark our marriage needed
doesn't come from swinging.</i>

622
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,754
<i>Our love language is violence.</i>

623
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,269
<i>Shit.</i>

624
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,902
- Hey.
- What happened to the car?

625
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,240
Love spilled fruit sauce.
So I'm just getting it before it sets in.

626
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,617
At 5 a.m.?

627
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,328
Couldn't sleep.

628
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,413
<i>Doesn't look like he's gotten much either.</i>

629
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,498
You okay?

630
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,796
What was that last night?

631
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,257
Last night? Oh, we were...
I mean, were we that loud?

632
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,637
We had a kid with a sitter,
had a little fun.

633
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,264
With the Conrads? I saw their car.

634
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,227
Yeah, they were here for a second. Yeah.

635
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,520
Oh.

636
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,523
I thought I heard someone scream.

637
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,823
It was drunken shenanigans.
It was harmless, really. I'm embarrassed.

638
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,908
Stupid fun, really.

639
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,328
Yeah, you and your wife, Love.
Just having fun.

640
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,127
Yeah, again,
I apologize if it disturbed you.

641
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,130
We were saying we should have you over
for dinner sometime soon.

642
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,048
Yeah, real busy with work. But sometime.

643
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,842
Sometime.

644
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,500
I put my best friend...

645
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,628
in a cage.

646
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,340
Oh, my God.

647
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,554
I am so grateful for you.

648
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,225
I don't know anybody else
who would understand.

649
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,437
I don't know what I'd do without you.

650
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,653
Okay.

651
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,907
I'm gonna make breakfast

652
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,411
and then I can contact Henry's sitter
to see if they'll take him longer.

653
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,163
We can just clean up.

654
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,582
We'll go over there.
We'll "good cop, bad cop" them.

655
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,543
<i>She's too good at this now.
This should not be routine.</i>

656
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,587
We will get through this, okay?

657
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,133
<i>I don't want to, I want you...
Shit. Your custody hearing.</i>

658
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,134
Joe?

659
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:49,598
I forgot, I promised to fill in for Dante.
He's got a thing and I have to...

660
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,310
I'll be fast, meet you soon as I'm done.
Don't do anything until I get there.

661
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,941
<i>- You are, as ever, an inspiration.</i>
- Thank you.

662
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,777
Well, that happened.

663
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,862
- You killed it.
- You were so great.

664
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,156
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Flawless, unimpeachable.

665
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,367
Dare I say, unironically,
mother of the year.

666
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,161
I'm so glad you were here. Both of you.

667
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,831
Thank you.

668
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,259
<i>What was that?</i>

669
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,512
<i>Are Ryan and the judge friends?</i>

670
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,269
<i>You were right. The system is rigged.</i>

671
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,604
Come on, Dante. We're gonna go.

672
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,985
<i>And as long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.</i>

673
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,078
Hey. You good?

674
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,456
Yeah, I'm okay. What about...?

675
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,668
Oh, they're... They're just waking up.

676
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,382
Hey.

677
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,678
We're a team, okay?

678
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,806
Till death do us part.

679
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,393
<i>Clearly, my plan has backfired.
My wife seems more into me than ever.</i>

680
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:36,788
<i>Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.</i>

681
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:43,086
<i>How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?</i>
