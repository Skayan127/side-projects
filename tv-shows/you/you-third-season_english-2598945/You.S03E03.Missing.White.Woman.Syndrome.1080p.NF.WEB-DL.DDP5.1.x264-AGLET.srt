1
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,022
Love, what did you do?

3
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,482
We bury her in the woods.

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,443
Love, this is my son, Theo.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,779
- I didn't know you had a son.
- Stepson from my first marriage.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
I got the twins wearing those Vital Rings.

7
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,409
- Does this have GPS?
- We all wear them.

8
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,292
<i>If Matthew has access
to Natalie's ring,</i>

9
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,872
<i>he'll be able to see exactly where she is.</i>

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,542
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,629
So... they know.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>We've got this. Together.</i>

13
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,564
<i>Things are always better in the morning.</i>

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>At least that's what Scout tells us.</i>

15
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>And who am I to argue with Harper Lee?</i>

16
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>Then again, Scout didn't help</i>

17
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,087
<i>to cover up the murder
of the next-door neighbor's wife.</i>

18
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,968
<i>Here, in Madre Linda,
safest neighborhood in the Golden State,</i>

19
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,138
<i>every passing morning brings
more attention.</i>

20
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,475
<i>A woman has disappeared.</i>

21
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,396
<i>It's domestic noir come to life,
and people are here for it.</i>

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,731
Keep it going.

23
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
Hold, hold, hold.

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,026
Squeeze glutes.

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,236
Starting.

26
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,408
<i>It's been three days since the sleepy town
of Madre Linda was rocked</i>

27
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>by the disappearance of Natalie Engler.</i>

28
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>The 32-year-old realtor was last seen
leaving her home for work.</i>

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>Her vehicle was found outside
a cabin near Redwoods State Park.</i>

30
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,255
- Ready, sweetie?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,756
All right, here we go.

32
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>Her husband,
tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,</i>

33
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>who made his fortune
in cutting-edge surveillance,</i>

34
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,891
<i>has not made a public statement.</i>

35
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,018
God, I hope she just ran off somewhere.

36
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,980
For now, friends are hopeful

37
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,942
that the police will find her
with the help of this community.

38
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,737
Reporting live from Madre Linda,
Ryan Goodwin, Channel 3 News.

39
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,656
We got it.

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,117
Every day it's the same fucking story.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,328
We need him to give a statement.

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,761
And our son is mercifully
once again sleeping.

43
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,308
- Can I make you some eggs?
- There's more vans than yesterday.

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,643
I wish they'd move on already.

45
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,228
<i>You are worried.</i>

46
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,897
I'm sure they will. Soon.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,483
<i>Your previous mistakes were cleaned up
by the family fixer.</i>

48
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,029
<i>No media or police to deal with
when they've been paid off.</i>

49
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,865
When do you think
everything will die down?

50
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,201
A week, maybe two.

51
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,411
How can you be so calm?

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>Experience. Try killing
a celebrity comedian without a fixer.</i>

53
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,832
Joe.

54
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,544
I'm scared.

55
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,465
Dr. Chandra said
that we should give words to our emotions.

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,548
Well, I'm...

57
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,718
scared.

58
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,474
I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.

59
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,434
We have done everything right.

60
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,271
But the ring?
That was a close call, but we fixed it.

61
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,856
We talked to the cops.

62
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>They didn't raise an eyebrow.</i>

63
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,693
This won't take long.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,988
Is there anything
you can tell us about Natalie Engler

65
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,491
or her relationship with her husband?

66
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,535
We just moved here
a few months ago with a newborn,

67
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,830
so we haven't had much time
for socializing.

68
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,752
Yeah. She did help me lease my bakery,
but other than that,

69
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,420
I don't really know them.

70
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,507
- I wish we could tell you more.
- Can I refill your coffee?

71
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,469
Of course they're not gonna act
like they're suspicious.

72
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,348
True. But we haven't given them
a reason to be suspicious. What?

73
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,726
A few questions, sir.

74
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,729
Matthew, Channel 6.
A quick statement, please.

75
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,274
Hey, hey.

76
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,900
Look.

77
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>Have the police said anything?</i>

78
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
<i>Get off my property
or I'll have you removed.</i>

79
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,132
<i>- Matthew, statement.
- Can you say something?</i>

80
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:47,996
He's innocent, but he's acting guilty.
That's strange but... good.

81
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,249
Good for us.
If he goes down for this, we're free.

82
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,252
<i>You're doing
your Lady Macbeth thing again.</i>

83
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,753
<i>Like when you wanted
to frame Ellie for killing Hendy.</i>

84
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,047
<i>You feel trapped
and it's clouding your judgment.</i>

85
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,633
It's probably best
if no one goes down for this, right?

86
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,972
Like, if nobody finds the body,
people will eventually assume she ran off.

87
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,849
Yeah. You're right.

88
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,769
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

89
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,149
This.

90
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,155
Just normal life.
We keep watching the news, just in case.

91
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,115
We go to work.

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,076
We take care of Henry.

93
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,915
I'll keep us safe, I promise.

94
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,499
So...

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,670
just be normal.

96
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,754
Exactly.

97
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,176
Something terrible happened
to Natalie Engler.

98
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,386
We had nothing to do with it.

99
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,433
We are just the nice,
normal neighbors next door.

100
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,320
<i>Crying for the camera isn't
for everyone, fine.</i>

101
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>But he's just working.</i>

102
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>I know why I'm acting normal,
but why is he?</i>

103
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>Fuck. The last thing I need is
to inspire him to start watching me.</i>

104
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,592
- Look! Grandma's here!
- Thank you, Mustafa. Ciao.

105
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,512
Why were you talking to our trust lawyer?

106
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,390
Dreadful divorce nonsense.
Don't get me started.

107
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,102
Is that woman still missing?
I had to park two streets over.

108
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,562
Come here, my darling, my darling.

109
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,441
Glamma missed you. Glamma missed you.
Glamma missed you.

110
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:45,071
I'm sure the husband did it.
You have to watch out for husbands.

111
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,864
Ray would love to have me killed.

112
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,991
You know,
that's if I don't have him killed first.

113
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,452
I assume there's coffee.

114
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,705
Let me get some coffee. Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,088
- Do you think he's warm?
- I think he's just tired.

116
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,924
Maybe I should stay.

117
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,136
You're projecting
your anxiety on your son.

118
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
Go run your bakery.

119
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,516
Forty and I are gonna have
a beautiful day.

120
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,768
<i>♪ Baby, baby ♪</i>

121
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,084
Hey, guys. What can I get you?

122
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,212
Thanks for asking.
But we're here as concerned citizens.

123
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,465
We started the committee
to find Natalie Engler.

124
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,509
Did she ever say anything to you
about wanting to run away?

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,261
Or being scared of creepy Matthew?

126
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,180
Um, uh...

127
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,263
No.

128
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,185
Don't you think this is premature?

129
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,770
- We don't know if anything bad...
- Matter of time.

130
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,648
Oh, my God, have you seen
the Tracy Paulson murder docuseries?

131
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,526
I have. Spoiler alert, it's the husband.

132
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,278
- Always the husband.
- Always.

133
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,906
I heard Matthew wasn't even
the first to call the police.

134
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
- Her sister did.
- Love.

135
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,745
Have you ever heard Natalie
and Matthew fighting?

136
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,043
Joe and I barely know them.

137
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:26,547
She showed me this place
shortly before, you know...

138
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,759
This must be so difficult for you.

139
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,845
Thank you.

140
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,641
Honestly, the only thing I can do
to feel normal is come here.

141
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,683
And...

142
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,064
these keto vanilla bean scones.

143
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,027
Sure you don't want one?

144
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,741
- Why not? Oh.
- I would love a couple.

145
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:58,287
Brandon is coming off of an IF,
so this will be a nice treat for him.

146
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,799
End of each day, check tables
and study carrels for re-shelves.

147
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,634
That's where they go until the last...

148
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>Somehow, I chose
the perfect place to be normal in.</i>

149
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,058
<i>An oasis of unpretentious regular people.</i>

150
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,602
<i>I love it here.</i>

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Hello?

152
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,358
<i>My grown-up hall monitor
of a boss notwithstanding.</i>

153
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,442
Sorry about that.

154
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:33,322
I have to say, I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

155
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,284
Unless you're one of those parents

156
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,453
trying to pad a nonexistent
community-service résumé

157
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,747
to get his kid
into one of the top schools.

158
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,165
<i>Is she psychic?</i>

159
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,126
Mm-hm.

160
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,673
Hey, Dante. This is Joe.

161
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>Dante Ferguson. Former Navy.</i>

162
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,721
<i>One hundred percent blind.
Longtime friend of my new stern boss.</i>

163
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,141
Dante will be your go-to
for any questions. He knows all.

164
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,769
All-knowing Dante's listening
to the news. It's about Natalie Engler.

165
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,770
<i>Oh, no.</i>

166
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,981
Madre Linda has
her own Missing White Woman.

167
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:11,360
Missing White Woman Syndrome is
America's favorite pastime next to porn.

168
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,989
- Missing White Woman...?
- Syndrome.

169
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,075
When upper-class,
attractive white ladies go missing,

170
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,077
they get tons of media coverage.

171
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,913
- Doesn't happen for other victims.
- Yeah.

172
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,168
Well, the media has a thirst
for anything salacious, right?

173
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>Why do I feel like I'm failing a test?</i>

174
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,299
We're speaking of a specific phenomenon.

175
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,761
When white women receive
disproportionately high attention,

176
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,638
a clear message is being sent.

177
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,225
White ladies deserve to be rescued.
The rest of us can fend for ourselves.

178
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,519
Agreed. Obviously.

179
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,521
I'm not sure why you're saying "obviously"

180
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,982
when you didn't even know
about the phenomenon.

181
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,777
Mm. She got you there, beanpole.

182
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,696
<i>- How does he know I...?
- Tender is the Night.</i>

183
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,114
You knew her.

184
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,949
- We're neighbors.
- Shush.

185
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,369
They're about to interview her friend.

186
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,080
- Mind if I have a bathroom break?
- Bathroom's that way.

187
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,414
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

188
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,797
- Dante, kill me now.
- Is he cute?

189
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,216
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

190
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,051
<i>We set up a tip line,</i>

191
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,428
<i>and you can follow us
on Facebook, Twitter,</i>

192
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,931
<i>Insta, Snapchat, TikTok, and Tumblr.</i>

193
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,600
For those of you
that are still using that.

194
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,687
Finding Natalie seems
incredibly important to you.

195
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, my God, it's my number one priority.
Natalie was my dearest and closest friend.

196
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,444
<i>She hated her.</i>

197
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,196
<i>We all loved her.</i>

198
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,117
<i>I'm not really sure why
her husband hasn't told you this,</i>

199
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,578
<i>but I think the public would like
to hear from him.</i>

200
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,165
<i>And she just slipped in
a Matthew dig on live television.</i>

201
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,084
<i>Bitchy, but not the worst thing for us.</i>

202
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,211
<i>Why do you think Natalie's disappearance</i>

203
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,630
<i>has struck such a chord in this community?</i>

204
00:11:54,714 --> 00:12:00,136
Natalie is a woman who cares deeply
for this town and everyone in it.

205
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
In fact, one of the last things she did

206
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,183
was lease a space for a bakery
for her next-door neighbor.

207
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,893
She lives right over there.

208
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>Did Sherry Conrad just tell
the entire world</i>

209
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,817
<i>that one of the last people who saw
the Missing White Woman was my wife?</i>

210
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,112
<i>I have to reassure you.
Everything is fine. Still fine.</i>

211
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,995
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

212
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,532
Hello?

213
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,247
Hi. Yeah, absolutely.
What can I do for you, detective?

214
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,623
<i>Fuck me.</i>

215
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,629
When we spoke
to you and your wife,

216
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
you said you barely knew Natalie.

217
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

218
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,469
Then why is there security footage

219
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,472
of you two chatting
in a grocery store parking lot

220
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,182
two days before she vanished?

221
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,769
<i>Sweating? I need to get it together.</i>

222
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,232
Coincidence. I like to say hi
when I run into a neighbor.

223
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,234
How do you explain...

224
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
this exchange?

225
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,157
<i>Does every inch of Madre Linda
have a camera?</i>

226
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,786
Do you typically receive prophylactics
from your neighbors

227
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,913
when you just stop to say hi?

228
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>They don't suspect me.
They are just doing their job.</i>

229
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,168
<i>I need to stop sweating.</i>

230
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,091
- You can deal with that if you need to.
<i>- So they can observe my behavior.</i>

231
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,760
No, it's fine. It's okay.

232
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,845
Condoms...

233
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,307
The thing is,
Natalie has a weird sense of humor,

234
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,017
and she gave these to me as a joke.

235
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,852
I still don't know what she meant.

236
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>What do they want? A confession?</i>

237
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>Wait. That's not a terrible idea.</i>

238
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:45,950
I wasn't going to say this.
But I think I need to come clean.

239
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,410
I live with a newborn...

240
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,040
and a very stressed wife.

241
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
There's nowhere...

242
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,174
for a man to enjoy himself,
if you understand what I'm saying.

243
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,137
Add in a mother-in-law who stops
by unannounced frequently...

244
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,932
We strongly advise you

245
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,185
to not do that anymore.

246
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,522
I will try to contain myself.

247
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,861
<i>Masturbation saves the day for now.</i>

248
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,536
We're at A Fresh Tart and look at this.

249
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,999
We got Madre Linda's
newest baking queen, Love Quinn.

250
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,626
- Are you...?
- I'm making an ironic TikTok.

251
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
Delete it!

252
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,628
Okay.

253
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

254
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,052
- Yep. It's deleted.
- I'm just having a bad hair day.

255
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,554
Looks pretty good to me.

256
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,348
Stop that.

257
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,600
Stop what?

258
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,767
Flirting.

259
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,687
Yeah, okay. Yes. Yes.

260
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,607
- Yes, you are right. You are married.
- Thank you.

261
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,527
Now, what can I get you?

262
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,073
Okay, so my house
is swarming with reporters.

263
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,702
So I had to jump my fence
just to go get some lunch,

264
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,956
which is also the story
of why I forgot my wallet.

265
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,874
Ah.

266
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,503
And now I am gonna die
starving and destitute.

267
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,631
Unless...

268
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,300
you were to...

269
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,947
My issue is that you're still flirting
and I asked you not to.

270
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:35,309
I'm not flirting with you.
I'm begging you for food.

271
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,189
Okay. Jesus fucking Christ.

272
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,900
Thank you, my lady and savior.

273
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,525
Okay.

274
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,905
- Carrot or chai walnut?
- Carrot, please.

275
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,959
Fuck, did I just fail
a secret personality test or something?

276
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,670
Oh, no, I, um...

277
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,923
That was my first recipe.

278
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,885
And I used to make it all the time
for my brother when he would...

279
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,430
When he came around.

280
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,267
Well, let's see.

281
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,652
Are you fucking kidding me?

282
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,737
What the fuck?

283
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,078
Must be hard with Natalie missing.

284
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,123
You know, I love a media zoo.

285
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,626
How are you holding up?
Do you have people you can talk to?

286
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,717
I wasn't trying to pry. I'm, um...

287
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,012
Mom? I'm sorry. I can't...

288
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,056
Wait, slow down.

289
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,268
Oh, my God. Um...

290
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,022
Okay. Yes. I'm on my way. Mm-hm.

291
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,859
- Is everything okay? What's going on?
- My baby is sick.

292
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,527
- Oh.
- I need to go.

293
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,906
I need to close the bakery
and turn off the ovens.

294
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,827
No, I know. You know what?
I got it. I got it. I can do it.

295
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,789
I know how ovens work. It'll be fine.
Go be with your baby. Go.

296
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,750
- Be with your baby.
- Yeah.

297
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,836
- There's a spare key in the drawer.
- Okay, in the drawer.

298
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,919
Yeah.

299
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>What if the detectives
weren't just fishing?</i>

300
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,221
<i>What if they know more
than they were saying?</i>

301
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>But no one knew about Natalie and me
except Love, at least, I think.</i>

302
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,808
<i>Unless...</i>

303
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,645
There.

304
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,401
<i>Matthew. What if there were more cameras?</i>

305
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
<i>What if she lied to me,
her boring neighbor?</i>

306
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,198
<i>What if Matthew's building a case
against me?</i>

307
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,383
<i>Shit.</i>

308
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,159
<i>I never called you back. I must be calm.</i>

309
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,745
<i>You're a steady, stalwart Atticus Finch.</i>

310
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,248
- I'm sorry, they had more questions.
<i>- I'm at the hospital.</i>

311
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,292
Henry has the measles.

312
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,926
<i>I've been kidnapped,
held at knifepoint, held at gunpoint,</i>

313
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,470
<i>lost a finger, been locked in a cage,</i>

314
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,639
<i>but in my history of scared,</i>

315
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,306
<i>this...</i>

316
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,435
<i>is the most scared I've ever been.</i>

317
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
That nurse has been gone
an awfully long time.

318
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,940
It's a quick test. He'll be right back.

319
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,527
I looked at his blood work
and he was infected about a week ago.

320
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,279
How? I thought
the measles were eradicated.

321
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,280
Even with COVID,

322
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,908
there are parents
who don't have their kids vaccinated.

323
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,495
You need to contact anyone
who's been near Henry right away.

324
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,997
You've all had your immunizations?

325
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,081
- Yes.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm sure I did.

327
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,002
<i>Oh, really, Ms. Peace,
Love and Yoni Eggs?</i>

328
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,841
- Are you sure you had Love vaccinated?
- What does...? Yes, don't be ridiculous.

329
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,092
What are the symptoms?

330
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:59,096
- Fever?
- Cough, runny nose, general discomfort.

331
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,977
Now, in severe cases,
hearing loss, possible seizures.

332
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,397
<i>Correction.
This is the most scared I've ever been.</i>

333
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,943
Is there medicine?

334
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,280
For the fever.
Otherwise, it has to run its course.

335
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,824
We'll keep him a few more hours
for observation.

336
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,907
Okay.

337
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,534
Thank you.

338
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,332
Hi, Margaret, it's Love.

339
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,919
Sorry to be delivering this news,
but Henry has the measles.

340
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,671
<i>I'm calling from the hospital.</i>

341
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,214
<i>Thought I should let you know</i>

342
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,758
<i>since we were all
at Hudson's birthday party last week.</i>

343
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,303
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

344
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,512
Oh, my God.

345
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,140
Um...

346
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,476
- I'm getting a call. Do you mind?
- I have to go.

347
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,192
- Hi, Sherry. I was about to call.
<i>- I just heard.</i>

348
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,651
Poor little guy!

349
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,154
But you do not need to feel embarrassed.

350
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,322
Embarrassed?

351
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,658
<i>Why don't I handle the calls
so you can focus on Henry?</i>

352
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,246
Um, that's very kind,
but it's important that I do it myself.

353
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,498
Love? Love?

354
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,127
Ooh.

355
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,338
Did you hear about Love's baby?

356
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,215
- What happened?
- What happened?

357
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
My heart is breaking for them.

358
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,516
Yes, I have to run, Mustafa.
Can we finish this afternoon?

359
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,518
Good. Ciao.

360
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,190
How were those calls?
I hope your friends weren't too upset.

361
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,025
Why were you on the phone?

362
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,570
If something's wrong, you need to tell me.

363
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,530
I'm buying a vineyard.

364
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,076
- You're doing what?
- Buying a vineyard, Love.

365
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,996
So the money that was in flux
is no longer there.

366
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

367
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,876
Your bakery will be fine.

368
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,211
You'll figure it out.

369
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,296
You're amazing.

370
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,925
- Now don't get upset.
- I'm not upset. This is enlightening.

371
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,927
I keep asking myself, wondering:

372
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,137
"Why do I keep trying
to win Sherry's approval

373
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,725
when she keeps stabbing me in the back
like a fucking stealth cunt?"

374
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,937
It's obvious.
I'm recreating my relationship with you.

375
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,564
You're under a lot of stress.
I know you don't mean...

376
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,191
God. I want you to leave.

377
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,819
I came here for a fresh start,
and you followed me here

378
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,862
and brought
all your toxic garbage with you.

379
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,447
You have so much anger.

380
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,700
It's not healthy.

381
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,962
<i>Is this retribution for my sins?</i>

382
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,862
You have to get better.

383
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,304
I haven't always been the best person.

384
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,140
But being your dad...

385
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,644
is changing me.

386
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,148
You get better.

387
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,777
Just get better. I promise
to be a man worthy of raising you.

388
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,076
<i>Ryan Goodwin with the latest
in the Natalie Engler investigation.</i>

389
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,620
<i>Friends close to Natalie Engler say
she went missing</i>

390
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,665
<i>shortly after submitting
the lease for this bakery,</i>

391
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,793
<i>owned by local resident
Love Quinn-Goldberg.</i>

392
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,546
<i>Could this be the last place
Natalie was seen?</i>

393
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,968
Joe?

394
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,805
<i>As if things weren't fucked enough.</i>

395
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,853
So cops are asking you questions,
and my name and business are on the news.

396
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,356
Acting normal isn't working.
We need to do something.

397
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,650
You're right.
You're right. Matthew's a threat.

398
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,197
But everybody already thinks
that he did something to her.

399
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,281
You're saying...?

400
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,950
Frame him. Trying to think
of a word not from a movie.

401
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
It's fine. I'm in.

402
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,454
How?

403
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,961
I do still have one thing from the box.

404
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,884
Natalie's scarf with her blood on it.
I only kept it for insurance.

405
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,220
Take care of it.

406
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,941
<i>Whoa. Oof.</i>

407
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,024
<i>Okay.</i>

408
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,201
<i>What? How? No. But it can't be.</i>

409
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,286
<i>I thought I was sweating
because I'm guilty.</i>

410
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,707
<i>The measles, for fuck's sake!
What else can go wrong?</i>

411
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>That... That came on fast.</i>

412
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,798
<i>I've gotta get to Matthew's house
to plant the scarf.</i>

413
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,802
<i>Uh. I'm burning up.
Room is spinning. Everything...</i>

414
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,054
<i>I've got to do this. All over a scarf.</i>

415
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,848
<i>Focus, focus.</i>

416
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,016
<i>I should lie down.</i>

417
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,726
You sure about that?

418
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,731
<i>This can't be good.</i>

419
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,900
Weren't you in the middle of something?

420
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,156
Like saving your family?

421
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,239
Yes.

422
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,743
Yes, my family.

423
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,374
I have to plant
Natalie's scarf at Matthew's.

424
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,835
You could hop the fence in the backyard.

425
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,753
No. No, he has cameras.

426
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,591
The one outside is broken.
If you're worried, pop a hoodie on.

427
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,926
You'll look just like
Matthew's douchebag kid.

428
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,727
Sealed and everything.

429
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,229
It's almost like you anticipated
needing it all along.

430
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,440
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,359
Where are you going?

432
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,322
Where you should be going.
Boo Radley's house.

433
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,855
Okay.

434
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,149
One foot in front of the other.

435
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,955
Where is he?

436
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,250
Where's Henry?

437
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,710
Did you get vaccinated, Joe?

438
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,468
He's not moving! Somebody get a doctor!
Somebody help me!

439
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,805
Joe?

440
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,642
Are you not feeling well?

441
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm Nurse Fiona.
I'm going to check you out.

442
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
Come in. Sit down.

443
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,916
Open up.

444
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
So you think you have a fever, huh?

445
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,759
- If the boys are being mean to you...
- I can take care of myself.

446
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,843
I know.

447
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,139
You can stay here as long as you like.

448
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,147
You're gonna be fine.

449
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:58,575
You know, I noticed that we don't have
any record of your vaccinations.

450
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,579
- Did your mom ever take you to get a shot?
- Yeah, of course.

451
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,000
I think maybe in the move,
we lost a record or something, but...

452
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,503
she did it.

453
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,587
She was good.

454
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,924
No. No, you shouldn't have said that.

455
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,095
If you hadn't lied, you wouldn't be sick.

456
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,307
Tell the nurse. She was a terrible mother.

457
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,809
- Stop it.
- She was selfish and crazy.

458
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,311
- Stop.
- Didn't take care of you.

459
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,812
Go away. Go away!

460
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,273
- Where are you going?
- It's too late now!

461
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,078
Hey! Look at me! Hey!
Look at me! Look at me!

462
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,829
Calm down.

463
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,373
Calm down.

464
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,045
<i>I think this is real.</i>

465
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,798
What were you doing in my backyard?

466
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,633
<i>Fuck.</i>

467
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,718
<i>Fuck. Fuck!</i>

468
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
Love.

469
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,062
- Hey.
- Hi.

470
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,400
Um, here.
I thought I would bring you dinner.

471
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,734
It's tacos.

472
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,112
Very thoughtful of you.

473
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,782
So how is your son doing?

474
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,743
- He's okay.
- Yeah? That's good.

475
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,412
He's, uh...

476
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,792
He's not okay.

477
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,712
Some fucking brain-dead anti-vaxxer
got him sick,

478
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,506
and it's probably getting
other people infected

479
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,885
with some horrible life-threatening virus
that shouldn't even be a thing anymore.

480
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,303
Hey, hey, hey.

481
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
It's okay.

482
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,728
- I'm sorry.
- Hey. Mm-mm.

483
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,980
You don't have to apologize.

484
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,607
Oh. I locked up the store.

485
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,777
It was a really nice distraction
from being at home.

486
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,321
Until the news crew arrived.

487
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,406
Mm.

488
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,784
Uh, when are you going back to school?

489
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,370
Uh, I don't know. I feel like...

490
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,790
we should probably wait
until we know about Natalie.

491
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:16,463
So if you need some cheap-to-free labor
at the bakery,

492
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,423
I'm your guy.

493
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,425
Yeah, come in whenever you want.

494
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,011
I could use the help.

495
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,512
Okay.

496
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,099
That would be great. Yeah.

497
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,852
Especially if it gets me away
from my dad. Even better.

498
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,147
He's really that hard to live with?

499
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,023
Yeah.

500
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,443
He's just never really been
a communicator,

501
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,779
but, you know, his wife's missing.

502
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,280
So if there was a time

503
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,742
to start expressing
some form of emotion, it's now.

504
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,370
But he's not.
He's, like, totally closed off.

505
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,748
I don't know.
I just feel like it's gonna make him,

506
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,125
like, even that more unreachable.

507
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,839
You okay?

508
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,217
- Ms. Quinn-Goldberg?
- Yes.

509
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,719
- A moment?
- Yes. Thank you.

510
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,930
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

511
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,732
<i>How did I end up here?</i>

512
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,278
<i>Oh, I was coming here to hide the scarf.
Did he catch me trying to hide it?</i>

513
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,363
I'm sick.

514
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,324
I was having a fever dream.

515
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,453
I must have hopped your fence.

516
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,376
I've got the measles.

517
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,753
- So you really...
- I've been immunized.

518
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
Surprised you weren't.

519
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,299
<i>It's like he's waiting for me
to give myself away.</i>

520
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,177
<i>What would
a normal neighbor say right now?</i>

521
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,179
Yeah, me too. I should've known.

522
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,475
I have a few gaps in my childhood.

523
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
I'm sorry about your wife.

524
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:03,528
I considered coming over,
but I didn't wanna bother you.

525
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
<i>There's that look again.</i>

526
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
<i>Does he know I kissed Natalie?</i>

527
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,828
<i>Is he the reason the police are up my ass?</i>

528
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,498
- Natalie said you were becoming friends.
<i>- Shit.</i>

529
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,625
- You had a glass of wine.
<i>- Game over.</i>

530
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,296
Did she say anything to you
about going to visit her sister?

531
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,590
<i>Or he doesn't know anything.</i>

532
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,259
<i>He's just hoping
I can help him find his missing wife.</i>

533
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,510
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,054
She didn't mention it.

535
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,474
You should rest.

536
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,311
I gave you some Tylenol
to help bring down the fever.

537
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,355
<i>Is it possible Matthew's a nice guy?</i>

538
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,439
Thank you.

539
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,611
Sure.

540
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,121
- There's no updates on my son.
- What's wrong with your son?

541
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,248
He's sick too.

542
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,958
He's in the hospital.

543
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,754
What if he doesn't get better?

544
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,759
What if they get punished for our sins?

545
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,014
I think...

546
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,225
it's not punishment, it's...

547
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,563
They reflect our sins back at us
so clearly, it's blinding.

548
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,734
I never saw myself becoming a father.

549
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,696
Then I met Theo's mom.
People become dads all kinds of ways.

550
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,574
I was even kind of excited about it,
and Theo was a great kid.

551
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,828
But I was young and extremely ambitious.

552
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,333
I was a shitty stepdad
and he hated me for it.

553
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,006
But now his mom's remarried, new family,
and Theo hates her even more.

554
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,050
He's come back here almost by default.

555
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,136
Most of the time,
I still have no idea what I'm doing.

556
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,931
All I know is that he needs me.

557
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,936
He needs me on some primal level,
just like your son needs you.

558
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,071
Are you sure Natalie didn't say anything
to you about taking a trip?

559
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,863
I'm sure she's fine.

560
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,326
She's done this for attention,
and she's too embarrassed to come home.

561
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,080
You don't think
anything's happened to her, do you?

562
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>What have we done, Love?</i>

563
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,794
<i>I wanna help, but safest thing</i>

564
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:29,048
<i>is to let him stay silent and hang himself
in the court of public opinion.</i>

565
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,514
He's okay.

566
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,727
- He's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

567
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,270
<i>Henry's okay.</i>

568
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,940
<i>And I promised him
I'd be a good man, worthy.</i>

569
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,027
<i>I cannot frame an innocent man.
I can't do it.</i>

570
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,280
<i>I'd be killing a mockingbird.</i>

571
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,452
I know that you love Natalie,
but you're not talking to the press.

572
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,246
- I don't care about the press.
- You should.

573
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,166
If you don't tell your story,
they will tell it for you.

574
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,085
You can't be there for Theo
if you're behind bars.

575
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,724
Hey.

576
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,059
Oh, hey.

577
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:26,064
Oh, no, no.
I didn't realize you were sick too.

578
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,609
- You poor thing.
- It's okay. It's okay. I'm recovering.

579
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,987
- How is he?
- He misses his daddy.

580
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,577
Don't ever scare us like that again,
Mr. Dramatic.

581
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,789
I love you too much.

582
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,460
Did you do it?

583
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,547
<i>What you're really asking is
what kind of father I am.</i>

584
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,716
Wish you could go through the front.

585
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,802
- Reporters, I get it.
- Yeah.

586
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,971
- You sure I can't help you home?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

587
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,099
My wife and kid are coming back.

588
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,644
- You've done more than enough.
- Okay. Get home safe.

589
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,730
Don't wanna find you passed out
by the trash again.

590
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,609
Mm.

591
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,377
I did it.

592
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
But then...

593
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,801
I took it back.

594
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,178
Matthew's a decent man.

595
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,682
He already lost his wife.
If we send him to prison...

596
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,517
What kind of people would we be?

597
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,685
<i>Wow.</i>

598
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,562
<i>You get it.</i>

599
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,939
We're better than that.

600
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,650
We are.

601
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>What does it mean to be a good father?</i>

602
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,494
<i>To protect, yes.</i>

603
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,830
<i>But can you be a good father</i>

604
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,582
<i>if you're a bad man?</i>

605
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,544
<i>It's not the kind of father I wanna be
and the kind of mother you wanna be.</i>

606
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,627
<i>Thank God.</i>

607

<i>The whole town came.</i>

620
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,224
Is he gonna come out? I don't get it.

621
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,935
Is this some kind of strategy?

622

<i>Sherry and Kiki

<i>but that's so they could grab

00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,029
Let's go. Come on.

627
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,573
<i>I don't think Matthew wanted
to look even guiltier,</i>

628
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,243
<i>but not showing up to your wife's vigil...</i>

629
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,372
- Matthew.
- Matthew, sir.

630
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,999
He's out. Come on. Let's go. Camera up.

631
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,962
...ask you a couple
quick questions, Matthew?

632
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,304
It would mean a lot to Natalie to see
how many people came out here.

633
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,890
How many people care.

634
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,479
<i>It wasn't a strategy.</i>

635
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:58,192
<i>He waited so long
because he almost couldn't do it.</i>

636
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
<i>It's that hard for him to talk about her.</i>

637
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,738
<i>Because he cares.</i>

638
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,909
I am worried about my wife.
Natalie, if you're watching this,

639
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,744
please come home.

640
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,372
Or let me know you're okay.

641
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,585
<i>The truth is, Matthew doesn't have
to go down for this.</i>

642
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,962
We need you.

643
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
I need you.

644
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,225
And if somebody out there
has done something to my wife...

645
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,687
I will find you...

646
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,481
and you will be punished.

647
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,861
Thank you.

648
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,948
Has your wife ever left you before?

649
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,533
Have you notified her family?

650
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,702
Matthew, anything to...

651
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,247
That's it?

652
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,584
<i>Contrary to popular belief,
it's not always the husband.</i>

653
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,837
<i>But we're not going down for this either.</i>

654
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,674
<i>They've got nothing.
Even if they find something,</i>

655
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,092
<i>we'll take care of it.</i>

656
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,511
<i>We always do.</i>

657
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,105
Falco.

658
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,483
We found the ring.

659
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,776
Okay.

660
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,157
<i>It's been said,
"Nothing ever happens in the suburbs."</i>

661
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

662
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,878
It's an inadequate gesture
for making sure I didn't die last week.

663
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,048
Unnecessary. Thank you.
I'm glad you're better.

664
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,802
If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a call.

665
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,142
<i>Maybe it's more like,
"Nothing ever really changes."</i>

666
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,573
- Hey.
- You're not closed yet, are you?

667
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,369
No, Gil, hey. You're just in time.
What can I get you?

668
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,832
- How about half a dozen blueberry?
- Coming right up.

669
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,585
Hey, I haven't seen Margaret.

670
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,090
- Wanna tell her I said hi?
- Yeah, yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

671
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,175
Margaret would have come too,

672
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,887
but she took the girls to her mom's
while they're recovering.

673
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh. Were they sick?

674
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,141
Not anymore.

675
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,143
But they both had it.

676
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,813
Can't tell you how sorry we are
for exposing Henry.

677
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,984
Both your daughters had measles?

678
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,028
Margaret really regrets not saying
anything when you called.

679
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,323
She was just stunned to hear
that Henry had to be hospitalized.

680
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,742
Our girls were pretty minor.

681
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,204
We hope you won't hold it against us.

682
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,542
You see, we just don't believe
in subjecting kids

683
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,711
to toxic injections they don't need

684
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,380
to fight things
their bodies were created to fight.

685
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,842
We don't judge people who do, of course.

686
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,263
Anyway, I... Jeez.
I didn't come here to get on a soapbox.

687
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,057
Again, we apologize.

688
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,020
The most important thing is
that everyone is better now, right?

689
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,151
Thanks.

690
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,075
- Hey, Gil?
- Yep?
