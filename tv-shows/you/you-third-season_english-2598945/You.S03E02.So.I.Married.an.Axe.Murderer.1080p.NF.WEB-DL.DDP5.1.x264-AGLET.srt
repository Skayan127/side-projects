1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,394
<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,312
Henry Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

3
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,396
We're a family.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>Now that the baby's here,</i>

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.</i>

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,319
Hey, Natalie. Hi.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,363
<i>My heart's not really in it.</i>

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>How could it be when you stole it?</i>

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,453
<i>No. Husband, father. I can't.</i>

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,913
Sorry. I'm just looking for a friend.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,458
Everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,710
Even around Sherry and her mafia?

13
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,337
It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:51,051
- I have this fantasy of opening a bakery.
- There's a space available.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,011
Call me if you wanna see it.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,936
Natalie. I wanted to see
the place you were talking about.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,481
You can have this place up crazy fast.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,360
This place could be a raging success.
So, what do you think?

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,154
Hey, Love. Hey, you okay?

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,032
Joe, I think we need to go
to couples therapy.

21
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,089
So, what brings you in?

22
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,599
- What?!
- Shh. Don't wake him up.

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,853
Love, what did you do?

24
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,278
What did you do?

25
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,446
We had a fight.

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,616
Obviously.
You wouldn't be here if you hadn't.

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,868
Yeah. I caught him cheating.

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,288
<i>Good, we're diving right in.</i>

29
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,543
It's okay, Henry. I won't let
anything happen to you, I promise.

30
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,590
Love, I told you, nothing happened.

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,759
If anything, she came on to me.

32
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,969
You kept a box.

33
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,555
I know what that means.

34
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,306
I know you.

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,766
So you kill her?

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,186
Technically, I didn't cheat.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,271
"Technically"?

38
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,482
I caught him about to cheat.
It's the same thing.

39
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>The difference is
that I almost did a bad thing</i>

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,570
<i>and she did a terrible thing.</i>

41
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>I can't say what she did,
so I'm the villain.</i>

42
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
I'm not saying I'm blameless.

43
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,743
But she went crazy.

44
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,788
What does that mean, "crazy"?

45
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,512
<i>You're the shrink, that's your job.</i>

46
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,125
She flew off the handle...

47
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,086
and broke a vase.

48
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,172
A vase.

49
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,549
- It was priceless.
- Cheap and tacky.

50
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,009
Impossible to undo.

51
00:02:56,092 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>Don't fight, don't make it worse.
There's no telling how she'll react.</i>

52
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,389
Okay.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,726
I broke a vase.

54
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:10,982
It's just, sometimes, I get passionate.

55
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,066
What are you doing?

56
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,236
Her phone, Love.
Her trackable, traceable phone.

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,741
Did you even think about that
before you buried an ax in our neighbor?

58
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,037
No. No, I didn't plan it
like some psychopath.

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,496
I... Fuck.

60
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,417
There's this too.

61
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,335
I, um...

62
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,926
- I signed the lease for the bakery.
- You signed a lease for our crime scene?

63
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,302
Give me this.

64
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,640
I thought it would be good,
a reason I was here with her.

65
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,143
I know there's a mess to clean up,
but I couldn't leave

66
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,437
and let somebody come in here.
And now we have...

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,566
- You know, time to cover it up.
- We have no time. There's no time.

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,569
I'm not good at this.
You backed me into a corner,

69
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,114
- and I was trying to protect our family...
- Let me focus!

70
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,991
I got it!

71
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,707
So you have a new baby?

72
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,793
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Henry.

73
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,213
- Sometimes we call him Forty.
- His name's Henry.

74
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,966
<i>A good therapist would dig
into why our child is named</i>

75
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,093
<i>after her dead addict brother.</i>

76
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,513
So, Joe, how have you found
the transition to fatherhood?

77
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,849
<i>A tangle of dread and failure.
Oh, and, also, murder.</i>

78
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,101
It's great.

79
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,111
A little challenging.

80
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,155
- For both of us.
- For me more than him.

81
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,701
He's been... and he'd admit...

82
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,539
checked out, going through the motions.

83
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,335
And it's like, "Why...?
Why isn't his heart in it?

84
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,547
And why won't he try?"

85
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,426
- I have been trying.
- You're saying you've been all in?

86
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,430
When you're only truly present
maybe 50% of the time?

87
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>Textbook. She'd rather make it
about me and Henry</i>

88
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>than look at her part in this.</i>

89
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,437
Okay. Love, we need a story.

90
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,230
A reason she died.

91
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,693
She was unstable and unhappy,

92
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,904
- and she killed herself.
- With an ax?

93
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,282
She fell off a cliff
and hit her head. I don't know!

94
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,075
She needs to disappear.

95
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
Shh.

96
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,792
Never to be found, never to be autopsied.

97
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,421
Her phone, her iPad,
her car are impossible to hide.

98
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,090
So we need to move her...

99
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,971
things somewhere
and her body somewhere else.

100
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,555
Okay. Uh...

101
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,223
Where?

102
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,603
There's a state forest

103
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,605
30 minutes from here.

104
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,107
We bury her in the woods.

105
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,902
That worked so well with Candace.

106
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,912
I think, she's been holding
my past relationships against me.

107
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,039
Well, you do have a pattern.

108
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,707
<i>Don't bite, don't bite.</i>

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
And you don't?

110
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,669
You wanna throw Candace
in my face right now?

111
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,673
Okay. Okay. All right.
Let's talk about how we handled that.

112
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,302
What did you do with her body?
Or Delilah's, for that matter.

113
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,306
- Because you have never shared.
- I told you, I took care of it.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,434
And I am asking you
how you took care of it.

115
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,562
It's safer if you don't know, okay?

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,650
Shit! Okay.

117
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,820
You know, in L.A.,
there was this man named Jasper...

118
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,282
who came after me
because of Will Bettelheim's debts.

119
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,952
And he needed to disappear.

120
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,497
- What did you do?
- I broke him down into smaller parts.

121
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,791
- How? With, like, a saw?
- Yes.

122
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,002
Also, it was...
You know, eventually, it had to be...

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,256
In the end, a meat grinder was the way
to get him in a bag.

124
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,339
At Anavrin?

125
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,386
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,139
Are you fucking kidding me?

127
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,641
- I used that thing all the time!
- What is your idea?

128
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,768
Do you have a better one?
Of course you don't

129
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,146
because you murdered our neighbor
in a fit of rage.

130
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,731
No regard for the consequences.
This, today, Love, look.

131
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,275
This? You did this.

132
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,944
You put our family in danger, Love.

133
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,157
- Where are you going?
- To take care of the baby.

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,994
You can deal with Natalie. You cared more
about her than your own son anyway.

135
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,459
- Shh! It's okay. It's okay.
<i>- I was wrong, Natalie.</i>

136
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>I thought you were a threat
to my marriage.</i>

137
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,924
<i>But the real problem
with my marriage is my fucking wife.</i>

138
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:59,604
- So we don't know where to go from here.
- "You" don't know where to go from here.

139
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,982
He may not know either,
but when you speak in "we,"

140
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,069
you leave no room
for his individual experience or yours.

141
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,907
The "we" is codependence
masquerading as love.

142
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,990
I'm...

143
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,868
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

144
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,913
If you don't know
how to communicate healthily,

145
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,915
it's because it was never modeled for you.

146
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,959
<i>Oh, funny,
it's already "blame-the-parents o'clock."</i>

147
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,461
I'll be honest with you.

148
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,882
I don't think this fight has anything
to do with Joe's so-called cheating.

149
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,008
<i>She doesn't?</i>

150
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,927
- You don't?
- Mm-mm. Not really.

151
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,639
Do you know what it is about?

152
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,266
Not yet. But keep talking.

153
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,773
So why don't you tell me
what you went through, alone,

154
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,399
in the aftermath of the argument.

155
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,320
- Well, I...
- Actually...

156
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
I'd like to hear from Joe first.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,366
<i>She would?</i>

158
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,744
<i>Maybe she can sense the inequity here.</i>

159
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,875
Yeah, well, like I said, nothing was ever
going to happen with this woman.

160
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,836
But, after the fight,

161
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,547
I felt obligated...

162
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,801
to get rid of her for good.

163
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,094
"Obligated"?

164
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,762
Forced.

165
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,222
By your wife?

166
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,014
Yes.

167
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
How did that make you feel?

168
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,523
<i>Fuck Love. Fuck her. Fuck this.</i>

169
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>Fuck whoever made these bags.</i>

170
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,278
<i>Where is that little perforated line?
Which end is it?</i>

171
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,160
<i>I should let Love take the fall for this.
But, no, she knows what I've done.</i>

172
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,037
<i>She knows me. Fuck marriage!</i>

173
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
<i>All right, Natalie.</i>

174
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,466
<i>This is the story of your disappearance.</i>

175
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,218
<i>You show my wife the bakery.</i>

176
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>She signs a lease.</i>

177
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,140
<i>An hour later, you text your husband.</i>

178
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>No emoji, no emotion,
like the rest of your texts with Matthew.</i>

179
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,104
<i>It's terse, all business.</i>

180
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>The rental in question is
a cute cabin you manage,</i>

181
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,901
<i>30 minutes out on the border
of the state forest.</i>

182
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,571
<i>Your car, phone, iPad,</i>

183
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,824
<i>and all their invasive
location-tracking technologies will take</i>

184
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>a scenic drive to the property.</i>

185
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,916
<i>Your body is headed somewhere else
but more on that in a moment.</i>

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,377
<i>Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck my life.</i>

187
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>No, no, stop. Reel it in. Think of Henry.</i>

188
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,341
<i>I cannot get this wrong.</i>

189
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,509
<i>The point is, Natalie,</i>

190
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>although your stuff will make it
to the cabin, you simply disappear.</i>

191
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,476
<i>Your last text will be to your sister,
suggesting you are deeply unhappy,</i>

192
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,103
<i>leaving plenty of room for interpretation.</i>

193
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,315
<i>Rumor: Did you leave
your cold and distant husband?</i>

194
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,361
<i>Were you abducted? Assume a new identity?
Who can ever say for sure?</i>

195
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,574
<i>And in the event
there are traffic cameras in town...</i>

196
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,665
So you put an end to the other woman
and you feel...

197
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,292
Emasculated.

198
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,300
<i>Here's the problem
my wife left us to clean up.</i>

199
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>Natalie, your trackables
and your body need to part ways</i>

200
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>somewhere a person would
reasonably pull over if they were alive.</i>

201
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,143
<i>And then, well... Then I need to find
some magically perfect place</i>

202
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,853
<i>to leave you forever.</i>

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,235
<i>Burying you in the woods is
the best I've got.</i>

204
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,260
<i>If she wanted it her way,
she should have done the hard part.</i>

205
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,742
<i>This isn't me though.</i>

206
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
<i>I put this behind me.</i>

207
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,664
<i>I changed... You know what's funny?</i>

208
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,249
<i>For Love. For her.</i>

209
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>Because I wanted to be good enough
for her. And look at me now.</i>

210
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,592
<i>I'm worried about Henry.</i>

211
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,304
<i>I don't recognize Love anymore.</i>

212
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>I don't even recognize myself.</i>

213
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
<i>Maybe you were on to something, Natalie.</i>

214
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,782
<i>Kids aren't handcuffs.</i>

215
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,706
<i>When I'm done cleaning up Love's mess,
I am packing my bags,</i>

216
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,251
<i>taking Henry and getting the fuck out.</i>

217
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,588
You were going to leave me?

218
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,591
- Are you insane?
- Uh-uh.

219
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,674
No.

220
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
You must listen.

221
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,388
I am listening, every word. How...?

222
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,141
There's a difference
between a reaction and a response.

223
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,561
The latter is thoughtful,
the former, impulsive.

224
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,189
Why does everybody think I'm impulsive?

225
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,399
Who is "everybody"?

226
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,151
<i>You know, she's good.</i>

227
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,737
Uh...

228
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,860
Does someone else make you feel like this?

229
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
Good morning. Hello?

230
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,370
Hey, Mom.

231
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,041
Hey.

232
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,087
Sleepy Forty.

233
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,131
Aren't you a little gift?

234
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,425
Why didn't you answer my calls?

235
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,885
Oh, I've been busy.

236
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,514
I signed a new lease
on a cute little bakery in town.

237
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,932
- A bakery?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,267
I need to head to the market.
Can you watch him?

239
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,729
He should be down for a nap.
I need to start stocking the shop.

240
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,231
Hold on. A bakery?

241
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,235
- In a town that's peak keto?
- Yeah, yeah. I will convert them.

242
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,488
I told you
that Quinn family finances were in flux.

243
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,156
We'll figure it out.

244
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,491
As in,

245
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,831
I can't guarantee
I can help you with a lease, financially.

246
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,085
Mom, that is very different
than vaguely mentioning "flux."

247
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,004
It's a three-year lease
with a huge deposit.

248
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,007
I would have told you
if you'd taken the time to ask.

249
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,510
Is this another one of your episodes?

250
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,846
"Episodes"?

251
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,516
You know, it all feels a tad impulsive.

252
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,519
So, what is it about these...

253
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,606
labels that are so hurtful?

254
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,028
Well, it's like...

255
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,447
nobody gets me.

256
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,450
Why I do things, how I do them.

257
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,205
It's like, I just wanna be
a good role model for my child.

258
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,583
And that means doing more.

259
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,502
Stay with the feeling. "Nobody gets you."

260
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:46,051
<i>Shit. It's hard to stay angry
when she's so... But what's not to get?</i>

261
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,013
<i>She's relatable except for the part
where she's an ax murderer.</i>

262
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,224
<i>Is that gettable? Is it my fault
if I don't want to get that?</i>

263
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,308
Um...

264
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,938
I just remembered this moment at the...

265
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,275
at the store.

266
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,071
- Fuck.
- I got you.

267
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,199
- There you go. You need a...?
- Thank you.

268
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,577
- Need a hand with any of this?
- No, I'm good.

269
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
All right.

270
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,333
Shameless.

271
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,669
Yeah.

272
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,924
I'm a fem-gen major
if that's any comfort at all.

273
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,719
It's Feminist Gender
and Sexuality Studies.

274
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,846
So I aim to be fluent.

275
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
- Nice.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,101
I'm Theo, by the way. What's your name?

277
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,982
I'm married.
And half these groceries are for my baby.

278
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,736
Yeah, yeah, if there's one thing
I know about babies,

279
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,196
they really love yeast.

280
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,239
They just guzzle the stuff.

281
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,534
- That's for the bakery I'm opening.
- Oh, shit. Where is it?

282
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,498
- Um, off Main Street, near Town Square.
- Okay.

283
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,084
- Oh, where Sweet Dreams used to be.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,127
Before that, it was Curry Home for Dinner.

285
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,380
So the pun name is a requisite.

286
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
- Okay.
- Yeah.

287
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,967
- You're from here?
- I am, I am.

288
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,344
And you are new in town.

289
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,139
They haven't converted you
to full-time athleisure yet.

290
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Congratulations.

291
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
Oh.

292
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,936
Yeah, L.A. runs strong in these veins.

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,771
Damn, girl.

294
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,150
So you got a new town, new baby,

295
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,987
new bakery, banging body.

296
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,657
You're just doing it all.

297
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,868
It's a tax.

298
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,794
What were you feeling when
this stranger paid you so much attention?

299
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,006
Guilty.

300
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,050
'Cause it felt so good.

301
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,762
And then really sad

302
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,433
'cause I didn't want that from a stranger.

303
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,309
I wanted that from my husband.

304
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,439
<i>And just like that,
she's the victim again. Masterful.</i>

305
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,399
How does that sit with you?

306
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,402
I'm flattered.

307
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,529
Mm.

308
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,074
Your face tells a different story.

309
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
If anything, you seem repulsed.

310
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,203
<i>Dumb, back-stabbing face.</i>

311
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,872
No. What...? No.

312
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:24,960
No, no, no. Look, I haven't been
as present as I would like...

313
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,421
lately.

314
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,214
Parenthood is an adjustment.

315
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
But I'm...

316
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,013
- I'm here, right?
- True.

317
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,515
Maybe being here is already
a radical concession,

318
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,893
given you were on the verge
of leaving for good.

319
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,521
So why didn't you?

320
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,439
Leave her?

321
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Maybe I'll take Henry some place
like this lovely rental cabin of yours.</i>

322
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,033
<i>Pretty, quiet.</i>

323
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>You could have helped me vanish, Natalie.
But now... it's time to vanish you.</i>

324
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,666
<i>Your husband won't suspect
you're missing for a day.</i>

325
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,002
<i>All that remains is
a cryptic text to your sister,</i>

326
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,341
<i>then I gotta hike ten miserable miles,
catch a ride home and start packing.</i>

327
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,343
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

328
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,680
<i>"Tell me I shouldn't fuck
the boring neighbor"?</i>

329
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,642
<i>"Boring neighbor"?</i>

330
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,313
<i>Is that all I was to you?</i>

331
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,982
<i>Is that all you were?</i>

332
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,196
<i>A restless housewife? A stereotype?
Maybe Love was right about you.</i>

333
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,785
<i>No, no, no. She had no right to kill you.
Still, things could've gotten messy fast.</i>

334
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,789
<i>Maybe I would've made a mess.
Maybe Love was right. No, she wasn't.</i>

335
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>- Shit.
- It's not a trick question.</i>

336
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,294
Why didn't you run?

337
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,050
Well, because...

338
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,142
I couldn't convince myself
that Henry would be better off.

339
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,478
He needs both of us.

340
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,859
So you stayed for the child,
not for your wife.

341
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
Unfortunately, that's our time for today.

342
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,243
I'm giving you homework.

343
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,539
"How to talk."

344
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,794
The reflective listening exercise will
help structure difficult conversations.

345
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,714
Slow down, respond...

346
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,675
- instead of react.
<i>- That's Love's homework.</i>

347
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>Mine is to prevent her
from murdering this therapist.</i>

348
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
And I'd like to see you
as soon as possible,

349
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,185
given we are in a bit
of a triage situation.

350
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,686
Is it that bad?

351
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,647
You want me to tell you
whether or not you should be together.

352
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,487
The truth is, the easiest thing is
to end this marriage.

353
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,824
Either one of you have
the power to do it tonight.

354
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,828
You must choose to stay together
every minute from now until death,

355
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,538
and that takes a lot of will

356
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,041
and something both of you are willing
to fight for.

357
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,086
So far, I've only heard you fight
to be right.

358
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,964
You need a deeper purpose.

359
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>Henry. If nothing else, Love and I...</i>

360
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,802
And don't say "Henry."

361
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,639
If children were enough reason
to stay married,

362
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,016
we'd have no divorced parents.

363
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,099
<i>Shit.</i>

364
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,818
<i>What's the only thing worse
than couples therapy?</i>

365
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,695
<i>Coming home afterward.</i>

366
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,409
<i>Dr. Chandra's "How to talk" worksheet is
mostly about how to listen,</i>

367
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,995
<i>which may be useful if we ever talk again.</i>

368
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,832
Okay, so Sherry's wedding cake
was lemon-raspberry.

369
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,462
So I think that gluten-free, sugar-free,

370
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,716
fucking happiness-free cupcakes,
that should be a safe bet.

371
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,303
Andrew and Jackson's kid's party.

372
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,473
We're still going to that?
Don't you think that...?

373
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,767
Wait. Do you have some packing
and running to do?

374
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me try it again. I'm sorry.

375
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,576
What I'm hearing is that you think

376
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,997
that Natalie and us should be
the only people

377
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,001
who mysteriously
don't attend today's party.

378
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,711
<i>Not better.</i>

379
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
- That's not what I'm saying.
- No?

380
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,134
What I'm hearing is that you would
really like some alone time.

381
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,387
So I'm gonna go take Henry
and let you work in peace.

382
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,058
Not what I said.

383
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,950
You two again.

384
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,493
Yes, us again.

385
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,329
There you go.

386
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,165
That was a quick read.

387
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,876
Need me to find another beautiful woman
to recommend the next one?

388
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,544
I already found one.

389
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,256
I was hoping you could show me
the rare books section.

390
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,175
What makes you think we have one?

391
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,427
<i>A dumbwaiter indicates a basement</i>

392
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,305
<i>where a mole-rat person looks after
the valuable books.</i>

393
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,639
<i>But I'm guessing...</i>

394
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,683
We don't have anyone down there right now.

395
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,809
Okay, yeah.

396
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,437
Well, maybe you could escort us.

397
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,105
We'll be very quick.

398
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,398
I promise.

399
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,117
And here we are.

400
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,996
<i>Yikes. These poor books.</i>

401
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,540
You looking for anything specific?

402
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,753
You know what,
I think I'll know it when I see it.

403
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,046
Mind if I take a look?

404
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,381
- Please.
- Okay.

405
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
I thought you said
no one worked down here.

406
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,394
Oh, I do, sometimes.

407
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,396
When it's slow upstairs.

408
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,356
<i>Interesting. Keep her talking.</i>

409
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,109
So... you're an artist.

410
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm a librarian who draws.

411
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,571
Looks like more than that to me.

412
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>Anything other
than Victorian science books down here?</i>

413
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,368
Okay, nosy.

414
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,037
I illustrate books sometimes.

415
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,332
- It's just a side hustle though.
<i>- Bingo.</i>

416
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,673
So is there anywhere that I can see
your work, like online maybe or...?

417
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,299
Why?

418
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,470
- You write a kids' book?
- No, I'm just a connoisseur.

419
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,554
Here we go.

420
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>Wildflowers of New York.</i>

421
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:02,065
Do you need a 100-year-old gardening book
instead of a new one upstairs?

422
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,943
Nothing beats the classics.
I can have this back in a few days.

423
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,279
No. You're not supposed
to take these ones home.

424
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,072
Okay. I can read it upstairs.

425
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,992
I think he should calm down
in just a bit. Right, Henry?

426
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,702
That's okay. Just take it.

427
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,830
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

428
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,665
<i>Glad someone's got my back.</i>

429
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,753
<i>Less than ideal to steal, of course.</i>

430
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,507
<i>But Ellie needs cash,
and I can't touch Quinn funds</i>

431
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,343
<i>for fear of them finding out where she is.</i>

432
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,057
<i>And let's be honest,
it feels good to fix something.</i>

433
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>Especially when everything else feels
so unfixable.</i>

434
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,231
Oh, shit. I knew it, we're late.

435
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,400
<i>What am I fighting for?
What am I fighting for?</i>

436
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,903
<i>- Is this really the life I want?</i>
- Hi.

437
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,280
- Welcome.
<i>- The only thing worse than a kid's party</i>

438
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
<i>is a rich kid's party.</i>

439
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,793
A little bit to the right.

440
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,004
One more.

441
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,631
Oh, you're early.

442
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,508
Hi. Yeah, I...

443
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,052
- We thought that...
- Oh, it's fine. Fine.

444
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,137
Most of the gang's here to help set up.

445
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,222
Um...

446
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,060
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna put these somewhere.

447
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,647
Hey, boys! Look who's here.

448
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,776
- Hey!
- Yo, Joe! Let's get you drunk!

449
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,028
Stop. But seriously...

450
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,407
- how drunk do you wanna be for this?
- Love!

451
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,618
- We didn't think we'd see you today.
- Oh.

452
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,288
- You left in such a hurry the other night.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry for ghosting.

453
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,500
My mom was watching the baby,
and Dottie has an expiration time.

454
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,502
Alcohol? Pills?

455
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,257
It's no judgment. I could only imagine
what she's been through. Oh!

456
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,678
I could cry right now.
Being a mom of twins...

457
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,723
Losing one would be like... losing both.

458
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,768
I made cupcakes.

459
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,520
- You made those?
- Gorgeous.

460
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:08,358
Yes. I am also opening a bakery.
A cute little spot on Main Street.

461
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,443
I love that.

462
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
So brave.

463
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,323
You've heard
that spot hasn't had much success,

464
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,242
- but it's never had you, mama.
- Yeah.

465
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,287
I was hoping you lovelies would be
my guinea pigs.

466
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,377
Don't worry, they're organic
and, like, everything-free.

467
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,879
They're lemon-raspberry.

468
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:34,926
You know, I'm not really a fan
of lemon or raspberry.

469
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,431
- Already hit my macro.
- I'm fasting.

470
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,599
Oh!

471
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,892
We should get our kids in their costumes.

472
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
<i>Screw your liver.</i>

473
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,150
Seventy percent of G-clearance happens
in the peripheral tissue.

474
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,321
<i>This is what fun looks like
in Madre Linda: glorified productivity.</i>

475
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,365
<i>I want the best for my son.
No denying, this beats a group home,</i>

476
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,201
<i>but there's gotta be
a third bowl of porridge.</i>

477
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,828
Bottom line, 45-minute orgasm.

478
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,456
- No way.
- Sick. I'll invest.

479
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,583
<i>Things I've learned
in the past ten minutes:</i>

480
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>ejaculating too much can deplete focus,
so Cary patented "injaculating."</i>

481
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,633
Sherry started nicknaming me
"The Stallion."

482
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,677
<i>And Gil is only
a hair less outsider than me.</i>

483
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:22,015
<i>Judging by the gasps he gives
every time Cary says the word "ejaculate,"</i>

484
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,309
<i>I'd guess that Gil waited till marriage.</i>

485
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,062
- Daddy! Daddy!
<i>- Thank you, tiny intruder.</i>

486
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,230
Hey. Having fun?
I want you to meet someone.

487
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,067
This is Joe. Joe, this is Zoe. Zoe, Joe.

488
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,362
I've seen you at the library.
I read to the kids there.

489
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,155
You and Henry should join. It's fun.

490
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,531
- We can carpool.
- Maybe.

491
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,868
<i>Rather lose another finger than carpool
with Mormon Neville Longbottom.</i>

492
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,038
<i>So far, nothing about this place
worth fighting for.</i>

493
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,166
- Oh, my God!
- Uh-oh. Sherry's siren song.

494
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,251
Duty calls, men.

495
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,129
Don't eat sugar! Honey, no!

496
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,006
Go ahead. I can watch the little guy.

497
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,841
Yeah? Okay. Thank you.

498
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,010
- Sure, no problem.
<i>- Nice guy.</i>

499
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,721
<i>Maybe I'm still looking
for reasons to run.</i>

500
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,766
Get that... No, baby. Oh, baby girl, no!

501
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,561
You have completely spiked
their blood sugar, Love.

502
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,065
- No, they're sugar-free.
- There's sugar in raspberries.

503
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,068
- We don't let them eat fruit. Come on.
- Oh.

504
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,821
Let's go, babies. This way.

505
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,782
Cary, I am so sorry.

506
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,867
That's fine. They're kids.

507
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,831
Hey, I'll give the wife
a little you-know-what later,

508
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,792
and she'll just lose all memory of this.

509
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,338
Don't worry. I got the twins wearing
those Vital Rings of Matthew's.

510
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,423
<i>Matthew...</i>

511
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,592
See?

512
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,220
Heart rates and blood sugar,
totally normal.

513
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,598
Does this have GPS?

514
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,351
Oh, yeah. Leave it to Matthew.

515
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,771
He could give a shit about your health,
he's just horny for the data.

516
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,983
It's pretty spotty,
but it gives you the general idea.

517
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
- We all wear them.
<i>- No.</i>

518
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,696
<i>No, no.</i>

519
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,950
<i>If Matthew has access to Natalie's ring,
he'll be able to see exactly where she is.</i>

520
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,036
Do you think they could see
that her heart stopped?

521
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
- I didn't invent the fucking ring.
- Stop!

522
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,333
Hey. Hey, man.

523
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,754
No, listen to me.
We need to stop production, then.

524
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,517
<i>He hasn't put it together yet,
but it's only a matter of time.</i>

525
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,886
<i>Natalie's been gone over 24 hours.
Our window is rapidly closing.</i>

526
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,691
- What? Are you bringing him?
- Wanna leave him in the car?

527
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,485
That's Bad Parenting 101.

528
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,032
Witnessing us dig up a body isn't?

529
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,077
He has barely any depth perception,
which you should know.

530
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:54,709
What I'm hearing is, even as I am doing
everything in my power to save my child,

531
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,003
my parenting skills aren't up
to your standards.

532
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,838
Is this important right now?

533
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,145
Oh, fuck!

534
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,651
Why does she look like that?

535
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,487
I had to remove her teeth.

536
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,659
Right. Dental records. Yeah.

537
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,412
Where did you put them?

538
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,542
The teeth? Don't wanna find them
in a hidey-hole in my house.

539
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,586
You won't. It's safer if you don't know.

540
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,516
- What?
- Might want to wait in the car with Henry.

541
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,726
I can handle it. Just fucking do it.

542
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,769
<i>We'll see.</i>

543
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,078
It's cracked. Maybe that's good.

544
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,415
Could've just broken when...
In the bakery when she fell.

545
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,541
But what if it didn't?

546
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,670
Still have to move it.
The body can't be where the ring died.

547
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,130
- So just...
- Yeah.

548
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,615
I put the ring on the sink
so it looked like she washed her hands.

549
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,743
What now?

550
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,496
I know where to go.

551
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,843
You said we needed a permanent solution.
We're on the edge of town.

552
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
They're pouring a foundation tomorrow.

553
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,557
Under a slab of cement is permanent.

554
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,226
- How did you know we'd rebury her?
- I didn't.

555
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,481
I drove past it yesterday,
so I looked into it. A backup plan.

556
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,526
How many of those do you have?

557
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,489
Do you just drive around
making mental notes

558
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,784
of good places to disappear people?

559
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,703
Considering who I'm married to, yeah.

560
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,081
I kind of have to.

561
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,666
Oh, I'm the psycho.

562
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,086
How did you get rid of her so fast?
How did you know where to go?

563
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,839
- What were you planning for?
- What are you insinuating?

564
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,727
<i>Why is she doing this now?
We have a body to take care of.</i>

565
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,563
<i>If this is a partnership,
I'm better off alone.</i>

566
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,984
- Love?
- Why don't you love me anymore?!

567
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,612
- You know why, you just won't say it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

568
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,824
You had a hook to my throat.
And then I said I was pregnant.

569
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,494
And then we just went on
and pretended like it didn't happen.

570
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,456
No, no, no, we didn't!
It was a bad moment. For both of us.

571
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,918
- It was a bad moment a lifetime ago.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

572
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,587
You act all pure and noble,

573
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,757
like you have reasons
for what you do when you do it.

574
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,968
But when I do it, I'm crazy, right?

575
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,012
I'm some manic nutjob.

576
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,388
"But, oh, wait! Oh, wait!

577
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,433
She's a mom now,
I guess I can't slit her throat."

578
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,981
He... is the only reason I'm alive.

579
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,485
How do you think that makes me feel?
I can't trust you.

580
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,780
I can't trust you either!

581
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,323
I was trying to...

582
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,535
Yes, yes. Yes, I did things.

583
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,707
But I've worked hard to be better
and I am not that person anymore.

584
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,790
But now,

585
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,795
I will be burying bodies
until I'm 70 years old!

586
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,008
Because if I'm not 100% into you
all of the time,

587
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,386
you will keep killing people!

588
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,390
If I'm not enough for you, you'll kill me.

589
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,267
You said that out loud?

590
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,438
I want you to listen closely.

591
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,942
Fifty percent of my married clients want
to kill each other.

592
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
It's normal.

593
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,112
And here's the better news,

594
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,198
neither one of you is gonna kill
your spouse.

595
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,326
You're many things,
but you are not murderers.

596
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,165
The intensity here is a very good sign.

597
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,044
You're not fighting to be right,
you're fighting for your lives.

598
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,338
Deeper. Right?

599
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,466
- <i>Scarier.</i>
- Joe.

600
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,887
Can you think of any times
when you felt as violent as you did

601
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,639
toward Love in your fight?

602
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,184
A few.

603
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,062
No, I'm pregnant!

604
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,232
I'm not a violent person.

605
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,986
What if sometimes you are?
What if that's normal?

606
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,284
Stop. Stop!

607
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,622
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

608
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,165
I believe you.

609
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,544
So, what's the feeling under the rage?

610
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,465
Fear.

611
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,425
Fear that...?

612
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
Joe, stay with the violent thoughts.

613
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,519
You're broken. I could never love you.

614
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,854
You're crazy!

615
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,815
What did you do? What did you do?

616
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,401
If someone...

617
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,195
sees me...

618
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,990
- Why does she look like that?
- I had to remove her teeth.

619
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,576
If someone sees the real me...

620
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,664
they'll go away.

621
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,665
For good.

622
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,053
What about you, Love?

623
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,642
When else have you felt the way
that Joe makes you feel?

624
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,194
When I feel...

625
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,907
- protective.
- What are you fighting to protect?

626
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,160
- My family.
- Why specifically family?

627
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,828
That's what you do.

628
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,208
What do you get from your family?

629
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,584
I don't know.

630
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,840
A family is supposed to...

631
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,760
love you unconditionally.

632
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,720
Why is that so important?

633
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,973
Why does love have to be unconditional?

634
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,354
Because if anyone...

635
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,523
saw...

636
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:22,823
how ugly I can be...

637
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,329
They'll go away for good.

638
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,930
Fair to say one of the things
you have in common

639
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:52,311
is fear of abandonment so deep,
it feels downright kill-or-be-killed.

640
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,355
Metaphorically speaking.

641
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,774
When our patterns line up like this,

642
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,111
it's very, very hard
to see the other person

643
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,322
because it's dangerously close
to looking in a mirror.

644
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:08,119
<i>We're talking about
the worst things, so why do I feel relief?</i>

645
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,204
So how are we, um...

646
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,331
I'm sorry. Joe and I.

647
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,459
...supposed to make this work?

648
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,005
That's the perfect word.

649
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,424
"Work." Because that's what it takes.

650
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,468
Let go of unconditional.
There's no such thing.

651
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,305
There's agreeing
to show up the best we can.

652
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,849
In the best marriages,

653
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,810
each partner challenges the other
every day

654
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,979
to be a better version of themselves.

655
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,315
- Sounds like a lot of fighting.
- Sure.

656
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,567
But is all fighting bad?

657
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,362
Maybe this isn't two opponents in a ring.

658
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,782
Maybe this is two on the same team

659
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,243
fighting for the same thing.

660
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,205
That sounds good.

661
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,711
Having someone on my... team.

662
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,963
Yeah.

663
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,175
Yeah, that sounds nice.

664
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,764
There you go.

665
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,811
You know what else
they don't tell you about teammates?

666
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,521
The sex is better.

667
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,692
Like, "Don't bother to describe it
to your unmarried friends" better.

668
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,487
The passion fueled by the deepest trust.

669
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,156
And it's fucking primal.

670
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,251
<i>A team.</i>

671
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:43,130
<i>Is that what this could be?
It does sound really nice.</i>

672
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,345
<i>Love knows me better than anyone ever has.</i>

673
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:53,182
<i>I'm starting to understand
why that's so terrifying.</i>

674
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,268
Joe. Joe!

675
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,189
- Hey.
- What, what, what?

676
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
Look.

677
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,569
Oh.

678
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,238
Oh. Wow.

679
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,781
I think they're the Shermans'.

680
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,367
They put up "lost bunny" signs
the other day.

681
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,370
Look, the mom is protecting her babies.

682
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,541
Look at the bunnies, Henry.
Henry, look at the bunnies.

683
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,674
Must've gone through there.
I had no idea there was a hole.

684
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,968
Henry...

685
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,096
Do you like that?

686
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,064
<i>And just like that, there you are.</i>

687
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,694
<i>The girl... The woman I fell in love with.</i>

688
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,826
<i>Warm, playful, honest,
and beautifully, radiantly maternal.</i>

689
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,331
<i>I'm such a fool. I've been distant, cruel.</i>

690
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>How can you ever forgive me?</i>

691
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,420
I'm so sorry about what I said. Um...

692
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,548
Of course you love our son.

693
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,468
Of course that you are all in with him.

694
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,886
It's not just him.

695
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,514
It's not just our son.

696
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,191
<i>This is new.</i>

697
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,066
<i>Exciting.</i>

698
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,278
<i>The joy of being a team.</i>

699
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,574
<i>And I'd be remiss if I didn't admit,</i>

700
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,243
<i>we have an excellent therapist.</i>

701
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,943
I have to tell you something.

702
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,823
I would absolutely kill for you.

703
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,459
Love, I would kill for you too.

704
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,088
And Henry.

705
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,631
Okay, so...

706
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,886
I promise to do everything I can...

707
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,307
to make sure you never have to do that.

708
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,477
I promise too.

709
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,066
Never again.

710
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,068
Thank you.

711
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,492
Love.

712
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:05,874
There are going to be things
out of our control, so...

713
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,044
I'm thinking about a way we can...

714
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,966
help each other
to make sure we never go there.

715
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,803
We can make a safe space.

716
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,763
A safe space?

717
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,560
It's very therapized.

718
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,643
Mm.

719
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,357
What'd you have in mind?

720
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,865
<i>Even with therapy,
our wounds may take a long time to heal.</i>

721
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,284
<i>We can't just erase our worst impulses.</i>

722
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,078
<i>But maybe we can control them.</i>

728
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:16,236

- This gonna become an everyday thing?
- I hope so.

745
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,078
What did you do?

746
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,624
I couldn't help but notice
your rare books need some attention, so...

747
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,462
I have expertise in that area.

748
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,338
Oh, so you want a job.

749
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,177
Well, you know you need a Master's
to work in a library, but...

750
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,428
<i>Do you though?</i>

751
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,973
I will think about it.

752
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,434
Thanks.

753
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,050
Cement is set.

754
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,260
We're in the clear.

755
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,474
- Anything from next door?
- Not that I can see.

756
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,727
She's been gone for days.

757
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,229
He's gotta know by now.

758
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,398
I wish I knew what he was thinking.

759
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,247
Hmm. You.

760
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,625
What are you doing here?

761
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,919
I own the place.

762
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,963
Hang on a second.
Theo, who's there?

763
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,967
- Oh, hi, Love.
- Hi, Matthew.

764
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,760
Uh, Natalie's not here right now.

765
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,306
Oh, no, I came here to see you.
I came here to see both of you.

766
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,434
- I did. I brought you some cupcakes.
- Thank you.

767
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,353
Love, this is my son, Theo.

768
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,482
- I didn't know you had a son.
- Stepson from my first marriage.

769
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,026
Thank you, but we're dealing
with something right now.

770
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,652
Let's go.

771
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,697
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

772
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,365
Have a good night.

773
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,135
So?

774
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,144
So... they know.

775
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,563
Shit's about to hit the fan.

776
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,611
<i>We've got this. Together.</i>
