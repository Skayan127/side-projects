1
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>I've always believed in The One.</i>

2
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>That there's someone out there for me.</i>

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>A perfect match, a soulmate.</i>

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>And for The One, I would do anything.</i>

5
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>I've had my heart broken more than once.</i>

6
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,829
Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

7
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,123
<i>And things haven't always
been easy in my life.</i>

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,791
What did you do?

9
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>But all that felt worth it
when I met Love Quinn.</i>

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,468
I wolf you.

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>I loved her.</i>

12
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>I embraced all of her,
even the hard parts.</i>

13
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,142
All you ever have to do is keep
your brother safe. You failed.

14
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,563
<i>But I was wrong... about Love.</i>

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,776
Find a city. When you get there,
I'll help you get legal ID,

16
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,652
I will send you money, not abandon you.

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,612
Burn in hell.

18
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>And by then, it was too late.</i>

19
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,824
We can be together now.

20
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,326
I don't think we can.

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,704
- <i>Really, really, truly.</i>
- No, I'm pregnant!

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>And then I realized
who I really need to protect.</i>

23
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>Our daughter.</i>

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,838
<i>For her, I moved to some soulless,</i>

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,882
<i>wealthy suburb outside San Francisco.</i>

26
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,968
<i>For her, I'd marry the monster,
her mother.</i>

27
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>For her, I'd lock myself into this prison.</i>

28
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,434
<i>Not sure how I'm ever going
to get us both out.</i>

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>But there's one part of the old me
I can't quite shake.</i>

30
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,110
<i>I still believe in The One.</i>

31
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>That the right person is out there for me.</i>

32
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>I never thought to wonder
what happens after boy gets girl.</i>

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,419
<i>'Cause we know:</i>

34
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,756
<i>"And they lived happily ever after."</i>

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,509
<i>Fade to black, roll credits.</i>

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,346
<i>I should have asked more questions.</i>

37
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>'Cause I've been in
some harrowing situations in my life.</i>

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,351
<i>But this?</i>

39
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,312
<i>I could really use a map.</i>

40
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,231
Joe. Joe.

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,525
That's your cue.

42
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,194
It's time to cut the umbilical cord.

43
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>But I've forged my way
in the dark before, I can do it now.</i>

44
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,702
<i>I have to.</i>

45
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,663
<i>To protect my daughter.</i>

46
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,748
Congratulations, Dad. It's a boy.

47
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,712
- It's a boy?
- Hey.

48
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,964
- Hi.
<i>- I'm fucked.</i>

49
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,009
<i>And so is he.</i>

50
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,690
- Careful. Careful.
- And what's our future president's name?

51
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,525
Henry.

52
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,235
Does he have a middle name?

53
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,363
Forty Quinn-Goldberg.

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,532
We were told it would be a girl.

55
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,284
Oh, probably just shy.

56
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,370
- Kept the goods hidden.
- Karma. God owed us a boy.

57
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>As I was saying, fucked.</i>

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,848
<i>Now that the baby's here,</i>

59
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,936
<i>at least our white picket purgatory
feels logical.</i>

60
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,856
<i>We moved to Madre Linda
for the schools, after all.</i>

61
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,861
<i>When that patented NorCal fog burns off,
you can see for miles.</i>

62
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,155
<i>Miles of nosy neighbors,
peering suspiciously</i>

63
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>from behind lawn care equipment
and video doorbells.</i>

64
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,038
<i>But, hey, safest neighborhood
in the Golden State.</i>

65
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,666
<i>And who wouldn't sell their soul for that?</i>

66
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,794
<i>We have everything.</i>

67
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>So he has everything.</i>

68
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,467
<i>The perfect family,
funded by Quinn blood money.</i>

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,594
<i>We wanted to get here all on our own.</i>

70
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>You compromise when you have to,
when it's for them.</i>

71
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,849
Welcome home, Forty.

72
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,893
Maybe we can use his real name.

73
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,065

00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>I don't let myself think
about who Love is, what she is.</i>

156
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>My job is to be a good husband
so I can be a good father.</i>

157
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,773
Hey, Natalie!

158
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,733
Hi.

159
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,297
I don't get what her problem is.

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,967
- What? Who?
- Our neighbor, Natalie.

161
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,846
She didn't give us a housewarming gift,
nothing when Forty was born.

162
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
Henry. Henry.

163
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,018
Yeah, I think you're right.
She seems a little off.

164
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,358
What, did I kiss you wrong? Or...

165
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,861
No, no, I'm just tired.

166
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,531
And this place is a mess.
And Sherry just said to my face...

167
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,244
- basically, that I'm a mess.
- She's an idiot. Just lie down.

168
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,830
I'll take care of this, take care of him.

169
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,791
Shh.

170
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,128
<i>And there he goes.
Every time I touch him.</i>

171
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,922
Just fucking let me do it, Joe. Joe. Joe.

172
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,007
It's fine.

173
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,594
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

174
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,889
Hey, hey, hey.

175
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,016
<i>Why does my own child not like me?</i>

176
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,436
You know, babies can tell
when your heart's not in it.

177
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,731
- I... What...?
- No. I'm sorry. It's all in my head.

178
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,283
Go fuck yourself.

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,502
<i>Love's right.
My heart's not really in it.</i>

180
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,964
<i>How could it be when you stole it?</i>

181
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Love?

182
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,928
Hey, uh...

183
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,683
we're running low on diapers,
so I'll be right back.

184
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,820
<i>Honestly, you're what's gotten me
through this imprisonment.</i>

185
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,492
<i>The green light at the end of my dock.</i>

186
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Knowing you feel the same as I do.</i>

187
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,875
Hello, neighbor.

188
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,428
<i>I don't want it
to happen here like this.</i>

189
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,264
<i>I want you some place luxurious.
You deserve that.</i>

190
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,392
The car is fine. Shut up and kiss me.

191
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,018
Did you just read my mind?

192
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,617
- Hey, neighbor.
- Hi, Natalie.

193
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,455
You must be so under-slept.
I hear your baby crying all the time.

194
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,332
- Oh.
- No, no. Babies cry. Just...

195
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,086
I get why you might be sleeping
in a grocery store parking lot.

196
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,964
Here. I thought I'd save you a trip.

197
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,883
<i>You've been watching me too.</i>

198
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,218
- Thank you.
- One more thing.

199
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,847
Don't believe the bullshit
about breastfeeding preventing pregnancy.

200
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,141
My sister got knocked up so fast.

201
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,393
Friends tell friends. So...

202
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,273
<i>Are you flirting with me?</i>

203
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,533
<i>Sure, the condom thing may be
a little joke from a neighbor</i>

204
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>with a mild taste for stirring the pot.</i>

205
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,414
<i>Just friendly. Very friendly though.</i>

206
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,584
<i>Exciting as that is, I have to be careful.</i>

207
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:18,339
<i>I can't just walk out of this web.
The spider has my child.</i>

208
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,217
<i>Also, truth? I've made...</i>

209
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,887
<i>mistakes in the past.</i>

210
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>Would you be a mistake?</i>

211
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,438
<i>Who are you?</i>

212
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,194
- Where are you going? Great, feed Henry.
- Oh, just...

213
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,447
I got winded going up ten stairs.
I need to hit a gym.

214
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,198
<i>Shit.</i>

215
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,789
<i>Whenever I hang with Henry,
I'm reminded of two things.</i>

216
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,374
<i>One, he hates me.</i>

217
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,378
<i>Two, I have to protect him at all costs
from what happened to me.</i>

218
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>Joey!</i>

219
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,841
- Where's your mama now?
- Run, you little bitch!

220
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,260
- Run, you little bitch!
- Come get some.

221
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,011
- What are you scared of?
- Get him!

222
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,680
Come on, Joey!

223
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,973
Open the door.

224
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,183
- You freak!
- Come get what's coming to you.

225
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,936
- Boys! What's going on here?
- Teacher! Run!

226
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,146
Boys! What did...?

227
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,115
Hey, hey. Joe, Joe. Let me in.
Hey, it's me, it's me. Let me in.

228
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,994
Dude, you okay?

229
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,122
Bro, why do you do this to yourself?

230
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,291
- They're the ones who do it.
- You asked for it.

231
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,296
- Quit saying your mom's coming back.
- She is.

232
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,173
If she cared, would you be here?

233
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,301
- You don't understand.
- Fine.

234
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,678
Just shut up about it, okay?

235
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,991
- I don't see why...
- The rest of us are trying to deal

236
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,975
with how no one fucking wants us.

237
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,647
Face it. When our parents gave us up,
they threw us away forever, man.

238
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,695
Natalie!
Oh, my God, look at this place!

239
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,778
<i>Who are you?</i>

240
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,784
<i>On the surface, a realtor,
and you're good at it.</i>

241
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
<i>You wanna make things lovelier.</i>

242
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,206
<i>You left college early
when you met your husband,</i>

243
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,751
<i>tech entrepreneur Matthew Engler,</i>

244
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,295
<i>about whom there is even less to learn</i>

245
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,923
<i>unless I wanna take the word of publicists</i>

246
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,342
<i>paid to manicure every inch

247
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,511
<i>Is this what you wanted?</i>

248
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,557
<i>Marry someone older, busy, never home</i>

249
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,976
<i>while you sell houses to rich assholes</i>

250
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,022
<i>and pick up his dry cleaning?
Is that love for you?</i>

251
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,815
<i>Do you love him?</i>

252
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,319
<i>Do you long for something deeper, true?</i>

253
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,112
<i>Like I do.</i>

254
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,426
- I know.
- I think someone...

255
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,453
- Like, I think maybe...
- Oh, Love Quinn!

256
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,455
Come hither.

257
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,875
- Hi.
- Hi. This is Kiki, and this is Andrew.

258
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,339
Love's gorgeous baby boy is,
what, seven months?

260
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,091
- Yeah.
- Oh, I miss that age.

261
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,178
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love, I was glad to see you in class.

262
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,722
- Fucking kicked my ass.
- Oh, I know.

263
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
That class is for really fit people,

264
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,977
but you'll get used to it.

265
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,356
- I had so much baby weight to lose.
- Same. I had quite the journey.

266
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,817
I mean, much worse than yours.

267
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,527
It was. It really was.

268
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,823
Is it just me
or is everyone calling me fat?

269
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,200
- Oh, oh, no.
- No, no, no.

270
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,619
And would that even be a pejorative?

271
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,664
I mean, beauty doesn't have a size, Love.

272
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,125
Come latte with us.

273
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,002
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

274
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,170
Okay.

275
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,173
- Yeah, I could go for some coffee.
- Amazing.

276
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,134
Great! We got a group.

277
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,894
<i>I might not have solved
the mystery of you yet,</i>

278
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,274
<i>but I know one thing:
I wasn't wrong to be intrigued.</i>

279
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,612
<i>Forgive the pun.
This speaks volumes about you.</i>

280
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,782
<i>I didn't even know
this hell-burb had a library.</i>

281
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,127
<i>Libraries represent
the very best of civilized society,</i>

282
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,256
<i>the housing of an egalitarian access
to knowledge.</i>

283
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
<i>It's what separates us from the apes.</i>

284
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,807
<i>And yet, it physically hurts to see
the condition of most of these books.</i>

285
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,810
<i>Mr. Mooney once said
the way a society treats its books</i>

286
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,574
<i>is the most accurate harbinger
of its fate.</i>

287
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>You see enough broken bindings,</i>

288
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,692
<i>you know that Rome's burning
or will be soon enough.</i>

289
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>But there's still something to fight for
in this wretched world.</i>

290
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, what's little man's name?

291
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,621
- Oh, it's Henry.
- I dated a Henry.

292
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,249
- Henrys are great.
- Well, Henry thanks you.

293
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,501
Excuse us.

294
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,836
<i>Hard to be invisible

The Fifth Season, Gone Girl, Seabiscuit.

297
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,392
<i>Okay, I'm stumped. Why those?</i>

298
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,019
<i>Who are you?</i>

299
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,063
Oh, Henry, okay.

300
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,201
All right, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

301
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,376
- Hi.
- So are you gonna chase after her,

302
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,003
- or could I help you with something?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,966
- I'd like to apply for a library card.
- You've come to the right place.

304
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,175
Good.

305
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,636
Fill that out for me.

306
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,807
We have a great kids section
just in the corner.

307
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,727
And... you can take that home with you.

308
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,231
Natalie picked it out for you.

309
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,737
<i>You are flirting with me.</i>

310
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,322
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

311
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,956
When they start to crawl,
it's a miracle anyone survives.

312
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm so blessed
we have three incredible nannies.

313
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,504
Oh, my God.
It's twice as insane with twins.

314
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,923
It's kind of why I started writing.
To just share.

315
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,802
So others won't make
the mountain of mistakes I did.

316
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,263
Yeah. What is the name of your blog again?

317
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,432
Oh, she's <i>Heart-Shaped Mistakes.</i>

318
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,726
- You seriously haven't read it?
- No.

319
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,228
- It's small.
- She invented momfluencing.

320
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
- Don't be humble.
- No. It's fun.

321
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,817
I can stay home with my twins.
What do you do for work?

322
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:01,366
- Well, I used to... I'm trained as a chef.
- Oh.

323
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah, and I, uh...

324
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,664
I haven't really had much time
since he was born, I guess.

325
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,459
- Well, yes.
- Your job right now is to connect

326
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,960
with your baby and your man.

327
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,714
So easy for you to say.
Has your vagina even recovered yet?

328
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,426
- Oh, my God. You're embarrassing her.
- Don't be vagina-phobic.

329
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:25,098
God! I wish someone would've told me.
Sex is hard to get back into.

330
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,353
- But connecting intimately? So crucial.
- Mm-hm.

331
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,814
Endorphins, oxytocin,
it's incredible for the breast milk.

332
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,609
In fact, if you're not orgasming,

333
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,238
your breast milk isn't doing it
for your baby's precious growing brain.

334
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,158
- Well, we're all over that, so...
- Oh.

335
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,242
Okay.

336
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,501
Tender Is the Night<i> is widely
considered Fitzgerald's darkest work.</i>

337
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,670
<i>It's about marriage and infidelity.</i>

338
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,089
<i>Invitation? Or a warning?</i>

339
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,591
- Okay. I finally got him down.
- Mm. Good work.

340
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,512
And I got you...

341
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,765
a <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

342
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>Don't get me wrong.
This isn't some German fairy tale</i>

343
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,772
<i>where a witch keeps me locked up
till it's time to eat me.</i>

344
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,692
<i>Love is nice, giving.</i>

345
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>I fell in love
with a certain version of her.</i>

346
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,574
What do you think?

347
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,916
- It's okay.
- Exactly. This is the best bakery in town?

348
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,585
Shoddy lamination. Too sweet.

349
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,839
- Definitely didn't use French butter.
- Yeah. Yeah, banish them.

350
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,174
Off with their heads. Done.

351
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,022
- Hi.
- Hi.

352
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,075
Am I interrupting your reading?

353
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,162
- No, no. No, you're not.
- Seems like I am.

354
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
- Just come back. Come back, Love.
- Fuck.

355
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,832
- Stay. Stay.
- No, Joe. Why?

356
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,254
- Why won't you talk to me?
- What? We talk...

357
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,673
Something is going on.
You're always distracted.

358
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,800
- I'm not distracted.
- Why won't you tell me?

359
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,930
I've got him.

360
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,271
I'm gonna take him to his grandma's.

361
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,565
- Love.
- No, don't worry about it, Joe.

362
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,609
Enjoy the quiet.

363
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,294
<i>Where are you?</i>

364
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,685
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, neighbor.</i>

365
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,187
<i>Care for a drink?</i>

366
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,816
How'd you get my number?

367
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,443
My husband, Matthew, works in tech.

368
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,612
So...

369
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,699
not at all invasive tech.

370
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,202
Why are you nervous?

371
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,663
Got some checkered past
you're trying to hide?

372
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,542
No, I'm not worried about me so much as...

373
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,879
you know, the future of civilization.

374
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,422
Ah.

375
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,217
Well, that's a lost cause.

376
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,304
You know, I feel I should warn you.

377
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,016
There's no such thing
as privacy in Madre Linda.

378
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
Including here.

379
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,686
See.

380
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,731
All the cameras in my house.

381
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,653
One out here is broken. That's why
I spend so much time by the pool.

382
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,950
It's the only place in this entire town
I don't feel like I'm being watched.

383
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,202
Boop. Boop.

384
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,371
There.

385
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,914
<i>You want us to be alone?</i>

386
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,583
Even that's not really privacy.

387
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,043
Matthew will see I turned them off
and wonder why.

388
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,339
It's so weird,
I don't remember putting on a leash,

389
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,424
just kind of...

390
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,302
slipped around my neck at some point.

391
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,429
<i>You're a prisoner too.</i>

392
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,599
I guess
marriage isn't really built for secrets.

393
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,185
Or people aren't really built
for marriage.

394
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,313
Come with.

395
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,232
I need another drink.

396
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,371
To new friends.

397
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,585
"Who can often have
a better time together than old."

398
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,629
- You got my book.
- Hmm.

399
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,006
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

400
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,801
Here. Is that okay? Can I see it?

401
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,225
Aye. Just put pressure on it.
That should stop the bleeding.

402
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,689
Do you have a first aid kit?

403
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,524
Yeah.

404
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,028
<i>It feels right.</i>

405
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,655
<i>Taking care of you.</i>

406
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,367
There. I think you'll live.

407
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,037
- Does it hurt?
- Nothing more wine won't cure.

408
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,716
<i>You feel it too, don't you?</i>

409
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,801
What?

410
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,222
That feeling
when you're first with someone.

411
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,267
All the tension, possibility...

412
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,018
I wish I could bottle it.

413
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,188
It's better than anything.

414
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,272
<i>I feel it.</i>

415
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,153
I thought it would stay, with Matthew.

416
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,575
Do you think it inevitably goes away?

417
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,076
I think if it's right...

418
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,204
it stays.

419
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,250
So how long did it stay with you and Love?

420
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,296
It's hard to say. Um...

421
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,631
I didn't know the real her...

422
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,342
when I fell in love.

423
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,511
- I know how that feels.
- I got swept up.

424
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,430
By the time I realized, it was too late.

425
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,768
I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave her.

426
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,771
People leave all the time.

427
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,152
Not Love.

428
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,197
Our daughter... We thought
we were gonna have a little girl.

429
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,407
Anyway...

430
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,993
I'm in it now...

431
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,994
with Love.

432
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,537
Are you?

433
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,418
Kids aren't handcuffs.

434
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,504
Matthew has a stepson.

435
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,176
- We don't see him much.
- That sounds terrible, for the kid.

436
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,927
It's fine, actually.

437
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,054
You know why?

438
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,806
People are happier
when they aren't lying to themselves...

439
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,225
and everyone else.

440
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,977
So, what are you doing here?

441
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,525
- I can't leave him either.
- Oh!

442
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,404
I can't do that to him.

443
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,241
Even if it means I stay in this...

444
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,580
<i>Dwell Magazine, Twilight Zone</i>
fucking purgatory forever.

445
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,458
- Is it that bad here?
- Ha.

446
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,710
If you're not careful,

447
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,923
you'll start caring about private schools,

448
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,884
stock portfolios,
start reading on a Kindle.

449
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,802
Fuck.

450
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,187
You wanna see my reading room?

451
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,446
We've always slept in separate rooms.

452
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,281
I'm an insomniac.

453
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,159

00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,930
<i>No, never again.</i>

466
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,225
<i>I promised myself I would do this right.</i>

467
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,644
Love. Hey, I thought...

468
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,396
I got there...

469
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,941
and then I thought about seeing my mom,

470
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,819
and I went and got Häagen-Dazs instead.

471
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,324
Are you okay? You look a little flushed.

472
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,285
I just had a drink with the neighbor.

473
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,245
- Hmm.
- You're right. She's crazy.

474
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,832
Look, I'm sorry for running off.

475
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,917
I just...

476
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,469
I was just thinking about our vows.

477
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,555
Oh. Yeah.

478
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,559
The ones we wrote on In-N-Out bags
on the way to the courthouse.

479
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,147
You said you would always share a bite
of your pastry with me.

480
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,817
That's... That's so generous.

481
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,612
- I am generous.
- You really are, and I'm an asshole.

482
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,324
- No, you're not. You're just...
- I am. And it's been so crazy.

483
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,328
And I was just thinking about that bite.

484
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,624
And you were hungry?

485
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,169
- Yeah.
- Me too.

486
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,055
<i>That feeling you wanna bottle,</i>

487
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,391
<i>turns out, it can come back.</i>

488
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,911
<i>Maybe this is what we were looking for
in each other, Natalie.</i>

489
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,520
<i>What I needed from you.</i>

490
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,189
<i>A way back to Love.</i>

491
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,567
<i>Maybe, thanks to you,</i>

492
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,318
<i>I can make this work.</i>

493
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,377
I should have told Sherry we were busy.
This is gonna suck.

494
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,921
Something tells me
she's not someone you say no to.

495
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,714
It'll be fine.

496
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,884
I have you...

497
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,011
and pie.

498
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,180
- Quinn-Goldbergs.
- Hey.

499
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,434
- Step right on up.
- Here you go. This is for you.

500
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
- It's gluten-free.
- Oh, great.

501
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,311
Yes.

502
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
<i>Fun fact,
Sherry had to post an apology video</i>

503
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,275
<i>in August 2020 after it was discovered</i>

504
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>that she had a massive party
while the rest of us were home,</i>

505
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,988
<i>clutching hand sanitizer.</i>

506
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,116
<i>Rumor was, the whole neighborhood got
a secret vaccine</i>

507
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,494
<i>manufactured for the Queen of England
and were thus immune to COVID.</i>

508
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,080
<i>I don't believe in conspiracies,</i>

509
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,375
<i>except when they're about
unfair advantages of being rich.</i>

510
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,170
<i>Those are true.
Trust me, I married a Quinn.</i>

511
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,840
Go get you some Pinot.
It's from my friends' winery.

512
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,343
They 3D-print their wine barrels.

513
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,761
Hi.

514
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,935
Thank you.

515
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh, that's Kiki and her husband, Brandon.

516
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,401
And there's Andrew and his lawyer husband.

517
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,028
I can't remember his name.

518
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,529
Jackson.

519
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,954
Andrew, Jackson. Now, that is unfortunate.

520
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,789
Oh, my God.

521
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,834
- How could I forget?
- They seem okay,

522
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,545
if you discount the obscene
one-percenter bubble they live in.

523
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,758
Mm. I have to discount that
or we'd have to guillotine both of us too.

524
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,593
Then they're a nice couple.

525
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,306
Contrary to our gracious host.

526
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,016
<i>Never trust a queen bee.</i>

527
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,143
Let me show you around, Love.

528
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,853
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

529
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,189
Ah, you must be Joe.

530
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,942
Finally, we meet. Cary Conrad.

531
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:11,406
'Cause is your life even a brand
without a perfectly imperfect soulmate?

532
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,699
Oh, my God.

533
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,661
Mission accomplished. I cannot tell
who the bigger douchebag is.

534
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,747
- Nice to meet you.
- Let me show you the grill setup.

535
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,332
Okay.

536
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,213
<i>A sea of awkward nerds made good.
Tech made the money, wives did the rest.</i>

537
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,840
<i>Clothes, hair, Barry's Bootcamp,</i>

538
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:33,386
<i>and they go from kid-stuffed-in-locker
to 21st-century master of the universe.</i>

539
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,264
<i>- It's kind of sweet.</i>
- Kiki tells Dakota, "Don't bother Daddy.

540
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,517
He's micro-dosing ketamine.
It's his special time."

541
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,978
<i>If you overlook the haze
of narcissistic delusion</i>

542
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,271
<i>that just the right biohack,</i>

543
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,564
<i>you'll live forever.</i>

544
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,942
It's all paleo. Well, keto, really.

545
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,362
I find when I I.F.,
I'm good on any amount of fats.

546
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,406
- I.F.?
- Intermittent fasting.

547
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,365
You don't?

548
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:00,580
Well, I mean, obviously you must not
because you're genetically blessed.

549
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,915
Let me get in there.

550
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,666
Oh, yeah.

551
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,753
Lucky. Super high metab.

552
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,882
The guys come and train with me.
I'm a monster. You'll love it.

553
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,302
<i>Is he flirting with me
or inviting me to join Fight Club?</i>

554
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,845
Help yourself to meat.

555
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,055
I'll be back.

556
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,227
I didn't know
Lena and Chris were back from Paris.

557
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,981
Oh, and apparently had the best time.

558
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,233
- They're open, the marriage.
- Oh.

559
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,195
No judgment from me.

560
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,987
Really?

561
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,741
- None?
- I spent my summers growing up

562
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,952
on a commune,
so I got a big dose of all that.

563
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,746
Whatever works, right?

564
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,541
You are such a breath of fresh air, Love.

565
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,043
I'm glad you moved here.

566
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,339
- My pleasure.
- Oh.

567
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,465
Hi.

568
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,634
Natalie and Matthew Engler.

569
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,137
- Oh, she looks amazing.
- She is a bad person.

570
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,101
Matthew was married
to this incredible woman named Mimi,

571
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,104
mother of his child, and then, well...

572
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,688
He met Natalie, and...

573
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,400
We're far too feminist
to ever say a woman stole a man.

574
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,655
She's nice enough.
Great realtor, you know. A cheater.

575
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,907
Good to know
when a person lives next door.

576
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,825
Mm-hm.

577
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,578
Oh, I must say hello to Les.
He's sourcing us a French bulldog.

578
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,705
- I'm empty. I'm gonna go fill up.
- Okay.

579
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,380
<i>You're here, with him?</i>

580
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,257
<i>Looking perfectly content.</i>

581
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,094
<i>Was our evening nothing?
A mistake for us both?</i>

582
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,432
Ever sat in a virtual reality pod?

583
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,977
- Joe?
- No, I can't say that I have.

584
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,313
Oh, Cary's got one in his garage.
It's insane.

585
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,151
Not even just for porn.
But also the porn is spectacular.

586
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,696
<i>We as a species
deserve to go extinct.</i>

587
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,827
So my friend Rachel in L.A.,

588
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,790
she said the brother's a crackhead
who got himself killed.

589
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,460
And the dad's shady too.
Apparently, Anavrin is a front.

590
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,754
Money just papers over that garbage fire.

591
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,050
And, of course, she took her daddy's cash,
bought a whole new life here,

592
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,845
where the rest of us work
for what we have.

593
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,430
- Amen.
- Amen.

594
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,513
Hi.

595
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,808
Can I top off your wine?

596
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,561
- Hi.
- Oh, my God!

597
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,644
Okay.

598
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,069
May I state the obvious?
Sherry Conrad is a terrible person.

599
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,033
- Can you fucking believe that?
- Who runs this town, so...

600
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,828
you kind of can't
get righteously indignant

601
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,748
unless you also wanna be lonely.

602
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,501
Well, I have friends.

603
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,587
Where, in L.A.?

604
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,924
You need some here too.

605
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,010
I assume you came here for the schools?

606
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,013
Well, now, you know those come at a cost.

607
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,848
Pinot, please.

608
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,769
Look, they hate me.

609
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,232
Think I stole Matthew from their friend,
who by the way, was cheating first, but...

610
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,901
Point is,

611
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,904
everyone has to find their way
in Madre Linda.

612
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,325
You mean, around Sherry and her mafia?

613
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,495
It'll be easier
if you can get them to accept you.

614
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,415
They just called my family a garbage fire.
I don't really see that happening.

615
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,625
Okay. Fair.

616
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,672
So do what I do. Get her to respect you.

617
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,424
Authenticity scares the shit out of her.

618
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,096
Do you, no apology, loud and proud,
and you'll cow her into,

619
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,141
if not submission,
at least basic fake friendship.

620
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,313
Okay, great. One problem.
I don't really know who I am these days.

621
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,778
I just had a baby,

622
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,863
and everything's a...

623
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,159
There's nothing authentic
or intimidating about me.

624
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,829
I'm just a stay-at-home mom going insane.

625
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,167
I guess there's some...

626
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,045
things I need to figure out.

627
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,506
So if you could do anything,

628
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,800
what would you do?

629
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,883
Just for fun?

630
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,344
Okay.

631
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,848
So this is stupid.

632
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,060
But I have this fantasy
of opening a bakery.

633
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,105
I'm a trained pastry chef in another life,

634
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,525
and feels ridiculous to think about
in a town where nobody eats gluten.

635
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,651
I eat gluten.

636
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,736
Seriously?

637
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,446
You know what?

638
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,908
There's a space available
that might be perfect.

639
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,452
Could be wrong.

640
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,246
Or this was fate.

641
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,373
Call me if you ever wanna see it.

642
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,792
Thank you.

643
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,381
It's really nice
to have an actual conversation.

644
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,925
I can't believe
we've been living next door for months.

645
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,511
Joe's seen more of you than I have.

646
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,055
Oh, not really.

647
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,642
I keep telling Matthew, I'd love to have
you both over for a drink sometime.

648
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,937
It's crazy, we haven't had
either of you at the house yet.

649
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,314
We'll do it soon.

650
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,234
Yeah, that sounds great.

651
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,486
Definitely.

652
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,155
<i>What is wrong?</i>

653
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,366
I have been doing everything
for this family,

654
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,242
and you've been fucking the neighbor.

655
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,288
- What? Wait, what are you talking about?
- I'm not an idiot, Joe!

656
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,664
I'm not having an...

657
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,210
Look, I don't know what she said,
but I told you the truth.

658
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,421
We had a drink.
She started acting a little crazy. I left.

659
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,841
Then you came home and fucked me
for the first time in six months.

660
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,405
- What is that? A coincidence?
- Fine. I like that she flirted.

661
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,739
Is that what we're doing now?
Policing each other's minds?

662
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,391
- Are we not allowed to have a fantasy?
- Don't give me that.

663
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,519
There's nothing simple about it
when somebody gets stuck in your mind.

664
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,747
- I don't care if you fucked her.
- Sounds like you care.

665
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,022
Are you obsessed with her?

666
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,317
- It's not like that.
- Really?

667
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,111
- Yeah.
- You sure?

668
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,656
I'm sure. Because it was like that
with you, Love! I married you.

669
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,419
The man I fell in love with would do
anything for the ones he loves.

670
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,744
I still would. I moved here.

671
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,123
We're in this fake, plastic suburban hell.

672
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:21,544
- We moved here for the baby.
- He was supposed to be a girl.

673
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,755
What does that fucking matter?

674
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,383
I don't even... I... I don't... It doesn't.

675
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,136
It feels so emblematic
of getting it wrong,

676
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,514
of feeling like I am gonna
fuck him up. Like he knows.

677
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
He looks at me like I'm a monster.

678
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,352
How do you think I feel?

679
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,731
You remember what Forty said.
Five seconds before he died.

680
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,445
That I'd be crazy if I ever thought
I could be a good mother.

681
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,656
Well, he was out of his mind.

682
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,577
Maybe he wasn't.

683
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,331
We...

684
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,126
both...

685
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,838
have done bad things.

686
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,634
I wanted to move here so that...

687
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,137
we could start new...

688
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,808
be safe and never have
to do anything bad ever again.

689
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,519
We get to choose.

690
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,605
We get to choose. We are safe now.

691
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,189
We're together.

692
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,108
I promise, no more.

693
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,946
No more bad things ever again, okay?

694
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,658
While we're telling the truth,

695
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,119
you are a great mother.

696
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,746
Thanks.

697
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,297
Does that mean
I can stop reading Sherry's shitty blog?

698
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,263
There's still time to bond with him.

699
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,477
Try reading him something
other than Fitzgerald. He is a baby.

700
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,981
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

701
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,904
Should we go home?

702
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,323
Yeah, let's go home.

703
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,547
- Hey, are we okay?
- Hey.

704
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,507
- He's been great all night.
- Okay.

705
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,927
Go get some rest. I got him.
Really. I got him. I got him.

706
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,637
- Thank you, thank you.
- Good night.

707
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,406
- Thank you, thank you.
- I love you, Forty.

708
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,431
Oh.

709
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,517
You're okay, Henry.

710
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,438
<i>"Happily ever after" looks
a lot different than I thought.</i>

711
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,488
<i>And a family, the reality of one,</i>

712
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,240
<i>might not be for everyone...</i>

713
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,494
<i>but it's all I've ever wanted.</i>

714
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,832
<i>So I'm gonna make this work.
No matter what it takes.</i>

715
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,171
<i>Goodbye, you.</i>

716
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,271
Nineteen bucks? It's crazy.
I'll give you 2 bucks.

717
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,275
This isn't a pawnshop, sir.
We don't negotiate late fees.

718
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,153
Manager. I wanna speak to a manager.

719
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,346
Hi, Natalie.

720
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,097
Yep.

721
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,770
Yeah, I wanted to see that place
you were talking about for a bakery.

722
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,482
Amazing.

723
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,738
"But he could not think
of a story to tell Frog.

724
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,448
Then...

725
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,532
Uh...

726
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,703
Toad poured a glass of water
over his head."

727
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,960
Am I the asshole here?
I'm sorry. That's a bad word.

728
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,588
Is it me?

729
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,550
I'm trying.

730
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,346
I'm in over my head.

731
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,933
He said, using an idiom
his son will never understand

732
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,435
because it's impossible
to communicate with babies.

733
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,897
Yeah, right. Exactly.

734
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,325
How are we supposed
to understand each other?

735
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,162
How am I supposed to do this right?

736
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,125
I wanna do this right, Forty...

737
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,835
Henry. Henry.

738
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:13,919
Henry, you see?

739
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,755
You're getting into my head.

740
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm gonna do everything I can.

741
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,101
I just don't know what that means yet.

742
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,727
I...

743
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,782
So wait, you don't hate me?

744
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,749
Yeah, same here.

745
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,625
Same here.

746
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,919
Okay. Yeah, it's a good talk.

747
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,131
Yeah, let's keep reading.

748
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,174
Uh...

749
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,136
"'Why are you pouring water
over your head?' asked Frog.

750
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:10,309
'I hope that if I pour water over my head,
it will help me to think of a story.'"

751
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,610
It's cute, right?

752
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,154
Build-out's already mostly done for you.

753
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,952
And the tenant left all the appliances?

754
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,121
Kind of had to.

755
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,290
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

756
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,043
This town isn't exactly
the easiest market.

757
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,086
Your stuff has to be good.

758
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,548
- That, I'm not worried about.
- Then nothing to worry about.

759
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,718
Except landlord has another offer.

760
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:51,016
But he loves me, so sign
a 3-year lease today and you're golden.

761
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,062
I already sent you papers to e-sign.

762
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,069
- Can I...? Can I see downstairs?
- Yeah, let's go.

763
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,268
Okay, so I know how it looks,

764
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,145
but I was told this is
the best walk-in freezer on the market.

765
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,816
Let me show you the other storage room.

766
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,915
Permits are easy.

767
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,085
So you can have
this place up and running crazy fast.

768
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:47,883
Bottom line, in the right hands,
this place could be a raging success.

769
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,469
So, what do you think?

770
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,642
This is just the beginning, Henry.

771
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,645
<i>Frog and Toad </i>are great. But wait
until you meet <i>Pippi Longstocking.</i>

772
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,331
You'll freak out.

773
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,148
I'm just leaving the library. What's up?

774
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,946
Hey, Love. You okay?

775
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,491
Um, Joe.

776
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,868
What's wrong?

777
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,412
I think we need to go to couples' therapy.
