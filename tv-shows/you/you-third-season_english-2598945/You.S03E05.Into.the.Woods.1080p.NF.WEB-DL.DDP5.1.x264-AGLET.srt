1
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>Previously on</i> You:

2
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,105
I have a plan.

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,025
<i>Mrs. Engler was involved
in an extramarital relationship</i>

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,318
<i>with Gil Brigham.</i>

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>In a written letter, Mr. Brigham confessed</i>

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,383
<i>that he murdered Mrs. Engler
and disposed of her remains.</i>

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,567
Find the people that get you.

8
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,161
- How do you know who those people are?
- You just do.

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>I can't be thinking
about you like this. No.</i>

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,167
You okay there, Joe?

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>Oh, no. This is bad.</i>

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,717
We've really turned a corner.
We barely fight anymore.

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,722
And when we disagree,
we discuss it directly, then we move on.

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,098
Guess you could say we're just

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,893
- a normal, boring suburban family.
- Whoo!

16
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,176
<i>She said boring. Not me.</i>

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,395
Everything's fine.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,439
<i>Sure, little bit of a yawn.</i>

19
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,985
Oh, it's been six months.

20
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,783
- And we don't know how to say this.
<i>- Come on, Love. Spit it out.</i>

21
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,409
Do we need to keep coming?

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,205
I know we're already down
to every other week,

23
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,791
but we rarely have anything
to talk about with you.

24
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,125
<i>Or with each other.</i>

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,418
Is this financial?

26
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,589
We talked about your mom buying
the vineyard and you feeling strapped.

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,300
- No, business is good.
- Love is being modest.

28
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,719
The bakery is a huge success.

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,640
I can't believe I'm so happy here.

30
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,434
<i>I'd never call Love a pod person,</i>

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>but let's just say she's assimilated.</i>

32
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,482
- Joe? How have you been?
<i>- Oh, I'm fine.</i>

33
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>Bored, trapped in Pleasantville,
aging so fast,</i>

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,654
<i>I forget to jack off in the shower.</i>

35
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,737
I'm good.

36
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
Work is good.

37
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,995
- Uh, I've really gotten into lawn care.
- Oh, my God.

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,708
- He is obsessed with the lawn.
- The lawn is the foyer to the home.

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,588
<i>My love of our glorious foyer is genuine.</i>

40
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>After Gil, I realized there's a price
to pay if you want a stable life.</i>

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>And I am happy</i>

42
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,684
<i>to forego excitement and chaos for that,
to be the husband and father I want to be.</i>

43
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,897
<i>I can do it, for Henry. I'm great at it.
Lawn mowers are very fun.</i>

44
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,317
Joe's been having
a harder time making friends here.

45
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,527
<i>Excuse me?</i>

46
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,656
I have plenty of friends.
I do, at the library.

47
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,827
- Any friends you don't work with?
<i>- Well, no.</i>

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>Everyone else is an asshole.</i>

49
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,497
Let me tell you what Love is not saying.

50
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,126
Not having friends puts
a lot of pressure on a partner.

51
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,671
- Do you feel pressure, Love?
- Yes.

52
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>She does?</i>

53
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,633
One person cannot fulfill all our needs.

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,095
It's crucial to have friends
outside a marriage.

55
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,347
It takes some of that pressure off.

56
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,476
<i>I don't see great candidates
for BFF here in Madre Linda, but...</i>

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Okay.

58
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,480
I will try harder.

59
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,692
<i>I'm annoyed, but promises are easy
when your priorities are clear.</i>

60
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>Make our marriage work.</i>

61
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,780
So our time's almost up, but I should ask.

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,241
How's your sex life been?

63
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,701
- It's good.
- It's great.

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,871
It's great. I should have said great.

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,253
Wait.

66
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>Ah. Not again.</i>

67
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,381
Hold on, I just...

68
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,926
- I need a sec.
- Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,096
I'm tired anyway.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,195
Remember what we used to say? I wolf you.

71
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,324
Yeah.

72
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,536
We should bring that back.

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>We also never rip each other's clothes off</i>

74
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,540
<i>and fuck like wildcats anymore.</i>

75
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>We've been domesticated.</i>

76
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
- I'm sorry about...
- No, it's fine.

77
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,633
I wolf you.

78
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,100
<i>Wolf? We're dog-on-a-leash now.</i>

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,310
<i>This is fine. It's normal.</i>

80
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,270
<i>It's fine.</i>

81
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,564
<i>And if it feels like it's not,
maybe I'm the problem.</i>

82
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,784
<i>Maybe you and Dr. Chandra are right.</i>

83
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,371
<i>My introvert tendencies are
the reason I feel off.</i>

84
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,916
Joe, mm, can you tilt your chin forward?

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,836
<i>But did you have
to make Sherry your best friend?</i>

86
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,045
Oh, my God.

87
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,674
The camera is loving Henry's authenticity.

88
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,846
Um... Guys, are we sure
puppies is the right theme for the party?

89
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm not usually indecisive. It's just...

90
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,309
Sherry keeps saying that...

91
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>Parties indicate your child
and family are socially adjusted</i>

92
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,148
<i>and an integral part of the community.</i>

93
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,776
<i>And a critical part
of getting into The Ashman School,</i>

94
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>Madre Linda's premiere private Pre-K.</i>

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>- Shoot me.</i>
- We're doing everything right.

96
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,367
Joe, no one wants
to go to a birthday party

97
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,412
where Daddy looks
like a Cymbalta commercial, okay?

98
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,248
So, Love, let's get
some singles over here,

99
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,000
and, Joe, just shake it off.

100
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,294
Just shake it off.

101
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,795
Come on.

102
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,382
<i>Something about fitting
into suburbia has changed you, Love.</i>

103
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,094
<i>You went from being horrified
by the ostentatiousness of a kids party</i>

104
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,638
<i>- to Keeping Up With The Conrads.</i>
- The other side.

105
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,393
<i>And yet, you make belonging look
so effortless.</i>

106
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>- You do seem happy.</i>
- No Cymbalta here.

107
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>Why do I still feel
so on the outside?</i>

108
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,692
Joe, come over here, sweetie.
The vibe is much better.

109
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,281
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,825
I think Theo's visiting home.

111
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,367
Theo.

112
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,299
Yes! Yes!

113
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,467
Finally!

114
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,970
We got it.
These invitations are gonna be adorable.

115
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,555
Yeah.

116
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,560
- Thank you so much, Sherry. Really.
- Yeah.

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,854
Joe, I like it when you appreciate me.

118
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,902
If you could see his hair.

120
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,031
Mari, do me the favor of describing.

121
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,115
Oh, my.

122
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,157
Okay.

123
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:55,331
Whole vibe's very
Patrick-Bateman-meets-Venetian-gondolier.

124
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh, okay. Right. Let me just go fix it.

125
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,296
Oh, no, no. No. Wait, wait.

126
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,425
Dante, cover the floor?

127
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,178
Okay, here's one.

128
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:14,392
Favorite classic fantasy series.
Let's say 1970s through '90s?

129
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay. Give me a minute.

130
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,566
<i>Yes, I notice Marienne in that way,
but I cut it off instantly.</i>

131
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,276
<i>I'm married, so she and I are friends.</i>

132
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,838
<i>Am I supposed to feel bad
that I'm friends with people at work?</i>

133
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>Dragonriders of Pern,</i> maybe.

134
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,157
Okay.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,369
But, you know, as a kid, I hid them.
I was afraid they were for girls.

136
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,957
Why? It's dragons fighting space worms.
That is not gender-specific.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,711
- Trying to fit in is the worst.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

138
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,298
- How is this helping your portrait?
- Who said I was doing a portrait?

139
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,134
Well, I mean, I guess, sort of.

140
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,304
I had been working on this sketch
of the Little Prince and the Fox.

141
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,600
Couldn't get the Fox,
and your vibe today inspired me.

142
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,770
It's for this illustration contest
put on by this fancy imprint,

143
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,191
and this year, it's reinterpret
a classic of children's lit.

144
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,944
"It's the time you lavished on your rose

145
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,240
that makes your rose so important."

146
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,949
Hmm.

147
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,583
Um, anyway, I probably won't
even submit, so...

148
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,505
You have a habit of talking yourself out
of things. Is this something you do often?

149
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,008
All right, Sigmund Freud,
sit back and sit still, please.

150
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,595
I thought this wasn't a portrait.

151
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,850
- So why <i>The Little Prince?</i>
- Just always loved it.

152
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
Translations never do it justice,

153
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,606
but the original will always be
my favorite.

154
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,732
Do you speak French?

155
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,572
- My first language. I was born in Paris.
- You don't have an accent.

156
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,408
<i>You wanna be friends
with people who can surprise you.</i>

157
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,244
I moved when I was young,

158
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,998
and it's really just
not that interesting a story, so...

159
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,208
<i>Maybe to her.</i>

160
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>Why so wary?</i>

161
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,420
<i>So scared to be seen.</i>

162
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,385
<i>That's what I want in friends,
to be inspired to wonder.</i>

163
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,468
<i>Joe?</i>

164
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,263
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- Show me.

165
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,057
Your drawing.

166
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,157
It's going to be beautiful.

167
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,079
- Thank you.
- Marienne, you have to submit this.

168
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
<i>No, no, no.</i>

169
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,802
<i>Did I learn nothing from Natalie?
Why am I holding this?</i>

170
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,971
<i>Put the bracelet down.</i>

171
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,058
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

172
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,023
I mean, you look paler than usual,
and that's saying something.

173
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
No, everything's fine.

174
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,527
Okay.

175
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>Shit. Feeling drawn
to Marienne is just a symptom.</i>

176
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,577
<i>The problem is me, running away from
my perfectly good life and devoted wife.</i>

177
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,957
<i>So, if I'm the problem, how do I fix it?</i>

178
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,255
Smells good, bro.

179
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,179
But the key to truly orgasmic BBQ
is catching the meat yourself.

180
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,555
Yeah, you mentioned.

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,556
<i>Six times.</i>

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,476
<i>But it's okay because look at you.</i>

183
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,603
<i>Happy wife, happy life, right?</i>

184
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>What could say more about my commitment</i>

185
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,025
<i>than agreeing to dinner
with the fucking Conrads?</i>

186
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,653
<i>If putting up with Cro-Magnon man gets
the tips you need</i>

187
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,783
<i>to make Henry's party a success,
I'm all in because I am all in, damn it.</i>

188
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,871
- Are you sure you don't want a top off?
- Ugh. It won't kill me.

189
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,290
Ugh.

190
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,502
That one.

191
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:17,802
I heard he's on probation at school
for showing up to a midterm drunk.

192
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,928
- Oh.
- Thanks.

193
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
Imagine what his grades look like.

194
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,474
Actually, I thought he was doing okay.

195
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,602
That one's determined to self-destruct.

196
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,439
He got arrested in high school, two DUIs.

197
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,692
Just a matter of time before he starts
cooking meth like Jessica Sherman,

198
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,486
winds up dead in a ditch.

199
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,237
Mm.

200
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,158
I mean, he seems like a good kid
in a tough situation,

201
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,413
- but I know you know him better than I do.
- No.

202
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
No, you're right.

203
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,087
- He just needs some better influences.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,440
Pretty capable in the kitchen,
Miss Quinn-Goldberg.

205
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,217
Next time we'll be hunting
the pigs ourselves.

206
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,552
Is that right?

207
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,262
That'd be my husband.

208
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
Better watch out, Joe.

209
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,183
Cary's gonna wind up dragging you
on his hunting trip tomorrow,

210
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,685
make you a better man.

211
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,146
Actually, there's a spot
with your name all over it.

212
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,772
It's just what you need, my friend,

213
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,334
to recharge those masculine batteries,
if you know what I mean.

214
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,652
- <i>I do not.</i>
- We hike. We hunt.

215
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,948
We don't have to restrain
our, uh, natural impulses.

216
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,324
It's an incredible feeling,

217
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,077
letting out that part of yourself
that you have to cage.

218
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,414
<i>Unleashing my impulses
is the opposite of what I need to do.</i>

219
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,541
<i>No, thank you. Hard pass.</i>

220
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,669
It sounds great, but I do think
that we have Henry's party...

221
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,255
No, no, no. It sounds great.
You should totally go.

222
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,632
Sherry and my mom can help
with party prep.

223
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,552
Be great for you
to get to know the guys better.

224
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,554
<i>Saved by the bell.</i>

225
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,017
We're almost to the day.
My brother's September 2nd.

226
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,020
- Theo.
- Hi.

227
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,022
You look nice.

228
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,359
- What are...? What are you...?
- Oh, I, um...

229
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,280
It's street cleaning tomorrow,
so thought I'd give you a heads-up.

230
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,075
Car's in the driveway.

231
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,412
Yeah, but to warn you
not to put them on the street.

232
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,917
Okay.

233
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,003
- Okay, wait. Wait, wait, Theo.
- Yeah.

234
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,215
Are...? Are you okay?

235
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,634
Yep.

236
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,677
Never better.

237
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,098
Really? Because I heard that...

238
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
Hey.

239
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>Why do I feel like I walked
into the middle of something?</i>

240
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,568
Oh, by the way,
the lawn, it looks impeccable.

241
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,947
Richard Yates-level attention to detail.

242
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,907
<i>He's read Yates?</i>

243
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,787
- He's weirder than ever, huh?
- He's not weird.

244
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,207
He's a kid. Kids are weird.
Cut him some slack, okay?

245
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,254
<i>Why are you acting so...? No, no, no.</i>

246
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,299
<i>Stop looking for trouble.
You are fine. I am the problem.</i>

247
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,012
<i>So why do I feel
like you're hiding something?</i>

248
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,349
<i>Dr. Chandra would say
I'm falling into old patterns. No.</i>

249
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>I'm committed
to being a good husband and father.</i>

250
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,853
<i>That involves things like lawn care</i>

251
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,148
<i>and making sure there are
no fraudulent charges from hotels</i>

252
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,402
<i>where you're conducting an affair
with the stepson of the woman you killed.</i>

253
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,239
<i>Yeah, I know how crazy I sound...
Love! What the fuck?</i>

254
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,784
<i>One, two...
Twelve Uber charges in Palo Alto?</i>

255
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,620
<i>Are ride-shares
the seedy motels of NorCal?</i>

256
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,958
<i>How the fuck did I miss this?</i>

257
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,502
Hey. He's down.

258
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,049
What? Something wrong?

259
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,138
Do you know about
these Uber charges in Palo Alto?

260
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,350
Are you asking me or accusing me?

261
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,521
I'm calling the credit card company
to cancel. I just wanted to make sure.

262
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,358
Sometimes Theo texts me when he's drunk
and I get him an Uber.

263
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,152
What?

264
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,654
Nobody looks out for him, Joe.

265
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,616
And with Matthew,
it's good to keep a line open.

266
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,497
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

267
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,250
Love?

268
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,797
- Okay, he kissed me.
- He kissed you?

269
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:28,510
Yeah. It was before he left for school.
I mean, obviously, I shut it down.

270
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,429
- That's shutting it down?
- Don't yell.

271
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,057
- You've been sneaking around.
- That's crazy.

272
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,976
You made me feel
like something's wrong with me.

273
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,064
And I've done everything you asked.
You've been lying to me this whole time!

274
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,613
What the fuck was that, Joe?

275
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,116
You are clearly not happy.

276
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,621
I hope this weekend helps you get
your shit together. Something has to.

277
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,384
<i>Being with men
in the woods is not my thing,</i>

278
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,305
<i>but I couldn't say no to you
after what I did, so here I am.</i>

279
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,017
You can go on ahead without me if you...

280
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
Nah, no man left behind.

281
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:26,110
Cary and I made that pact at 'Manjaro.
He carried me up the Barranco Wall.

282
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,239
Kilimanjaro. What an amazing...
How much longer to the campsite?

283
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,075
Nothing bonds you like the altitude shits.

284
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,244
<i>Why is male small talk so terrible?</i>

285
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,705
'Manjaro was such an eye-opener.
When I got back,

286
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,790
Kiki and I started unschooling the kids.

287
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,958
Unschooling?

288
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,295
It advocates for child-chosen activities

289
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,548
instead of textbook-based learning.

290
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,008
Books can be the worst.

291
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,426
Mind-confiners, right?

292
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,221
Cary's the expert, even though
Sherry's all in on The Ashman School.

293
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,890
I respect how they make it work.

294
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,435
Can I tell you something?

295
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,313
Cary saved my marriage.

296
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,319
I made all this money in my 20s.
Didn't have to work, so I stayed home.

297
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,407
I loved being the kids' unteacher.
But, also, I was...

298
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,119
I just didn't feel like a man.

299
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,079
I was angry all the time.

300
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,291
I came here broken.

301
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,295
Cary helped me embrace my inner beast.

302
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,924
To grunt and breathe and scream and...

303
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,093
And cry.

304
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,305
To let go.

305
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,683
<i>All's fine and well for this guy,
his inner beast's a Persian kitten.</i>

306
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,727
Letting go is scary.

307
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,566
It's something about these woods,
with these men, that makes it feel safe.

308
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,612
I'm excited for you.
Your life's about to change.

309
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,199
<i>How coddled was his life
to believe he's safe among men?</i>

310
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,827
<i>I wasn't even safe among boys.</i>

311
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,957
You like that shit, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

312
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,711
Oh, this is so fun. This is so fun.

313
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,840
You're gonna cry for your mommy too, huh?
Just like your buddy Joe!

314
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,508
You okay?

315
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,350
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I'm in worse shape than I thought.

316
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,696
...if you hadn't been snacking
the whole time...

317
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,734
You know what?

318
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,158
Welcome to the Promised Land!

319
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,662
- You went all out.
- His minions went all out.

320
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,955
Got here hours ago.

321
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,666
It started off as a hike
and ended as a run.

322
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,794
Way too much energy. Yes!

323
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,212
Claim your digs.

324
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,132
Then we'll gather more wood.
I'm glad you're here, boys.

325
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,757
Let's go.

326
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,554
Faith over fear. It's time to check out,
so we can check in.

327
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,432
Let's hydrate! We're gonna do
some sweating, boys.

328
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,312
Mm-mm.

329
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,693
Rule number two. Only food we eat
is what we kill ourselves.

330
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,947
We'll go over the rules at dusk.

331
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,870
<i>What is this,
Fight Club in the redwoods?</i>

332
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,742
- I haven't eaten all day.
- Yeah.

333
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,328
Let me tell you a story.

334
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,792
One time I got caught in a 'lanche,
split-boarding at 'Hoe.

335
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,795
In the snow two hours
before they rescued me.

336
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,006
Most suffocate in five minutes.

337
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,218
If I can survive that,
pretty sure you can survive this.

338
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,806
Let me translate.

339
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,394
Cary got stuck in an avalanche in Tahoe.

340
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,355
Must we abbreviate everything? Confusing.

341
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,400
Who's got the arms to gather fuel with me?

342
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,484
I'm on it.

343
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,988
Chop-chop. Let's run.

344
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,453
Yeah! Let's do this!
Fire is life, boys. Fire is life.

345
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,456
- You actually like these trips?
- I like that Andrew likes them.

346
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,502
No, in all honesty, they really have been
a savior for our marriage.

347
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,504
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,299
How?

349
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,092
We come undone.

350
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,096
The first time I came out here,
I wept like a baby.

351
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,268
All it took was trying to make fire.
Some make it farther before they break.

352
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,437
Why would anyone wanna get to that point?

353
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
Your kid hasn't reached the terrible twos

354
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,277
or my personal favorite,
the fucking fours,

355
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,112
but he still has tantrums?

356
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,740
Henry's an overachiever in that area.

357
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:46,912
So don't you ever wanna scream
and cry and break shit?

358
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,708
Cary says this trip's about being a man.
I think it's about being a kid again.

359
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,792
Hmm.

360
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,378
Here.

361
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,875
You can have a meaningful experience
while maintaining

362
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,051
a normal blood-sugar level.

363
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,595
Thank you.

364
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,692
Hello. Welcome. What can I get you?

365
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,403
Uh, yeah, can I get one of everything?

366
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,365
Oh. I forgot my wallet again.

367
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,449
Ugh.

368
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,076
Well...

369
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,330
That's all right.

370
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,459
On the house. Study fuel.

371
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,002
Mm.

372
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,506
I'm actually taking some time off.

373
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,385
To process the whole Natalie thing.

374
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,471
You could have told me
you were struggling.

375
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,351
No, I couldn't 'cause you drew a line.

376
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,187
- No more e-mails, only Ubers.
- Right.

377
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,855
Thank you.

378
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,773
But, um...

379
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,611
I am worried about you.

380
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,238
Are you?

381
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,327
'Cause I've been worried about you.

382
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,582
I... I heard your husband yelling at you
the other night,

383
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,043
and I know that we are, like...

384
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,297
Whatever,
but if you need someone to talk to...

385
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,716
- Yeah, I have friends for that.
- Right.

386
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,052
Sherry Conrad.

387
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,181
- We have more in common than you think.
- You're both human women.

388
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,265
Totally.

389
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,976
Come on, she's, like, an inch deep.

390
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,439
You're only friends
because she's the only option in town.

391
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,316
It's not a crime to fit in, Theo.

392
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,903
Maybe you'll understand that
when you're older.

393
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,572
You've changed.

394
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,909
That's not always a bad thing.

395
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,704
Enjoy the muffins. Okay?

396
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,564
I learned this mating call
outside of Cartagena.

397
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,985
Three minutes later, a doe popped out
of the brush, started nuzzling my cock.

398
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,695
<i>Will it ever stop?</i>

399
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,656
All right, let's go. Circle up!

400
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,200
Rules!

401
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,788
One, we already know, make our own fire.
Well done, my brothers.

402
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,705
Whoo!

403
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,583
Two, we only eat what we kill.

404
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,709
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

405
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,839
Three, issue with a fellow hunter?
You fight it out.

406
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,635
Four, no phones, no shirts. No exceptions.

407
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,679
Other than that,

408
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,098
no rules!

409
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
- Yeah!
- Grunt!

410
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,226
Scream!

411
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,646
Embrace your inner beasts!

412
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,442
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

413
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,944
Yes!

414
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,949
Come on! Let's go, Goldberg!
I'm gonna get you dirty tonight, boy.

415
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,159
<i>Shit.</i>

416
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,626
<i>Love, you had your tribe in L.A.
You even found one here.</i>

417
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,301
<i>But if this is my pack,
I think I'm meant to be a lone wolf.</i>

418
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,824
You ready to feel like a high-speed,

419
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,805
low-drag apex motherfucking predator
out there?

420
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,476
Shit.

421
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,107
Thattaboy.

422
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,734
Now listen to that drum.

423
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,359
Huh?

424
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,571
How does it make you feel?

425
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,655
<i>Appropriative.</i>

426
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:56,578
You've been disconnected for so long
that your manhood is literally shrinking.

427
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,373
Love told Sherry about your dick issues.

428
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,541
<i>You told her?</i>

429
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,250
Come on.

430
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,836
Feel that.

431
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,631
You feel alive right now, don't you?

432
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,425
And you want more.

433
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,844
Tell me I'm wrong.

434
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,137
<i>He's wrong.</i>

435
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,222
It's fine.

436
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,889
I do, yeah.

437
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:24,105
You're my charge tonight, Joe.
I'm not letting you leave my side.

438
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,073
Now we hunt.

439
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,743
I can't believe they said no presents.

440
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,746
At least I won't be paying
for his therapy.

441
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
Got any more wine?

442
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,924
Hello?

443
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,427
Theo, I can't talk.

444
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,347
You're where?

445
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,891
Keep up the pace, Goldberg.

446
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,063
I didn't give you permission to stop.
Beasts don't stop.

447
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
Faster.

448
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,282
- Wait. Hang on. I need a second.
- Boo-hoo. Get up.

449
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,743
- I need a minute.
- There are no time-outs in life.

450
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,037
On your feet.

451
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,457
Jesus Christ.
Does your penis have mounds on it?

452
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,044
<i>No. I am not that guy,
as much as Cary deserves it.</i>

453
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
Quiet.

454
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,172
- You hear that?
- What?

455
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,636
<i>Oh, what the fuck now?</i>

456
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,305
Wait here.

457
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>Things aren't gonna work out
between me and Cary.</i>

458
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,186
<i>I'd say now is my chance to escape.</i>

459
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,772
<i>But if he doesn't come back, I'll starve,</i>

460
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,358
<i>or be eaten by whatever I'm hunting.</i>

461
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,277
<i>This is what I get for being a pacifist.</i>

462
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,196
Woo-hoo!

463
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,741
- <i>Uh... No.</i>
- Take it.

464
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,284
- Take the squirrel.
- No.

465
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,994
- Kill it.
- No, no, no.

466
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,956
Are you okay with your life as it is?
If you wanna get your dick up again...

467
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,293
- I don't see how the two are related.
- It's about being a man!

468
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,628
Let go of the squirrel. You're hurting it.

469
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,013
Yeah. You think I'm a bully?

470
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,056
Fine.

471
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,225
You know the rules.

472
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,145
"You got a problem with a fellow hunter,

473
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,522
you fight it out."

474
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,653
Come on, Joe.
I'm gonna need you to hit me.

475
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,114
<i>No one is coming to save you, you pussy.</i>

476
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,867
I'm not playing this scene
from this movie.

477
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,371
Come on, bro! Clock me, motherfucker!

478
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,997
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

479
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,417
Fucking hit me!

480
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,794
Now!

481
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,727
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

482
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,252
<i>No one is coming to save you.
What you gonna do, Goldberg?</i>

483
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,336
Don't!

484
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,521
- Help. Help.
- What happened?

485
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,732
- Cary...
- He fell.

486
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,649
Is he okay?

487
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,775
- He fell.
- Shit.

488
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,985
Hey! No phones.

489
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,112
Are you serious? This is an emergency.

490
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,281
- He's not breathing.
- Shit, there's no signal.

491
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,575
- He's dead.
- We don't know that.

492
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,119
What's going on? Oh, God.

493
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,371
We don't know that. He might not be.

494
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,416
Come on. Come on.

495
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,418
- Come on!
- What are we gonna do?

496
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,086
Come on, wake up.

497
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
Wake up.

498
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,673
What are you doing, Goldberg?

499
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,094
You saving me?

500
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,473
I'm fucking moved, man.

501
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,642
- Oh, my God. You're alive.
- Of course I'm alive.

502
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,688
Been taking glutathione for a decade.

503
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,942
I'm impossible to kill.

504
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,113
Ooh.

505
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,835
And this fucking guy...

506
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,239
<i>He's gonna tell them
I threw him off a fucking cliff,</i>

507
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,008
<i>that I'm crazy, whatever
the opposite is of "part of the tribe."</i>

508
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,053
Goldberg is a fucking animal.

509
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,971
Come here.

510
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:24,072
You are one fine specimen of a man, Joe.

511
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,503
Let it out.

512
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,472
Yes, Joe. Let it out.
Good man. That's it. You got this.

513
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,391
You got this. This is your 'Manjaro.

514
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,354
- There he is.
- You're good.

515
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,978
Welcome to the other side.

516
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,193
You got this. Yeah!

517
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,697
<i>I came to the woods,
afraid of the darkness inside me,</i>

518
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,199
<i>but they saw it</i>

519
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,243
<i>and accepted me anyway.</i>

520
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,413
<i>Is this what it feels like
to have friends?</i>

521
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,416
<i>Fitting in is not always the worst.</i>

522
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,503
<i>Yes, they're silly. Yes, what happens
out here is fucking nuts.</i>

523
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,921
<i>All I know...</i>

524
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,508
<i>is I feel like me again.</i>

525
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,322
- I didn't think it would take so long.
- You could have killed yourself.

526
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,325
- Or someone else.
- That might be stretching it.

527
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,785
- You don't know that!
- I was driving a scooter.

528
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,289
An electric scooter.

529
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,668
Ah.

530
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,172
They arrested you
for driving drunk on a scooter?

531
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,255
Yeah.

532
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,641
You ever been on one?

533
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,853
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

534
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,563
- Ready for the hill?
- Yeah.

535
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,773
We're charging the hill.

536
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,613
Let's go!

537
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,617
Oh, fuck.

538
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,291
- Ow.
- See? It's not that easy.

539
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,376
Is it?

540
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,504
I can't believe
I've never done that before.

541
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,424
Well, you know, it is a perfectly
socially-acceptable way

542
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,885
for adults to get around now, FYI.

543
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,517
Um...

544
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,731
So the rumors about...

545
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,112
me taking a leave of absence
because of Natalie...

546
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,030
Um...

547
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,992
They're not true.

548
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,535
I...

549
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,164
I'm flunking out because...

550
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,419
I can't stop thinking about you.

551
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,889
If you want me to shut up, I will.
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

552
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
I'm just trying to figure out...

553
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,690
how I can focus when all I want is you.

554
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,650
Theo, shut up.

555
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,693
No.

556
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,988
It's like you're playing house.

557
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,575
But none of this actually makes you happy.

558
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm playing house?

559
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,790
You're a teenager chasing
after a married woman.

560
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,584
What's your endgame?

561
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you go to the bakery
for that frosting tip or Alaska?

562
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,294
I got distracted
with the sourdough starter.

563
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,838
I saw that boy get out of your car.

564
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,424
What are you doing?

565
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,470
It's nothing. I'm just helping him out.

566
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,307
You missed Henry's first steps.

567
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,726
What?

568
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,646
You might have seen
if you'd picked up when I FaceTimed you.

569
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,690
Oh, he's down for the night now.

570
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,028
Love, Love,

571
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,656
all parents make mistakes.

572
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,865
God knows I did.

573
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,909
I missed my son's first steps.

574
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,702
It was anticlimactic.

575
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,288
I don't even think
I really remember yours.

576
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,249
What the fuck am I even doing?

577
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,418
I mean, I'm happy here.

578
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,797
- Everything's fine if Joe would just be...
- Blame Joe all you want.

579
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,633
The truth is, you preferred him
when he was a problem to fix.

580
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,093
You like someone to save.

581
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,011
It's the dynamic you had
with your brother.

582
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,763
So let me be blunt. Grow up.

583
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,600
That boy will distract you from your son.

584
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,146
I know you love Henry,
but that doesn't mean you won't harm him.

585
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,986
Here, have some of my cab sauv.

586
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,489
Much healthier addiction than a teen boy.

587
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,911
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my crush Rachel Maddow is waiting.

588
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,120
This is very impressive.

589
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,166
Hey. Hi. Wow, you made it home on time.

590
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,793
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

591
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm...

592
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,756
I think
Henry's a little young for hunting.

593
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,549
These are gifts from Cary.

594
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,218
They're for us. His and hers.

595
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,344
Huh.

596
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
Wow.

597
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,474
Hey.

598
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,851
Hi, hi.

599
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,692
- Hey, you smell bad.
- Yeah, I know, it's awful.

600
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,571
I'm gonna shower,
but first, I need to apologize.

601
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,241
- No. Joe...
- I have been working so hard

602
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,618
to keep myself in line,

603
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,872
I forgot there are healthy ways
to let things out.

604
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,708
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about...

605
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,211
You don't need to tell me everything.

606
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
I trust you.

607
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,803
- Wow. That was some weekend you had.
- Yeah. Really, it was.

608
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,806
Fuck, okay, okay.

609
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,725
- People are here. Get a shower real quick.
- Yeah.

610
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,809
Okay.

611
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,237
- Hi.
- Hi.

612
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,450
<i>I can't remember a time
when I didn't long for someone</i>

613
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,619
<i>who totally accepted me.</i>

614
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,664
<i>The bad with the good.</i>

615
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:18,379
<i>Why is it that a person who can do that
always comes at a cost?</i>

616
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,469
Your friend Paulie's doing better.

617
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,389
Thought you might wanna know.

618
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,354
If you'd given it back to that bully,
I wouldn't have told on you.

619
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,607
It's what he deserves.

620
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,736
- I chickened out, I guess.
- Yeah.

621
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,531
'Cause you're not like him.

622
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,369
I know what it feels like
to get picked on.

623
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,665
I'm sorry, it's not fair.

624
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,756
We'll look out for each other.

625
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,341
Deal?

626
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,843
Deal.

627
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,063
<i>You were right, Love.
This party wasn't just about him.</i>

628
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,523
<i>We did it. We kept him safe.</i>

629
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:24,278
<i>Doesn't mean he'll happy all the time,
it just means we're here for him,</i>

630
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,488
<i>no matter what.</i>

631
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,080
Oh, my God.

632
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,332
Oh, my God.

633
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,834
You're an animal.

634
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,716
I think we're gonna have to get...

635
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,968
somebody to...

636
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,722
soundproof the bedroom.

637
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,933
- I think I know a guy.
- Mm-hm.

638
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,187
What?

639
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,148
- Fuck.
- What is it?

640
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,444
Fuck. The bakery. The alarm's been off
for, like, four hours.

641
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,654
It's probably okay.

642
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,533
- What if someone...?
- Look, I'm sure the sensor's

643
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,577
- just on the fritz, but I'll go. I got it.
- Yeah?

644
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,412
I really got it.

645
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,582
<i>And by that,
I'm afraid what I really mean...</i>

646
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,086
<i>is that I used primitive tools
to carve out the time and space I need</i>

647
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,797
<i>to go on a certain kind of hunt.</i>

648
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,972
<i>I'll admit, this is all a bit elaborate.
And this ploy will only fool you once.</i>

649
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,226
<i>But after what happened with Natalie,
you can't blame me for covering my tracks.</i>

650
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,856
Oh, fuck.

651
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, my God.

652
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,959
Oh, fuck.

653
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,045
<i>Cary actually taught me
an important lesson, Love.</i>

654
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,256
<i>I can't completely cage
what's inside of me</i>

655
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,384
<i>or, when it bursts out,
it comes for blood.</i>

656
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,513
<i>Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,</i>

657
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,391
<i>keep it on a leash, take it out for walks,</i>

658
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
<i>but make sure it knows the rules.</i>

659
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
<i>No keepsakes.</i>

660
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,105
Are you okay?

661
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,484
<i>No social media, just watching.</i>

662
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:32,114
<i>So now I have you, Marienne.</i>

663
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,202
<i>Arms always full of books.
Never leaving the library before dark.</i>

664
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,912
<i>No one to hurry home to.</i>

665
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,873
<i>We're just friends.</i>

666
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,709
<i>So, what is it about you?</i>

667
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,253
<i>I can't pin it down.</i>

668
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:51,759
<i>All I know is that I've felt more alive
these past few days watching you</i>

669
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,970
<i>than I have in a long, long time,
Marienne.</i>

670
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,850
<i>But... you can trust me
with this secret, Love.</i>

671
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,813
<i>Juggling the two of you is confusing,
I'll admit.</i>

672
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,566
<i>But I'm up for the challenge.</i>

673
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,068
<i>You won't find out.</i>

674
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,611
<i>You can't.</i>

675
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,322
<i>I'll be careful. So, so careful.</i>

676
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,033
<i>Things will be different this time.</i>
