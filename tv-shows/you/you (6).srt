1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,177
Previously on You...

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,595
Joe Goldberg?

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,431
I heard about you and Candace.

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,808
She thought she could be happier
with some guy in Rome.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,644
Peach doesn't go anywhere
without that laptop.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,438
If only I could see inside.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,940
Guinevere Beck?

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,151
This is the work of a sick mind.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,153
She's obsessed with you.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,071
She wants you all to herself.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,117
It is exhausting being your friend!

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,077
I don't need to love
your self-absorbed poetry

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,287
in order to be kind to you.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,456
Beck rarely knows what's best for her.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,082
I couldn't agree more.

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,086
It's freeing in a way, to know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:46,963
Paco, what did you do?

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,924
I didn't know how many sleeping pills
would knock him out.

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,767
Hey, you.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,729
Peach was attacked in Central Park
in broad daylight.

21
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,481
I'm headed to the ER now.

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,690
She's alive?

23
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,240
It's been three whole days
since I've seen you.

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,242
I failed you, Beck.

25
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,080
And this is my punishment.
Is this my walk to the gallows?

26
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,582
Should I be preparing last words?

27
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,794
Some humans, Beck, are cancer.

28
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,129
Peach is stage four metastatic.

29
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,591
I tried to cut out the mass
before it consumed you. But now?

30
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:36,221
Best case, I gotta go in there
and win an Oscar kissing the ring.

31
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,806
Worst case...

32
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,225
she knows it was me.

33
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,060
And it's over.

34
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,648
Is this an ambush?
Will you love me in prison?

35
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,193
Hi.

36
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,153
Oh, no.

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,202
I can't believe I told you to get involved
with your neighbor's shit.

38
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,162
It's okay. It's not your fault.

39
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,413
God, I've missed you.

40
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:03,832
How's Peach?

41
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,543
Oh, as well as can be expected.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,671
Um, do you mind taking off your shoes?

43
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,174
And anything that has touched
other people or the subway?

44
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,092
Sure.

45
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,854
Look who is here.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,198
How are you feeling, Peach?

47
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm on to you.

48
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,289
Hmm?

49
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,251
Is this it? The noose, tightening?

50
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,004
You play the gormless ne'er-do-well,
and yet...

51
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,047
-And yet?
-It was you.

52
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,094
You're the one that warned me.
I have a stalker.

53
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,263
Ha!

54
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,224
-Oh.
-We're trying to figure out who it is.

55
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,978
You know, they say most people
are stalked by someone they know.

56
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,230
I mean, isn't that terrifying?

57
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,400
It's like I'm finally understanding
the dark side of celebrity.

58
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,153
This beauty blogger I know
is on her third stalker.

59
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,989
Becks, I'd love some more tea.

60
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,783
Oh, my shackled Cinderella,
if Peach gets her way,

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,745
you'll be making organic concussion tonic
until your beauty fades.

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,247
Oh, do you want some?
It'd be good for your head.

63
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,832
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

64
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,292
You have pages due.

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,670
You have a boyfriend with a black eye.
None of this is okay.

66
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,676
Actually, I'm gonna...

67
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,975
Hey, how long is she gonna stay here?

68
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,062
I don't know. Maybe indefinitely?

69
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,690
She's afraid to stay at her house,
which I understand.

70
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,736
They let her out of the hospital
pretty quick.

71
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,323
Like, three days.
I mean, it was a concussion.

72
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,201
I don't think
she should be your responsibility.

73
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,285
Hey...

74
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,497
when this is all over,
let's go away somewhere.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,499
Just you and me.

76
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,833
Sorry to interrupt.

77
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,670
No, it's fine. What's up?

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,757
Just, you know, given everything
that I've been through, um,

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,095
male energy in my healing space just
isn't optimal.

80
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,808
So, would you mind
asking Joseph to leave us?

81
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,227
I think he heard you, Peach.

82
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,731
I don't need confrontation right now.
And have him take his gift with him.

83
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,366
I gotta run some errands.

84
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,577
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,874
Uh, Beck, my tea?

86
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,843
Peach, come lay down.
You look dizzy.

87
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,433
Peach, you really need to relax.

88
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,359
Paris. Two tickets. First class.
I underestimated her.

89
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,488
She's not thinking about me at all.
She's busy making you all hers, forever.

90
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,824
And I put you right in her pocket,

91
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,993
where you can't write, you can't love.

92
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,370
You can't be you,
if you're living for Peach.

93
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,458
I won't let it happen.
I need a new plan.

94
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,793
I'm glad you were all here for me.

95
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,254
Because, now,

96
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,548
it's war.

97
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,940
Hey, Joe!

98
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm so sorry, Joe.

99
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,075
It's okay. It's okay, man.
We're good. We're good, I promise.

100
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,701
Go inside, mijo.

101
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,171
Just a little something to say thank you.

102
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,007
-A specialty. Fudge brownies.
-Oh, thank you.

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,843
It was kind of you to get involved.

104
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,805
I know things have been
a little bumpy here, the past few weeks.

105
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,306
Try months.

106
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,434
I just want you to know
that we're working on it.

107
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,147
So, if you're thinking
of pressing charges or anything...

108
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,316
And expose Paco's
little chemistry experiment? No.

109
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,234
Claudia--

110
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,528
This whole experience
really did something to Ron.

111
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,613
And I know how it sounds,
but I feel like it changed him.

112
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,156
Like he wants to do better.

113
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,034
People don't change.

114
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,538
And I'm not gonna press charges.

115
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,873
Thank you, Joe.

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,000
I owe you one.

117
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,932
-Hey.
-I only got a minute.

118
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:17,895
Peach is getting an IV vitamin treatment
across town, but I wanted to see you.

119
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,355
Is everything okay?

120
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,526
Listen, I'm going away for a few days.

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,948
Peach's family has a place in Greenwich
and she said she'd feel safer there.

122
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,741
I bet she would.

123
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,076
And what about school?

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,745
-What about us?
-Joe, she almost died.

125
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,913
But not quite.

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,669
I know you've been through a lot,
but risking your future

127
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,629
for the same person
who tried to sabotage your career,

128
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,383
like, a week ago...
I mean, it's a little crazy.

129
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

130
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,183
But I'm always gonna be honest with you,
and honestly...

131
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
she's manipulating you.

132
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
Why in the world would she want--

133
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,066
Because... You really can't see this?

134
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,821
If you become your own person,
she won't be able to control you.

135
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,953
I know that you don't want to hear it,
but the suicide attempt was a show.

136
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,122
She was never in any real danger.

137
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, so, she just attacked herself
in the park?

138
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,585
No. No. I'm not saying that.

139
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,255
Good. Because the whole victim blaming
is starting to sound a little 4chan.

140
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,134
Yeah. Uh...

141
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,599
She's in love with you.
You know that, right?

142
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,398
-I gotta go.
-Beck, no. I'm sorry. Wait--

143
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,735
No, it's fine. Thank you for being honest.

144
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,199
Okay. Think.
Peach is taking you out of town.

145
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,992
But that's just a prelude.

146
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,996
She eases you into her world
and then snatches you away forever.

147
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,874
I'd follow you, of course,
but, Beck, I hate French food,

148
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,626
and you love New York,
and I need to save you.

149
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,963
Ah, my face is killing me.
Thanks a billion, Ron.

150
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,716
Okay, Greenwich.
That's where this stops.

151
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,927
Connecticut's Gold Coast.

152
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,846
Land of hedge fund managers
and Mayflower descendants.

153
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,181
Shouldn't be hard to find you.

154
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,934
World gets a lot smaller when
you only have to search one percent of it.

155
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,854
And just like that,
the Internet gods provide.

156
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,149
Only an hour drive.
I love a mini road trip.

157
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,527
I used to take 'em all the time
with Candace.

158
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,198
It'd be nice to make new,
happier memories, actually.

159
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,040
If I'm headed into one-percent land,
I'll need to look the part.

160
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,917
So, thank you, Benji.

161
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,506
This is not how I lose you.
No hesitation this time.

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,508
This time, I finish it.

163
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,802
I'm coming, Beck. I'm--

164
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,024
♪ I know you belong ♪

165
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,403

172
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,803
Candace?

173
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,555
Oh...

174
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,933
Bunny, are you okay?

175
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,596
-Morning.
-Morning.

176
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,014
Car trouble?

177
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,392
No. No.

178
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,394
-No, but I--
-License and registration?

179
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,983
-I was robbed.
-Robbed? By who?

180
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,154
Have you had anything to drink
this morning, Mr...

181
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,574
I need to think, or it's game over.

182
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,284
I'm sorry, Spencer Hewitt.

183
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,911
Can you step out of the car, please?

184
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
Absolutely.

185
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,466
Put your hands on the Buick, sir.
Take off your glasses, please.

186
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,852
You gonna tell me
what happened to your face?

187
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,450
Morning, Beckalissima.

188
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,243
What are you doing?

189
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,245
Just eating breakfast.
I was starving.

190
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,748
You don't eat any of this.

191
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,625
Just felt like carpe-ing the diem.
You know.

192
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,752
When I was a kid, I used to come up here,

193
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,046
and my aunt would
make this massive spread,

194
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,298
and, I don't know,
I guess I got inspired by the memory.

195
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,134
It's easy to forget sometimes.
You wanna go to the mall?

196
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,890
Um, you haven't shopped retail since
the Steve Madden incident freshman year.

197
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,059
I feel like slumming it.
And then we can get lunch.

198
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,186
I am craving pizza like a madwoman.

199
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,230
We can top it off with a matinee.
What do you say?

200
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,775
I don't know. It sounds like a lot.
I'm kinda tired.

201
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,568
And that's my fault.

202
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,364
I've been a lot to handle lately,
and I want to make it up to you.

203
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,200
So, why don't you eat your breakfast
and get dressed?

204
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,826
And then, let me spoil my best friend.

205
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,620
Now, eat up.

206
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,002
Just kids. They really
kicked the shit out of me, though.

207
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,755
Took my wallet and my wedding ring.

208
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,927
-Not your watch, though.
-No. No, I got lucky, I guess.

209
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,721
Lucky he wouldn't know
an 80,000 Genevan timepiece

210
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,516
if it slapped him in the dick.
Thanks, Benji.

211
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,102
Apparently, it doesn't take brains
to be a criminal.

212
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,311
Just balls.

213
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,982
If Opie's gonna bone me,
I wish he'd lube up and get on with it.

214
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,819
I'm gonna have to go run your plate,
then I'll let you get home to your wife.

215
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,904
Must be nice being married to a doctor.

216
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,865
Sure is.

217
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,702
You get out on the water much, Officer?

218
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,208
Yeah, you got the look. I can tell.
Listen, be our guest next summer.

219
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,586
The old man's bringing the yacht up
from Nantucket.

220
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,712
What model?

221
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,216
Azimut 62S. The Guinevere.

222
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,052
Quick little minx.

223
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,763
You see that? Contempt.

224
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,182
Opie just decided I'm a rich tool

225
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,644
and of no consequence to
the health and safety of his jurisdiction.

226
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,730
He won't run my plates.

227
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,856
You know...

228
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,693
maybe you should just get home.
Get some rest.

229
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,655
No rest for the wicked,
but I appreciate the concept.

230
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,949
-Thank you so much.
-Drive safe.

231
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,857
I'm just here to be close by
if you need me.

232
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,944
I don't trust Peach, Beck.
And neither should you.

233
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,323
This place is a castle.

234
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,993
Complete with wicked witch
and damsel in distress.

235
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,997
Guess that makes me your knight.
For you, Beck, yes.

236
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,045
Ah, I wasn't planning to break in,

237
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,673
but if you're gonna leave
the back door wide open...

238
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,098
Okay. Nobody home.

239
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,809
My head.

240
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,038
All in all, I thought it'd be worse.

241
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,507
I got a concussion once,
playing soccer, when I was 12.

242
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,426
Puked my brains out.

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,304
Not fun, but nowhere near enough
to keep me from my mission.

244
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,933
If anything, it means I need to patch up,

245
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,645
focus, get back in the game.

246
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,334
Oh, wow.

247
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,422
I'm so glad
we got away together like this, Bunny.

248
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,259
This place is adorable.

249
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,806
I'm not leaving this bed
for the next 48 hours.

250
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,558
You in?

251
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,810
Oh, I'm in.

252
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,609
I love you, you know?

253
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,108
The spirit of the '90s is alive
in Greenwich.

254
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,319
I can't wait to see that dress on you.
You have to try it on.

255
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,489
So cold.
I think I'm gonna take a bath.

256
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,618
Oh. Use the one in the master.
It has well-placed jets.

257
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,623
- I like the claw-foot tub.
- Of course you do.

258
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,543
Because you're classy.
Cocktail? I'll get you one.

259
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,092
I want to give you
a life this grand someday.

260
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,510
God knows, you deserve it.

261
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,596
Darling, I made you a Negroni.

262
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,347
Minus the unwanted pressure

263
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,683
from an obviously unstable,
obsessed person, of course.

264
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,815
My hatred for Peach
has practically become sentient.

265
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,568
Now, take your time and relax, okay?

266
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,320
I've got a surprise for you
when you get out.

267
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,281
Oh, and don't forget to use
that geothermal mud mask.

268
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,909
- It is life-changing. Cheers.
- Thanks.

269
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
Look at that!

270
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,645
How dare she
invade your privacy like that?

271
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,940
It's perverse! God, I have to pee.

272
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,671
I'll double back for that.

273
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,009
Now, how long is she going to
stand there staring at you?

274
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,106
Hello?

275
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,900
Anyone here?

276
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,242
- Who is that?
- Um...

277
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,494
It's the surprise.

278
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,832
She has a gun, Beck.

279
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,877
She's not in her right mind
and you know it.

280
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,379
I have to do something.

281
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,841
80% of gun accidents happen in the home.

282
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,061
Why is Peach dressing you up like a doll?

283
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:39,149
Okay, I'm wearing this ridiculous thing.
What's my surprise?

284
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh, my God! Raj!

285
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,406
Hey, gorgeous. Long time no see.

286
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,535
I can't wait to catch up, doll.

287
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,843
I thought we said no phones.

288
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,889
Sorry. It's just my brother.

289
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,392
All right. Let's duet.

290
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,105
You know any Sabbath?

291
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,567
Uh...

292
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,037
It's funny
what sticks in your brain.

293
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,498
Sounds. A bit of song.

294
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,999
Give us one second, Raj.

295
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,129
And now, I fear, this chucklehead's
voice calling you gorgeous.

296
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
I knew Peach was an instigator.

297
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,592
And this is when her trap
starts closing in.

298
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,178
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I thought it'd be fun.

299
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,181
What happened to you not wanting
to be around male energy?

300
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,309
- I feel much better now.
- Well, that makes one of us.

301
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,105
- You're still mad at me. I get that.
- Do you?

302
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,985
I said your poetry was self-absorbed.
And I'm sorry my words hurt, but--

303
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,320
- But?
- Hear me out.

304
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,033
You are one of the most
talented people I know,

305
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,327
and I hate to see you
conforming to a system

306
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,872
that is designed to crush individuality.

307
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,790
If you want to be a great writer,

308
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,835
you have to get out there
and live a life worth writing about.

309
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,629
What do you want me to do, Peach?
Live off the land?

310
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,633
Cousin Inez finally vacated
the Paris flat.

311
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,676
I talked to my dad.

312
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,137
He said I could have it
and oversee the renovation.

313
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,514
She had a pet ocelot. There was damage.

314
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,558
Wait, you're moving to Paris?

315
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,187
We are moving to Paris, chérie.

316
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,860
Peach, this is crazy. I--

317
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,821
I don't need an answer right now.
Relax.

318
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
I just want you to trip on it.

319
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,284
Hence, Raj.

320
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,913
Look, Paris could be a new beginning
for the both of us.

321
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,999
Say you'll think about it.

322
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,627
Don't do it.

323
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,922
Okay.

324
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,299
Okay.

325
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,894
Ladies first.

326
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:27,192
Okay! To old friends and new experiences.

327
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,109
Cheers.

328
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,242
I haven't been
this relaxed in weeks.

329
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,244
Wait until that baby kicks in.

330
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,539
So, what did we take
with utter blind trust in you?

331
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,752
Pure MDMA, the slightest dash
of organically-sourced opium.

332
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,796
Well, way to go, Walter White.

333
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,965
I could never blame you, Beck.
Not even for this.

334
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,216
Peach is a master at her game.

335
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,469
Step one, get you alone
in a secluded house.

336
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,389
Step two, invite this Raj person over,

337
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,474
fill you with drugs
and get you to cheat on me.

338
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,310
Step three,
steal you away to Paris forever.

339
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,443
Had to get everything
put away and tidy for Raj, didn't you?

340
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,195
I need to find that gun.

341
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,534
So what have you been up to, Raj?

342
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,453
Well, you know,
finishing up medical school.

343
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,913
Wham, bam, get it done.

344
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,750
What have you been up to, Guinevere Beck?
Still writing?

345
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,503
You should read her poetry.
It's beguiling.

346
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,797
Honestly, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

347
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,551
I thought I did,
but lately it hasn't been so clear.

348
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,645
It was here.

349
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,148
I bet you're doing better than
you think you are.

350
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,942
Beck's just having a little
writer's block. It'll pass.

351
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,946
I want to write
a book about an injured soul.

352
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,533
Someone who doesn't feel like they have
a place in the world as we know it.

353
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,744
Someone on the outside.

354
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,954
You should write about my stalker.

355
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,918
- I love that.
- I know you do.

356
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:19,095
Peach is playing with me.
She knows I'm here. This is all a trap.

357
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,221
I sound crazy.

358
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,183
Head injury. The car.
I might be a little crazy right now.

359
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,976
No. No, no, no. I'm not.

360
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,979
I'm not. This is real.
She had a gun. Somewhere.

361
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,606
You're not safe.

362
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,278
Raj, feel how soft this feels.

363
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,704
It is soft.

364
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,540
You smell good.

365
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,626
So do you.

366
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:19,155
Platonic massage train! I call front!

367
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,574
I need a sec.
I'm spinning out.

368
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,784
I got you.

369
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:35,547
Is this rock bottom?
Because it sure feels like it.

370
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,510
Do you see now?
I would do anything for you, Beck.

371
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,808
I don't know why Candace followed me here.

372
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,437
It's like I hit my head
and bad memories jolted loose.

373
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,899
It's a coincidence, Beck.
You and she are nothing alike.

374
00:28:54,983 --> 00:29:00,530
Nothing. Or maybe you are.
I can't tell anymore.

375
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,701
-How good does that feel?
-Oh, my gosh.

376
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,746
Ah.

377
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,123
Beck, run!

378
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,002
Can't you feel what she's doing?
What she wants?

379
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,298
Don't you want to run?

380
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,555
Maybe you don't.

381
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,437
- Okay, way too far.
- Yes.

382
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,901
-I said, "Platonic massage train."
-Oh, Beck, you're always so skittish.

383
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:42,197
Yeah, "platonic" means
friends just being friendly.

384
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,408
Yeah, well, I have a boyfriend.

385
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,869
Yes, you do. My perfect girl.

386
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,372
-Well, I don't.
-Me, neither.

387
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,750
I think I need to dance.
I'm gonna go dance.

388
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,628
I feel bad for Peach, really.

389
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,881
It's tragic not to be able to show
who you really are.

390
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,591
And it's turned her poisonous.

391
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,301
That feels good.

392
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,303
Okay, no.

393
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,346
Yeah, a little lower.

394
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,974
Oh, my. I bet Harry
never had to do this for Sally.

395
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,184
- Like that?
- Yeah.

396
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,394
Okay.

397
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,023
I have something. Okay.

398
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:17,941
Hi.

399
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,238
Hi.

400
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,368
I think I'm done
being mad at you now.

401
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,376
Okay, be right back.
Just gonna climb in from off this ledge...

402
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,669
You're cute.

403
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,548
I really am sorry.

404
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,010
I know. Joe?

405
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,429
Yes?

406
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,891
I don't want to go to Paris.

407
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,770
Note to self: no Paris.

408
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,024
Okay.
I know he's down here somewhere.

409
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,860
- All right.
- Um...

410
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,154
I swear it was here. I just used it.

411
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
Oh. Okay.

412
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,286
Another thing I keep learning...

413
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,037
- Yes.
- You got it?

414
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,915
Things can always get worse.

415
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,127
- You want this?
- I don't not want it.

416
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,462
Okay. Here he comes, Big Daddy.

417
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:27,385
Oh, Beck, I'm so boned.
But not as boned as Raj is about to be.

418
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,804
Oh, God, that's interesting.

419
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,611
I feel like Colonel Kurtz.

420
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,071
An entire night of listening
to Peach Salinger.

421
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,408
Over, and over, and over,
and over, and over, and over.

422
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,245
The horror.
One thing got me through the long night.

423
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,999
My mantra. You miss me.

424
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,184
Packed already?
We don't leave for another two days.

425
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,312
Yeah, about that.
I'm going back to the city.

426
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,733
Good. Great. You have stuff to wrap up.
And then, Paris!

427
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,027
Okay, I've thought about it.

428
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:32,700
Thank you, but I belong in New York.
I'm not ready to give up yet.

429
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,246
Give up?
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.

430
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,541
I mean, do you want to be an artist
or an institutionalized cliché?

431
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,585
You're asking me to quit my MFA,

432
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,922
leave New York, my friends,
my relationship--

433
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,257
Oh, good God,
you've known him for like five seconds.

434
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,301
- I'm just saying that--
- Do yourself a favor.

435
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,179
Have some self-esteem,
and lose the creepy retail loser.

436
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,514
Do we have to go there?

437
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,641
-I'm just being real.
-Okay, you wanna be real?

438
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,393
What was that last night?

439
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,813
-What was what?
-You kissed me.

440
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,567
We were all rolling.

441
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,489
-You always do this.
-What? What do I do?

442
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,740
Drama out of nothing.

443
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,201
I mean, you were really high.

444
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,413
You were leaning into me,
and quite frankly, being very initiating.

445
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,665
-What?
-And I went with it, because, whatever.

446
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,917
It was a party.
I didn't want it to be weird,

447
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,627
'cause I'm your friend,
and that's what friends do.

448
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,795
That is not what happened.

449
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,132
Jesus Christ, Beck. Be an adult, okay?
Take a little responsibility.

450
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,050
Can we slow down? I'm just saying...

451
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,097
Shit, I'm trying to say
I am your friend, so, if--

452
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,515
Jesus Christ.

453
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,184
I know your family. I know how they are.

454
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,811
I know they wouldn't be okay--

455
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:45,773
No. No. I'm sorry, you have issues. Okay?

456
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,318
Don't make your desperate
unending need for attention about me.

457
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,320
This entire conversation is insane.

458
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,615
Okay, can we back up for one second?

459
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,745
I am not attacking you.
I came here to take care of you.

460
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,582
Of me? Oh, that's rich. It really is.

461
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,753
Peach, you know, Joe sees it, too.
He's been trying to tell me.

462
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,298
Of course Joe is behind this.

463
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,844
Joe is trash. Joe is nothing.

464
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,140
You're my family.
I'd die for you. Would he?

465
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,309
In a heartbeat.

466
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,563
I need a break.

467
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,065
And what?

468
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,402
Go slum it with a proletariat?
I give you a week.

469
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,945
My Uber's here.

470
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,615
So, what?

471
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,159
You're just gonna abandon me
when I need you the most?

472
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,036
What about my stalker?

473
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,956
I'll text you the number
of a private security company. Call them.

474
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,959
I can't believe you.

475
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,753
After all I do for you!

476
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,547
You just use people!

477
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,070
You are good, Beck.

478
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,196
You're medicine.

479
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,989
You are the antidote for liars,

480
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,409
and you make cheating a distant memory,
and right now,

481
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,914
I love you so much,
the ringing in my head is music.

482
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,998
Hey!

483
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,084
Give me my phone!

484
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,421
I don't have your stupid--

485
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,633
I'm not cheating on you.
He's an A&amp;R guy!

486
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,678
I have to seem available, okay?
It's just business.

487
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,680
Business? We've been through this.

488
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,141
Yeah, we sure have.

489
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,893
You're lying. You cheated on me.

490
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,481
You broke my heart, Candace.
I let you go! Isn't that enough?

491
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,566
There's something wrong with you.

492
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,901
I thought some time away
would mellow you out,

493
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,405
but you're jealous, you're paranoid.
You need help!

494
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,322
Give...

495
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,910
Joseph.

496
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,594
Why are you in my house, Joseph?

497
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,264
Oh, I should've shot this Medusa
when I had the chance.

498
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,017
Peach, put the gun down.
I can explain.

499
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,476
This is breaking and entering.

500
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,146
I'd be totally within my rights
to shoot you right now.

501
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,441
I... I'm here picking up Beck.

502
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,068
Beck's in an Uber.
What are you doing here?

503
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,574
My God. You.

504
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,284
What?

505
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,037
You are my stalker.

506
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,498
Oh, I knew something was off about you,
and I was right.

507
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,210
How long have you been obsessed with me?

508
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,087
Don't deny it, you little shit.

509
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,090
You stole my Ozma, you stole my laptop,

510
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,760
and at this point,
I'm convinced you attacked me in the park.

511
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:05,389
Why... Wait, why would I attack you
if I'm so obsessed with you?

512
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,934
I don't know how your twisted mind works.
Because you're sick?

513
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,852
You couldn't be more wrong.

514
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,770
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, really?

515
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,813
Then why are you here, Joseph?

516
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,692
Why are you here, Peach? Why are you?

517
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,405
Beck.

518
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
Oh.

519
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,118
This is about Beck, isn't it?

520
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,539
I know what you said to her.
You got in her head,

521
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,378
because you can't stand to share her
with somebody so much better than you.

522
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,089
I mean, you were just trying
to get me out of the way.

523
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,590
Oh, my God.

524
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,810
Why are you wearing Benji's watch?

525
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,023
- Why are you wearing Benji's watch?
- You're right.

526
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,361
You're right. I stole your laptop.
I found all the files.

527
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:05,324
The ones you keep on your friends.
The ones with the naked pics of Beck.

528
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,745
Now, is that for blackmail,
or personal use?

529
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,082
It's an impressive collection.
I made copies.

530
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,876
Now, I have no plans to share,
but if anything happens to me,

531
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,173
my associate, Paco, has been instructed
to publish all the files online

532
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,093
and send a link
to your entire address book.

533
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,054
Now, we can walk away from this.

534
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,141
Peach, we can do that.

535
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,144
We can let it go.

536
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,064
It never happened.

537
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,399
Then, what?

538
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,693
We can go back to New York
and pretend to be friends?

539
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,861
If you like.

540
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,447
No. I don't want you near Beck.
You're dangerous.

541
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,698
I'm better for her than you are.

542
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,577
Take the ticket, Peach. Go to Paris.

543
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,121
Clear your head. Find a nice French girl.

544
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,081
'Cause you know, deep down,

545
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,541
she's never gonna love you
the way you love her.

546
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,751
Stop saying that.

547
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,003
She's never gonna do it.
You can't have her.

548
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,713
Stop saying that!

549
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,117
Joseph?

550
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:10,449
Family, friends, lovers,
and all the rest, forgive me for this.

551
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,578
But it's not like you can say
you didn't see this coming.

552
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,457
I've always had a complicated relationship
with my own existence.

553
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,963
I was given a second chance on life
after the attack in the park,

554
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,258
and I've decided not to take it.

555
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,760
I thought I could change,

556
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,013
and by changing myself,
alter the world around me.

557
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,766
But change is a fool's pipe dream.

558
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,938
This world is ugly and crass.
People lie and people leave,

559
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,233
and the beauty that does exist
is fleeting and insincere.

560
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,735
Still, every now and again,

561
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,114
someone comes along
who will make you believe in love.

562
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,492
And if you find that person, don't let go.

563
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,205
And maybe together,
you can keep the monsters at bay.

564
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:03,836
I was never that lucky.
So, I'm ending things on my own terms.

565
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,255
Know that I love you all...

566
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,176
and hope we will meet again
on the cosmic highway.

567
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:14,972
Stay amazing. Love, Peach Anaïs Salinger.

568
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,186
What could I do?
She was never going to let you go.

569
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,396
Dispatch to Nico.

570
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,482
Go ahead.

571
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,816
I ran that plate
you asked for.

572
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,612
Car's registered to an Ivan Mooney.
Address in Manhattan.

573
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,531
- Stolen?
- No. Not reported, anyway.

574
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,533
Thanks, Diane.

575
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,313
Well...

576
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,774
you said you owe me one.

577
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,364
You're lucky.
The bullet only grazed you.

578
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,702
I feel lucky.

579
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,913
You wanna talk about it?

580
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,832
Not really, no. If you don't mind.

581
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,043
A favor's a favor.

582
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,759
So, I took your advice. I kicked Ron out.

583
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,929
You were right. People don't change.

584
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,515
Besides, I didn't like the way
he was treating Paco.

585
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,684
The kid needs a real
father figure in his life,

586
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,102
not some drunken asshole, you know?

587
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,329
That was nearly a week ago.

588
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,249
It's been a whirlwind since then.

589
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,293
I thought I'd have to
explain my wounds to you,

590
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,586
but you didn't even notice.

591
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,842
I suppose I can forgive you for that,
what with your best friend dying and all.

592
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,678
You did ask me
to go to the funeral with you,

593
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,263
which I think is a good sign.

594
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,225
You need emotional support right now,
and that's my specialty.

595
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,935
So, the fridge is fully stocked.

596
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,857
I grabbed a couple of Xanax off Annika,
just in case.

597
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,443
You're going to get through this.

598
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,989
It'll take time, but I'll give you
as much time as you need.

599
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,490
And I know, once the dust settles,

600
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:42,077
you will find
you're better off without her.

601
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,581
You might not ever admit this, of course,

602
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,667
but I'll know, and that will be
all the validation I need.

603
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,045
I'm gonna head out.

604
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,131
Just text me if you need anything, okay?

605
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,638
Okay.

606
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,517
Joe?

607
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,437
Yeah?

608
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,230
Can you stay?

609
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,615
I can stay as long as you want.
