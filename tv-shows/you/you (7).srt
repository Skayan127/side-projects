1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,802
Previously on You...

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:15,306
I love our little routine.
Always the same, but never stale.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,435
Your father was never consistent,
and you're still healing from that.

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,352
With my help.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,438
And guess what?
Now that I've made our mornings sacred,

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,273
you're actually writing.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,734
One day, I'll tell you about Candace.

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,068
She broke my heart.

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,195
But you are good.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,656
You make cheating a distant memory.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,491
Peach is taking you out of town.

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,118
I need to save you.

13
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,875
License and registration?

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,334
I'm sorry, Spencer Hewitt.

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,627
Dispatch to Nico.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,963
Car's registered to an Ivan Mooney.

17
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,047
I kicked Ron out.

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
You were right. People don't change.

19
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,593
Peach has it out for me.

20
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,386
If I just keep being
the perfect boyfriend,

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,223
you'll realize that life is
so much healthier away from this toxicity.

22
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,350
You have issues. Okay?

23
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,687
Don't make your desperate
unending need for attention about me.

24
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,314
It's freeing in a way,

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,775
to know for certain
what I have to do to protect you.

26
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,942
Anyone here?

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,569
I would do anything for you.

28
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,413
I'm not a bad person.
She was going to ruin you.

29
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,124
But you're safe now. Thanks to me.

30
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,716
That first perfect month,

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,095
we'd been to hell and back,
we'd done the hard work,

32
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,432
and we were closer than ever.
We were living the dream.

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,062
Couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Couldn't keep anything off each other.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,649
I was ready to wait it out
during the grief period,

35
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,566
no matter what that looked like.

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,321
But it only brought us closer together.

37
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,452
That month after the funeral was...

38
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,247
It was intimate. Real.

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,334
It just made us...

40
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,461
more.

41
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,261
But then, over the next few weeks,
something happened.

42
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,519
Falafel.

43
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,315
I couldn't tell you the exact moment
things went wrong between us,

44
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,278
but. uh, wrong they have gone.

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,782
So, that's why you're here in therapy,

46
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,410
to find out why
your relationship went south?

47
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,412
Oh, it didn't just go south.

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,083
It's over. And I want to know why.

49
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,555
Listen, here's the deal.

50
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,808
Don't think of this as an office
or me as a shrink.

51
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,561
We're just two dudes shooting the shit.

52
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,733
Why don't we start
when things were good with you two?

53
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,653
Hmm, my first kiss? Good question.

54
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:21,826
I was 14,
and I was going out with this boy, Matt.

55
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,287
You know, we told each other
all the good stuff.

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,541
He was so sweet.
And we went to see Hitch together.

57
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,834
Oh.

58
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,754
And I was waiting for him
to make the move.

59
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,632
Waiting?
So, what? That was your first kiss?

60
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,010
No, it was two nights later
on a school camping trip.

61
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,932
In a tent, in the rain.
With his best friend, Chad.

62
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,935
-Chad?
-I know.

63
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,395
- Chad?
- I know.

64
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,273
But Chad, he just... He went for it.

65
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,067
And I've always had trouble
with that kind of thing.

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,111
The whole good guy versus bad boy bit.

67
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,116
Don't look at me that way.
Trust me, I wish I could have a redo.

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,036
I still feel like a hootsie for it.

69
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,996
A "hootsie"?

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,624
That should totally be a word.

71
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,168
No real words?

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,586
Only fake ones.

73
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,296
- Punkclassical.
- Photobomb.

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,256
- Vajazzle.
- Ravey.

75
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,592
We connected on every level.
It doesn't get any better.

76
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,011
Everythingship.

77
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,974
I love that. It's, like, our word.

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,769
Everythingship. A noun.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,483
A meeting of the minds, bodies and souls.

80
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,446
Okay, Beck. You ready?

81
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,370
Wait, it can't be.

82
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,457
Are we redoing my first kiss?

83
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,459
We're redoing your first kiss.

84
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,378
Wow.

85
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,007
I'm finally gonna kiss the right guy.

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,885
It was an everythingship.
It really was.

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,138
We were in a really healthy place.

88
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,685
I had even stopped relying on,
you know, these certain crutches.

89
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,687
- Crutches?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,607
Checking social media,
sneakin' a peak at a locked screen.

91
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,737
It was time to stop. 'Cause we were real.
I just needed to--

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,696
Trust.

93
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,824
Sure.

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,035
I'll see you after work.

95
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,290
Yeah, about that. I may have gotten fired
from the yoga studio.

96
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,585
May have?

97
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,546
I got fired.

98
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,841
Apparently I fell asleep leading Savasana.

99
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,012
It's fine. I can find another job.
I can...

100
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,346
Come work at Mooney's.

101
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,931
I know, I know. Big step.

102
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,476
-Joe.
-Come on. It's perfect.

103
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,352
Flexible hours. You have time to write.

104
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,063
I want to help.

105
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,440
I can't ask that of you.

106
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,692
Well, you're not asking. I'm offering.

107
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,987
But big steps feel right
in an everythingship.

108
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,073
Yeah, yeah. I get that.

109
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,329
Oh, don't worry about this.

110
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,916
I'm in early stages of asymptomatic
glaucoma, so I got a prescription.

111
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,502
I swear this makes me
such a better listener.

112
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,087
They should do a study.

113
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,516
So what happened next?

114
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,478
Oh, hey, Ethan,
do you mind taking a picture of us?

115
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,604
Oh...

116
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,486
Uh... I'm sorry,
I think I just need to sit down.

117
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,323
I pre-gamed the new Safran Foer
by reading Eating Animals,

118
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,743
and I'm test-driving veganism now
and I'm just feeling a little faint.

119
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,911
Oh...

120
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,996
Of course.

121
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,255
You two are absolutely adorable,
and I am a lonely, vegan island.

122
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,341
Someone needs a burger.

123
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,593
Or somewhere to put his meat.

124
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,266
Okay, that was bad.
I meant it sympathetically.

125
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,603
-We have a hashtag now?
-Too much?

126
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,646
It's perfect.

127
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,940
What happened next was
we were doing great.

128
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
It was safe to open up
about the very hardest things.

129
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,573
You know, uh, Peach went on a date
with JSF in high school.

130
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,326
I thought that grief was really
the last frontier.

131
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,913
Apparently he ate pork belly.
Very scandalous.

132
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,124
I mean, Peach always said that...

133
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,918
Um...

134
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,839
-You can talk about her, you know?
-Yeah, I know.

135
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,008
You haven't mentioned her
since the funeral.

136
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,217
It's been over a month.

137
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,094
And we were at that frontier together.

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,224
Actually, I think I'd rather save it
for therapy, if that's okay.

139
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Therapy?

140
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,480
Except, it turns out, we weren't.

141
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,734
Yeah. I used to go,
about a year ago, but I stopped.

142
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,277
But then after Peach, I thought it was...

143
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,740
worth it to go for a bit.

144
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,411
Honestly, Dr. Nicky's been really helpful
dealing with my grief.

145
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,165
I think we need more stars.
They're in your office, right?

146
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,208
Yeah.

147
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
Don't get me wrong.

148
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,671
There's nothing wrong
with going to therapy. It's just...

149
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,966
It's a bit troubling when your partner
hides something from you.

150
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,636
Don't you agree, Dr. Nicky?

151
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,014
I hear you, Paul. Not cool.

152
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,183
Forgive me, Beck,

153
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,393
but for the purposes of this session
with your therapist,

154
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:44,148
you are Renaldo, tall, dark and man-bunned
backup dancer for Beyoncé.

155
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,317
And I, Paul, well, I manage a bar.

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,945
Every asshole in this city
has the same, not-so-special problems.

157
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,072
It won't be hard to hide who I am.

158
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,326
You two seemed pretty copacetic,
sort of...

159
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,663
Things were Ross and Rachel
with you and Renaldo.

160
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,041
Yeah, I guess they were.

161
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,670
Until they weren't.

162
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,839
See, I thought I'd eliminated
all the obstacles between us, Beck.

163
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,094
Benji. Peach.
But now, another has reared its head.

164
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,887
And he's sitting right in front of me.

165
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,271
All right, Paul,
let's keep digging into this.

166
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,732
All right, tell me, when did you see
the first cracks with Renaldo?

167
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
Well, having Renaldo at work
was amazing,

168
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,866
but it did force me to confront

169
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,328
some slightly careless aspects
of his personality.

170
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,921
I tried to cut him some slack.

171
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,843
You know, new job, and somewhere in there
he's still grieving, right?

172
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,471
-Hey.
-We need to talk.

173
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,681
About what?

174
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,809
Look, this is uncomfortable.
She's your girlfriend,

175
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,604
and, Lord knows,
I'm not one to criticize, but...

176
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,189
Beck is terrible, Joe. Okay?

177
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,400
She's always late.
She leaves the register open.

178
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,360
She doesn't know how to organize by genre.

179
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,529
Just this morning,
she chewed out a 14-year-old

180
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,741
for buying American Tragedy for school
because she hates Dreiser.

181
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,035
Everyone hates Dreiser,
but this is a bookstore, okay?

182
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,828
We're trying to sell books.

183
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,204
And I hear you, buddy.

184
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,832
You're caught up hard
in the tilt-a-whirl of punani.

185
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,209
And that is something
I struggle with every day.

186
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,419
But here's the thing, brother.

187
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:33,299
Shitting where you eat
just leads to confusion and E. coli.

188
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,428
So I'm gonna let you ruminate on that
for a little bit.

189
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,766
Yeah, we were a little imperfect.

190
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,353
But I still thought
we were in great shape.

191
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,063
If that was the worst of our problems.

192
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,073
Mooney's: Rare and Used.

193
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,408
This is Officer Nico,
Greenwich Sheriff Department.

194
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,078
I'm looking for a Mr. Ivan Mooney?

195
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,704
Speaking.

196
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,915
I'm calling about a Buick
registered to your name.

197
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,668
Yeah, I gave that car
to my nephew, Spencer.

198
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,669
Is he in trouble?

199
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,840
No, I was just calling about
a little fender bender he had.

200
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,593
It was nothing. Have a nice day.

201
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,640
That was too close.

202
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,146
I just saw my job as
keeping the outside world away

203
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,606
so Renaldo could heal.

204
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,317
Hey, Ethan said you were late again today.

205
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,821
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

206
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,116
It was hard to find a line
between boss and boyfriend.

207
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,410
Between supporting and enabling.

208
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,956
But you did say the hours were flexible,
and that I'd have time to write.

209
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,250
I did.
But you haven't been writing.

210
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,837
Thinking about writing
is a part of the process.

211
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,968
Okay, that sounded like bullshit
even as I said it.

212
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,636
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,847
The truth is,

214
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,976
I've been having really vivid dreams
about Peach.

215
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,563
I'm sorry about that.

216
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,982
It's not your fault. It's just...

217
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,484
Her face, it's...

218
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,364
fading, and I didn't think
that would happen so fast.

219
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,576
But she comes at night,

220
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,998
so now I am too tired to write
and falling behind at school.

221
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,002
And now I'm failing you
by being bad at this job.

222
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,463
I couldn't tell if I was helping.
I thought I was.

223
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,925
It's pathetic. The only good thing
in my life right now is therapy.

224
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,178
It's the only good thing?

225
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,346
Joe, don't be like that.

226
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,390
Or I was totally wrong

227
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,852
and there were dark forces at work
I wasn't privy to.

228
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,604
Claudia!

229
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,691
There are people who are fully
delusional about their relationship.

230
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,360
-Claudia!
-Get your scrub-ass outta here, Ron.

231
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,780
Karen, stop being a meddling bitch
and tell me where Claudia is.

232
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,034
For example,
my neighbor's alcoholic boyfriend

233
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,870
literally has to be chased away
with a baseball bat.

234
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,710
This isn't over, Karen.
You can't hide forever, Claudia!

235
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,921
-Do I know you?
-No.

236
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,340
You don't know me at all?

237
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,051
-No.
-Then what're you staring at?

238
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,889
But we were different, I thought.

239
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,936
It sounds like working with Renaldo
at the bar wasn't such a hot idea, huh?

240
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,232
I mean, sure,
it was difficult to navigate at times.

241
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,652
But it had its good parts.

242
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,736
Beck.

243
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:43,989
Beck.

244
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,585
♪ Unwind your watch ♪

245
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,007
♪ Shut your eyes a minute ♪

246
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:09,098
♪ 'Cause your heart killed mine ♪

247
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:16,605
♪ But now I close the distance ♪

248
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,233
-Hi.
-Hi.

249
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,569
What is this?

250
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,198
I thought we could use
a little date night.

251
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,082
Meatball subs. Your favorite.

252
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,796
Well? What do you think?

253
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,801
I think one errant candle could destroy
an entire collection of rare books.

254
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,845
But...

255
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,556
you...

256
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,350
are worth it.

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,942
I feel bad for girls who don't eat.

258
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,069
It always made me sad with Peach.

259
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,073
What?

260
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:13,829
Uh, you're talking
about Peach. It's good.

261
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,917
Yeah, I guess so.

262
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:28,636
You know, I had this Little Mermaid
sleeping bag when I was a kid.

263
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,139
God, I loved that thing.
But then it started to smell.

264
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,768
Bad. Like fungus bad.

265
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,896
I couldn't bring myself
to get rid of it, though.

266
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,607
-A security blanket.
-Exactly.

267
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,655
But then I lost it.
And even though I was sad,

268
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,366
I was kind of relieved because I didn't...

269
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,285
I didn't actually have to get rid of it.

270
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,084
And it's the same with Peach.
There is a part of me...

271
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,503
Oh, God, it sounds terrible.

272
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,382
Not that I am comparing Peach
to a cheap nylon sleeping bag. I...

273
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,222
This metaphor made a lot more sense
when I came to it with Dr. Nicky.

274
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,143
I think all this Peach stuff is coming up
because of my birthday.

275
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,230
December 3rd.

276
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,817
You remember.

277
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,485
'Course.

278
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,784
Anyway, Peach made such a big deal
about birthdays.

279
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,038
And she always made sure
I felt super special

280
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,041
and would plan the whole thing and...

281
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,377
now I don't...

282
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,130
-I'll handle it.
-No, Joe--

283
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,173
No, what do you want?
A night at the Met?

284
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,843
The tasting menu at Momofuku?

285
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,263
Hell, I'll even sing karaoke
with Annika and Lynn.

286
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,978
That's sweet.
That's really, really sweet. But I...

287
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,815
I think I'd rather keep it
low-key and small.

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,070
No. No to small. No to low-key.

289
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,075
I don't know, Lynn.
Beck was pretty emphatic.

290
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,412
Dude, Beck's a Sagittarius.
She craves attention.

291
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,080
This is a test, okay?

292
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,042
Part of the fun is making a guy think
that you don't want something

293
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,418
and seeing if he still comes through.

294
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,212
-No, Beck's not like that.
-Let me give you a little lesson on Beck.

295
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,007
Every year, she wants to "keep it simple."

296
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,178
And every year, whatever guy
that she's dating royally blows it.

297
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:38,432
And Peach swoops in on her Manolos
and throws Beck a party for the ages.

298
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,770
Only now, no Peach.
God rest her beautiful soul.

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,898
So you're saying throw a party?

300
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,733
I'll help.

301
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,487
I need a distraction.

302
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,781
And I think
because I was anxious about this,

303
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,033
my judgment was a little off.

304
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,577
If I bury my sorrows
in any more booze and boys,

305
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,412
I'm gonna get syphilis. Again.

306
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,957
And Annika's still at Esalen
on her grief retreat, so...

307
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,501
But she didn't like Peach.

308
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,294
None of us liked Peach.

309
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,047
But we loved her.

310
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:17,262
Losing a friend is super complicated, Joe.
I need this. Beck needs it.

311
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,224
Which is why I was stupid enough

312
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,601
to think Renaldo's friends
should be listened to, ever.

313
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,312
It'll just be some friends,
some NYU people.

314
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,439
We'll make it a surprise party.

315
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,650
Hmm? A book theme.

316
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,736
And everyone can come dressed
as their favorite literary character.

317
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,695
What do you say?

318
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,948
Put it to you this way.

319
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,368
Would you rather do something
and be wrong,

320
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,953
or nothing and be wrong?

321
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,122
Surprise party?

322
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:48,919
Mmm. I thought it would cheer him up
after the death of his beloved Shih Tzu.

323
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,463
Get his mind off of things.

324
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,298
And?

325
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,926
Did it?

326
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,262
It was the beginning of the end.

327
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,473
Because you threw him a surprise party?

328
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,018
No, because that's when I realized
he was cheating on me with his therapist.

329
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,579
Oh, shit. You scared me.

330
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,374
- What's all this?
- Uh...

331
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,585
It's my girlfriend's birthday.
I'm throwing her a little...

332
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,297
Well, it's not so little.
It's a surprise party.

333
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,841
Kind of a literary theme. Thus...

334
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm going as Ernest Hemingway.

335
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,222
Old Man and the Sea. The Sun Also--

336
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,308
I know who Hemingway is.

337
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,977
Nice cake.

338
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,938
She's lucky to have a man who cares.

339
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:14,880
Facon-wrapped date? Facon-wrapped date?
Facon-wrapped date?

340
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,299
- Thanks, man.
- Good call.

341
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,260
Facon-wrapped date?

342
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,347
It's 9:40. Beck was supposed to be here
at 9:00 to meet for dinner.

343
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,182
She'll be here. Relax.

344
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,267
You know what you need,
my friend, is a drink.

345
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,936
Hey, get this man a Catcher in the Rye.

346
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,354
No, no, no. It's fine.

347
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,855
- She's here!
- Oh!

348
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,233
Everyone, hide.
Places, people. Hide!

349
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,034
Surprise!

350
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,038
How American.

351
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,292
Who is that?

352
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,257
That's one of Beck's school friends,
I think. I don't know. I'm texting her.

353
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,595
I would have guessed, yeah.

354
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,266
What?

355
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,900
Rude to stare,
especially in Asian cultures.

356
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,361
Mr. Darcy, I take it?

357
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,239
-Indeed.
-Predictable.

358
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,949
Says Elizabeth Bennet.

359
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,617
God, no. Dorothea Brooke.

360
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,204
Middlemarch.
Named my shelter cat after George Eliot.

361
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,372
I love her.

362
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,041
-The cat or the author?
-Both.

363
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
Meow.

364
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,593
Hi, hey, I'm sorry.
Can we chat for second?

365
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,472
Oh, Joe, Joe, this is Constantine.
He lives in Bushwick.

366
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,935
That's fine. Where the hell is Beck?

367
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,312
Do you want to touch his mustache?

368
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,356
No. No, no. Lynn. No, Lynn,
I don't want to touch his mustache.

369
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,858
- Joe--
- I don't get it.

370
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,861
I've tried to be the perfect boyfriend.
I've bent over backwards.

371
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,655
I gave her a job. I threw her this party.

372
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,117
-What else can I do?
-People are puzzling.

373
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,537
Peach committed suicide
and she is the strongest person I know.

374
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,455
Knew.

375
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,457
Beck isn't just puzzling.
She's impossible.

376
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,503
Like, where is she right now?
It's selfish. It's rude.

377
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,464
- But it's Beck and that--
- Joe.

378
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,552
- Ah, shit. Hey!
- Surprise!

379
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,889
Can I speak to you for a sec?

380
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,647
Joe, this is not what I asked for.
I said quiet and I said small.

381
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,942
-Right, yeah. Lynn said--
-Oh, now you're listening to Lynn?

382
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,528
In retrospect, a misfire.

383
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,657
-Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
-I'm Hemingway. Again, misfire.

384
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,869
Look, I appreciate the gesture. I just...

385
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,207
I can't be at a party and pretend
that everything is okay without Peach.

386
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,833
I am not a robot.

387
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,504
Well, what about the other day?
The relief you talked about?

388
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,506
Grief isn't a straight line, Joe.

389
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,383
I know.
You've just been hard to read lately.

390
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,053
What is that supposed to mean?

391
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,516
-Where were you?
-I'm sorry?

392
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,309
Beck, I called. I texted you.

393
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:20,649
Yeah, I know, I just...
My, um... My therapy session ran long.

394
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,653
Dr. Nicky and I were really
making some headway.

395
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,531
And then I guess I just...
I went for a walk and...

396
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,701
-You guess? Therapy and a walk?
-Yes.

397
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,036
Then why do you smell
like three glasses of rosé?

398
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,498
Because I sat down at some stupid bar
with my journal

399
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,708
trying to work through shit, Joe.
That's it.

400
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,419
-Okay, so then why didn't you call me?
-I forgot.

401
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,839
But it's your birthday, Beck.
We made dinner plans.

402
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,092
Well, I just... I lost track of time.

403
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,803
Shit.

404
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,516
Beck, just tell me.

405
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,021
Just tell me. Tell me the truth.

406
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,649
And we can get through anything.

407
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,532
Okay, if you can't tell me, then show me.
Show me your phone.

408
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,537
Are you serious right now?

409
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,747
You said yourself,
you have a hard time with good guys.

410
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,083
-What are you talking about?
-The hootsie stuff.

411
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,920
Okay, I'm... Okay, fine.

412
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,465
You want to see my phone? Have at it.

413
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,970
But if you do this, it means
there is absolutely no trust between us.

414
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,556
And if we don't have trust,
we have nothing.

415
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,893
Do you trust me?

416
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,358
You know what? I can't do this right now.

417
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,112
Happy birthday to me.

418
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,793
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

419
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,379
♪ Happy birth... ♪

420
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,609
With his therapist?

421
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,072
You're sure?
That's a pretty heavy accusation there.

422
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,492
How do you know?

423
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,953
Experience.

424
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,870
Candace.

425
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,206
There are certain tells.

426
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,917
You can see it in their eyes
when they look at you.

427
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,044
You've been cheated on before?

428
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,338
My last relationship.

429
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,049
I was blind.
I only saw what I wanted to see.

430
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,717
But I didn't make that mistake again.

431
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,931
This time I made sure
that Renaldo was different.

432
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,852
So I knew if he was lying or cheating,

433
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,188
then someone was using him.

434
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,235
Look, I'm not one of those shrinks
that are obsessed with the past,

435
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,821
but I think in this case,
we should take a look.

436
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,656
Why don't you tell me
about your childhood?

437
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,700
But we're not here
to talk about my childhood, right?

438
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,285
We're talking about my relationship.

439
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,371
Which ended because of a surprise party?

440
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,623
No. That's not when it ended.

441
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,504
I brought you a donut.

442
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,177
It's glazed.

443
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,810
Oh, hold up.
So you were just back together?

444
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,353
Regardless of your suspicions?

445
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,814
Mmm, didn't matter. That was the past.

446
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,109
All right, so, what happened next?

447
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,610
Things were good at first.

448
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,904
But then, it started to feel
like something was different.

449
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,532
I feel like I'm hungrier than sushi.

450
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,952
-Okay, pizza?
-Too saucy.

451
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,497
-Thai?
-We had Thai for lunch.

452
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,422
Why do I always have to pick?

453
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,344
It's okay. I'll choose.

454
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,389
It's a horrible feeling.

455
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,808
To know things have gone wrong,

456
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,769
and there's nothing
you can do to change it.

457
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,909
Falafel.

458
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,959
You know something or someone
has come between you.

459
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,921
But I had to be sure.

460
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,467
-I'll see you after class, okay?
-Okay. Bye.

461
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,861
Heart. Heart. Heart.

462
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,133
I wanted to be wrong.

463
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,221
I never wanted to be wrong
so badly in my life.

464
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,515
I was begging to be proven wrong.

465
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,109
But it was looking like I was right.

466
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,618
You trust someone.

467
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,749
You give them your heart,
and what do they do?

468
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,836
Is there even a punishment
that fits the crime of lying,

469
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,923
of manipulating like this?
Of breaking someone's heart?

470
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,677
I guess I'm bad at picking good people.

471
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,513
But I'm good at catching
bad people red-handed.

472
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,612
Are you following me?

473
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,413
Answer me right now.
Were you following me?

474
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,623
No, no, no.

475
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,084
I was in the neighborhood
and then I saw you.

476
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,628
God, stop lying.

477
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,884
No, just... tell me why. Why, Joe?

478
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:07,013
It's the being late, the secret texts.
You've been different, Beck.

479
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,556
You're being crazy.

480
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,058
Are you sleeping with him?

481
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,142
Who?

482
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,563
-Your therapist.
-Oh, my God.

483
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,649
Are you? I need to know! I want to know!

484
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,652
No! I am not sleeping with him.

485
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,653
Who's the fox?

486
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,948
-What?
-The fox. The fox, Beck!

487
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,910
My friend. Emma Fox. From Brown.

488
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,872
But I guess that wasn't readily apparent
on the texts from my phone, huh?

489
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,088
-Beck--
-Don't.

490
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,425
Joe, I told you.
If we don't have trust, we have nothing.

491
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,053
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

492
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,389
Me, too.

493
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,727
You and I, we're over.

494
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,542
And that... That's when it ended.

495
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,003
That's one hell of a story.

496
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,924
-What's your diagnosis?
-My diagnosis?

497
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,093
Yeah, yeah. What do you make of it all?

498
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,137
Well, you might think I'm crazy

499
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,139
'cause I've only known you
48 minutes, but...

500
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,436
I think there's two of you.
Two Paul Browns.

501
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:42,066
One that's been hurt in the past,
feel betrayed and hopeless.

502
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,152
But the other one has faith,

503
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,572
and in spite of the evidence
to the contrary,

504
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,450
he believes true love exists.

505
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,912
And that is someone I think I can help.

506
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,293
Our time is up now,

507
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,421
but I'd be down to seeing you again,
if you'd like.

508
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,303
I don't think so.

509
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,488
Everything I do,
I do to protect you, Beck.

510
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,749
Peach, Benji, they left me no choice.

511
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,209
They were dangerous.

512
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,135
I think you might be in danger again.

513
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,410
But I need absolute proof first.

514
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,707
And these days,
the quickest way to a man's truth...

515
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,752
is through his computer.

516
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,972
And if I find what I'm looking for,

517
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,059
Dr. Nicky will be handled.

518
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:04,292
I mean, he followed me.
That's just... It's not okay.

519
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,086
I get it. You feel violated.

520
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,172
Pretend I'm Joe, okay?

521
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,631
What would you say to him right now?

522
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,761
The more you want me,
the less I want you.

523
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,222
I know it's messed up, but it's true.

524
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,937
Of course you think I'm hiding shit. I am.

525
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:31,152
Hiding what a complete, ugly mess I am,

526
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,823
behind this, like, cute,
acceptable version of being a mess.

527
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,991
It's insane.

528
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,997
I haven't dealt with the shit
that went on with me and Peach.

529
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,167
Or my dad. Or Benji.

530
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,504
And instead of putting it into my writing,

531
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,172
I'm hibernating with you.

532
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,055
And I resent you for it.

533
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,976
I need space to heal.

534
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,855
But every time I turn around,
you're standing there,

535
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,693
ready to make it all okay.
But only I can do that.

536
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,659
And if you really love me,
you'll see that.

537
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,080
You'll let me go.

538
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,842
Are you afraid
you might be pushing away a good thing?

539
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,136
Do you think Joe might be good for you?

540
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,390
Maybe. But it's what I need.

541
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,606
That doesn't sound like
an illicit affair.

542
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,153
That sounds like
a messed up girl in a crisis

543
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,156
and a pretty decent therapist
she's lucky to have.

544
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,999
It also sounds like you were right
to end it with me.

545
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,633
I was wrong about all of it.

546
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,805
The only thing I wasn't wrong about
was loving you.

547
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,393
So, I'm letting you go.

548
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,662
-Hey.
-Hi.

549
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,042
Thanks for opening the door,
all things considered.

550
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:57,381
Uh... look, there are a million things
I could say right now.

551
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,801
But all that matters is I'm sorry.

552
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,012
Thank you.

553
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,057
Jealousy got the best of me.

554
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:15,024
And I was threatened that you needed
someone to talk to who wasn't me.

555
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,236
And I know you deserve that.
You deserve to figure your stuff out.

556
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:24,700
And if I was a smarter man,
maybe I wouldn't let you go,

557
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,287
but I'm guessing that's what you need.

558
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,289
So I will.

559
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,344
Goodbye, Beck.

560
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,312
Goodbye, Joe.

561
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,610
Turns out, it is like the movies.

562
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,821
The second it's over,

563
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,199
all you can remember is the stuff
that made you fall in love.

564
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,702
Blazing through your mind,

565
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,580
this rom-com montage
made of the sweetest poison.

566
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,083
Everythingship.

567
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,710
I love that.

568
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,004
I’d never felt this way before,

569
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,506
where you love the bad things
about someone...

570
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,051
as much as the good.

571
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,723
Maybe even a little more.

572
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,185
Love isn’t a strong enough word.

573
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,024
And sometimes it scares me...

574
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,570
to love someone so completely
and not have them love you back.

575
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,950
I'm happy to see you here.

576
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,119
I didn't think you'd come back
after our last session.

577
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:56,500
Oh, that's the thing.
I don't... I don't understand it.

578
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,710
That's why I'm here.

579
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,462
-What don't you understand?
-Love.

580
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,341
You and seven billion other people
on this planet.

581
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,511
If we understood love,
I'd be out of a job.

582
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,390
I have to say, it's sort of unique
to everybody, like a fingerprint or...

583
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,770
a strand of DNA
or the song you lost your virginity to.

584
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,648
"Hungry Like the Wolf."

585
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,699
Some people have a hard time
letting love in.

586
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,120
Some people are built for love.

587
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,084
Some people... some people are searching.

588
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,629
Searching for someone who can love them
in the way that they deserve.

589
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,256
That's you.

590
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,426
- You look like shit.
- Thanks.

591
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,470
What happened?

592
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,349
My girlfriend dumped me, all right?

593
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,476
So, if you don't mind...

594
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,217
Mmm.

595
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,429
I love you, Joe.

596
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,434
Your face. Oh, my God.

597
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,935
I'm just messing with you.

598
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,258
Are you gonna leave Beck alone?

599
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,386
Or will she end up like me?
