1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,608
- So, Copper River next week then?
- Sounds good.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,193
- Is that a promise?
- You bet.

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,988
All right, fingers crossed.
Tell Theresa I said hi.

4
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,448
Thanks. Will do, Love.

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>I'm an optimist.</i>

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,872
<i>And that, Love, is why I'm gonna say,</i>

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>"I can't wait
to tell our story to our kids."</i>

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>I know, it's hardly begun,</i>

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>but it's how I've always been.</i>

10
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>Even as a kid, one glance from a girl</i>

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>and I was trying out
my last name with hers.</i>

12
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>I don't think that's wrong.</i>

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>I think love should come out of nowhere,
sweep you up completely.</i>

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>But let's not conflate optimism
with certitude.</i>

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>I've learned some hard lessons,</i>

16
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>fools do rush in.</i>

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>And I've been the fool more than once.</i>

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>If I'm honest, I saw red flags</i>

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
<i>and explained them away.</i>

20
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>I wanted love so badly,</i>

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>which is why I have to see
with clear eyes now.</i>

22
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,087
You know what?
I'm gonna wait for the kings.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,880
- Okay.
- Which is, like, soon?

24
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,675
<i>Find those flags
before we've gone too far.</i>

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,677
What's her name?

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,804
- Cindy.
- Cindy?

27
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>And this isn't to say
I'm not optimistic, so...</i>

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,726
<i>our story, I suppose it begins a week ago.</i>

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,524
<i>♪ All this time I was trying to find ♪</i>

30
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,902
<i>♪ Some drug to fill this hole ♪</i>

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,698
<i>♪ It was my mistake to trust in fate ♪</i>

32
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>♪ To show me the way to go ♪</i>

33
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,120
<i>I got here,</i>

34
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>and within minutes, I knew...</i>

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,999
<i>I'm in a strange land.</i>

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>Duck-lipped,</i>

37
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,004
<i>stoned, suspiciously happy lemmings
everywhere you look.</i>

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,466
<i>This guy, LA in a nutshell:</i>

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>the Unabomber with a three-picture deal.</i>

40
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,473
<i>Welcome to a city
where people trying to disappear</i>

41
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>aren't actually trying.</i>

42
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,685
Can I get a selfie with you?

43
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,769
Yeah, sure.

44
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>Poor guy.</i>

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,041
<i>Must really hate all the attention.</i>

46
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,085
- All right, have a good one.
- Hendy, can I get one?

47
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,694
<i>And then there was me,</i>

48
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>the one in four million
not wanting to be discovered.</i>

49
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,623
All right.

50
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,043
<i>Step one in my effort...</i>

51
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,628
<i>tacos</i>

52
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,088
<i>with a man with a means</i>

53
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,258
<i>to bring a new, unlocatable me
into existence,</i>

54
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>at least according
to his carefully worded ad on Craigslist.</i>

55
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:04,100
Ever think how basically everything now
is GMO frankenfood?

56
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,019
Like... like, what exactly

57
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,938
is all of this hacked corn
doing to our epigenetics, right?

58
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>Apparently, California's got its
own brand of conspiracy theorists.</i>

59
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>Yes, take caution,
lest you have a less-clean liver.</i>

60
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,698
...you can give pigs fresh air
so they don't even <i>need</i> antibiotics.

61
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,366
Just a thought.

62
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,328
- Cages are never the answer.
- Totally, never.

63
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,371
So,
what I need...

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,455
I got you.

65
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,208
Get out, no trace.

66
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,544
If I want to leave today, say...
say, to Mexico...

67
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,463
Great choice.

68
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,548
Food's cleaner, cheap,
you'll love living there.

69
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,925
But I can't stay forever.

70
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,343
I have unfinished business here.

71
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,511
But would not recommend a return trip.

72
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,306
<i>Getting out to escape Candace
was imperative,</i>

73
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,767
<i>but so too was the option to return</i>

74
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,685
<i>and actually deal with her
when I was ready.</i>

75
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,489
What I need is something
more comprehensive.

76
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,855
Okay.

77
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,981
Here's the deal.

78
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,403
Truly airtight, livable ID takes... years.

79
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,281
The Will you see before you,

80
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,743
I micro-tweezed
like a bonsai for a decade.

81
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,328
I'm employable.

82
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,248
Background check me,
good luck not dozing off.

83
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,041
Actual face online?

84
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,043
No, can't find it.

85
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,963
But google me and I feel real.

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,342
And that, my friend, is a labor of love

87
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,386
far too intensive to even put a price on.

88
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,388
Okay, I get it.

89
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,598
I appreciate you can even help me at all.

90
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,435
Uh, so do you have it with you or...?

91
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
Follow me.

92
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,316
<i>I realized
that with my Candace issues,</i>

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>buying what this guy had to offer
wasn't enough,</i>

94
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>and I didn't have ten years
to methodically sculpt a new identity.</i>

95
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,616
You got the benefit
of being a white dude.

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,369
No one <i>ever</i> suspects shit
when it's a white dude.

97
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,001
<i>I realized I needed to </i>be<i> him.</i>

98
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,764
<i>Will seems okay
for a guy who's been in a box for a week.</i>

99
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,475
<i>Without Mr. Mooney's help</i>

100
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,061
<i>it took two full days
to put this thing together.</i>

101
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>Stressful doing it
with Will watching me, tied up.</i>

102
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,292
You should be so proud of yourself.

103
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,900
<i>Three quarter-inch plexi's a beast.</i>

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>Yet those edges are a thing of beauty.</i>

105
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,946
...attention to detail...

106
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,115
<i>I gotta think Mooney would be impressed.</i>

107
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,326
I'm guessing it represents
more to you too.

108
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,162
Safe space, perhaps?

109
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,123
One you felt you needed
as a child for protection...

110
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,876
I know everyone in this town
likes to talk about their feelings,

111
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,337
so if you want a therapy session...

112
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,255
tell me about Jasper.

113
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,008
Look at you now.

114
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,345
Able to put yourself on the outside,

115
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,763
that must be so empowering...

116
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,556
Who... is Jasper?

117
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,891
Come on.

118
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,769
He said you have something of his.

119
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,771
He's looking for me.

120
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,982
- Cannot keep me in here, Joe.
- I told you, this is temporary.

121
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,275
Then what is the plan?

122
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,861
I'm... Look, I didn't...
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

123
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,404
I didn't... I didn't think.

124
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,781
I acted.

125
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,032
It was an emergency.

126
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,302
- You can let me out.
- That's great, I would love to.

127
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,703
Let's just figure out a way
to do that safely for us both.

128
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,374
As soon as Jasper goes away.

129
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,958
See, you're not hearing me.

130
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
This cage isn't great.

131
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,381
I need light.

132
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,216
I need my meds.

133
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,219
This isn't gonna be good for you.

134
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,597
If you want me to consider your needs...
just tell me what this guy wants.

135
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,143
Jasper Krenn.

136
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,063
Met him on what a layperson might term
"the dark web," all right?

137
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,107
Not even a client.
I looked into the guy...

138
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,067
didn't like, turned down the gig.

139
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,610
So you've never even met?

140
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,404
No.

141
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,072
He doesn't know what I look like,

142
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,783
so he won't know that you're just
some random asshole

143
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,986
who hit me in the head with a brick
and stole my life,

144
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,453
if that's what you're asking.

145
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,996
Okay, okay.

146
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,958
Okay, hold... hold on, hold on. You...

147
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,877
You charge a fee...

148
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,504
in advance of meeting.

149
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,467
You didn't give him his money back.

150
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,430
That is probably correct.

151
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,806
You have to pay him back.

152
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,934
I'd love to help, but I spent it.

153
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,354
And my earning potential
is somewhat curtailed by being in a cage.

154
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,231
How much do you owe?

155
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Three thousand dollars.</i>

156
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,698
<i>It's no problem.</i>

157
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
<i>It's just 2,700 more than I had</i>

158
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>due to the lack of planning
that preceded my departure.</i>

159
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,164
<i>Teach a man to fish...</i>

160
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,666
<i>you feed him for a lifetime.</i>

161
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>Teach him how to make a counterfeit book,</i>

162
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,047
<i>and maybe, just maybe...</i>

163
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,176
<i>he can cobble together
a little something worth...</i>

164
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,260
Three grand.

165
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,679
Best I can do.

166
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,725
Three grand it is.

167
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,894
<i>I'll admit, bar was low.</i>

168
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,439
<i>Mooney would have thrown the thing
back at me, had me do it 50 more times.</i>

169
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,110
<i>Fortunately, an LA bookseller
is practically an oxymoron.</i>

170
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,784
<i>At least now I'd be able
to send this Jasper fella on his way,</i>

171
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>get back to our story:</i>

172
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,662
<i>you...</i>

173
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,873
<i>the person who may</i>

174
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,084
<i>just make paying a $3,000 toll</i>

175
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>to stay in this urban Gomorrah</i>

176
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,003
<i>worth it.</i>

177
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,256
<i>If only you weren't such an early riser.</i>

178
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>It's becoming clear,</i>

179
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,719
<i>the more I see of you,</i>

180
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,223
<i>the harder it is to see you clearly.</i>

181
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,558
<i>If I don't want to get hurt,</i>

182
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>I have to keep a distance
till I've done my due diligence.</i>

183
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,603
Hey!

184
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,816
You keep wandering off. Here.

185
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>Though that's hard
when you keep inviting me to things.</i>

186
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,655
I just didn't want to get in your way.

187
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, that's impossible.

188
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,825
Wow!

189
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,827
Look at that opah.

190
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,931
- Is that Ecuadorian or local? Thank you.
- Local.

191
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,166
I know you're making
all of this up to impress me.

192
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,450
You don't have to try so hard.

193
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,462
If you told me that fish was an alien,
I would believe you.

194
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,007
No, that's why it's good
you took me up on this.

195
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,331
For a guy who works at Anavrin,

196
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,720
you sorely lack an understanding
of the pescatarian lifestyle.

197
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
I'm a pescatarian ignoramus.

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,270
Are you okay? You look a little...

199
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,854
Mmm.

200
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>No.</i>

201
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>Too soon, too much, too good.</i>

202
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,619
Yeah, I just wanted to stop
thinking about it and just do it.

203
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,412
Interested?

204
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,416
Hate the idea?

205
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,959
I'm sorry, what did you say?

206
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,127
Lunch today.

207
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,421
My friends.

208
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,424
I think we should
just rip the Band-Aid off.

209
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,594
They're very LA, but they're also great,

210
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,763
and... they're important to me.

211
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,513
So...

212
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,017
<i>And now you want me to meet
your friends?</i>

213
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>I really, really need
a clinical distance. No.</i>

214
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,563
I'd love to.

215
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,647
<i>Shit.</i>

216
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,907
Earth to Spock.

217
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,075
Come in, Spock.

218
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,661
Where'd you go, old sport?

219
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,497
You had that look
like when Keanu sees the black cat.

220
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,291
"Oh. Glitch in the Matrix."

221
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>We kissed and I saw the ghost
of Guinevere Beck,</i>

222
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,879
<i>my Matrix </i>is<i> glitching.</i>

223
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,089
Yeah.

224
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,507
Yeah, uh, no.

225
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,633
I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

226
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,716
You know what?

227
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,969
Let's see here.

228
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,890
How about we move the women's lit display?

229
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,642
Like, why are we separating them?

230
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,143
That's sexist.

231
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,061
Right?

232
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,148
And besides, I woke up
with a completely brilliant idea.

233
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,652
- What's the idea?
- Movies.

234
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,697
- On loop in... in the bookstore.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

235
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,448
Movies that are... wait for it...

236
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,200
also books.

237
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,327
<i>Kill it with fire.</i>

238
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
It's a great idea.

239
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,081
- Dope movies like <i>Pulp Fiction.
- Not based on a book.</i>

240
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,044
- Whichever of the <i>Star Wars...
- Again...</i>

241
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,876
<i>Fifty Shades,</i> obviously.

242
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,546
<i>One for three, marginally.</i>

243
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,049
We are gonna sell so many books,
it is going to blow your fucking mind.

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,177
- Can't wait.
- So just come clean this up,

245
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,470
set up the screen,

246
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,223
and when it all looks so cute
you wanna fuck it,

247
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,849
holla at your boy.

248
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,392
Namaste.

249
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
I'm sorry,

250
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,707
did you think this was a real bookstore?

251
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,444
Bless your heart.

252
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,154
It's cute.

253
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,081
Hey, Bettelheim?

254
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,666
<i>Jasper.</i>

255
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,713
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back.

256
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>This is Jasper?</i>

257
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>He looks like a manager
at a comic book store.</i>

258
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,093
Sorry, who you looking for?

259
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,346
Well, you, Mr., uh, Will B.

260
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,692
Girl at your apartment
said you worked here.

261
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,476
Did she mention that I left word for you?

262
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,145
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm Jasper.

263
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,439
Oh, right. Man, I have been
having trouble reaching you.

264
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,317
I'm sorry, my phone's been weird,
you know?

265
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,777
But here, your money.

266
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Here.

267
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,450
- It should all be there.
- All 50 grand?

268
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,744
<i>I'm sorry, 50?!</i>

269
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,704
That's some of it,
I got to liquidate the rest.

270
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,706
Oh. Oh, it's okay.

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,250
But I'll need it today.
Is that still all right?

272
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,084
That's great.

273
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
Perfect.

274
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,715
Hey, one other thing, uh...

275
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,799
- Sure.
- Check this out.

276
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,201
- Wanna show you something.
- What?

277
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,302
What are you doing?

278
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
It's okay, it's okay. Squeeze hard.

279
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,268
Right at the knuckle, a little higher.

280
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,270
Good. Good, good, good, good good.

281
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,479
Now...

282
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,232
I'm gonna need you to...

283
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,859
just gotta hold that for me.

284
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,611
Great, and, uh...

285
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
drop her in there.

286
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,614
There you go.

287
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,243
Now, over at St. Henry's
they have a fantastic microsurgeon,

288
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
Dr. Daniel.

289
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
As long as you're there
in the next 10, 12 hours,

290
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,831
good chance it'll reattach.

291
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
Provided you have this. So...

292
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,375
give me a call
when you have the rest of the money.

293
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,587
Probably sooner
better than later, I'd think.

294
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,661
Good to finally meet you, Will.

295
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,597
<i>This is bad.</i>

296
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,891
<i>Easily leave-town bad.</i>

297
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,645
<i>But this is your town, Love,
and I can't leave you.</i>

298
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,193
It's 50 thousand, Will! It's not three!

299
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,864
Can we please talk about
the <i>$47,000</i> discrepancy?

300
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,824
Can we talk about my hand?

301
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,492
<i>Oh, no.</i>

302
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,828
I told you everything.

303
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,414
I told you everything,
and now it's too late.

304
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,834
<i>I admit, I thought
his whole "needing meds" thing</i>

305
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>was a ploy.</i>

306
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,044
Fuck Jasper.

307
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,798
He's just some asshole
Russian mafia-adjacent wanker.

308
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,758
Were you even followed?

309
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,760
How would you even know,
you amateur!

310
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,054
They've found me and it's over

311
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,056
and you exposed us and now they're...

312
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,229
Oh... okay.

313
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,486
Oh... Will?

314
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,614
Hey, buddy.

315
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,701
Do you have any money anywhere?
Think, Will, think.

316
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Will, listen to me,
no one knows you're here.

317
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,250
No one can take care of you
if the guy you stole from murders me.

318
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
Am I making sense?

319
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,090
Rufus...

320
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,844
he owes me 50 large.

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
He's good, he just...

322
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,931
Text him the code word.

323
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,807
This is important.

324
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,434
When I was eight, I broke my arm,

325
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,062
and they put a pin in it
and it's been transmitting,

326
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,105
so don't you go to the hospital.

327
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,025
They will chip you like a dog,
you understand me?

328
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,945
Thank you so much for caring, Will.

329
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,698
I can and I will neutralize
that chip for you.

330
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,782
Okay.

331
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,494
What was that code word?

332
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>Apparently, Rufus is someone
who conveniently owes Will</i>

333
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>50 large.</i>

334
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,172
<i>While this feels too easy,</i>

335
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,092
<i>right about now the universe
owes me a little easy.</i>

336
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

337
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>That's not gonna work.
I have a lunch with you.</i>

338
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,983
12-2.

339
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,193
<i>And I hate Rufus.</i>

340
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,361
<i>Damn it.</i>

341
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,948
<i>I have to cancel our lunch, Love.</i>

342
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,497
<i>For the record, I'm opening sobbing.</i>

343
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
- Hey.
<i>- Just calling to hear if you were crying.</i>

344
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,674
- You sound fine.
<i>- Crying on the inside.</i>

345
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,591
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,678
<i>You're direct. You do what you feel.
You just pick up the phone.</i>

347
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,241
<i>I'm just sorry I'm not gonna see you.</i>

348
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
<i>This is how you handle rejection.</i>

349
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>You want me to not feel bad
about blowing you off.</i>

350
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,477
What can I say? Forty's a dick.

351
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,979
He sent me on a run to Alhambra

352
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,065
to get a sample of the competition's
compostable picnicware.

353
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,692
Forty said that?

354
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,405
Well, my coven's gonna be, uh...

355
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,074
sad they don't get to meet you today.

356
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>Yikes. Please don't let them hex me.</i>

357
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,953
<i>I'm sorry, I wanted to be there.</i>

358
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,621
Yeah, I know, me too.

359
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,789
Talk later, 'kay?

360
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,378
<i>Wanted to be there so much I decided
I had to at least drop by, you know?</i>

361
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,674
<i>I don't have the time to join you,
but I can spare a few minutes.</i>

362
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>Especially when I've learned
how friends say so much about a person.</i>

363
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,222
Will can't make it.

364
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,099
- He's sorry he can't be here.
- No.

365
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,393
<i>Like how influenced you are
by their opinion,</i>

366
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,521
<i>- how much they secretly run your life.</i>
- I'm bummed.

367
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,774
I was so ready
to meet your new man-friend.

368
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,942
And by "meet,"
Gabe means "judge and deem unworthy."

369
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,903
I'm sorry,
who are you talking about?

370
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,822
<i>Lucy Sprecher.</i>

371
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,034
<i>She met Love at a rally for LGBTQ rights.</i>

372
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>Back then, Lucy was an unpaid intern.</i>

373
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,664
<i>Now she's a social savvy power agent
whose clients include all the Jennifers,</i>

374
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,459
<i>the Kates, and the EU's
top-selling Instagram poet.</i>

375
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,768
- Okay, okay, okay!
- She is coming for me!

376
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,800
Just ignore Lucy, she hates everyone.

377
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,636
Please ignore Sunrise.
She overcompensates for my bitch face.

378
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah, I do, babe. You're welcome.

379
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,099
- I love it.
- Okay. Okay, have you...

380
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,182
<i>Here we go.</i>

381
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>Sunrise Darshan Cummings, Lucy's partner.</i>

382
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,107
<i>Ironically never met of sunset
she didn't like.</i>

383
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,858
<i>Stay-at-home mommy blogger,</i>

384

<i>and Earth guide

385
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>Sunrise cannot be this happy</i>

386
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,510
<i>unless blending functional mushrooms
in your almond latte</i>

387
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,077
<i>is the grail we have all been seeking.</i>

388
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,872
They source it from this incredible
biodynamic flaxseed guy.

389
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,208
<i>Whatever that meant.</i>

390
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,418
<i>Gabe Miranda.</i>

391

<i>Small business owner,</i>

392
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,173
<i>which in his case
means a pansexual acupuncturist.</i>

393
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,551
<i>"Student," air quotes, of psychedelics.</i>

394
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,013
<i>Mostly dates men, but does something
I'm not gonna try to pronounce,</i>

395
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,598

396

<i>fingering women to orgasm

397

<i>packaged as a spiritual practice.</i>

398
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,980
<i>And you and Gabe</i>

399
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>go back the farthest.</i>

400

<i>Besties.</i>

<i>So, this Is the Love squad.</i>

402

<i>Teeth-achingly, hippy-dippy,</i>

403
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>unaware of the glaring privilege,</i>

404
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,908
<i>driving their so-called conscious choices.</i>

405
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>Do they secretly want to sleep with you?</i>

406
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,954
<i>Own you?</i>

407
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,080
<i>Steal you away?</i>

408
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,498
<i>To Paris?</i>

409
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,462
- Oh, my God.
- Will and I kissed.

410
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,751
- You kissed?
- Yeah.

411
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,752
I love that.

412
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
I wish Will did,

413
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,215
'cause I'm pretty sure I scared him
and now he's avoiding me.

414
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>And this is it,
this is when I get annihilated.</i>

415
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,012
Well, then maybe he's an idiot
who should go fuck himself.

416
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,181
Okay, or maybe he's shy.

417
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,266
Love can be a little forthright.

418
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,184
Compliment.

419
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,936
So maybe the idea of meeting
three more of us is genuinely scary.

420
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,646
You're soft.

421
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,940
- Am I too forthright?
- No.

422
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,068
- Real men love that shit.
- Right.

423
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,487
Let's focus on what
is actually important here.

424
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,323
Which is...?

425
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,036
That your heart maybe wants back
in the game.

426
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,081
Maybe it's time.

427
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,127
I just, um... like him.

428
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,711
Aww!

429
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,965
I know I don't talk about...

430
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,884
James much.

431
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,095
I just really thought, you know...

432
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,056
I met my soulmate,

433
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,391
and that's done, and...

434
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,020
so the rest of my life will be,
like, you know...

435
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,813
Oh, honey, I know.

436
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,316
No, no, I'm...

437
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,775
It's fine.

438
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,986
But no one excites me,

439
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,988
you know, no one makes me miss them...

440
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,448
like James.

441
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,952
But now I'll just be doing something...

442
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,080
- random and I'll miss Will.
- Aw!

443
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,123
I don't even know him.

444
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,378
- Am I being crazy?
- Oh, no.

445
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
No, I think that maybe...

446
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,840
maybe you're falling for him a tiny bit.

447
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,885
That's so terrifying.

448
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,554
Aw. That's why
we're here for you, beautiful.

449
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,182
Waitress,
bring us all the desserts!

450
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,142
- I want 'em all!
- No!

451
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,226
Sorry.

452
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,729
<i>I take it all back.</i>

453
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,648
<i>I love your friends.</i>

454
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,483
<i>And I see you, Love,</i>

455
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,444
<i>I hear you, and...
I get it now.</i>

456
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,128
<i>Am I losing my mind?</i>

457
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>Hell, I've arrived.</i>

458
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>It's called the San Fernando Valley.</i>

459
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,602
<i>At the borders of which
anyone with an architect's degree</i>

460
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,062
<i>is apparently denied entry.</i>

461
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,315
<i>A party...</i>

462
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,191
<i>at noon...</i>

463
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,193
<i>on a Tuesday.</i>

464
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,748
<i>Well, I'm glad these people
found each other.</i>

465
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,833
<i>Look forward to never seeing them again.</i>

466
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>It'd be great if I had
the faintest fucking clue</i>

467
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>what this Rufus guy looks like.</i>

468
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:29,973
Hey.

469
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,516
I'm sorry to bother you.

470
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,270
Would you happen to know
if there's a Rufus here?

471
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,022
Are you John Mayer?

472
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,566
No.

473
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,984
No, I'm Will. I'm looking...

474
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,069
There you are, bitch.

475
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,653
He's not John Mayer.

476
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,115
You're a manwhore, John Mayer.

477
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>I'm guessing they won't be any help.</i>

478
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,709
Oh, my God, look over there.

479
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,712
Oh, my God. It's totally him.

480
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,464
<i>Hold on.</i>

481
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,009
<i>That's airport guy.</i>

482
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,803
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

483
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,491
<i>What is it about this guy that makes
people act like they're in a customs line</i>

484
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,641
<i>with an ass full of heroin?</i>

485
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,934
No, it's Hendy.

486
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,395
You gotta get a picture of him
with me in it.

487
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,104
<i>Hendy?</i>

488
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,523
<i>Hendy.</i>

489
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,066
<i>Okay, Hendy.</i>

490
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,359
<i>Comedian.</i>

491
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,531
<i>AKA Henderson. FKA Josh Bunter.</i>

492
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,493
<i>Kicked cancer. Interesting.</i>

493
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,704
<i>Is ostentatiously zen about it.
Predictable.</i>

494
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,542
<i>Wait a second, this is Vacuum Guy?</i>

495
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,168
<i>Ethan loved this gag.</i>

496
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
<i>Oh!</i>

497
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,882
<i>Brexit!</i>

498
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,051
<i>Right?</i>

499
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
<i>Apparently,</i>

500
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,432
<i>Hendy's got a hard-life-lessons
man-of-the-people thing working for him.</i>

501
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,605
Apartment three?

502
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,023
<i>Oh, great.</i>

503
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,026
Is this party gonna get any more weird?

504
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,237
- What happened to your hand?
- Uh... Oh, it's...

505
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,417
Oh, you're really not from here.
I asked, but I actually don't care.

506
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,506
I've been up for two days
chasing that whole Jared Padalecki thing,

507
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,121
but he's been laying low,
so I kind of detoured here

508
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,582
to find this hairstylist, Kido.

509
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,916
Word has it he can confirm...

510
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,462
<i>Really couldn't care less about Kido
or why Delilah's here at all.</i>

511
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,756
<i>If anything, I've only got more reason
to get the hell out of here.</i>

512
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,152
...Rufus who knows the owner of this house
who's a producer

513
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,803
- and he knows Kido...
- Wait, I'm sorry, did you say Rufus?

514
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,847
Yeah, my girl Tanika knows him.

515
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,891
The friend I'm looking for
has a buddy, Rufus.

516
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,685
Could you...
could you maybe point him out for me?

517
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,770
You're kidding me.

518
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,148
Delilah.

519
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,277
Hey, long time.

520
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,278
You look great.

521
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,989
I look like a walking red-eye
from Pittsburgh, but you look great.

522
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,152
- What are you doing here?
- Just working on a piece.

523
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,737
'Course you are.
Always the smartest girl in the room.

524
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,871
Yep. It's exhausting.

525
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,205
Yeah.

526
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,504
What, d'you go for
the president's curly fries?

527
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Sorry, this is Will.

528
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,420
Hi. No, it was an accident at work.

529
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,757
It might need surgery, but it's, uh,
you know, it's okay.

530
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
Well, if you do, Dr. Daniel

531
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
at St. Henry's Medical Center.

532
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,138
Uh, if you go, tell him we're friends
and he'll hook you up.

533
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,058
Thank you. Thanks.
Really, I appreciate that.

534
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,226
- Yeah.
- Hendy!

535
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,812
Uh... excuse me, guys.
Great to see you, gorgeous.

536
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,526
Well!

537
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,028
He seems pretty great.

538
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,864
Drool a little more,
it's a good look on you.

539
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,534
Did he come up in one of your pieces?

540
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,703
Meaning is there shit on him? Scoop?

541
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,957
- Inquiring minds want to know?
<i>- </i>Never mind. If you don't want...

542
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
Let me just give you
the <i>Idiot's Guide,</i> okay?

543
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,293
Being famous...

544
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,920
don't make you magic.

545
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,298
Cover shit in gold,
it's just super shiny shit.

546
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,262
I had a feeling you might know that,

547
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,844
but I was wrong, and now I pity you.

548
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,597
- Excuse me.
- Hold on. You gonna point out Rufus?

549
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,961
You're a big boy. Figure it out.

550
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,809
- Hey.
- Yeah?

551
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,727
- Rufus would like his Negroni.
- All right.

552
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,853
Thank you.

553
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,821
Hi.

554
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,114
Excuse me.

555
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,324
Rufus?

556
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,576
Oh, you found me.

557
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,577
Yes.

558
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,495
Hey, lose the clothes if it's all right.

559
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,330
Hope you like Air Supply.

560
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,750
I'm kind of kind of
on a ballad jag right now.

561
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,761
You look different
than your picture on the app.

562
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,926
It's Todd, right?

563
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,929
Actually,
I'm here for "Battlestar."

564
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,557
- You're not Will.
- No.

565
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,267
He told me to use the code word.

566
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,810
I'm helping him out.

567
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,605
Here I'm about to blow you.

568
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,150
I got your shit in my bag.

569
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,530
There you go.

570
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,826
It's okay if I count it?

571
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,202
You shittin' me?

572
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,086
These are pills.

573
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,379
Same ones, man.

574
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,964
But faster acting.

575
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
I got a new source in Quebec.

576
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,551
What about the 50 grand?

577
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,968
The 50 grand?

578
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,641
Would you settle for that blowjob?

579
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>It turns out
Rufus has been supplying OG Will</i>

580
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,279
<i>with off-brand Canadian meds</i>

581
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,157
<i>for a rather severe bipolar disorder.</i>

582
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,284
<i>Explains so much.</i>

583
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,872
<i>Evidently,
Will kept just enough of a grip</i>

584
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,624
<i>to turn me into his TaskRabbit.</i>

585
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
<i>But hey, he needs them.</i>

586
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,170
Nope, I won't take 'em. Flush 'em!

587
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,341
Keep your poison.

588
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,926
What do you mean?

589
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,178
I went to the Valley for you.

590
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,016
<i>Farewell to that small part of Will
aspiring to sanity, I guess.</i>

591
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,975
You'll feel better.

592
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,020
Yeah, then you take 'em, fucker,
'cause I don't believe you.

593
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,022
You should believe me!

594
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Believe me when I tell you...

595
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,235
I could hand you to Jasper.

596
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,445
I wouldn't have your problems anymore.

597
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,330
<i>Learned something today.</i>

598
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,958
<i>Screaming at crazy</i>

599
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,584
<i>can reopen a wound.</i>

600
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>Love, this is trial by fire for you.</i>

601
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,364
Hey, I really think
we need to talk.

602
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,936
Oh.

603
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,938
Hey.

604
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,398
Hey.

605
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,985
Oh, my God! What happened?

606
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,236
Oh, it's... it's nothing.

607
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,029
- Oh, no, what did you do?
- No, it's fine.

608
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,615
It's a cut, it's nothing.
What do you want to talk to me about?

609
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
You lied to me.

610
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,582
- What?
- Lunch.

611
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,083
Forty?

612
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,213
He's a bad alibi. He's been telling me
everything since we were born.

613
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,798
<i>Shit.</i>

614
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,925
- Is Forty your brother?
- My twin brother.

615
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,637
And you called him a dick,
which he can be,

616
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,639
but you were also lying.

617
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,308
You own Anavrin.

618
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,645
<i>That's what I get for not trying
to find out everything about you first.</i>

619
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,647
My parents own Anavrin.

620
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,483
I just work there.

621
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,903
I was trying not to instantly
complicate things

622
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,237
by waiting to tell you.

623
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,990
But you...
you complicated things by lying.

624
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,159
Why would you lie?

625
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,496
<i>So I could walk through
fire for you.</i>

626
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,041
<i>So I could slay dragons to stay near you.</i>

627
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,960
- I just... I don't know you.
- Yet.

628
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,213
- You don't know me.
- Yeah, well, apparently.

629
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,714
Because I thought that we were...

630
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,010
I mean, we kissed, Will.

631
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,929
This is... This is not a good time.

632
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,430
This is not good timing.

633
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
This is about your ex, isn't it?

634
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,059
- <i>Yes.</i>
- No.

635
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,980
She <i>really</i> hurt you.

636
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,607
<i>I can smell your shampoo,</i>

637
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,610
<i>and nothing you're doing is making it
easier for me to see you clearly.</i>

638
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,071
But guess what? My husband hurt me, too.

639
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,490
Among other things, by dying.

640
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,910
So, I understand why this is hard for you,

641
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,663
but it's also why I just say things now.

642
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,875
'Cause there was things
I was waiting to say to him.

643
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,255
And I... I don't know
if this is just a fling

644
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,632
or something more, but either way...

645
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,941
I think it's a mistake to do
the bullshit thing that you're doing.

646
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,529
- No, it's not bullshit...
- Yes, it is!

647
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,138
You don't need to run away.

648
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,765
Please, no.

649
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,600
- Stop.
- You can...

650
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,060
Please! Stop!

651
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,646
Just stop!

652
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,778
Okay.

653
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,906
You don't need to yell.

654
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,908
Ever.

655
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,122
I liked you.

656
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,294
This sucks.

657
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,383
You're bleeding again.

658
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,016
Why are you here?

659
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,852
You've actually lost
a lot of blood today, Joe.

660
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,935
Is that what you are?

661
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,271
My lost blood?

662
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,065
Really all-in on this one.

663
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,067
I guess that's you, right?

664
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,320
See a girl once.

665
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,905
I'm... I'm trying...

666
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,115
to do it right this time.

667
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,325
As opposed to with me.

668
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,621
What went wrong with me, Joe?

669
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,540
We both know what happened.

670
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,958
You can haunt me forever,

671
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,837
you will never get me to say
I didn't do everything I could for you...

672
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,256
- for us.
- Look at me, Joe.

673
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,716
- No, you are not...
- Look at me.

674
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,344
You are not here.
I am not arguing with you!

675
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,613
Hey, Jasper, yeah.

676
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,532
Yes, it's Will.

677
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,076
I am on my way.

678
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,913
Thank you for coming. Is that my...?

679
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,058
Perfectly preserved
and anxious to get back to Daddy.

680
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,291
Great. It's right in here.

681
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
Look...

682
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,549
I am not Will Bettelheim.

683
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,679
This is.

684
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,141
Well, this is a first for me.

685
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,688
My name is Joe Goldberg.

686
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,023
I just needed his name

687
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,234
and his life for a little while.

688
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,778
So you put him in
a Hannibal Lecter thing, I see that.

689
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,572
I assume you realize
that you need psychiatric help?

690
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,699
I'm not crazy, okay?

691
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,743
My ex-girlfriend's stalking me
and this is the best I could come up with.

692
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,954
But can I please have my finger?
'Cause this is Will.

693
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,081
He took your money. Take him.

694
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,041
Well, if you couldn't get it out of him...

695
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583
Right?

696
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,168
I mean...

697
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,755
You sure, now?

698
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,011
- You ain't got it?
- Please don't.

699
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,638
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to...

700
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,008
You see, Joe?

701
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,763
No.

702
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,972
You don't understand.

703
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,056
But I do.

704
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,227
I'm trying to survive.
He wanted to hurt me.

705
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,146
Well, you hurt him.

706
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,608
And you hurt me.

707
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,820
I loved you.

708
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,657
- More than I've ever...
- Then you hurt me.

709
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,797
Look at me, Joe.

710
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Sometimes...

711
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,682
we hurt the one we love.

712
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,183
Right?

713
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,772
You're not afraid Love will hurt you.

714
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,444
You're afraid you'll hurt her.

715
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,490
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,788
I'm so sorry.

717
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,752
No. Please stay.

718
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,546
Please.

719
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,421
Stay.

720
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,554
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,514
I'm so sorry.

722
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,613
<i>Hendy was right.</i>

723
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,867
<i>Dr. Daniel, one impressive microsurgeon.</i>

724
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,535
<i>Thank goodness for these pain pills.</i>

725
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,329
<i>They're gonna block out
more than one type of pain tonight.</i>

726
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,250
<i>Knocking out Anavrin's security cameras
will cover up another.</i>

727
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,927
<i>Sometimes I wonder
if I understand love at all.</i>

728
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,597
<i>The thing transforms us.</i>

729
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,265
<i>But into what?</i>

730
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,103
<i>Love turned me into something else
back then with Beck.</i>

731
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,319
<i>My hope now...</i>

732
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,031
<i>is that you can turn me
into something better.</i>

733
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,451
<i>Because of this is all I am,</i>

734
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,537
<i>I may as well turn myself into Candace.</i>

735

00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,356
Hey.

744
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,068
Wow, it smells amazing in here.

745
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,866
I did not just make you an entire meal.

746
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,451
I am angry and embarrassed

747
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,494
and I shouldn't have texted you back.

748
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,620
I just...

749
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,915
I was just also hungry, so I... you know...

750
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,585
I'm glad you kissed me.

751
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,213
It did not seem like it.

752
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,297
I was.

753
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,715
I was also freaked out,

754
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,260
not because you did it,
but because of how it felt.

755
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,720
I didn't expect...

756
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,056
you.

757
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,556
This.

758
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:12,932
I wasn't looking...

759
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,852
for this.

760
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,562
I want it, but I can't...

761
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,814
have it...

762
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,067
right now with you...

763
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,402
or... or anyone.

764
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,073
She really hurt you, huh?

765
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,823
Mm.

766
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,909
No.

767
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,996
No, I hurt her.

768
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,624
I really hurt her.

769
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,752
So you understand, I can't...

770
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,045
Did you wanna hurt her?

771
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,713
No.

772
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,966
Of course not.

773
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,553
So what I'm hearing is that two adults...

774
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,680
both knowing the risks...

775
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,015
I don't think she knew.

776
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,310
Okay, well, you know,
none of us know anything.

777
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,187
You know?
But you put on your big girl pants

778
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,147
and we give things a shot.

779
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,609
I have to believe that hurting her was
the last thing you wanted to do, right?

780
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,297
- That was a question.
- Yeah, that's right.

781
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,322
- Okay.
- Right.

782
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,783
How about I take care of me...

783
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,952
you take care of you...

784
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,081
I try not to hurt you,
you try not to hurt me.

785
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,624
You know, what else is there?

786
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm just...

787
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,589
I'm... I'm afraid.

788
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,470
Yeah.

789
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,682
Relationships are scary.

790
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,311
You don't get all that goodness
and possibility with zero risk.

791
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,063
But, Will...

792
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,234
you cannot hurt me.

793
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,320
<i>I want to believe that.</i>

794
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,449
Okay.

795
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,702
Thank you.

796
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,290
I just...

797
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,042
- Just come here.
- Okay.

798
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,669
Look, to be honest,

799
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,920
I feel...

800
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,423
so shitty...

801
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,259
about the way it went with her.

802
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,093
So I can't...

803
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,553
I can't...

804
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,013
till she's...

805
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,557
really gone.

806
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,852
No, it's valid.

807
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,062
Yeah, no, I...

808
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,772
Okay, two things.

809
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,899
One...

810
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,693
friends.

811
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,778
Okay, friends can be good.

812
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,906
We can just call this a friendship.

813
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,616
That might help.

814
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,618
Okay, great.

815
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,162
Poof, friends.

816
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,539
And two...

817
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,460
I felt the same way about James.

818
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,006
And I don't want to sound corny,
but I did this thing,

819
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,092
where I took a bunch of his stuff
and I put in a box and I...

820
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,969
let it go in the ocean.

821
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm not really one to hold on to things.

822
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,727
It's not... Um...

823
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,147
You could just, you know, write a note.

824
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,524
A goodbye.

825
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,195
Burn it.

826
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,737
Something.

827
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,448
And I would help you.

828
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,369
Friends support each other.

829
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,205
<i>Whatever you call us...</i>

830
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,541
<i>it feels right.</i>

831
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,377
<i>Because we're an "us."</i>

832
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,799
<i>And if we are an "us,"</i>

833
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,593
<i>then, dare I say it...</i>

834
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,094
<i>this...</i>

835
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,556
<i>this is home for now.</i>

836
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
<i>And I should probably be a good neighbor.</i>

837
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,937
Oh...

838
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,233
Try that guy.
These two are full and that one...

839
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,568
Eats the quarters, yeah.

840
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,613
You don't have to be all nice.

841
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,117
I feel bad, like I did something.

842
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,620
No, it's not you, you were just
in the line of fire when Henderson...

843
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,499
We go back.
We met, like, eight years ago

844
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,459
when I was dancing at this bar downtown.

845
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,548
Not just to do it, but because I was
actually pursuing something.

846
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,582
I wanted to be Carrie Fisher.
She's such a great writer.

847
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,554
But I was stuck in Covina
and my mom was such a cunt,

848
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,389
and one day, I was just like, "Fuck it.

849
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,224
Let me get a fake ID and get out of here

850
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,559
and go follow my dreams."

851
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,769
<i>It's hard to imagine her
with dreams.</i>

852
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,687
Henderson was cool.

853
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,357
He, like, gave me copies
of Syd Field, <i>Save the Cat.</i>

854
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
And he was like, "You're actually good,"

855
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,612
which nobody ever...

856
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,076
And I had heard, or whatever,

857
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,329
that he had young girls around,

858
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,540
but I just thought
I was talented and special.

859
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,335
One day, I was at his place,

860
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,338
and I had, like, three sips of beer,

861
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,798
and I got so fucked up.

862
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,093
Eight years ago? You were, like...

863
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,386
Seventeen.

864
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,097
Anyway, I remember being like,

865
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,599
"How is it ten p.m.?"

866
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,976
And I look down and...

867
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,562
my skirt was pulled up.

868
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,732
So you're saying Henderson...

869
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,567
Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.

870
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,570
Have you ever tried...?

871
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,781
To what? Tell anyone? No.

872
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,365
Who?

873
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,951
I tried to do a story years later,
but nobody would talk to me.

874
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,995
Guess why? They're all like I was.

875
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,496
Underage...

876
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,872
strippers...

877
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,166
not white...

878
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,168
The world would eat them alive.

879
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,422
And that's why I don't lose
a drop of sleep

880
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,226
on any of these motherfuckers
I write about.

881
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,342
They all deserve it.

882
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,763
My math says 49% of humanity
deserves to die in a fire.

883
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,060
Don't do that. You, like...

884
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,604
You nod as if you're somehow
not one of them.

885
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,357
Well, let me give you the gift of honesty.

886
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,649
You...

887
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,277
act nice because you're not.

888
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,239
And I may not know
what kind of bad you are...

889
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,158
but I got my radar the hard way.

890
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,992
So...

891
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,288
stay the fuck away from me
and my sister, okay?

892
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,834
Have a fantastic day.

893
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,103
Tell me I didn't eat those.

894
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,065
Do you know...

895
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,652
how much oxidative stress
those things put on your body?

896
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,572
I'm guessing a shower
is out of the question?

897
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,923
Did you say Jasper came around?

898
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,507
I paid the man.

899
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,010
And he went on his way.

900
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,890
If things were different,
I'd say I owe you 50 grand.

901
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,093
- Why? You got it laying around somewhere?
- Nice try.

902
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:11,976
It's spent.

903
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,773
- What were you thinking?
- Honestly...

904
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,235
a little while ago I fell in love.

905
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,529
And she needed help.

906
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,032
So I just did it.

907
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,336
You've been putting meds
in my drinks, huh?

908
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,419
That's green juice.

909
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,588
Thanks.

910
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,760
Well, my current reality is...

911
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,387
suboptimal, but even so,

912
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,889
upgrade from where I was.

913
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,851
At one point,
I thought I saw you murder a guy.

914
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,107
Crazy town.

915
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,528
Well, glad to have you back.

916
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,082
<i>I guess it's goodbye, Beck.</i>

917
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,627
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

918
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,754
<i>I really am.</i>

919
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,300
<i>Goodbye, you.</i>

920
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,180
How did that feel?

921
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,185
Like a good first step.

922
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,023
<i>Still can't wait to tell our story
to our kids.</i>

923
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,360
<i>How we decided to walk before we ran.</i>

924
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,529
<i>Started out as friends.</i>

925
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,618
<i>The past...</i>

926
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,413
<i>is prologue.</i>

927
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,083
<i>I made mistakes, yes.</i>

928
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,961
<i>And I'll learn from them.</i>

929
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,754
<i>Prove...</i>

930
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,382
<i>I'm worthy...</i>

931
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,924
<i>of you.</i>

932
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,729
Hey, should I open another bottle?

933
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,075
<i>I know we'll get there.</i>

934
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,661
<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

935
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,537
<i>It's just...</i>

936
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,249
<i>who I am.</i>

937
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,648
