Okay.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,652
Love, this is my son, Theo.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,987
Didn't know you had a son.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,949
I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,243
I'm at the hospital.
Henry has the measles.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,829
- Who do you think it was?
- Not closed yet, are you?

10
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,248
Can't tell you
how sorry we are for exposing Henry.

11
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
We hope you won't hold it against us.

- Yep?

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,388

<i>Can't say it was a shock.</i>

32
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,332
I was shocked.

33
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,502
I said, "Gil? Nice guy Gil?"

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,671
'Course she told me what you said.

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:15,218
Not that it justified what she did.
The thing is, if you could have seen...

36
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,013
what she went through
in the hospital with our baby...

Here.

38
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,065
Still, she should not have done this.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
That's for sure.

40
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,241
It's a proofing room.
Something about temperature and humidity.

41
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,954
Keeps the dough from getting a tough skin.
I'm not sure I understand any of it.

That's Margaret with her gardening.

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,626

46

Love and I are very embarrassed.

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,346
Is there any chance
we could keep this between us?

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,850
We will not tell a soul
how you recklessly endangered our son.

49
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,853
- I don't know I would put it like that.
- No? How?

50
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,690
Well, it's just... No judgment.

51
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,277
But to dose an infant
with chemicals we know nothing about?

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,487
- I mean, I call that reckless.
- Hmm.

53
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,158
Actually, your son has naturally
gained immunity, so...

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,493
I'd say it was beneficial.

55
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,333
You know what? I'm sorry.

56
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,502
- I'm sorry, I get carried away.
- No, no, no.

57
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,048
You might be right, yeah.

58
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,885
- Our child is fine.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,597
Here.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,022
Here, let me help you up.

61
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,150
Ooh.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,242
So, what do you say, bygones?

63
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,873
Okay.

64
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,086
Sure. Bygones.

65
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,548
<i>He's lying.</i>

66
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,926
- Are you absolutely sure?
<i>- I'm cool!</i>

67
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,011
<i>I'm cool. Let me out, please?</i>

68
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,138
No doubt. He'll go straight to the police.

69
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,766
- Fuck.
<i>- Guys, let's be grown-ups about this!</i>

70
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,810
- Now what?
<i>- Come on!</i>

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,574
Here we go. Coming in hot, Henry. Hey.

72
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,162
Got to bank to the left.
Here. Open. There we go.

78
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,425
I did have a thought.

79
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
Mutually-assured destruction.

80
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,099
Get something that he doesn't want
anyone else to know about

81
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,143
and he can't expose us.

82
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,106
- He opens his mouth, we open ours.
- Worked for me once before.

90
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,855
Gil is MIA. He was our reader today,

91
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,274
and I told Lansing
I'd run the boys to the dentist.

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,361
- <i>He did not just say "Gil."</i>
- That's so not like Gil.

You know better than that.
Not even the saints were saints.

96
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,705
Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.

97
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,624
- I could read to the kids.
- I've got it.

98
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,708

00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>has me dangerously distracted.</i>

158
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>What if we did leave something
for John and Betty Volunteer to find?</i>

159
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>But we weren't careless, were we?</i>

160
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,473
<i>Focus! One thing at a time.</i>

161
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,103
<i>Need to find Gil's fatal flaw.</i>

162
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,024
<i>"Geology rocks." "Schist happens."</i>

163
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,444
<i>If I've mined anything, it's that
"Rock Star" Professor Gil Brigham</i>

164
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,279
<i>has a taste for geologist humor.</i>

165
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>Once taught at Burgess College
in Columbus, Ohio.</i>

166
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>Left in his second year. In October. Hmm.</i>

167
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
<i>It's abrupt.</i>

168
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,913
<i>Did he transgress with a co-ed?</i>

169
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,666
<i>"Sophomore Burgess student
victim of campus attack."</i>

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>Could it be...?</i>

171
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,502
<i>Hmm.</i>

172
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,925
<i>Four hours in
and the only fault I can find</i>

173
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,719
<i>is Gil's sense of humor.</i>

174
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,889
<i>Spotless academic career, church,
a dedication to his kids so deep</i>

175
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,850
<i>he may be the inspiration
for those World's Greatest Dad mugs.</i>

176
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,977
<i>Never misses a game, a birthday...</i>

177
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
<i>Look, he volunteers
at the children's ward...</i>

178
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,856
<i>And shit! The library.</i>

179
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,441
<i>Better account for today.</i>

180
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,613
<i>Sorry to miss today. A little work crisis.</i>

181
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,990
<i>Sorry to disappoint the kids.</i>

182
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,825
- Who are we stalking?
- Hey.

183
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,411
- No, no, I'm just...
- You seen <i>Peer Gynt?</i>

184
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,580
<i>Yes. In that I stole it for Ellie.</i>

185
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,958
Yeah, I may have taken it home for a read.

186
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,420
You took a 2500-dollar book
that isn't supposed to leave?

187
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,215
You know how when you know a rule exists,

188
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,550
but you don't think it applies to you

189
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
because you're quick
and careful, and you work here.

190
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,015
For those of us who didn't grow up
with first editions for coasters...

191
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,726
I'm sorry,
you think that I come from money?

192
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,854
<i>Look what you've done to me, Love.
I smell like the rich now.</i>

193
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,356
Just let me say this.

194
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,983
There were no first editions
on the shelves growing up

195
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,152
because there were no... shelves.

196
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,863
- Right. You were poor.
- Practically homeless.

197
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,492
A bookstore owner took me in
and let me work for free,

198
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,120
and I slept in a cage in his basement.

199
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
No, wait. Marienne, hang on.
Wait, I'm sorry.

200
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,335
I'm sorry. Stop. That crossed the line.
It was an exaggeration.

201
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,671
We straddled the poverty line
my entire childhood,

202
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,049
and I escaped with books.

203
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,884
I learned all about them,

204
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,637
like you wanna know everything
about that one beautiful thing.

205
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,391
It saves your miserable life.

206
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,310
So I...

207
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,273
I misjudged a little, maybe.

208
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,735
Generally, my favorite apologies
are stiff and grudging...

209
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,278
Fair.

210
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,864
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,031
Ah...

212
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,996
And I guess I might have
to like you after all, Goldberg.

213
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,373
- Perish the thought.
- Hmm.

214
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,377
Since we're friends now,
what else did you take?

215
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,504
<i>A Dickens, a Shelley,
a signed early Strand.</i>

216
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,672
- Nothing.
- Mm-hm.

217
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,384
Make sure that's still true
when I look real hard tomorrow.

218
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,468
Okay?

219
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,314
- Thought we had a deal!
- We did. I'm sorry.

220
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,109
You know, you can't keep me in here
like some animal.

221
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,739
People know that I was coming here.
So you can let me out or the police can.

222
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,284
- When they come looking...
- No one's gonna save you. We...

223
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,538
We already made excuses on your behalf.

224
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,332
Uh...

225
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,502
I'm sorry, Gil.
I want to let you out, man.

226
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,712
I won't tell a soul.

227
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,838
I promise.

228
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,925
I told you, we can keep this between us.

229
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,428
Say...

230
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,390
we knew something about you.

231
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,938
Something you really don't want
anyone to know.

232
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,150
Right, I see.

233
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,861
Okay, I keep your secret, you keep mine.

234
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,865
And this time,
you'll keep your end of the deal?

235
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,949
Yes.

236
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,702
Okay. Okay.

237
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,957
Just... Give me a minute to think.

238
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,377
I got it!

239
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,003
Okay, listen.

240
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:06,011
Couple years back, our church group went
to a festival for Christ in Vegas.

241
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,473
<i>Christ? Vegas?
Strong starter ingredients.</i>

242
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,810
We raised funds for the Santoses,

243
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,937
who'd lost their home to a fire.

244
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,817
And now, there's this woman, Cheryl.

245
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,361
<i>Christ. Vegas. Cheryl.</i>

246
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,115
Real, you know, fun-lover.
You know the type.

247
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,535
Anyway, everyone else had gone to bed,

248
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,497
but she and I have
a little more in our tanks.

249
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,581
So...

250
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,045
So we take the 600 dollars
that we'd raised, and...

251
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,757
<i>A room with a pile of blow
and a dominatrix dressed as a nun.</i>

252
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,593
<i>Why didn't I start here this morning?</i>

253
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,511
We put it all on red.

254
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,892
And lost.

255
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,562
That sucks. Then what?

256
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,190
Then we had to recoup it
from our own savings that Monday.

257
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,029
- That's it?
- "That's it?"

258
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:10,159
- We gambled and lost the Santoses' money.
- And you returned it... It was a Monday?

259
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah, but we lied.

260
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,913
You know, we were selfish.

261
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,624
If people knew that, are you kidding me?

262
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,211
Okay.

263
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,214
Okay, fine. I slept with her.

264
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,382
I did.

265
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,303
Real rough-style too.

266
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,017
- Can you define "rough style"?
- You know, when...

267
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm trying to give you something.

268
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
- Got to do better, Gil.
- Fuck!

269
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,067
Fuck.

270
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,405
So I managed to rolling-pin
the only saint in Madre Linda?

271
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,032
Not even the saints are saints.

272
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,786
But, look, I... I don't know.

273
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,287
My mom's taking Henry tomorrow.

274
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,790
- With everything...
- It's a good idea.

275
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,873
<i>"Committee to Find Natalie Engler"</i>

276
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,087
<i>is organizing a search party in
Redwood State Park, which is Natalie's...</i>

277
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,588
Better give her a frozen one.

278
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,133
In case of an earthquake, right? Or...

279
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,678
we're taken in for questioning.

280
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,471
Joe?

281
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,227
- Tell me not to panic.
- There's nothing for them to find.

282
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,353
What if they do?

283
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,316
What if they get a search warrant
or they start looking around?

284
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,151
"What's in this basement?"

285
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>Why is it feeling
like this has become my fault?</i>

286
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,408
<i>It's your fault
your mommy left you here, Goldberg.</i>

287
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,537
We need to get rid of Gil.

288
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,789
We can't have this hanging over our heads.

289
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,872
I know.

290
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,128
Okay, so we built the cage
so that we could stop and think.

291
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,588
What if we've done that and now...?

292
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,761
- What? And now what?
<i>- What you gonna do, Goldberg?</i>

293
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,180
He's gonna cry.

294
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,766
Just like he cries for his mommy
in bed very night.

295
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,186
We didn't want... to do this.

296
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,189
- We did this to protect our family.
<i>- It had to be done.</i>

297
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,568
You were protecting me.
You're a good boy, Joey.

298
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,070
What if the only option is for Gil to...?

299
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,657
<i>She's not coming for you.</i>

300
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,826
No one is coming to save you.

301
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,578
Yeah.

302
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,581
Give me a better idea.

303
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,209
- I can't believe you're saying this.
- I'm just asking questions.

304
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,878
You're saying, "I don't know."

305
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,297
You hit him and put him in a cage
when we could've...

306
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,923
- Sued him.
- The cage was your idea.

307
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,593
- No, no, no. We are not going to...
- How...?

308
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,971
You are not making me kill anyone!

309
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,768
We are not doing that to our son.

310
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
I shouldn't.

311
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,462
Not exactly getting my run in down here.

312
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,718
Used to be my son Alan and I
got out there every morning.

313
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,679
Before he went off to Dartmouth.

314
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,893
- He'd get a kick out of this.
- He would?

315
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,729
Come on. His pops knocked down a peg?

316
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,147
You know...

317
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
sons and their fathers.

318
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,736
Yeah, I'm new to it.

319
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,697
You kidding?
This idea that you have to mold them

320
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,991
into a good strong man...

321
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,284
How'd you?

322
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,327
Mm.

323
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,707
I came to realize it's a lot simpler
than I was making it.

324
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,459
Here's what you do as a parent:

325
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,588
You keep them healthy and safe
and be a good person.

326
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,678
That's it. Protect, be good,
get out of the way.

327
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,471
To be honest, I'm jealous.

328
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
You have it all ahead of you.

329
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,775
Hey, um...

330
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,115
whatever happens here,
I just hope I get to see them again.

331
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:28,292
...hoping we can buy another 30 acres
of this wonderful property on the coast

332
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,837
that apparently gets
this great fog Pinot thrives in.

333
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,257
Sweetie, hand me
those fleece-y p.j.'s in case it's cold.

334
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,760
Butt Paste. He's been a bit red lately.
So I'm gonna...

335
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,765
Worried?
If you think this vineyard business

336
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,560
is going to jeopardize the bakery,
it's the opposite.

337
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:51,315
- This is how empires are born.
- Yeah, it's actually not that. I, um...

338
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,904
Does Dad still have that guy Cy?

339
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,616
Probably has that little snake digging
into me right now.

340
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
Why, what's up?

341
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,953
I know it was something.

342
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,122
Oh, it's no big. I just...

343
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,210
I got a weird vibe from the guy
I rent the bakery from.

344
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,680
I wanna make sure he's legit.
I don't want to put in all of this work

345
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,257
just to have the property seized
by the IRS.

346
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,509
I'll get you his number.

347
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,905
I did something you're not gonna
be totally... psyched about.

348
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,157
Try me.

349
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,827
My mom...

350
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,250
gave me a number for a guy
that my dad uses to look into people.

351
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,003
You involved your family?

352
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,674
I didn't tell them anything. Okay?

353
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,971
I contacted him directly.
I didn't tell him why. He's discreet.

354
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,309
- You're mad at me anyway.
- I'm not mad. I'm worried.

355
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,395
I'm worried.

356
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,356
- That we can't deal with this?
- That you'll hate me

357
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,400
if we don't do it the right way.

358
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,070
The look on your face when you said
you thought Henry would be hurt if...

359
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm sorry. I...

360
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,035
I scared you.

361
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,869
No.

362
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Joe...

363
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,625
it broke my heart.

364
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,462
I see how hard
you're trying to be a good dad.

365
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,009
You're scared one little move is
gonna magically fuck it all up.

366
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,179
No, I know it's not magic
because I saw it growing up, how...

367
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,934
What kids are exposed to sticks.
Fucks them up for life.

368
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,603
You've been through a lot.
You're not fucked up for life.

369
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,188
I know.

370
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,609
But I don't wanna roll the dice
with Henry.

371
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,695
I... You know I understand.

372
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,699
I think about it with Forty.
If he'd grown up differently, maybe...

373
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,869
I get it.

374
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,121
I'm just...

375
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,666
trying to fix this.

376
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,836
Hey.

377
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,255
I love you.

378
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,939
Hey, Cy.
No, of course I'm not busy. What is it?

379
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,031
Really?

380
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,076
Oh, that's rich.

381
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,871
I cheated to get my son
into Dartmouth? Why?

382
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,041
Alan is a stellar student.
Not the world's best test-taker...

383
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,252
Dartmouth received perfect test scores
from your son.

384
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:03,673
No. He got in on his GPA,
his essay and community service.

385
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,302
And his perfect SAT score.
And there's also...

386
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,972
Yeah, all-American water polo
until a career-ending injury.

387
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,976
- That isn't my son's transcript.
- No? 'Cause there's also this.

388
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,356
That's 50 K you donated
to a Bennett's Fund

389
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,192
to help underprivileged kids have
a shot at college.

390
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,195
- <i>You're good at this.</i>
- What's that got to do with anything?

391
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,699
There is no Bennett's Fund.
Or there is, but for kids like Alan.

392
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,992
<i>Disturbingly good.</i>

393
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,078
That's 25,000 to a Frye family

394
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,706
whose all-star cheerleader Vicky
graduated with Alan.

395
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,877
What? Did they agree to vouch
they build houses in Haiti or some shit?

396
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,342
Wait, wait, wait.

397
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,760
- Wait a second.
- What?

398
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,139
You had no idea, did you?

399
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,308
Why...?

400
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,478
Why would my wife...?

401
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,106
Oh, God.

402
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,732
Oh, no.

403
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,234
Alan.

404
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,987
Not again.

405
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,532
He promised he would be good.

406
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,119
<i>This is worse
than some college scandal.</i>

407
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,205
<i>Alan did something to this Vicky.</i>

408
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,373
<i>It was a payoff.</i>

409
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>His beloved Alan is a very bad young man
who hurts girls.</i>

410
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,591
It was Alan in Ohio, right?

411
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,802
The girl who was attacked...

412
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,305
sexually assaulted.

413
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,557
The reason you left.

414
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,852
And he did it again.

415
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,608
I believed
that it was just a onetime mistake.

416
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,068
I made my mistakes at that age, so I...

417
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,698
I did nothing.

418
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,577
Now another girl got hurt.

419
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,414
I made poor Margaret feel
like she had to do all this.

420
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,046
<i>Gil said fatherhood was
just about protecting them</i>

421
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,464
<i>and getting out of the way,</i>

422
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,593
<i>but that's clearly not enough
to keep his son from going wrong.</i>

423
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,721
<i>Which is terrifying
but also exactly what we needed</i>

424
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>to get Gil to play ball.</i>

425
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,311
<i>Our next move is to propose
his imminent relocation from Madre Linda.</i>

426
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:25,357
<i>Too bad for Ellie, my boss busted me,
so this book's back to the library.</i>

427
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
<i>I'll try again.</i>

428
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,111
<i>Now, as for Gil,
I wonder if he's marinated long enough.</i>

429
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,282
<i>What? No. No, no, no.</i>

430
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,997
Oh, my God!

431
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,501
Get it off. Get it off him.

432
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,586
- Get it off him!
- I'm trying!

433
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,464
I'm trying. I'm trying.

434
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,931
Joe, we can't just sit here all night.

435
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,976
I... I need you to talk to me.

436
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,898
We need to do something about this.
We need to come up with some plan.

437
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,485
Joe, I really need you to listen to me.

438
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,236
Joe.

439
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,240
Joseph Quinn-Goldberg!

440
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,492
Hey.

441
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,411
This is not our fault.

442
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,288
He did this.

443
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
It was his decision.

444
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,211
We did everything to keep our promise.

445
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,880
Why the fuck did he have to...

446
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,717
kill himself? Oh, my God.

447
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,094
He's already ruined his family.

448
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,474
Fuck.

449
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,898
The search is starting soon.

450
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,776
Okay, okay.

451
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,071
I will make an appearance for us.

452
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,951
And then I will be back
as soon as I can. Okay?

453
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,035
Okay.

454
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,705
Okay, okay, okay.

455
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,416
Oh, my God.

456
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,251
Joe.

457
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
I have a plan.

458
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,946
In case you find something.

459
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,716
Hi, can you guys hear me okay? Hi.

460
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,886
Okay. Fine.

461
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,472
Thank you all for showing up.

462
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,810
If I may say on behalf
of Natalie's beautiful family,

463
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,645
we are so grateful

464
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,773
to each and every one of you.

465
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,443
Natalie is a fixture of Madre Linda.

466
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,071
We need her,

467
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,281
and now she needs us.

468
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,201
So good luck out there and...

469
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,161

Hi, Matthew.

483
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:41,987
Hello.

484
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,909
- How are you holding up?
- Hmm.

485
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,536
I never really know
how to answer that question

486
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
when I'm out searching for my wife.

487
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,960
It's your... I'm sorry. I was just...
I just wanted to know...

488
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,088
I'm sorry this is happening.

489
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,382
I really am.

490
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,510
Well, I guess I have you to thank.

491
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,556
For getting Theodore to come.
He told me you talked to him.

492
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,519
- He called you a kind person.
- I barely said anything. I just...

493
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,146
He seems like a good kid.

494
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,024
Excuse me.

495
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,624
Yo, why is everyone so scared
of Sherry Conrad?

496
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,838
She is fucking pathetic, right?

497
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,716
I hear that her husband,

498
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,804
he has to take pharmaceutical molly
just so he can get it up for her.

499
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,471
Yeah.

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,893
Oh, and please tell me
you saw that speech, right?

501
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,065
I have to pee. Be right back.

502
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,193
Okay.

503
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,941
Awful, you know?

504
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,403
But if I was married
to a robot like Matthew Engler,

505
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,030
probably disappear too.

506
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,700
- Did you forget your bullhorn, Sherry?
- Theo!

507
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,244
If you have a theory,
make sure everyone hears it.

508
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,038
Everyone knows what you're doing.

509
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,457
You're trying to cash in
on someone else's tragedy,

510
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,001
- so you can sell your vegan panties...
- Hey! Theo!

511
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,878
And get all these likes on Instagram.

512
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,546
Count to ten, okay? Relax.

513
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,884
Hey, Sherry, are you okay?

514
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,764
He's having a very hard day.
He doesn't mean it.

515
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:13,848
Right, Theo?

516
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,602
You've done so much.

517
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,521
How about we just get back to it?

518
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,107
- Thank you.
- Of course.

519
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,108
Let's go.

520
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,200
- So that happened.
- "A hard day"?

521
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,328
Fucking seriously?

522
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,606
<i>Does it hurt, Joe?</i>

523
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,778
No idea why they did this to you?

524
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,154
It doesn't matter.

525
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,907
Counselors say I'm a lost cause.
I heard them.

526
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,325
Hey, no, no.

527
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,703
No kid is a lost cause.

528
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,080
Especially not you.

529
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,423
You know, if I were to adopt,
I would want an older kid.

530
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,760
You know why?
Because... you know who they are.

531
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,055
The whole messy truth.

532
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,767
And that's beautiful and worthwhile.

533
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,895
And exactly what I would want in my life.

534
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,899
No matter what happened in the past,

535
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,988
someone out there will want you too.
You're a good kid.

536
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,924
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,969
You calling Uber?

538
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,931
It's gonna rain. Get in.

539
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,651
Is that your best friend Sherry?

540
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,327
You know, it is really hard to stay mad

541
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,371
at the one person
that I can actually stand talking to.

542
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,791
Hmm. Stepdad still a brick wall?

543
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,795
He's got a lot going on.

544
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,595
But he's not a murderer.

545
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,976
Hey, how did you deal with it?

546
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,061
Like...

547
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,231
all the attention and the rubbernecking?

548
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,566
- You mean, about my brother?
- Yeah.

549
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,862
- I read the <i>Vanity Fair </i>article, so...
- Mm-hm.

550
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,866
He insisted that I cut his hair because
I was the only one that did it right.

551
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,245
And he loved the Ninja Turtle movie.

552
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,915
Uh, he always wanted to fast-forward
where the red one got hurt

553
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,667
because it made him too sad.

554
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,212
The shit that doesn't sell magazines.

555
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,925
The part where he was
a whole fucking human being.

556
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,845
The big,

557
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,931
beautiful, sensitive fucking heart.

558
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,725
He was the only person
who ever really knew me.

559
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,145
You know...

560
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,689
publicity...

561
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,985
it has a way of flattening.

562
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,988
Flattening you
and the people you love into types.

563
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:01,159
And it's really hard because nobody
will ever let you forget what happened.

564
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,285
Yeah.

565
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,595
Rain snuck up on us.

566
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,930
If it clears up soon,
we'll send people back out.

567
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,350
You can be honest.
Today accomplished absolutely nothing.

568
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,519
Besides something exciting
for the social media feeds

569
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,771
of people that barely knew my wife.

570
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,608
The search was always a long shot,

571
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,485
and you had no belief whatsoever
we'd find anything. None.

572
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,739
I've seen everything
up to this point, okay?

573
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,116
And, yes, usually, you're right.

574
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,077
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

575
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,581
I mean, if we did find something...

576
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,752
It would probably be something
that indicated she's not alive anymore.

577
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,341
I know this is hard.

578
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,261
And I'd just say to you,
let us keep working.

579
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,781

582

584

<i>Idiot me thought Natalie could
provide something I was missing.</i>

585
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,716
<i>When it became clear
she'd never belong exclusively to me,</i>

586
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,051

587
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,804
<i>I do not know what came over me.</i>

588
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:49,642
<i>Next thing I knew, I was standing there,
with an ax, her body on the ground.</i>

589
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,852
<i>And when I put her in the ocean,</i>

590
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,106
<i>I felt like I was possessed
by someone else.</i>

591
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,443
<i>But I am guilty all the same,
and I can't live with what I've done.</i>

592
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,656
<i>I'm sorry I hurt you.
And I'm sorry you found me like this.</i>

593
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,867
<i>I failed all of you. But especially Alan.</i>

594
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,955
<i>Didn't want to see in him
what I saw in myself.</i>

595
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,499
<i>Maybe you can mold him into a better man.</i>

596
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,377
<i>Tell him and the girls I love them.</i>

597
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:23,050
<i>And know that I love you, Megy.</i>

598
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,928
<i>More than you'll ever know.</i>

599
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,930
<i>Forgive me,</i>

600
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,518
<i>Your Gily.</i>

601
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,899
Yeah, well, someone wrote a think piece
about my parents' divorce.

602
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,276
Yeah.

603
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,070
It was about the first wives
of tech superstars

604
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,948
and how Silicon Valley discards women.

605
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,412
Thought that was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

606
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,041
Yeah, look at you now.
Got a family tragedy all your own.

607
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,421
I'm not trying to sound flip. It's just...

608
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,592
- Welcome to the club.
- Mm. Do I get a gift bag?

609
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,848
Or does terrible family tragedy
make people more fuckable?

610
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,685
'Cause... Could really use
a silver lining.

611
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,020
Um...

612
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,357
In my experience, yes, but...

613
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,818
you end up resenting
the people who think that fucking you

614
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,738
was somehow gonna make them
more interesting.

615
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,449
Like it's gonna rub off on them
or something.

616
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,619
Don't let people like that define you.

617
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,336
Find the people that get you.

618
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,421
Lean on them.

619
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,633
Forty... My brother, he never really...

620
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,926
got that.

621
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,602
So how do you know who those people are?

622
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
You just do.

623
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,529
Um...

624
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,367
- Don't do that.
- Yep.

625
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,499
Oh, shit. I got a text from my dad.

626
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,459
Whoa. They think they found something.

627
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,630
They think they might have just found
a murder weapon.

628
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,601
<i>Morning, everybody.</i>

629
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,522
<i>I'm Detective Falco
with the Madre Linda Police Department.</i>

630
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,608
<i>There's been a development
in the Natalie Engler investigation.</i>

631
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,862
<i>New evidence points to a suspect
in her disappearance</i>

632
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>- and potentially her murder.
- We are hardly criminal masterminds.</i>

633
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,073
Gily?

634
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,286
I got your text, honey.

635
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,456
I don't know why you insisted
on the kids staying with my mother.

636
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,835
<i>But sometimes
all it takes is a good story.</i>

637
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,547
<i>Make it solid, sexy, relatable.</i>

638
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,553
<i>Give them just enough evidence.</i>

639
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,930
<i>It has come to our attention
that Mrs. Engler</i>

640
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,849
<i>was involved
in an extramarital relationship</i>

641
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,185
<i>with Madre Linda resident Gil Brigham,</i>

642
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,604
<i>a professor at Stanford University.</i>

643
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,025
<i>In a letter, Mr. Brigham confessed
he murdered Mrs. Engler and disposed...</i>

644
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:31,113
<i>And the town of Madre Linda settles
into begrudging acceptance</i>

645
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,533
<i>that the sordid tale
of suburban ennui, sex and murder</i>

646
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,160
<i>has come to an end</i>

647
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:40,164
<i>'cause, well, what bored suburbanite
isn't gonna buy that?</i>

648
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,926
<i>We did it, Love.</i>

649
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,970
<i>Let's be honest,
rebuilding the cage was crazy.</i>

650
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,098
<i>Could've really backfired.
And yet it worked.</i>

651
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,100
<i>We slowed down.</i>

652
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,353
<i>Reflected.</i>

653
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>Responded.</i>

654
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,775
<i>Proved we're a team. For Henry.</i>

655
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,665
You look terrible, Herr Gynt.

656
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,925
Oh.

657
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,928
- Sorry, a lot of long nights.
- Yeah, it's fine.

658
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,307
Dante was an absolute liability
when their younger was small.

659
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,643
Just forgot the Dewey Decimal System,

660
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:47,147
despite it literally being printed
on every aisle, in Braille.

661
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,732
<i>She's being nice to me.</i>

662
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,569
<i>Weird to think disclosing
one's shit childhood could do that.</i>

663
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,572
<i>Hers must not have been
exactly roses either.</i>

664
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,156
You have a kid, right?

665
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,994
- Mm-hm.
- How do you balance it?

666
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,372
She's with her dad these days.

667
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,666
<i>And she throws that away. Curious.</i>

668
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,168
Guess I don't need to ask if you've heard

669
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,131
about the whole awful Gil Brigham thing.

670
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,550
Yeah. Yeah, it's terrible.

671
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,633
Truly.

672
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,721
Does mean we need a new reader.

673
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,806
- You still interested?
- Sure.

674
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,933
- Of course.
- Great.

675
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,145
Oh, and I have a new rec for you.

676
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,939
<i>David Copperfield.</i>

677
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,734
You know, hardscrabble orphan
down on his luck.

678
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,444
Figured you could relate.

679
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,237
<i>She's teasing me, isn't she?</i>

680
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,616
- Ha.
- Anyway, if you wanted to apply

681
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,077
your wizard-level book repair skills,
have at it.

682
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:47,041
<i>It's almost like
you're flirting with me?</i>

683
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,002
<i>No. No, you wouldn't.
Well, not consciously.</i>

684
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,423
<i>This necklace thing, nervous habit?</i>

685
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:59,303
<i>Why would you be nervous unless...?
It couldn't be about me. Could it?</i>

686
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,721
You okay there, Joe?

687
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,599
<i>Oh, shit. What was I just doing?</i>

688
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,893
- I'm totally fine.
- Great.

689
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,480
<i>I cannot be thinking
about you like this. No.</i>

690
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,111
<i>No, no, no. This is bad.</i>
